Our Proven Teaching 
and Learning System
U
sers of Principles of Managerial Finance have praised the effectiveness of the
book’s Teaching and Learning System, which they hail as one of its hall-
marks. The system, driven by a set of carefully developed learning goals, has been
retained and polished in this thirteenth edition. The “walkthrough” on the pages
that follow illustrates and describes the key elements of the Teaching and
Learning System. We encourage both students and instructors to acquaint them-
selves at the start of the semester with the many useful features the book offers.
Six Learning Goals at the start of the
chapter highlight the most important con-
cepts and techniques in the chapter. Students
are reminded to think about the learning
goals while working through the chapter by
strategically placed learning goal icons.
Every chapter opens with a feature, titled
Why This Chapter Matters to You, that
helps motivate student interest by high-
lighting both professional and personal
benefits from achieving the chapter
learning goals.
Its first part, In Your Professional Life,
discusses the intersection of the finance
topics covered in the chapter with the con-
cerns of other major business disciplines. It
encourages students majoring in accounting,
information systems, management, mar-
keting, and operations to appreciate how
financial acumen will help them achieve
their professional goals.
The second part, In Your Personal Life,
identifies topics in the chapter that will
have particular application to personal
finance. This feature also helps students
appreciate the tasks performed in a busi-
ness setting by pointing out that the tasks
are not necessarily different from those
that are relevant in their personal lives.
Why This Chapter Matters to You
In your professional life
ACCOUNTING You need to understand the relationships between the
accounting and finance functions within the firm; how decision makers
rely on the financial statements you prepare; why maximizing a firm’s
value is not the same as maximizing its profits; and the ethical duty 
that you have when reporting financial results to investors and other
stakeholders.
INFORMATION SYSTEMS You need to understand why financial infor-
mation is important to managers in all functional areas; the documenta-
tion that firms must produce to comply with various regulations; and
how manipulating information for personal gain can get managers into
serious trouble.
MANAGEMENT You need to understand the various legal forms of a
business organization; how to communicate the goal of the firm to
employees and other stakeholders; the advantages and disadvantages
of the agency relationship between a firm’s managers and its owners;
and how compensation systems can align or misalign the interests of
managers and investors.
MARKETING You need to understand why increasing a firm’s revenues
or market share is not always a good thing; how financial managers
evaluate aspects of customer relations such as cash and credit manage-
ment policies; and why a firm’s brands are an important part of its
value to investors.
OPERATIONS You need to understand the financial benefits of
increasing a firm’s production efficiency; why maximizing profit by cut-
ting costs may not increase the firm’s value; and how managers act on
behalf of investors when operating a corporation.
Many of the principles of manage-
rial finance also apply to your per-
sonal life. Learning a few simple financial principles can help you
manage your own money more effectively.
In your personal life
Learning Goals
Define finance and the
managerial finance function.
Describe the legal forms of
business organization.
Describe the goal of the firm, and
explain why maximizing the value
of the firm is an appropriate goal
for a business.
Describe how the managerial
finance function is related to
economics and accounting.
Identify the primary activities of
the financial manager.
Describe the nature of the
principal–agent relationship
between the owners and
managers of a corporation, and
explain how various corporate
governance mechanisms attempt
to manage agency problems.

Each chapter begins with a short
opening vignette that describes
a recent real-company event
related to the chapter topic. These
stories raise interest in the chapter
by demonstrating its relevance in
the business world.
Learning goal icons tie chapter con-
tent to the learning goals and appear
next to related text sections and again in
the chapter-end summary, end-of-
chapter homework materials, and sup-
plements such as the Study Guide, Test
Item File, and MyFinanceLab.

In No Hurry to Go Public
F
acebook founder and chief executive officer
Mark Zuckerberg is in no hurry to go public, even
though he concedes that it is an inevitable step in the evolution of his firm. The Facebook CEO is
on record saying that “we’re going to go public eventually, because that’s the contract that we
have with our investors and our employees. . . . [but] we are definitely in no rush.” Nearly all
public firms were at one time privately held by relatively few shareholders, but at some point the
firms’ managers decided to go public. The decision to go public is one of the most important
decisions managers can make.
Private firms are typically held by fewer shareholders and are subject to less regulation
than are public firms. So why do firms go public at all? Often it is to provide an exit strategy for
its private investors, gain access to investment capital, establish a market price for the firm’s
shares, gain public exposure, or all of the above. Going public helps firms grow, but that and
other benefits of public ownership must be weighed against the costs of going public.
Although taking Facebook public would likely make Zuckerberg one of the richest persons
in the world under the age of 30, it would also mean that his firm would become subject to the
influences of outside investors and government regulators. A public firm’s managers work for and
are responsible to the firm’s investors, and government regulations require firms to provide
investors with frequent reports disclosing material information about the firm’s performance. The
regulatory demands placed on managers of public firms can sometimes distract managers from
important aspects of running their businesses. This chapter will highlight the tradeoffs faced by
financial managers as they make decisions intended to maximize the value of their firms.

1.1 Finance and Business
The field of finance is broad and dynamic. Finance influences everything that
firms do, from hiring personnel to building factories to launching new advertising
campaigns. Because there are important financial dimensions to almost any
aspect of business, there are many financially oriented career opportunities for
those who understand the basic principles of finance described in this textbook.
Even if you do not see yourself pursuing a career in finance, you’ll find that an
understanding of a few key ideas in finance will help make you a smarter con-
sumer and a wiser investor with your own money.

Corporations
A corporation is an entity created by law. A corporation has the legal powers of
an individual in that it can sue and be sued, make and be party to contracts, and
acquire property in its own name. Although only about 20 percent of all U.S.
businesses are incorporated, the largest businesses nearly always are; corpora-
tions account for nearly 90 percent of total business revenues. Although corpora-
tions engage in all types of businesses, manufacturing firms account for the
largest portion of corporate business receipts and net profits. Table 1.1 lists the
key strengths and weaknesses of corporations.

stockholders
The owners of a corporation,
whose ownership, or equity,
takes the form of either
common stock or preferred
stock.

Matter of Fact boxes provide inter-
esting empirical facts that add back-
ground and depth to the material
covered in the chapter.
Matter of fact
T
he P/E multiple approach is a fast and easy way to estimate a stock’s value. However, P/E
ratios vary widely over time. In 1980, the average stock had a P/E ratio below 9, but by the
year 2000, the ratio had risen above 40. Therefore, analysts using the P/E approach in the
1980s would have come up with much lower estimates of value than analysts using the model 
20 years later. In other words, when using this approach to estimate stock values, the estimate will
depend more on whether stock market valuations generally are high or low rather than on
whether the particular company is doing well or not.
Problems with P/E Valuation

If we simplify Equation 7.3, it can be rewritten as:
P0 = D0 * (1 + g)1
(1 + rs)1
+ D0 * (1 + g)2
(1 + rs)2
+ Á + D0 * (1 + g)q

Key equations appear in green boxes
throughout the text to help readers iden-
tify the most important mathematical
relationships. The variables used in these
equations are, for convenience, printed
on the back endpapers of the book.
The Equation for Present Value
The present value of a future amount can be found mathematically by solving
Equation 5.4 for PV. In other words, the present value, PV, of some future
amount, FVn, to be received n periods from now, assuming an interest rate (or
opportunity cost) of r, is calculated as follows:
(5.7)
Note the similarity between this general equation for present value and the equa-
tion in the preceding example (Equation 5.6). Let’s use this equation in an example.
PV =
FVn
(1 + r)n

The nominal interest rates on a number of classes of long-term securities in May
2010 were as follows:
Example 6.3 3
Security
Nominal interest rate
U.S. Treasury bonds (average)
3.30%
Corporate bonds (by risk ratings):
High quality (Aaa–Aa)
3.95
Medium quality (A–Baa)
4.98
Speculative (Ba–C)
8.97
Security
Risk premium
Corporate bonds (by ratings):
High quality (Aaa–Aa)
Medium quality (A–Baa)
Speculative (Ba–C)
8.97
- 3.30
= 5.67
4.98
- 3.30
= 1.68
3.95% - 3.30% = 0.65%
Because the U.S. Treasury bond would represent the risk-free, long-term security,
we can calculate the risk premium of the other securities by subtracting the risk-
free rate, 3.30%, from each nominal rate (yield):
Examples are an important component
of the book’s learning system. Numbered
and clearly set off from the text, they
provide an immediate and concrete
demonstration of how to apply financial
concepts, tools, and techniques.
Some Examples demonstrate time-value-
of-money techniques. These examples
often show the use of time lines, equa-
tions, financial calculators, and spread-
sheets (with cell formulas).

Review Questions appear at the
end of each major text section.
These questions challenge readers
to stop and test their understanding
of key concepts, tools, techniques,
and practices before moving on to
the next section.
In Practice boxes offer insights
into important topics in managerial
finance through the experiences of
real companies, both large and
small. There are three categories of
In Practice boxes:
Focus on Ethics boxes in every
chapter help readers understand
and appreciate important ethical
issues and problems related to
managerial finance.
Focus on Practice boxes take a
corporate focus that relates a busi-
ness event or situation to a specific
financial concept or technique.
Global Focus boxes look specifi-
cally at the managerial finance
experiences of international 
companies.
All three types of In Practice boxes
end with one or more critical
thinking questions to help readers
broaden the lesson from the con-
tent of the box.

focus on ETHICS
If It Seems Too Good to Be True Then It Probably Is
For many years,
investors around the
world clamored to invest with Bernard
Madoff. Those fortunate enough to
invest with “Bernie” might not have
understood his secret trading system,
but they were happy with the double-
digit returns that they earned. Madoff
was well connected, having been the
chairman of the board of directors of
the NASDAQ Stock Market and a
founding member of the International
Securities Clearing Corporation. His
credentials seemed to be impeccable.
However, as the old saying goes, if
something sounds too good to be true,
it probably is. Madoff’s investors
learned this lesson the hard way when,
on December 11, 2008, the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) charged Madoff with securities
fraud. Madoff’s hedge fund, Ascot
Partners, turned out to be a giant Ponzi
scheme.
Over the years, suspicions were
raised about Madoff. Madoff gener-
ated high returns year after year, seem-
ingly with very little risk. Madoff
credited his complex trading strategy
for his investment performance, but
other investors employed similar strate-
gies with much different results than
Madoff reported. Harry Markopolos
went as far as to submit a report to the
SEC three years prior to Madoff’s arrest
titled “The World’s Largest Hedge Fund
Is a Fraud” that detailed his concerns.a
On June 29, 2009, Madoff was
sentenced to 150 years in prison.
Madoff’s investors are still working to
recover what they can. Fraudulent
account statements sent just prior to
Madoff’s arrest indicated that investors’
accounts contained over $64 billion, in
aggregate. Many investors pursued
claims based on the balance reported
in these statements. However, a recent
court ruling permits claims up to the dif-
ference between the amount an investor
deposited with Madoff and the amount
they withdrew. The judge also ruled
that investors who managed to with-
draw at least their initial investment
before the fraud was uncovered are not
eligible to recover additional funds.
Total out-of-pocket cash losses as a
result of Madoff’s fraud were recently
estimated at slightly over $20 billion.

allowing investors to pursue 
claims based their most recent
accounts statements?

focus on PRACTICE
Limits on Payback Analysis
even more important than discounted
cash flow (NPV and IRR)—because it
spotlights the risks inherent in lengthy IT
projects. “It should be a hard and fast
rule to never take an IT project with a
payback period greater than 3 years,
unless it’s an infrastructure project you
can’t do without,” Campbell says.
Whatever the weaknesses of the
payback period method of evaluating
capital projects, the simplicity of the
method does allow it to be used in
conjunction with other, more sophisti-
cated measures. It can be used to
screen potential projects and winnow
them down to the few that merit more
careful scrutiny with, for example, net
present value (NPV).
3 In your view, if the payback period
method is used in conjunction with
the NPV method, should it be used
before or after the NPV evaluation?
in Barrington, Illinois. “The simplicity of
computing payback may encourage
sloppiness, especially the failure to
include all costs associated with an
investment, such as training, mainte-
nance, and hardware upgrade costs,”
says Douglas Emond, senior vice presi-
dent and chief technology officer at
Eastern Bank in Lynn, Massachusetts.
For example, he says, “you may be
bringing in a hot new technology, but
uh-oh, after implementation you realize
that you need a dot-net guru in-house,
and you don’t have one.”
But the payback method’s emphasis
on the short term has a special appeal
for IT managers. “That’s because the
history of IT projects that take longer
than 3 years is disastrous,” says
Gardner. Indeed, Ian Campbell, chief
research officer at Nucleus Research,
Inc., in Wellesley, Massachusetts, says
payback period is an absolutely essen-
tial metric for evaluating IT projects—
In tough economic
times, the standard for
a payback period is often reduced.
Chief information officers (CIOs) are
apt to reject projects with payback 
periods of more than 2 years. “We
start with payback period,” says 
Ron Fijalkowski, CIO at Strategic
Distribution, Inc., in Bensalem,
Pennsylvania. “For sure, if the payback
period is over 36 months, it’s not going
to get approved. But our rule of thumb
is we’d like to see 24 months. And if
it’s close to 12, it’s probably a no-
brainer.”
While easy to compute and easy
to understand, the payback periods sim-
plicity brings with it some drawbacks.
“Payback gives you an answer that tells
you a bit about the beginning stage of
a project, but it doesn’t tell you much
about the full lifetime of the project,”
says Chris Gardner, a cofounder of
iValue LLC, an IT valuation consultancy

GLOBAL focus
An International Flavor to Risk Reduction
Earlier in this chapter
(see Table 8.5 on
page 318), we learned that from
1900 through 2009 the U.S. stock
market produced an average annual
nominal return of 9.3 percent, but that
return was associated with a relatively
high standard deviation: 20.4 percent
per year. Could U.S. investors have
done better by diversifying globally?
The answer is a qualified yes. Elroy
Dimson, Paul Marsh, and Mike
Staunton calculated the historical returns
on a portfolio that included U.S. stocks
as well as stocks from 18 other coun-
tries. This diversified portfolio produced
returns that were not quite as high as
the U.S. average, just 8.6 percent per
year. However, the globally diversified
portfolio was also less volatile, with an
annual standard deviation of 17.8 per-
cent. Dividing the standard deviation
by the annual return produces a coeffi-
cient of variation for the globally 
diversified portfolio of 2.07, slightly
lower than the 2.10 coefficient of 
variation reported for U.S. stocks in
Table 8.5.
3 International mutual funds do 
not include any domestic assets
whereas global mutual funds include
both foreign and domestic assets.
How might this difference affect
their correlation with U.S. equity
mutual funds?

Summary
FOCUS ON VALUE
Time value of money is an important tool that financial managers and other
market participants use to assess the effects of proposed actions. Because firms
have long lives and some decisions affect their long-term cash flows, the effective
application of time-value-of-money techniques is extremely important. These
techniques enable financial managers to evaluate cash flows occurring at dif-
ferent times so as to combine, compare, and evaluate them and link them to the
firm’s overall goal of share price maximization. It will become clear in Chapters 6
and 7 that the application of time value techniques is a key part of the value
determination process needed to make intelligent value-creating decisions.
REVIEW OF LEARNING GOALS
Discuss the role of time value in finance, the use of computational tools,
and the basic patterns of cash flow. Financial managers and investors use time-
value-of-money techniques when assessing the value of expected cash flow
streams. Alternatives can be assessed by either compounding to find future value
or discounting to find present value. Financial managers rely primarily on
present value techniques. Financial calculators, electronic spreadsheets, and
financial tables can streamline the application of time value techniques. The
cash flow of a firm can be described by its pattern—single amount, annuity, or
mixed stream.

The end-of-chapter Summary con-
sists of two sections. The first sec-
tion, Focus on Value, explains
how the chapter’s content relates to
the firm’s goal of maximizing
owner wealth. The feature helps
reinforce understanding of the link
between the financial manager’s
actions and share value.
The second part of the Summary,
the Review of Learning Goals,
restates each learning goal and sum-
marizes the key material that was
presented to support mastery of the
goal. This review provides students
with an opportunity to reconcile
what they have learned with the
learning goal and to confirm their
understanding before moving 
forward.
An Opener-in-Review question at the
end of each chapter revisits the opening
vignette and asks students to apply a
lesson from the chapter to that business
situation.
Self-Test Problems, keyed to the
learning goals, give readers an opportu-
nity to strengthen their understanding
of topics by doing a sample problem.
For reinforcement, solutions to the Self-
Test Problems appear in the appendix at
the back of the book.
Warm-Up Exercises follow the Self-
Test Problems. These short, numerical
exercises give students practice in
applying tools and techniques presented
in the chapter.
Opener-in-Review
In the chapter opener you learned that it costs Eli Lilly close to $1 billion to bring a
new drug to market, and by the time all of the R&D and clinical trials are completed,
Lilly may have fewer than 10 years left to sell the drug under patent protection.
Assume that the $1 billion cost of bringing a new drug to market is spread out
evenly over 10 years, and then 10 years remain for Lilly to recover their investment.
How much cash would a new drug have to generate in the last 10 years to justify the
$1 billion spent in the first 10 years? Assume that Lilly uses a required rate of return
of 10%.

Comprehensive Problems, keyed to the
learning goals, are longer and more
complex than the Warm-Up Exercises.
In this section, instructors will find mul-
tiple problems that address the impor-
tant concepts, tools, and techniques in
the chapter.
A short descriptor identifies the essen-
tial concept or technique of the
problem. Problems labeled as
Integrative tie together related topics.
Personal Finance Problems specifi-
cally relate to personal finance situa-
tions and Personal Finance Examples in
each chapter. These problems will help
students see how they can apply the
tools and techniques of managerial
finance in managing their own finances.
The last item in the chapter Problems is
an Ethics Problem. The ethics problem
gives students another opportunity to
think about and apply ethics principles
to managerial financial situations.
All exercises and problems are available
in MyFinanceLab.
Every chapter includes a Spreadsheet
Exercise. This exercise gives students
an opportunity to use Excel® software
to create one or more spreadsheets with
which to analyze a financial problem.
The spreadsheet to be created often is
modeled on a table or Excel screenshot
located in the chapter. Students can
access working versions of the Excel
screenshots in MyFinanceLab.
An Integrative Case at the end of
each part of the book challenges stu-
dents to use what they have learned
over the course of several chapters.
Additional chapter resources, such as
Chapter Cases, Group Exercises, Critical
Thinking Problems, and numerous online
resources, intended to provide further
means for student learning and assess-
ment are available in MyFinanceLab at
www.myfinancelab.com.

Using a time line
The financial manager at Starbuck Industries is considering an
investment that requires an initial outlay of $25,000 and is expected to result in cash
inflows of $3,000 at the end of year 1, $6,000 at the end of years 2 and 3, $10,000
at the end of year 4, $8,000 at the end of year 5, and $7,000 at the end of year 6.
a. Draw and label a time line depicting the cash flows associated with Starbuck
Industries’ proposed investment.
b. Use arrows to demonstrate, on the time line in part a, how compounding to find
future value can be used to measure all cash flows at the end of year 6.
c. Use arrows to demonstrate, on the time line in part b, how discounting to find
present value can be used to measure all cash flows at time zero.

Time value
You can deposit $10,000 into an account paying 9% annual interest
either today or exactly 10 years from today. How much better off will you be at the
end of 40 years if you decide to make the initial deposit today rather than 10 years
from today?

P5–62
ETHICS PROBLEM
A manager at a “Check Into Cash” business (see Focus on
Ethics box on page 192) defends his business practice as simply “charging what the
market will bear.” “After all,” says the manager, “we don’t force people to come in the
door.” How would you respond to this ethical defense of the payday-advance business?

Merit Enterprise Corp.
S
ara Lehn, chief financial officer of Merit Enterprise Corp., was reviewing her
presentation one last time before her upcoming meeting with the board of direc-
tors. Merit’s business had been brisk for the last two years, and the company’s CEO
was pushing for a dramatic expansion of Merit’s production capacity. Executing the
CEO’s plans would require $4 billion in capital in addition to $2 billion in excess
cash that the firm had built up. Sara’s immediate task was to brief the board on
options for raising the needed $4 billion.
Unlike most companies its size, Merit had maintained its status as a private
company, financing its growth by reinvesting profits and, when necessary, borrowing
from banks. Whether Merit could follow that same strategy to raise the $4 billion
necessary to expand at the pace envisioned by the firm’s CEO was uncertain, though
it seemed unlikely to Sara. She had identified two options for the board to consider:
Integrative Case 1

recently paid a dividend of $3 per share. It expects its earnings—and hence its divi-
dends—to grow at a rate of 7% for the foreseeable future. Currently, similar-risk
stocks have required returns of 10%.

Preface
T
he desire to write Principles of Managerial Finance came from the experience
of teaching the introductory managerial finance course. Those who have
taught the introductory course many times can appreciate the difficulties that
some students have absorbing and applying financial concepts. Students want a
book that speaks to them in plain English and a book that ties concepts to reality.
These students want more than just description—they also want demonstration
of concepts, tools, and techniques. This book is written with the needs of students
in mind, and it effectively delivers the resources that students need to succeed in
the introductory finance course.
Courses and students have changed since the first edition of this book, but
the goals of the text have not changed. The conversational tone and wide use of
examples set off in the text still characterize Principles of Managerial Finance.
Building on those strengths, 13 editions, numerous translations, and well over
half a million U.S. users, Principles has evolved based on feedback from both
instructors and students, from adopters, nonadopters, and practitioners.
In this edition, Chad Zutter of the University of Pittsburgh joins the author
team. A recent recipient of the Jensen Prize for the best paper published in the
Journal of Financial Economics, Chad brings a fresh perspective to Principles.
Larry and Chad have worked together to incorporate contemporary thinking and
pedagogy with the classic topics that Gitman users have come to expect.
NEW TO THE THIRTEENTH EDITION
As we made plans to publish the thirteenth edition, we carefully assessed market
feedback about content changes that would better meet the needs of instructors
teaching the course.
The chapter sequence is similar to the prior edition, but there are some note-
worthy changes. The thirteenth edition contains 19 chapters divided into eight
parts. Each part is introduced by a brief overview, which is intended to give stu-
dents an advance sense for the collective value of the chapters included in the
part.
In Part 1, a new Chapter 2 expands coverage of financial markets and insti-
tutions, with particular emphasis on the recent financial crisis and recession. This
chapter not only explores the root causes and consequences of the financial crisis,
but it also discusses the changing regulatory landscape within which financial
institutions and markets function.
Part 2 contains three chapters in the same order in which they appeared in
the twelfth edition. These chapters focus on basic financial skills such as financial
statement analysis, cash flow analysis, and time-value-of-money calculations.
Part 3 focuses on bond and stock valuation. We moved these two chapters
forward in this edition, just ahead of the risk and return chapter, to provide stu-
dents with exposure to basic material on bonds and stocks that is easier to grasp
than some of the more theoretical concepts in the next part.

Part 4 contains the risk and return chapter as well as the chapter on the cost
of capital, which we have moved forward to lead into Part 5 on capital budg-
eting. We also moved up the chapter on the cost of capital so that it follows
directly on the heels of the risk and return material. We believe that this makes
the subsequent discussion of capital budgeting topics more meaningful because
students will already have an idea of where a project “hurdle rate” comes from.
Part 5 contains three chapters on various capital budgeting topics. A change
from the last edition here is that we present capital budgeting methods before the
chapter on capital budgeting cash flows.
Parts 6, 7, and 8 contain the same seven chapters in the same order that
appeared in the latter part of the twelfth edition. These chapters cover topics such
as capital structure, payout policy, working capital management, derivatives,
mergers, and international finance. Details about the revisions made to these
chapters appear below.
Although the text content is sequential, instructors can assign almost any
chapter as a self-contained unit, enabling instructors to customize the text to var-
ious teaching strategies and course lengths.
A number of new topics have been added at appropriate places, and new fea-
tures appear in each chapter. The Matter of Fact feature provides additional detail
and interesting empirical facts that help students understand the practical implica-
tions of financial concepts. For students who want to explore particular topics
more deeply on their own, the In More Depth feature, available on MyFinanceLab,
offers a guide for further study. In addition, as the detailed list shows, the chapter-
opening vignettes and In Practice boxes have been replaced or heavily revised: For
example, three-quarters of the chapter-opening vignettes are new, focusing on com-
panies such as Facebook, Abercrombie & Fitch, and Best Buy that have student
appeal, and more than half of the Focus on Ethics boxes are new. Also new to this
edition are Opener-in-Review questions, which appear at the end of each chapter.

changes in the thirteenth edition.

Preface

THE THIRTEENTH EDITION
Like the previous editions, the thirteenth edition incorporates a proven learning
system, which integrates pedagogy with concepts and practical applications. It
concentrates on the knowledge that is needed to make keen financial decisions in
an increasingly competitive business environment. The strong pedagogy and gen-
erous use of examples—including personal finance examples—make the text an
easily accessible resource for in-class learning or out-of-class learning, such as
online courses and self-study programs.
ORGANIZATION
The text’s organization conceptually links the firm’s actions and its value, as
determined in the financial market. Each major decision area is presented in
terms of both risk and return factors and their potential impact on owners’
wealth. A Focus on Value element at the end of each chapter helps reinforce the
student’s understanding of the link between the financial manager’s actions and
the firm’s share value.
In organizing each chapter, we have adhered to a managerial decision-
making perspective, relating decisions to the firm’s overall goal of wealth maxi-
mization. Once a particular concept has been developed, its application is
illustrated by an example—a hallmark feature of this book. These examples
demonstrate, and solidify in the student’s thought, financial decision-making con-
siderations and their consequences.
INTERNATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
We live in a world where international considerations cannot be divorced from the
study of business in general and finance in particular. As in prior editions, discus-
sions of international dimensions of chapter topics are integrated throughout the
book. International material is integrated into learning goals and end-of-chapter
materials. In addition, for those who want to spend more time addressing the
topic, a separate chapter on international managerial finance concludes the book.
PERSONAL FINANCE LINKAGES
The thirteenth edition contains several features designed to help students see the
value of applying financial principles and techniques in their personal lives. At the
start of each chapter, the feature titled Why This Chapter Matters to You helps
motivate student interest by discussing how the topic of the chapter relates to the
concerns of other major business disciplines and to personal finance. Within the
chapter, Personal Finance Examples explicitly link the concepts, tools, and tech-
niques of each chapter to personal finance applications. Throughout the homework
material, the book provides numerous personal finance problems. The purpose of
these personal finance materials is to demonstrate to students the usefulness of
managerial finance knowledge in both business and personal financial dealings.
ETHICAL ISSUES
The need for ethics in business remains as important as ever. Students need to under-
stand the ethical issues that financial managers face as they attempt to maximize
Preface

shareholder value and to solve business problems. Thus, every chapter includes
an In Practice box that focuses on current ethical issues.
HOMEWORK OPPORTUNITIES
Of course, practice is essential for students’ learning of managerial finance con-
cepts, tools, and techniques. To meet that need, the book offers a rich and varied
menu of homework assignments: short, numerical Warm-Up Exercises; a com-
prehensive set of Problems, including more than one problem for each important
concept or technique and personal finance problems; an Ethics Problem for each
chapter; a Spreadsheet Exercise; and, at the end of each part of the book, an
Integrative Case. In addition, the end-of-chapter problems are available in algo-
rithmic form in 
. These materials (see pages xi through xii for detailed
descriptions) offer students solid learning opportunities, and they offer instruc-
tors opportunities to expand and enrich the classroom environment.
MyFinanceLab
This fully integrated online homework system gives students the hands-on prac-
tice and tutorial help they need to learn finance efficiently. There are ample
opportunities for online practice and assessment that is automatically graded in
MyFinanceLab (www.myfinancelab.com).
Chapter Cases with automatically graded assessment are also provided in
MyFinanceLab. These cases have students apply the concepts they have learned
to a more complex and realistic situation. These cases help strengthen practical
application of financial tools and techniques.
MyFinanceLab also has Group Exercises where students can work together
in the context of an ongoing company. Each group creates a company and fol-
lows it through the various managerial finance topics and business activities pre-
sented in the textbook.
MyFinanceLab provides Critical Thinking Problems, which require students
to apply the various finance concepts and managerial techniques presented in the
textbook. These are rigorous problems that are designed to test a student’s ability
to understand the financial management situation, apply the necessary manage-
rial finance concepts, and find the value-maximizing solution.
An online glossary, digital flashcards, financial calculator tutorials, videos,
Spreadsheet Use examples from the text in Excel, and numerous other premium
resources are available in MyFinanceLab.
From classroom to boardroom, the thirteenth edition of Principles of
Managerial Finance can help users get to where they want to be. We believe that it
is the best edition yet—more relevant, more accurate, and more effective than ever.
We hope you agree that Principles of Managerial Finance, Thirteenth Edition, is
the most effective introductory managerial finance text for your students.

in the context of an ongoing company. Each group creates a company and fol-
lows it through the various managerial finance topics and business activities pre-
sented in the textbook.
MyFinanceLab provides Critical Thinking Problems, which require students
to apply the various finance concepts and managerial techniques presented in the
textbook. These are rigorous problems that are designed to test a student’s ability

To the Student
B
ecause you have a good many options for getting your assigned reading mate-
rials we appreciate your choosing this textbook as the best means for learning
in your managerial finance course. You should not be disappointed. In writing
this edition, we have been mindful of students and careful to maintain a student
focus.
The learning system in this book has been used by many of your predecessors
in the course and has been proven effective. It integrates various learning tools
with the concepts, tools, techniques, and practical applications you will need to
learn about managerial finance. We have worked hard to present in a clear and
interesting way the information you will need. This book is loaded with features
designed to motivate your study of finance and to help you learn the course mate-
rial. Go to pages vii–xii (“Our Proven Teaching and Learning System”) for an
overview and walkthrough of those features. Notice that the book includes
Personal Finance Examples (and related end-of-chapter problems) that show how
to apply managerial finance concepts and tools to your personal financial life.
About some of the specific features: First, pay attention to the learning goals,
which will help you focus on what material you need to learn, where you can find
it in the chapter, and whether you’ve mastered it by the end of the chapter.
Second, avoid the temptation to rush past the Review Questions at the end of
each major text section. Pausing briefly to test your understanding of the section
content will help you cement your understanding. Give yourself an honest assess-
ment. If some details are fuzzy, go back (even briefly) and review anything that
still seems unclear.
Third, look for (or make) opportunities to talk with classmates or friends
about what you are reading and learning in the course. Talking about the con-
cepts and techniques of finance demonstrates how much you’ve learned, uncovers
things you haven’t yet understood fully, and gives you valuable practice for class
and (eventually) the business world. While you’re talking, don’t neglect to discuss
the issues raised in the Focus on Ethics boxes, which look at some of the oppor-
tunities to do right (or not) that business people face.
MyFinanceLab opens the door to a powerful Web-based diagnostic testing
and tutorial system designed for this text. MyFinanceLab allows you to take
practice exams correlated to the textbook and receive a customized study plan
based on your results. The assignment Problems in MyFinanceLab, based on the
even-numbered end-of-chapter Problems in the book, have algorithmically gener-
ated values. Thus, the numbers in your homework will differ from those of your
classmates, and there is an unlimited opportunity for practice and testing. You
can get the help you need, when you need it, from the robust tutorial options,
including “View an Example” and “Help Me Solve This,” which breaks the
problem into steps and links to the relevant textbook page.
li

Given today’s rapidly changing technology, who knows what might be avail-
able next? We are striving to keep pace with your needs and interests, and would
like to hear your ideas for improving the teaching and learning of finance. 
We wish you all the best in this course and in your academic and professional
careers.

INTEGRATIVE CASE 1 Merit Enterprise Corp.
P
art 1 of Principles of Managerial Finance discusses the role that financial
managers play in businesses and the financial market environment in which 
firms operate. We argue that the goal of managers should be to maximize the value 
of the firm and by doing so maximize the wealth of its owners. Financial managers 
act on behalf of the firm’s owners by making operating and investment decisions
whose benefits exceed their costs. These decisions create wealth for shareholders.
Maximizing shareholder wealth is important because firms operate in a highly
competitive financial market environment that offers shareholders many alternatives 
for investing their funds. To raise the financial resources necessary to fund the firm’s
ongoing operations and future investment opportunities, managers have to deliver
value to the firm’s investors. Without smart financial managers and access to financial
markets, firms are unlikely to survive, let alone achieve the long-term goal of
maximizing the value of the firm.
Chapters in This Part

Why This Chapter Matters to You
In your professional life
ACCOUNTING You need to understand the relationships between the
accounting and finance functions within the firm; how decision makers
rely on the financial statements you prepare; why maximizing a firm’s
value is not the same as maximizing its profits; and the ethical duty 
that you have when reporting financial results to investors and other
stakeholders.
INFORMATION SYSTEMS You need to understand why financial infor-
mation is important to managers in all functional areas; the documenta-
tion that firms must produce to comply with various regulations; and
how manipulating information for personal gain can get managers into
serious trouble.
MANAGEMENT You need to understand the various legal forms of a
business organization; how to communicate the goal of the firm to
employees and other stakeholders; the advantages and disadvantages
of the agency relationship between a firm’s managers and its owners;
and how compensation systems can align or misalign the interests of
managers and investors.
MARKETING You need to understand why increasing a firm’s revenues
or market share is not always a good thing; how financial managers
evaluate aspects of customer relations such as cash and credit manage-
ment policies; and why a firm’s brands are an important part of its
value to investors.
OPERATIONS You need to understand the financial benefits of
increasing a firm’s production efficiency; why maximizing profit by cut-
ting costs may not increase the firm’s value; and how managers act on
behalf of investors when operating a corporation.
Many of the principles of manage-
rial finance also apply to your per-
sonal life. Learning a few simple financial principles can help you
manage your own money more effectively.

In No Hurry to Go Public
F
acebook founder and chief executive officer 
Mark Zuckerberg is in no hurry to go public, even
though he concedes that it is an inevitable step in the evolution of his firm. The Facebook CEO is
on record saying that “we’re going to go public eventually, because that’s the contract that we
have with our investors and our employees. . . . [but] we are definitely in no rush.” Nearly all
public firms were at one time privately held by relatively few shareholders, but at some point the
firms’ managers decided to go public. The decision to go public is one of the most important
decisions managers can make.
Private firms are typically held by fewer shareholders and are subject to less regulation
than are public firms. So why do firms go public at all? Often it is to provide an exit strategy for
its private investors, gain access to investment capital, establish a market price for the firm’s
shares, gain public exposure, or all of the above. Going public helps firms grow, but that and
other benefits of public ownership must be weighed against the costs of going public.
Although taking Facebook public would likely make Zuckerberg one of the richest persons
in the world under the age of 30, it would also mean that his firm would become subject to the
influences of outside investors and government regulators. A public firm’s managers work for and
are responsible to the firm’s investors, and government regulations require firms to provide
investors with frequent reports disclosing material information about the firm’s performance. The
regulatory demands placed on managers of public firms can sometimes distract managers from
important aspects of running their businesses. This chapter will highlight the tradeoffs faced by
financial managers as they make decisions intended to maximize the value of their firms.

PART 1
Introduction to Managerial Finance
1.1 Finance and Business
The field of finance is broad and dynamic. Finance influences everything that
firms do, from hiring personnel to building factories to launching new advertising
campaigns. Because there are important financial dimensions to almost any
aspect of business, there are many financially oriented career opportunities for
those who understand the basic principles of finance described in this textbook.
Even if you do not see yourself pursuing a career in finance, you’ll find that an
understanding of a few key ideas in finance will help make you a smarter con-
sumer and a wiser investor with your own money.
WHAT IS FINANCE?
Finance can be defined as the science and art of managing money. At the personal
level, finance is concerned with individuals’ decisions about how much of their
earnings they spend, how much they save, and how they invest their savings. In a
business context, finance involves the same types of decisions: how firms raise
money from investors, how firms invest money in an attempt to earn a profit, and
how they decide whether to reinvest profits in the business or distribute them
back to investors. The keys to good financial decisions are much the same for
businesses and individuals, which is why most students will benefit from an
understanding of finance regardless of the career path they plan to follow.
Learning the techniques of good financial analysis will not only help you make
better financial decisions as a consumer, but it will also help you understand the
financial consequences of the important business decisions you will face no
matter what career path you follow.
CAREER OPPORTUNITIES IN FINANCE
Careers in finance typically fall into one of two broad categories: (1) financial
services and (2) managerial finance. Workers in both areas rely on a common
analytical “tool kit,” but the types of problems to which that tool kit is applied
vary a great deal from one career path to the other.
Financial Services
Financial services is the area of finance concerned with the design and delivery of
advice and financial products to individuals, businesses, and governments. It
involves a variety of interesting career opportunities within the areas of banking,
personal financial planning, investments, real estate, and insurance. 
Managerial Finance
Managerial finance is concerned with the duties of the financial manager
working in a business. Financial managers administer the financial affairs of all
types of businesses—private and public, large and small, profit seeking and not
for profit. They perform such varied tasks as developing a financial plan or
budget, extending credit to customers, evaluating proposed large expenditures, and
raising money to fund the firm’s operations. In recent years, a number of factors
have increased the importance and complexity of the financial manager’s duties.
These factors include the recent global financial crisis and subsequent responses

by regulators, increased competition, and technological change. For example,
globalization has led U.S. corporations to increase their transactions in other
countries, and foreign corporations have done likewise in the United States. These
changes increase demand for financial experts who can manage cash flows in dif-
ferent currencies and protect against the risks that arise from international trans-
actions. These changes increase the finance function’s complexity, but they also
create opportunities for a more rewarding career. The increasing complexity of the
financial manager’s duties has increased the popularity of a variety of professional
certification programs outlined in the Focus on Practice box below. Financial
managers today actively develop and implement corporate strategies aimed at
helping the firm grow and improving its competitive position. As a result, many
corporate presidents and chief executive officers (CEOs) rose to the top of their
organizations by first demonstrating excellence in the finance function.
LEGAL FORMS OF BUSINESS ORGANIZATION
One of the most basic decisions that all businesses confront is how to choose a
legal form of organization. This decision has very important financial implica-
tions because how a business is organized legally influences the risks that the

certifications include the Chartered
Portfolio Manager, Chartered Asset
Manager, Certified Risk Analyst,
Certified Cost Accountant, Certified
Credit Analyst, and many other pro-
grams. See the AAFM website for
complete details on all of the
AAFM educational programs.
Professional Certifications in
Accounting—Most professionals 
in the field of managerial finance
need to know a great deal about
accounting to succeed in their jobs.
Professional certifications in
accounting include the Certified
Public Accountant (CPA), Certified
Management Accountant (CMA),
Certified Internal Auditor (CIA), and
many other programs.
3 Why do employers value having
employees with professional certifi-
cations?
Certified Treasury Professional
(CTP)—The CTP program requires
students to pass a single exam that
is focused on the knowledge and
skills needed for those working in a
corporate treasury department. The
program emphasizes topics such as
liquidity and working capital man-
agement, payment transfer systems,
capital structure, managing relation-
ships with financial service providers,
and monitoring and controlling
financial risks.
Certified Financial Planner (CFP)—
To obtain CFP status, students must
pass a 10-hour exam covering a
wide range of topics related to per-
sonal financial planning. The CFP
program also requires 3 years of
full-time relevant experience. The
program focuses primarily on skills
relevant for advising individuals in
developing their personal financial
plans.
American Academy of Financial
Management (AAFM)—The AAFM
administers a host of certification
programs for financial professionals
To be successful in
finance and just about
any other field, you need to continue
your education beyond your undergrad-
uate degree. For some people that
means getting an MBA, but there are
many other ways to advance your edu-
cation and enhance your credentials
without getting a graduate degree. In
finance, there are a variety of profes-
sional certification programs that are
widely recognized in the field.
Chartered Financial Analyst
(CFA)—Offered by the CFA
Institute, the CFA program is a
graduate-level course of study
focused primarily on the investments
side of finance. To earn the CFA
Charter, students must pass a series
of three exams, usually over a 
3-year period, and have 48 months
of professional experience. Although
this program appeals primarily to
those who work in the investments
field, the skills developed in the
CFA program are useful in a 
variety of corporate finance jobs 
as well.
in practice

firm’s owners must bear, how the firm can raise money, and how the firm’s profits
will be taxed. The three most common legal forms of business organization are
the sole proprietorship, the partnership, and the corporation. More businesses
are organized as sole proprietorships than any other legal form. However, the
largest businesses are almost always organized as corporations. Even so, each
type of organization has its advantages and disadvantages.
Sole Proprietorships
A sole proprietorship is a business owned by one person who operates it for his
or her own profit. About 73 percent of all businesses are sole proprietorships.
The typical sole proprietorship is small, such as a bike shop, personal trainer, or
plumber. The majority of sole proprietorships operate in the wholesale, retail,
service, and construction industries.
Typically, the owner (proprietor), along with a few employees, operates the
proprietorship. The proprietor raises capital from personal resources or by bor-
rowing, and he or she is responsible for all business decisions. As a result, this
form of organization appeals to entrepreneurs who enjoy working independently.
A major drawback to the sole proprietorship is unlimited liability, which
means that liabilities of the business are the entrepreneur’s responsibility, and
creditors can make claims against the entrepreneur’s personal assets if the busi-
ness fails to pay its debts. The key strengths and weaknesses of sole proprietor-
ships are summarized in Table 1.1.
Partnerships
A partnership consists of two or more owners doing business together for profit.
Partnerships account for about 7 percent of all businesses, and they are typically
larger than sole proprietorships. Partnerships are common in the finance, insur-
ance, and real estate industries. Public accounting and law partnerships often
have large numbers of partners.
Most partnerships are established by a written contract known as articles of
partnership. In a general (or regular) partnership, all partners have unlimited lia-
bility, and each partner is legally liable for all of the debts of the partnership.
Table 1.1 summarizes the strengths and weaknesses of partnerships.

lthough there are vastly more sole proprietorships than there are partnerships and corpo-
rations combined, they generate the lowest level of receipts. In total, sole proprietorships 
generated more than $969 billion in receipts, but this number hardly compares to the more than
$17 trillion in receipts generated by corporations.

Corporations
A corporation is an entity created by law. A corporation has the legal powers of
an individual in that it can sue and be sued, make and be party to contracts, and
acquire property in its own name. Although only about 20 percent of all U.S.
businesses are incorporated, the largest businesses nearly always are; corpora-
tions account for nearly 90 percent of total business revenues. Although corpora-
tions engage in all types of businesses, manufacturing firms account for the
largest portion of corporate business receipts and net profits. Table 1.1 lists the
key strengths and weaknesses of corporations.
The owners of a corporation are its stockholders, whose ownership, or
equity, takes the form of either common stock or preferred stock. Unlike the
owners of sole proprietorships or partnerships, stockholders of a corporation
enjoy limited liability, meaning that they are not personally liable for the firm’s
debts. Their losses are limited to the amount they invested in the firm when they
purchased shares of stock. In Chapter 7 you will learn more about common and
preferred stock, but for now it is enough to say that common stock is the purest
and most basic form of corporate ownership. Stockholders expect to earn a

return by receiving dividends—periodic distributions of cash—or by realizing
gains through increases in share price. Because the money to pay dividends gen-
erally comes from the profits that a firm earns, stockholders are sometimes
referred to as residual claimants, meaning that stockholders are paid last—after
employees, suppliers, tax authorities, and lenders receive what they are owed. If
the firm does not generate enough cash to pay everyone else, there is nothing
available for stockholders.
As noted in the upper portion of Figure 1.1, control of the corporation func-
tions a little like a democracy. The stockholders (owners) vote periodically to
elect members of the board of directors and to decide other issues such as
amending the corporate charter. The board of directors is typically responsible
for approving strategic goals and plans, setting general policy, guiding corporate
affairs, and approving major expenditures. Most importantly, the board decides
when to hire or fire top managers and establishes compensation packages for the
most senior executives. The board consists of “inside” directors, such as key cor-
porate executives, and “outside” or “independent” directors, such as executives
from other companies, major shareholders, and national or community leaders.
Outside directors for major corporations receive compensation in the form of
cash, stock, and stock options. This compensation often totals $100,000 per year
or more.

tion and some of the issues surrounding it will be addressed in the discussion of
the agency issue later in this chapter.
Other Limited Liability Organizations
A number of other organizational forms provide owners with limited liability.
The most popular are limited partnership (LP), S corporation (S corp), limited lia-
bility company (LLC), and limited liability partnership (LLP). Each represents a
specialized form or blending of the characteristics of the organizational forms
described previously. What they have in common is that their owners enjoy lim-
ited liability, and they typically have fewer than 100 owners.
WHY STUDY MANAGERIAL FINANCE?
An understanding of the concepts, techniques, and practices presented
throughout this text will fully acquaint you with the financial manager’s activities
and decisions. Because the consequences of most business decisions are measured
in financial terms, the financial manager plays a key operational role. People in
all areas of responsibility—accounting, information systems, management, mar-
keting, operations, and so forth—need a basic awareness of finance so they will
understand how to quantify the consequences of their actions.
OK, so you’re not planning to major in finance! You still will need to under-
stand how financial managers think to improve your chance of success in your
chosen business career. Managers in the firm, regardless of their job descriptions,
usually have to provide financial justification for the resources they need to do
their job. Whether you are hiring new workers, negotiating an advertising
budget, or upgrading the technology used in a manufacturing process, under-
standing the financial aspects of your actions will help you gain the resources you
need to be successful. The “Why This Chapter Matters to You” section that appears
on each chapter opening page should help you understand the importance of
each chapter in both your professional and personal life.
As you study this text, you will learn about the career opportunities in man-
agerial finance, which are briefly described in Table 1.2 on page 10. Although this
text focuses on publicly held profit-seeking firms, the principles presented here are
equally applicable to private and not-for-profit organizations. The decision-
making principles developed in this text can also be applied to personal financial
decisions. We hope that this first exposure to the exciting field of finance will pro-
vide the foundation and initiative for further study and possibly even a future
career.

TABLE 1.2
1.2 Goal of the Firm
What goal should managers pursue? There is no shortage of possible answers to
this question. Some might argue that managers should focus entirely on satisfying
customers. Progress toward this goal could be measured by the market share
attained by each of the firm’s products. Others suggest that managers must first
inspire and motivate employees; in that case, employee turnover might be the key
success metric to watch. Clearly the goal that managers select will affect many of
the decisions that they make, so choosing an objective is a critical determinant of
how businesses operate.
MAXIMIZE SHAREHOLDER WEALTH
Finance teaches that managers’ primary goal should be to maximize the wealth of
the firm’s owners—the stockholders. The simplest and best measure of stock-
holder wealth is the firm’s share price, so most textbooks (ours included) instruct
LG 3

managers to take actions that increase the firm’s share price. A common miscon-
ception is that when firms strive to make their shareholders happy, they do so at
the expense of other constituencies such as customers, employees, or suppliers.
This line of thinking ignores the fact that in most cases, to enrich shareholders,
managers must first satisfy the demands of these other interest groups. Recall that
dividends that stockholders receive ultimately come from the firm’s profits. It is
unlikely that a firm whose customers are unhappy with its products, whose
employees are looking for jobs at other firms, or whose suppliers are reluctant to
ship raw materials will make shareholders rich because such a firm will likely be
less profitable in the long run than one that better manages its relations with
these stakeholder groups.
Therefore, we argue that the goal of the firm, and also of managers, should
be to maximize the wealth of the owners for whom it is being operated, or
equivalently, to maximize the stock price. This goal translates into a straightfor-
ward decision rule for managers—only take actions that are expected to increase
the share price. Although that goal sounds simple, implementing it is not always
easy. To determine whether a particular course of action will increase or decrease
a firm’s share price, managers have to assess what return (that is, cash inflows net
of cash outflows) the action will bring and how risky that return might be.
Figure 1.2 depicts this process. In fact, we can say that the key variables that
managers must consider when making business decisions are return (cash flows)
and risk.
MAXIMIZE PROFIT?
It might seem intuitive that maximizing a firm’s share price is equivalent to max-
imizing its profits, but that is not always correct.
Corporations commonly measure profits in terms of earnings per share
(EPS), which represent the amount earned during the period on behalf of each
outstanding share of common stock. EPS are calculated by dividing the period’s
total earnings available for the firm’s common stockholders by the number of
shares of common stock outstanding.

Nick Dukakis, the financial manager of Neptune Manufacturing, a producer of
marine engine components, is choosing between two investments, Rotor and
Valve. The following table shows the EPS that each investment is expected to
have over its 3-year life.
In terms of the profit maximization goal, Valve would be preferred over
Rotor because it results in higher total earnings per share over the 3-year period
($3.00 EPS compared with $2.80 EPS).
But does profit maximization lead to the highest possible share price? For at
least three reasons the answer is often no. First, timing is important. An invest-
ment that provides a lower profit in the short run may be preferable to one that
earns a higher profit in the long run. Second, profits and cash flows are not iden-
tical. The profit that a firm reports is simply an estimate of how it is doing, an
estimate that is influenced by many different accounting choices that firms make
when assembling their financial reports. Cash flow is a more straightforward
measure of the money flowing into and out of the company. Companies have to
pay their bills with cash, not earnings, so cash flow is what matters most to finan-
cial managers. Third, risk matters a great deal. A firm that earns a low but reli-
able profit might be more valuable than another firm with profits that fluctuate a
great deal (and therefore can be very high or very low at different times).
Timing
Because the firm can earn a return on funds it receives, the receipt of funds sooner
rather than later is preferred. In our example, in spite of the fact that the total
earnings from Rotor are smaller than those from Valve, Rotor provides much
greater earnings per share in the first year. The larger returns in year 1 could be
reinvested to provide greater future earnings.
Cash Flows
Profits do not necessarily result in cash flows available to the stockholders. There
is no guarantee that the board of directors will increase dividends when profits
increase. In addition, the accounting assumptions and techniques that a firm
adopts can sometimes allow a firm to show a positive profit even when its cash
outflows exceed its cash inflows.
Furthermore, higher earnings do not necessarily translate into a higher stock
price. Only when earnings increases are accompanied by increased future cash
flows is a higher stock price expected. For example, a firm with a high-quality
product sold in a very competitive market could increase its earnings by signifi-
cantly reducing its equipment maintenance expenditures. The firm’s expenses
would be reduced, thereby increasing its profits. But if the reduced maintenance

results in lower product quality, the firm may impair its competitive position, and
its stock price could drop as many well-informed investors sell the stock in antic-
ipation of lower future cash flows. In this case, the earnings increase was accom-
panied by lower future cash flows and therefore a lower stock price.
Risk
Profit maximization also fails to account for risk—the chance that actual out-
comes may differ from those expected. A basic premise in managerial finance is
that a trade-off exists between return (cash flow) and risk. Return and risk are, in
fact, the key determinants of share price, which represents the wealth of the
owners in the firm.
Cash flow and risk affect share price differently: Holding risk fixed, higher
cash flow is generally associated with a higher share price. In contrast, holding cash
flow fixed, higher risk tends to result in a lower share price because the stock-
holders do not like risk. For example, Apple’s CEO, Steve Jobs, took a leave of
absence to battle a serious health issue, and the firm’s stock suffered as a result.
This occurred not because of any near-term cash flow reduction but in response to
the firm’s increased risk—there’s a chance that the firm’s lack of near-term leader-
ship could result in reduced future cash flows. Simply put, the increased risk
reduced the firm’s share price. In general, stockholders are risk averse—that is, they
must be compensated for bearing risk. In other words, investors expect to earn
higher returns on riskier investments, and they will accept lower returns on rela-
tively safe investments. The key point, which will be fully developed in Chapter 5,
is that differences in risk can significantly affect the value of different investments.
WHAT ABOUT STAKEHOLDERS?
Although maximization of shareholder wealth is the primary goal, many firms
broaden their focus to include the interests of stakeholders as well as share-
holders. Stakeholders are groups such as employees, customers, suppliers, credi-
tors, owners, and others who have a direct economic link to the firm. A firm
with a stakeholder focus consciously avoids actions that would prove detri-
mental to stakeholders. The goal is not to maximize stakeholder well-being but
to preserve it.
The stakeholder view does not alter the goal of maximizing shareholder
wealth. Such a view is often considered part of the firm’s “social responsibility.”
It is expected to provide long-run benefit to shareholders by maintaining positive
relationships with stakeholders. Such relationships should minimize stakeholder
turnover, conflicts, and litigation. Clearly, the firm can better achieve its goal of
shareholder wealth maximization by fostering cooperation with its other stake-
holders, rather than conflict with them.
THE ROLE OF BUSINESS ETHICS
Business ethics are the standards of conduct or moral judgment that apply to per-
sons engaged in commerce. Violations of these standards in finance involve a
variety of actions: “creative accounting,” earnings management, misleading
financial forecasts, insider trading, fraud, excessive executive compensation,
options backdating, bribery, and kickbacks. The financial press has reported
many such violations in recent years, involving such well-known companies as

Apple and Bank of America. As a result, the financial community is developing
and enforcing ethical standards. The goal of these ethical standards is to motivate
business and market participants to adhere to both the letter and the spirit of
laws and regulations concerned with business and professional practice. Most
business leaders believe businesses actually strengthen their competitive positions
by maintaining high ethical standards.
Considering Ethics
Robert A. Cooke, a noted ethicist, suggests that the following questions be used
to assess the ethical viability of a proposed action.1
1. Is the action arbitrary or capricious? Does it unfairly single out an individual
or group?
2. Does the action violate the moral or legal rights of any individual or
group?
3. Does the action conform to accepted moral standards?
4. Are there alternative courses of action that are less likely to cause actual or
potential harm?
Clearly, considering such questions before taking an action can help to ensure its
ethical viability.
Today, many firms are addressing the issue of ethics by establishing corpo-
rate ethics policies. The Focus on Ethics box provides an example of ethics poli-
cies at Google. A major impetus toward the development of ethics policies has
been the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Frequently, employees are required to sign
a formal pledge to uphold the firm’s ethics policies. Such policies typically apply
to employee actions in dealing with all corporate stakeholders, including the
public.
Ethics and Share Price
An effective ethics program can enhance corporate value by producing a number
of positive benefits. It can reduce potential litigation and judgment costs, main-
tain a positive corporate image, build shareholder confidence, and gain the loy-
alty, commitment, and respect of the firm’s stakeholders. Such actions, by
maintaining and enhancing cash flow and reducing perceived risk, can positively
affect the firm’s share price. Ethical behavior is therefore viewed as necessary for
achieving the firm’s goal of owner wealth maximization.

focus on ETHICS
Will Google Live Up to Its Motto?
Google offers an inter-
esting case study on
value maximization and corporate
ethics. In 2004, Google’s founders pro-
vided “An Owner’s Manual” for share-
holders, which stated that “Google is
not a conventional company” and that
the company’s ultimate goal “is to
develop services that significantly
improve the lives of as many people as
possible.” The founders stressed that it
was not enough for Google to run a
successful business but that they want to
use the company to make the world a
better place. The “Owner’s Manual”
also unveiled Google’s corporate
motto, “Don’t Be Evil.” The motto is
intended to convey Google’s willing-
ness to do the right thing even when
doing so requires the firm to sacrifice in
the short run. Google’s approach does
not appear to be limiting its ability to
maximize value—the company’s share
price increased from $100 to approxi-
mately $500 in 6 years.
in practice
Google’s business goal is “instantly
delivering relevant information on any
topic” to the world. However, when the
company launched its search engine in
China in early 2006, it agreed to the
Chinese government’s request to censor
search results. Some observers felt that
the opportunity to gain access to the
vast Chinese market led Google to
compromise its principles.
In January 2010, Google
announced that the Gmail accounts of
Chinese human-rights activists and a
number of technology, financial, and
defense companies had been hacked.
The company threatened to pull out of
China unless an agreement on uncen-
sored search results could be reached.
Two months later, Google began rout-
ing Chinese web searches to their
uncensored servers in Hong Kong, a
move that was cheered by activists and
human-rights groups, but criticized by
the Chinese government. In the short
term, Google’s shareholders suffered.
During the first quarter of 2010,
Google’s share price declined by 8.5
percent, compared to an increase of
45.2 percent for Google’s main rival in
China, Baidu.com.
Google’s founders seemed to antici-
pate the current situation in the firm’s
“Owner’s Manual.” According to the
firm, “If opportunities arise that might
cause us to sacrifice short-term results
but are in the best long-term interest of
our shareholders, we will take those
opportunities. We have the fortitude to
do this. We would request that our
shareholders take the long-term view.” 
It remains to be seen whether Google’s
short-term sacrifice will benefit share-
holders in the long run.

shareholder wealth necessarily 
ethical or unethical?

in the short run to its long-run
investors?

1.3 Managerial Finance Function
People in all areas of responsibility within the firm must interact with finance per-
sonnel and procedures to get their jobs done. For financial personnel to make
useful forecasts and decisions, they must be willing and able to talk to individuals
in other areas of the firm. For example, when considering a new product, the
financial manager needs to obtain sales forecasts, pricing guidelines, and adver-
tising and promotion budget estimates from marketing personnel. The manage-
rial finance function can be broadly described by considering its role within the
LG 5
LG 4

organization, its relationship to economics and accounting, and the primary
activities of the financial manager.
ORGANIZATION OF THE FINANCE FUNCTION
The size and importance of the managerial finance function depend on the size of
the firm. In small firms, the finance function is generally performed by the
accounting department. As a firm grows, the finance function typically evolves
into a separate department linked directly to the company president or CEO
through the chief financial officer (CFO). The lower portion of the organizational
chart in Figure 1.1 on page 8 shows the structure of the finance function in a typ-
ical medium- to large-size firm.
Reporting to the CFO are the treasurer and the controller. The treasurer (the
chief financial manager) typically manages the firm’s cash, investing surplus
funds when available and securing outside financing when needed. The treasurer
also oversees a firm’s pension plans and manages critical risks related to move-
ments in foreign currency values, interest rates, and commodity prices. The
controller (the chief accountant) typically handles the accounting activities, such as
corporate accounting, tax management, financial accounting, and cost accounting.
The treasurer’s focus tends to be more external, whereas the controller’s focus is
more internal.
If international sales or purchases are important to a firm, it may well
employ one or more finance professionals whose job is to monitor and manage
the firm’s exposure to loss from currency fluctuations. A trained financial man-
ager can “hedge,” or protect against such a loss, at a reasonable cost by using a
variety of financial instruments. These foreign exchange managers typically
report to the firm’s treasurer.
RELATIONSHIP TO ECONOMICS
The field of finance is closely related to economics. Financial managers must
understand the economic framework and be alert to the consequences of varying
levels of economic activity and changes in economic policy. They must also be
able to use economic theories as guidelines for efficient business operation.
Examples include supply-and-demand analysis, profit-maximizing strategies, and
price theory. The primary economic principle used in managerial finance is
marginal cost–benefit analysis, the principle that financial decisions should be
made and actions taken only when the added benefits exceed the added costs.
Nearly all financial decisions ultimately come down to an assessment of their
marginal benefits and marginal costs.
Jamie Teng is a financial manager for Nord Department Stores, a large chain of
upscale department stores operating primarily in the western United States. She is
currently trying to decide whether to replace one of the firm’s computer servers
with a new, more sophisticated one that would both speed processing and handle
a larger volume of transactions. The new computer would require a cash outlay
of $8,000, and the old computer could be sold to net $2,000. The total benefits
from the new server (measured in today’s dollars) would be $10,000. The bene-
fits over a similar time period from the old computer (measured in today’s

Because the marginal (added) benefits of $7,000 exceed the marginal (added)
costs of $6,000, Jamie recommends that the firm purchase the new computer to
replace the old one. The firm will experience a net benefit of $1,000 as a result of
this action.
RELATIONSHIP TO ACCOUNTING
The firm’s finance and accounting activities are closely related and generally
overlap. In small firms accountants often carry out the finance function, and in
large firms financial analysts often help compile accounting information.
However, there are two basic differences between finance and accounting; one is
related to the emphasis on cash flows and the other to decision making.
Emphasis on Cash Flows
The accountant’s primary function is to develop and report data for measuring
the performance of the firm, assess its financial position, comply with and file
reports required by securities regulators, and file and pay taxes. Using generally
accepted accounting principles, the accountant prepares financial statements that
recognize revenue at the time of sale (whether payment has been received or not)
and recognize expenses when they are incurred. This approach is referred to as
the accrual basis.
The financial manager, on the other hand, places primary emphasis on cash
flows, the intake and outgo of cash. He or she maintains the firm’s solvency by
planning the cash flows necessary to satisfy its obligations and to acquire assets
needed to achieve the firm’s goals. The financial manager uses this cash basis to
recognize the revenues and expenses only with respect to actual inflows and out-
flows of cash. Whether a firm earns a profit or experiences a loss, it must have a
sufficient flow of cash to meet its obligations as they come due.
Nassau Corporation, a small yacht dealer, sold one yacht for $100,000 in the cal-
endar year just ended. Nassau originally purchased the yacht for $80,000.
Although the firm paid in full for the yacht during the year, at year-end it has yet
to collect the $100,000 from the customer. The accounting view and the financial

view of the firm’s performance during the year are given by the following income
and cash flow statements, respectively.
In an accounting sense, Nassau Corporation is profitable, but in terms of actual
cash flow it is a financial failure. Its lack of cash flow resulted from the uncol-
lected accounts receivable of $100,000. Without adequate cash inflows to meet
its obligations, the firm will not survive, regardless of its level of profits.
As the example shows, accrual accounting data do not fully describe the cir-
cumstances of a firm. Thus the financial manager must look beyond financial
statements to obtain insight into existing or developing problems. Of course,
accountants are well aware of the importance of cash flows, and financial man-
agers use and understand accrual-based financial statements. Nevertheless, the
financial manager, by concentrating on cash flows, should be able to avoid insol-
vency and achieve the firm’s financial goals.
Individuals do not use accrual concepts. Rather, they rely solely
on cash flows to measure their financial outcomes. Generally,
individuals plan, monitor, and assess their financial activities using cash flows
over a given period, typically a month or a year. Ann Bach projects her cash flows
during October 2012 as follows:

Ann subtracts her total outflows of $4,835 from her total inflows of $4,620
and finds that her net cash flow for October will be –$215. To cover the $215

shortfall, Ann will have to either borrow $215 (putting it on a credit card is a
form of borrowing) or withdraw $215 from her savings. Or she may decide to
reduce her outflows in areas of discretionary spending—for example, clothing
purchases, dining out, or areas that make up the $425 of miscellaneous expense.
Decision Making
The second major difference between finance and accounting has to do with deci-
sion making. Accountants devote most of their attention to the collection and
presentation of financial data. Financial managers evaluate the accounting state-
ments, develop additional data, and make decisions on the basis of their assess-
ment of the associated returns and risks. Of course, this does not mean that
accountants never make decisions or that financial managers never gather data but
rather that the primary focuses of accounting and finance are distinctly different.
PRIMARY ACTIVITIES OF THE FINANCIAL MANAGER
In addition to ongoing involvement in financial analysis and planning, the finan-
cial manager’s primary activities are making investment and financing decisions.
Investment decisions determine what types of assets the firm holds. Financing
decisions determine how the firm raises money to pay for the assets in which it
invests. One way to visualize the difference between a firm’s investment and
financing decisions is to refer to the balance sheet shown in Figure 1.3. Investment
decisions generally refer to the items that appear on the left-hand side of the bal-
ance sheet, and financing decisions relate to the items on the right-hand side.
Keep in mind, though, that financial managers make these decisions based on
their impact on the value of the firm, not on the accounting principles used to
construct a balance sheet.

Introduction to Managerial Finance
1.4 Governance and Agency
As noted earlier, the majority of owners of a corporation are normally distinct
from its managers. Nevertheless, managers are entrusted to only take actions or
make decisions that are in the best interests of the firm’s owners, its shareholders.
In most cases, if managers fail to act on the behalf of the shareholders, they will
also fail to achieve the goal of maximizing shareholder wealth. To help ensure
that managers act in ways that are consistent with the interests of shareholders
and mindful of obligations to other stakeholders, firms aim to establish sound
corporate governance practices.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Corporate governance refers to the rules, processes, and laws by which compa-
nies are operated, controlled, and regulated. It defines the rights and responsibil-
ities of the corporate participants such as the shareholders, board of directors,
officers and managers, and other stakeholders, as well as the rules and proce-
dures for making corporate decisions. A well-defined corporate governance struc-
ture is intended to benefit all corporate stakeholders by ensuring that the firm is
run in a lawful and ethical fashion, in accordance with best practices, and subject
to all corporate regulations.
A firm’s corporate governance is influenced by both internal factors such as
the shareholders, board of directors, and officers as well as external forces such
as clients, creditors, suppliers, competitors, and government regulations. The cor-
porate organization, depicted in Figure 1.1 on page 8, helps to shape a firm’s cor-
porate governance structure. In particular, the stockholders elect a board of
directors, who in turn hire officers or managers to operate the firm in a manner
consistent with the goals, plans, and policies established and monitored by the
board on behalf of the shareholders.
Individual versus Institutional Investors
To better understand the role that shareholders play in shaping a firm’s corporate
governance, it is helpful to differentiate between the two broad classes of
owners—individuals and institutions. Generally, individual investors own rela-
tively small quantities of shares and as a result do not typically have sufficient
means to directly influence a firm’s corporate governance. In order to influence the
firm, individual investors often find it necessary to act as a group by voting collec-
tively on corporate matters. The most important corporate matter individual
investors vote on is the election of the firm’s board of directors. The corporate
board’s first responsibility is to the shareholders. The board not only sets policies
that specify ethical practices and provide for the protection of stakeholder inter-
ests, but it also monitors managerial decision making on behalf of investors.
Although they also benefit from the presence of the board of directors, insti-
tutional investors have advantages over individual investors when it comes to
influencing the corporate governance of a firm. Institutional investors are invest-
ment professionals that are paid to manage and hold large quantities of securities
on behalf of individuals, businesses, and governments. Institutional investors
include banks, insurance companies, mutual funds, and pension funds. Unlike
individual investors, institutional investors often monitor and directly influence a

firm’s corporate governance by exerting pressure on management to perform or
communicating their concerns to the firm’s board. These large investors can also
threaten to exercise their voting rights or liquidate their holdings if the board
does not respond positively to their concerns. Because individual and institu-
tional investors share the same goal, individual investors benefit from the share-
holder activism of institutional investors.
Government Regulation
Unlike the impact that clients, creditors, suppliers, or competitors can have on a
particular firm’s corporate governance, government regulation generally shapes
the corporate governance of all firms. During the past decade, corporate gover-
nance has received increased attention due to several high-profile corporate scan-
dals involving abuse of corporate power and, in some cases, alleged criminal
activity by corporate officers. The misdeeds derived from two main types of
issues: (1) false disclosures in financial reporting and other material information
releases and (2) undisclosed conflicts of interest between corporations and their
analysts, auditors, and attorneys and between corporate directors, officers, and
shareholders. Asserting that an integral part of an effective corporate governance
regime is provisions for civil or criminal prosecution of individuals who conduct
unethical or illegal acts in the name of the firm, in July 2002 the U.S. Congress
passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (commonly called SOX).
Sarbanes-Oxley is intended to eliminate many of the disclosure and conflict
of interest problems that can arise when corporate managers are not held person-
ally accountable for their firm’s financial decisions and disclosures. SOX accom-
plished the following: established an oversight board to monitor the accounting
industry; tightened audit regulations and controls; toughened penalties against
executives who commit corporate fraud; strengthened accounting disclosure
requirements and ethical guidelines for corporate officers; established corporate
board structure and membership guidelines; established guidelines with regard to
analyst conflicts of interest; mandated instant disclosure of stock sales by corpo-
rate executives; and increased securities regulation authority and budgets for
auditors and investigators.
THE AGENCY ISSUE
We know that the duty of the financial manager is to maximize the wealth of the
firm’s owners. Shareholders give managers decision-making authority over the
firm; thus managers can be viewed as the agents of the firm’s shareholders.
Technically, any manager who owns less than 100 percent of the firm is an agent
acting on behalf of other owners. This separation of owners and managers is
shown by the dashed horizontal line in Figure 1.1 on page 8, and it is representa-
tive of the classic principal–agent relationship, where the shareholders are the
principals. In general, a contract is used to specify the terms of a principal–agent
relationship. This arrangement works well when the agent makes decisions that
are in the principal’s best interest but doesn’t work well when the interests of the
principal and agent differ.
In theory, most financial managers would agree with the goal of share-
holder wealth maximization. In reality, however, managers are also concerned
with their personal wealth, job security, and fringe benefits. Such concerns may
cause managers to make decisions that are not consistent with shareholder

wealth maximization. For example, financial managers may be reluctant or
unwilling to take more than moderate risk if they perceive that taking too much
risk might jeopardize their job or reduce their personal wealth.
The Agency Problem
An important theme of corporate governance is to ensure the accountability of
managers in an organization through mechanisms that try to reduce or eliminate
the principal–agent problem; however, when these mechanisms fail agency prob-
lems arise. Agency problems arise when managers deviate from the goal of maxi-
mization of shareholder wealth by placing their personal goals ahead of the goals
of shareholders. These problems in turn give rise to agency costs. Agency costs are
costs borne by shareholders due to the presence or avoidance of agency problems,
and in either case represent a loss of shareholder wealth. For example, share-
holders incur agency costs when managers fail to make the best investment deci-
sion or when managers have to be monitored to ensure that the best investment
decision is made, because either situation is likely to result in a lower stock 
price.
Management Compensation Plans
In addition to the roles played by corporate boards, institutional investors, and
government regulations, corporate governance can be strengthened by ensuring
that managers’ interests are aligned with those of shareholders. A common
approach is to structure management compensation to correspond with firm per-
formance. In addition to combating agency problems, the resulting performance-
based compensation packages allow firms to compete for and hire the best
managers available. The two key types of managerial compensation plans are
incentive plans and performance plans.
Incentive plans tie management compensation to share price. One incentive
plan grants stock options to management. If the firm’s stock price rises over time,
managers will be rewarded by being able to purchase stock at the market price in
effect at the time of the grant and then to resell the shares at the prevailing higher
market price.
Many firms also offer performance plans that tie management compensation
to performance measures such as earnings per share (EPS) or growth in EPS.
Compensation under these plans is often in the form of performance shares or
cash bonuses. Performance shares are shares of stock given to management as a
result of meeting the stated performance goals, whereas cash bonuses are cash
payments tied to the achievement of certain performance goals.
The execution of many compensation plans has been closely scrutinized in
light of the past decade’s corporate scandals and financial woes. Both individual
and institutional stockholders, as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) and other government entities, continue to publicly question the appropri-
ateness of the multimillion-dollar compensation packages that many corporate
executives receive. The total compensation in 2009 for the chief executive officers
of the 500 biggest U.S. companies is considerable. For example, the three highest-
paid CEOs in 2009 were (1) H. Lawrence Culp Jr. of Danaher Corp., who earned
$141.36 million; (2) Lawrence J. Ellison of Oracle Corp., who earned $130.23
million; and (3) Aubrey K. McClendon of Chesapeake Energy Corp., who earned

Most studies have failed to find a strong relationship between the perform-
ance that companies achieve and the compensation that CEOs receive. During
the past few years, publicity surrounding these large compensation packages
(without corresponding performance) has driven down executive compensation.
Contributing to this publicity is the SEC requirement that publicly traded compa-
nies disclose to shareholders and others the amount of compensation to their
CEO, CFO, three other highest-paid executives, and directors; the method used
to determine it; and a narrative discussion regarding the underlying compensation
policies. At the same time, new compensation plans that better link managers’ per-
formance to their compensation are being developed and implemented. As evi-
dence of this trend, consider that the average total compensation for the top three
CEOs in 2009 was down slightly more than 69 percent from the average for the
top three CEOs in 2006. The average in 2006 was $421.13 million versus an
average of $128.63 million in 2009.
The Threat of Takeover
When a firm’s internal corporate governance structure is unable to keep agency
problems in check, it is likely that rival managers will try to gain control of the
firm. Because agency problems represent a misuse of the firm’s resources and
impose agency costs on the firm’s shareholders, the firm’s stock is generally
depressed, making the firm an attractive takeover target. The threat of takeover
by another firm that believes it can enhance the troubled firm’s value by restruc-
turing its management, operations, and financing can provide a strong source of
external corporate governance. The constant threat of a takeover tends to moti-
vate management to act in the best interests of the firm’s owners.

forming CEOs is less than 4 percent of the total compensation for the top-paid CEOs, all

Introduction to Managerial Finance
Summary
FOCUS ON VALUE
Chapter 1 established the primary goal of the firm—to maximize the wealth of
the owners for whom the firm is being operated. For public companies, value 
at any time is reflected in the stock price. Therefore, management should act
only on those opportunities that are expected to create value for owners by
increasing the stock price. Doing this requires management to consider the
returns (magnitude and timing of cash flows), the risk of each proposed action,
and their combined effect on value.
REVIEW OF LEARNING GOALS
Define finance and the managerial finance function. Finance is the sci-
ence and art of managing money. It affects virtually all aspects of business.
Managerial finance is concerned with the duties of the financial manager
working in a business. Financial managers administer the financial affairs of all
types of businesses—private and public, large and small, profit seeking and not
for profit. They perform such varied tasks as developing a financial plan or
budget, extending credit to customers, evaluating proposed large expenditures,
and raising money to fund the firm’s operations.
Describe the legal forms of business organization. The legal forms of
business organization are the sole proprietorship, the partnership, and the cor-
poration. The corporation is dominant in terms of business receipts, and its
owners are its common and preferred stockholders. Stockholders expect to earn
a return by receiving dividends or by realizing gains through increases in share
price.
LG 2
LG 1

Describe the goal of the firm, and explain why maximizing the value of
the firm is an appropriate goal for a business. The goal of the firm is to maxi-
mize its value and therefore the wealth of its shareholders. Maximizing the value
of the firm means running the business in the interest of those who own it—the
shareholders. Because shareholders are paid after other stakeholders, it is 
generally necessary to satisfy the interests of other stakeholders to enrich 
shareholders.
Describe how the managerial finance function is related to economics
and accounting. All areas of responsibility within a firm interact with finance
personnel and procedures. The financial manager must understand the economic
environment and rely heavily on the economic principle of marginal cost–benefit
analysis to make financial decisions. Financial managers use accounting but con-
centrate on cash flows and decision making.
Identify the primary activities of the financial manager. The primary
activities of the financial manager, in addition to ongoing involvement in finan-
cial analysis and planning, are making investment decisions and making
financing decisions.
Describe the nature of the principal–agent relationship between the
owners and managers of a corporation, and explain how various corporate gov-
ernance mechanisms attempt to manage agency problems. This separation 
of owners and managers of the typical firm is representative of the classic 
principal–agent relationship, where the shareholders are the principals and man-
agers are the agents. This arrangement works well when the agent makes deci-
sions that are in the principal’s best interest but can lead to agency problems
when the interests of the principal and agent differ. A firm’s corporate gover-
nance structure is intended to help ensure that managers act in the best interests
of the firm’s shareholders, and other stakeholders, and it is usually influenced by
both internal and external factors.

this expenditure is necessary to continue a long-running project designed to use
satellites to allow video conferencing anywhere on the planet. The manager admits
that the satellite concept has been surpassed by recent technological advances in
telephony, but he feels that AIMCO should continue the project. His reasoning is
based on the fact that $2.5 million has already been spent over the past 15 years on
this project. Although the project has little chance to be viable, the manager believes
it would be a shame to waste the money and time already spent.

employees to accept tips. Customers who once said, “Keep the change,” now have
to get used to waiting for their nickels. Management even instituted a policy of
requiring that the change be thrown out if a customer drives off without it. As a fre-
quent customer who gets coffee and doughnuts for the office, you notice that the
lines are longer and that more mistakes are being made in your order.
Explain why tips could be viewed as similar to stock options and why the delays
and incorrect orders could represent a case of agency costs. If tips are gone forever,
how could Donut Shop reduce these agency costs?

Spreadsheet Exercise
Assume that Monsanto Corporation is considering the renovation and/or replace-
ment of some of its older and outdated carpet-manufacturing equipment. Its objective
is to improve the efficiency of operations in terms of both speed and reduction in the
number of defects. The company’s finance department has compiled pertinent data
that will allow it to conduct a marginal cost–benefit analysis for the proposed equip-
ment replacement.
The cash outlay for new equipment would be approximately $600,000. The net
book value of the old equipment and its potential net selling price add up to
$250,000. The total benefits from the new equipment (measured in today’s dollars)
would be $900,000. The benefits of the old equipment over a similar period of time
(measured in today’s dollars) would be $300,000.
TO DO
Create a spreadsheet to conduct a marginal cost–benefit analysis for Monsanto
Corporation, and determine the following:
a. The marginal (added) benefits of the proposed new equipment.
b. The marginal (added) cost of the proposed new equipment.
c. The net benefit of the proposed new equipment.

Cut to the Chase
S
ince the recession of the early 1990s, business
had been booming for JPMorgan Chase, one of
the leading investment banking firms on Wall Street.
After hitting a low of roughly $2 per share in October
1990, Chase stock went on a tear, rising at a rate of
about 21 percent per year and hitting the $50 range
by April 2007. The bank’s investors enjoyed
increasing dividend payments along with the rising
stock price. JPMorgan Chase increased its dividend payout from $0.0833 per share in
December 1990 to $0.38 per share in July 2007, an increase of more than 350 percent.
Trouble was brewing, however. In the summer of 2007, data began to emerge that prices
of single-family homes were falling in many U.S. cities and homeowners were starting to default
on their mortgages. Rumors swirled that JPMorgan and other banks held large investments in
securities tied to residential mortgages. On September 15, 2008, the venerable investment
banking firm, Lehman Brothers, filed for bankruptcy, and JPMorgan shares fell 10 percent in a
single day. Bad news about the economy and the financial sector continued through the fall,
and Chase’s stock hit a low point on November 21 near $20, losing more than half its value in
roughly 18 months.
All of this prompted JPMorgan management to make two difficult decisions. The first was
to accept a $25 billion “investment” (some referred to it as a bailout) from the U.S. Treasury on
October 28, 2008. The second was to cut its quarterly dividend by almost 87 percent, from
$0.38 to $0.05 per share. These decisions, combined with a slowly improving economy,
helped JPMorgan survive the 2008 financial crisis and the subsequent recession. By the summer
of 2009, JPMorgan Chase repaid the $25 billion (with interest) that it had received from the
government, and the bank’s stock had recovered most of the value that it had lost.

PART 1
Introduction to Managerial Finance
2.1 Financial Institutions and Markets
Most successful firms have ongoing needs for funds. They can obtain funds from
external sources in three ways. The first source is through a financial institution
that accepts savings and transfers them to those that need funds. A second source
is through financial markets, organized forums in which the suppliers and
demanders of various types of funds can make transactions. A third source is
through private placement. Because of the unstructured nature of private place-
ments, here we focus primarily on the role of financial institutions and financial
markets in facilitating business financing.
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
Financial institutions serve as intermediaries by channeling the savings of individ-
uals, businesses, and governments into loans or investments. Many financial
institutions directly or indirectly pay savers interest on deposited funds; others
provide services for a fee (for example, checking accounts for which customers
pay service charges). Some financial institutions accept customers’ savings
deposits and lend this money to other customers or to firms; others invest 
customers’ savings in earning assets such as real estate or stocks and bonds; and
some do both. Financial institutions are required by the government to operate
within established regulatory guidelines.
Key Customers of Financial Institutions
For financial institutions, the key suppliers of funds and the key demanders of
funds are individuals, businesses, and governments. The savings that individual
consumers place in financial institutions provide these institutions with a large
portion of their funds. Individuals not only supply funds to financial institutions
but also demand funds from them in the form of loans. However, individuals as a
group are the net suppliers for financial institutions: They save more money than
they borrow.
Business firms also deposit some of their funds in financial institutions, pri-
marily in checking accounts with various commercial banks. Like individuals,
firms borrow funds from these institutions, but firms are net demanders of funds:
They borrow more money than they save.
Governments maintain deposits of temporarily idle funds, certain tax pay-
ments, and Social Security payments in commercial banks. They do not borrow
funds directly from financial institutions, although by selling their debt securities
to various institutions, governments indirectly borrow from them. The govern-
ment, like business firms, is typically a net demander of funds: It typically bor-
rows more than it saves. We’ve all heard about the federal budget deficit.
Major Financial Institutions
The major financial institutions in the U.S. economy are commercial banks, sav-
ings and loans, credit unions, savings banks, insurance companies, mutual funds,
and pension funds. These institutions attract funds from individuals, businesses,
and governments, combine them, and make loans available to individuals and
businesses.

COMMERCIAL BANKS, INVESTMENT BANKS, AND THE
SHADOW BANKING SYSTEM
Commercial banks are among the most important financial institutions in the
economy because they provide savers with a secure place to invest funds and they
offer both individuals and companies loans to finance investments, such as the
purchase of a new home or the expansion of a business. Investment banks are
institutions that (1) assist companies in raising capital, (2) advise firms on major
transactions such as mergers or financial restructurings, and (3) engage in trading
and market making activities.
The traditional business model of a commercial bank—taking in and paying
interest on deposits and investing or lending those funds back out at higher
interest rates—works to the extent that depositors believe that their investments
are secure. Since the 1930s, the U.S. government has given some assurance to
depositors that their money is safe by providing deposit insurance (currently up
to $250,000 per depositor). Deposit insurance was put in place in response to the
banking runs or panics that were part of the Great Depression. The same act of
Congress that introduced deposit insurance, the Glass-Steagall Act, also created a
separation between commercial banks and investment banks, meaning that an
institution engaged in taking in deposits could not also engage in the somewhat
riskier activities of securities underwriting and trading.
Commercial and investment banks remained essentially separate for more than 
50 years, but in the late 1990s Glass-Steagall was repealed. Companies that had for-
merly engaged only in the traditional activities of a commercial bank began com-
peting with investment banks for underwriting and other services. In addition, the
1990s witnessed tremendous growth in what has come to be known as the shadow
banking system. The shadow banking system describes a group of institutions that
engage in lending activities, much like traditional banks, but these institutions do
not accept deposits and are therefore not subject to the same regulations as tradi-
tional banks.1 For example, an institution such as a pension fund might have excess
cash to invest, and a large corporation might need short-term financing to cover sea-
sonal cash flow needs. A business like Lehman Brothers acted as an intermediary
between these two parties, helping to facilitate a loan, and thereby became part of
the shadow banking system. In March 2010, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner
noted that at its peak the shadow banking system financed roughly $8 trillion in
assets and was roughly as large as the traditional banking system.

cial crisis and recession of 2008–2009. This legislation will likely have a dramatic impact on the regulation of both
traditional and shadow banking institutions, but it is too early to tell exactly what the new law’s effects will be. In
the wake of the law’s passage, many commentators suggested that the law did not exercise enough oversight of the
shadow banking system to prevent a financial meltdown similar to the one that motivated the law’s enactment.

Matter of fact
T
he U.S. banking industry has been going through a long period of consolidation. According
to the FDIC, the number of commercial banks in the United States declined from 11,463 in
1992 to 8,012 at the end of 2009, a decline of 30 percent. The decline is concentrated among
small community banks, which larger institutions have been acquiring at a rapid pace.

FINANCIAL MARKETS
Financial markets are forums in which suppliers of funds and demanders of funds
can transact business directly. Whereas the loans made by financial institutions
are granted without the direct knowledge of the suppliers of funds (savers), sup-
pliers in the financial markets know where their funds are being lent or invested.
The two key financial markets are the money market and the capital market.
Transactions in short-term debt instruments, or marketable securities, take place
in the money market. Long-term securities—bonds and stocks—are traded in the
capital market.
To raise money, firms can use either private placements or public offerings. A
private placement involves the sale of a new security directly to an investor or
group of investors, such as an insurance company or pension fund. Most firms,
however, raise money through a public offering of securities, which is the sale of
either bonds or stocks to the general public.
When a company or government entity sells stocks or bonds to investors and
receives cash in return, it is said to have sold securities in the primary market. After
the primary market transaction occurs, any further trading in the security does not
involve the issuer directly, and the issuer receives no additional money from these
subsequent transactions. Once the securities begin to trade between investors, they
become part of the secondary market. On large stock exchanges, billions of shares
may trade between buyers and sellers on a single day, and these are all secondary
market transactions. Money flows from the investors buying stocks to the investors
selling them, and the company whose stock is being traded is largely unaffected by
the transactions. The primary market is the one in which “new” securities are sold.
The secondary market can be viewed as a “preowned” securities market.
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INSTITUTIONS AND MARKETS
Financial institutions actively participate in the financial markets as both sup-
pliers and demanders of funds. Figure 2.1 depicts the general flow of funds
through and between financial institutions and financial markets as well as the

mechanics of private placement transactions. Domestic or foreign individuals, busi-
nesses, and governments may supply and demand funds. We next briefly discuss the
money market, including its international equivalent—the Eurocurrency market.
We then end this section with a discussion of the capital market, which is of key
importance to the firm.
THE MONEY MARKET
The money market is created by a financial relationship between suppliers and
demanders of short-term funds (funds with maturities of one year or less). The
money market exists because some individuals, businesses, governments, and
financial institutions have temporarily idle funds that they wish to invest in a rel-
atively safe, interest-bearing asset. At the same time, other individuals, busi-
nesses, governments, and financial institutions find themselves in need of
seasonal or temporary financing. The money market brings together these sup-
pliers and demanders of short-term funds.
Most money market transactions are made in marketable securities—
short-term debt instruments, such as U.S. Treasury bills, commercial paper, and
negotiable certificates of deposit issued by government, business, and financial
institutions, respectively. Investors generally consider marketable securities to be
among the least risky investments available. Marketable securities are described
in Chapter 15.
The international equivalent of the domestic money market is called the
Eurocurrency market. This is a market for short-term bank deposits denominated
in U.S. dollars or other major currencies. Eurocurrency deposits arise when a cor-
poration or individual makes a bank deposit in a currency other than the local
currency of the country where the bank is located. If, for example, a multina-
tional corporation were to deposit U.S. dollars in a London bank, this would
create a Eurodollar deposit (a dollar deposit at a bank in Europe). Nearly all
Eurodollar deposits are time deposits. This means that the bank would promise
to repay the deposit, with interest, at a fixed date in the future—say, in 6 months.
During the interim, the bank is free to lend this dollar deposit to creditworthy
corporate or government borrowers. If the bank cannot find a borrower on its
own, it may lend the deposit to another international bank.
THE CAPITAL MARKET
The capital market is a market that enables suppliers and demanders of long-term
funds to make transactions. Included are securities issues of business and govern-
ment. The backbone of the capital market is formed by the broker and dealer
markets that provide a forum for bond and stock transactions. International cap-
ital markets also exist.
Key Securities Traded: Bonds and Stocks
The key capital market securities are bonds (long-term debt) and both common
stock and preferred stock (equity, or ownership).
Bonds are long-term debt instruments used by business and government to
raise large sums of money, generally from a diverse group of lenders. Corporate
bonds typically pay interest semiannually (every 6 months) at a stated coupon
interest rate. They have an initial maturity of from 10 to 30 years, and a par, or

face, value of $l,000 that must be repaid at maturity. Bonds are described in
detail in Chapter 7.
Lakeview Industries, a major microprocessor manufacturer, has issued a 9%
coupon interest rate, 20-year bond with a $1,000 par value that pays interest
semiannually. Investors who buy this bond receive the contractual right to $90
annual interest (9% coupon interest rate
par value) distributed as $45
at the end of each 6 months 
for 20 years, plus the $1,000 par value
at the end of year 20.
As noted earlier, shares of common stock are units of ownership, or equity, in
a corporation. Common stockholders earn a return by receiving dividends—
periodic distributions of cash—or by realizing increases in share price. Preferred
stock is a special form of ownership that has features of both a bond and
common stock. Preferred stockholders are promised a fixed periodic dividend
that must be paid prior to payment of any dividends to common stockholders. In
other words, preferred stock has “preference” over common stock. Preferred
stock and common stock are described in detail in Chapter 8. See the Focus on
Practice box for the story of one legendary stock price and the equally legendary
man who brought it about.
Broker Markets and Dealer Markets
By far the vast majority of trades made by individual investors take place in the
secondary market. When you look at the secondary market on the basis of how
securities are traded, you will find you can essentially divide the market into two
segments: broker markets and dealer markets.
The key difference between broker and dealer markets is a technical point
dealing with the way trades are executed. That is, when a trade occurs in a broker
market, the two sides to the transaction, the buyer and the seller, are brought
together and the trade takes place at that point: Party A sells his or her securities
directly to the buyer, Party B. In a sense, with the help of a broker, the securities
effectively change hands on the floor of the exchange. The broker market consists
of national and regional securities exchanges, which are organizations that pro-
vide a marketplace in which firms can raise funds through the sale of new securi-
ties and purchasers can resell securities.
In contrast, when trades are made in a dealer market, the buyer and the seller
are never brought together directly. Instead, market makers execute the buy/sell
orders. Market makers are securities dealers who “make markets” by offering to
buy or sell certain securities at stated prices. Essentially, two separate trades are
made: Party A sells his or her securities (in, say, Dell) to a dealer, and Party B buys
his or her securities (in Dell) from another, or possibly even the same, dealer.
Thus, there is always a dealer (market maker) on one side of a dealer–market
transaction. The dealer market is made up of both the Nasdaq market, an all-
electronic trading platform used to execute securities trades, and the over-
the-counter (OTC) market, where smaller, unlisted securities are traded.
Broker Markets
If you are like most people, when you think of the “stock
market” the first name to come to mind is the New York Stock Exchange, known
currently as the NYSE Euronext after a series of mergers that expanded the

Berkshire Hathaway—Can Buffett Be Replaced?
In early 1980,
investors could buy
one share of Berkshire Hathaway Class
A common stock (stock symbol: BRKA)
for $285. That may have seemed
expensive at the time, but by September
2010 the price of just one share had
climbed to $125,000. The wizard
behind such phenomenal growth in
shareholder value is the chairman of
Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett,
nicknamed the Oracle of Omaha.
With his partner, Vice-Chairman
Charlie Munger, Buffett runs a large
conglomerate of dozens of subsidiaries
with 222,000 employees and more
than $112 billion in annual revenues.
He makes it look easy. In his words,
“I’ve taken the easy route, just sitting
back and working through great man-
agers who run their own shows. My
only tasks are to cheer them on, sculpt
and harden our corporate culture, and
make major capital-allocation deci-
sions. Our managers have returned this
trust by working hard and effectively.”a
in practice
Buffett’s style of corporate leader-
ship seems rather laid back, but behind
that “aw-shucks” manner is one of the
best analytical minds in business. He
believes in aligning managerial incen-
tives with performance. Berkshire
employs many different incentive
arrangements, with their terms depend-
ing on such elements as the economic
potential or capital intensity of a CEO’s
business. Whatever the compensation
arrangement, Buffett tries to keep it both
simple and fair. Buffett himself receives
an annual salary of $100,000—not
much in this age of supersized CEO
compensation packages. Listed for
many years among the world’s wealthi-
est people, Buffett has donated most of
his Berkshire stock to the Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation.
Berkshire’s annual report is a must-
read for many investors due to the pop-
ularity of Buffett’s annual letter to
shareholders with his homespun take on
such topics as investing, corporate gov-
ernance, and corporate leadership.
Shareholder meetings in Omaha,
Nebraska, have turned into cultlike
gatherings, with thousands traveling to
listen to Buffett answer questions from
shareholders. One question that has
been firmly answered is the question 
of Mr. Buffett’s ability to create share-
holder value.
The next question that needs to 
be answered is whether Berkshire
Hathaway can successfully replace
Buffett (age 80) and Munger (age 86).
In October 2010, Berkshire hired
hedge fund manager Todd Combs to
handle a significant portion of the firm’s
investments. Berkshire shareholders
hope that Buffett’s special wisdom
applies as well to identifying new man-
agerial talent as it does to making
strategic investment decisions.

exchange’s global reach. In point of fact, the NYSE Euronext is the dominant
broker market. The American Stock Exchange (AMEX), which is another
national exchange, and several so-called regional exchanges are also broker mar-
kets. These exchanges account for about 60 percent of the total dollar volume of
all shares traded in the U.S. stock market. In broker markets all the trading takes
place on centralized trading floors.
Most exchanges are modeled after the New York Stock Exchange. For a
firm’s securities to be listed for trading on a stock exchange, a firm must file an
application for listing and meet a number of requirements. For example, to be eli-
gible for listing on the NYSE, a firm must have at least 400 stockholders owning
100 or more shares; a minimum of 1.1 million shares of publicly held stock out-
standing; pretax earnings of at least $10 million over the previous 3 years, with at
least $2 million in the previous 2 years; and a minimum market value of public
shares of $100 million. Clearly, only large, widely held firms are candidates for
NYSE listing.
Once placed, an order to buy or sell on the NYSE can be executed in minutes,

(www.moneycentral.msn.com).
Dealer Markets
One of the key features of the dealer market is that it has
no centralized trading floors. Instead, it is made up of a large number of market
makers who are linked together via a mass-telecommunications network.
Each market maker is actually a securities dealer who makes a market in one
or more securities by offering to buy or sell them at stated bid/ask prices. The bid
price and ask price represent, respectively, the highest price offered to purchase a
given security and the lowest price at which the security is offered for sale. In
effect, an investor pays the ask price when buying securities and receives the bid
price when selling them.
As described earlier, the dealer market is made up of both the Nasdaq
market and the over-the-counter (OTC) market, which together account for
about 40 percent of all shares traded in the U.S. market—with the Nasdaq
accounting for the overwhelming majority of those trades. (As an aside, the
primary market is also a dealer market because all new issues are sold to the
investing public by securities dealers, acting on behalf of the investment
banker.)
The largest dealer market consists of a select group of stocks that are listed
and traded on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated
Quotation System, typically referred to as Nasdaq. Founded in 1971, Nasdaq had
its origins in the OTC market but is today considered a totally separate entity
that’s no longer a part of the OTC market. In fact, in 2006 Nasdaq was formally
recognized by the SEC as a “listed exchange,” essentially giving it the same stature
and prestige as the NYSE.
International Capital Markets
Although U.S. capital markets are by far the world’s largest, there are important
debt and equity markets outside the United States. In the Eurobond market, cor-
porations and governments typically issue bonds denominated in dollars and sell
them to investors located outside the United States. A U.S. corporation might, for
example, issue dollar-denominated bonds that would be purchased by investors
in Belgium, Germany, or Switzerland. Through the Eurobond market, issuing
firms and governments can tap a much larger pool of investors than would be
generally available in the local market.

Matter of fact
A
ccording to the World Federation of Exchanges, the largest stock market in the world, 
as measured by the total market value of securities listed on that market, is the NYSE
Euronext, with listed securities worth more than $11.8 trillion in the United States and $2.9
trillion in Europe. Next largest is the London Stock Exchange, with securities valued at £1.7
trillion, which is equivalent to $2.8 trillion given the exchange rate between pounds and dol-
lars prevailing at the end of 2009.
NYSE Euronext is the World’s Largest Stock Exchange
Eurobond market
The market in which
corporations and governments
typically issue bonds
denominated in dollars and sell
them to investors located
outside the United States.

The foreign bond market is an international market for long-term debt secu-
rities. A foreign bond is a bond issued by a foreign corporation or government
that is denominated in the investor’s home currency and sold in the investor’s
home market. A bond issued by a U.S. company that is denominated in Swiss
francs and sold in Switzerland is a foreign bond. Although the foreign bond
market is smaller than the Eurobond market, many issuers have found it to be an
attractive way of tapping debt markets around the world.
Finally, the international equity market allows corporations to sell blocks of
shares to investors in a number of different countries simultaneously. This market
enables corporations to raise far larger amounts of capital than they could in any
single market. International equity sales have been indispensable to governments
that have sold state-owned companies to private investors.
The Role of Capital Markets
From a firm’s perspective, the role of a capital market is to be a liquid market
where firms can interact with investors to obtain valuable external financing
resources. From investors’ perspectives, the role of a capital market is to be an
efficient market that allocates funds to their most productive uses. This is espe-
cially true for securities that are actively traded in broker or dealer markets,
where the competition among wealth-maximizing investors determines and pub-
licizes prices that are believed to be close to their true value.
The price of an individual security is determined by the interaction between
buyers and sellers in the market. If the market is efficient, the price of a stock is
an unbiased estimate of its true value, and changes in the price reflect new infor-
mation that investors learn about and act on. For example, suppose a certain
stock currently trades at $40 per share. If this company announces that sales of a
new product have been higher than expected, investors will raise their estimate of
what the stock is truly worth. At $40, the stock is a relative bargain, so there will
temporarily be more buyers than sellers wanting to trade the stock, and its price
will have to rise to restore equilibrium in the market. The more efficient the
market is, the more rapidly this whole process works. In theory, even information
known only to insiders may become incorporated in stock prices as the Focus on
Ethics box on page 40 explains.
Not everyone agrees that prices in financial markets are as efficient as
described in the preceding paragraph. Advocates of behavioral finance, an
emerging field that blends ideas from finance and psychology, argue that stock
prices and prices of other securities can deviate from their true values for
extended periods. These people point to episodes such as the huge run-up and
subsequent collapse of the prices of Internet stocks in the late 1990s and the
failure of markets to accurately assess the risk of mortgage-backed securities in
the more recent financial crisis as examples of the principle that stock prices
sometimes can be wildly inaccurate measures of value.
Just how efficient are the prices in financial markets? That is a question that
will be debated for a long time. It is clear that prices do move in response to new
information, and for most investors and corporate managers the best advice is
probably to be cautious when betting against the market. Identifying securities
that the market has over- or undervalued is extremely difficult, and very few
people have demonstrated an ability to bet against the market correctly for an
extended time.

focus on ETHICS
The Ethics of Insider Trading
On December 27,
2001, Martha Stewart
sold nearly 4,000 shares in ImClone
Systems stock. The following day, the
Food and Drug Administration deliv-
ered some bad news regarding
ImClone’s cancer drug, Erbitux, and
ImClone’s stock price dropped substan-
tially. It appeared that Martha Stewart
had picked the right time to sell.
Martha Stewart was not the only
ImClone shareholder who was selling.
The company’s founder, Sam Waksal,
also tried to sell his stock (brokers
refused to execute the sales), as did his
daughter. The U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation were soon look-
ing into the transactions. Sam Waksal
ultimately received an 87-month prison
sentence and $3 million in fines for
insider trading and tax evasion. Martha
Stewart was convicted of conspiracy,
obstruction, and making false state-
ments to federal investigators and
served 5 months in jail, 5 months of
home confinement, and 2 years of pro-
bation and paid a $30,000 fine. In
addition, she was forced to resign as
chairman and CEO of the company
she had founded, Martha Stewart
Living Omnimedia. On the day of her
conviction, the company’s shares lost
23 percent of their value.
Laws prohibiting insider trading
were established in the United States in
the 1930s. These laws are designed to
ensure that all investors have access to
relevant information on the same terms.
However, many market participants
believe that insider trading should be
permitted. Their argument is rooted in
the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH).
According to the EMH, stock prices
fully reflect all publicly available infor-
mation. Of course, a significant amount
of information about every company is
not publicly available. Thus, stock
prices may not accurately reflect all that
is known about a company.
Those who argue for allowing
insider trading believe that market
prices influence the allocation of
resources among companies. Firms 
with higher stock prices find it easier to
raise capital, for example. Therefore, 
it is important that market prices reflect
as much information as possible. Ad-
vocates of allowing insider trading
argue that investors would quickly 
convert inside information into publicly
available information if insider trading
were permitted. If, for example, Sam
Waksal had been permitted to sell his
stock after learning of the FDA’s deci-
sion, market participants might view his
actions and come to the judgment that
ImClone’s prospects had dimmed. Of
course, the other necessary condition is
that outsiders can observe the stock
market transactions of insiders.
Interestingly, Eugene Fama, who is
viewed by many as the father of the
efficient-market hypothesis, does not
believe that insider trading should be
permitted.a Fama believes that allowing
insider trading creates a moral hazard
problem. For example, if insiders are
allowed to trade on proprietary infor-
mation, they may have the incentive to
hold back information for their personal
gain.
3 If efficiency is the goal of financial
markets, is allowing or disallowing
insider trading more unethical?

ate an ethical dilemma for insiders?

The Financial Market Environment

2.2 The Financial Crisis
In the summer and fall of 2008, the U.S. financial system, and financial systems
around the world, appeared to be on the verge of collapse. Troubles in the finan-
cial sector spread to other industries, and a severe global recession ensued. In this
section, we outline some of the main causes and consequences of that crisis.
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND REAL ESTATE FINANCE
In the classic film It’s a Wonderful Life, the central character is George Bailey,
who runs a financial institution called the Bailey Building and Loan Association.
In a key scene in that movie, a bank run is about to occur and depositors demand
that George return the money that they invested in the Building and Loan.
George pleads with one man to keep his funds at the bank, saying:
You’re thinking of this place all wrong, as if I have the money back in a safe. The
money’s not here. Your money is in Joe’s house. That’s right next to yours—and then
the Kennedy house, and Mrs. Maklin’s house, and a hundred others. You’re lending
them the money to build, and then they’re going to pay it back to you as best they
can. What are you going to do, foreclose on them?
This scene offers a relatively realistic portrayal of the role that financial insti-
tutions played in allocating credit for investments in residential real estate for
many years. Local banks took deposits and made loans to local borrowers.
However, since the 1970s, a process called securitization has changed the way
that mortgage finance works. Securitization refers to the process of pooling mort-
gages or other types of loans and then selling claims or securities against that pool
in a secondary market. These securities, called mortgage-backed securities, can be
purchased by individual investors, pension funds, mutual funds, or virtually any
other investor. As homeowners repay their loans, those payments eventually
make their way into the hands of investors who hold the mortgage-backed secu-
rities. Therefore, a primary risk associated with mortgage-backed securities is
that homeowners may not be able to, or may choose not to, repay their loans.
Banks today still lend money to individuals who want to build or purchase new
homes, but they typically bundle those loans together and sell them to organiza-
tions that securitize them and pass them on to investors all over the world.
FALLING HOME PRICES AND DELINQUENT MORTGAGES
Prior to the 2008 financial crisis, most investors viewed mortgage-backed securi-
ties as relatively safe investments. Figure 2.2 on page 42 illustrates one of the main
reasons for this view. The figure shows the behavior of the Standard & Poor’s
Case-Shiller Index, a barometer of home prices in ten major U.S. cities, in each
month from January 1987 to February 2010. Historically, declines in the index
were relatively infrequent, and between July 1995 and April 2006 the index rose
continuously without posting even a single monthly decline. When house prices
are rising, the gap between what a borrower owes on a home and what the home
is worth widens. Lenders will allow borrowers who have difficulty making pay-
ments on their mortgages to tap this built-up home equity to refinance their loans
and lower their payments. Therefore, rising home prices helped keep mortgage
default rates low from the mid-1990s through 2006. Investing in real estate and
mortgage-backed securities seemed to involve very little risk during this period.

mortgages or other types of
loans and then selling claims
or securities against that pool

mortgage-backed securities

LG 4

In part because real estate investments appeared to be relatively safe, lenders
began relaxing their standards for borrowers. This led to tremendous growth in a
category of loans called subprime mortgages. Subprime mortgages are mortgage
loans made to borrowers with lower incomes and poorer credit histories as com-
pared to “prime” borrowers. Often, loans granted to subprime borrowers have
adjustable, rather than fixed, interest rates. This makes subprime borrowers par-
ticularly vulnerable if interest rates rise, and many of these borrowers (and
lenders) assumed that rising home prices would allow borrowers to refinance their
loans if they had difficulties making payments. Partly through the growth of sub-
prime mortgages, banks and other financial institutions gradually increased their
investments in real estate loans. In the year 2000, real estate loans accounted for
less than 40 percent of the total loan portfolios of large banks. By 2007, real estate
loans grew to more than half of all loans made by large banks, and the fraction of
these loans in the subprime category increased as well.
Unfortunately, as Figure 2.2 shows, home prices fell almost without interrup-
tion from May 2006 through May 2009. Over that three-year period, home
prices fell on average by more than 30 percent. Not surprisingly, when home-
owners had difficulty making their mortgage payments, refinancing was no
longer an option, and delinquency rates and foreclosures began to climb. By
2009, nearly 25 percent of subprime borrowers were behind schedule on their
mortgage payments. Some borrowers, recognizing that the value of their homes
was far less than the amount they owed on their mortgages, simply walked away
from their homes and let lenders repossess them.
CRISIS OF CONFIDENCE IN BANKS
With delinquency rates rising, the value of mortgage-backed securities began to
fall, and so too did the fortunes of financial institutions that had invested heavily
in real estate assets. In March 2008, the Federal Reserve provided financing for
the acquisition (that is, the rescue) of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase. Later that
year, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. Throughout 2008 and 2009, the
Federal Reserve, the Bush administration, and finally the Obama administration
took unprecedented steps to try to shore up the banking sector and stimulate the
economy, but these measures could not completely avert the crisis.

Figure 2.3 shows the behavior of the Standard & Poor’s Banking Index, an
index that tracks bank stocks. Bank stocks fell 81 percent between January 2008
and March 2009, and the number of bank failures skyrocketed. According to the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), only three banks failed in 2007.
In 2008 that number rose by a factor of eight to 25 failed banks, and the number
increased nearly six times to 140 failures in 2009. While the economy began to
recover in 2010, bank failures continued at a rapid pace, with 139 institutions
failing in the first 10 months of that year.
SPILLOVER EFFECTS AND THE GREAT RECESSION
As banks came under intense financial pressure in 2008, they began to tighten
their lending standards and dramatically reduced the quantity of loans they made.
In the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, lending in the money market
contracted very sharply. Corporations who had relied on the money market as a
source of short-term funding found that they could no longer raise money in this
market or could do so only at extraordinarily high rates.
As a consequence, businesses began to hoard cash and cut back on expendi-
tures, and economic activity contracted. Gross domestic product (GDP) declined
in five out of six quarters starting in the first quarter of 2008, and the economy
shed more than 8 million jobs in 2008–2009 as the unemployment rate reached
10 percent. Congress passed an $862 billion stimulus package to try to revive the
economy, and the Federal Reserve pushed short-term interest rates close to 0 per-
cent. By late 2009 and early 2010, there were signs that a gradual economic
recovery had begun, but the job market remained stagnant, and most forecasts
called for anemic economic growth.
Perhaps the most important lesson from this episode is how important finan-
cial institutions are to a modern economy. By some measures, the 2008–2009
recession was the worst experienced in the United States since the Great
Depression. Indeed, there many parallels between those two economic contrac-
tions. Both were preceded by a period of rapid economic growth, rising stock
prices, and movements by banks into new lines of business, and both involved a

tend to be more severe than other recessions because so many businesses rely on
credit to operate. When financial institutions contract borrowing, activity in most
other industries slows down too.

Introduction to Managerial Finance
2.3 Regulation of Financial Institutions 
and Markets
The previous section discussed just how vulnerable modern economies are when
financial institutions are in a state of crisis. Partly to avoid these types of prob-
lems, governments typically regulate financial institutions and markets as much
or more than almost any other sector in the economy. This section provides an
overview of the financial regulatory landscape in the United States.
REGULATIONS GOVERNING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
As mentioned in the previous section, Congress passed the Glass-Steagall Act in
1933 during the depths of the Great Depression. The early 1930s witnessed a
series of banking panics that caused almost one-third of the nation’s banks to fail.
Troubles within the banking sector and other factors contributed to the worst
economic contraction in U.S. history, in which industrial production fell by more
than 50 percent, the unemployment rate peaked at almost 25 percent, and stock
prices dropped roughly 86 percent. The Glass-Steagall Act attempted to calm the
public’s fears about the banking industry by establishing the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which provided deposit insurance, effectively
guaranteeing that individuals would not lose their money if they held it in a bank
that failed. The FDIC was also charged with examining banks on a regular basis
to ensure that they were “safe and sound.” The Glass-Steagall Act also prohibited
institutions that took deposits from engaging in activities such as securities
underwriting and trading, thereby effectively separating commercial banks from
investment banks.
Over time, U.S. financial institutions faced competitive pressures from both
domestic and foreign businesses that engaged in facilitating loans or making

loans directly. Because these competitors either did not accept deposits or were
located outside the United States, they were not subject to the same regulations as
domestic banks. As a result, domestic banks began to lose market share in their
core businesses. Pressure mounted to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act to enable U.S.
banks to compete more effectively, and in 1999 Congress enacted and President
Clinton signed the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which allows commercial banks,
investment banks, and insurance companies to consolidate and compete for busi-
ness in a wider range of activities.
In the aftermath of the recent financial crisis and recession, Congress passed
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in July 2010.
In print, the new law runs for hundreds of pages and calls for the creation of sev-
eral new agencies including the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the Office
of Financial Research, and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. The act
also realigns the duties of several existing agencies and requires existing and new
agencies to report to Congress regularly. As this book was going to press, the var-
ious agencies affected or created by the new law were writing rules specifying
how the new law’s provisions would be implemented, so exactly how the new leg-
islation will affect financial institutions and markets remains unclear.
REGULATIONS GOVERNING FINANCIAL MARKETS
Two other pieces of legislation were passed during the Great Depression that had
an enormous impact on the regulation of financial markets. The Securities Act of
1933 imposed new regulations governing the sale of new securities. That is, the
1933 act was intended to regulate activity in the primary market in which securi-
ties are initially issued to the public. The act was designed to insure that the
sellers of new securities provided extensive disclosures to the potential buyers of
those securities.
The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 regulates the secondary trading of secu-
rities such as stocks and bonds. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 also created
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is the primary agency
responsible for enforcing federal securities laws. In addition to the one-time dis-
closures required of security issuers by the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 requires ongoing disclosure by companies whose securities
trade in secondary markets. Companies must make a 10-Q filing every quarter
and a 10-K filing annually. The 10-Q and 10-K forms contain detailed informa-
tion about the financial performance of the firm during the relevant period.
Today, these forms are available online through the SEC’s website known as
EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval). The 1934 act also
imposes limits on the extent to which corporate “insiders,” such as senior man-
agers, can trade in their firm’s securities.

2.4 Business Taxes
Taxes are a fact of life, and businesses, like individuals, must pay taxes on income.
The income of sole proprietorships and partnerships is taxed as the income of the
individual owners; corporate income is subject to corporate taxes.
Regardless of their legal form, all businesses can earn two types of income,
ordinary and capital gains. Under current law, these two types of income are
treated differently in the taxation of individuals; they are not treated differently
for entities subject to corporate taxes. However, frequent amendments are made
to the tax code, particularly as economic conditions change and when party con-
trol of the legislative and executive branches of government shifts.
ORDINARY INCOME
The ordinary income of a corporation is income earned through the sale of goods
or services. Ordinary income in 2010 was taxed subject to the rates depicted in
the corporate tax rate schedule in Table 2.1.
Webster Manufacturing, Inc., a small manufacturer of kitchen knives, has before-
tax earnings of $250,000. The tax on these earnings can be found by using the
tax rate schedule in Table 2.1:
From a financial point of view, it is important to understand the difference
between average and marginal tax rates, the treatment of interest and dividend
income, and the effects of tax deductibility.
Marginal versus Average Tax Rates
The marginal tax rate represents the rate at which the next dollar of income is
taxed. In the current corporate tax structure, the marginal tax rate is 15 percent
= $22,250 + $58,500 = $80,750
= $22,250 + (0.39 * $150,000)
Total taxes due = $22,250 + 30.39 * ($250,000 - $100,000)4

income is taxed.

if the firm earns less than $50,000. If a firm earns more than $50,000 but less
than $75,000, the marginal tax rate is 25 percent. As a firm’s income rises, the
marginal tax rate that it faces changes as shown in Table 2.1. In the example
above, if Webster Manufacturing’s earnings increase to $250,001, the last $1 in
income would be taxed at the marginal rate of 39 percent.
The average tax rate paid on the firm’s ordinary income can be calculated
by dividing its taxes by its taxable income. For most firms, the average tax rate
does not equal the marginal tax rate because tax rates change with income
levels. In the example above, Webster Manufacturing’s marginal tax rate is 
39 percent, but its average tax rate is 32.3 percent 
. 
For very large corporations with earnings in the hundreds of millions or even 
billions of dollars, the average tax rate is very close to the 35 percent mar-
ginal rate in the top bracket because most of the firm’s income is taxed at 
that rate.
In most of the business decisions that managers make, it’s the marginal tax
rate that really matters. To keep matters simple, the examples in this text will use
a flat 40 percent tax rate. That means that both the average tax rate and the mar-
ginal tax rate equal 40 percent.
Interest and Dividend Income
In the process of determining taxable income, any interest received by the corpo-
ration is included as ordinary income. Dividends, on the other hand, are treated
differently. This different treatment moderates the effect of double taxation,
which occurs when the already once-taxed earnings of a corporation are distrib-
uted as cash dividends to stockholders, who must pay taxes on dividends up to a
maximum rate of 15 percent. Dividends that the firm receives on common and
preferred stock held in other corporations are subject to a 70 percent exclusion
for tax purposes.2 The dividend exclusion in effect eliminates most of the poten-
tial tax liability from the dividends received by the second and any subsequent
corporations.
Tax-Deductible Expenses
In calculating their taxes, corporations are allowed to deduct operating
expenses, as well as interest expense. The tax deductibility of these expenses
reduces their after-tax cost. The following example illustrates the benefit of tax
deductibility.
Two companies, Debt Co. and No-Debt Co., both expect in the coming year to
have earnings before interest and taxes of $200,000. During the year, Debt Co.
will have to pay $30,000 in interest. No-Debt Co. has no debt and therefore will

2. The 70 percent exclusion applies if the firm receiving dividends owns less than 20 percent of the shares of the firm
paying the dividends. The exclusion is 80 percent if the corporation owns between 20 percent and 80 percent of the
stock in the corporation paying it dividends; 100 percent of the dividends received are excluded if it owns more than
80 percent of the corporation paying it dividends. For convenience, we are assuming here that the ownership interest
in the dividend-paying corporation is less than 20 percent.
average tax rate
A firm’s taxes divided by its
taxable income.
double taxation
Situation that occurs when
after-tax corporate earnings
are distributed as cash
dividends to stockholders, who
then must pay personal taxes
on the dividend amount.

Debt Co. had $30,000 more interest expense than No-Debt Co., but Debt Co.’s
earnings after taxes are only $18,000 less than those of No-Debt Co. This differ-
ence is attributable to the fact that Debt Co.’s $30,000 interest expense deduction
provided a tax savings of $12,000 ($68,000 for Debt Co. versus $80,000 for 
No-Debt Co.). This amount can be calculated directly by multiplying the tax rate
by the amount of interest expense 
. Similarly, the
$18,000 after-tax cost of the interest expense can be calculated directly by multiplying
1 minus the tax rate by the amount of interest expense 
.
The tax deductibility of expenses reduces their actual (after-tax) cost to the
firm as long as the firm is profitable. If a firm experiences a net loss in a given
year, its tax liability is already zero. Even in this case, losses in one year can be
used to offset taxes paid on profits in prior years, and in some cases losses can be
“carried forward” to offset income and lower taxes in subsequent years. Note
that both for accounting and tax purposes interest is a tax-deductible expense,
whereas dividends are not. Because dividends are not tax deductible, their after-
tax cost is equal to the amount of the dividend. Thus a $30,000 cash dividend has
an after-tax cost of $30,000.
CAPITAL GAINS
If a firm sells a capital asset (such as stock held as an investment) for more than it
paid for the asset, the difference between the sale price and purchase price is
called a capital gain. For corporations, capital gains are added to ordinary corpo-
rate income and taxed at the regular corporate rates.
Ross Company, a manufacturer of pharmaceuticals, has pretax operating earn-
ings of $500,000 and has just sold for $150,000 an asset that was purchased 
2 years ago for $125,000. Because the asset was sold for more than its initial pur-
chase price, there is a capital gain of $25,000 ($150,000 sale price
$125,000
initial purchase price). The corporation’s taxable income will total $525,000
($500,000 ordinary income plus $25,000 capital gain). Multiplying their taxable
income by 40% produces Ross Company’s tax liability of $210,000.

Summary
THE ROLE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND MARKETS
Chapter 2 described why financial institutions and markets are an integral part
of managerial finance. Companies cannot get started or survive without raising
capital, and financial institutions and markets give firms access to the money
they need to grow. As we have seen in recent years, however, financial markets
can be quite turbulent, and when large financial institutions get into trouble,
access to capital is reduced and firms throughout the economy suffer as a result.
Taxes are an important part of this story as well because the rules governing how
business income is taxed shape the incentives of firms to make new investments.
REVIEW OF LEARNING GOALS
Understand the role that financial institutions play in managerial
finance. Financial institutions bring net suppliers of funds and net demanders
together to help translate the savings of individuals, businesses, and govern-
ments into loans and other types of investments. The net suppliers of funds are
generally individuals or households who save more money than they borrow.
Businesses and governments are generally net demanders of funds, meaning that
they borrow more money than they save.
Contrast the functions of financial institutions and financial markets.
Both financial institutions and financial markets help businesses raise the money
that they need to fund new investments for growth. Financial institutions collect
the savings of individuals and channel those funds to borrowers such as busi-
nesses and governments. Financial markets provide a forum in which savers and
borrowers can transact business directly. Businesses and governments issue debt
and equity securities directly to the public in the primary market. Subsequent
trading of these securities between investors occurs in the secondary market.
Describe the differences between the capital markets and the money
markets. In the money market, savers who want a temporary place to deposit
funds where they can earn interest interact with borrowers who have a short-
term need for funds. Marketable securities including Treasury bills, commercial
paper, and other instruments are the primary securities traded in the money
market. The Eurocurrency market is the international equivalent of the domestic
money market.
LG 3
LG 2
LG 1

In contrast, the capital market is the forum in which savers and borrowers
interact on a long-term basis. Firms issue either debt (bonds) or equity (stock)
securities in the capital market. Once issued, these securities trade on secondary
markets that are either broker markets or dealer markets. An important func-
tion of the capital market is to determine the underlying value of the securities
issued by businesses. In an efficient market, the price of a security is an unbiased
estimate of its true value.
Explain the root causes of the 2008 financial crisis and recession. The
financial crisis was caused by several factors related to investments in real estate.
Financial institutions lowered their standards for lending to prospective home-
owners, and institutions also invested heavily in mortgage-backed securities.
When home prices fell and mortgage delinquencies rose, the value of the mort-
gage-backed securities held by banks plummeted, causing some banks to fail and
many others to restrict the flow of credit to business. That in turn contributed to
a severe recession in the United States and abroad.
Understand the major regulations and regulatory bodies that affect
financial institutions and markets. The Glass-Steagall Act created the FDIC and
imposed a separation between commercial and investment banks. The act was
designed to limit the risks that banks could take and to protect depositors. More
recently, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act essentially repealed the elements of Glass-
Steagall pertaining to the separation of commercial and investment banks. After
the recent financial crisis, much debate has occurred regarding the proper regu-
lation of large financial institutions.
The Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are the
major pieces of legislation shaping the regulation of financial markets. The 1933
act focuses on regulating the sale of securities in the primary market, whereas
the 1934 act deals with regulations governing transactions in the secondary
market. The 1934 act also created the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
the primary body responsible for enforcing federal securities laws.
Discuss business taxes and their importance in financial decisions.
Corporate income is subject to corporate taxes. Corporate tax rates apply 
to both ordinary income (after deduction of allowable expenses) and capital
gains. The average tax rate paid by a corporation ranges from 15 to 35 percent.
Corporate taxpayers can reduce their taxes through certain provisions in the tax
code: dividend income exclusions and tax-deductible expenses. A capital gain
occurs when an asset is sold for more than its initial purchase price; gains are
added to ordinary corporate income and taxed at regular corporate tax rates.
(For convenience, we assume a 40 percent marginal tax rate in this book.)

Merit Enterprise Corp.
S
ara Lehn, chief financial officer of Merit Enterprise Corp., was reviewing her
presentation one last time before her upcoming meeting with the board of direc-
tors. Merit’s business had been brisk for the last two years, and the company’s CEO
was pushing for a dramatic expansion of Merit’s production capacity. Executing the
CEO’s plans would require $4 billion in capital in addition to $2 billion in excess
cash that the firm had built up. Sara’s immediate task was to brief the board on
options for raising the needed $4 billion.
Unlike most companies its size, Merit had maintained its status as a private
company, financing its growth by reinvesting profits and, when necessary, borrowing
from banks. Whether Merit could follow that same strategy to raise the $4 billion
necessary to expand at the pace envisioned by the firm’s CEO was uncertain, though
it seemed unlikely to Sara. She had identified two options for the board to consider:
Option 1: Merit could approach JPMorgan Chase, a bank that had served Merit
well for many years with seasonal credit lines as well as medium-term loans. Lehn
believed that JPMorgan was unlikely to make a $4 billion loan to Merit on its own,
but it could probably gather a group of banks together to make a loan of this magni-
tude. However, the banks would undoubtedly demand that Merit limit further bor-
rowing and provide JPMorgan with periodic financial disclosures so that they could
monitor Merit’s financial condition as it expanded its operations.
Option 2: Merit could convert to public ownership, issuing stock to the public
in the primary market. With Merit’s excellent financial performance in recent years,
Sara thought that its stock could command a high price in the market and that many
investors would want to participate in any stock offering that Merit conducted.
Becoming a public company would also allow Merit, for the first time, to offer
employees compensation in the form of stock or stock options, thereby creating
stronger incentives for employees to help the firm succeed. On the other hand, Sara
knew that public companies faced extensive disclosure requirements and other regu-
lations that Merit had never had to confront as a private firm. Furthermore, with
stock trading in the secondary market, who knew what kind of individuals or insti-
tutions might wind up holding a large chunk of Merit stock?
TO DO
a. Discuss the pros and cons of option 1, and prioritize your thoughts. What are the
most positive aspects of this option, and what are the biggest drawbacks?
b. Do the same for option 2.
c. Which option do you think Sara should recommend to the board and why?

n Part 2 you will learn about some of the basic analytical tools that financial
managers use almost every day. Chapter 3 reviews the main financial statements
that are the primary means by which firms communicate with investors, analysts, and
the rest of the business community. Chapter 3 also illustrates some simple tools that
managers use to analyze the information contained in financial statements to identify
and diagnose financial problems.
Firms create financial statements using the accrual principles of accounting, but in
finance it is cash flow that really matters. Chapter 4 shows how to use financial
statements to determine how much cash flow a firm is generating and how it is
spending that cash flow. Chapter 4 also explains how firms develop short-term and
long-term financial plans.
Managers have to decide whether the up-front costs of investments are justified by the
subsequent cash that those investments are likely to produce. Chapter 5 illustrates
techniques that firms use to evaluate these sorts of trade-offs.

Why This Chapter Matters to You
In your professional life
ACCOUNTING You need to understand the stockholders’ report and
preparation of the four key financial statements; how firms consolidate
international financial statements; and how to calculate and interpret
financial ratios for decision making.
INFORMATION SYSTEMS You need to understand what data are
included in the firm’s financial statements to design systems that will
supply such data to those who prepare the statements and to those in
the firm who use the data for ratio calculations.
MANAGEMENT You need to understand what parties are interested in
the stockholders’ report and why; how the financial statements will be
analyzed by those both inside and outside the firm to assess various
aspects of performance; the caution that should be exercised in using
financial ratio analysis; and how the financial statements affect the
value of the firm.
MARKETING You need to understand the effects your decisions will
have on the financial statements, particularly the income statement and
the statement of cash flows, and how analysis of ratios, especially
those involving sales figures, will affect the firm’s decisions about levels
of inventory, credit policies, and pricing decisions.
OPERATIONS You need to understand how the costs of operations are
reflected in the firm’s financial statements and how analysis of ratios,
particularly those involving assets, cost of goods sold, or inventory,
may affect requests for new equipment or facilities.
A routine step in personal financial
planning is to prepare and analyze
personal financial statements, so that you can monitor progress toward
your financial goals. Also, you need to understand and analyze corpo-
rate financial statements to build and monitor your investment portfolio.

The Value of Casual Luxury
A
May 15, 2010, post on an investment website, 
Motley Fool, provided a valuation analysis for
clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch. Abercrombie’s
stock price had been trending down for several weeks,
and given that recent months had only just seen the
end of one of the worst recessions in two generations,
Motley Fool analysts did not expect the firm’s financial
condition to be particularly impressive. However, they
noted that Abercrombie’s current ratio was a healthy 2.79, and its quick ratio was also strong at
1.79. Furthermore, analysts noted that Abercrombie’s receivables collection period had quick-
ened to 43 days in the prior year, and they concluded their report with a relatively positive out-
look for the stock.
Just a few days later, Abercrombie & Fitch announced that it would scale back planned
overseas store openings, the markets where it had been enjoying the most rapid growth. In addi-
tion, the company reported that its gross profit margin declined in the most recent quarter. Markets
responded to this information by sending Abercrombie stock down 7 percent on that day.
Valuing the shares of a company is a difficult task. Analysts try to simplify that task by
drawing data from financial reports produced by the company and calculating a variety of
financial ratios using those data. These ratios help analysts answer questions such as, Does the
firm have enough liquidity to pay the bills that will come due in the short term? and, How effec-
tively does the firm collect cash from its customers? In this chapter, you will learn about the main
financial statements that analysts rely on for this type of analysis, and you will see how informa-
tion from those statements can be used to assess the overall performance of a company.

3.1 The Stockholders’ Report
Every corporation has many and varied uses for the standardized records and
reports of its financial activities. Periodically, reports must be prepared for regu-
lators, creditors (lenders), owners, and management. The guidelines used to pre-
pare and maintain financial records and reports are known as generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP). These accounting practices and procedures are
authorized by the accounting profession’s rule-setting body, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB).
In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, enacted in an effort to eliminate
the many disclosure and conflict-of-interest problems of corporations, established
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), a not-for-profit cor-
poration that oversees auditors of public corporations. The PCAOB is charged
with protecting the interests of investors and furthering the public interest in the
preparation of informative, fair, and independent audit reports. The expectation
is that it will instill confidence in investors with regard to the accuracy of the
audited financial statements of public companies.
Publicly owned corporations with more than $5 million in assets and 500 or
more stockholders are required by the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC)—the federal regulatory body that governs the sale and listing of securities—
to provide their stockholders with an annual stockholders’ report. The stock-
holders’ report summarizes and documents the firm’s financial activities during
the past year. It begins with a letter to the stockholders from the firm’s president
and/or chairman of the board.

GLOBAL focus
More Countries Adopt International Financial Reporting Standards
In the United States,
public companies are
required to report financial results using
GAAP. However, accounting standards
vary around the world, and that makes
comparing the financial results of firms
located in different countries quite chal-
lenging. In recent years, many countries
have adopted a system of accounting
principles known as International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS),
which are established by an independ-
ent standards-setting body known as
the International Accounting Standards
Board (IASB). These standards are
designed with the goal of making 
financial statements everywhere under-
standable, reliable, comparable, and
accurate. More than 80 countries now
require listed firms to comply with IFRS,
and dozens more permit or require
firms to follow IFRS to some degree.
Why hasn’t the United States fol-
lowed the global trend of IFRS adop-
tion? Some argue that GAAP is still the
“gold standard,” and a movement to
IFRS would lower the overall quality of
financial reporting made by U.S. firms.
It is true that IFRS generally requires 
less detail than GAAP. Even so, the
Securities and Exchange Commission
has expressed its view that U.S.
investors will benefit as GAAP and IFRS
converge though there is no expecta-
tion that firms in the United States will
be required to switch to IFRS in the
near future.

THE FOUR KEY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The four key financial statements required by the SEC for reporting to share-
holders are (1) the income statement, (2) the balance sheet, (3) the statement of
stockholders’ equity, and (4) the statement of cash flows. The financial state-
ments from the 2012 stockholders’ report of Bartlett Company, a manufacturer
of metal fasteners, are presented and briefly discussed in this section. Most likely,
you have studied these four financial statements in an accounting course, so the
purpose of looking at them here is to refresh your memory of the basics, rather
than provide an exhaustive review.
Income Statement
The income statement provides a financial summary of the firm’s operating results
during a specified period. Most common are income statements covering a 1-year
period ending at a specified date, ordinarily December 31 of the calendar year.

focus on ETHICS
Taking Earnings Reports at Face Value
Near the end of each
quarter, Wall Street’s
much anticipated “earnings season”
arrives. During earnings season, many
companies unveil their quarterly per-
formance. Interest is high, as media
outlets rush to report the latest
announcements, analysts slice and dice
the numbers, and investors buy and sell
based on the news. The most antici-
pated performance metric for most com-
panies is earnings per share (EPS),
which is typically compared to the esti-
mates of the analysts that cover a firm.
Firms that beat analyst estimates often
see their share prices jump, while those
that miss estimates, by even a small
amount, tend to suffer price declines.
Many investors are aware of the
pitfalls of judging firms based on
reported earnings. Specifically, the
complexity of financial reports makes it
easy for managers to mislead investors.
Sometimes, the methods used to mis-
lead investors are within the rules,
albeit not the spirit, of acceptable
accounting practices. Other times, firms
break the rules to make their numbers.
The practice of manipulating earnings
to mislead investors is known as earn-
ings management.
Some firms are notorious for consis-
tently beating analysts’ estimates. For
example, for one 10-year period
(1995–2004), General Electric Co.
(GE) beat Wall Street earnings esti-
mates every quarter, often by only a
penny or two per share. However, in
2009, the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) fined GE
$50 million for improper accounting
practices, including recording sales that
had not yet occurred. When GE went
back to correct the problems identified
by the SEC, they found that net earn-
ings between 2001 and 2007 were a
total of $280 million lower than origi-
nally reported.
In one of his famous letters to the
shareholders of Berskshire Hathaway,
Warren Buffett offers three bits of
advice regarding financial reporting.a
First, he warns that weak visible
accounting practices are typically a
sign of bigger problems. Second, he
suggests that, when you can’t under-
stand management, the reason is prob-
ably that management doesn’t want
you to understand them. Third, he
warns that investors should be suspi-
cious of projections because earnings
and growth do not typically progress in
an orderly fashion. Finally, Buffett notes
that “Managers that always promise to
‘make the numbers’ will at some point
be tempted to make up the numbers.”

tempted to manage earnings?

manage earnings if they disclose
their activities to investors?

PART 2
Financial Tools
Many large firms, however, operate on a 12-month financial cycle, or fiscal year,
that ends at a time other than December 31. In addition, monthly income state-
ments are typically prepared for use by management, and quarterly statements
must be made available to the stockholders of publicly owned corporations.
Table 3.1 presents Bartlett Company’s income statements for the years ended
December 31, 2012 and 2011. The 2012 statement begins with sales revenue—
the total dollar amount of sales during the period—from which the cost of goods
sold is deducted. The resulting gross profit of $986,000 represents the amount
remaining to satisfy operating, financial, and tax costs. Next, operating expenses,
which include selling expense, general and administrative expense, lease expense,
and depreciation expense, are deducted from gross profits. The resulting
operating profits of $418,000 represent the profits earned from producing and
selling products; this amount does not consider financial and tax costs.
(Operating profit is often called earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT.)
Next, the financial cost—interest expense—is subtracted from operating profits

to find net profits (or earnings) before taxes. After subtracting $93,000 in 2012
interest, Bartlett Company had $325,000 of net profits before taxes.
Next, taxes are calculated at the appropriate tax rates and deducted to deter-
mine net profits (or earnings) after taxes. Bartlett Company’s net profits after
taxes for 2012 were $231,000. Any preferred stock dividends must be subtracted
from net profits after taxes to arrive at earnings available for common stock-
holders. This is the amount earned by the firm on behalf of the common stock-
holders during the period.
Dividing earnings available for common stockholders by the number of shares
of common stock outstanding results in earnings per share (EPS). EPS represent the
number of dollars earned during the period on behalf of each outstanding share of
common stock. In 2012, Bartlett Company earned $221,000 for its common stock-
holders, which represents $2.90 for each outstanding share. The actual cash dividend
per share (DPS), which is the dollar amount of cash distributed during the period on
behalf of each outstanding share of common stock, paid in 2012 was $1.29.
Jan and Jon Smith, a mid-30s married couple with no children,
prepared a personal income and expense statement, which is
similar to a corporate income statement. A condensed version of their income and
expense statement follows.

Balance Sheet
The balance sheet presents a summary statement of the firm’s financial position at
a given time. The statement balances the firm’s assets (what it owns) against its
financing, which can be either debt (what it owes) or equity (what was provided
by owners). Bartlett Company’s balance sheets as of December 31 of 2012 and
2011 are presented in Table 3.2. They show a variety of asset, liability (debt), and
equity accounts.
An important distinction is made between short-term and long-term assets
and liabilities. The current assets and current liabilities are short-term assets and
liabilities. This means that they are expected to be converted into cash (current
assets) or paid (current liabilities) within 1 year or less. All other assets and lia-
bilities, along with stockholders’ equity, which is assumed to have an infinite life,
are considered long-term, or fixed, because they are expected to remain on the
firm’s books for more than 1 year.
As is customary, the assets are listed from the most liquid—cash—down to
the least liquid. Marketable securities are very liquid short-term investments, such
as U.S. Treasury bills or certificates of deposit, held by the firm. Because they are
highly liquid, marketable securities are viewed as a form of cash (“near cash”).
Accounts receivable represent the total monies owed the firm by its customers on
credit sales. Inventories include raw materials, work in process (partially finished
goods), and finished goods held by the firm. The entry for gross fixed assets is the
original cost of all fixed (long-term) assets owned by the firm.1 Net fixed assets rep-
resent the difference between gross fixed assets and accumulated depreciation—
the total expense recorded for the depreciation of fixed assets. The net value of
fixed assets is called their book value.
Like assets, the liabilities and equity accounts are listed from short-term to
long-term. Current liabilities include accounts payable, amounts owed for credit
purchases by the firm; notes payable, outstanding short-term loans, typically
from commercial banks; and accruals, amounts owed for services for which a bill
may not or will not be received. Examples of accruals include taxes due the gov-
ernment and wages due employees. Long-term debt represents debt for which
payment is not due in the current year. Stockholders’ equity represents the
owners’ claims on the firm. The preferred stock entry shows the historical pro-
ceeds from the sale of preferred stock ($200,000 for Bartlett Company).
Next, the amount paid by the original purchasers of common stock is shown
by two entries, common stock and paid-in capital in excess of par on common
stock. The common stock entry is the par value of common stock. Paid-in capital
in excess of par represents the amount of proceeds in excess of the par value
received from the original sale of common stock. The sum of the common stock
and paid-in capital accounts divided by the number of shares outstanding represents
the original price per share received by the firm on a single issue of common stock.

TABLE 3.2

Bartlett Company therefore received about $8.12 per share 
from the sale of its
common stock.
Finally, retained earnings represent the cumulative total of all earnings, net of
dividends, that have been retained and reinvested in the firm since its inception. It
is important to recognize that retained earnings are not cash but rather have been
utilized to finance the firm’s assets.
Bartlett Company’s balance sheets in Table 3.2 show that the firm’s total
assets increased from $3,270,000 in 2011 to $3,597,000 in 2012. The $327,000
increase was due primarily to the $219,000 increase in current assets. The asset
increase, in turn, appears to have been financed primarily by an increase of
$193,000 in total liabilities. Better insight into these changes can be derived from
the statement of cash flows, which we will discuss shortly.
The following personal balance sheet for Jan and Jon Smith—
the couple introduced earlier, who are married, in their mid-
30s, and have no children—is similar to a corporate balance sheet.

Statement of Retained Earnings
The statement of retained earnings is an abbreviated form of the statement of
stockholders’ equity. Unlike the statement of stockholders’ equity, which shows
all equity account transactions that occurred during a given year, the statement of
retained earnings reconciles the net income earned during a given year, and any
statement of stockholders’
equity
Shows all equity account
transactions that occurred

cash dividends paid, with the change in retained earnings between the start and
the end of that year. Table 3.3 presents this statement for Bartlett Company for
the year ended December 31, 2012. The statement shows that the company
began the year with $1,012,000 in retained earnings and had net profits after
taxes of $231,000, from which it paid a total of $108,000 in dividends, resulting
in year-end retained earnings of $1,135,000. Thus the net increase for Bartlett
Company was $123,000 ($231,000 net profits after taxes minus $108,000 in
dividends) during 2012.
Statement of Cash Flows
The statement of cash flows is a summary of the cash flows over the period of
concern. The statement provides insight into the firm’s operating, investment,
and financing cash flows and reconciles them with changes in its cash and mar-
ketable securities during the period. Bartlett Company’s statement of cash flows
for the year ended December 31, 2012, is presented in Table 3.4 (see page 66).
Further insight into this statement is included in the discussion of cash flow in
Chapter 4.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Included with published financial statements are explanatory notes keyed to the
relevant accounts in the statements. These notes to the financial statements pro-
vide detailed information on the accounting policies, procedures, calculations,
and transactions underlying entries in the financial statements. Common issues
addressed by these notes include revenue recognition, income taxes, breakdowns
of fixed asset accounts, debt and lease terms, and contingencies. Since passage of
Sarbanes-Oxley, notes to the financial statements have also included some details
about compliance with that law. Professional securities analysts use the data in
the statements and notes to develop estimates of the value of securities that the
firm issues, and these estimates influence the actions of investors and therefore
the firm’s share value.
CONSOLIDATING INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
So far, we’ve discussed financial statements involving only one currency, the
U.S. dollar. The issue of how to consolidate a company’s foreign and domestic
financial statements has bedeviled the accounting profession for many years.

(FASB) Standard No. 52, which mandates that U.S.–based companies translate
their foreign-currency-denominated assets and liabilities into dollars, for consoli-
dation with the parent company’s financial statements. This is done by using a
technique called the current rate (translation) method, under which all of a U.S.
parent company’s foreign-currency-denominated assets and liabilities are con-
verted into dollar values using the exchange rate prevailing at the fiscal year
ending date (the current rate). Income statement items are treated similarly.
Equity accounts, on the other hand, are translated into dollars by using the
exchange rate that prevailed when the parent’s equity investment was made (the
historical rate). Retained earnings are adjusted to reflect each year’s operating
profits or losses.

CHAPTER 3
Financial Statements and Ratio Analysis
67
3.2 Using Financial Ratios
The information contained in the four basic financial statements is of major sig-
nificance to a variety of interested parties who regularly need to have relative
measures of the company’s performance. Relative is the key word here, because
the analysis of financial statements is based on the use of ratios or relative values.
Ratio analysis involves methods of calculating and interpreting financial ratios to
analyze and monitor the firm’s performance. The basic inputs to ratio analysis
are the firm’s income statement and balance sheet.
INTERESTED PARTIES
Ratio analysis of a firm’s financial statements is of interest to shareholders, credi-
tors, and the firm’s own management. Both current and prospective shareholders
are interested in the firm’s current and future level of risk and return, which directly
affect share price. The firm’s creditors are interested primarily in the short-term liq-
uidity of the company and its ability to make interest and principal payments. A
secondary concern of creditors is the firm’s profitability; they want assurance that
the business is healthy. Management, like stockholders, is concerned with all
aspects of the firm’s financial situation, and it attempts to produce financial ratios
that will be considered favorable by both owners and creditors. In addition, man-
agement uses ratios to monitor the firm’s performance from period to period.
TYPES OF RATIO COMPARISONS
Ratio analysis is not merely the calculation of a given ratio. More important is
the interpretation of the ratio value. A meaningful basis for comparison is needed
to answer such questions as “Is it too high or too low?” and “Is it good or bad?”
Two types of ratio comparisons can be made, cross-sectional and time-series.
Cross-Sectional Analysis
Cross-sectional analysis involves the comparison of different firms’ financial
ratios at the same point in time. Analysts are often interested in how well a firm
has performed in relation to other firms in its industry. Frequently, a firm will
compare its ratio values to those of a key competitor or group of competitors that
it wishes to emulate. This type of cross-sectional analysis, called benchmarking,
has become very popular.
Comparison to industry averages is also popular. These figures can be found
in the Almanac of Business and Industrial Financial Ratios, Dun & Bradstreet’s
Industry Norms and Key Business Ratios, RMA Annual Statement Studies, Value
Line, and industry sources. It is also possible to derive financial ratios for yourself
using financial information reported in financial databases, such as Compustat.
Table 3.5 illustrates a brief cross-sectional ratio analysis by comparing several

ratios as of early 2010 for two select firms to each other and the median value for
their particular industry.
Analysts have to be very careful when drawing conclusions from ratio compar-
isons. It’s tempting to assume that if one ratio for a particular firm is above the
industry norm, this is a sign that the firm is performing well, at least along the dimen-
sion measured by that ratio. However, ratios may be above or below the industry
norm for both positive and negative reasons, and it is necessary to determine why
a firm’s performance differs from its industry peers. Thus, ratio analysis on its own
is probably most useful in highlighting areas for further investigation.
In early 2013, Mary Boyle, the chief financial analyst at Caldwell Manufacturing,
a producer of heat exchangers, gathered data on the firm’s financial performance
during 2012, the year just ended. She calculated a variety of ratios and obtained
industry averages. She was especially interested in inventory turnover, which
reflects the speed with which the firm moves its inventory from raw materials
through production into finished goods and to the customer as a completed sale.
Generally, higher values of this ratio are preferred, because they indicate a quicker
turnover of inventory and more efficient inventory management. Caldwell

Mary’s initial reaction to these data was that the firm had managed its inven-
tory significantly better than the average firm in the industry. The turnover was
nearly 53% faster than the industry average. On reflection, however, she realized
that a very high inventory turnover could be a sign that the firm is not holding
enough inventories. The consequence of low inventory could be excessive stock-
outs (insufficient inventory to meet customer needs). Discussions with people in
the manufacturing and marketing departments did, in fact, uncover such a problem:
Inventories during the year were extremely low, the result of numerous produc-
tion delays that hindered the firm’s ability to meet demand and resulted in dis-
gruntled customers and lost sales. A ratio that initially appeared to reflect
extremely efficient inventory management was actually the symptom of a major
problem.
Time-Series Analysis
Time-series analysis evaluates performance over time. Comparison of current to
past performance, using ratios, enables analysts to assess the firm’s progress.
Developing trends can be seen by using multiyear comparisons. Any significant
year-to-year changes may be symptomatic of a problem, especially if the same
trend is not an industry-wide phenomenon.
Combined Analysis
The most informative approach to ratio analysis combines cross-sectional and
time-series analyses. A combined view makes it possible to assess the trend in the
behavior of the ratio in relation to the trend for the industry. Figure 3.1 depicts
this type of approach using the average collection period ratio of Bartlett
Company, over the years 2009–2012. This ratio reflects the average amount of
time (in days) it takes the firm to collect bills, and lower values of this ratio gen-
erally are preferred. The figure quickly discloses that (1) Bartlett’s effectiveness in
collecting its receivables is poor in comparison to the industry, and (2) Bartlett’s
trend is toward longer collection periods. Clearly, Bartlett needs to shorten its
collection period.

CAUTIONS ABOUT USING RATIO ANALYSIS
Before discussing specific ratios, we should consider the following cautions about
their use:
1. Ratios that reveal large deviations from the norm merely indicate the possi-
bility of a problem. Additional analysis is typically needed to determine
whether there is a problem and to isolate the causes of the problem.
2. A single ratio does not generally provide sufficient information from which
to judge the overall performance of the firm. However, if an analysis is con-
cerned only with certain specific aspects of a firm’s financial position, one or
two ratios may suffice.
3. The ratios being compared should be calculated using financial statements
dated at the same point in time during the year. If they are not, the effects of
seasonality may produce erroneous conclusions and decisions.
4. It is preferable to use audited financial statements for ratio analysis. If they
have not been audited, the data in them may not reflect the firm’s true finan-
cial condition.
5. The financial data being compared should have been developed in the same
way. The use of differing accounting treatments—especially relative to inven-
tory and depreciation—can distort the results of ratio comparisons, regard-
less of whether cross-sectional or time-series analysis is used.
6. Results can be distorted by inflation, which can cause the book values of inven-
tory and depreciable assets to differ greatly from their replacement values.
Additionally, inventory costs and depreciation write-offs can differ from their
true values, thereby distorting profits. Without adjustment, inflation tends to
cause older firms (older assets) to appear more efficient and profitable than
newer firms (newer assets). Clearly, in using ratios, you must be careful when
comparing older to newer firms or a firm to itself over a long period of time.
CATEGORIES OF FINANCIAL RATIOS
Financial ratios can be divided for convenience into five basic categories: liq-
uidity, activity, debt, profitability, and market ratios. Liquidity, activity, and debt
ratios primarily measure risk. Profitability ratios measure return. Market ratios
capture both risk and return.
As a rule, the inputs necessary for an effective financial analysis include, at a
minimum, the income statement and the balance sheet. We will use the 2012 and
2011 income statements and balance sheets for Bartlett Company, presented ear-
lier in Tables 3.1 and 3.2, to demonstrate ratio calculations. Note, however, that
the ratios presented in the remainder of this chapter can be applied to almost any
company. Of course, many companies in different industries use ratios that focus
on aspects peculiar to their industry.

3.3 Liquidity Ratios
The liquidity of a firm is measured by its ability to satisfy its short-term obliga-
tions as they come due. Liquidity refers to the solvency of the firm’s overall finan-
cial position—the ease with which it can pay its bills. Because a common
precursor to financial distress and bankruptcy is low or declining liquidity, these
ratios can provide early signs of cash flow problems and impending business
failure. Clearly it is desirable that a firm is able to pay its bills, so having enough
liquidity for day-to-day operations is important. However, liquid assets, like cash
held at banks and marketable securities, do not earn a particularly high rate of
return, so shareholders will not want a firm to overinvest in liquidity. Firms have
to balance the need for safety that liquidity provides against the low returns that
liquid assets generate for investors. The two basic measures of liquidity are the
current ratio and the quick (acid-test) ratio.
CURRENT RATIO
The current ratio, one of the most commonly cited financial ratios, measures the
firm’s ability to meet its short-term obligations. It is expressed as follows:
The current ratio for Bartlett Company in 2012 is
A higher current ratio indicates a greater degree of liquidity. How much liq-
uidity a firm needs depends on a variety of factors, including the firm’s size, its
access to short-term financing sources like bank credit lines, and the volatility of
its business. For example, a grocery store whose revenues are relatively pre-
dictable may not need as much liquidity as a manufacturing firm who faces
sudden and unexpected shifts in demand for its products. The more predictable a
firm’s cash flows, the lower the acceptable current ratio. Because Bartlett
Company is in a business with a relatively predictable annual cash flow, its cur-
rent ratio of 1.97 should be quite acceptable.

Matter of fact
G
lance back at the first column of data in Table 3.5 that shows the current ratio for a variety of
companies and industries. Notice that the industry with the highest current ratio (that is, most
liquidity) is building materials, a business that is notoriously sensitive to business cycle swings. The
current ratio for that industry is 2.8, indicating that the typical firm in that business has almost 
three times as much in current assets as in current liabilities. Two of the largest competitors in 
that industry, The Home Depot and Lowe’s, operate with a current ratio of 1.3, less than half the
industry average. Does this mean that these firms have a liquidity problem? Not necessarily. Large
enterprises generally have well-established relationships with banks that can provide lines of credit
and other short-term loan products in the event that the firm has a need for liquidity. Smaller firms
may not have the same access to credit, and therefore they tend to operate with more liquidity.
Determinants of Liquidity Needs
LG 3

Individuals, like corporations, can use financial ratios to ana-
lyze and monitor their performance. Typically, personal finance
ratios are calculated using the personal income and expense statement and per-
sonal balance sheet for the period of concern. Here we use these statements, pre-
sented in the preceding personal finance examples, to demonstrate calculation of
Jan and Jon Smith’s liquidity ratio for calendar year 2012.
The personal liquidity ratio is calculated by dividing total liquid assets by total
current debt. It indicates the percent of annual debt obligations that an individual
can meet using current liquid assets. The Smiths’ total liquid assets were $2,225.
Their total current debts are $21,539 (total current liabilities of 
payments of 
loan payments of 
and furniture
payments of $1,250). Substituting these values into the ratio formula, we get:
That ratio indicates that the Smiths can cover only about 10% of their
existing 1-year debt obligations with their current liquid assets. Clearly, the
Smiths plan to meet these debt obligations from their income, but this ratio sug-
gests that their liquid funds do not provide a large cushion. One of their goals
should probably be to build up a larger fund of liquid assets to meet unexpected
expenses.
QUICK (ACID-TEST) RATIO
The quick (acid-test) ratio is similar to the current ratio except that it excludes
inventory, which is generally the least liquid current asset. The generally low liq-
uidity of inventory results from two primary factors: (1) Many types of inventory
cannot be easily sold because they are partially completed items, special-purpose
items, and the like; and (2) inventory is typically sold on credit, which means that
it becomes an account receivable before being converted into cash. An additional
problem with inventory as a liquid asset is that the times when companies face
the most dire need for liquidity, when business is bad, are precisely the times
when it is most difficult to convert inventory into cash by selling it. The quick
ratio is calculated as follows:
The quick ratio for Bartlett Company in 2012 is
As with the current ratio, the quick ratio level that a firm should strive to
achieve depends largely on the nature of the business in which it operates. The
quick ratio provides a better measure of overall liquidity only when a firm’s
inventory cannot be easily converted into cash. If inventory is liquid, the current
ratio is a preferred measure of overall liquidity.

3–9 Under what circumstances would the current ratio be the preferred
measure of overall firm liquidity? Under what circumstances would the
quick ratio be preferred?
3–10 In Table 3.5, most of the specific firms listed have current ratios that fall
below the industry average. Why? The exception to this general pattern
is Whole Foods Market, which competes at the very high end of the
retail grocery market. Why might Whole Foods Market operate with
greater-than-average liquidity?
CHAPTER 3

T
urn again to Table 3.5 and examine the columns listing current and quick ratios for different
firms and industries. Notice that Dell has a current ratio of 1.3, and so do The Home Depot
and Lowe’s. However, although the quick ratios for The Home Depot and Lowe’s are dramatically
lower than their current ratios, for Dell the current and quick ratios have nearly the same value.
Why? For many years, Dell operated on a “built-to-order” business model that required them to
hold very little inventory. In contrast, all it takes is a trip to your local Home Depot or Lowe’s store
to see that the business model in this industry requires a massive investment in inventory, which
implies that the quick ratio will be much less than the current ratio for building materials firms.
The Importance of Inventories
3.4 Activity Ratios
Activity ratios measure the speed with which various accounts are converted into
sales or cash—inflows or outflows. In a sense, activity ratios measure how efficiently
a firm operates along a variety of dimensions such as inventory management, dis-
bursements, and collections. A number of ratios are available for measuring the
activity of the most important current accounts, which include inventory, accounts
receivable, and accounts payable. The efficiency with which total assets are used
can also be assessed.
INVENTORY TURNOVER
Inventory turnover commonly measures the activity, or liquidity, of a firm’s
inventory. It is calculated as follows:
Applying this relationship to Bartlett Company in 2012 yields
The resulting turnover is meaningful only when it is compared with that of other
firms in the same industry or to the firm’s past inventory turnover. An inventory
turnover of 20 would not be unusual for a grocery store, whose goods are highly
perishable and must be sold quickly, whereas an aircraft manufacturer might turn
its inventory just four times per year.

liquidity, of a firm’s inventory.
LG 3

Another inventory activity ratio measures how many days of inventory the
firm has on hand. Inventory turnover can be easily converted into an average age
of inventory by dividing it into 365. For Bartlett Company, the average age of
inventory in 2012 is 50.7 days (365
7.2). This value can also be viewed as the
average number of days’ sales in inventory.
AVERAGE COLLECTION PERIOD
The average collection period, or average age of accounts receivable, is useful in
evaluating credit and collection policies. It is arrived at by dividing the average
daily sales into the accounts receivable balance:2
The average collection period for Bartlett Company in 2012 is
On the average, it takes the firm 59.7 days to collect an account receivable.
The average collection period is meaningful only in relation to the firm’s credit
terms. If Bartlett Company extends 30-day credit terms to customers, an average
collection period of 59.7 days may indicate a poorly managed credit or collection
department, or both. It is also possible that the lengthened collection period resulted
from an intentional relaxation of credit-term enforcement in response to competitive
pressures. If the firm had extended 60-day credit terms, the 59.7-day average collec-
tion period would be quite acceptable. Clearly, additional information is needed to
evaluate the effectiveness of the firm’s credit and collection policies.

N
otice in Table 3.5 the vast differences across industries in the average collection periods.
Companies in the building materials, grocery, and merchandise store industries collect in just
a few days, whereas firms in the computer industry take roughly two months to collect on their
sales. The difference is primarily due to the fact that these industries serve very different cus-
tomers. Grocery and retail stores serve individuals who pay cash or use credit cards (which to the
store are essentially the same as cash). Computer manufacturers sell to retail chains, businesses,
and other large organizations that negotiate agreements that allow them to pay for the computers
they order well after the sale is made.
Who Gets Credit?

AVERAGE PAYMENT PERIOD
The average payment period, or average age of accounts payable, is calculated in
the same manner as the average collection period:
The difficulty in calculating this ratio stems from the need to find annual pur-
chases,3 a value not available in published financial statements. Ordinarily, pur-
chases are estimated as a given percentage of cost of goods sold. If we assume
that Bartlett Company’s purchases equaled 70 percent of its cost of goods sold in
2012, its average payment period is
This figure is meaningful only in relation to the average credit terms extended to
the firm. If Bartlett Company’s suppliers have extended, on average, 30-day
credit terms, an analyst would give Bartlett a low credit rating because it was
taking too long to pay its bills. Prospective lenders and suppliers of trade credit
are interested in the average payment period because it provides insight into the
firm’s bill-paying patterns.
TOTAL ASSET TURNOVER
The total asset turnover indicates the efficiency with which the firm uses its assets
to generate sales. Total asset turnover is calculated as follows:
The value of Bartlett Company’s total asset turnover in 2012 is
This means the company turns over its assets 0.85 times per year.
Generally, the higher a firm’s total asset turnover, the more efficiently its assets
have been used. This measure is probably of greatest interest to management
because it indicates whether the firm’s operations have been financially efficient.

O
bserve in Table 3.5 that the grocery business turns over assets faster than any of the other
industries listed. That makes sense because inventory is among the most valuable assets held
by these firms, and grocery stores have to sell baked goods, dairy products, and produce quickly
or throw them away when they spoil. It’s true that some items in a grocery store have a shelf life
longer than anyone really wants to know (think Twinkies), but on average a grocery store has to
replace its entire inventory in just a few days or weeks, and that contributes to the rapid turnover
of the firm’s total assets.

3.5 Debt Ratios
The debt position of a firm indicates the amount of other people’s money being
used to generate profits. In general, the financial analyst is most concerned with
long-term debts because these commit the firm to a stream of contractual pay-
ments over the long run. The more debt a firm has, the greater its risk of being
unable to meet its contractual debt payments. Because creditors’ claims must be
satisfied before the earnings can be distributed to shareholders, current and
prospective shareholders pay close attention to the firm’s ability to repay debts.
Lenders are also concerned about the firm’s indebtedness.
In general, the more debt a firm uses in relation to its total assets, the greater
its financial leverage. Financial leverage is the magnification of risk and return
through the use of fixed-cost financing, such as debt and preferred stock. The
more fixed-cost debt a firm uses, the greater will be its expected risk and return.
Patty Akers is in the process of incorporating her new business. After much
analysis she determined that an initial investment of $50,000—$20,000 in current
assets and $30,000 in fixed assets—is necessary. These funds can be obtained in
either of two ways. The first is the no-debt plan, under which she would invest the
full $50,000 without borrowing. The other alternative, the debt plan, involves
investing $25,000 and borrowing the balance of $25,000 at 12% annual interest.
Patty expects $30,000 in sales, $18,000 in operating expenses, and a 40%
tax rate. Projected balance sheets and income statements associated with the two
plans are summarized in Table 3.6. The no-debt plan results in after-tax profits of
$7,200, which represent a 14.4% rate of return on Patty’s $50,000 investment.
The debt plan results in $5,400 of after-tax profits, which represent a 21.6% rate
of return on Patty’s investment of $25,000. The debt plan provides Patty with a
higher rate of return, but the risk of this plan is also greater, because the annual
$3,000 of interest must be paid whether Patty’s business is profitable or not.
The example demonstrates that with increased debt comes greater risk as
well as higher potential return. Therefore, the greater the financial leverage, the
greater the potential risk and return. A detailed discussion of the impact of debt
on the firm’s risk, return, and value is included in Chapter 12. Here, we empha-
size the use of financial debt ratios to assess externally a firm’s debt position.
There are two general types of debt measures: measures of the degree of
indebtedness and measures of the ability to service debts. The degree of indebted-
ness measures the amount of debt relative to other significant balance sheet
amounts. A popular measure of the degree of indebtedness is the debt ratio.
The second type of debt measure, the ability to service debts, reflects a firm’s
ability to make the payments required on a scheduled basis over the life of a debt.

LG 4

The term to service debts simply means to pay debts on time. The firm’s ability
to pay certain fixed charges is measured using coverage ratios. Typically, higher
coverage ratios are preferred (especially by the firm’s lenders), but a very high
ratio might indicate that the firm’s management is too conservative and might be
able to earn higher returns by borrowing more. In general, the lower the firm’s
coverage ratios, the less certain it is to be able to pay fixed obligations. If a firm
is unable to pay these obligations, its creditors may seek immediate repayment,
which in most instances would force a firm into bankruptcy. Two popular 
coverage ratios are the times interest earned ratio and the fixed-payment cov-
erage ratio.
DEBT RATIO
The debt ratio measures the proportion of total assets financed by the firm’s cred-
itors. The higher this ratio, the greater the amount of other people’s money being
used to generate profits. The ratio is calculated as follows:
The debt ratio for Bartlett Company in 2012 is
This value indicates that the company has financed close to half of its assets with
debt. The higher this ratio, the greater the firm’s degree of indebtedness and the
more financial leverage it has.

TABLE 3.6

TIMES INTEREST EARNED RATIO
The times interest earned ratio, sometimes called the interest coverage ratio,
measures the firm’s ability to make contractual interest payments. The higher its
value, the better able the firm is to fulfill its interest obligations. The times
interest earned ratio is calculated as follows:
The figure for earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) is the same as that for
operating profits shown in the income statement. Applying this ratio to Bartlett
Company yields the following 2012 value:
The times interest earned ratio for Bartlett Company seems acceptable. A value of at
least 3.0—and preferably closer to 5.0—is often suggested. The firm’s earnings before
interest and taxes could shrink by as much as 78 percent 
and
the firm would still be able to pay the $93,000 in interest it owes. Thus it has a
large margin of safety.
FIXED-PAYMENT COVERAGE RATIO
The fixed-payment coverage ratio measures the firm’s ability to meet all fixed-
payment obligations, such as loan interest and principal, lease payments, and pre-
ferred stock dividends. As is true of the times interest earned ratio, the higher this
value the better. The formula for the fixed-payment coverage ratio is
where T is the corporate tax rate applicable to the firm’s income. The term 1/(1
T)
is included to adjust the after-tax principal and preferred stock dividend pay-
ments back to a before-tax equivalent that is consistent with the before-tax values
of all other terms. Applying the formula to Bartlett Company’s 2012 data yields
Because the earnings available are nearly twice as large as its fixed-payment obli-
gations, the firm appears safely able to meet the latter.
Like the times interest earned ratio, the fixed-payment coverage ratio measures
risk. The lower the ratio, the greater the risk to both lenders and owners, and the
greater the ratio, the lower the risk. This ratio allows interested parties to assess the
firm’s ability to meet additional fixed-payment obligations without being driven
into bankruptcy.

3.6 Profitability Ratios
There are many measures of profitability. As a group, these measures enable ana-
lysts to evaluate the firm’s profits with respect to a given level of sales, a certain
level of assets, or the owners’ investment. Without profits, a firm could not
attract outside capital. Owners, creditors, and management pay close attention to
boosting profits because of the great importance the market places on earnings.
COMMON-SIZE INCOME STATEMENTS
A useful tool for evaluating profitability in relation to sales is the common-size
income statement. Each item on this statement is expressed as a percentage of
sales. Common-size income statements are especially useful in comparing per-
formance across years because it is easy to see if certain categories of expenses are
trending up or down as a percentage of the total volume of business that the com-
pany transacts. Three frequently cited ratios of profitability that come directly
from the common-size income statement are (1) the gross profit margin, (2) the
operating profit margin, and (3) the net profit margin.
Common-size income statements for 2012 and 2011 for Bartlett Company
are presented and evaluated in Table 3.7 on page 80. These statements reveal that
the firm’s cost of goods sold increased from 66.7 percent of sales in 2011 to 67.9
percent in 2012, resulting in a worsening gross profit margin. However, thanks to
a decrease in total operating expenses, the firm’s net profit margin rose from 5.4
percent of sales in 2011 to 7.2 percent in 2012. The decrease in expenses more
than compensated for the increase in the cost of goods sold. A decrease in the
firm’s 2012 interest expense (3.0 percent of sales versus 3.5 percent in 2011)
added to the increase in 2012 profits.
GROSS PROFIT MARGIN
The gross profit margin measures the percentage of each sales dollar remaining
after the firm has paid for its goods. The higher the gross profit margin, the better
(that is, the lower the relative cost of merchandise sold). The gross profit margin
is calculated as follows:
Bartlett Company’s gross profit margin for 2012 is

OPERATING PROFIT MARGIN
The operating profit margin measures the percentage of each sales dollar
remaining after all costs and expenses other than interest, taxes, and preferred
stock dividends are deducted. It represents the “pure profits” earned on each
sales dollar. Operating profits are “pure” because they measure only the profits
earned on operations and ignore interest, taxes, and preferred stock dividends. A
high operating profit margin is preferred. The operating profit margin is calcu-
lated as follows:

This value is labeled (3) on the common-size income statement in Table 3.7.
The net profit margin is a commonly cited measure of the firm’s success with
respect to earnings on sales. “Good” net profit margins differ considerably across
industries. A net profit margin of 1 percent or less would not be unusual for a
grocery store, whereas a net profit margin of 10 percent would be low for a retail
jewelry store.
EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS)
The firm’s earnings per share (EPS) is generally of interest to present or prospec-
tive stockholders and management. As we noted earlier, EPS represents the
number of dollars earned during the period on behalf of each outstanding share
of common stock. Earnings per share is calculated as follows:
Bartlett Company’s earnings per share in 2012 is
This figure represents the dollar amount earned on behalf of each outstanding
share of common stock. The dollar amount of cash actually distributed to each
shareholder is the dividend per share (DPS), which, as noted in Bartlett Company’s
income statement (Table 3.1), rose to $1.29 in 2012 from $0.75 in 2011. EPS is
closely watched by the investing public and is considered an important indicator
of corporate success.
RETURN ON TOTAL ASSETS (ROA)
The return on total assets (ROA), often called the return on investment (ROI),
measures the overall effectiveness of management in generating profits with its
available assets. The higher the firm’s return on total assets the better. The return
on total assets is calculated as follows:
Bartlett Company’s return on total assets in 2012 is
This value indicates that the company earned 6.1 cents on each dollar of asset
investment.

Note that the value for common stock equity ($1,754,000) was found by sub-
tracting the $200,000 of preferred stock equity from the total stockholders’
equity of $1,954,000 (see Bartlett Company’s 2012 balance sheet in Table 3.2).
The calculated ROE of 12.6 percent indicates that during 2012 Bartlett earned
12.6 cents on each dollar of common stock equity.

3.7 Market Ratios
Market ratios relate the firm’s market value, as measured by its current share
price, to certain accounting values. These ratios give insight into how investors in
the marketplace feel the firm is doing in terms of risk and return. They tend to
reflect, on a relative basis, the common stockholders’ assessment of all aspects of
the firm’s past and expected future performance. Here we consider two widely
quoted market ratios, one that focuses on earnings and another that considers
book value.
PRICE/EARNINGS (P/E) RATIO
The price/earnings (P/E) ratio is commonly used to assess the owners’ appraisal
of share value. The P/E ratio measures the amount that investors are willing to
pay for each dollar of a firm’s earnings. The level of this ratio indicates the
degree of confidence that investors have in the firm’s future performance. The
higher the P/E ratio, the greater the investor confidence. The P/E ratio is calcu-
lated as follows:

LG 5

If Bartlett Company’s common stock at the end of 2012 was selling at $32.25,
using the EPS of $2.90, the P/E ratio at year-end 2012 is
This figure indicates that investors were paying $11.10 for each $1.00 of earn-
ings. The P/E ratio is most informative when applied in cross-sectional analysis
using an industry average P/E ratio or the P/E ratio of a benchmark firm.
MARKET/BOOK (M/B) RATIO
The market/book (M/B) ratio provides an assessment of how investors view the
firm’s performance. It relates the market value of the firm’s shares to their book—
strict accounting—value. To calculate the firm’s M/B ratio, we first need to find
the book value per share of common stock:
Substituting the appropriate values for Bartlett Company from its 2012 balance
sheet, we get
The formula for the market/book ratio is
Substituting Bartlett Company’s end of 2012 common stock price of $32.25 and
its $23.00 book value per share of common stock (calculated above) into the M/B
ratio formula, we get
This M/B ratio means that investors are currently paying $1.40 for each $1.00 of
book value of Bartlett Company’s stock.
The stocks of firms that are expected to perform well—improve profits,
increase their market share, or launch successful products—typically sell at
higher M/B ratios than the stocks of firms with less attractive outlooks. Simply
stated, firms expected to earn high returns relative to their risk typically sell at
higher M/B multiples. Clearly, Bartlett’s future prospects are being viewed favor-
ably by investors, who are willing to pay more than their book value for the
firm’s shares. Like P/E ratios, M/B ratios are typically assessed cross-sectionally to
get a feel for the firm’s return and risk compared to peer firms.

3.8 A Complete Ratio Analysis
Analysts frequently wish to take an overall look at the firm’s financial perform-
ance and status. Here we consider two popular approaches to a complete ratio
analysis: (1) summarizing all ratios and (2) the DuPont system of analysis. The
summary analysis approach tends to view all aspects of the firm’s financial activi-
ties to isolate key areas of responsibility. The DuPont system acts as a search tech-
nique aimed at finding the key areas responsible for the firm’s financial condition.
SUMMARIZING ALL RATIOS
We can use Bartlett Company’s ratios to perform a complete ratio analysis using
both cross-sectional and time-series analysis approaches. The 2012 ratio values
calculated earlier and the ratio values calculated for 2010 and 2011 for Bartlett
Company, along with the industry average ratios for 2012, are summarized in
Table 3.8 (see pages 86 and 87), which also shows the formula used to calculate
each ratio. Using these data, we can discuss the five key aspects of Bartlett’s per-
formance—liquidity, activity, debt, profitability, and market.
Liquidity
The overall liquidity of the firm seems to exhibit a reasonably stable trend,
having been maintained at a level that is relatively consistent with the industry
average in 2012. The firm’s liquidity seems to be good.
Activity
Bartlett Company’s inventory appears to be in good shape. Its inventory manage-
ment seems to have improved, and in 2012 it performed at a level above that of
the industry. The firm may be experiencing some problems with accounts receiv-
able. The average collection period seems to have crept up above that of the
industry. Bartlett also appears to be slow in paying its bills; it pays nearly 30 days
slower than the industry average. This could adversely affect the firm’s credit
standing. Although overall liquidity appears to be good, the management of
receivables and payables should be examined. Bartlett’s total asset turnover
reflects a decline in the efficiency of total asset utilization between 2010 and 2011.
Although in 2012 it rose to a level considerably above the industry average, it
appears that the pre-2011 level of efficiency has not yet been achieved.
Debt
Bartlett Company’s indebtedness increased over the 2010–2012 period and is
currently above the industry average. Although this increase in the debt ratio
could be cause for alarm, the firm’s ability to meet interest and fixed-payment
obligations improved, from 2011 to 2012, to a level that outperforms the
industry. The firm’s increased indebtedness in 2011 apparently caused deteriora-
tion in its ability to pay debt adequately. However, Bartlett has evidently improved
its income in 2012 so that it is able to meet its interest and fixed-payment obliga-
tions at a level consistent with the average in the industry. In summary, it appears
that although 2011 was an off year, the company’s improved ability to pay debts
in 2012 compensates for its increased degree of indebtedness.

CHAPTER 3
Financial Statements and Ratio Analysis

Profitability
Bartlett’s profitability relative to sales in 2012 was better than the average com-
pany in the industry, although it did not match the firm’s 2010 performance.
Although the gross profit margin was better in 2011 and 2012 than in 2010,
higher levels of operating and interest expenses in 2011 and 2012 appear to have
caused the 2012 net profit margin to fall below that of 2010. However, Bartlett
Company’s 2012 net profit margin is quite favorable when compared to the
industry average.
The firm’s earnings per share, return on total assets, and return on common
equity behaved much as its net profit margin did over the 2010–2012 period.
Bartlett appears to have experienced either a sizable drop in sales between 2010
and 2011 or a rapid expansion in assets during that period. The exceptionally
high 2012 level of return on common equity suggests that the firm is performing
quite well. The firm’s above-average returns—net profit margin, EPS, ROA, and
ROE—may be attributable to the fact that it is more risky than average. A look
at market ratios is helpful in assessing risk.
Market
Investors have greater confidence in the firm in 2012 than in the prior 2 years, as
reflected in the price/earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.1. However, this ratio is below the
industry average. The P/E ratio suggests that the firm’s risk has declined but
remains above that of the average firm in its industry. The firm’s market/book
(M/B) ratio has increased over the 2010–2012 period, and in 2012 it exceeds the
industry average. This implies that investors are optimistic about the firm’s future
performance. The P/E and M/B ratios reflect the firm’s increased profitability
over the 2010–2012 period: Investors expect to earn high future returns as com-
pensation for the firm’s above-average risk.
In summary, the firm appears to be growing and has recently undergone an
expansion in assets, financed primarily through the use of debt. The 2011–2012
period seems to reflect a phase of adjustment and recovery from the rapid growth
in assets. Bartlett’s sales, profits, and other performance factors seem to be growing
with the increase in the size of the operation. In addition, the market response to
these accomplishments appears to have been positive. In short, the firm seems to
have done well in 2012.
DUPONT SYSTEM OF ANALYSIS
The DuPont system of analysis is used to dissect the firm’s financial statements
and to assess its financial condition. It merges the income statement and balance
sheet into two summary measures of profitability, return on total assets (ROA)
and return on common equity (ROE). Figure 3.2 (see page 88) depicts the basic
DuPont system with Bartlett Company’s 2012 monetary and ratio values. The
upper portion of the chart summarizes the income statement activities; the lower
portion summarizes the balance sheet activities.

DuPont System of Analysis
The DuPont system of analysis with application to Bartlett Company (2012)

efficiently the firm has used its assets to generate sales. In the DuPont formula,
the product of these two ratios results in the return on total assets (ROA):
Substituting the appropriate formulas into the equation and simplifying results in
the formula given earlier,
When the 2012 values of the net profit margin and total asset turnover for
Bartlett Company, calculated earlier, are substituted into the DuPont formula, the
result is
This value is the same as that calculated directly in an earlier section (page 81).
The DuPont formula enables the firm to break down its return into profit-on-
sales and efficiency-of-asset-use components. Typically, a firm with a low net
profit margin has a high total asset turnover, which results in a reasonably good
return on total assets. Often, the opposite situation exists.
Modified DuPont Formula
The second step in the DuPont system employs the modified DuPont formula.
This formula relates the firm’s return on total assets (ROA) to its return on
common equity (ROE). The latter is calculated by multiplying the return on total
assets (ROA) by the financial leverage multiplier (FLM), which is the ratio of
total assets to common stock equity:
Substituting the appropriate formulas into the equation and simplifying results in
the formula given earlier,
Use of the financial leverage multiplier (FLM) to convert the ROA into the
ROE reflects the impact of financial leverage on owners’ return. Substituting the
values for Bartlett Company’s ROA of 6.1 percent, calculated earlier, and
Bartlett’s FLM of 2.06 ($3,597,000 total assets
$1,754,000 common stock
equity) into the modified DuPont formula yields
The 12.6 percent ROE calculated by using the modified DuPont formula is the
same as that calculated directly (page 82).
Applying the DuPont System
The advantage of the DuPont system is that it allows the firm to break its return on
equity into a profit-on-sales component (net profit margin), an efficiency-of-asset-
use component (total asset turnover), and a use-of-financial-leverage component

DuPont formula
Multiplies the firm’s net profit
margin by its total asset
turnover to calculate the firm’s
return on total assets (ROA).
Matter of fact

R
eturn to Table 3.5, and
examine the total asset
turnover figures for Dell and
The Home Depot. Both firms
turn their assets 1.6 times per
year. Now look at the return
on assets column. Dell’s ROA
is 4.3 percent, but The Home
Depot’s is significantly higher
at 6.5 percent. If the two firms
are equal in terms of the effi-
ciency with which they
manage their assets (that is,
equal asset turns), why is The
Home Depot more profitable
relative to assets? The answer
lies in the DuPont formula.
Notice that Home Depot’s net
profit margin is 4.0 percent
compared to Dell’s 2.7 percent.
That drives the superior ROA
figures for The Home Depot.
modified DuPont formula
Relates the firm’s return on total
assets (ROA) to its return on
common equity (ROE) using the
financial leverage multiplier
(FLM).
financial leverage multiplier
(FLM)
The ratio of the firm’s total
assets to its common stock
equity.

(financial leverage multiplier). The total return to owners therefore can be ana-
lyzed in these important dimensions.
The use of the DuPont system of analysis as a diagnostic tool is best explained
using Figure 3.2. Beginning with the rightmost value—the ROE—the financial
analyst moves to the left, dissecting and analyzing the inputs to the formula to iso-
late the probable cause of the resulting above-average (or below-average) value.
For the sake of demonstration, let’s ignore all industry average data in Table 3.8
and assume that Bartlett’s ROE of 12.6% is actually below the industry average.
Moving to the left in Figure 3.2, we would examine the inputs to the ROE—the
ROA and the FLM—relative to the industry averages. Let’s assume that the FLM
is in line with the industry average, but the ROA is below the industry average.
Moving farther to the left, we examine the two inputs to the ROA—the net profit
margin and total asset turnover. Assume that the net profit margin is in line with
the industry average, but the total asset turnover is below the industry average.
Moving still farther to the left, we find that whereas the firm’s sales are consistent
with the industry value, Bartlett’s total assets have grown significantly during the
past year. Looking farther to the left, we would review the firm’s activity ratios for
current assets. Let’s say that whereas the firm’s inventory turnover is in line with the
industry average, its average collection period is well above the industry average.
We can readily trace the possible problem back to its cause: Bartlett’s low
ROE is primarily the consequence of slow collections of accounts receivable,
which resulted in high levels of receivables and therefore high levels of total
assets. The high total assets slowed Bartlett’s total asset turnover, driving down
its ROA, which then drove down its ROE. By using the DuPont system of
analysis to dissect Bartlett’s overall returns as measured by its ROE, we found
that slow collections of receivables caused the below-industry-average ROE.
Clearly, the firm needs to better manage its credit operations.

Summary
FOCUS ON VALUE
Financial managers review and analyze the firm’s financial statements periodi-
cally, both to uncover developing problems and to assess the firm’s progress
toward achieving its goals. These actions are aimed at preserving and creating
value for the firm’s owners. Financial ratios enable financial managers to mon-
itor the pulse of the firm and its progress toward its strategic goals. Although

financial statements and financial ratios rely on accrual concepts, they can pro-
vide useful insights into important aspects of risk and return (cash flow) that
affect share price.
REVIEW OF LEARNING GOALS
Review the contents of the stockholders’ report and the procedures for
consolidating international financial statements. The annual stockholders’
report, which publicly owned corporations must provide to stockholders, docu-
ments the firm’s financial activities of the past year. It includes the letter to stock-
holders and various subjective and factual information. It also contains four key
financial statements: the income statement, the balance sheet, the statement of
stockholders’ equity (or its abbreviated form, the statement of retained earnings),
and the statement of cash flows. Notes describing the technical aspects of the
financial statements follow. Financial statements of companies that have opera-
tions whose cash flows are denominated in one or more foreign currencies must
be translated into dollars in accordance with FASB Standard No. 52.
Understand who uses financial ratios and how. Ratio analysis enables
stockholders, lenders, and the firm’s managers to evaluate the firm’s financial
performance. It can be performed on a cross-sectional or a time-series basis.
Benchmarking is a popular type of cross-sectional analysis. Users of ratios
should understand the cautions that apply to their use.
Use ratios to analyze a firm’s liquidity and activity. Liquidity, or the
ability of the firm to pay its bills as they come due, can be measured by the cur-
rent ratio and the quick (acid-test) ratio. Activity ratios measure the speed with
which accounts are converted into sales or cash—inflows or outflows. The
activity of inventory can be measured by its turnover: that of accounts receiv-
able by the average collection period and that of accounts payable by the
average payment period. Total asset turnover measures the efficiency with which
the firm uses its assets to generate sales.
Discuss the relationship between debt and financial leverage and the
ratios used to analyze a firm’s debt. The more debt a firm uses, the greater its
financial leverage, which magnifies both risk and return. Financial debt ratios
measure both the degree of indebtedness and the ability to service debts. A
common measure of indebtedness is the debt ratio. The ability to pay fixed charges
can be measured by times interest earned and fixed-payment coverage ratios.
Use ratios to analyze a firm’s profitability and its market value. The
common-size income statement, which shows each item as a percentage of sales,
can be used to determine gross profit margin, operating profit margin, and net
profit margin. Other measures of profitability include earnings per share, return
on total assets, and return on common equity. Market ratios include the
price/earnings ratio and the market/book ratio.
Use a summary of financial ratios and the DuPont system of analysis to
perform a complete ratio analysis. A summary of all ratios can be used to perform
a complete ratio analysis using cross-sectional and time-series analysis. The

another on the basis of their ratios?
b. Why might the current and quick ratios for the electric utility and the fast-food
stock be so much lower than the same ratios for the other companies?
c. Why might it be all right for the electric utility to carry a large amount of debt,
but not the software company?

complete set of ratios for fiscal years 2011 and 2012. She will use them to look for
significant changes in the company’s situation from one year to the next.
LG 6
Analyze its overall financial situation from both a cross-sectional and a time-series
viewpoint. Break your analysis into evaluations of the firm’s liquidity, activity, debt,
profitability, and market.

a. To focus on the degree of change, calculate the year-to-year proportional change
by subtracting the year 2011 ratio from the year 2012 ratio, then dividing the
difference by the year 2011 ratio. Multiply the result by 100. Preserve the posi-
tive or negative sign. The result is the percentage change in the ratio from 2011
to 2012. Calculate the proportional change for the ratios shown here.
b. For any ratio that shows a year-to-year difference of 10% or more, state whether
the difference is in the company’s favor or not.
c. For the most significant changes (25% or more), look at the other ratios and cite
at least one other change that may have contributed to the change in the ratio
that you are discussing.

The income statement and balance sheet are the basic reports that a firm constructs for
use by management and for distribution to stockholders, regulatory bodies, and the
general public. They are the primary sources of historical financial information about
the firm. Dayton Products, Inc., is a moderate-sized manufacturer. The company’s
management has asked you to perform a detailed financial statement analysis of 
the firm.

The income statements for the years ending December 31, 2012 and 2011,
respectively, are presented in the table below. (Note: Purchases of inventory during
2012 amounted to $109,865.)

Why This Chapter Matters to You
In your professional life
ACCOUNTING You need to understand how depreciation is used for
both tax and financial reporting purposes; how to develop the state-
ment of cash flows; the primary focus on cash flows, rather than
accruals, in financial decision making; and how pro forma financial
statements are used within the firm.
INFORMATION SYSTEMS You need to understand the data that must
be kept to record depreciation for tax and financial reporting; the infor-
mation needed for strategic and operating plans; and what data are
needed as inputs for preparing cash plans and profit plans.
MANAGEMENT You need to understand the difference between
strategic and operating plans, and the role of each; the importance of
focusing on the firm’s cash flows; and how use of pro forma statements
can head off trouble for the firm.
MARKETING You need to understand the central role that marketing
plays in formulating the firm’s long-term strategic plans, and the impor-
tance of the sales forecast as the key input for both cash planning and
profit planning.
OPERATIONS You need to understand how depreciation affects the
value of the firm’s plant assets; how the results of operations are cap-
tured in the statement of cash flows; that operations provide key inputs
into the firm’s short-term financial plans; and the distinction between
fixed and variable operating costs.
Individuals, like corporations,
should focus on cash flow when
planning and monitoring finances. You should establish short- and long-
term financial goals (destinations) and develop personal financial plans
(road maps) that will guide their achievement. Cash flows and financial
plans are as important for individuals as for corporations.

Investors Want Apple to Take a Bite 
Out of Its Cash Hoard
M
any people would be surprised to learn that
U.S. firms emerged from the worst recession in
at least two decades with more cash on their balance
sheets than they had before the downturn hit. Non-
financial firms in the S&P 500 stock index ended
2009 with $832 billion in cash and short-term mar-
ketable securities on hand, an increase of more than
25 percent from 2008 and the highest figure on
record. Among the firms with the largest cash hoards were the titans of high technology—
Microsoft ($39.7 billion), Cisco Systems ($39.1 billion), Google ($26.5 billion), Oracle 
($17.5 billion), and Intel ($16.3 billion).
At the top of this list was Apple Inc., with $41.7 billion in cash in early 2010, equivalent
to roughly one-fifth of the firm’s total market value (or $40 of the $200 share price). Is holding
that much cash a good thing? Investors buy Apple shares because they believe that the company
will continue to produce great high-tech gadgets and generate high returns as a result, but the
money that Apple held in cash earned no more than 1 percent in 2010. Thus, some investors
complained that Apple should distribute a chunk of its cash via a large dividend or share repur-
chase program.
Steve Jobs, Apple’s CEO, responded that distributing cash would not have a lasting
impact on the firm’s value. Instead, he argued that billions in cash could be used to do “big,
bold things,” and he worried, “Who knows what’s around the next corner?” The latter statement
may be the most revealing for Apple and the other high-tech firms. Having survived a recession
in which cash was hard to come by, many executives appeared to be taking a very conserva-
tive posture and holding on to as much cash as they could—just in case.

CHAPTER 4
Cash Flow and Financial Planning
115
4.1 Analyzing the Firm’s Cash Flow
An old saying in finance is “Cash is king.” Cash flow, the lifeblood of the firm, is
the primary ingredient in any financial valuation model. Whether an analyst wants
to put a value on an investment that a firm is considering or the objective is to value
the firm itself, estimating cash flow is central to the valuation process. This chapter
explains where the cash flow numbers used in valuations come from.
DEPRECIATION
For tax and financial reporting purposes, businesses generally cannot deduct as
an expense the full cost of an asset that will be in use for several years. Instead,
each year firms are required to charge a portion of the costs of fixed assets
against revenues. This allocation of historical cost over time is called
depreciation. Depreciation deductions, like any other business expenses, reduce
the income that a firm reports on its income statement and therefore reduce the
taxes that the firm must pay. However, depreciation deductions are not associ-
ated with any cash outlay. That is, when a firm deducts depreciation expense, it is
allocating a portion of an asset’s original cost (that the firm has already paid for)
as a charge against that year’s income. The net effect is that depreciation deduc-
tions increase a firm’s cash flow because they reduce a firm’s tax bill.
For tax purposes, the depreciation of business assets is regulated by the
Internal Revenue Code. Because the objectives of financial reporting sometimes
differ from those of tax legislation, firms often use different depreciation methods
for financial reporting than those required for tax purposes. Keeping two dif-
ferent sets of records for these two purposes is legal in the United States.
Depreciation for tax purposes is determined by using the modified acceler-
ated cost recovery system (MACRS); a variety of depreciation methods are avail-
able for financial reporting purposes. All depreciation methods require you to
know an asset’s depreciable value and its depreciable life.
Depreciable Value of an Asset
Under the basic MACRS procedures, the depreciable value of an asset (the
amount to be depreciated) is its full cost, including outlays for installation. Even
if the asset is expected to have some salvage value at the end of its useful life, the
firm can still take depreciation deductions equal to the asset’s full initial cost.
Baker Corporation acquired a new machine at a cost of $38,000, with installa-
tion costs of $2,000. When the machine is retired from service, Baker expects to
sell it for scrap metal and receive $1,000. Regardless of its expected salvage
value, the depreciable value of the machine is $40,000: $38,000 cost
$2,000
installation cost.
Depreciable Life of an Asset
The time period over which an asset is depreciated is called its depreciable life.
The shorter the depreciable life, the larger the annual depreciation deductions

will be, and the larger will be the tax savings associated with those deductions, all
other things being equal. Accordingly, firms generally would like to depreciate
their assets as rapidly as possible. However, the firm must abide by certain
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requirements for determining depreciable life.
These MACRS standards, which apply to both new and used assets, require the
taxpayer to use as an asset’s depreciable life the appropriate MACRS recovery
period. There are six MACRS recovery periods—3, 5, 7, 10, 15, and 20 years—
excluding real estate. It is customary to refer to the property classes as 3-, 5-, 7-,
10-, 15-, and 20-year property. The first four property classes—those routinely
used by business—are defined in Table 4.1.
DEPRECIATION METHODS
For financial reporting purposes, companies can use a variety of depreciation
methods (straight-line, double-declining balance, and sum-of-the-years’-digits).
For tax purposes, assets in the first four MACRS property classes are depreciated
by the double-declining balance method, using a half-year convention (meaning
that a half-year’s depreciation is taken in the year the asset is purchased) and
switching to straight-line when advantageous. The approximate percentages
(rounded to the nearest whole percent) written off each year for the first four
property classes are shown in Table 4.2. Rather than using the percentages in the
table, the firm can either use straight-line depreciation over the asset’s recovery
period with the half-year convention or use the alternative depreciation system.
For purposes of this text, we will use the MACRS depreciation percentages
because they generally provide for the fastest write-off and therefore the best cash
flow effects for the profitable firm.
Because MACRS requires use of the half-year convention, assets are assumed
to be acquired in the middle of the year; therefore, only one-half of the first year’s
depreciation is recovered in the first year. As a result, the final half-year of depre-
ciation is recovered in the year immediately following the asset’s stated recovery
period. In Table 4.2, the depreciation percentages for an n-year class asset are
given for 
years. For example, a 5-year asset is depreciated over 6 recovery
years. The application of the tax depreciation percentages given in Table 4.2 can
be demonstrated by a simple example.

DEVELOPING THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS
The statement of cash flows, introduced in Chapter 3, summarizes the firm’s cash
flow over a given period. Keep in mind that analysts typically lump cash and

marketable securities together when assessing the firm’s liquidity because both
cash and marketable securities represent a reservoir of liquidity. That reservoir is
increased by cash inflows and decreased by cash outflows.
Also note that the firm’s cash flows fall into three categories: (1) operating
flows, (2) investment flows, and (3) financing flows. The operating flows are cash
inflows and outflows directly related to the sale and production of the firm’s
products and services. Investment flows are cash flows associated with the pur-
chase and sale of both fixed assets and equity investments in other firms. Clearly,
purchase transactions would result in cash outflows, whereas sales transactions
would generate cash inflows. The financing flows result from debt and equity
financing transactions. Incurring either short-term or long-term debt would result
in a corresponding cash inflow; repaying debt would result in an outflow.
Similarly, the sale of the company’s stock would result in a cash inflow; the repur-
chase of stock or payment of cash dividends would result in an outflow.
Classifying Inflows and Outflows of Cash
The statement of cash flows, in effect, summarizes the inflows and outflows of
cash during a given period. Table 4.3 classifies the basic inflows (sources) and
outflows (uses) of cash. For example, if a firm’s accounts payable balance
increased by $1,000 during the year, the change would be an inflow of cash. The
change would be an outflow of cash if the firm’s inventory increased by $2,500.
A few additional points can be made with respect to the classification scheme
in Table 4.3:
1. A decrease in an asset, such as the firm’s cash balance, is an inflow of cash.
Why? Because cash that has been tied up in the asset is released and can be
used for some other purpose, such as repaying a loan. On the other hand, an
increase in the firm’s cash balance is an outflow of cash because additional
cash is being tied up in the firm’s cash balance.
The classification of decreases and increases in a firm’s cash balance is
difficult for many to grasp. To clarify, imagine that you store all your cash in
a bucket. Your cash balance is represented by the amount of cash in the
bucket. When you need cash, you withdraw it from the bucket, which
decreases your cash balance and provides an inflow of cash to you.
Conversely, when you have excess cash, you deposit it in the bucket, which
increases your cash balance and represents an outflow of cash from you.
Focus on the movement of funds in and out of your pocket: Clearly, a
decrease in cash (from the bucket) is an inflow (to your pocket); an increase
in cash (in the bucket) is an outflow (from your pocket).

n its 2009 annual report,
Apple reported over 
$10 billion in cash from its
operating activities. In the same
year, Apple used $17.4 billion
in cash to invest in marketable
securities and other invest-
ments. By comparison, its
financing cash flows were
negligible, resulting in a cash
inflow of about $663 million,
mostly from stock issued to
employees as part of Apple’s
compensation plans.

TABLE 4.3

2. Depreciation (like amortization and depletion) is a noncash charge—an
expense that is deducted on the income statement but does not involve an
actual outlay of cash. Therefore, when measuring the amount of cash flow
generated by a firm, we have to add depreciation back to net income or we
will understate the cash that the firm has truly generated. For this reason,
depreciation appears as a source of cash in Table 4.3.
3. Because depreciation is treated as a separate cash inflow, only gross rather
than net changes in fixed assets appear on the statement of cash flows. The
change in net fixed assets is equal to the change in gross fixed assets minus
the depreciation charge. Therefore, if we treated depreciation as a cash inflow
as well as the reduction in net (rather than gross) fixed assets, we would be
double counting depreciation.
4. Direct entries of changes in retained earnings are not included on the state-
ment of cash flows. Instead, entries for items that affect retained earnings
appear as net profits or losses after taxes and dividends paid.
Preparing the Statement of Cash Flows
The statement of cash flows uses data from the income statement, along with the
beginning- and end-of-period balance sheets. The income statement for the year
ended December 31, 2012, and the December 31 balance sheets for 2011 and
2012 for Baker Corporation are given in Tables 4.4 and 4.5 (see page 120), respec-
tively. The statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2012, for Baker
Corporation is presented in Table 4.6 (see page 121). Note that all cash inflows as
well as net profits after taxes and depreciation are treated as positive values.

All cash outflows, any losses, and dividends paid are treated as negative values.
The items in each category—operating, investment, and financing—are totaled,
and the three totals are added to get the “Net increase (decrease) in cash and mar-
ketable securities” for the period. As a check, this value should reconcile with the
actual change in cash and marketable securities for the year, which is obtained
from the beginning- and end-of-period balance sheets.
Interpreting the Statement
The statement of cash flows allows the financial manager and other interested
parties to analyze the firm’s cash flow. The manager should pay special attention
both to the major categories of cash flow and to the individual items of cash
inflow and outflow, to assess whether any developments have occurred that are
contrary to the company’s financial policies. In addition, the statement can be
used to evaluate progress toward projected goals or to isolate inefficiencies. The

projected financial statements to determine whether planned actions are desirable
in view of the resulting cash flows.
Operating Cash Flow
A firm’s operating cash flow (OCF) is the cash flow it
generates from its normal operations—producing and selling its output of goods
or services. A variety of definitions of OCF can be found in the financial litera-
ture. The definition introduced here excludes the impact of interest on cash flow.
We exclude those effects because we want a measure that captures the cash flow
generated by the firm’s operations, not by how those operations are financed and
taxed. The first step is to calculate net operating profits after taxes (NOPAT),
which represent the firm’s earnings before interest and after taxes. Letting T
equal the applicable corporate tax rate, NOPAT is calculated as follows:
(4.1)
To convert NOPAT to operating cash flow (OCF), we merely add back
depreciation:
(4.2)
OCF = NOPAT + Depreciation
NOPAT = EBIT * (1 - T)

4.4) into Equation 4.3, we get
During 2012, Baker Corporation generated $322,000 of cash flow from pro-
ducing and selling its output. Therefore, we can conclude that Baker’s operations
are generating positive cash flows.
FREE CASH FLOW
The firm’s free cash flow (FCF) represents the cash available to investors—the
providers of debt (creditors) and equity (owners)—after the firm has met all oper-
ating needs and paid for net investments in fixed assets and current assets. Free
cash flow can be defined as follows:
(4.4)
The net fixed asset investment (NFAI) is the net investment that the firm
makes in fixed assets and refers to purchases minus sales of fixed assets. You can
calculate the NFAI using Equation 4.5.
(4.5)
The NFAI is also equal to the change in gross fixed assets from one year to the
next.
Using the Baker Corporation’s balance sheets in Table 4.5, we see that its change in
net fixed assets between 2011 and 2012 was $200 ($1,200 in 2012
$1,000 in
2011). Substituting this value and the $100 of depreciation for 2012 into Equation
4.5, we get Baker’s net fixed asset investment (NFAI) for 2012:
Baker Corporation therefore invested a net $300,000 in fixed assets during 2012.
This amount would, of course, represent a cash outflow to acquire fixed assets
during 2012.
Looking at Equation 4.5, we can see that if net fixed assets decline by an amount
exceeding the depreciation for the period, the NFAI would be negative. A nega-
tive NFAI represents a net cash inflow attributable to the fact that the firm sold
more assets than it acquired during the year.
The net current asset investment (NCAI) represents the net investment made
by the firm in its current (operating) assets. “Net” refers to the difference between
current assets and the sum of accounts payable and accruals. Notes payable are
NFAI = $200 + $100 = $300
-

Example 4.4 3
NFAI = Change in net fixed assets + Depreciation
- Net current asset investment (NCAI)
FCF = OCF - Net fixed asset investment (NFAI)
OCF = 3$370 * (1.00 - 0.40)] + $100 = $222 + $100 = $322
Example 4.3 3
OCF = 3EBIT * (1 - T)4 + Depreciation

not included in the NCAI calculation because they represent a negotiated creditor
claim on the firm’s free cash flow. Equation 4.6 shows the NCAI calculation:
(4.6)
Looking at the Baker Corporation’s balance sheets for 2011 and 2012 in Table
4.5, we see that the change in current assets between 2011 and 2012 is 
$100
($2,000 in 2012
$1,900 in 2011). The difference between Baker’s accounts
payable plus accruals of $800 in 2012 ($700 in accounts payable
$100 in
accruals) and of $700 in 2011 ($500 in accounts payable
$200 in accruals) is 
$100 ($800 in 2012
$700 in 2011). Substituting into Equation 4.6 the
change in current assets and the change in the sum of accounts payable plus
accruals for Baker Corporation, we get its 2012 NCAI:
This means that during 2012 Baker Corporation made no investment ($0) in its
current assets net of accounts payable and accruals.
Now we can substitute Baker Corporation’s 2012 operating cash flow (OCF)
of $322, its net fixed asset investment (NFAI) of $300, and its net current asset
investment (NCAI) of $0 into Equation 4.4 to find its free cash flow (FCF):
We can see that during 2012 Baker generated $22,000 of free cash flow, which it
can use to pay its investors—creditors (payment of interest) and owners (payment
of dividends). Thus, the firm generated adequate cash flow to cover all of its
operating costs and investments and had free cash flow available to pay investors.
However, Baker’s interest expense in 2012 was $70,000, so the firm is not gener-
ating enough FCF to provide a sufficient return to its investors.
Clearly, cash flow is the lifeblood of the firm. The Focus on Practice box dis-
cusses Cisco System’s free cash flow.

4.2 The Financial Planning Process
Financial planning is an important aspect of the firm’s operations because it pro-
vides road maps for guiding, coordinating, and controlling the firm’s actions to
achieve its objectives. Two key aspects of the financial planning process are cash
planning and profit planning. Cash planning involves preparation of the firm’s
cash budget. Profit planning involves preparation of pro forma statements. Both
the cash budget and the pro forma statements are useful for internal financial
planning. They also are routinely required by existing and prospective lenders.
The financial planning process begins with long-term, or strategic, financial
plans. These, in turn, guide the formulation of short-term, or operating, plans
and budgets. Generally, the short-term plans and budgets implement the firm’s
long-term strategic objectives. Although the remainder of this chapter places pri-
mary emphasis on short-term financial plans and budgets, a few preliminary
comments on long-term financial plans are in order.
LONG-TERM (STRATEGIC) FINANCIAL PLANS
Long-term (strategic) financial plans lay out a company’s planned financial
actions and the anticipated impact of those actions over periods ranging from 
2 to 10 years. Five-year strategic plans, which are revised as significant new infor-
mation becomes available, are common. Generally, firms that are subject to high
degrees of operating uncertainty, relatively short production cycles, or both, tend
to use shorter planning horizons.

LG 3

Long-term financial plans are part of an integrated strategy that, along with
production and marketing plans, guides the firm toward strategic goals. Those long-
term plans consider proposed outlays for fixed assets, research and development
activities, marketing and product development actions, capital structure, and major
sources of financing. Also included would be termination of existing projects,
product lines, or lines of business; repayment or retirement of outstanding debts;
and any planned acquisitions. Such plans tend to be supported by a series of annual
budgets. The Focus on Ethics box shows how one CEO dramatically reshaped his
company’s operating structure, although it later cost him his job.
SHORT-TERM (OPERATING) FINANCIAL PLANS
Short-term (operating) financial plans specify short-term financial actions and the
anticipated impact of those actions. These plans most often cover a 1- to 2-year
period. Key inputs include the sales forecast and various forms of operating and
financial data. Key outputs include a number of operating budgets, the cash
budget, and pro forma financial statements. The entire short-term financial plan-
ning process is outlined in Figure 4.1 on page 126. Here we focus solely on cash
and profit planning from the financial manager’s perspective.

How Much Is a CEO Worth?
When Jack Welch
retired as chairman
and CEO of General Electric in 2000,
Robert L. Nardelli was part of a lengthy
and well-publicized succession plan-
ning saga; he eventually lost the job to
Jeff Immelt. Nardelli was quickly hired
by The Home Depot, one of several
companies competing for his services,
who offered generous incentives for
him to come on board.
Using the “Six Sigma” management
strategy from GE, Nardelli dramatically
overhauled The Home Depot and
replaced its freewheeling entrepre-
neurial culture. He changed the de-
centralized management structure by
eliminating and consolidating division
executives. He also installed processes
and streamlined operations, most
notably implementing a computerized
automated inventory system and central-
izing supply orders at the Atlanta head-
quarters. Nardelli was credited with
doubling the sales of the chain and
improving its competitive position.
Revenue increased from $45.7 billion
in 2000 to $81.5 billion in 2005,
while profit rose from $2.6 billion to
$5.8 billion.
However, the company’s stagnating
share price; Nardelli’s results-driven
management style, which turned off
both employees and customers; and his
compensation package eventually
earned the ire of investors. Despite 
having received the solid support of
The Home Depot’s board of directors,
Nardelli abruptly resigned on January
3, 2007. He was not destined for
poverty, as his severance package had
been negotiated years earlier when he
joined The Home Depot. The total sev-
erance package amounted to $210
million, including $55.3 million of life
insurance coverage, reimbursement of
$1.3 million of Nardelli’s personal
taxes related to the life insurance,
$50,000 to cover his legal fees,
$33.8 million in cash due July 3,
2007, an additional $18 million over
4 years for abiding by the terms of the
deal, and the balance of the package
from accelerated vesting of stock
options. In addition, Nardelli and his
family would receive health care bene-
fits from the company for the next 
3 years.
The mammoth payoff for Nardelli’s
departure caused uproar among many
shareholder activists because The Home
Depot’s stock fell 8 percent during his 
6-year tenure. Clearly, the mantra of
shareholder activists today is, “Ask not
what you can do for your company, ask
what your company can do for share-
holders.” The spotlight will no longer be
only on what a CEO does, but also on
how much the CEO is paid.

Nardelli’s severance package had

much better under his leadership?
in practice
short-term (operating)
financial plans
Specify short-term financial
actions and the anticipated
impact of those actions.

Short-term financial planning begins with the sales forecast. From it, compa-
nies develop production plans that take into account lead (preparation) times and
include estimates of the required raw materials. Using the production plans, the
firm can estimate direct labor requirements, factory overhead outlays, and oper-
ating expenses. Once these estimates have been made, the firm can prepare a pro
forma income statement and cash budget. With these basic inputs, the firm can
finally develop a pro forma balance sheet.
The first step in personal financial planning requires you to
define your goals. Whereas in a corporation, the goal is to max-
imize owner wealth (that is, share price), individuals typically have a number of
major goals.
Generally personal goals can be short-term (1 year), intermediate-term (2 to
5 years), or long-term (6 or more years). The short- and intermediate-term goals
support the long-term goals. Clearly, types of long-term personal goals depend on
the individual’s or family’s age, and goals will continue to change with one’s life
situation.
You should set your personal financial goals carefully and realistically. Each
goal should be clearly defined and have a priority, time frame, and cost estimate.
For example, a college senior’s intermediate-term goal in 2012 might include
earning a master’s degree at a cost of $40,000 by 2014, and his or her long-term
goal might be to buy a condominium at a cost of $125,000 by 2016.
Throughout the remainder of this chapter, we will concentrate on the key
outputs of the short-term financial planning process: the cash budget, the pro
forma income statement, and the pro forma balance sheet.

Cash Flow and Financial Planning

4.3 Cash Planning: Cash Budgets
The cash budget, or cash forecast, is a statement of the firm’s planned inflows and
outflows of cash. It is used by the firm to estimate its short-term cash require-
ments, with particular attention being paid to planning for surplus cash and for
cash shortages.
Typically, the cash budget is designed to cover a 1-year period, divided into
smaller time intervals. The number and type of intervals depend on the nature of
the business. The more seasonal and uncertain a firm’s cash flows, the greater the
number of intervals. Because many firms are confronted with a seasonal cash
flow pattern, the cash budget is quite often presented on a monthly basis. Firms
with stable patterns of cash flow may use quarterly or annual time intervals.
THE SALES FORECAST
The key input to the short-term financial planning process is the firm’s sales fore-
cast. This prediction of the firm’s sales over a given period is ordinarily prepared
by the marketing department. On the basis of the sales forecast, the financial
manager estimates the monthly cash flows that will result from projected sales
and from outlays related to production, inventory, and sales. The manager also
determines the level of fixed assets required and the amount of financing, if any,
needed to support the forecast level of sales and production. In practice,
obtaining good data is the most difficult aspect of forecasting. The sales forecast
may be based on an analysis of external data, internal data, or a combination of
the two.
An external forecast is based on the relationships observed between the firm’s
sales and certain key external economic indicators such as the gross domestic
product (GDP), new housing starts, consumer confidence, and disposable per-
sonal income. Forecasts containing these indicators are readily available.
Internal forecasts are based on a consensus of sales forecasts through the
firm’s own sales channels. Typically, the firm’s salespeople in the field are asked to
estimate how many units of each type of product they expect to sell in the coming
year. These forecasts are collected and totaled by the sales manager, who may
adjust the figures using knowledge of specific markets or of the salesperson’s
forecasting ability. Finally, adjustments may be made for additional internal fac-
tors, such as production capabilities.
Firms generally use a combination of external and internal forecast data to
make the final sales forecast. The internal data provide insight into sales expecta-
tions, and the external data provide a means of adjusting these expectations to
take into account general economic factors. The nature of the firm’s product also
often affects the mix and types of forecasting methods used.

PREPARING THE CASH BUDGET
The general format of the cash budget is presented in Table 4.7. We will discuss
each of its components individually.
Cash Receipts
Cash receipts include all of a firm’s inflows of cash during a given financial
period. The most common components of cash receipts are cash sales, collections
of accounts receivable, and other cash receipts.
Coulson Industries, a defense contractor, is developing a cash budget for October,
November, and December. Coulson’s sales in August and September were $100,000
and $200,000, respectively. Sales of $400,000, $300,000, and $200,000 have been
forecast for October, November, and December, respectively. Historically, 20% of
the firm’s sales have been for cash, 50% have generated accounts receivable col-
lected after 1 month, and the remaining 30% have generated accounts receivable
collected after 2 months. Bad-debt expenses (uncollectible accounts) have been neg-
ligible. In December, the firm will receive a $30,000 dividend from stock in a sub-
sidiary. The schedule of expected cash receipts for the company is presented in
Table 4.8. It contains the following items:
Forecast sales
This initial entry is merely informational. It is provided as an
aid in calculating other sales-related items.
Cash sales
The cash sales shown for each month represent 20% of the total
sales forecast for that month.
Collections of A/R
These entries represent the collection of accounts receiv-
able (A/R) resulting from sales in earlier months.
Lagged 1 month
These figures represent sales made in the preceding
month that generated accounts receivable collected in the current month.
Because 50% of the current month’s sales are collected 1 month later, the col-
lections of A/R with a 1-month lag shown for September represent 50% of
the sales in August, collections for October represent 50% of September
sales, and so on.

Lagged 2 months
These figures represent sales made 2 months earlier
that generated accounts receivable collected in the current month. Because
30% of sales are collected 2 months later, the collections with a 2-month lag
shown for October represent 30% of the sales in August, and so on.
Other cash receipts
These are cash receipts expected from sources other
than sales. Interest received, dividends received, proceeds from the sale of
equipment, stock and bond sale proceeds, and lease receipts may show up
here. For Coulson Industries, the only other cash receipt is the $30,000 divi-
dend due in December.
Total cash receipts
This figure represents the total of all the cash receipts
listed for each month. For Coulson Industries, we are concerned only with
October, November, and December, as shown in Table 4.8.
Cash Disbursements
Cash disbursements include all outlays of cash by the firm during a given finan-
cial period. The most common cash disbursements are
Cash purchases
Fixed-asset outlays
Payments of accounts payable
Interest payments
Rent (and lease) payments
Cash dividend payments
Wages and salaries
Principal payments (loans)
Tax payments
Repurchases or retirements of stock
It is important to recognize that depreciation and other noncash charges are
NOT included in the cash budget, because they merely represent a scheduled
write-off of an earlier cash outflow. The impact of depreciation, as we noted ear-
lier, is reflected in the reduced cash outflow for tax payments.
Coulson Industries has gathered the following data needed for the preparation of
a cash disbursements schedule for October, November, and December.
Purchases
The firm’s purchases represent 70% of sales. Of this amount,
10% is paid in cash, 70% is paid in the month immediately following the
month of purchase, and the remaining 20% is paid 2 months following 
the month of purchase.

These figures represent purchases made 2 months ear-

chases are paid for 2 months later, the payments with a 2-month lag for
October represent 20% of the August purchases, and so on.
Wages and salaries
These amounts were obtained by adding $8,000 to 10%
of the sales in each month. The $8,000 represents the salary component; the
rest represents wages.
The remaining items on the cash disbursements schedule are self-explanatory.
Net Cash Flow, Ending Cash, Financing, and Excess Cash
Look back at the general-format cash budget in Table 4.7 on page 128. We have
inputs for the first two entries, and we now continue calculating the firm’s cash
needs. The firm’s net cash flow is found by subtracting the cash disbursements
from cash receipts in each period. Then we add beginning cash to the firm’s net
cash flow to determine the ending cash for each period.
Finally, we subtract the desired minimum cash balance from ending cash to
find the required total financing or the excess cash balance. If the ending cash is
less than the minimum cash balance, financing is required. Such financing is typ-
ically viewed as short-term and is therefore represented by notes payable. If the
ending cash is greater than the minimum cash balance, excess cash exists. Any
excess cash is assumed to be invested in a liquid, short-term, interest-paying
vehicle—that is, in marketable securities.
Table 4.10 presents Coulson Industries’ cash budget. The company wishes to
maintain, as a reserve for unexpected needs, a minimum cash balance of $25,000.
For Coulson Industries to maintain its required $25,000 ending cash balance, it
will need total borrowing of $76,000 in November and $41,000 in December. In
October the firm will have an excess cash balance of $22,000, which can be held

in an interest-earning marketable security. The required total financing figures in
the cash budget refer to how much will be owed at the end of the month; they do
not represent the monthly changes in borrowing.
The monthly changes in borrowing and in excess cash can be found by fur-
ther analyzing the cash budget. In October the $50,000 beginning cash, which
becomes $47,000 after the $3,000 net cash outflow, results in a $22,000 excess
cash balance once the $25,000 minimum cash is deducted. In November the
$76,000 of required total financing resulted from the $98,000 net cash outflow
less the $22,000 of excess cash from October. The $41,000 of required total
financing in December resulted from reducing November’s $76,000 of required
total financing by the $35,000 of net cash inflow during December. Summarizing,
the financial activities for each month would be as follows:
October:
Invest the $22,000 excess cash balance in marketable securities.
November:
Liquidate the $22,000 of marketable securities and borrow
$76,000 (notes payable).
December:
Repay $35,000 of notes payable to leave $41,000 of out-
standing required total financing.
EVALUATING THE CASH BUDGET
The cash budget indicates whether a cash shortage or surplus is expected in each
of the months covered by the forecast. Each month’s figure is based on the inter-
nally imposed requirement of a minimum cash balance and represents the total
balance at the end of the month.
At the end of each of the 3 months, Coulson expects the following balances
in cash, marketable securities, and notes payable:

Note that the firm is assumed first to liquidate its marketable securities to meet
deficits and then to borrow with notes payable if additional financing is needed.
As a result, it will not have marketable securities and notes payable on its books
at the same time. Because it may be necessary to borrow up to $76,000 for the 
3-month period, the financial manager should be certain that some arrangement
is made to ensure the availability of these funds.
Because individuals receive only a finite amount of income
(cash inflow) during a given period, they need to prepare
budgets to make sure they can cover their expenses (cash outflows) during the
period. The personal budget is a short-term financial planning report that helps
individuals or families achieve short-term financial goals. Personal budgets typi-
cally cover a 1-year period, broken into months.

The personal budget shows a cash surplus of $749 in January followed by
monthly deficits in February and March of $516 and $2,531, resulting in a cumu-
lative deficit of $2,298 through March. Clearly, to cover the deficit, some
action—such as increasing income, reducing expenses, drawing down savings, or
borrowing—will be necessary to bring the budget into balance. Borrowing by
using credit can offset a deficit in the short term but can lead to financial trouble
if done repeatedly.
COPING WITH UNCERTAINTY IN THE CASH BUDGET
Aside from careful estimation of cash budget inputs, there are two ways of
coping with uncertainty in the cash budget. One is to prepare several cash
budgets—based on pessimistic, most likely, and optimistic forecasts. From this
range of cash flows, the financial manager can determine the amount of
financing necessary to cover the most adverse situation. The use of several cash
budgets, based on differing scenarios, also should give the financial manager a
sense of the riskiness of the various alternatives. This scenario analysis, or “what
if” approach, is often used to analyze cash flows under a variety of circum-
stances. Clearly, the use of electronic spreadsheets simplifies the process of per-
forming scenario analysis.
Table 4.11 presents the summary of Coulson Industries’ cash budget prepared for
each month using pessimistic, most likely, and optimistic estimates of total cash
receipts and disbursements. The most likely estimate is based on the expected
outcomes presented earlier.
During October, Coulson will, at worst, need a maximum of $15,000 of
financing and, at best, will have a $62,000 excess cash balance. During
November, its financing requirement will be between $0 and $185,000, or it
could experience an excess cash balance of $5,000. The December projections
show maximum borrowing of $190,000 with a possible excess cash balance of
$107,000. By considering the extreme values in the pessimistic and optimistic
Example 4.11 3

outcomes, Coulson Industries should be better able to plan its cash requirements.
For the 3-month period, the peak borrowing requirement under the worst cir-
cumstances would be $190,000, which happens to be considerably greater than
the most likely estimate of $76,000 for this period.
A second and much more sophisticated way of coping with uncertainty in the
cash budget is simulation (discussed in Chapter 12). By simulating the occurrence
of sales and other uncertain events, the firm can develop a probability distribu-
tion of its ending cash flows for each month. The financial decision maker can
then use the probability distribution to determine the amount of financing needed
to protect the firm adequately against a cash shortage.
CASH FLOW WITHIN THE MONTH
Because the cash budget shows cash flows only on a total monthly basis, the
information provided by the cash budget is not necessarily adequate for ensuring
solvency. A firm must look more closely at its pattern of daily cash receipts and
cash disbursements to ensure that adequate cash is available for paying bills as
they come due.
The synchronization of cash flows in the cash budget at month-end does not
ensure that the firm will be able to meet its daily cash requirements. Because a
firm’s cash flows are generally quite variable when viewed on a daily basis, effec-
tive cash planning requires a look beyond the cash budget. The financial manager
must therefore plan and monitor cash flow more frequently than on a monthly
basis. The greater the variability of cash flows from day to day, the greater the
amount of attention required.

4.4 Profit Planning: Pro Forma Statements
Whereas cash planning focuses on forecasting cash flows, profit planning relies on
accrual concepts to project the firm’s profit and overall financial position.
Shareholders, creditors, and the firm’s management pay close attention to the 
pro forma statements which are projected income statements and balance sheets.
The basic steps in the short-term financial planning process were shown in the flow
diagram of Figure 4.1. The approaches for estimating the pro forma statements are
all based on the belief that the financial relationships reflected in the firm’s past
financial statements will not change in the coming period. The commonly used sim-
plified approaches are presented in subsequent discussions.
Two inputs are required for preparing pro forma statements: (1) financial
statements for the preceding year and (2) the sales forecast for the coming year. 
A variety of assumptions must also be made. The company that we will use to illus-
trate the simplified approaches to pro forma preparation is Vectra Manufacturing,
which manufactures and sells one product. It has two basic product models, X
and Y, which are produced by the same process but require different amounts of
raw material and labor.
PRECEDING YEAR’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The income statement for the firm’s 2012 operations is given in Table 4.12 on page
136. It indicates that Vectra had sales of $100,000, total cost of goods sold of
$80,000, net profits before taxes of $9,000, and net profits after taxes of $7,650.
The firm paid $4,000 in cash dividends, leaving $3,650 to be transferred to retained
earnings. The firm’s balance sheet for 2012 is given in Table 4.13 on page 136.
SALES FORECAST
Just as for the cash budget, the key input for pro forma statements is the sales
forecast. Vectra Manufacturing’s sales forecast for the coming year (2013), based
on both external and internal data, is presented in Table 4.14 on page 136. The
unit sale prices of the products reflect an increase from $20 to $25 for model X and
from $40 to $50 for model Y. These increases are necessary to cover anticipated
increases in costs.

4.5 Preparing the Pro Forma Income Statement
A simple method for developing a pro forma income statement is the percent-of-sales
method. It forecasts sales and then expresses the various income statement items as
percentages of projected sales. The percentages used are likely to be the percentages
of sales for those items in the previous year. By using dollar values taken from
Vectra’s 2012 income statement (Table 4.12), we find that these percentages are
Applying these percentages to the firm’s forecast sales of $135,000 (developed in
Table 4.14), we get the 2013 pro forma income statement shown in Table 4.15.
We have assumed that Vectra will pay $4,000 in common stock dividends, so the
expected contribution to retained earnings is $6,327. This represents a consider-
able increase over $3,650 in the preceding year (see Table 4.12).
CONSIDERING TYPES OF COSTS AND EXPENSES
The technique that is used to prepare the pro forma income statement in Table
4.15 assumes that all the firm’s costs and expenses are variable. That is, for a
given percentage increase in sales, the same percentage increase in cost of goods
sold, operating expenses, and interest expense would result. For example, as
Vectra’s sales increased by 35 percent, we assumed that its costs of goods sold
also increased by 35 percent. On the basis of this assumption, the firm’s net
profits before taxes also increased by 35 percent.

Because this approach assumes that all costs are variable, it may understate
the increase in profits that will occur when sales increase if some of the firm’s
costs are fixed. Similarly, if sales decline, the percentage-of-sales method may
overstate profits if some costs are fixed and do not fall when revenues decline.
Therefore, a pro forma income statement constructed using the percentage-of-
sales method generally tends to understate profits when sales are increasing and
overstate profits when sales are decreasing. The best way to adjust for the pres-
ence of fixed costs when preparing a pro forma income statement is to break the
firm’s historical costs and expenses into fixed and variable components. The
potential returns as well as risks resulting from use of fixed (operating and finan-
cial) costs to create “leverage” are discussed in Chapter 13. The key point to rec-
ognize here is that fixed costs make a firm’s profits more variable than its
revenues. That is, when both profits and sales are rising, profits tend to increase
at a faster rate, but when profits and sales are in decline, the percentage drop in
profits is often greater than the rate of decline in sales.
Vectra Manufacturing’s 2012 actual and 2013 pro forma income statements,
broken into fixed and variable cost and expense components, follow:

Breaking Vectra’s costs and expenses into fixed and variable components
provides a more accurate projection of its pro forma profit. By assuming that all
costs are variable (as shown in Table 4.15), we find that projected net profits
before taxes would continue to equal 9% of sales (in 2012, $9,000 net profits
before taxes
$100,000 sales). Therefore, the 2013 net profits before taxes
would have been $12,150 (0.09
$135,000 projected sales) instead of the
$28,250 obtained by using the firm’s fixed-cost–variable-cost breakdown.
Clearly, when using a simplified approach to prepare a pro forma income
statement, we should break down costs and expenses into fixed and variable
components.

4.6 Preparing the Pro Forma Balance Sheet
A number of simplified approaches are available for preparing the pro forma bal-
ance sheet. One involves estimating all balance sheet accounts as a strict per-
centage of sales. A better and more popular approach is the judgmental approach,
under which the firm estimates the values of certain balance sheet accounts and
uses its external financing as a balancing, or “plug,” figure. The judgmental
approach represents an improved version of the percent-of-sales approach to pro
forma balance sheet preparation. Because the judgmental approach requires only
slightly more information and should yield better estimates than the somewhat
naive percent-of-sales approach, it is presented here.
To apply the judgmental approach to prepare Vectra Manufacturing’s 2013
pro forma balance sheet, a number of assumptions must be made about levels of
various balance sheet accounts:
1. A minimum cash balance of $6,000 is desired.
2. Marketable securities will remain unchanged from their current level of
$4,000.
3. Accounts receivable on average represent about 45 days of sales (about 1/8 of
a year). Because Vectra’s annual sales are projected to be $135,000, accounts
receivable should average $16,875 (1/8
$135,000).
4. The ending inventory should remain at a level of about $16,000, of which 
25 percent (approximately $4,000) should be raw materials and the
remaining 75 percent (approximately $12,000) should consist of finished
goods.
5. A new machine costing $20,000 will be purchased. Total depreciation for the
year is $8,000. Adding the $20,000 acquisition to the existing net fixed assets
of $51,000 and subtracting the depreciation of $8,000 yields net fixed as-
sets of $63,000.
6. Purchases will represent approximately 30 percent of annual sales, which in
this case is approximately $40,500 (0.30
$135,000). The firm estimates
that it can take 73 days on average to satisfy its accounts payable. Thus
accounts payable should equal one-fifth (73 days
365 days) of the firm’s
purchases, or $8,100 (1/5
$40,500).
7. Taxes payable will equal one-fourth of the current year’s tax liability, which
equals $455 (one-fourth of the tax liability of $1,823 shown in the pro forma
income statement in Table 4.15).
8. Notes payable will remain unchanged from their current level of $8,300.
9. No change in other current liabilities is expected. They remain at the level of
the previous year: $3,400.

10. The firm’s long-term debt and its common stock will remain unchanged at
$18,000 and $30,000, respectively; no issues, retirements, or repurchases of
bonds or stocks are planned.
11. Retained earnings will increase from the beginning level of $23,000 (from the
balance sheet dated December 31, 2012, in Table 4.13) to $29,327. The
increase of $6,327 represents the amount of retained earnings calculated in
the year-end 2013 pro forma income statement in Table 4.15.
A 2013 pro forma balance sheet for Vectra Manufacturing based on these
assumptions is presented in Table 4.16. A “plug” figure—called the external
financing required—of $8,293 is needed to bring the statement into balance. This
means that the firm will have to obtain about $8,300 of additional external
financing to support the increased sales level of $135,000 for 2013.
A positive value for “external financing required,” like that shown in Table
4.16, means that, based on its plans, the firm will not generate enough internal
financing to support its forecast growth in assets. To support the forecast level of
operation, the firm must raise funds externally by using debt and/or equity
financing or by reducing dividends. Once the form of financing is determined, the
pro forma balance sheet is modified to replace “external financing required” with
the planned increases in the debt and/or equity accounts.
A negative value for “external financing required” indicates that, based on its
plans, the firm will generate more financing internally than it needs to support its
forecast growth in assets. In this case, funds are available for use in repaying debt,
repurchasing stock, or increasing dividends. Once the specific actions are deter-
mined, “external financing required” is replaced in the pro forma balance sheet
with the planned reductions in the debt and/or equity accounts. Obviously, besides

4.7 Evaluation of Pro Forma Statements
It is difficult to forecast the many variables involved in preparing pro forma state-
ments. As a result, investors, lenders, and managers frequently use the techniques
presented in this chapter to make rough estimates of pro forma financial state-
ments. Yet, it is important to recognize the basic weaknesses of these simplified
approaches. The weaknesses lie in two assumptions: (1) that the firm’s past finan-
cial condition is an accurate indicator of its future; and (2) that certain variables
(such as cash, accounts receivable, and inventories) can be forced to take on cer-
tain “desired” values. These assumptions cannot be justified solely on the basis of
their ability to simplify the calculations involved. However, despite their weak-
nesses, the simplified approaches to pro forma statement preparation are likely to
remain popular because of their relative simplicity. The widespread use of spread-
sheets certainly helps to streamline the financial planning process.
However pro forma statements are prepared, analysts must understand how
to use them to make financial decisions. Both financial managers and lenders can
use pro forma statements to analyze the firm’s inflows and outflows of cash, as
well as its liquidity, activity, debt, profitability, and market value. Various ratios
can be calculated from the pro forma income statement and balance sheet to eval-
uate performance. Cash inflows and outflows can be evaluated by preparing a
pro forma statement of cash flows. After analyzing the pro forma statements, the
financial manager can take steps to adjust planned operations to achieve short-
term financial goals. For example, if projected profits on the pro forma income
statement are too low, a variety of pricing and/or cost-cutting actions might be
initiated. If the projected level of accounts receivable on the pro forma balance
sheet is too high, changes in credit or collection policy may be called for. Pro
forma statements are therefore of great importance in solidifying the firm’s finan-
cial plans for the coming year.

Summary
FOCUS ON VALUE
Cash flow, the lifeblood of the firm, is a key determinant of the value of the
firm. The financial manager must plan and manage the firm’s cash flow. The
goal is to ensure the firm’s solvency and to generate positive cash flow for the
firm’s owners. Both the magnitude and the risk of the cash flows generated on
behalf of the owners determine the firm’s value.
To carry out the responsibility to create value for owners, the financial man-
ager uses tools such as cash budgets and pro forma financial statements as part
of the process of generating positive cash flow. Good financial plans should
result in large free cash flows. Clearly, the financial manager must deliberately
and carefully plan and manage the firm’s cash flows to achieve the firm’s goal of
maximizing share price.
REVIEW OF LEARNING GOALS
Understand tax depreciation procedures and the effect of depreciation
on the firm’s cash flows. Depreciation is an important factor affecting a firm’s
cash flow. An asset’s depreciable value and depreciable life are determined by
using the MACRS standards in the federal tax code. MACRS groups assets
(excluding real estate) into six property classes based on length of recovery
period.
Discuss the firm’s statement of cash flows, operating cash flow, and free
cash flow. The statement of cash flows is divided into operating, investment,
and financing flows. It reconciles changes in the firm’s cash flows with changes
in cash and marketable securities for the period. Interpreting the statement of
cash flows involves both the major categories of cash flow and the individual
items of cash inflow and outflow. From a strict financial point of view, a firm’s
operating cash flow is defined to exclude interest. Of greater importance is a
firm’s free cash flow, which is the amount of cash flow available to creditors and
owners.
Understand the financial planning process, including long-term (strategic)
financial plans and short-term (operating) financial plans. The two key aspects
of the financial planning process are cash planning and profit planning. Cash
planning involves the cash budget or cash forecast. Profit planning relies on the
pro forma income statement and balance sheet. Long-term (strategic) financial
plans act as a guide for preparing short-term (operating) financial plans. 
Long-term plans tend to cover periods ranging from 2 to 10 years; short-term
plans most often cover a 1- to 2-year period.
Discuss the cash-planning process and the preparation, evaluation, and
use of the cash budget. The cash-planning process uses the cash budget, based
on a sales forecast, to estimate short-term cash surpluses and shortages. The
cash budget is typically prepared for a 1-year period divided into months. It nets
cash receipts and disbursements for each period to calculate net cash flow.
LG 4
LG 3
LG 2
LG 1

Ending cash is estimated by adding beginning cash to the net cash flow. By 
subtracting the desired minimum cash balance from the ending cash, the firm
can determine required total financing or the excess cash balance. To cope with
uncertainty in the cash budget, scenario analysis or simulation can be used. 
A firm must also consider its pattern of daily cash receipts and cash 
disbursements.
Explain the simplified procedures used to prepare and evaluate the pro
forma income statement and the pro forma balance sheet. A pro forma income
statement can be developed by calculating past percentage relationships 
between certain cost and expense items and the firm’s sales and then applying
these percentages to forecasts. Because this approach implies that all costs and
expenses are variable, it tends to understate profits when sales are increasing
and to overstate profits when sales are decreasing. This problem can be 
avoided by breaking down costs and expenses into fixed and variable 
components. In this case, the fixed components remain unchanged from the
most recent year, and the variable costs and expenses are forecast on a 
percent-of-sales basis.
Under the judgmental approach, the values of certain balance sheet accounts
are estimated and the firm’s external financing is used as a balancing, or “plug,”
figure. A positive value for “external financing required” means that the firm
will not generate enough internal financing to support its forecast growth in
assets and will have to raise funds externally or reduce dividends. A negative
value for “external financing required” indicates that the firm will generate
more financing internally than it needs to support its forecast growth in assets
and funds will be available for use in repaying debt, repurchasing stock, or
increasing dividends.
Evaluate the simplified approaches to pro forma financial statement
preparation and the common uses of pro forma statements. Simplified
approaches for preparing pro forma statements assume that the firm’s past
financial condition is an accurate indicator of the future. Pro forma statements
are commonly used to forecast and analyze the firm’s level of profitability and
overall financial performance so that adjustments can be made to planned oper-
ations to achieve short-term financial goals.

Opener-in-Review
The chapter opener mentions that in 2010, Apple’s stock sold for approximately
$200. Apple had just over $40 billion in cash on its balance sheet and just fewer
than 1 billion shares outstanding, so each Apple share represented a claim on
$40 of Apple’s cash. Suppose that when Apple invests in the resources necessary
to create new technology products, it expects to earn a 20% rate of return.
Suppose also that when it invests its cash, Apple earns just 1%. Given this, what
rate of return should investors expect if they pay $200 to acquire one share of
Apple?

Depreciation and cash flow
A firm expects to have earnings before interest and
taxes (EBIT) of $160,000 in each of the next 6 years. It pays annual interest of
$15,000. The firm is considering the purchase of an asset that costs $140,000,
requires $10,000 in installation cost, and has a recovery period of 5 years. It will be
the firm’s only asset, and the asset’s depreciation is already reflected in its EBIT 
estimates.
a. Calculate the annual depreciation for the asset purchase using the MACRS
depreciation percentages in Table 4.2 on page 117.
b. Calculate the firm’s operating cash flows for each of the 6 years, using Equation
4.3. Assume that the firm is subject to a 40% tax rate on all the profit that it
earns.
c. Suppose the firm’s net fixed assets, current assets, accounts payable, and accruals

McDonald notes that historically, 30% of sales have been for cash. Of credit sales,
70% are collected 1 month after the sale, and the remaining 30% are collected 
2 months after the sale. The firm wishes to maintain a minimum ending balance in
its cash account of $25. Balances above this amount would be invested in short-term
government securities (marketable securities), whereas any deficits would be
financed through short-term bank borrowing (notes payable). The beginning cash
balance at April 1 is $115.
a. Prepare cash budgets for April, May, and June.

b. How much financing, if any, at a maximum would Carroll Company require to
meet its obligations during this 3-month period?

Spreadsheet Exercise
You have been assigned the task of putting together a statement for the ACME
Company that shows its expected inflows and outflows of cash over the months of
July 2013 through December 2013.
You have been given the following data for ACME Company:
(1) Expected gross sales for May through December, respectively, are $300,000,
$290,000, $425,000, $500,000, $600,000, $625,000, $650,000, and
$700,000.
(2) 12% of the sales in any given month are collected during that month. However,
the firm has a credit policy of 3/10 net 30, so factor a 3% discount into the
current month’s sales collection.
(3) 75% of the sales in any given month are collected during the following month
after the sale.
(4) 13% of the sales in any given month are collected during the second month fol-
lowing the sale.
(5) The expected purchases of raw materials in any given month are based on 60%
of the expected sales during the following month.
(6) The firm pays 100% of its current month’s raw materials purchases in the fol-
lowing month.
(7) Wages and salaries are paid on a monthly basis and are based on 6% of the
current month’s expected sales.
(8) Monthly lease payments are 2% of the current month’s expected sales.
(9) The monthly advertising expense amounts to 3% of sales.
(10) R&D expenditures are expected to be allocated to August, September, and
October at the rate of 12% of sales in those months.
(11) During December a prepayment of insurance for the following year will be
made in the amount of $24,000.
(12) During the months of July through December, the firm expects to have miscel-
laneous expenditures of $15,000, $20,000, $25,000, $30,000, $35,000, and
$40,000, respectively.
(13) Taxes will be paid in September in the amount of $40,000 and in December in
the amount of $45,000.
(14) The beginning cash balance in July is $15,000.
(15) The target cash balance is $15,000.
TO DO
a. Prepare a cash budget for July 2013 through December 2013 by creating a com-
bined spreadsheet that incorporates spreadsheets similar to those in Tables 4.8,
4.9, and 4.10. Divide your spreadsheet into three sections:
(1) Total cash receipts
(2) Total cash disbursements
(3) Cash budget covering the period of July through December
The cash budget should reflect the following:
(1) Beginning and ending monthly cash balances
(2) The required total financing in each month required
(3) The excess cash balance in each month with excess

b. Based on your analysis, briefly describe the outlook for this company over the
next 6 months. Discuss its specific obligations and the funds available to meet
them. What could the firm do in the case of a cash deficit? (Where could it get
the money?) What should the firm do if it has a cash surplus?

Time Value of Money
Why This Chapter Matters to You
In your professional life
ACCOUNTING You need to understand time-value-of-money calcula-
tions to account for certain transactions such as loan amortization,
lease payments, and bond interest rates.
INFORMATION SYSTEMS You need to understand time-value-of-money
calculations to design systems that accurately measure and value the
firm’s cash flows.
MANAGEMENT You need to understand time-value-of-money calcula-
tions so that you can manage cash receipts and disbursements in a
way that will enable the firm to receive the greatest value from its cash
flows.
MARKETING You need to understand time value of money because
funding for new programs and products must be justified financially
using time-value-of-money techniques.
OPERATIONS You need to understand time value of money because
the value of investments in new equipment, in new processes, and in
inventory will be affected by the time value of money.
Time-value-of-money techniques are
widely used in personal financial
planning. You can use them to calculate the value of savings at given
future dates and to estimate the amount you need now to accumulate a
given amount at a future date. You also can apply them to value lump-
sum amounts or streams of periodic cash flows and to the interest rate
or amount of time needed to achieve a given financial goal.

ompanies spend money on new investments if
they believe that those investments will later gen-
erate enough cash flow to justify the up-front cost. For
pharmaceutical companies like Eli Lilly, the average
length of time from the discovery of a new drug until
delivery to a patient is 10 to 15 years. After R&D pro-
duces a promising lead, a drug is still a long way from
being ready for human testing. Researchers must probe
further to determine what dosage will be required and
at what level it might be toxic to the patient. They also
must explore practical issues such as whether Lilly will be
able to manufacture the compound on a large scale.
The clinical trials themselves can take years.
To help recoup its investment, a drug manufacturer
can get a 20-year patent that grants the company exclu-
sive rights to the new drug. However, with the lengthy
research and approval process, companies may have
fewer than 10 years to sell the drug while the patent is
in force. Once patent protection expires, generic drug
manufacturers enter the market with low-priced alterna-
tives to the name-brand drug.
For Eli Lilly, the cost of bringing a new drug to
market runs from $800 million to $1.2 billion. To keep its drug pipeline full, Eli Lilly plows some
20 percent of sales back into the R&D programs on which its future depends. With large cash
expenditures occurring years before any cash return, the time value of money is an important
factor in calculating the economic viability of a new drug. In this chapter, you will learn how to
determine the present value of future cash flows and other time-value-of-money calculations.

CHAPTER 5
Time Value of Money
161
5.1 The Role of Time Value in Finance
The time value of money refers to the observation that it is better to receive
money sooner than later. Money that you have in hand today can be invested to
earn a positive rate of return, producing more money tomorrow. For that reason,
a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future. In business, managers
constantly face trade-offs in situations where actions that require outflows of
cash today may produce inflows of cash later. Because the cash that comes in the
future is worth less than the cash that firms spend up front, managers need a set
of tools to help them compare cash inflows and outflows that occur at different
times. This chapter introduces you to those tools.
FUTURE VALUE VERSUS PRESENT VALUE
Suppose a firm has an opportunity to spend $15,000 today on some investment
that will produce $17,000 spread out over the next five years as follows:
Year 1
$3,000
Year 2
$5,000
Year 3
$4,000
Year 4
$3,000
Year 5
$2,000
Is this a wise investment? It might seem that the obvious answer is yes because the
firm spends $15,000 and receives $17,000. Remember, though, that the value of
the dollars the firm receives in the future is less than the value of the dollars that
they spend today. Therefore, it is not clear whether the $17,000 inflows are
enough to justify the initial investment.
Time-value-of-money analysis helps managers answer questions like these.
The basic idea is that managers need a way to compare cash today versus cash in
the future. There are two ways of doing this. One way is to ask the question,
What amount of money in the future is equivalent to $15,000 today? In other
words, what is the future value of $15,000? The other approach asks, What
amount today is equivalent to $17,000 paid out over the next 5 years as outlined
above? In other words, what is the present value of the stream of cash flows
coming in the next 5 years?
A time line depicts the cash flows associated with a given investment. It is a
horizontal line on which time zero appears at the leftmost end and future periods
are marked from left to right. A time line illustrating our hypothetical investment
problem appears in Figure 5.1. The cash flows occurring at time zero (today) and

at the end of each subsequent year are above the line; the negative values repre-
sent cash outflows ($15,000 invested today at time zero), and the positive values
represent cash inflows ($3,000 inflow in 1 year, $5,000 inflow in 2 years, and 
so on).
To make the right investment decision, managers need to compare the cash
flows depicted in Figure 5.1 at a single point in time. Typically, that point is either
the end or the beginning of the investment’s life. The future value technique uses
compounding to find the future value of each cash flow at the end of the invest-
ment’s life and then sums these values to find the investment’s future value. This
approach is depicted above the time line in Figure 5.2. The figure shows that the
future value of each cash flow is measured at the end of the investment’s 5-year
life. Alternatively, the present value technique uses discounting to find the present
value of each cash flow at time zero and then sums these values to find the invest-
ment’s value today. Application of this approach is depicted below the time line in
Figure 5.2. In practice, when making investment decisions, managers usually
adopt the present value approach.
COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS
Finding present and future values can involve time-consuming calculations.
Although you should understand the concepts and mathematics underlying these
calculations, financial calculators and spreadsheets streamline the application of
time value techniques.
Financial Calculators
Financial calculators include numerous preprogrammed financial routines.
Learning how to use these routines can make present and future values calcula-
tions a breeze.
We focus primarily on the keys pictured in Figure 5.3. We typically use four of
the first five keys shown in the left column, along with the compute (CPT) key. One
of the four keys represents the unknown value being calculated. The keystrokes on

some of the more sophisticated calculators are menu-driven: After you select the
appropriate routine, the calculator prompts you to input each value. Regardless,
any calculator with the basic future and present value functions can simplify
time-value-of-money calculations. The keystrokes for financial calculators are
explained in the reference guides that accompany them.
Once you understand the basic underlying concepts, you probably will want
to use a calculator to streamline calculations. With a little practice, you can
increase both the speed and the accuracy of your financial computations.
Remember that conceptual understanding of the material is the objective. An
ability to solve problems with the aid of a calculator does not necessarily reflect
such an understanding, so don’t just settle for answers. Work with the material
until you are sure you also understand the concepts.
Electronic Spreadsheets
Like financial calculators, electronic spreadsheets have built-in routines that sim-
plify time value calculations. We provide in the text a number of spreadsheet
solutions that identify the cell entries for calculating time values. The value for
each variable is entered in a cell in the spreadsheet, and the calculation is pro-
grammed using an equation that links the individual cells. Changing any of the
input variables automatically changes the solution as a result of the equation
linking the cells.
BASIC PATTERNS OF CASH FLOW
The cash flow—both inflows and outflows—of a firm can be described by its gen-
eral pattern. It can be defined as a single amount, an annuity, or a mixed stream.
Single amount: A lump-sum amount either currently held or expected at some
future date. Examples include $1,000 today and $650 to be received at the
end of 10 years.
Annuity: A level periodic stream of cash flow. For our purposes, we’ll work
primarily with annual cash flows. Examples include either paying out or
receiving $800 at the end of each of the next 7 years.
Mixed stream: A stream of cash flow that is not an annuity; a stream of
unequal periodic cash flows that reflect no particular pattern. Examples
include the following two cash flow streams A and B.

Note that neither cash flow stream has equal, periodic cash flows and that A
is a 6-year mixed stream and B is a 4-year mixed stream.
In the next three sections of this chapter, we develop the concepts and tech-
niques for finding future and present values of single amounts, annuities, and
mixed streams, respectively. Detailed demonstrations of these cash flow patterns

5.2 Single Amounts
Imagine that at age 25 you began investing $2,000 per year in an investment that
earns 5 percent interest. At the end of 40 years, at age 65, you would have
invested a total of $80,000 (40 years
$2,000 per year). How much would you
have accumulated at the end of the fortieth year? $100,000? $150,000?
$200,000? No, your $80,000 would have grown to $242,000! Why? Because the
time value of money allowed your investments to generate returns that built on
each other over the 40 years.
FUTURE VALUE OF A SINGLE AMOUNT
The most basic future value and present value concepts and computations con-
cern single amounts, either present or future amounts. We begin by considering
problems that involve finding the future value of cash that is on hand immedi-
ately. Then we will use the underlying concepts to solve problems that determine
the value today of cash that will be received or paid in the future.
We often need to find the value at some future date of a given amount of
money placed on deposit today. For example, if you deposit $500 today into an
account that pays 5 percent annual interest, how much would you have in the
account in 10 years? Future value is the value at a given future date of an amount
placed on deposit today and earning interest at a specified rate. The future value
depends on the rate of interest earned and the length of time the money is left on
deposit. Here we explore the future value of a single amount.

The Concept of Future Value
We speak of compound interest to indicate that the amount of interest earned on
a given deposit has become part of the principal at the end of a specified period.
The term principal refers to the amount of money on which the interest is paid.
Annual compounding is the most common type.
The future value of a present amount is found by applying compound interest
over a specified period of time. Savings institutions advertise compound interest
returns at a rate of x percent, or x percent interest, compounded annually, semi-
annually, quarterly, monthly, weekly, daily, or even continuously. The concept of
future value with annual compounding can be illustrated by a simple example.
If Fred Moreno places $100 in a savings account paying 8%
interest compounded annually, at the end of 1 year he will have
$108 in the account—the initial principal of $100 plus 8% ($8) in interest. The
future value at the end of the first year is calculated by using Equation 5.1:
Future value at end of year 
(5.1)
If Fred were to leave this money in the account for another year, he would be
paid interest at the rate of 8% on the new principal of $108. At the end of this
second year there would be $116.64 in the account. This amount would repre-
sent the principal at the beginning of year 2 ($108) plus 8% of the $108 ($8.64)
in interest. The future value at the end of the second year is calculated by using
Equation 5.2:
Future value at end of year 
(5.2)
Substituting the expression between the equals signs in Equation 5.1 for the
$108 figure in Equation 5.2 gives us Equation 5.3:
Future value at end of year 
(5.3)
The equations in the preceding example lead to a more general formula for
calculating future value.
The Equation for Future Value
The basic relationship in Equation 5.3 can be generalized to find the future value
after any number of periods. We use the following notation for the various inputs:
future value at the end of period n

The financial calculator can be used to calculate the future
value directly. First punch in $800 and depress PV; next punch in 5 and depress
N; then punch in 6 and depress I (which is equivalent to “r” in our notation);
finally, to calculate the future value, depress CPT and then FV. The future value
of $1,070.58 should appear on the calculator display as shown at the left. On
many calculators, this value will be preceded by a minus sign (–1,070.58). If a
minus sign appears on your calculator, ignore it here as well as in all other

1. Many calculators allow the user to set the number of payments per year. Most of these calculators are preset for
monthly payments—12 payments per year. Because we work primarily with annual payments—one payment 
per year—it is important to be sure that your calculator is set for one payment per year. And although most calcula-
tors are preset to recognize that all payments occur at the end of the period, it is important to make sure that your
calculator is correctly set on the END mode. To avoid including previous data in current calculations, always clear
all registers of your calculator before inputting values and making each computation. The known values can be
punched into the calculator in any order; the order specified in this as well as other demonstrations of calculator use

“Calculator Use” illustrations in this text.2 (Note: In future examples of calculator
use, we will use only a display similar to that shown on page 166. If you need a
reminder of the procedures involved, go back and review this paragraph.)
Spreadsheet Use
Excel offers a mathematical function that makes the calcula-
tion of future values easy. The format of that function is FV(rate,nper,pmt,pv,
type). The terms inside the parentheses are inputs that Excel requires to calculate
the future value. The terms rate and nper refer to the interest rate and the number
of time periods respectively. The term pv represents the lump sum (or present
value) that you are investing today. For now, we will ignore the other two inputs,
pmt and type, and enter a value of zero. The future value of the single amount
also can be calculated as shown on the following Excel spreadsheet.
2. The calculator differentiates inflows from outflows by preceding the outflows with a negative sign. For example,
in the problem just demonstrated, the $800 present value (PV), because it was keyed as a positive number, is con-
sidered an inflow. Therefore, the calculated future value (FV) of –1,070.58 is preceded by a minus sign to show that
it is the resulting outflow. Had the $800 present value been keyed in as a negative number (–800), the future value
of $1,070.58 would have been displayed as a positive number (1,070.58). Simply stated, the cash flows—present
value (PV) and future value (FV)—will have opposite signs.

Changing any of the values in cells B2, B3, or B4 automatically changes the
result shown in cell B5 because the formula in that cell links back to the others.
As with the calculator, Excel reports cash inflows as positive numbers and cash
outflows as negative numbers. In the example here, we have entered the $800
present value as a negative number, which causes Excel to report the future value
as a positive number. Logically, Excel treats the $800 present value as a cash out-
flow, as if you are paying for the investment you are making, and it treats the
future value as a cash inflow when you reap the benefits of your investment 
5 years later.
A Graphical View of Future Value
Remember that we measure future value at the end of the given period. Figure 5.4
(see page 168) illustrates how the future value depends on the interest rate and
the number of periods that money is invested. The figure shows that (1) the
higher the interest rate, the higher the future value, and (2) the longer the period
of time, the higher the future value. Note that for an interest rate of 0 percent, the
future value always equals the present value ($1.00). But for any interest rate
greater than zero, the future value is greater than the present value of $1.00.

PRESENT VALUE OF A SINGLE AMOUNT
It is often useful to determine the value today of a future amount of money. For
example, how much would I have to deposit today into an account paying 7 per-
cent annual interest to accumulate $3,000 at the end of 5 years? Present value is
the current dollar value of a future amount—the amount of money that would
have to be invested today at a given interest rate over a specified period to equal
the future amount. Like future value, the present value depends largely on the
interest rate and the point in time at which the amount is to be received. This sec-
tion explores the present value of a single amount.
The Concept of Present Value
The process of finding present values is often referred to as discounting cash
flows. It is concerned with answering the following question: If I can earn r per-
cent on my money, what is the most I would be willing to pay now for an oppor-
tunity to receive FVn dollars n periods from today?
This process is actually the inverse of compounding interest. Instead of
finding the future value of present dollars invested at a given rate, discounting
determines the present value of a future amount, assuming an opportunity to
earn a certain return on the money. This annual rate of return is variously
referred to as the discount rate, required return, cost of capital, and opportunity
cost. These terms will be used interchangeably in this text.
Paul Shorter has an opportunity to receive $300 one year from
now. If he can earn 6% on his investments in the normal course
of events, what is the most he should pay now for this opportunity? To answer
this question, Paul must determine how many dollars he would have to invest at
6% today to have $300 one year from now. Letting PV equal this unknown
amount and using the same notation as in the future value discussion, we have

Solving Equation 5.5 for PV gives us Equation 5.6:
(5.6)
The value today (“present value”) of $300 received one year from today,
given an interest rate of 6%, is $283.02. That is, investing $283.02 today at 6%
would result in $300 at the end of one year.
The Equation for Present Value
The present value of a future amount can be found mathematically by solving
Equation 5.4 for PV. In other words, the present value, PV, of some future
amount, FVn, to be received n periods from now, assuming an interest rate (or
opportunity cost) of r, is calculated as follows:
(5.7)
Note the similarity between this general equation for present value and the equa-
tion in the preceding example (Equation 5.6). Let’s use this equation in an example.
Pam Valenti wishes to find the present value of $1,700 that she
will receive 8 years from now. Pam’s opportunity cost is 8%.
Substituting 
and 
into Equation 5.7 yields

A Graphical View of Present Value
Remember that present value calculations assume that the future values are meas-
ured at the end of the given period. The relationships among the factors in a
present value calculation are illustrated in Figure 5.5. The figure clearly shows
that, everything else being equal, (1) the higher the discount rate, the lower the
present value, and (2) the longer the period of time, the lower the present value.
Also note that given a discount rate of 0 percent, the present value always equals
the future value ($1.00). But for any discount rate greater than zero, the present
value is less than the future value of $1.00.

5.3 Annuities
How much would you pay today, given that you can earn 7 percent on low-risk
investments, to receive a guaranteed $3,000 at the end of each of the next 
20 years? How much will you have at the end of 5 years if your employer with-
holds and invests $1,000 of your bonus at the end of each of the next 5 years,
guaranteeing you a 9 percent annual rate of return? To answer these questions,
you need to understand the application of the time value of money to annuities.
An annuity is a stream of equal periodic cash flows, over a specified time
period. These cash flows are usually annual but can occur at other intervals, such
as monthly rent or car payments. The cash flows in an annuity can be inflows
(the $3,000 received at the end of each of the next 20 years) or outflows (the
$1,000 invested at the end of each of the next 5 years).
TYPES OF ANNUITIES
There are two basic types of annuities. For an ordinary annuity, the cash flow
occurs at the end of each period. For an annuity due, the cash flow occurs at the
beginning of each period.
Fran Abrams is evaluating two annuities. Both are 5-year,
$1,000 annuities; annuity A is an ordinary annuity and annuity
B is an annuity due. To better understand the difference between these annuities,
she has listed their cash flows in Table 5.1. Note that the amount of each annuity
totals $5,000. The two annuities differ only in the timing of their cash flows: The
cash flows are received sooner with the annuity due than with the ordinary
annuity.

TABLE 5.1

Although the cash flows of both annuities in Table 5.1 total $5,000, the
annuity due would have a higher future value than the ordinary annuity because
each of its five annual cash flows can earn interest for 1 year more than each of
the ordinary annuity’s cash flows. In general, as will be demonstrated later in this
chapter, the value (present or future) of an annuity due is always greater than the
value of an otherwise identical ordinary annuity.
Because ordinary annuities are more frequently used in finance, unless other-
wise specified, the term annuity is intended throughout this book to refer to ordi-
nary annuities.
FINDING THE FUTURE VALUE OF AN ORDINARY ANNUITY
One way to find the future value of an ordinary annuity is to calculate the future
value of each of the individual cash flows and then add up those figures.
Fortunately, there are several shortcuts to get to the answer. You can calculate the
future value of an ordinary annuity that pays an annual cash flow equal to CF by
using Equation 5.9:
(5.9)
As before, in this equation r represents the interest rate, and n represents the
number of payments in the annuity (or equivalently, the number of years over
which the annuity is spread). The calculations required to find the future value of
an ordinary annuity are illustrated in the following example.
Fran Abrams wishes to determine how much money she will
have at the end of 5 years if she chooses annuity A, the ordinary
annuity. She will deposit $1,000 annually, at the end of each of the next 5 years,
into a savings account paying 7% annual interest. This situation is depicted on the
following time line:

Spreadsheet Use
To calculate the future value of an annuity in Excel, we will use
the same future value function that we used to calculate the future value of a
lump sum, but we will add two new input values. Recall that the future value
function’s syntax is FV(rate,nper,pmt,pv,type). We have already explained the
terms rate, nper, and pv in this function. The term pmt refers to the annual pay-
ment that the annuity offers. The term type is an input that lets Excel know
whether the annuity being valued is an ordinary annuity (in which case the input
value for type is 0 or omitted) or an annuity due (in which case the correct input
value for type is 1). In this particular problem, the input value for pv is 0 or omitted
because there is no up-front money received. The only cash flows are those that
are part of the annuity stream. The future value of the ordinary annuity can be
calculated as shown on the following Excel spreadsheet.

FINDING THE PRESENT VALUE OF AN ORDINARY ANNUITY
Quite often in finance, there is a need to find the present value of a stream of
cash flows to be received in future periods. An annuity is, of course, a stream of
equal periodic cash flows. The method for finding the present value of an ordi-
nary annuity is similar to the method just discussed. One approach would be to
calculate the present value of each cash flow in the annuity and then add up
those present values. Alternatively, the algebraic shortcut for finding the present
value of an ordinary annuity that makes an annual payment of CF for n years
looks like this:

Of course the simplest approach is to solve problems like these with a financial

FINDING THE FUTURE VALUE OF AN ANNUITY DUE
We now turn our attention to annuities due. Remember that the cash flows of an
annuity due occur at the start of the period. In other words, if we are dealing with
annual payments, each payment in an annuity due comes one year earlier than it
would in an ordinary annuity. This in turn means that each payment can earn an
extra year’s worth of interest, which is why the future value of an annuity due
exceeds the future value of an otherwise identical ordinary annuity.
The algebraic shortcut for the future value of an annuity due that makes
annual payments of CF for n years is
(5.12)
Compare this to Equation 5.9 on page 172, which shows how to calculate
the future value of an ordinary annuity. The two equations are nearly identical,
but Equation 5.12 has an added term, 
, at the end. In other words, the
value obtained from Equation 5.12 will be 
times greater than the value in
Equation 5.9 if the other inputs (CF and n) are the same, and that makes sense
because all the payments in the annuity due earn one more year’s worth of
interest compared to the ordinary annuity.
Recall from an earlier example, illustrated in Table 5.1 on page
171, that Fran Abrams wanted to choose between an ordinary
annuity and an annuity due, both offering similar terms except for the timing of
cash flows. We calculated the future value of the ordinary annuity in Example
5.7. We now will calculate the future value of the annuity due.
Calculator Use
Before using your calculator to find the future value of an
annuity due, depending on the specific calculator, you must either switch it to
BEGIN mode or use the DUE key. Then, using the inputs shown at the left, you
will find the future value of the annuity due to be $6,153.29. (Note: Because we
nearly always assume end-of-period cash flows, be sure to switch your calculator
back to END mode when you have completed your annuity-due calculations.)
Spreadsheet Use
The future value of the annuity due also can be calculated 
as shown on the following Excel spreadsheet. Remember that for an annuity 
due the type input value must be set to 1, and we must also specify the pv input
value as 0 since the inputs are in an ordered series.

Comparison of an Annuity Due with an Ordinary Annuity Future Value
The future value of an annuity due is always greater than the future value of an
otherwise identical ordinary annuity. We can see this by comparing the future
values at the end of year 5 of Fran Abrams’s two annuities:
Ordinary annuity
$5,750.74
versus
Annuity due
$6,153.29
Because the cash flow of the annuity due occurs at the beginning of the period
rather than at the end (that is, each payment comes one year sooner in the
annuity due), its future value is greater. How much greater? It is interesting to cal-
culate the percentage difference between the value of the annuity and the value of
the annuity due:
Recall that the interest rate in this example is 7 percent. It is no coincidence
that the annuity due is 7 percent more valuable than the annuity. An extra year’s
interest on each of the annuity due’s payments make the annuity due 7 percent
more valuable than the annuity.
FINDING THE PRESENT VALUE OF AN ANNUITY DUE
We can also find the present value of an annuity due. This calculation can be
easily performed by adjusting the ordinary annuity calculation. Because the cash
flows of an annuity due occur at the beginning rather than the end of the period,
to find their present value, each annuity due cash flow is discounted back one less
year than for an ordinary annuity. The algebraic formula for the present value of
an annuity due looks like this:
(5.13)
Notice the similarity between this equation and Equation 5.11 on page 173.
The two equations are identical except that Equation 5.13 has an extra term at
the end, 
. The reason for this extra term is the same as in the case when we
calculated the future value of the annuity due. In the annuity due, each payment
arrives one year earlier (compared to the annuity), so each payment is worth a
little more—one year’s interest more.

In Example 5.8 of Braden Company, we found the present value of Braden’s
$700, 5-year ordinary annuity discounted at 8% to be $2,794.90. If we now
assume that Braden’s $700 annual cash flow occurs at the start of each year and
is thereby an annuity due, we can calculate its present value using a calculator or
a spreadsheet.
Calculator Use
Before using your calculator to find the present value of an
annuity due, depending on the specifics of your calculator, you must either
switch it to BEGIN mode or use the DUE key. Then, using the inputs shown at

Because we nearly always assume end-of-period cash flows, be sure to switch

FINDING THE PRESENT VALUE OF A PERPETUITY
A perpetuity is an annuity with an infinite life—in other words, an annuity that
never stops providing its holder with a cash flow at the end of each year (for
example, the right to receive $500 at the end of each year forever).
It is sometimes necessary to find the present value of a perpetuity. Fortunately,
the calculation for the present value of a perpetuity is one of the easiest in all of
finance. If a perpetuity pays an annual cash flow of CF, starting one year from
now, the present value of the cash flow stream is
(5.14)
Ross Clark wishes to endow a chair in finance at his alma
mater. The university indicated that it requires $200,000 per
year to support the chair, and the endowment would earn 10% per year. To deter-
mine the amount Ross must give the university to fund the chair, we must deter-
mine the present value of a $200,000 perpetuity discounted at 10%. Using
equation 5.14, we can determine that the present value of a perpetuity paying
$200,000 per year is $2 million when the interest rate is 10%:
In other words, to generate $200,000 every year for an indefinite period requires
$2,000,000 today if Ross Clark’s alma mater can earn 10% on its investments. If
the university earns 10% interest annually on the $2,000,000, it can withdraw
$200,000 per year indefinitely.

5.4 Mixed Streams
Two basic types of cash flow streams are possible, the annuity and the mixed
stream. Whereas an annuity is a pattern of equal periodic cash flows, a mixed
stream is a stream of unequal periodic cash flows that reflect no particular pat-
tern. Financial managers frequently need to evaluate opportunities that are
expected to provide mixed streams of cash flows. Here we consider both the
future value and the present value of mixed streams.

Determining the future value of a mixed stream of cash flows is straightforward.
We determine the future value of each cash flow at the specified future date and
then add all the individual future values to find the total future value.
Shrell Industries, a cabinet manufacturer, expects to receive the following mixed

If Shrell expects to earn 8% on its investments, how much will it accumulate by
the end of year 5 if it immediately invests these cash flows when they are
received? This situation is depicted on the following time line:
Calculator Use
You can use your calculator to find the future value of each
individual cash flow, as demonstrated earlier (on page 167), and then sum the
future values to get the future value of the stream. Unfortunately, unless you can
program your calculator, most calculators lack a function that would allow you
to input all of the cash flows, specify the interest rate, and directly calculate the
future value of the entire cash flow stream. Had you used your calculator to find
the individual cash flow future values and then summed them, the future value of
Shrell Industries’ cash flow stream at the end of year 5 would have been
$83,608.15.
Spreadsheet Use
A relatively simple way to use Excel to calculate the future
value of a mixed stream is to use the Excel future value (FV) function discussed
on page 167 combined with the net present value (NPV) function (which will be
discussed on page 181). The trick is to use the NPV function to first find the
present value of the mixed stream and then find the future of this present value
amount. The following Excel spreadsheet illustrates this approach:

PRESENT VALUE OF A MIXED STREAM
Finding the present value of a mixed stream of cash flows is similar to finding the
future value of a mixed stream. We determine the present value of each future
amount and then add all the individual present values together to find the total
present value.

the following mixed stream of cash flows over the next 5 years:

rate, and then directly calculate the present value of the entire cash flow stream.
The present value of Frey Company’s cash flow stream found using a calculator is

Spreadsheet Use
To calculate the present value of a mixed stream in Excel, we
will make use of a new function. The syntax of that function is NPV(rate,value1,
value2,value3, . . .). The rate argument is the interest rate, and value1,
value2,value3, . . . represent the stream of cash flows. The NPV function
assumes that the first payment in the stream arrives one year in the future, and all
subsequent payments arrive at one-year intervals. The present value of the mixed

5.5 Compounding Interest More Frequently Than
Annually
Interest is often compounded more frequently than once a year. Savings institu-
tions compound interest semiannually, quarterly, monthly, weekly, daily, or even
continuously. This section discusses various issues and techniques related to these
more frequent compounding intervals.
SEMIANNUAL COMPOUNDING
Semiannual compounding of interest involves two compounding periods within
the year. Instead of the stated interest rate being paid once a year, one-half of the
stated interest rate is paid twice a year.
semiannual compounding
Compounding of interest over
two periods within the year.
LG 5

Fred Moreno has decided to invest $100 in a savings account
paying 8% interest compounded semiannually. If he leaves his
money in the account for 24 months (2 years), he will be paid 4% interest com-
pounded over four periods, each of which is 6 months long. Table 5.3 shows that
at the end of 12 months (1 year) with 8% semiannual compounding, Fred will
have $108.16; at the end of 24 months (2 years), he will have $116.99.

QUARTERLY COMPOUNDING
Quarterly compounding of interest involves four compounding periods within
the year. One-fourth of the stated interest rate is paid four times a year.
Fred Moreno has found an institution that will pay him 8%
interest compounded quarterly. If he leaves his money in this
account for 24 months (2 years), he will be paid 2% interest compounded over
eight periods, each of which is 3 months long. Table 5.4 shows the amount Fred
will have at the end of each period. At the end of 12 months (1 year), with 8%
quarterly compounding, Fred will have $108.24; at the end of 24 months (2 years),
he will have $117.17.

Table 5.5 compares values for Fred Moreno’s $100 at the end of years 1 and
2 given annual, semiannual, and quarterly compounding periods at the 8 percent
rate. The table shows that the more frequently interest is compounded, the
greater the amount of money accumulated. This is true for any interest rate for
any period of time.
A GENERAL EQUATION FOR COMPOUNDING MORE
FREQUENTLY THAN ANNUALLY
The future value formula (Equation 5.4) can be rewritten for use when com-
pounding takes place more frequently. If m equals the number of times per year
interest is compounded, the formula for the future value of a lump sum becomes
(5.15)
If 
, Equation 5.15 reduces to Equation 5.4. Thus, if interest com-
pounds annually, Equation 5.15 will provide the same result as Equation 5.4. The
general use of Equation 5.15 can be illustrated with a simple example.
The preceding examples calculated the amount that Fred
Moreno would have at the end of 2 years if he deposited $100
at 8% interest compounded semiannually and compounded quarterly. For semi-
annual compounding, m would equal 2 in Equation 5.15; for quarterly com-
pounding, m would equal 4. Substituting the appropriate values for semiannual
and quarterly compounding into Equation 5.14, we find that
1. For semiannual compounding:
2. For quarterly compounding:
These results agree with the values for 
in Tables 5.5 and 5.6.
If the interest were compounded monthly, weekly, or daily, m would equal 12, 52,
or 365, respectively.

USING COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS FOR COMPOUNDING MORE
FREQUENTLY THAN ANNUALLY
As before, we can simplify the process of doing the calculations by using a calcu-
lator or spreadsheet program.
Fred Moreno wished to find the future value of $100 invested
at 8% interest compounded both semiannually and quarterly
for 2 years.
Calculator Use
If the calculator were used for the semiannual compounding cal-
culation, the number of periods would be 4 and the interest rate would be 4%.
The future value of $116.99 will appear on the calculator display as shown at the
top left.
For the quarterly compounding case, the number of periods would be 8 and
the interest rate would be 2%. The future value of $117.17 will appear on the
calculator display as shown in the second display at the left.

CONTINUOUS COMPOUNDING
In the extreme case, interest can be compounded continuously. Continuous com-
pounding involves compounding over every nanosecond—the smallest time
period imaginable. In this case, m in Equation 5.15 would approach infinity.
Through the use of calculus, we know that as m approaches infinity, Equation
5.15 converges to
(5.16)
where e is the exponential function,3 which has a value of approximately 2.7183.
FVn = (PV) * (er*n)

, built into them. The use of this key is espe-
cially helpful in calculating future value when interest is compounded continuously.

The future value with continuous compounding therefore equals $117.35. As
expected, the continuously compounded value is larger than the future value of
interest compounded semiannually ($116.99) or quarterly ($117.17). In fact, con-
tinuous compounding produces a greater future value than any other com-
pounding frequency.
NOMINAL AND EFFECTIVE ANNUAL RATES OF INTEREST
Both businesses and investors need to make objective comparisons of loan costs
or investment returns over different compounding periods. To put interest rates
on a common basis, so as to allow comparison, we distinguish between nominal
and effective annual rates. The nominal, or stated, annual rate is the contractual
annual rate of interest charged by a lender or promised by a borrower. The
effective, or true, annual rate (EAR) is the annual rate of interest actually paid or
earned. The effective annual rate reflects the effects of compounding frequency,
whereas the nominal annual rate does not.
Using the notation introduced earlier, we can calculate the effective annual
rate, EAR, by substituting values for the nominal annual rate, r, and the com-
pounding frequency, m, into Equation 5.17:
(5.17)
EAR = a1 + r

nominal (stated) annual rate
Contractual annual rate of
interest charged by a lender 
or promised by a borrower.
effective (true) annual rate
(EAR)
The annual rate of interest
actually paid or earned.

We can apply this equation using data from preceding examples.
Fred Moreno wishes to find the effective annual rate associated
with an 8% nominal annual rate 
when interest is
compounded (1) annually 
; (2) semiannually 
; and (3) quarterly
. Substituting these values into Equation 5.17, we get
1. For annual compounding:
2. For semiannual compounding:
3. For quarterly compounding:
These values demonstrate two important points: The first is that nominal and
effective annual rates are equivalent for annual compounding. The second is that
the effective annual rate increases with increasing compounding frequency, up to
a limit that occurs with continuous compounding.4
For an EAR example related to the “payday loan” business, with discussion
of the ethical issues involved, see the Focus on Ethics box.
At the consumer level, “truth-in-lending laws” require disclosure on credit
card and loan agreements of the annual percentage rate (APR). The APR is the
nominal annual rate found by multiplying the periodic rate by the number of
periods in one year. For example, a bank credit card that charges 1.5 percent per
month (the periodic rate) would have an APR of 18 percent (1.5% per month
12 months per year).
“Truth-in-savings laws,” on the other hand, require banks to quote the
annual percentage yield (APY) on their savings products. The APY is the effective
annual rate a savings product pays. For example, a savings account that pays 
0.5 percent per month would have an APY of 6.17 percent 
.

Quoting loan interest rates at their lower nominal annual rate (the APR) and
savings interest rates at the higher effective annual rate (the APY) offers two
advantages: It tends to standardize disclosure to consumers, and it enables finan-

savings rates.

aggravating to opponents of the 
payday-advance industry. A typical fee
is $15 for every $100 borrowed.
Payday advance companies that
belong to the Community Financial
Services Association of America
(CFSA), an organization dedicated to
promoting responsible regulation of the
industry, limit their member companies
to a maximum of four rollovers of the
original amount borrowed. Thus, a bor-
rower who rolled over an initial $100
loan for the maximum of four times
would accumulate a total of $75 in
fees all within a 10-week period. On
an annualized basis, the fees would
amount to a whopping 391 percent.
An annual rate of 391 percent is a
huge cost in relation to interest charged
on home equity loans, personal loans,
and even credit cards. However, advo-
cates of the payday-advance industry
make the following arguments: Most
payday loan recipients do so either
because funds are unavailable through
conventional loans or because the pay-
day loan averts a penalty or bank fee
which is, in itself, onerous. According
to Check Into Cash, the cost for $100
of overdraft protection is $26.90, a
credit card late fee on $100 is $37,
and the late/disconnect fee on a $100
utility bill is $46.16. Bankrate.com
reports that nonsufficient funds (NSF)
fees average $26.90 per occurrence.
A payday advance could be use-
ful, for example, if you have six out-
standing checks at the time you are
notified that the first check has been
returned for insufficient funds and you
have been charged an NSF fee of
$26. A payday advance could poten-
tially avert subsequent charges of $26
per check for each of the remaining
five checks and allow you time to
rearrange your finances. When used
judiciously, a payday advance can be
a viable option to meet a short-term
cash flow problem despite its high cost.
Used unwisely, or by someone who
continuously relies on a payday loan to
try to make ends meet, payday
advances can seriously harm one’s per-
sonal finances.
3 The 391 percent mentioned
above is an annual nominal rate
[15%
(365

2-week rate (15 percent) be com-
pounded to calculate the effective
annual interest rate?

How Fair Is “Check Into Cash”?
In 1993, the first
Check Into Cash 
location opened in Cleveland,
Tennessee. Today there are more than
1,100 Check Into Cash centers among
an estimated 22,000 payday-advance
lenders in the United States. There is no
doubt about the demand for such
organizations, but the debate continues
on the “fairness” of payday-advance
loans.
A payday loan is a small, unse-
cured, short-term loan ranging from
$100 to $1,000 (depending on the
state) offered by a payday lender such
as Check Into Cash. A payday loan
can solve temporary cash-flow prob-
lems without bouncing a check or incur-
ring late-payment penalties. To receive
a payday advance, borrowers simply
write a personal post-dated check for
the amount they wish to borrow, plus
the payday loan fee. Check Into Cash
holds their checks until payday when
the loans are either paid off in person
or the check is presented to the borrow-
ers’ bank for payment.
Although payday-advance borrow-
ers usually pay a flat fee in lieu of inter-
est, it is the size of the fee in relation to
the amount borrowed that is particularly

5.6 Special Applications of Time Value
Future value and present value techniques have a number of important applica-
tions in finance. We’ll study four of them in this section: (1) determining deposits
needed to accumulate a future sum, (2) loan amortization, (3) finding interest or
growth rates, and (4) finding an unknown number of periods.
DETERMINING DEPOSITS NEEDED TO ACCUMULATE 
A FUTURE SUM
Suppose you want to buy a house 5 years from now, and you estimate that an ini-
tial down payment of $30,000 will be required at that time. To accumulate the
$30,000, you will wish to make equal annual end-of-year deposits into an account
paying annual interest of 6 percent. The solution to this problem is closely related
to the process of finding the future value of an annuity. You must determine what
size annuity will result in a single amount equal to $30,000 at the end of year 5.
Earlier in the chapter, Equation 5.9 was provided for the future value of an
ordinary annuity that made a payment, CF, each year. In the current problem, we
know the future value we want to achieve, $30,000, but we want to solve for the
annual cash payment that we’d have to save to achieve that goal. Solving
Equation 5.9 for CF gives the following:
(5.18)
As a practical matter, to solve problems like this one, analysts nearly always
use a calculator or Excel as demonstrated in the following example.
As just stated, you want to determine the equal annual end-
of-year deposits required to accumulate $30,000 at the end of 
5 years, given an interest rate of 6%.
Calculator Use
Using the calculator inputs shown at the left, you will find the
annual deposit amount to be $5,321.89. Thus, if $5,321.89 is deposited at the
end of each year for 5 years at 6% interest, there will be $30,000 in the account
at the end of 5 years.
Spreadsheet Use
In Excel, solving for the annual cash flow that helps you reach
the $30,000 means using the payment function. Its syntax is PMT(rate,nper,pv,
fv,type). All of the inputs in this function have been discussed previously. The fol-
lowing Excel spreadsheet illustrates how to use this function to find the annual
payment required to save $30,000.

CHAPTER 5

LOAN AMORTIZATION
The term loan amortization refers to the determination of equal periodic loan
payments. These payments provide a lender with a specified interest return and
repay the loan principal over a specified period. The loan amortization process
involves finding the future payments, over the term of the loan, whose present
value at the loan interest rate equals the amount of initial principal borrowed.
Lenders use a loan amortization schedule to determine these payment amounts
and the allocation of each payment to interest and principal. In the case of home
mortgages, these tables are used to find the equal monthly payments necessary 
to amortize, or pay off, the mortgage at a specified interest rate over a 15- to 
30-year period.
Amortizing a loan actually involves creating an annuity out of a present
amount. For example, say you borrow $6,000 at 10 percent and agree to make
equal annual end-of-year payments over 4 years. To find the size of the payments,
the lender determines the amount of a 4-year annuity discounted at 10 percent
that has a present value of $6,000. This process is actually the inverse of finding
the present value of an annuity.
Earlier in the chapter, Equation 5.11 demonstrated how to find the present
value of an ordinary annuity given information about the number of time periods,
the interest rate, and the annuity’s periodic payment. We can rearrange that equa-
tion to solve for the payment, our objective in this problem:
(5.19)
As just stated, you want to determine the equal annual end-
of-year payments necessary to amortize fully a $6,000, 10%
loan over 4 years.
Calculator Use
Using the calculator inputs shown at the left, you will find the
annual payment amount to be $1,892.82. Thus, to repay the interest and prin-
cipal on a $6,000, 10%, 4-year loan, equal annual end-of-year payments of
$1,892.82 are necessary.
The allocation of each loan payment to interest and principal can be seen
in columns 3 and 4 of the loan amortization schedule in Table 5.6 on page
190. The portion of each payment that represents interest (column 3) declines
over the repayment period, and the portion going to principal repayment
(column 4) increases. This pattern is typical of amortized loans; as the prin-
cipal is reduced, the interest component declines, leaving a larger portion of
each subsequent loan payment to repay principal.
Spreadsheet Use
The annual payment to repay the loan also can be calculated
as shown on the first Excel spreadsheet shown on page 190. The amortization
schedule, shown in Table 5.6, allocating each loan payment to interest and
principal can be calculated precisely as shown on the second spreadsheet on
page 190.

FINDING INTEREST OR GROWTH RATES
It is often necessary to calculate the compound annual interest or growth rate (that
is, the annual rate of change in values) of a series of cash flows. Examples include
finding the interest rate on a loan, the rate of growth in sales, and the rate of growth
in earnings. In doing this, we again make use of Equation 5.4. In this case, we want
to solve for the interest rate (or growth rate) representing the increase in value of
some investment between two time periods. Solving Equation 5.4 for r we have
(5.20)
The simplest situation is one in which an investment’s value has increased over
time, and you want to know the annual rate of growth (that is, interest) that is
represented by the increase in the investment.
Ray Noble purchased an investment four years ago for $1,250.
Now it is worth $1,520. What compound annual rate of return
has Ray earned on this investment? Plugging the appropriate values into
Equation 5.20, we have
per year
Calculator Use
Using the calculator to find the interest or growth rate, we treat
the earliest value as a present value, PV, and the latest value as a future value, FVn.
(Note: Most calculators require either the PV or the FV value to be input as a neg-
ative number to calculate an unknown interest or growth rate. That approach is
used here.) Using the inputs shown at the left, you will find the interest or growth
rate to be 5.01%.

As the housing market
began to boom at the
end of the twentieth century and into
the early twenty-first, the market share
of subprime mortgages climbed from
near 0 percent in 1997 to about 
20 percent of mortgage originations 
in 2006. Several factors combined to
fuel the rapid growth of lending to 
borrowers with tarnished credit, includ-
ing a low interest rate environment,
loose underwriting standards, and 
innovations in mortgage financing 
such as “affordability programs” to
increase rates of homeownership
among lower-income borrowers.

New Century Brings Trouble for Subprime Mortgages
option for many subprime borrowers.
Instead, borrowers in trouble could try
to convince their lenders to allow a
“short sale,” in which the borrower sells
the home for whatever the market will
bear, and the lender agrees to accept
the proceeds from that sale as settle-
ment for the mortgage debt. For lenders
and borrowers alike, foreclosure is the
last, worst option.
3 As a reaction to problems in the
subprime area, lenders tightened
lending standards. What effect do
you think this had on the housing
market?
Particularly attractive to new home
buyers was the hybrid adjustable rate
mortgage (ARM), which featured a low
introductory interest rate that reset
upward after a preset period of time.
Interest rates began a steady upward
trend beginning in late 2004. In
2006, some $300 billion worth of
adjustable ARMs were reset to higher
rates. In a market with rising home val-
ues, a borrower has the option to refi-
nance the mortgage, using some of the
equity created by the home’s increasing
value to reduce the mortgage payment.

FINDING AN UNKNOWN NUMBER OF PERIODS
Sometimes it is necessary to calculate the number of time periods needed to gen-

sider this calculation for both single amounts and annuities. This simplest case is
when a person wishes to determine the number of periods, n, it will take for an
initial deposit, PV, to grow to a specified future amount, FVn, given a stated
interest rate, r.

Using the calculator, we treat the initial value as the present

Bill Smart can borrow $25,000 at an 11% annual interest rate;
equal, annual, end-of-year payments of $4,800 are required.
He wishes to determine how long it will take to fully repay the loan. In other words,

Summary
FOCUS ON VALUE
Time value of money is an important tool that financial managers and other
market participants use to assess the effects of proposed actions. Because firms
have long lives and some decisions affect their long-term cash flows, the effective
application of time-value-of-money techniques is extremely important. These
techniques enable financial managers to evaluate cash flows occurring at dif-
ferent times so as to combine, compare, and evaluate them and link them to the
firm’s overall goal of share price maximization. It will become clear in Chapters 6
and 7 that the application of time value techniques is a key part of the value
determination process needed to make intelligent value-creating decisions.
REVIEW OF LEARNING GOALS
Discuss the role of time value in finance, the use of computational tools,
and the basic patterns of cash flow. Financial managers and investors use time-
value-of-money techniques when assessing the value of expected cash flow
streams. Alternatives can be assessed by either compounding to find future value
or discounting to find present value. Financial managers rely primarily on
present value techniques. Financial calculators, electronic spreadsheets, and
financial tables can streamline the application of time value techniques. The
cash flow of a firm can be described by its pattern—single amount, annuity, or
mixed stream.
Understand the concepts of future value and present value, their calcula-
tion for single amounts, and the relationship between them. Future value (FV)
relies on compound interest to measure future amounts. The initial principal or
deposit in one period, along with the interest earned on it, becomes the begin-
ning principal of the following period.
The present value (PV) of a future amount is the amount of money today
that is equivalent to the given future amount, considering the return that can be
earned. Present value is the inverse of future value.
Find the future value and the present value of both an ordinary annuity
and an annuity due, and find the present value of a perpetuity. An annuity is a
pattern of equal periodic cash flows. For an ordinary annuity, the cash flows

LG 2
LG 1

CHAPTER 5
Time Value of Money
195
occur at the end of the period. For an annuity due, cash flows occur at the
beginning of the period.
The future or present value of an ordinary annuity can be found by using
algebraic equations, a financial calculator, or a spreadsheet program. The value
of an annuity due is always r% greater than the value of an identical annuity.
The present value of a perpetuity—an infinite-lived annuity—equals the annual
cash payment divided by the discount rate.
Calculate both the future value and the present value of a mixed stream
of cash flows. A mixed stream of cash flows is a stream of unequal periodic cash
flows that reflect no particular pattern. The future value of a mixed stream of
cash flows is the sum of the future values of each individual cash flow. Similarly,
the present value of a mixed stream of cash flows is the sum of the present
values of the individual cash flows.
Understand the effect that compounding interest more frequently than
annually has on future value and on the effective annual rate of interest. Interest
can be compounded at intervals ranging from annually to daily and even contin-
uously. The more often interest is compounded, the larger the future amount
that will be accumulated, and the higher the effective, or true, annual rate
(EAR).
The annual percentage rate (APR)—a nominal annual rate—is quoted on
credit cards and loans. The annual percentage yield (APY)—an effective annual
rate—is quoted on savings products.
Describe the procedures involved in (1) determining deposits needed to
accumulate a future sum, (2) loan amortization, (3) finding interest or growth
rates, and (4) finding an unknown number of periods. (1) The periodic deposit
to accumulate a given future sum can be found by solving the equation for the
future value of an annuity for the annual payment. (2) A loan can be amortized
into equal periodic payments by solving the equation for the present value of an
annuity for the periodic payment. (3) Interest or growth rates can be estimated
by finding the unknown interest rate in the equation for the present value of a
single amount or an annuity. (4) The number of periods can be estimated by
finding the unknown number of periods in the equation for the present value of
a single amount or an annuity.

Opener-in-Review
In the chapter opener you learned that it costs Eli Lilly close to $1 billion to bring a
new drug to market, and by the time all of the R&D and clinical trials are completed,
Lilly may have fewer than 10 years left to sell the drug under patent protection.
Assume that the $1 billion cost of bringing a new drug to market is spread out
evenly over 10 years, and then 10 years remain for Lilly to recover their investment.
How much cash would a new drug have to generate in the last 10 years to justify the
$1 billion spent in the first 10 years? Assume that Lilly uses a required rate of return
of 10%.

Value of a single amount versus a mixed stream
Gina Vitale has just contracted to
sell a small parcel of land that she inherited a few years ago. The buyer is willing to
pay $24,000 at the closing of the transaction or will pay the amounts shown in the
following table at the beginning of each of the next 5 years. Because Gina doesn’t
really need the money today, she plans to let it accumulate in an account that earns
7% annual interest. Given her desire to buy a house at the end of 5 years after
closing on the sale of the lot, she decides to choose the payment alternative—
$24,000 single amount or the mixed stream of payments in the following table—
that provides the higher future value at the end of 5 years. Which alternative will she

At the end of 2012, Uma Corporation was considering undertaking a major long-
term project in an effort to remain competitive in its industry. The production and
sales departments determined the potential annual cash flow savings that could
accrue to the firm if it acts soon. Specifically, they estimate that a mixed stream of
future cash flow savings will occur at the end of the years 2013 through 2018. The
years 2019 through 2023 will see consecutive and equal cash flow savings at the end
of each year. The firm estimates that its discount rate over the first 6 years will be 7%.
The expected discount rate over the years 2019 through 2023 will be 11%.
The project managers will find the project acceptable if it results in present cash
flow savings of at least $860,000. The following cash flow savings data are supplied
to the finance department for analysis.
TO DO
Create spreadsheets similar to Table 5.2, and then answer the following questions:
a. Determine the value (at the beginning of 2013) of the future cash flow savings
expected to be generated by this project.
b. Based solely on the one criterion set by management, should the firm undertake
this specific project? Explain.
c. What is the “interest rate risk,” and how might it influence the recommendation
made in part b? Explain.

Integrative Case 2
Track Software, Inc.
S
even years ago, after 15 years in public accounting, Stanley Booker, CPA,
resigned his position as manager of cost systems for Davis, Cohen, and O’Brien
Public Accountants and started Track Software, Inc. In the 2 years preceding his
departure from Davis, Cohen, and O’Brien, Stanley had spent nights and weekends
developing a sophisticated cost-accounting software program that became Track’s
initial product offering. As the firm grew, Stanley planned to develop and expand the
software product offerings—all of which would be related to streamlining the
accounting processes of medium- to large-sized manufacturers.
Although Track experienced losses during its first 2 years of operation—2006
and 2007—its profit has increased steadily from 2008 to the present (2012). The
firm’s profit history, including dividend payments and contributions to retained
earnings, is summarized in Table 1.
Stanley started the firm with a $100,000 investment—his savings of $50,000 as
equity and a $50,000 long-term loan from the bank. He had hoped to maintain his
initial 100 percent ownership in the corporation, but after experiencing a $50,000
loss during the first year of operation (2006), he sold 60 percent of the stock to a
group of investors to obtain needed funds. Since then, no other stock transactions
have taken place. Although he owns only 40 percent of the firm, Stanley actively
manages all aspects of its activities; the other stockholders are not active in manage-
ment of the firm. The firm’s stock was valued at $4.50 per share in 2011 and at
$5.28 per share in 2012.

Stanley has just prepared the firm’s 2012 income statement, balance sheet, and
statement of retained earnings, shown in Tables 2, 3, and 4, along with the 2011
balance sheet. In addition, he has compiled the 2011 ratio values and industry
average ratio values for 2012, which are applicable to both 2011 and 2012 and are
summarized in Table 5 (on page 218). He is quite pleased to have achieved record
earnings of $48,000 in 2012, but he is concerned about the firm’s cash flows.
Specifically, he is finding it more and more difficult to pay the firm’s bills in a timely
manner and generate cash flows to investors—both creditors and owners. To gain
insight into these cash flow problems, Stanley is planning to determine the firm’s
2012 operating cash flow (OCF) and free cash flow (FCF).
Stanley is further frustrated by the firm’s inability to afford to hire a software
developer to complete development of a cost estimation package that is believed to
have “blockbuster” sales potential. Stanley began development of this package 
2 years ago, but the firm’s growing complexity has forced him to devote more of his
time to administrative duties, thereby halting the development of this product.
Stanley’s reluctance to fill this position stems from his concern that the added
$80,000 per year in salary and benefits for the position would certainly lower the
firm’s earnings per share (EPS) over the next couple of years. Although the project’s
success is in no way guaranteed, Stanley believes that if the money were spent to hire
the software developer, the firm’s sales and earnings would significantly rise once the
2- to 3-year development, production, and marketing process was completed.
With all of these concerns in mind, Stanley set out to review the various data to
develop strategies that would help to ensure a bright future for Track Software.
Stanley believed that as part of this process, a thorough ratio analysis of the firm’s
2012 results would provide important additional insights.

TO DO
a. (1) On what financial goal does Stanley seem to be focusing? Is it the correct
goal? Why or why not?
(2) Could a potential agency problem exist in this firm? Explain.
b. Calculate the firm’s earnings per share (EPS) for each year, recognizing that the
number of shares of common stock outstanding has remained unchanged since
the firm’s inception. Comment on the EPS performance in view of your response
in part a.
c. Use the financial data presented to determine Track’s operating cash flow (OCF)
and free cash flow (FCF) in 2012. Evaluate your findings in light of Track’s cur-
rent cash flow difficulties.
d. Analyze the firm’s financial condition in 2012 as it relates to (1) liquidity, 
(2) activity, (3) debt, (4) profitability, and (5) market, using the financial state-
ments provided in Tables 2 and 3 and the ratio data included in Table 5. Be sure to
evaluate the firm on both a cross-sectional and a time-series basis.
e. What recommendation would you make to Stanley regarding hiring a new soft-
ware developer? Relate your recommendation here to your responses in part a.
f.
Track Software paid $5,000 in dividends in 2012. Suppose an investor
approached Stanley about buying 100% of his firm. If this investor believed that
by owning the company he could extract $5,000 per year in cash from the com-
pany in perpetuity, what do you think the investor would be willing to pay for
the firm if the required return on this investment is 10%?
g. Suppose that you believed that the FCF generated by Track Software in 2012
could continue forever. You are willing to buy the company in order to receive
this perpetual stream of free cash flow. What are you willing to pay if you
require a 10% return on your investment?

n Part 2, you learned how to use time-value-of-money tools to compare cash flows at
different times. In the next two chapters you’ll put those tools to practice valuing the
two most common types of securities—bonds and stocks.
Chapter 6 introduces you to the world of interest rates and bonds. Though bonds are
considered to be among the safest investments available, they are not without risk. The
primary risk that bond investors face is the risk that market interest rates will fluctuate.
Those fluctuations cause bond prices to move, and those movements affect the returns
that bond investors earn. Chapter 6 explains why interest rates vary from one bond to
another and the factors that cause interest rates to move.
Chapter 7 focuses on stock valuation. Chapter 7 explains the characteristics of stock
that distinguish it from debt and the chapter describes how companies issue stock to
investors. You’ll have another chance to practice time-value-of-money techniques as the
chapter illustrates how to value stocks by discounting either (1) the dividends that
stockholders receive or (2) the free cash flows that the firm generates over time.

Why This Chapter Matters to You
In your professional life
ACCOUNTING You need to understand interest rates and the various
types of bonds to be able to account properly for amortization of bond
premiums and discounts and for bond issues and retirements.
INFORMATION SYSTEMS You need to understand the data that is
necessary to track bond valuations and bond amortization schedules.
MANAGEMENT You need to understand the behavior of interest rates
and how they affect the types of funds the firm can raise and the timing
and cost of bond issues and retirements.
MARKETING You need to understand how the interest rate level and
the firm’s ability to issue bonds may affect the availability of financing
for marketing research projects and new-product development.
OPERATIONS You need to understand how the interest rate level may
affect the firm’s ability to raise funds to maintain and grow the firm’s
production capacity.
Interest rates have a direct impact
on personal financial planning.
Movements in interest rates occur frequently and affect the returns from
and values of savings and investments. The rate of interest you are
charged on credit cards and loans can have a profound effect on your
personal finances. Understanding the basics of interest rates is impor-
tant to your personal financial success.

A Huge Appetite for Money
W
ho is the largest debtor in the world? The 
U.S. federal government, of course. As of
October 6, 2010, the national debt was more than
$13 trillion, more than $1 trillion of which accrued in
2009 alone. About half of the outstanding U.S. gov-
ernment debt is held by the U.S. Federal Reserve and
other U.S. intragovernmental bodies, and another
quarter is held by foreign investors. Interest on the
national debt is one of the largest items in the federal
budget, totaling $383 billion in 2009. With
Congressional Budget Office estimates projecting
that from 2010 to 2019 the cumulative deficits will exceed $7 trillion, the federal government
has a huge need for outside financing, which dwarfs the capital needs of any corporation.
To feed this huge demand, the U.S. Treasury Department can issue T-bills, debt securities
that mature in less than 1 year, Treasury notes that mature in 1 to 10 years, Treasury bonds that
mature in more than 10 years, and savings bonds. Treasury securities can be purchased at
banks (EE- and I-series savings bonds), at public auctions, and through TreasuryDirect, a Web-
based system that allows investors to establish accounts to conduct transactions in Treasury secu-
rities online. Despite the government’s massive past and projected future deficits, U.S. Treasury
securities are still regarded as the safest investments in the world. In this chapter, you’ll learn
about the pricing of these and other debt instruments.

PART 3
Valuation of Securities
6.1 Interest Rates and Required Returns
As noted in Chapter 2, financial institutions and markets create the mechanism
through which funds flow between savers (funds suppliers) and borrowers (funds
demanders). All else being equal, savers would like to earn as much interest as
possible, and borrowers would like to pay as little as possible. The interest rate
prevailing in the market at any given time reflects the equilibrium between savers
and borrowers.
INTEREST RATE FUNDAMENTALS
The interest rate or required return represents the cost of money. It is the com-
pensation that a supplier of funds expects and a demander of funds must pay.
Usually the term interest rate is applied to debt instruments such as bank loans or
bonds, and the term required return is applied to equity investments, such as
common stock, that give the investor an ownership stake in the issuer. In fact, the
meaning of these two terms is quite similar because, in both cases, the supplier is
compensated for providing funds to the demander.
A variety of factors can influence the equilibrium interest rate. One factor is
inflation, a rising trend in the prices of most goods and services. Typically, savers
demand higher returns (that is, higher interest rates) when inflation is high
because they want their investments to more than keep pace with rising prices. A
second factor influencing interest rates is risk. When people perceive that a par-
ticular investment is riskier, they will expect a higher return on that investment as
compensation for bearing the risk. A third factor that can affect the interest rate
is a liquidity preference among investors. The term liquidity preference refers to
the general tendency of investors to prefer short-term securities (that is, securities
that are more liquid). If, all other things being equal, investors would prefer to
buy short-term rather than long-term securities, interest rates on short-term
instruments such as Treasury bills will be lower than rates on longer-term securi-
ties. Investors will hold these securities, despite the relatively low return that they
offer, because they meet investors’ preferences for liquidity.

The Real Rate of Interest
Imagine a perfect world in which there is no inflation, in which investors have no
liquidity preferences, and in which there is no risk. In this world, there would be one
cost of money—the real rate of interest. The real rate of interest creates equilibrium

Matter of fact
N
ear the height of the financial crisis in December 2008, interest rates on Treasury bills briefly
turned negative, meaning that investors paid more to the Treasury than the Treasury prom-
ised to pay back. Why would anyone put their money into an investment that they know will lose
money? Remember that 2008 saw the demise of Lehman Brothers, and fears that other commer-
cial banks and investments banks might fail were rampant. Evidently, some investors were willing
to pay the U.S. Treasury to keep their money safe for a short time.

between the supply of savings and the demand for funds. It represents the most
basic cost of money. Historically, the real rate of interest in the United States has
averaged about 1 percent per year, but that figure does fluctuate over time. This
supply–demand relationship is shown in Figure 6.1 by the supply function
(labeled S0) and the demand function (labeled D). An equilibrium between the
supply of funds and the demand for funds 
occurs at a rate of interest
r0*, the real rate of interest.
Clearly, the real rate of interest changes with changing economic conditions,
tastes, and preferences. To combat a recession, the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System might initiate actions to increase the supply of credit in
the economy, causing the supply function in Figure 6.1 to shift to, say, S1. This
could result in a lower real rate of interest, r1*, at equilibrium 
. With a
lower cost of money, firms might find that investments that were previously unat-
tractive are now worth undertaking, and as firms hire more workers and spend
more on plant and equipment, the economy begins to expand again.
Nominal or Actual Rate of Interest (Return)
The nominal rate of interest is the actual rate of interest charged by the supplier
of funds and paid by the demander. Throughout this book, interest rates and
required rates of return are nominal rates unless otherwise noted. The nominal
rate of interest differs from the real rate of interest, r*, as a result of two factors,
inflation and risk. When people save money and invest it, they are sacrificing
consumption today (that is, they are spending less than they could) in return for
higher future consumption. When investors expect inflation to occur, they
believe that the price of consuming goods and services will be higher in the
future than in the present. Therefore, they will be reluctant to sacrifice today’s
consumption unless the return they can earn on the money they save (or invest)
will be high enough to allow them to purchase the goods and services they desire
at a higher future price. That is, investors will demand a higher nominal rate of
return if they expect inflation. This higher rate of return is called the expected
inflation premium (IP).

Similarly, investors generally demand higher rates of return on risky investments
as compared to safe ones. Otherwise, there is little incentive for investors to bear the
additional risk. Therefore, investors will demand a higher nominal rate of return on
risky investments. This additional rate of return is called the risk premium (RP).
Therefore, the nominal rate of interest for security 1, r1, is given in Equation 6.1:
(6.1)
As the horizontal braces below the equation indicate, the nominal rate, r1, can be
viewed as having two basic components: a risk-free rate of return, RF, and a risk
premium, RP1:
(6.2)
For the moment, ignore the risk premium, RP1, and focus exclusively on the
risk-free rate. Equation 6.1 says that the risk-free rate can be represented as
(6.3)
The risk-free rate (as shown in Equation 6.3) embodies the real rate of interest
plus the expected inflation premium. The inflation premium is driven by investors’
expectations about inflation—the more inflation they expect, the higher will be
the inflation premium and the higher will be the nominal interest rate.
Three-month U.S. Treasury bills (T-bills) are short-term IOUs issued by the
U.S. Treasury, and they are widely regarded as the safest investments in the
world. They are as close as we can get in the real world to a risk-free investment.
To estimate the real rate of interest, analysts typically try to determine what rate
of inflation investors expect over the coming 3 months. Next, they subtract the
expected inflation rate from the nominal rate on the 3-month T-bill to arrive at
the underlying real rate of interest. For the risk-free asset in Equation 6.3, the real
rate of interest, r*, would equal 
. A simple personal finance example can
demonstrate the practical distinction between nominal and real rates of interest.
Marilyn Carbo has $10 that she can spend on candy costing
$0.25 per piece. She could buy 40 pieces of candy ($10.00
$0.25) today. The nominal rate of interest on a 1-year deposit is currently 7%, and
the expected rate of inflation over the coming year is 4%. Instead of buying the 
40 pieces of candy today, Marilyn could invest the $10. After one year she would
have $10.70 because she would have earned 7% interest—an additional $0.70
—on her $10 deposit. During that year, inflation would have
increased the cost of the candy by 4%—an additional $0.01 
—to
$0.26 per piece. As a result, at the end of the 1-year period Marilyn would be able
to buy about 41.2 pieces of candy ($10.70
$0.26), or roughly 3% more
. The 3% increase in Marilyn’s buying power represents her
real rate of return. The nominal rate of return on her investment (7%), is partly
eroded by inflation (4%), so her real return during the year is the difference
between the nominal rate and the inflation rate 
.

PART 3
Valuation of Securities

The premium for expected inflation in Equation 6.3 represents the average
rate of inflation expected over the life of an investment. It is not the rate of infla-
tion experienced over the immediate past, although investors’ inflation expecta-
tions are undoubtedly influenced by the rate of inflation that has occurred in the
recent past. Even so, the inflation premium reflects the expected rate of inflation.
The expected inflation premium changes over time in response to many factors,
such as changes in monetary and fiscal policies, currency movements, and inter-
national political events. For a discussion of a U.S. debt security whose interest
rate is adjusted for inflation, see the Focus on Practice box.
Figure 6.2 (see page 226) illustrates the annual movement of the rate of infla-
tion and the risk-free rate of return from 1961 through 2009. During this period
the two rates tended to move in a similar fashion. Note that T-bill rates were
slightly above the inflation rate most of the time, meaning that T-bills generally
offered a small positive real return. Between 1978 and the early 1980s, inflation
and interest rates were quite high, peaking at over 13 percent in 1980–1981.
Since then, rates have gradually declined. To combat a severe recession, the
Federal Reserve pushed interest rates down to almost 0% in 2009, and for the
first time in decades, the rate of inflation turned slightly negative (that is, there
was slight deflation that year).

deflation
A general trend of falling
prices.
focus on PRACTICE
I-Bonds Adjust for Inflation
refers to a general trend of falling
prices, so when deflation occurs, the
change in the CPI-U is negative, and
the adjustable portion of an I-bond’s
interest also turns negative. For exam-
ple, if the fixed-rate component on an 
I-bond is 2 percent and prices fall 0.5
percent (stated equivalently, the inflation
rate is –0.5 percent), then the nominal
rate on an I-bond will be just 1.5 per-
cent (2 percent minus 0.5 percent).
Nevertheless, in the past 80 years, peri-
ods of deflation have been very rare,
whereas inflation has been an almost
ever-present feature of the economy, so
investors are likely to enjoy the inflation
protection that I-bonds offer in the future.
3 What effect do you think the 
inflation-adjusted interest rate has
on the price of an I-bond in compari-
son with similar bonds with no
allowance for inflation?
in this index indicates that inflation has
occurred. As the rate of inflation moves
up and down, I-bond interest rates
adjust (with a short lag). Interest earn-
ings are exempt from state and local
income taxes, and are payable only
when an investor redeems an I-bond. 
I-bonds are issued at face value in
denominations of $50, $75, $100,
$200, $500, $1,000, $5,000, and
$10,000.
The I-bond is not without its draw-
backs. Any redemption within the first 
5 years results in a 3-month interest
penalty. Also, you should redeem an 
I-bond only at the first of the month
because none of the interest earned dur-
ing a month is included in the redemp-
tion value until the first day of the
following month. The adjustable-rate
feature of I-bonds can work against
investors (that is, it can lower their
returns) if deflation occurs. Deflation
One of the disadvan-
tages of bonds is that
they usually offer a fixed interest rate.
Once a bond is issued, its interest rate
typically cannot adjust as expected infla-
tion changes. This presents a serious risk
to bond investors because if inflation
rises while the nominal rate on the bond
remains fixed, the real rate of return falls.
The U.S. Treasury Department now
offers the I-bond, which is an inflation-
adjusted savings bond. A Series-I bond
earns interest through the application of
a composite rate. The composite rate
consists of a fixed rate that remains the
same for the life of the bond and an
adjustable rate equal to the actual rate
of inflation. The adjustable rate
changes twice per year and is based
on movements in the Consumer Price
Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U).
This index tracks the prices of thousands
of goods and services, so an increase

TERM STRUCTURE OF INTEREST RATES
The term structure of interest rates is the relationship between the maturity and
rate of return for bonds with similar levels of risk. A graph of this relationship is
called the yield curve. A quick glance at the yield curve tells analysts how rates
vary between short-, medium-, and long-term bonds, but it may also provide
information on where interest rates and the economy in general are headed in the
future. Usually, when analysts examine the term structure of interest rates, they
focus on Treasury securities because these are generally considered to be free of
default risk.
Yield Curves
A bond’s yield to maturity (YTM) (discussed later in this chapter) represents the
compound annual rate of return that an investor earns on the bond assuming that
the bond makes all promised payments and the investor holds the bond to matu-
rity. In a yield curve, the yield to maturity is plotted on the vertical axis and time
to maturity is plotted on the horizontal axis. Figure 6.3 shows three yield curves
for U.S. Treasury securities: one at May 22, 1981, a second at September 29,
1989, and a third at May 28, 2010.
Observe that both the position and the shape of the yield curves change over
time. The yield curve of May 22, 1981, indicates that short-term interest rates at
that time were above longer-term rates. For reasons that a glance at the figure
makes obvious, this curve is described as downward-sloping. Interest rates in
May 1981 were also quite high by historical standards, so the overall level of the
yield curve is high. Historically, a downward-sloping yield curve, which is often
called an inverted yield curve, occurs infrequently and is often a sign that the
economy is weakening. Most recessions in the United States have been preceded
by an inverted yield curve.
Usually, short-term interest rates are lower than long-term interest rates, as
they were on May 28, 2010. That is, the normal yield curve is upward-sloping.
Notice that the May 2010 yield curve lies entirely beneath the other two curves

shown in Figure 6.3. In other words, interest rates in May 2010 were unusually
low, largely because at that time the economy was just beginning to recover from
a deep recession and inflation was very low. Sometimes, a flat yield curve, similar
to that of September 29, 1989, exists. A flat yield curve simply means that rates
do not vary much at different maturities.
The shape of the yield curve may affect the firm’s financing decisions. A
financial manager who faces a downward-sloping yield curve may be tempted to
rely more heavily on cheaper, long-term financing. However, a risk in following
this strategy is that interest rates may fall in the future, so long-term rates that
seem cheap today may be relatively expensive tomorrow. Likewise, when the
yield curve is upward-sloping, the manager may feel that it is wise to use cheaper,
short-term financing. Relying on short-term financing has its own risks. Firms
that borrow on a short-term basis may see their costs rise if interest rates go up.
Even more serious is the risk that a firm may not be able to refinance a short-term
loan when it comes due. A variety of factors influence the choice of loan maturity,
but the shape of the yield curve is something that managers must consider when
making decisions about borrowing short-term versus long-term.
Theories of Term Structure
Three theories are frequently cited to explain the general shape of the yield curve:
the expectations theory, the liquidity preference theory, and the market segmen-
tation theory.
Expectations Theory
One theory of the term structure of interest rates, the
expectations theory, suggests that the yield curve reflects investor expectations
about future interest rates. According to this theory, when investors expect short-
term interest rates to rise in the future (perhaps because investors believe that
inflation will rise in the future), today’s long-term rates will be higher than cur-
rent short-term rates, and the yield curve will be upward sloping. The opposite is

expectations theory
The theory that the yield curve
reflects investor expectations
about future interest rates; an
expectation of rising interest
rates results in an upward-
sloping yield curve, and an
expectation of declining rates
results in a downward-sloping
yield curve.

true when investors expect declining short-term rates—today’s short-term rates
will be higher than current long-term rates, and the yield curve will be inverted.
To understand the expectations theory, consider this example. Suppose that the
yield curve is flat. The rate on a 1-year Treasury note is 4 percent, and so is the rate
on a 2-year Treasury note. Now, consider an investor who has money to place into
a low-risk investment for 2 years. The investor has two options. First, he could pur-
chase the 2-year Treasury note and receive a total of 8 percent (ignoring com-
pounding) in 2 years. Second, he could invest in the 1-year Treasury earning 
4 percent, and then when that security matures, he could reinvest in another 1-year
Treasury note. If the investor wants to maximize his expected return, the decision
between the first and second options above depends on whether he expects interest
rates to rise, fall, or remain unchanged during the next year.
If the investor believes that interest rates will rise, that means next year’s
return on a 1-year Treasury note will be greater than 4 percent (that is, greater
than the 1-year Treasury rate right now). Let’s say the investor believes that the
interest rate on a 1-year note next year will be 5 percent. If the investor expects
rising rates, then his expected return is higher if he follows the second option,
buying a 1-year Treasury note now (paying 4 percent) and reinvesting in a new
security that pays 5 percent next year. Over 2 years, the investor would expect to
earn about 9 percent (ignoring compounding) in interest, compared to just 8 per-
cent earned by holding the 2-year bond.
If the current 1-year rate is 4 percent and investors generally expect that rate
to go up to 5 percent next year, what would the 2-year Treasury note rate have to
be right now to remain competitive? The answer is 4.5 percent. An investor who
buys this security and holds it for 2 years would earn about 9 percent interest
(again, ignoring compounding), the same as the expected return from investing in
two consecutive 1-year bonds. In other words, if investors expect interest rates to
rise, the 2-year rate today must be higher than the 1-year rate today, and that in
turn means that the yield curve must have an upward slope.
Suppose that a 5-year Treasury note currently offers a 3% annual return.
Investors believe that interest rates are going to decline, and 5 years from now,
they expect the rate on a 5-year Treasury note to be 2.5%. According to the
expectations theory, what is the return that a 10-year Treasury note has to offer
today? What does this imply about the slope of the yield curve?
Consider an investor who purchases a 5-year note today and plans to reinvest
in another 5-year note in the future. Over the 10-year investment horizon, this
investor expects to earn about 27.5%, ignoring compounding (that’s 3% per year
for the first 5 years and 2.5% per year for the next 5 years). To compete with that
return, a 10-year bond today could offer 2.75% per year. That is, a bond that
pays 2.75% for each of the next 10 years produces the same 27.5% total return
that the series of two 5-year notes is expected to produce. Therefore, the 5-year
rate today is 3% and the 10-year rate today is 2.75%, and the yield curve is
downward sloping.
Liquidity Preference Theory
Most of the time, yield curves are upward
sloping. According to the expectations theory, this means that investors expect
interest rates to rise. An alternative explanation for the typical upward slope of
the yield curve is the liquidity preference theory. This theory holds that, all else
Example 6.2 3

PART 3
Valuation of Securities
liquidity preference theory
Theory suggesting that long-
term rates are generally higher
than short-term rates (hence,
the yield curve is upward
sloping) because investors
perceive short-term investments
to be more liquid and less risky
than long-term investments.
Borrowers must offer higher
rates on long-term bonds to
entice investors away from
their preferred short-term
securities.

being equal, investors generally prefer to buy short-term securities, while issuers
prefer to sell long-term securities. For investors, short-term securities are attrac-
tive because they are highly liquid and their prices are not particularly volatile.1
Hence, investors will accept somewhat lower rates on short-term bonds because
they are less risky than long-term bonds. Conversely, when firms or governments
want to lock in their borrowing costs for a long period of time by selling long-
term bonds, those bonds have to offer higher rates to entice investors away from
the short-term securities that they prefer. Borrowers are willing to pay somewhat
higher rates because long-term debt allows them to eliminate or reduce the risk of
not being able to refinance short-term debts when they come due. Borrowing on
a long-term basis also reduces uncertainty about future borrowing costs.
Market Segmentation Theory
The market segmentation theory suggests
that the market for loans is totally segmented on the basis of maturity and that
the supply of and demand for loans within each segment determine its prevailing
interest rate. In other words, the equilibrium between suppliers and demanders of
short-term funds, such as seasonal business loans, would determine prevailing
short-term interest rates, and the equilibrium between suppliers and demanders
of long-term funds, such as real estate loans, would determine prevailing long-
term interest rates. The slope of the yield curve would be determined by the gen-
eral relationship between the prevailing rates in each market segment. Simply
stated, an upward-sloping yield curve indicates greater borrowing demand rela-
tive to the supply of funds in the long-term segment of the debt market relative to
the short-term segment.
All three term structure theories have merit. From them we can conclude that
at any time the slope of the yield curve is affected by (1) interest rate expecta-
tions, (2) liquidity preferences, and (3) the comparative equilibrium of supply and
demand in the short- and long-term market segments. Upward-sloping yield
curves result from expectations of rising interest rates, lender preferences for
shorter-maturity loans, and greater supply of short-term loans than of long-term
loans relative to demand. The opposite conditions would result in a downward-
sloping yield curve. At any time, the interaction of these three forces determines
the prevailing slope of the yield curve.
RISK PREMIUMS: ISSUER AND ISSUE CHARACTERISTICS
So far we have considered only risk-free U.S. Treasury securities. We now rein-
troduce the risk premium and assess it in view of risky non-Treasury issues.
Recall Equation 6.1:
In words, the nominal rate of interest for security 1 (r1) is equal to the risk-free
rate, consisting of the real rate of interest (r*) plus the inflation expectation

1. Later in this chapter we demonstrate that debt instruments with longer maturities are more sensitive to changing
market interest rates. For a given change in market rates, the price or value of longer-term debts will be more signif-
icantly changed (up or down) than the price or value of debts with shorter maturities.

issuer and issue characteristics.
The nominal interest rates on a number of classes of long-term securities in May

Because the U.S. Treasury bond would represent the risk-free, long-term security,
we can calculate the risk premium of the other securities by subtracting the risk-
free rate, 3.30%, from each nominal rate (yield):
These risk premiums reflect differing issuer and issue risks. The lower-rated (spec-
ulative) corporate issues have a far higher risk premium than that of the higher-
rated corporate issues (high quality and medium quality), and that risk premium is
the compensation that investors demand for bearing the higher default risk of
lower quality bonds.
The risk premium consists of a number of issuer- and issue-related components,
including business risk, financial risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and tax risk, as
well as the purely debt-specific risks—default risk, maturity risk, and contractual
provision risk, briefly defined in Table 6.1. In general, the highest risk premiums and
therefore the highest returns result from securities issued by firms with a high risk of
default and from long-term maturities that have unfavorable contractual provisions.

CHAPTER 6
Interest Rates and Bond Valuation
231
Debt-Specific Issuer- and Issue-Related Risk Premium Components
Component
Description
Default risk
The possibility that the issuer of debt will not pay the
contractual interest or principal as scheduled. The greater the
uncertainty as to the borrower’s ability to meet these
payments, the greater the risk premium. High bond ratings
reflect low default risk, and low bond ratings reflect high
default risk.
Maturity risk
The fact that the longer the maturity, the more the value of a
security will change in response to a given change in interest
rates. If interest rates on otherwise similar-risk securities
suddenly rise as a result of a change in the money supply, the
prices of long-term bonds will decline by more than the prices
of short-term bonds, and vice versa.a
Contractual provision risk
Conditions that are often included in a debt agreement or a
stock issue. Some of these reduce risk, whereas others may
increase risk. For example, a provision allowing a bond issuer
to retire its bonds prior to their maturity under favorable
terms increases the bond’s risk.
aA detailed discussion of the effects of interest rates on the price or value of bonds and other fixed-income
securities is presented later in this chapter.
TABLE 6.1
6.2 Corporate Bonds
A corporate bond is a long-term debt instrument indicating that a corporation
has borrowed a certain amount of money and promises to repay it in the future
under clearly defined terms. Most bonds are issued with maturities of 10 to 30
years and with a par value, or face value, of $1,000. The coupon interest rate on
a bond represents the percentage of the bond’s par value that will be paid annu-
ally, typically in two equal semiannual payments, as interest. The bondholders,
who are the lenders, are promised the semiannual interest payments and, at
maturity, repayment of the principal amount.

LEGAL ASPECTS OF CORPORATE BONDS
Certain legal arrangements are required to protect purchasers of bonds.
Bondholders are protected primarily through the indenture and the trustee.
Bond Indenture
A bond indenture is a legal document that specifies both the rights of the bond-
holders and the duties of the issuing corporation. Included in the indenture are
descriptions of the amount and timing of all interest and principal payments, various
standard and restrictive provisions, and, frequently, sinking-fund requirements and
security interest provisions. The borrower commonly must (1) maintain satisfactory
accounting records in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
(GAAP); (2) periodically supply audited financial statements; (3) pay taxes and
other liabilities when due; and (4) maintain all facilities in good working order.
Standard Provisions
The standard debt provisions in the bond indenture
specify certain record-keeping and general business practices that the bond issuer
must follow.
Restrictive Provisions
Bond indentures also normally include certain
restrictive covenants, which place operating and financial constraints on the bor-
rower. These provisions help protect the bondholder against increases in bor-
rower risk. Without them, the borrower could increase the firm’s risk but not
have to pay increased interest to compensate for the increased risk.
The most common restrictive covenants do the following:
1. Require a minimum level of liquidity, to ensure against loan default.
2. Prohibit the sale of accounts receivable to generate cash. Selling receivables
could cause a long-run cash shortage if proceeds were used to meet current
obligations.
3. Impose fixed-asset restrictions. The borrower must maintain a specified level
of fixed assets to guarantee its ability to repay the bonds.
4. Constrain subsequent borrowing. Additional long-term debt may be prohib-
ited, or additional borrowing may be subordinated to the original loan.
Subordination means that subsequent creditors agree to wait until all claims
of the senior debt are satisfied.
5. Limit the firm’s annual cash dividend payments to a specified percentage or 
amount.
Other restrictive covenants are sometimes included in bond indentures.
The violation of any standard or restrictive provision by the borrower gives
the bondholders the right to demand immediate repayment of the debt.
Generally, bondholders evaluate any violation to determine whether it jeopar-
dizes the loan. They may then decide to demand immediate repayment, continue
the loan, or alter the terms of the bond indenture.
Sinking-Fund Requirements
Another common restrictive provision is a
sinking-fund requirement. Its objective is to provide for the systematic retirement
of bonds prior to their maturity. To carry out this requirement, the corporation
makes semiannual or annual payments that are used to retire bonds by pur-
chasing them in the marketplace.

Security Interest
The bond indenture identifies any collateral pledged
against the bond and specifies how it is to be maintained. The protection of bond
collateral is crucial to guarantee the safety of a bond issue.
Trustee
A trustee is a third party to a bond indenture. The trustee can be an individual, a
corporation, or (most often) a commercial bank trust department. The trustee is
paid to act as a “watchdog” on behalf of the bondholders and can take specified
actions on behalf of the bondholders if the terms of the indenture are violated.
COST OF BONDS TO THE ISSUER
The cost of bond financing is generally greater than the issuer would have to pay
for short-term borrowing. The major factors that affect the cost, which is the rate
of interest paid by the bond issuer, are the bond’s maturity, the size of the
offering, the issuer’s risk, and the basic cost of money.
Impact of Bond Maturity
Generally, as we noted earlier, long-term debt pays higher interest rates than
short-term debt. In a practical sense, the longer the maturity of a bond, the less
accuracy there is in predicting future interest rates, and therefore the greater the
bondholders’ risk of giving up an opportunity to lend money at a higher rate. In
addition, the longer the term, the greater the chance that the issuer might default.
Impact of Offering Size
The size of the bond offering also affects the interest cost of borrowing but in an
inverse manner: Bond flotation and administration costs per dollar borrowed are
likely to decrease with increasing offering size. On the other hand, the risk to the
bondholders may increase, because larger offerings result in greater risk of default.
Impact of Issuer’s Risk
The greater the issuer’s default risk, the higher the interest rate. Some of this risk
can be reduced through inclusion of appropriate restrictive provisions in the
bond indenture. Clearly, bondholders must be compensated with higher returns
for taking greater risk. Frequently, bond buyers rely on bond ratings (discussed
later) to determine the issuer’s overall risk.
Impact of the Cost of Money
The cost of money in the capital market is the basis for determining a bond’s
coupon interest rate. Generally, the rate on U.S. Treasury securities of equal
maturity is used as the lowest-risk cost of money. To that basic rate is added a risk
premium (as described earlier in this chapter) that reflects the factors mentioned
above (maturity, offering size, and issuer’s risk).
GENERAL FEATURES OF A BOND ISSUE
Three features sometimes included in a corporate bond issue are a conversion fea-
ture, a call feature, and stock purchase warrants. These features provide the
issuer or the purchaser with certain opportunities for replacing or retiring the
bond or supplementing it with some type of equity issue.
CHAPTER 6

trustee
A paid individual, corporation,
or commercial bank trust
department that acts as the
third party to a bond indenture
and can take specified actions
on behalf of the bondholders if
the terms of the indenture are
violated.

Convertible bonds offer a conversion feature that allows bondholders to
change each bond into a stated number of shares of common stock. Bondholders
convert their bonds into stock only when the market price of the stock is such
that conversion will provide a profit for the bondholder. Inclusion of the conver-
sion feature by the issuer lowers the interest cost and provides for automatic con-
version of the bonds to stock if future stock prices appreciate noticeably.
The call feature is included in nearly all corporate bond issues. It gives the issuer
the opportunity to repurchase bonds prior to maturity. The call price is the stated
price at which bonds may be repurchased prior to maturity. Sometimes the call 
feature can be exercised only during a certain period. As a rule, the call price exceeds
the par value of a bond by an amount equal to 1 year’s interest. For example, a
$1,000 bond with a 10 percent coupon interest rate would be callable for around
. The amount by which the call price
exceeds the bond’s par value is commonly referred to as the call premium. This
premium compensates bondholders for having the bond called away from them;
to the issuer, it is the cost of calling the bonds.
The call feature enables an issuer to call an outstanding bond when interest
rates fall and issue a new bond at a lower interest rate. When interest rates rise,
the call privilege will not be exercised, except possibly to meet sinking-fund
requirements. Of course, to sell a callable bond in the first place, the issuer must
pay a higher interest rate than on noncallable bonds of equal risk, to compensate
bondholders for the risk of having the bonds called away from them.
Bonds occasionally have stock purchase warrants attached as “sweeteners”
to make them more attractive to prospective buyers. Stock purchase warrants are
instruments that give their holders the right to purchase a certain number of
shares of the issuer’s common stock at a specified price over a certain period of
time. Their inclusion typically enables the issuer to pay a slightly lower coupon
interest rate than would otherwise be required.
BOND YIELDS
The yield, or rate of return, on a bond is frequently used to assess a bond’s per-
formance over a given period of time, typically 1 year. Because there are a number
of ways to measure a bond’s yield, it is important to understand popular yield
measures. The three most widely cited bond yields are (1) current yield, (2) yield
to maturity (YTM), and (3) yield to call (YTC). Each of these yields provides a
unique measure of the return on a bond.
The simplest yield measure is the current yield, the annual interest payment
divided by the current price. For example, a $1,000 par value bond with an 8 per-
cent coupon interest rate that currently sells for $970 would have a current yield
of
. This measure indicates the cash return for
the year from the bond. However, because current yield ignores any change in
bond value, it does not measure the total return. As we’ll see later in this chapter,
both the yield to maturity and the yield to call measure the total return.
BOND PRICES
Because most corporate bonds are purchased and held by institutional investors,
such as banks, insurance companies, and mutual funds, rather than individual
investors, bond trading and price data are not readily available to individuals.
Table 6.2 includes some assumed current data on the bonds of five companies,

in the table, we see that the bond has a coupon interest rate of 7.200 percent and a

The price represents the final price at which the bond traded on the current day.
Although most corporate bonds are issued with a par, or face, value of
$1,000, all bonds are quoted as a percentage of par. A $1,000-par-value bond
quoted at 94.007 is priced at $940.07 (

BOND RATINGS
Independent agencies such as Moody’s, Fitch, and Standard & Poor’s assess
the riskiness of publicly traded bond issues. These agencies derive their rat-
ings by using financial ratio and cash flow analyses to assess the likely pay-
ment of bond interest and principal. Table 6.3 summarizes these ratings. For

discussion of ethical issues related to the bond-rating agencies, see the Focus
on Ethics box.
Normally an inverse relationship exists between the quality of a bond and the
rate of return that it must provide bondholders: High-quality (high-rated) bonds
provide lower returns than lower-quality (low-rated) bonds. This reflects the
lender’s risk–return trade-off. When considering bond financing, the financial
manager must be concerned with the expected ratings of the bond issue, because
these ratings affect salability and cost.
COMMON TYPES OF BONDS
Bonds can be classified in a variety of ways. Here we break them into traditional
bonds (the basic types that have been around for years) and contemporary bonds
(newer, more innovative types). The traditional types of bonds are summarized in
terms of their key characteristics and priority of lender’s claim in Table 6.4. Note
that the first three types—debentures, subordinated debentures, and income
bonds—are unsecured, whereas the last three—mortgage bonds, collateral trust
bonds, and equipment trust certificates—are secured.
Table 6.5 (see page 238) describes the key characteristics of five contempo-
rary types of bonds: zero- (or low-) coupon bonds, junk bonds, floating-rate
bonds, extendible notes, and putable bonds. These bonds can be either unsecured
or secured. Changing capital market conditions and investor preferences have
spurred further innovations in bond financing in recent years and will probably
continue to do so.

Can We Trust the Bond Raters?
Moody’s Investors
Service, Standard &
Poor’s, and Fitch Ratings play a crucial
role in the financial markets. These
credit-rating agencies evaluate and
attach ratings to credit instruments (for
example, bonds). Historically, bonds
that received higher ratings were
almost always repaid, while lower-
rated, more speculative “junk” bonds
experienced much higher default rates.
The agencies’ ratings have a direct
impact on firms’ cost of raising external
capital and investors’ appraisals of
fixed-income investments.
Recently, the credit-rating agencies
have been criticized for their role in the
subprime crisis. The agencies attached
ratings to complex securities that did
not reflect the true risk of the underlying
investments. For example, securities
backed by mortgages issued to borrow-
ers with bad credit and no documented
income often received investment-grade

bility of default. However, when home
prices began to decline in 2006, secu-

It is not entirely clear why the rating
agencies assigned such high ratings 
to these securities. Did the agencies
believe that complex financial engineer-

the agencies understand the securities

influenced by the security issuers, who
also happened to pay for the ratings?
Apparently, some within the rating
agencies were suspicious. In a

INTERNATIONAL BOND ISSUES
Companies and governments borrow internationally by issuing bonds in two prin-
cipal financial markets: the Eurobond market and the foreign bond market. Both
give borrowers the opportunity to obtain large amounts of long-term debt
financing quickly, in the currency of their choice and with flexible repayment terms.
A Eurobond is issued by an international borrower and sold to investors in
countries with currencies other than the currency in which the bond is denomi-
nated. An example is a dollar-denominated bond issued by a U.S. corporation
and sold to Belgian investors. From the founding of the Eurobond market in the
1960s until the mid-1980s, “blue chip” U.S. corporations were the largest single
class of Eurobond issuers. Some of these companies were able to borrow in this
market at interest rates below those the U.S. government paid on Treasury bonds.
As the market matured, issuers became able to choose the currency in which they
borrowed, and European and Japanese borrowers rose to prominence. In more
recent years, the Eurobond market has become much more balanced in terms of
the mix of borrowers, total issue volume, and currency of denomination.

In contrast, a foreign bond is issued by a foreign corporation or government
and is denominated in the investor’s home currency and sold in the investor’s
home market. A Swiss-franc–denominated bond issued in Switzerland by a U.S.
company is an example of a foreign bond. The three largest foreign-bond markets
are Japan, Switzerland, and the United States.

coupon bonds
A significant portion (or all) of the investor’s return comes from gain in value (that is, par value minus
purchase price). Generally callable at par value. Because the issuer can annually deduct the current 
year’s interest accrual without having to pay the interest until the bond matures (or is called), its cash 
flow each year is increased by the amount of the tax shield provided by the interest deduction.
Junk bonds
Debt rated Ba or lower by Moody’s or BB or lower by Standard & Poor’s. Commonly used by rapidly
growing firms to obtain growth capital, most often as a way to finance mergers and takeovers. High-
risk bonds with high yields—often yielding 2% to 3% more than the best-quality corporate debt.
Floating-rate bonds
Stated interest rate is adjusted periodically within stated limits in response to changes in specified money
market or capital market rates. Popular when future inflation and interest rates are uncertain. Tend to
sell at close to par because of the automatic adjustment to changing market conditions. Some issues
provide for annual redemption at par at the option of the bondholder.
Extendible notes
Short maturities, typically 1 to 5 years, that can be renewed for a similar period at the option of 
holders. Similar to a floating-rate bond. An issue might be a series of 3-year renewable notes over a 
period of 15 years; every 3 years, the notes could be extended for another 3 years, at a new rate
competitive with market interest rates at the time of renewal.
Putable bonds
Bonds that can be redeemed at par (typically, $1,000) at the option of their holder either at specific 
dates after the date of issue and every 1 to 5 years thereafter or when and if the firm takes specified
actions, such as being acquired, acquiring another company, or issuing a large amount of additional 
debt. In return for its conferring the right to “put the bond” at specified times or when the firm takes 
certain actions, the bond’s yield is lower than that of a nonputable bond.

6.3 Valuation Fundamentals
Valuation is the process that links risk and return to determine the worth of an
asset. It is a relatively simple process that can be applied to expected streams of
benefits from bonds, stocks, income properties, oil wells, and so on. To determine
an asset’s worth at a given point in time, a financial manager uses the time-value-
of-money techniques presented in Chapter 5 and the concepts of risk and return
that we will develop in Chapter 8.
KEY INPUTS
There are three key inputs to the valuation process: (1) cash flows (returns), 
(2) timing, and (3) a measure of risk, which determines the required return. Each
is described below.
Cash Flows (Returns)
The value of any asset depends on the cash flow(s) it is expected to provide over
the ownership period. To have value, an asset does not have to provide an annual
cash flow; it can provide an intermittent cash flow or even a single cash flow over
the period.
Celia Sargent wishes to estimate the value of three assets she is
considering investing in: common stock in Michaels Enterprises,
an interest in an oil well, and an original painting by a well-known artist. Her cash
flow estimates for each are as follows:
Stock in Michaels Enterprises
Expect to receive cash dividends of $300 per
year indefinitely.
Oil well
Expect to receive cash flow of $2,000 at the end of year 1, $4,000
at the end of year 2, and $10,000 at the end of year 4, when the well is to be
sold.
Original painting
Expect to be able to sell the painting in 5 years for
$85,000.
With these cash flow estimates, Celia has taken the first step toward placing a
value on each of the assets.
Timing
In addition to making cash flow estimates, we must know the timing of the cash
flows.2 For example, Celia expects the cash flows of $2,000, $4,000, and
$10,000 for the oil well to occur at the ends of years 1, 2, and 4, respectively. The
combination of the cash flow and its timing fully defines the return expected from
the asset.

return to determine the worth

2. Although cash flows can occur at any time during a year, for computational convenience as well as custom, we
will assume they occur at the end of the year unless otherwise noted.
LG 4

Risk and Required Return
The level of risk associated with a given cash flow can significantly affect its
value. In general, the greater the risk of (or the less certain) a cash flow, the lower
its value. Greater risk can be incorporated into a valuation analysis by using a
higher required return or discount rate. The higher the risk, the greater the
required return, and the lower the risk, the less the required return.
Let’s return to Celia Sargent’s task of placing a value on the
original painting and consider two scenarios.
Scenario 1—Certainty
A major art gallery has contracted to buy the
painting for $85,000 at the end of 5 years. Because this is considered a cer-
tain situation, Celia views this asset as “money in the bank.” She thus would
use the prevailing risk-free rate of 3% as the required return when calculating
the value of the painting.
Scenario 2—High risk
The values of original paintings by this artist have
fluctuated widely over the past 10 years. Although Celia expects to be able to
sell the painting for $85,000, she realizes that its sale price in 5 years could
range between $30,000 and $140,000. Because of the high uncertainty sur-
rounding the painting’s value, Celia believes that a 15% required return is
appropriate.
These two estimates of the appropriate required return illustrate how this rate
captures risk. The often subjective nature of such estimates is also evident.
BASIC VALUATION MODEL
Simply stated, the value of any asset is the present value of all future cash flows it
is expected to provide over the relevant time period. The time period can be any
length, even infinity. The value of an asset is therefore determined by discounting
the expected cash flows back to their present value, using the required return
commensurate with the asset’s risk as the appropriate discount rate. Using the
present value techniques explained in Chapter 5, we can express the value of any
asset at time zero, V0, as
(6.4)
where
We can use Equation 6.4 to determine the value of any asset.
Celia Sargent uses Equation 6.4 to calculate the value of each
asset. She values Michaels Enterprises stock using Equation 5.14
on page 178, which says that the present value of a perpetuity equals the annual

payment divided by the required return. In the case of Michaels stock, the annual
cash flow is $300, and Celia decides that a 12% discount rate is appropriate for this
investment. Therefore, her estimate of the value of Michaels Enterprises stock is
Next, Celia values the oil well investment, which she believes is the most
risky of the three investments. Using a 20% required return, Celia estimates the
oil well’s value to be
Finally, Celia estimates the value of the painting by discounting the expected
$85,000 lump sum payment in 5 years at 15%:
Note that, regardless of the pattern of the expected cash flow from an asset, the
basic valuation equation can be used to determine its value.

6.4 Bond Valuation
The basic valuation equation can be customized for use in valuing specific securi-
ties: bonds, common stock, and preferred stock. We describe bond valuation in
this chapter, and valuation of common stock and preferred stock in Chapter 7.
BOND FUNDAMENTALS
As noted earlier in this chapter, bonds are long-term debt instruments used by
business and government to raise large sums of money, typically from a diverse
group of lenders. Most corporate bonds pay interest semiannually (every 6
months) at a stated coupon interest rate, have an initial maturity of 10 to 30 years,
and have a par value, or face value, of $1,000 that must be repaid at maturity.
Mills Company, a large defense contractor, on January 1, 2013, issued a 10%
coupon interest rate, 10-year bond with a $1,000 par value that pays interest
annually. Investors who buy this bond receive the contractual right to two cash
flows: (1) $100 annual interest (10% coupon interest rate
$1,000 par value)
distributed at the end of each year and (2) the $1,000 par value at the end of the
tenth year.

We will use data for Mills’s bond issue to look at basic bond valuation.
BASIC BOND VALUATION
The value of a bond is the present value of the payments its issuer is contractually
obligated to make, from the current time until it matures. The basic model for the
value, B0, of a bond is given by Equation 6.5:
(6.5)
where
We can calculate bond value by using Equation 6.5 and a financial calculator or
by using a spreadsheet.

Using the Mills Company’s inputs shown at the left, you should
find the bond value to be exactly $1,000. Note that the calculated bond value is
equal to its par value; this will always be the case when the required return is
equal to the coupon interest rate.3

The value of the Mills Company bond also can be calculated
as shown in the following Excel spreadsheet.

3. Note that because bonds pay interest in arrears, the prices at which they are quoted and traded reflect their value
plus any accrued interest. For example, a $1,000 par value, 10% coupon bond paying interest semiannually and
having a calculated value of $900 would pay interest of $50 at the end of each 6-month period. If it is now 3 months
since the beginning of the interest period, three-sixths of the $50 interest, or $25 (that is, 3/6
$50), would be
accrued. The bond would therefore be quoted at $925—its $900 value plus the $25 in accrued interest. For conven-
ience, throughout this book, bond values will always be assumed to be calculated at the beginning of the interest
period, thereby avoiding the need to consider accrued interest.

BOND VALUE BEHAVIOR
In practice, the value of a bond in the marketplace is rarely equal to its par value.
In the bond data (see Table 6.2 on page 235), you can see that the prices of bonds
often differ from their par values of 100 (100 percent of par, or $1,000). Some
bonds are valued below par (current price below 100), and others are valued
above par (current price above 100). A variety of forces in the economy, as well
as the passage of time, tend to affect value. Although these external forces are in
no way controlled by bond issuers or investors, it is useful to understand the
impact that required return and time to maturity have on bond value.
Required Returns and Bond Values
Whenever the required return on a bond differs from the bond’s coupon interest
rate, the bond’s value will differ from its par value. The required return is likely
to differ from the coupon interest rate because either (1) economic conditions
have changed, causing a shift in the basic cost of long-term funds; or (2) the firm’s
risk has changed. Increases in the basic cost of long-term funds or in risk will
raise the required return; decreases in the cost of funds or in risk will lower the
required return.

Regardless of the exact cause, what is important is the relationship between
the required return and the coupon interest rate: When the required return is
greater than the coupon interest rate, the bond value, B0, will be less than its par
value, M. In this case, the bond is said to sell at a discount, which will equal
. When the required return falls below the coupon interest rate, the bond
value will be greater than par. In this situation, the bond is said to sell at a
premium, which will equal 
.
The preceding example showed that when the required return equaled the
coupon interest rate, the bond’s value equaled its $1,000 par value. If for the
same bond the required return were to rise to 12% or fall to 8%, its value in each
case could be found using Equation 6.5 or as follows.
Calculator Use
Using the inputs shown at the left for the two different required
returns, you will find the value of the bond to be below or above par. At a 12%
required return, the bond would sell at a discount of $113.00 ($1,000 par
value
$887.00 value). At the 8% required return, the bond would sell for a
premium of $134.20 ($1,134.20 value
$1,000 par value). The results of these
calculations for Mills Company’s bond values are summarized in Table 6.6 and
graphically depicted in Figure 6.4. The inverse relationship between bond value
and required return is clearly shown in the figure.
Spreadsheet Use
The values for the Mills Company bond at required returns of
12% and 8% also can be calculated as shown in the following Excel spreadsheet.
Once this spreadsheet has been configured you can compare bond values for any
two required returns by simply changing the input values.

Time to Maturity and Bond Values
Whenever the required return is different from the coupon interest rate, the
amount of time to maturity affects bond value. An additional factor is whether
required returns are constant or change over the life of the bond.
Constant Required Returns
When the required return is different from the
coupon interest rate and is constant until maturity, the value of the bond will
approach its par value as the passage of time moves the bond’s value closer to
maturity. (Of course, when the required return equals the coupon interest rate,
the bond’s value will remain at par until it matures.)
Figure 6.5 depicts the behavior of the bond values calculated earlier and pre-
sented in Table 6.6 for Mills Company’s 10% coupon interest rate bond paying

returns—12%, 10%, and 8%—is assumed to remain constant over the 10 years
to the bond’s maturity. The bond’s value at both 12% and 8% approaches and
ultimately equals the bond’s $1,000 par value at its maturity, as the discount (at
12%) or premium (at 8%) declines with the passage of time.
Changing Required Returns
The chance that interest rates will change and
thereby change the required return and bond value is called interest rate risk.4
Bondholders are typically more concerned with rising interest rates because a rise
in interest rates, and therefore in the required return, causes a decrease in bond
value. The shorter the amount of time until a bond’s maturity, the less responsive
is its market value to a given change in the required return. In other words, short
maturities have less interest rate risk than long maturities when all other features
(coupon interest rate, par value, and interest payment frequency) are the same.
This is because of the mathematics of time value; the present values of short-term
cash flows change far less than the present values of longer-term cash flows in
response to a given change in the discount rate (required return).
The effect of changing required returns on bonds with differing maturities can be
illustrated by using Mills Company’s bond and Figure 6.5. If the required return
rises from 10% to 12% when the bond has 8 years to maturity (see the dashed
line at 8 years), the bond’s value decreases from $1,000 to $901—a 9.9%
decrease. If the same change in required return had occurred with only 3 years to

4. A more robust measure of a bond’s response to interest rate changes is duration. Duration measures the sensitivity
of a bond’s prices to changing interest rates. It incorporates both the interest rate (coupon rate) and the time to
maturity into a single statistic. Duration is simply a weighted average of the maturity of the present values of all the
contractual cash flows yet to be paid by the bond. Duration is stated in years, so a bond with a 5-year duration will
decrease in value by 5 percent if interest rates rise by 1 percent or will increase in value by 5 percent if interest rates
fall by 1 percent.

just $952—only a 4.8% decrease. Similar types of responses can be seen for the
change in bond value associated with decreases in required returns. The shorter
the time to maturity, the less the impact on bond value caused by a given change
in the required return.
YIELD TO MATURITY (YTM)
When investors evaluate bonds, they commonly consider yield to maturity
(YTM). This is the compound annual rate of return earned on a debt security
purchased on a given day and held to maturity. (The measure assumes, of course,
that the issuer makes all scheduled interest and principal payments as promised.)5
The yield to maturity on a bond with a current price equal to its par value (that
is, 
) will always equal the coupon interest rate. When the bond value dif-
fers from par, the yield to maturity will differ from the coupon interest rate.
Assuming that interest is paid annually, the yield to maturity on a bond can
be found by solving Equation 6.5 for rd. In other words, the current value, the
annual interest, the par value, and the number of years to maturity are known,
and the required return must be found. The required return is the bond’s yield to
maturity. The YTM can be found by using a financial calculator, by using an
Excel spreadsheet, or by trial and error. The calculator provides accurate YTM
values with minimum effort.
Earl Washington wishes to find the YTM on Mills Company’s
bond. The bond currently sells for $1,080, has a 10% coupon
interest rate and $1,000 par value, pays interest annually, and has 10 years to
maturity.
Calculator Use
Most calculators require either the present value (B0 in this
case) or the future values (I and M in this case) to be input as negative numbers to
calculate yield to maturity. That approach is employed here. Using the inputs
shown at the left, you should find the YTM to be 8.766%.
Spreadsheet Use
The yield to maturity of Mills Company’s bond also can be
calculated as shown in the following Excel spreadsheet. First, enter all the bond’s
cash flows. Notice that you begin with the bond’s price as an outflow (a negative
number). In other words, an investor has to pay the price up front to receive the
cash flows over the next 10 years. Next, use Excel’s internal rate of return func-
tion. This function calculates the discount rate that makes the present value of a
series of cash flows equal to zero. In this case, when the present value of all cash
flows is zero, the present value of the inflows (interest and principal) equals the
present value of the outflows (the bond’s initial price). In other words, the
internal rate of return function is giving us the bond’s YTM, the discount rate
that equates the bond’s price to the present value of its cash flows.

5. Many bonds have a call feature, which means they may not reach maturity if the issuer, after a specified time
period, calls them back. Because the call feature typically cannot be exercised until a specific future date, investors
often calculate the yield to call (YTC). The yield to call represents the rate of return that investors earn if they buy a
callable bond at a specific price and hold it until it is called back and they receive the call price, which would be set
above the bond’s par value. Here our focus is solely on the more general measure of yield to maturity.

SEMIANNUAL INTEREST AND BOND VALUES
The procedure used to value bonds paying interest semiannually is similar to that
shown in Chapter 5 for compounding interest more frequently than annually,
except that here we need to find present value instead of future value. It involves
1. Converting annual interest, I, to semiannual interest by dividing I by 2.
2. Converting the number of years to maturity, n, to the number of 6-month
periods to maturity by multiplying n by 2.
3. Converting the required stated (rather than effective)6 annual return for 
similar-risk bonds that also pay semiannual interest from an annual rate, rd,
to a semiannual rate by dividing rd by 2.
Substituting these three changes into Equation 6.5 yields

For example, a bond with a 12% required stated annual return, rd, that pays semiannual interest would have an
effective annual rate of
Because most bonds pay semiannual interest at semiannual rates equal to 50 percent of the stated annual rate, their
effective annual rates are generally higher than their stated annual rates.

Assuming that the Mills Company bond pays interest semiannually and that the

Calculator Use
In using a calculator to find bond value when interest is paid
semiannually, we must double the number of periods and divide both the required
stated annual return and the annual interest by 2. For the Mills Company bond,
we would use 20 periods (2
10 years), a required return of 6% (12%

an interest payment of $50 ($100

bond value with semiannual interest to be $885.30, as shown at the left.

PART 3
Valuation of Securities
Summary
FOCUS ON VALUE
Interest rates and required returns embody the real cost of money, inflationary
expectations, and issuer and issue risk. They reflect the level of return required
by market participants as compensation for the risk perceived in a specific secu-
rity or asset investment. Because these returns are affected by economic expecta-
tions, they vary as a function of time, typically rising for longer-term maturities.
The yield curve reflects such market expectations at any point in time.
The value of an asset can be found by calculating the present value of its
expected cash flows, using the required return as the discount rate. Bonds are
the easiest financial assets to value; both the amounts and the timing of their
cash flows are contractual and, therefore, known with certainty (at least for
high-grade bonds). The financial manager needs to understand how to apply
valuation techniques to bonds, stocks, and tangible assets (as we will demon-
strate in the following chapters) to make decisions that are consistent with the
firm’s share price maximization goal.
REVIEW OF LEARNING GOALS
Describe interest rate fundamentals, the term structure of interest rates,
and risk premiums. The flow of funds between savers and borrowers is regu-
lated by the interest rate or required return. In a perfect, inflation-free, certain
world there would be one cost of money—the real rate of interest. The nominal
or actual interest rate is the sum of the risk-free rate and a risk premium
reflecting issuer and issue characteristics. The risk-free rate is the real rate of
interest plus an inflation premium.
For any class of similar-risk bonds, the term structure of interest rates
reflects the relationship between the interest rate or rate of return and the time
to maturity. Yield curves can be downward sloping (inverted), upward sloping
(normal), or flat. The expectations theory, liquidity preference theory, and
market segmentation theory are cited to explain the shape of the yield curve.
Risk premiums for non-Treasury debt issues result from business risk, financial
risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, tax risk, default risk, maturity risk, and
contractual provision risk.
Review the legal aspects of bond financing and bond cost. Corporate
bonds are long-term debt instruments indicating that a corporation has 
borrowed an amount that it promises to repay in the future under clearly
defined terms. Most bonds are issued with maturities of 10 to 30 years and a
par value of $1,000. The bond indenture, enforced by a trustee, states all 
conditions of the bond issue. It contains both standard debt provisions and
LG 2
LG 1

restrictive covenants, which may include a sinking-fund requirement and/or a
security interest. The cost of a bond to an issuer depends on its maturity,
offering size, and issuer risk and on the basic cost of money.
Discuss the general features, yields, prices, ratings, popular types, and
international issues of corporate bonds. A bond issue may include a conversion
feature, a call feature, or stock purchase warrants. The yield, or rate of return,
on a bond can be measured by its current yield, yield to maturity (YTM), or
yield to call (YTC). Bond prices are typically reported along with their coupon,
maturity date, and yield to maturity (YTM). Bond ratings by independent agencies
indicate the risk of a bond issue. Various types of traditional and contemporary
bonds are available. Eurobonds and foreign bonds enable established creditworthy
companies and governments to borrow large amounts internationally.
Understand the key inputs and basic model used in the valuation
process. Key inputs to the valuation process include cash flows (returns), timing,
and risk and the required return. The value of any asset is equal to the present
value of all future cash flows it is expected to provide over the relevant time
period.
Apply the basic valuation model to bonds, and describe the impact of
required return and time to maturity on bond values. The value of a bond is the
present value of its interest payments plus the present value of its par value. The
discount rate used to determine bond value is the required return, which may
differ from the bond’s coupon interest rate. A bond can sell at a discount, at par,
or at a premium, depending on whether the required return is greater than,
equal to, or less than its coupon interest rate. The amount of time to maturity
affects bond values. The value of a bond will approach its par value as the bond
moves closer to maturity. The chance that interest rates will change and thereby
change the required return and bond value is called interest rate risk. The
shorter the amount of time until a bond’s maturity, the less responsive is its
market value to a given change in the required return.
Explain yield to maturity (YTM), its calculation, and the procedure used
to value bonds that pay interest semiannually. Yield to maturity is the rate of
return investors earn if they buy a bond at a specific price and hold it until
maturity. YTM can be calculated by using a financial calculator or by using an
Excel spreadsheet. Bonds that pay interest semiannually are valued by using the
same procedure used to value bonds paying annual interest, except that the
interest payments are one-half of the annual interest payments, the number of
periods is twice the number of years to maturity, and the required return is one-
half of the stated annual required return on similar-risk bonds.

Opener-in-Review
In the chapter opener you learned that the United States government had 
more than $13 trillion in debt outstanding in the form of Treasury bills, notes,
and bonds in 2010. From time to time, the Treasury changes the mix of 

securities that it issues to finance government debt, issuing more bills than
bonds or vice versa.
a. With short-term interest rates near 0 percent in 2010, suppose the Treasury
decided to replace maturing notes and bonds by issuing new Treasury bills, thus
shortening the average maturity of U.S. debt outstanding. Discuss the pros and
cons of this strategy.
b. The average maturity of outstanding U.S. Treasury debt is about 5 years.
Suppose a newly issued 5-year Treasury note has a coupon rate of 2 percent and
sells at par. What happens to the value of this bond if the inflation rate rises 
1 percentage point, causing the yield-to-maturity on the 5-year note to jump to 
3 percent shortly after it is issued?
c. Assume that the “average” Treasury security outstanding has the features
described in part b. If total U.S. debt is $13 trillion and an increase in inflation
causes yields on Treasury securities to increase by 1 percentage point, by how
much would the market value of the outstanding debt fall? What does this sug-
gest about the incentives of government policy makers to pursue policies that
could lead to higher inflation?

ETHICS PROBLEM
Bond rating agencies have invested significant sums of money
in an effort to determine which quantitative and nonquantitative factors best predict
bond defaults. Furthermore, some of the raters invest time and money to meet pri-
vately with corporate personnel to get nonpublic information that is used in
assigning the issue’s bond rating. To recoup those costs, some bond rating agencies
have tied their ratings to the purchase of additional services. Do you believe that this
is an acceptable practice? Defend your position.

Why This Chapter Matters to You
In your professional life
ACCOUNTING You need to understand the difference between debt
and equity in terms of tax treatment; the ownership claims of capital
providers, including venture capitalists and stockholders; and the 
differences between book value per share and other market-based 
valuations.
INFORMATION SYSTEMS You need to understand the procedures
used to issue common stock, the information needed to value stock,
how to collect and process the necessary information from each func-
tional area, and how to disseminate information to investors.
MANAGEMENT You need to understand the difference between debt
and equity capital, the rights and claims of stockholders, the process of
issuing common stock, and the effects each functional area has on the
value of the firm’s stock.
MARKETING You need to understand that the firm’s ideas for products
and services will greatly affect investors’ beliefs regarding the likely
success of the firm’s projects; projects that are viewed as more likely to
succeed are also viewed as more valuable and therefore lead to a
higher stock value.
OPERATIONS You need to understand that the evaluations of venture
capitalists and other would-be investors will in part depend on the effi-
ciency of the firm’s operations; more cost-efficient operations lead to
better growth prospects and, therefore, higher stock valuations.
At some point, you are likely to hold
stocks as an asset in your retirement
program. You may want to estimate a stock’s value. If the stock is
selling below its estimated value, you may buy the stock; if its market
price is above its value, you may sell it. Some individuals rely on finan-
cial advisors to make such buy or sell recommendations. Regardless of
how you approach investment decisions, it will be helpful for you to
understand how stocks are valued.

Going Green to Find Value
O
ne of the most “hotly” debated
topics of our day has been the
issue of global warming and the benefits
and costs of lower emissions. Many
companies are investing in radical new
technologies with the hope of capital-
izing on the going green movement. On September 24, 2009, A123 Systems Inc. raised
$378 million in its initial public offering (IPO) of common stock. A123, whose shares trade on
the Nasdaq stock exchange, uses a patented nanotechnology developed at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology to produce more powerful and longer-lasting lithium ion batteries that go
in products ranging from cordless hand tools to electric vehicles. Even though A123 reported a
loss of $40.7 million on revenue of just $42.9 million in the first half of 2009, investors wel-
comed the IPO, boosting the share price 50 percent on the first day of trading.
Excitement about A123’s prospects was fueled in part by major investments in the com-
pany from a few high-profile companies including General Electric, Qualcomm, and Motorola.
Furthermore, the company secured almost $250 million in grants from the federal government as
part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a bill passed by Congress
designed to help the U.S. economy emerge from a deep recession. Some likely customers of
A123 also received stimulus funds, including electric car makers Tesla Motors and Fisker
Automotive. In the weeks following the IPO, A123’s stock price was as high as $28 per share,
but by the middle of 2010 it was trading below $10 a share. A123 is not a stock for the faint
of heart. In the long run, A123’s stock price will depend on its ability to generate positive cash
flows and convince the market of its ability to do so into the future.

7.1 Differences between Debt and Equity
Although debt and equity capital are both sources of external financing used by
firms, they are very different in several important respects. Most importantly,
debt financing is obtained from creditors, and equity financing is obtained from
investors who then become part owners of the firm. Creditors (lenders or
debtholders) have a legal right to be repaid, whereas investors have only an
expectation of being repaid. Debt includes all borrowing incurred by a firm,
including bonds, and is repaid according to a fixed schedule of payments. Equity
consists of funds provided by the firm’s owners (investors or stockholders) and is
repaid subject to the firm’s performance. A firm can obtain equity either
internally, by retaining earnings rather than paying them out as dividends to its
stockholders, or externally, by selling common or preferred stock. The key differ-
ences between debt and equity capital are summarized in Table 7.1 and discussed
in the following pages.
VOICE IN MANAGEMENT
Unlike creditors, holders of equity (stockholders) are owners of the firm. Stockholders
generally have voting rights that permit them to select the firm’s directors and vote
on special issues. In contrast, debtholders do not receive voting privileges but
instead rely on the firm’s contractual obligations to them to be their voice.
CLAIMS ON INCOME AND ASSETS
Equityholders’ claims on income and assets are secondary to the claims of credi-
tors. Their claims on income cannot be paid until the claims of all creditors,
including both interest and scheduled principal payments, have been satisfied.
After satisfying creditor’s claims, the firm’s board of directors decides whether to
distribute dividends to the owners.
debt
Includes all borrowing incurred
by a firm, including bonds,
and is repaid according to a

equity
Funds provided by the 
firm’s owners (investors or
stockholders) that are repaid
subject to the firm’s
performance.
Equityholders’ claims on assets also are secondary to the claims of creditors.
If the firm fails, its assets are sold, and the proceeds are distributed in this order:
secured creditors, unsecured creditors, and equityholders. Because equityholders
are the last to receive any distribution of assets, they expect greater returns from
their investment in the firm’s stock than the returns creditors require on the firm’s
Matter of fact
A
ccording to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, in bankruptcy assets are divided
up as follows:
1. Secured creditors: Secured bank loans or secured bonds are paid first.
2. Unsecured creditors: Unsecured bank loans or unsecured bonds, suppliers, or customers
have the next claim.
3. Equityholders: Equityholders or the owners of the company have the last claim on assets,
and they may not receive anything if the secured and unsecured creditors’ claims are not
fully repaid.

borrowings. The higher rate of return expected by equityholders leads to a higher
cost of equity financing relative to the cost of debt financing for the firm.
MATURITY
Unlike debt, equity is a permanent form of financing for the firm. It does not
“mature,” so repayment is not required. Because equity is liquidated only during
bankruptcy proceedings, stockholders must recognize that, although a ready
market may exist for their shares, the price that can be realized may fluctuate.
This fluctuation of the market price of equity makes the overall returns to a firm’s
stockholders even more risky.
TAX TREATMENT
Interest payments to debtholders are treated as tax-deductible expenses by the
issuing firm, whereas dividend payments to a firm’s stockholders are not tax
deductible. The tax deductibility of interest lowers the corporation’s cost of debt
financing, further causing it to be lower than the cost of equity financing.

TABLE 7.1
7.2 Common and Preferred Stock
A firm can obtain equity capital by selling either common or preferred stock. All
corporations initially issue common stock to raise equity capital. Some of these
firms later issue either additional common stock or preferred stock to raise more
equity capital. Although both common and preferred stock are forms of equity
capital, preferred stock has some similarities to debt that significantly differen-
tiate it from common stock. Here we first consider the features of both common
and preferred stock and then describe the process of issuing common stock,
including the use of venture capital.
LG 3
LG 2

COMMON STOCK
The true owners of a corporate business are the common stockholders. Common
stockholders are sometimes referred to as residual owners because they receive
what is left—the residual—after all other claims on the firm’s income and assets
have been satisfied. They are assured of only one thing: that they cannot lose any
more than they have invested in the firm. As a result of this generally uncertain
position, common stockholders expect to be compensated with adequate divi-
dends and, ultimately, capital gains.
Ownership
The common stock of a firm can be privately owned by private investors or publicly
owned by public investors. Private companies are often closely owned by an indi-
vidual investor or a small group of private investors (such as a family). Public com-
panies are widely owned by many unrelated individual or institutional investors.
The shares of privately owned firms, which are typically small corporations, are gen-
erally not traded; if the shares are traded, the transactions are among private
investors and often require the firm’s consent. Large corporations, which are empha-
sized in the following discussions, are publicly owned, and their shares are generally
actively traded in the broker or dealer markets described in Chapter 2.
Par Value
The market value of common stock is completely unrelated to its par value. The
par value of common stock is an arbitrary value established for legal purposes in
the firm’s corporate charter and is generally set quite low, often an amount of $1
or less. Recall that when a firm sells new shares of common stock, the par value
of the shares sold is recorded in the capital section of the balance sheet as part of
common stock. One benefit of this recording is that at any time the total number
of shares of common stock outstanding can be found by dividing the book value
of common stock by the par value.
Setting a low par value is advantageous in states where certain corporate taxes
are based on the par value of stock. A low par value is also beneficial in states that
have laws against selling stock at a discount to par. For example, a company
whose common stock has a par value of $20 per share would be unable to issue
stock if investors are unwilling to pay more than $16 per share.
Preemptive Rights
The preemptive right allows common stockholders to maintain their proportionate
ownership in the corporation when new shares are issued, thus protecting them
from dilution of their ownership. A dilution of ownership is a reduction in each
previous shareholder’s fractional ownership resulting from the issuance of
additional shares of common stock. Preemptive rights allow preexisting share-
holders to maintain their preissuance voting control and protects them against
the dilution of earnings. Preexisting shareholders experience a dilution of earn-
ings when their claim on the firm’s earnings is diminished as a result of new
shares being issued.
In a rights offering, the firm grants rights to its shareholders. These financial
instruments allow stockholders to purchase additional shares at a price below
the market price, in direct proportion to their number of owned shares. In these

situations, rights are an important financing tool without which shareholders
would run the risk of losing their proportionate control of the corporation. From
the firm’s viewpoint, the use of rights offerings to raise new equity capital may be
less costly than a public offering of stock.
Authorized, Outstanding, and Issued Shares
A firm’s corporate charter indicates how many authorized shares it can issue. The
firm cannot sell more shares than the charter authorizes without obtaining
approval through a shareholder vote. To avoid later having to amend the charter,
firms generally attempt to authorize more shares than they initially plan to issue.
Authorized shares become outstanding shares when they are issued or sold to
investors. If the firm repurchases any of its outstanding shares, these shares are
recorded as treasury stock and are no longer considered to be outstanding shares.
Issued shares are the shares of common stock that have been put into circulation;
they represent the sum of outstanding shares and treasury stock.
Golden Enterprises, a producer of medical pumps, has the following stock-
holders’ equity account on December 31:

How many shares of additional common stock can Golden sell without
gaining approval from its shareholders? The firm has 35 million authorized
shares, 15 million issued shares, and 1 million shares of treasury stock. Thus 14
million shares are outstanding (15 million issued shares minus 1 million shares of
treasury stock), and Golden can issue 21 million additional shares (35 million
authorized shares minus 14 million outstanding shares) without seeking share-
holder approval. This total includes the treasury shares currently held, which the
firm can reissue to the public without obtaining shareholder approval.
Voting Rights
Generally, each share of common stock entitles its holder to one vote in the elec-
tion of directors and on special issues. Votes are generally assignable and may be
cast at the annual stockholders’ meeting.
Because most small stockholders do not attend the annual meeting to vote,
they may sign a proxy statement transferring their votes to another party. The
solicitation of proxies from shareholders is closely controlled by the Securities
and Exchange Commission to ensure that proxies are not being solicited on the

basis of false or misleading information. Existing management generally receives
the stockholders’ proxies because it is able to solicit them at company expense.
Occasionally, when the firm is widely owned, outsiders may wage a proxy
battle to unseat the existing management and gain control of the firm. To win a cor-
porate election, votes from a majority of the shares voted are required. However, the
odds of an outside group winning a proxy battle are generally slim.
In recent years, many firms have issued two or more classes of common stock
with unequal voting rights. A firm can use different classes of stock as a defense
against a hostile takeover in which an outside group, without management sup-
port, tries to gain voting control of the firm by buying its shares in the market-
place. Supervoting shares, which have multiple votes per share, allow “insiders”
to maintain control against an outside group whose shares have only one vote
each. At other times, a class of nonvoting common stock is issued when the firm
wishes to raise capital through the sale of common stock but does not want to
give up its voting control.
When different classes of common stock are issued on the basis of unequal
voting rights, class A common typically—but not universally—has one vote per
share, and class B common has supervoting rights. In most cases, the multiple
share classes are equal with respect to all other aspects of ownership, although
there are some exceptions to this general rule. In particular, there is usually no
difference in the distribution of earnings (dividends) and assets. Treasury stock,
which is held within the corporation, generally does not have voting rights, does
not earn dividends, and does not have a claim on assets in liquidation.
Dividends
The payment of dividends to the firm’s shareholders is at the discretion of the
company’s board of directors. Most corporations that pay dividends pay them
quarterly. Dividends may be paid in cash, stock, or merchandise. Cash dividends
are the most common, merchandise dividends the least.
Common stockholders are not promised a dividend, but they come to expect
certain payments on the basis of the historical dividend pattern of the firm.
Before firms pay dividends to common stockholders, they must pay any past due
dividends owed to preferred stockholders. The firm’s ability to pay dividends can
be affected by restrictive debt covenants designed to ensure that the firm can
repay its creditors.
Since passage of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003,
many firms now pay larger dividends to shareholders, who are subject to a max-
imum tax rate of 15 percent on dividends rather than the maximum tax rate of
39 percent in effect prior to passage of the act. Because of the importance of the
dividend decision to the growth and valuation of the firm, dividends are dis-
cussed in greater detail in Chapter 14.
International Stock Issues
Although the international market for common stock is not as large as the inter-
national market for bonds, cross-border issuance and trading of common stock
have increased dramatically in the past 30 years.
Some corporations issue stock in foreign markets. For example, the stock of
General Electric trades in Frankfurt, London, Paris, and Tokyo; the stocks of Time
Warner and Microsoft trade in Frankfurt and London; and the stock of McDonalds

trades in Frankfurt, London, and Paris. The Frankfurt, London, and Tokyo mar-
kets are the most popular. Issuing stock internationally broadens the ownership
base and helps a company to integrate into the local business environment.
Having locally traded stock can facilitate corporate acquisitions because shares
can be used as an acceptable method of payment.
Foreign corporations have also discovered the benefits of trading their stock
in the United States. The disclosure and reporting requirements mandated by the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have historically discouraged all but
the largest foreign firms from directly listing their shares on the New York Stock
Exchange or the American Stock Exchange.
As an alternative, most foreign companies choose to tap the U.S. market
through American depositary shares (ADSs). These are dollar-denominated
receipts for the stocks of foreign companies that are held by a U.S. financial insti-
tution overseas. They serve as backing for American depositary receipts (ADRs),
which are securities that permit U.S. investors to hold shares of non-U.S. compa-
nies and trade them in U.S. markets. Because ADRs are issued, in dollars, to U.S.
investors, they are subject to U.S. securities laws. At the same time, they give
investors the opportunity to diversify their portfolios internationally.
PREFERRED STOCK
Preferred stock gives its holders certain privileges that make them senior to
common stockholders. Preferred stockholders are promised a fixed periodic divi-
dend, which is stated either as a percentage or as a dollar amount. How the divi-
dend is specified depends on whether the preferred stock has a par value.
Par-value preferred stock has a stated face value, and its annual dividend is spec-
ified as a percentage of this value. No-par preferred stock has no stated face
value, but its annual dividend is stated in dollars. Preferred stock is most often
issued by public utilities, by acquiring firms in merger transactions, and by firms
that are experiencing losses and need additional financing.
Basic Rights of Preferred Stockholders
The basic rights of preferred stockholders are somewhat stronger than the rights
of common stockholders. Preferred stock is often considered quasi-debt because,
much like interest on debt, it specifies a fixed periodic payment (dividend).
Preferred stock is unlike debt in that it has no maturity date. Because they have a
fixed claim on the firm’s income that takes precedence over the claim of common
stockholders, preferred stockholders are exposed to less risk.
Preferred stockholders are also given preference over common stockholders in
the liquidation of assets in a legally bankrupt firm, although they must “stand in
line” behind creditors. The amount of the claim of preferred stockholders in liqui-
dation is normally equal to the par or stated value of the preferred stock. Preferred
stockholders are not normally given a voting right, although preferred stock-
holders are sometimes allowed to elect one member of the board of directors.
Features of Preferred Stock
A preferred stock issue generally includes a number of features, which, along
with the stock’s par value, the amount of dividend payments, the dividend pay-
ment dates, and any restrictive covenants, are specified in an agreement similar to
a bond indenture.

Restrictive Covenants
The restrictive covenants in a preferred stock issue
focus on ensuring the firm’s continued existence and regular payment of the divi-
dend. These covenants include provisions about passing dividends, the sale of senior
securities, mergers, sales of assets, minimum liquidity requirements, and repurchases
of common stock. The violation of preferred stock covenants usually permits pre-
ferred stockholders either to obtain representation on the firm’s board of directors
or to force the retirement of their stock at or above its par or stated value.
Cumulation
Most preferred stock is cumulative with respect to any divi-
dends passed. That is, all dividends in arrears, along with the current dividend,
must be paid before dividends can be paid to common stockholders. If preferred
stock is noncumulative, passed (unpaid) dividends do not accumulate. In this
case, only the current dividend must be paid before dividends can be paid to
common stockholders. Because the common stockholders can receive dividends
only after the dividend claims of preferred stockholders have been satisfied, it is
in the firm’s best interest to pay preferred dividends when they are due.
Other Features
Preferred stock can be callable or convertible. Preferred
stock with a callable feature allows the issuer to retire outstanding shares within
a certain period of time at a specified price. The call price is normally set above
the initial issuance price, but it may decrease as time passes. Making preferred
stock callable provides the issuer with a way to bring the fixed-payment commit-
ment of the preferred issue to an end if conditions make it desirable to do so.
Preferred stock with a conversion feature allows holders to change each share
into a stated number of shares of common stock, usually anytime after a prede-
termined date. The conversion ratio can be fixed, or the number of shares of
common stock that the preferred stock can be exchanged for changes through
time according to a predetermined formula.
ISSUING COMMON STOCK
Because of the high risk associated with a business startup, a firm’s initial
financing typically comes from its founders in the form of a common stock
investment. Until the founders have made an equity investment, it is highly
unlikely that others will contribute either equity or debt capital. Early-stage
investors in the firm’s equity, as well as lenders who provide debt capital, want to
be assured that they are taking no more risk than the founders. In addition, they
want confirmation that the founders are confident enough in their vision for the
firm that they are willing to risk their own money.
Typically, the initial nonfounder financing for business startups with attrac-
tive growth prospects comes from private equity investors. Then, as the firm
establishes the viability of its product or service offering and begins to generate
revenues, cash flow, and profits, it will often “go public” by issuing shares of
common stock to a much broader group of investors.
Before we consider the initial public sale of equity, let’s discuss some of the key
aspects of early-stage equity financing in firms that have attractive growth prospects.
Venture Capital
The initial external equity financing privately raised by firms, typically early-
stage firms with attractive growth prospects, is called venture capital. Those who

provide venture capital are known as venture capitalists (VCs). They typically are
formal business entities that maintain strong oversight over the firms they invest
in and that have clearly defined exit strategies. Less visible early-stage investors
called angel capitalists (or angels) tend to be investors who do not actually
operate as a business; they are often wealthy individual investors who are willing
to invest in promising early-stage companies in exchange for a portion of the
firm’s equity. Although angels play a major role in early-stage equity financing,
we will focus on VCs because of their more formal structure and greater public
visibility.
Organization and Investment Stages
Venture capital investors tend to be
organized in one of four basic ways, as described in Table 7.2. The VC limited
partnership is by far the dominant structure. These funds have as their sole objec-
tive to earn high returns, rather than to obtain access to the companies in order to
sell or buy other products or services.
VCs can invest in early-stage companies, later-stage companies, or buyouts
and acquisitions. Generally, about 40 to 50 percent of VC investments are
devoted to early-stage companies (for startup funding and expansion) and a sim-
ilar percentage to later-stage companies (for marketing, production expansion,
and preparation for public offering); the remaining 5 to 10 percent are devoted to
the buyout or acquisition of other companies. Generally, VCs look for compound
annual rates of return ranging from 20 to 50 percent or more, depending on both
the development stage and the attributes of each company. Earlier-stage invest-
ments tend to demand higher returns than later-stage investments because of the
higher risk associated with the earlier stages of a firm’s growth.
Deal Structure and Pricing
Regardless of the development stage, venture
capital investments are made under a legal contract that clearly allocates respon-
sibilities and ownership interests between existing owners (founders) and the VC
fund or limited partnership. The terms of the agreement will depend on numerous

factors related to the founders; the business structure, stage of development, and
outlook; and other market and timing issues. The specific financial terms will, of
course, depend on the value of the enterprise, the amount of funding, and the per-
ceived risk. To control the VC’s risk, various covenants are included in the agree-
ment, and the actual funding may be pegged to the achievement of measurable
milestones. The VC will negotiate numerous other provisions into the contract,
both to ensure the firm’s success and to control its risk exposure. The contract
will have an explicit exit strategy for the VC that may be tied both to measurable
milestones and to time.
The amount of equity to which the VC is entitled will, of course, depend on
the value of the firm, the terms of the contract, the exit terms, and the minimum
compound annual rate of return required by the VC on its investment. Although
each VC investment is unique and no standard contract exists, the transaction
will be structured to provide the VC with a high rate of return that is consistent
with the typically high risk of such transactions. The exit strategy of most VC
investments is to take the firm public through an initial public offering.
Going Public
When a firm wishes to sell its stock in the primary market, it has three alterna-
tives. It can make (1) a public offering, in which it offers its shares for sale to the
general public; (2) a rights offering, in which new shares are sold to existing
stockholders; or (3) a private placement, in which the firm sells new securities
directly to an investor or group of investors. Here we focus on public offerings,
particularly the initial public offering (IPO), which is the first public sale of a
firm’s stock. IPOs are typically made by small, rapidly growing companies that
either require additional capital to continue expanding or have met a milestone
for going public that was established in a contract signed earlier in order to
obtain VC funding.
To go public, the firm must first obtain the approval of its current share-
holders, the investors who own its privately issued stock. Next, the company’s
auditors and lawyers must certify that all documents for the company are legiti-
mate. The company then finds an investment bank willing to underwrite the
offering. This underwriter is responsible for promoting the stock and facilitating
the sale of the company’s IPO shares. The underwriter often brings in other
investment banking firms as participants. We’ll discuss the role of the investment
banker in more detail in the next section.
The company files a registration statement with the SEC. One portion of the
registration statement is called the prospectus. It describes the key aspects of the
issue, the issuer, and its management and financial position. During the waiting
period between the statement’s filing and its approval, prospective investors can
receive a preliminary prospectus. This preliminary version is called a red herring,
because a notice printed in red on the front cover indicates the tentative nature of
the offer. The cover of the preliminary prospectus describing the 2010 stock issue
of Convio, Inc., is shown in Figure 7.1. Note the red herring printed across the
top of the page.
After the SEC approves the registration statement, the investment community
can begin analyzing the company’s prospects. However, from the time it files until
at least one month after the IPO is complete, the company must observe a quiet
period, during which there are restrictions on what company officials may say

about the company. The purpose of the quiet period is to make sure that all
potential investors have access to the same information about the company—the
information presented in the preliminary prospectus—and not to any unpub-
lished data that might give them an unfair advantage.
The investment bankers and company executives promote the company’s stock
offering through a road show, a series of presentations to potential investors
around the country and sometimes overseas. In addition to providing investors
with information about the new issue, road show sessions help the investment
bankers gauge the demand for the offering and set an expected pricing range. After
the underwriter sets terms and prices the issue, the SEC must approve the offering.
The Investment Banker’s Role
Most public offerings are made with the assistance of an investment banker. The
investment banker is a financial intermediary (such as Morgan Stanley or
Goldman Sachs) that specializes in selling new security issues and advising firms
with regard to major financial transactions. The main activity of the investment
banker is underwriting. This process involves purchasing the security issue from
the issuing corporation at an agreed-on price and bearing the risk of reselling it to
the public at a profit. The investment banker also provides the issuer with advice
about pricing and other important aspects of the issue.

In the case of very large security issues, the investment banker brings in other
bankers as partners to form an underwriting syndicate. The syndicate shares the
financial risk associated with buying the entire issue from the issuer and reselling
the new securities to the public. The originating investment banker and the syndi-
cate members put together a selling group, normally made up of themselves and a
large number of brokerage firms. Each member of the selling group accepts the
responsibility for selling a certain portion of the issue and is paid a commission on the
securities it sells. The selling process for a large security issue is depicted in Figure 7.2.
Compensation for underwriting and selling services typically comes in the
form of a discount on the sale price of the securities. For example, an investment
banker may pay the issuing firm $24 per share for stock that will be sold for $26
per share. The investment banker may then sell the shares to members of the
selling group for $25.25 per share. In this case, the original investment banker
earns $1.25 per share ($25.25 sale price minus $24 purchase price). The members
of the selling group earn 75 cents for each share they sell ($26 sale price minus
$25.25 purchase price). Although some primary security offerings are directly
placed by the issuer, the majority of new issues are sold through public offering
via the mechanism just described.

CHAPTER 7
Stock Valuation
277
7.3 Common Stock Valuation
Common stockholders expect to be rewarded through periodic cash dividends
and an increasing share value. Some of these investors decide which stocks to buy
and sell based on a plan to maintain a broadly diversified portfolio. Other
investors have a more speculative motive for trading. They try to spot companies
whose shares are undervalued—meaning that the true value of the shares is
greater than the current market price. These investors buy shares that they believe
to be undervalued and sell shares that they think are overvalued (that is, the
market price is greater than the true value). Regardless of one’s motive for
trading, understanding how to value common stocks is an important part of the
investment process. Stock valuation is also an important tool for financial managers—
how can they work to maximize the stock price without understanding the factors
that determine the value of the stock? In this section, we will describe specific
stock valuation techniques. First, we will consider the relationship between
market efficiency and stock valuation.
MARKET EFFICIENCY
Economically rational buyers and sellers use their assessment of an asset’s risk
and return to determine its value. To a buyer, the asset’s value represents the max-
imum purchase price, and to a seller it represents the minimum sale price. In com-
petitive markets with many active participants, such as the New York Stock
Exchange, the interactions of many buyers and sellers result in an equilibrium
price—the market value—for each security. This price reflects the collective
actions that buyers and sellers take on the basis of all available information.
Buyers and sellers digest new information quickly as it becomes available and,
through their purchase and sale activities, create a new market equilibrium price.
Because the flow of new information is almost constant, stock prices fluctuate,
continuously moving toward a new equilibrium that reflects the most recent
information available. This general concept is known as market efficiency.
LG 5
LG 4

THE EFFICIENT-MARKET HYPOTHESIS
As noted in Chapter 2, active broker and dealer markets, such as the New York
Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq market, are efficient—they are made up of many
rational investors who react quickly and objectively to new information. The
efficient-market hypothesis (EMH), which is the basic theory describing the
behavior of such a “perfect” market, specifically states that
1. Securities are typically in equilibrium, which means that they are fairly priced
and that their expected returns equal their required returns.
2. At any point in time, security prices fully reflect all information available about
the firm and its securities, and these prices react swiftly to new information.
3. Because stocks are fully and fairly priced, investors need not waste their time
trying to find mispriced (undervalued or overvalued) securities.
Not all market participants are believers in the efficient-market hypothesis.
Some feel that it is worthwhile to search for undervalued or overvalued securities
and to trade them to profit from market inefficiencies. Others argue that it is
mere luck that would allow market participants to anticipate new information
correctly and as a result earn abnormal returns—that is, actual returns greater
than average market returns. They believe it is unlikely that market participants
can over the long run earn abnormal returns. Contrary to this belief, some well-
known investors such as Warren Buffett and Bill Gross have over the long run
consistently earned abnormal returns on their portfolios. It is unclear whether
their success is the result of their superior ability to anticipate new information or
of some form of market inefficiency.
The Behavioral Finance Challenge
Although considerable evidence supports the concept of market efficiency, a
growing body of academic evidence has begun to cast doubt on the validity of
this notion. The research documents various anomalies—outcomes that are incon-
sistent with efficient markets—in stock returns. A number of academics and prac-
titioners have also recognized that emotions and other subjective factors play a
role in investment decisions.
This focus on investor behavior has resulted in a significant body of research,
collectively referred to as behavioral finance. Advocates of behavioral finance are
commonly referred to as “behaviorists.” Daniel Kahneman was awarded the
2002 Nobel Prize in economics for his work in behavioral finance, specifically for
integrating insights from psychology and economics. Ongoing research into the
psychological factors that can affect investor behavior and the resulting effects on
stock prices will likely result in growing acceptance of behavioral finance. The
Focus on Practice box further explains some of the findings of behavioral
finance.
While challenges to the efficient market hypothesis, such as those presented by
advocates of behavioral finance, are interesting and worthy of study, in this text we
generally take the position that markets are efficient. This means that the terms
expected return and required return will be used interchangeably because they
should be equal in an efficient market. In other words, we will operate under the
assumption that a stock’s market price at any point in time is the best estimate of its
value. We’re now ready to look closely at the mechanics of common stock valuation.

BASIC COMMON STOCK VALUATION EQUATION
Like the value of a bond, which we discussed in Chapter 6, the value of a share of
common stock is equal to the present value of all future cash flows (dividends)
that it is expected to provide. Although a stockholder can earn capital gains by
selling stock at a price above that originally paid, what the buyer really pays for
is the right to all future dividends. What about stocks that do not currently pay
dividends? Such stocks have a value attributable to a future dividend stream or to
the proceeds from the sale of the company. Therefore, from a valuation view-
point, future dividends are relevant.

Understanding Human Behavior Helps Us Understand
Investor Behavior
Other investor behaviors are prospect
theory and anchoring. According to
prospect theory, people express a differ-
ent degree of emotion toward gains than
losses. Individuals are stressed more 
by prospective losses than they are
buoyed by the prospect of equal gains.
Anchoring is the tendency of investors to
place more value on recent information.
People tend to give too much credence
to recent market opinions and events and
mistakenly extrapolate recent trends that
differ from historical, long-term averages
and probabilities. Anchoring is a partial
explanation for the longevity of some bull
markets.
Most stock-valuation techniques
require that all relevant information 
be available to properly determine a
stock’s value and potential for future
gain. Behavioral finance may explain
the connection between valuation and
an investor’s actions based on that
valuation.
3 Theories of behavioral finance can
apply to other areas of human
behavior in addition to investing.
Think of a situation in which you
may have demonstrated one of
these behaviors. Share your 
situation with a classmate.
embarrassment about losing money on
a popular stock than about losing money
on an unknown or unpopular stock.
People have a tendency to place
particular events into mental accounts,
and the difference between these com-
partments sometimes influences behav-
ior more than the events themselves.
Researchers have asked people the fol-
lowing question: “Would you purchase
a $20 ticket at the local theater if you
realize after you get there that you
have lost a $20 bill?” Roughly 88 per-
cent of people would do so. Under
another scenario, people were asked
whether they would buy a second $20
ticket if they arrived at the theater and
realized that they had left at home a
ticket purchased in advance for $20.
Only 40 percent of respondents would
buy another. In both scenarios the per-
son is out $40, but mental accounting
leads to a different outcome. In invest-
ing, compartmentalization is best illus-
trated by the hesitation to sell an
investment that once had monstrous
gains and now has a modest gain.
During bull markets, people get accus-
tomed to paper gains. When a market
correction deflates investors’ net worth,
they are hesitant to sell, causing them
to wait for the return of that gain.
Market anomalies are
patterns inconsistent
with the efficient market hypothesis.
Behavioral finance has a number of
theories to help explain how human
emotions influence people in their
investment decision-making processes.
Regret theory deals with the emo-
tional reaction people experience after
realizing they have made an error in
judgment. When deciding whether to
sell a stock, investors become emotion-
ally affected by the price at which
they purchased the stock. A sale at a
loss would confirm that the investor 
miscalculated the value of the stock
when it was purchased. The correct
approach when considering whether to
sell a stock is, “Would I buy this stock
today if it were already liquidated?” If
the answer is “no,” it is time to sell.
Regret theory also holds true for
investors who passed up buying a
stock that now is selling at a much
higher price. Again, the correct
approach is to value the stock today
without regard to its prior value.
Herding is another market behavior
affecting investor decisions. Some
investors rationalize their decision to
buy certain stocks with “everyone else
is doing it.” Investors may feel less
in practice

The basic valuation model for common stock is given in Equation 7.1:
(7.1)
where
The equation can be simplified somewhat by redefining each year’s dividend, Dt,
in terms of anticipated growth. We will consider three models here: zero growth,
constant growth, and variable growth.
Zero-Growth Model
The simplest approach to dividend valuation, the zero-growth model, assumes a con-
stant, nongrowing dividend stream. In terms of the notation already introduced,
When we let D1 represent the amount of the annual dividend, Equation 7.1 under
zero growth reduces to
(7.2)
The equation shows that with zero growth, the value of a share of stock would equal
the present value of a perpetuity of D1 dollars discounted at a rate rs. (Perpetuities
were introduced in Chapter 5; see Equation 5.14 and the related discussion.)
Chuck Swimmer estimates that the dividend of Denham
Company, an established textile producer, is expected to remain
constant at $3 per share indefinitely. If his required return on its stock is 15%, the
stock’s value is 
per share.
Preferred Stock Valuation
Because preferred stock typically provides its
holders with a fixed annual dividend over its assumed infinite life, Equation 7.2
can be used to find the value of preferred stock. The value of preferred stock can
be estimated by substituting the stated dividend on the preferred stock for D1 and
the required return for rs in Equation 7.2. For example, a preferred stock paying
a $5 stated annual dividend and having a required return of 13 percent would
have a value of 
per share.
Constant-Growth Model
The most widely cited dividend valuation approach, the constant-growth model,
assumes that dividends will grow at a constant rate, but a rate that is less than the

the required return, rs, is a necessary mathematical condition for deriving this
model.1) By letting D0 represent the most recent dividend, we can rewrite
Equation 7.1 as follows:
(7.3)
If we simplify Equation 7.3, it can be rewritten as:
(7.4)
The constant-growth model in Equation 7.4 is commonly called the Gordon
growth model. An example will show how it works.

1. Another assumption of the constant-growth model as presented is that earnings and dividends grow at the same
rate. This assumption is true only in cases in which a firm pays out a fixed percentage of its earnings each year (has
a fixed payout ratio). In the case of a declining industry, a negative growth rate (g
0%) might exist. In such a case,
the constant-growth model, as well as the variable-growth model presented in the next section, remains fully appli-
cable to the valuation process.

that its dividend in 2013, D1, will equal $1.50 (about 7% more than the last div-
idend). The required return, rs, is 15%. By substituting these values into Equation
7.4, we find the value of the stock to be
Assuming that the values of D1, rs, and g are accurately estimated, Lamar Com-
pany’s stock value is $18.75 per share.
Variable-Growth Model
The zero- and constant-growth common stock models do not allow for any shift
in expected growth rates. Because future growth rates might shift up or down
because of changing business conditions, it is useful to consider a variable-growth
model that allows for a change in the dividend growth rate.3 We will assume that
a single shift in growth rates occurs at the end of year N, and we will use g1 to
represent the initial growth rate and g2 for the growth rate after the shift. To
determine the value of a share of stock in the case of variable growth, we use a
four-step procedure:
Step 1
Find the value of the cash dividends at the end of each year, Dt, during
the initial growth period, years 1 through N. This step may require
adjusting the most recent dividend, D0, using the initial growth rate, g1,
to calculate the dividend amount for each year. Therefore, for the first N
years,
Step 2
Find the present value of the dividends expected during the initial growth
period. Using the notation presented earlier, we can give this value as
Step 3
Find the value of the stock at the end of the initial growth period,
, which is the present value of all dividends expected
from year 
to infinity, assuming a constant dividend growth 
rate, g2. This value is found by applying the constant-growth model
(Equation 7.4) to the dividends expected from year 
to infinity.

2. A financial calculator can be used. (Note: Most calculators require either the PV or FV value to be input as a neg-
ative number to calculate an unknown interest or growth rate. That approach is used here.) Using the inputs shown
at the left, you should find the growth rate to be 6.96%, which we round to 7%.
An electronic spreadsheet could also be used to make this computation. Given space considerations, we have for-
gone that computational aid here.
3. More than one change in the growth rate can be incorporated into the model, but to simplify the discussion we
will consider only a single growth-rate change. The number of variable-growth valuation models is technically
unlimited, but concern over all possible shifts in growth is unlikely to yield much more accuracy than a simpler
model.

The following example illustrates the application of these steps to a variable-

Victoria Robb is considering purchasing the common stock of
Warren Industries, a rapidly growing boat manufacturer. She
finds that the firm’s most recent (2012) annual dividend payment was $1.50 per
share. Victoria estimates that these dividends will increase at a 10% annual rate,
g1, over the next 3 years (2013, 2014, and 2015) because of the introduction of a
hot new boat. At the end of the 3 years (the end of 2015), she expects the firm’s
mature product line to result in a slowing of the dividend growth rate to 5% per
year, g2, for the foreseeable future. Victoria’s required return, rs, is 15%. To esti-
mate the current (end-of-2012) value of Warren’s common stock,

per share.
FREE CASH FLOW VALUATION MODEL
As an alternative to the dividend valuation models presented earlier in this
chapter, a firm’s value can be estimated by using its projected free cash flows
(FCFs). This approach is appealing when one is valuing firms that have no divi-
dend history or are startups or when one is valuing an operating unit or division
of a larger public company. Although dividend valuation models are widely used
and accepted, in these situations it is preferable to use a more general free cash
flow valuation model.
The free cash flow valuation model is based on the same basic premise as div-
idend valuation models: The value of a share of common stock is the present
value of all future cash flows it is expected to provide over an infinite time
horizon. However, in the free cash flow valuation model, instead of valuing the
firm’s expected dividends, we value the firm’s expected free cash flows, defined in
Equation 4.4 (on page 122). They represent the amount of cash flow available to
investors—the providers of debt (creditors) and equity (owners)—after all other
obligations have been met.
The free cash flow valuation model estimates the value of the entire company
by finding the present value of its expected free cash flows discounted at its

Note the similarity between Equations 7.6 and 7.1, the general stock valuation
equation.
Because the value of the entire company, VC, is the market value of the entire
enterprise (that is, of all assets), to find common stock value, VS, we must sub-
tract the market value of all of the firm’s debt, VD, and the market value of pre-
ferred stock, VP, from VC:
(7.7)
Because it is difficult to forecast a firm’s free cash flow, specific annual cash
flows are typically forecast for only about 5 years, beyond which a constant
growth rate is assumed. Here we assume that the first 5 years of free cash flows
are explicitly forecast and that a constant rate of free cash flow growth occurs
beyond the end of year 5 to infinity. This model is methodologically similar to the
variable-growth model presented earlier. Its application is best demonstrated with
an example.
Dewhurst, Inc., wishes to determine the value of its stock by using the free cash
flow valuation model. To apply the model, the firm’s CFO developed the data
given in Table 7.4. Application of the model can be performed in four steps.
Step 1
Calculate the present value of the free cash flow occurring from the end
of 2018 to infinity, measured at the beginning of 2018 (that is, at the end
of 2017). Because a constant rate of growth in FCF is forecast beyond
2017, we can use the constant-growth dividend valuation model

VS = $8,626,426 - $3,100,000 - $800,000 = $4,726,426

It should now be clear that the free cash flow valuation model is consistent
with the dividend valuation models presented earlier. The appeal of this approach is
its focus on the free cash flow estimates rather than on forecasted dividends, which
are far more difficult to estimate given that they are paid at the discretion of the
firm’s board. The more general nature of the free cash flow model is responsible for
its growing popularity, particularly with CFOs and other financial managers.
OTHER APPROACHES TO COMMON STOCK VALUATION
Many other approaches to common stock valuation exist. The more popular
approaches include book value, liquidation value, and some type of price/
earnings multiple.
Book Value
Book value per share is simply the amount per share of common stock that would
be received if all of the firm’s assets were sold for their exact book (accounting)
value and the proceeds remaining after paying all liabilities (including preferred
stock) were divided among the common stockholders. This method lacks sophisti-
cation and can be criticized on the basis of its reliance on historical balance sheet
data. It ignores the firm’s expected earnings potential and generally lacks any true
relationship to the firm’s value in the marketplace. Let us look at an example.
At year-end 2012, Lamar Company’s balance sheet shows total assets of $6 million,
total liabilities (including preferred stock) of $4.5 million, and 100,000 shares of
common stock outstanding. Its book value per share therefore would be
Because this value assumes that assets could be sold for their book value, it may
not represent the minimum price at which shares are valued in the marketplace.
As a matter of fact, although most stocks sell above book value, it is not unusual
to find stocks selling below book value when investors believe either that assets
are overvalued or that the firm’s liabilities are understated.
Liquidation Value
Liquidation value per share is the actual amount per share of common stock that
would be received if all of the firm’s assets were sold for their market value, liabili-
ties (including preferred stock) were paid, and any remaining money were divided
among the common stockholders. This measure is more realistic than book value—
because it is based on the current market value of the firm’s assets—but it still fails
to consider the earning power of those assets. An example will illustrate.
Lamar Company found on investigation that it could obtain only $5.25 million if
it sold its assets today. The firm’s liquidation value per share therefore would be
Ignoring liquidation expenses, this amount would be the firm’s minimum value.
$5,250,000 - $4,500,000
100,000 shares
= $7.50 per share

Price/Earnings (P/E) Multiples
The price/earnings (P/E) ratio, introduced in Chapter 3, reflects the amount
investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings. The average P/E ratio in a
particular industry can be used as a guide to a firm’s value—if it is assumed that
investors value the earnings of that firm in the same way they do the “average”
firm in the industry. The price/earnings multiple approach is a popular technique
used to estimate the firm’s share value; it is calculated by multiplying the firm’s
expected earnings per share (EPS) by the average price/earnings (P/E) ratio for the
industry. The average P/E ratio for the industry can be obtained from a source
such as Standard & Poor’s Industrial Ratios.
The P/E ratio valuation technique is a simple method of determining a stock’s
value and can be quickly calculated after firms make earnings announcements,
which accounts for its popularity. Naturally, this has increased the demand for
more frequent announcements or “guidance” regarding future earnings. Some
firms feel that pre-earnings guidance creates additional costs and can lead to 
ethical issues, as discussed in the Focus on Ethics box below.

term, and now business groups are
coming to their defense. “The focus on
the short term is a huge problem,” says
William Donaldson, former chairman of
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
“With all of the attention paid to 
quarterly performance, managers are
taking their eyes off long-term strategic
goals.”
Donaldson, the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, and others believe that the
best way to focus companies toward
long-term goals is to do away with the
practice of giving quarterly earnings
guidance. In March 2007 the CFA
Centre for Financial Market Integrity
and the Business Roundtable Institute for
Corporate Ethics proposed a template
for quarterly earnings reports that
would, in their view, obviate the need
for earnings guidance.
Meanwhile, many companies are
hesitant to give up issuing quarterly
guidance. The practice of issuing 
earnings forecasts began in the early
1980s, a few years after the SEC’s
decision to allow companies to include
forward-looking projections, provided
they were accompanied by appropri-
ate cautionary language. The result
was what former SEC chairman Arthur
Levitt once called a “game of winks
and nods.” Companies used earnings
guidance to lower analysts’ estimates;
when the actual numbers came in
higher, their stock prices jumped. The
practice reached a fever pitch during
the late 1990s when companies that
missed the consensus earnings esti-
mate, even by just a penny, saw their
stock prices tumble.
One of the first companies to stop
issuing earnings guidance was Gillette,
in 2001. Others that abandoned quar-
terly guidance were Coca-Cola, Intel,
and McDonald’s. It became a trend. By
2005, just 61 percent of companies
were offering quarterly projections to
the public; according to the National
Investor Relations Institute, the number
declined to 52 percent in 2006.
Not everyone agrees with eliminat-
ing quarterly guidance. A survey con-
ducted by New York University’s Stern
School of Business finance professor
Baruch Lev, along with University of
Florida professors Joel Houston and
Jennifer Tucker, showed that companies
that ended quarterly guidance reaped
almost no benefit from doing so. Their
study found no evidence that guidance
stoppers increased capital investments
or research and development. So when
should companies give up earnings
guidance? According to Lev, they
should do so only when they are not
very good at predicting their earnings.
“If you are not better than others at fore-
casting, then don’t bother,” he says.
3 What temptations might managers
face if they have provided earnings
guidance to investors and later find it
difficult to meet the expectations that
they helped create?
in practice

The use of P/E multiples is especially helpful in valuing firms that are not
publicly traded, but analysts use this approach for public companies too. In any
case, the price/earnings multiple approach is considered superior to the use of
book or liquidation values because it considers expected earnings. An example
will demonstrate the use of price/earnings multiples.
Ann Perrier plans to use the price/earnings multiple approach
to estimate the value of Lamar Company’s stock, which she
currently holds in her retirement account. She estimates that Lamar Company
will earn $2.60 per share next year (2013). This expectation is based on an
analysis of the firm’s historical earnings trend and of expected economic and
industry conditions. She finds the price/earnings (P/E) ratio for firms in the same
industry to average 7. Multiplying Lamar’s expected earnings per share (EPS) of
$2.60 by this ratio gives her a value for the firm’s shares of $18.20, assuming that
investors will continue to value the average firm at 7 times its earnings.
So how much is Lamar Company’s stock really worth? That’s a trick ques-
tion because there’s no one right answer. It is important to recognize that the
answer depends on the assumptions made and the techniques used. Professional
securities analysts typically use a variety of models and techniques to value
stocks. For example, an analyst might use the constant-growth model, liquidation
value, and a price/earnings (P/E) multiple to estimate the worth of a given stock.
If the analyst feels comfortable with his or her estimates, the stock would be
valued at no more than the largest estimate. Of course, should the firm’s esti-
mated liquidation value per share exceed its “going concern” value per share,
estimated by using one of the valuation models (zero-, constant-, or variable-
growth or free cash flow) or the P/E multiple approach, the firm would be viewed
as being “worth more dead than alive.” In such an event, the firm would lack suf-
ficient earning power to justify its existence and should probably be liquidated.

Matter of fact
T
he P/E multiple approach is a fast and easy way to estimate a stock’s value. However, P/E
ratios vary widely over time. In 1980, the average stock had a P/E ratio below 9, but by the
year 2000, the ratio had risen above 40. Therefore, analysts using the P/E approach in the
1980s would have come up with much lower estimates of value than analysts using the model 
20 years later. In other words, when using this approach to estimate stock values, the estimate will
depend more on whether stock market valuations generally are high or low rather than on
whether the particular company is doing well or not.

7.4 Decision Making and Common Stock Value
Valuation equations measure the stock value at a point in time based on expected
return and risk. Any decisions of the financial manager that affect these variables
can cause the value of the firm to change. Figure 7.3 depicts the relationship
among financial decisions, return, risk, and stock value.
CHANGES IN EXPECTED DIVIDENDS
Assuming that economic conditions remain stable, any management action that
would cause current and prospective stockholders to raise their dividend expecta-
tions should increase the firm’s value. In Equation 7.4, we can see that P0 will
increase for any increase in D1 or g. Any action of the financial manager that will
increase the level of expected dividends without changing risk (the required
return) should be undertaken, because it will positively affect owners’ wealth.
Using the constant-growth model in an earlier example (on pages 281 and 282),
we found Lamar Company to have a share value of $18.75. On the following
day, the firm announced a major technological breakthrough that would revolu-
tionize its industry. Current and prospective stockholders would not be expected
to adjust their required return of 15%, but they would expect that future divi-
dends will increase. Specifically, they expect that although the dividend next year,
D1, will remain at $1.50, the expected rate of growth thereafter will increase
from 7% to 9%. If we substitute 
and 
into
Equation 7.4, the resulting share value is 
. The
increased value therefore resulted from the higher expected future dividends
reflected in the increase in the growth rate.

CHANGES IN RISK
Although the required return, rs, is the focus of Chapters 8 and 9, at this point we
can consider its fundamental components. Any measure of required return con-
sists of two components, a risk-free rate and a risk premium. We expressed this
relationship as Equation 6.1 in the previous chapter, which we repeat here in
terms of rs:
risk-free
risk
rate, RF
premium
In the next chapter you will learn that the real challenge in finding the required
return is determining the appropriate risk premium. In Chapters 8 and 9 we will
discuss how investors and managers can estimate the risk premium for any par-
ticular asset. For now, recognize that rs represents the minimum return that the
firm’s stock must provide to shareholders to compensate them for bearing the
risk of holding the firm’s equity.
Any action taken by the financial manager that increases the risk share-
holders must bear will also increase the risk premium required by shareholders,
and hence the required return. Additionally, the required return can be affected
by changes in the risk free rate—even if the risk premium remains constant. For
example, if the risk-free rate increases due to a shift in government policy, then
the required return goes up too. In Equation 7.1, we can see that an increase in
the required return, rs, will reduce share value, P0, and a decrease in the required
return will increase share value. Thus, any action of the financial manager that
increases risk contributes to a reduction in value, and any action that decreases
risk contributes to an increase in value.
Assume that Lamar Company’s 15% required return resulted from a risk-free
rate of 9% and a risk premium of 6%. With this return, the firm’s share value
was calculated in an earlier example (on pages 280 and 281) to be $18.75.
Now imagine that the financial manager makes a decision that, without
changing expected dividends, causes the firm’s risk premium to increase to 7%.
Assuming that the risk-free rate remains at 9%, the new required return on
Lamar stock will be 16% (9%
7%), substituting 
and
into the valuation equation (Equation 7.3), results in a new share value
of 
. As expected, raising the required return,
without any corresponding increase in expected dividends, causes the firm’s stock
value to decline. Clearly, the financial manager’s action was not in the owners’
best interest.
COMBINED EFFECT
A financial decision rarely affects dividends and risk independently; most deci-
sions affect both factors often in the same direction. As firms take on more risk,
their shareholders expect to see higher dividends. The net effect on value depends
on the relative size of the changes in these two variables.

PART 3
Valuation of Securities
Summary
FOCUS ON VALUE
The price of each share of a firm’s common stock is the value of each ownership
interest. Although common stockholders typically have voting rights, which
indirectly give them a say in management, their most significant right is their
claim on the residual cash flows of the firm. This claim is subordinate to those
of vendors, employees, customers, lenders, the government (for taxes), and pre-
ferred stockholders. The value of the common stockholders’ claim is embodied
in the future cash flows they are entitled to receive. The present value of those
expected cash flows is the firm’s share value.
To determine this present value, forecast cash flows are discounted at a rate
that reflects their risk. Riskier cash flows are discounted at higher rates, resulting
in lower present values than less risky expected cash flows, which are discounted
at lower rates. The value of the firm’s common stock is therefore driven by its
expected cash flows (returns) and risk (certainty of the expected cash flows).
In pursuing the firm’s goal of maximizing the stock price, the financial man-
ager must carefully consider the balance of return and risk associated with each
proposal and must undertake only those actions that create value for owners. 
By focusing on value creation and by managing and monitoring the firm’s cash
flows and risk, the financial manager should be able to achieve the firm’s goal of
share price maximization.
REVIEW OF LEARNING GOALS
Differentiate between debt and equity. Holders of equity capital
(common and preferred stock) are owners of the firm. Typically, only common
stockholders have a voice in management. Equityholders’ claims on income and
LG 1

assets are secondary to creditors’ claims, there is no maturity date, and divi-
dends paid to stockholders are not tax deductible.
Discuss the features of both common and preferred stock. The common
stock of a firm can be privately owned, closely owned, or publicly owned. It can
be sold with or without a par value. Preemptive rights allow common stock-
holders to avoid dilution of ownership when new shares are issued. Not all
shares authorized in the corporate charter are outstanding. If a firm has treasury
stock, it will have issued more shares than are outstanding. Some firms have two
or more classes of common stock that differ mainly in having unequal voting
rights. Proxies transfer voting rights from one party to another. The decision to
pay dividends to common stockholders is made by the firm’s board of directors.
Firms can issue stock in foreign markets. The stock of many foreign corpora-
tions is traded in U.S. markets in the form of American depositary receipts
(ADRs), which are backed by American depositary shares (ADSs).
Preferred stockholders have preference over common stockholders with
respect to the distribution of earnings and assets. They do not normally have
voting privileges. Preferred stock issues may have certain restrictive covenants,
cumulative dividends, a call feature, and a conversion feature.
Describe the process of issuing common stock, including venture capital,
going public, and the investment banker. The initial nonfounder financing for
business startups with attractive growth prospects typically comes from private
equity investors. These investors can be either angel capitalists or venture capi-
talists (VCs). VCs usually invest in both early-stage and later-stage companies
that they hope to take public so as to cash out their investments.
The first public issue of a firm’s stock is called an initial public offering
(IPO). The company selects an investment banker to advise it and to sell the
securities. The lead investment banker may form a selling syndicate with other
investment bankers. The IPO process includes getting SEC approval, promoting
the offering to investors, and pricing the issue.
Understand the concept of market efficiency and basic stock valuation
using zero-growth, constant-growth, and variable-growth models. Market effi-
ciency assumes that the quick reactions of rational investors to new informa-
tion cause the market value of common stock to adjust upward or downward
quickly. The efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) suggests that securities are 
fairly priced, that they reflect fully all publicly available information, and that
investors should therefore not waste time trying to find and capitalize on mis-
priced securities. Behavioral finance advocates challenge this hypothesis by
arguing that emotion and other factors play a role in investment decisions.
The value of a share of stock is the present value of all future dividends it 
is expected to provide over an infinite time horizon. Three dividend growth
models—zero-growth, constant-growth, and variable-growth—can be consid-
ered in common stock valuation. The most widely cited model is the constant-
growth model.
Discuss the free cash flow valuation model and the book value, liquida-
tion value, and price/earnings (P/E) multiple approaches. The free cash flow 
valuation model values firms that have no dividend history, startups, or an 
operating unit or division of a larger public company. The model finds the value

of the entire company by discounting the firm’s expected free cash flow at its
weighted average cost of capital. The common stock value is found by sub-
tracting the market values of the firm’s debt and preferred stock from the value
of the entire company.
Book value per share is the amount per share of common stock that would
be received if all of the firm’s assets were sold for their exact book (accounting)
value and the proceeds remaining after paying all liabilities (including preferred
stock) were divided among the common stockholders. Liquidation value per
share is the actual amount per share of common stock that would be received 
if all of the firm’s assets were sold for their market value, liabilities (including
preferred stock) were paid, and the remaining money were divided among the
common stockholders. The price/earnings (P/E) multiple approach estimates
stock value by multiplying the firm’s expected earnings per share (EPS) by the
average price/earnings (P/E) ratio for the industry.
Explain the relationships among financial decisions, return, risk, and 
the firm’s value. In a stable economy, any action of the financial manager that
increases the level of expected dividends without changing risk should increase
share value; any action that reduces the level of expected dividends without
changing risk should reduce share value. Similarly, any action that increases 
risk (required return) will reduce share value; any action that reduces risk will
increase share value. An assessment of the combined effect of return and risk 
on stock value must be part of the financial decision-making process.

earned $4.25 per share and paid cash dividends of $2.55 per share 
.
Grips’ earnings and dividends are expected to grow at 25% per year for the 
next 3 years, after which they are expected to grow at 10% per year to infinity.
What is the maximum price per share that Newman should pay for Grips if it 
has a required return of 15% on investments with risk characteristics similar to
those of Grips?

pany paid a dividend of $3.40. It expects zero growth in the next year. In years 2
and 3, 5% growth is expected, and in year 4, 15% growth. In year 5 and thereafter,
growth should be a constant 10% per year. What is the maximum price per share

Nabor Industries is considering going public but is unsure
of a fair offering price for the company. Before hiring an investment banker to assist
in making the public offering, managers at Nabor have decided to make their own
estimate of the firm’s common stock value. The firm’s CFO has gathered data for
performing the valuation using the free cash flow valuation model.
The firm’s weighted average cost of capital is 11%, and it has $1,500,000 of
debt at market value and $400,000 of preferred stock at its assumed market value.
The estimated free cash flows over the next 5 years, 2013 through 2017, are given

Encore International
I
n the world of trendsetting fashion, instinct and marketing savvy are prerequisites
to success. Jordan Ellis had both. During 2012, his international casual-wear com-
pany, Encore, rocketed to $300 million in sales after 10 years in business. His
fashion line covered the young woman from head to toe with hats, sweaters, dresses,
blouses, skirts, pants, sweatshirts, socks, and shoes. In Manhattan, there was an
Encore shop every five or six blocks, each featuring a different color. Some shops
showed the entire line in mauve, and others featured it in canary yellow.
Encore had made it. The company’s historical growth was so spectacular that
no one could have predicted it. However, securities analysts speculated that Encore
could not keep up the pace. They warned that competition is fierce in the fashion
industry and that the firm might encounter little or no growth in the future. They
estimated that stockholders also should expect no growth in future dividends.
Contrary to the conservative securities analysts, Jordan Ellis felt that the com-
pany could maintain a constant annual growth rate in dividends per share of 6% in
the future, or possibly 8% for the next 2 years and 6% thereafter. Ellis based his
estimates on an established long-term expansion plan into European and Latin
American markets. Venturing into these markets was expected to cause the risk of
the firm, as measured by the risk premium on its stock, to increase immediately from
8.8% to 10%. Currently, the risk-free rate is 6%.
In preparing the long-term financial plan, Encore’s chief financial officer has
assigned a junior financial analyst, Marc Scott, to evaluate the firm’s current stock
price. He has asked Marc to consider the conservative predictions of the securities
analysts and the aggressive predictions of the company founder, Jordan Ellis.
Marc has compiled these 2012 financial data to aid his analysis:

ost people intuitively understand the principle that risk and return are linked.
After all, as the old saying goes, “Nothing ventured, nothing gained.” In the
next two chapters, we’ll explore how investors and financial managers quantify the
notion of risk and how they determine how much additional return is appropriate
compensation for taking extra risk.
Chapter 8 lays the groundwork, defining the terms risk and return and explaining 
why investors think about risk in different ways depending on whether they want 
to understand the risk of a specific investment or the risk of a broad portfolio of
investments. Perhaps the most famous and widely applied theory in all of finance, the
Capital Asset Pricing Model (or CAPM), is introduced here. The CAPM tells investors
and managers alike what return they should expect given the risk of the asset they want
to invest in.
Chapter 9 applies these lessons in a managerial finance setting. Firms raise money
from two broad sources, owners and lenders. Owners provide equity financing, and
lenders provide debt. To maximize the value of the firm, managers have to satisfy both
groups, and doing so means earning returns high enough to meet investors’
expectations. Chapter 9’s focus is on the cost of capital or, more precisely, the
weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The WACC tells managers exactly what
kind of return their investments in plant and equipment, advertising, and human
resources have to earn if the firm is to satisfy its investors. Essentially, the WACC is a
hurdle rate, the minimum acceptable return that a firm should earn on any investment
that it makes.

Why This Chapter Matters to You
In your professional life
ACCOUNTING You need to understand the relationship between risk
and return because of the effect that riskier projects will have on the
firm’s financial statements.
INFORMATION SYSTEMS You need to understand how to do scenario
and correlation analyses to build decision packages that help manage-
ment analyze the risk and return of various business opportunities.
MANAGEMENT You need to understand the relationship between risk
and return and how to measure that relationship to evaluate data that
come from finance personnel and translate those data into decisions
that increase the value of the firm.
MARKETING You need to understand that although higher-risk projects
may produce higher returns, they may not be the best choice for the
firm if they produce erratic financial results and fail to maximize firm
value.
OPERATIONS You need to understand why investments in plant, equip-
ment, and systems need to be evaluated in light of their impact on the
firm’s risk and return, which together will affect the firm’s value.
The tradeoff between risk and return
enters into numerous personal finan-
cial decisions. You will use risk and return concepts when you invest
your savings, buy real estate, finance major purchases, purchase insur-
ance, invest in securities, and implement retirement plans. Although risk
and return are difficult to measure precisely, you can get a feel for them
and make decisions based on the trade-offs between risk and return in
light of your personal disposition toward risk.

Fund’s Returns Not Even Close 
to Average
F
or most investors, 2008 was a miser-
able year. In the United States the
Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index, a
barometer of the overall market, fell 37.2
percent. Returns were even worse in many
other countries. The Morgan Stanley
Europe, Australasia, and Far East (EAFE) Index dropped 45 percent, wiping out the previous five
years worth of gains. For Deryck Noble-Nesbitt, manager of the Close Special Situations Fund
in the United Kingdom, 2008 was close to a career-ending catastrophe. The Close Fund, which
invests in small companies, lost nearly 60 percent of its value that year and ranked in the bottom
2 percent of all funds in its category. That performance followed a loss of nearly 5 percent in
2007, so the Close Fund was on a two-year losing streak going into 2009.
What a difference a year makes. In 2009, the Close Fund earned a return of 247 per-
cent and ranked first among all funds specializing in small stocks. An investor who put £1,000
in the fund at the beginning of 2007 would have had roughly £1,411 by December 31,
2009, far ahead of what investors in most other funds would have earned over the same
period. However, the first five months of 2010 were unkind to the Close Fund as it experienced
another 5 percent loss, once again falling in the bottom 3 percent of all funds in the small stock
category.
The experience of the Close Special Situations Fund illustrates two key points. First, invest-
ments with high returns tend to be associated with high risk. Small stocks as a category, and the
recent performance of the Close Fund, clearly demonstrate that principle. In fact, investors ought
to be suspicious of investment opportunities that appear to offer high returns without also having
high risk. (See the Focus on Ethics box on page 310.) Second, predicting how any particular
fund or investment will perform in any given period is difficult. In three consecutive years, the
Close Fund ranked near the bottom, at the very top, and then near the bottom again of its peer
group. Together, these two points suggest that investors must be very mindful of risk and should
diversify their investments. This chapter explains how to put that advice into action.

PART 4
Risk and the Required Rate of Return
8.1 Risk and Return Fundamentals
In most important business decisions there are two key financial considerations: risk
and return. Each financial decision presents certain risk and return characteristics,
and the combination of these characteristics can increase or decrease a firm’s share
price. Analysts use different methods to quantify risk, depending on whether they
are looking at a single asset or a portfolio—a collection, or group, of assets. We will
look at both, beginning with the risk of a single asset. First, though, it is important
to introduce some fundamental ideas about risk, return, and risk preferences.
RISK DEFINED
In the most basic sense, risk is a measure of the uncertainty surrounding the
return that an investment will earn. Investments whose returns are more uncer-
tain are generally viewed as being riskier. More formally, the term risk is used
interchangeably with uncertainty to refer to the variability of returns associated
with a given asset. A $1,000 government bond that guarantees its holder $5
interest after 30 days has no risk, because there is no variability associated with
the return. A $1,000 investment in a firm’s common stock, the value of which
over the same 30 days may move up or down a great deal, is very risky because of
the high variability of its return.

If It Seems Too Good to Be True Then It Probably Is
For many years,
investors around the
world clamored to invest with Bernard
Madoff. Those fortunate enough to
invest with “Bernie” might not have
understood his secret trading system,
but they were happy with the double-
digit returns that they earned. Madoff
was well connected, having been the
chairman of the board of directors of
the NASDAQ Stock Market and a
founding member of the International
Securities Clearing Corporation. His
credentials seemed to be impeccable.
However, as the old saying goes, if
something sounds too good to be true,
it probably is. Madoff’s investors
learned this lesson the hard way when,
on December 11, 2008, the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) charged Madoff with securities
fraud. Madoff’s hedge fund, Ascot
Partners, turned out to be a giant Ponzi
scheme.
Over the years, suspicions were
raised about Madoff. Madoff gener-
ated high returns year after year, seem-
ingly with very little risk. Madoff
credited his complex trading strategy
for his investment performance, but
other investors employed similar strate-
gies with much different results than
Madoff reported. Harry Markopolos
went as far as to submit a report to the
SEC three years prior to Madoff’s arrest
titled “The World’s Largest Hedge Fund
Is a Fraud” that detailed his concerns.a
On June 29, 2009, Madoff was
sentenced to 150 years in prison.
Madoff’s investors are still working to
recover what they can. Fraudulent
account statements sent just prior to
Madoff’s arrest indicated that investors’
accounts contained over $64 billion, in
aggregate. Many investors pursued
claims based on the balance reported
in these statements. However, a recent
court ruling permits claims up to the dif-
ference between the amount an investor
deposited with Madoff and the amount
they withdrew. The judge also ruled
that investors who managed to with-
draw at least their initial investment
before the fraud was uncovered are not
eligible to recover additional funds.
Total out-of-pocket cash losses as a
result of Madoff’s fraud were recently
estimated at slightly over $20 billion.

allowing investors to pursue 
claims based on their most recent

RETURN DEFINED
Obviously, if we are going to assess risk on the basis of variability of return, we
need to be certain we know what return is and how to measure it. The total rate
of return is the total gain or loss experienced on an investment over a given
period. Mathematically, an investment’s total return is the sum of any cash distri-
butions (for example, dividends or interest payments) plus the change in the
investment’s value, divided by the beginning-of-period value. The expression for
calculating the total rate of return earned on any asset over period t, rt, is com-
monly defined as
(8.1)
where
The return, rt, reflects the combined effect of cash flow, Ct, and changes in value,
, over the period.1
Equation 8.1 is used to determine the rate of return over a time period as
short as 1 day or as long as 10 years or more. However, in most cases, t is 1 year,
and r therefore represents an annual rate of return.
Robin wishes to determine the return on two stocks that she owned during 2009,
Apple Inc. and Wal-Mart. At the beginning of the year, Apple stock traded for
$90.75 per share, and Wal-Mart was valued at $55.33. During the year, Apple
paid no dividends, but Wal-Mart shareholders received dividends of $1.09 per
share. At the end of the year, Apple stock was worth $210.73 and Wal-Mart sold
for $52.84. Substituting into Equation 8.1, we can calculate the annual rate of
return, r, for each stock.
Robin made money on Apple and lost money on Wal-Mart in 2009, but notice
that her losses on Wal-Mart would have been greater had it not been for the div-
idends that she received on her Wal-Mart shares. When calculating the total rate
of return, it is important to take into account the effects of both cash disburse-
ments and changes in the price of the investment during the year.
Wal-Mart: ($1.09 + $52.84 - $55.33) , $55.33 = -2.5%
Apple: ($0 + $210.73 - $90.75) , $90.75 = 132.2%

1. This expression does not imply that an investor necessarily buys the asset at time 
and sells it at time t.
Rather, it represents the increase (or decrease) in wealth that the investor has experienced during the period by
holding a particular investment. If the investor sells the asset at time t, we say that the investor has realized the
return on the investment. If the investor continues to hold the investment, we say that the return is unrealized.
t - 1
total rate of return
The total gain or loss
experienced on an investment
over a given period of time;
calculated by dividing the
asset’s cash distributions during
the period, plus change in
value, by its beginning-of-
period investment value.

Investment returns vary both over time and between different types of invest-
ments. By averaging historical returns over a long period of time, we can focus on
the differences in returns that different kinds of investments tend to generate.
Table 8.1 shows both the nominal and real average annual rates of return from
1900 to 2009 for three different types of investments: Treasury bills, Treasury
bonds, and common stocks. Although bills and bonds are both issued by the U.S.
government and are therefore viewed as relatively safe investments, bills have
maturities of 1 year or less, while bonds have maturities ranging up to 30 years.
Consequently, the interest rate risk associated with Treasury bonds is much
higher than with bills. Over the last 109 years, bills earned the lowest returns, just
3.9 percent per year on average in nominal returns and only 0.9 percent annually
in real terms. The latter number means that average Treasury bill returns barely
exceeded the average rate of inflation. Bond returns were higher, 5.0 percent in
nominal terms and 1.9 percent in real terms. Clearly, though, stocks outshined
the other types of investments, earning average annual nominal returns of 
9.3 percent and average real returns of 6.2 percent.
In light of these statistics, you might wonder, “Why would anyone invest in
bonds or bills if the returns on stocks are so much higher?” The answer, as you will
soon see, is that stocks are much riskier than either bonds or bills and that risk leads
some investors to prefer the safer, albeit lower, returns on Treasury securities.
RISK PREFERENCES
Different people react to risk in different ways. Economists use three categories to
describe how investors respond to risk. The first category, and the one that
describes the behavior of most people most of the time, is called risk aversion. A
person who is a risk-averse investor prefers less risky over more risky invest-
ments, holding the rate of return fixed. A risk-averse investor who believes that
two different investments have the same expected return will choose the invest-
ment whose returns are more certain. Stated another way, when choosing
between two investments, a risk-averse investor will not make the riskier invest-
ment unless it offers a higher expected return to compensate the investor for
bearing the additional risk.
A second attitude toward risk is called risk neutrality. An investor who is risk
neutral chooses investments based solely on their expected returns, disregarding
the risks. When choosing between two investments, a risk-neutral investor will
always choose the investment with the higher expected return regardless of its
risk.

The attitude toward risk in

return regardless of its risk.

Finally, a risk-seeking investor is one who prefers investments with higher
risk and may even sacrifice some expected return when choosing a riskier invest-
ment. By design, the average person who buys a lottery ticket or gambles in a
casino loses money. After all, state governments and casinos make money off of
these endeavors, so individuals lose on average. This implies that the expected
return on these activities is negative. Yet people do buy lottery tickets and visit
casinos, and in doing so they exhibit risk-seeking behavior.

8.2 Risk of a Single Asset
In this section we refine our understanding of risk. Surprisingly, the concept of
risk changes when the focus shifts from the risk of a single asset held in isolation
to the risk of a portfolio of assets. Here, we examine different statistical methods
to quantify risk, and next we apply those methods to portfolios.
RISK ASSESSMENT
The notion that risk is somehow connected to uncertainty is intuitive. The more
uncertain you are about how an investment will perform, the riskier that invest-
ment seems. Scenario analysis provides a simple way to quantify that intuition,
and probability distributions offer an even more sophisticated way to analyze the
risk of an investment.
Scenario Analysis
Scenario analysis uses several possible alternative outcomes (scenarios) to obtain
a sense of the variability of returns.2 One common method involves considering
pessimistic (worst), most likely (expected), and optimistic (best) outcomes and
the returns associated with them for a given asset. In this one measure of an
investment’s risk is the range of possible outcomes. The range is found by sub-
tracting the return associated with the pessimistic outcome from the return asso-
ciated with the optimistic outcome. The greater the range, the more variability, or
risk, the asset is said to have.
Norman Company, a manufacturer of custom golf equipment, wants to choose the
better of two investments, A and B. Each requires an initial outlay of $10,000, and
each has a most likely annual rate of return of 15%. Management has estimated

plify this discussion. A more technical and precise definition and discussion of this technique and of sensitivity
analysis are presented in Chapter 12.

returns associated with each investment’s pessimistic and optimistic outcomes. The
three estimates for each asset, along with its range, are given in Table 8.2. Asset A
appears to be less risky than asset B; its range of 4% (17% minus 13%) is less than
the range of 16% (23% minus 7%) for asset B. The risk-averse decision maker
would prefer asset A over asset B, because A offers the same most likely return as B
(15%) with lower risk (smaller range).
It’s not unusual for financial managers to think about the best and worst pos-
sible outcomes when they are in the early stages of analyzing a new investment
project. No matter how great the intuitive appeal of this approach, looking at the
range of outcomes that an investment might produce is a very unsophisticated
way of measuring its risk. More sophisticated methods require some basic statis-
tical tools.
Probability Distributions
Probability distributions provide a more quantitative insight into an asset’s risk.
The probability of a given outcome is its chance of occurring. An outcome with
an 80 percent probability of occurrence would be expected to occur 8 out of 10
times. An outcome with a probability of 100 percent is certain to occur.
Outcomes with a probability of zero will never occur.

s it ever possible to know for sure that a particular outcome can never happen, that the chance
of it occurring is 0 percent? In the 2007 best seller, The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly
Improbable, Nassim Nicholas Taleb argues that seemingly improbable or even impossible events
are more likely to occur than most people believe, especially in the area of finance. The book’s
title refers to the fact that for many years, people believed that all swans were white until a 
black variety was discovered in Australia. Taleb reportedly earned a large fortune during the
2007–2008 financial crisis by betting that financial markets would plummet.
Beware of the Black Swan
Norman Company’s past estimates indicate that the probabilities of the pes-
simistic, most likely, and optimistic outcomes are 25%, 50%, and 25%, respec-
tively. Note that the sum of these probabilities must equal 100%; that is, they
must be based on all the alternatives considered.
Example 8.3 3

A probability distribution is a model that relates probabilities to the associated
outcomes. The simplest type of probability distribution is the bar chart. The bar
charts for Norman Company’s assets A and B are shown in Figure 8.1. Although
both assets have the same average return, the range of return is much greater, or
more dispersed, for asset B than for asset A—16 percent versus 4 percent.
Most investments have more than two or three possible outcomes. In fact,
the number of possible outcomes in most cases is practically infinite. If we knew
all the possible outcomes and associated probabilities, we could develop a
continuous probability distribution. This type of distribution can be thought of
as a bar chart for a very large number of outcomes. Figure 8.2 presents continuous
probability distributions for assets C and D. Note that although the two assets
have the same average return (15 percent), the distribution of returns for asset D
has much greater dispersion than the distribution for asset C. Apparently, asset D is
more risky than asset C.
RISK MEASUREMENT
In addition to considering the range of returns that an investment might produce,
the risk of an asset can be measured quantitatively by using statistics. The most
common statistical measure used to describe an investment’s risk is its standard
deviation.

Standard Deviation
The standard deviation,
r, measures the dispersion of an investment’s return
around the expected return. The expected return, , is the average return that an
investment is expected to produce over time. For an investment that has j dif-
ferent possible returns, the expected return is calculated as follows:3

The expected values of returns for Norman Company’s assets A and B are pre-
sented in Table 8.3. Column 1 gives the Prj’s and column 2 gives the rj’s. In each
case n equals 3. The expected value for each asset’s return is 15%.

Historical Returns and Risk
We can now use the standard deviation as a
measure of risk to assess the historical (1900–2009) investment return data in
Table 8.1. Table 8.5 repeats the historical nominal average returns in column 1
and shows the standard deviations associated with each of them in column 2. A
close relationship can be seen between the investment returns and the standard
deviations: Investments with higher returns have higher standard deviations. For
example, stocks have the highest average return at 9.3 percent, which is more
than double the average return on Treasury bills. At the same time, stocks are
much more volatile, with a standard deviation of 20.4 percent, more than four
times greater than the standard deviation of Treasury bills. Because higher stan-
dard deviations are associated with greater risk, the historical data confirm the
existence of a positive relationship between risk and return. That relationship
reflects risk aversion by market participants, who require higher returns as com-
pensation for greater risk. The historical data in columns 1 and 2 of Table 8.5
clearly show that during the 1900–2009 period, investors were, on average,
rewarded with higher returns on higher-risk investments.

PART 4
Risk and the Required Rate of Return
Matter of fact
T
able 8.5 shows that stocks are riskier than bonds, but are some stocks riskier than others? The
answer is emphatically yes. A recent study examined the historical returns of large stocks and
small stocks and found that the average annual return on large stocks from 1926 through 2009
was 11.8 percent, while small stocks earned 16.7 percent per year on average. The higher returns
on small stocks came with a cost, however. The standard deviation of small stock returns was a
whopping 32.8 percent, whereas the standard deviation on large stocks was just 20.5 percent.

Normal Distribution
A normal probability distribution, depicted in Figure 8.3,
resembles a symmetrical “bell-shaped” curve. The symmetry of the curve means
that half the probability is associated with the values to the left of the peak and
half with the values to the right. As noted on the figure, for normal probability
distributions, 68 percent of the possible outcomes will lie between 1 standard
deviation from the expected value, 95 percent of all outcomes will lie between 2
standard deviations from the expected value, and 99 percent of all outcomes will
lie between 3 standard deviations from the expected value.

Using the data in Table 8.5 and assuming that the probability distributions of
returns for common stocks and bonds are normal, we can surmise that 68% of the
possible outcomes would have a return ranging between 
11.1% and 29.7% for
stocks and between 5.2% and 15.2% for bonds; 95% of the possible return out-
comes would range between 31.5% and 50.1% for stocks and between 15.4%
and 25.4% for bonds. The greater risk of stocks is clearly reflected in their much
wider range of possible returns for each level of confidence (68% or 95%).
Coefficient of Variation—Trading Off Risk and Return
The coefficient of variation, CV, is a measure of relative dispersion that is useful
in comparing the risks of assets with differing expected returns. Equation 8.4
gives the expression for the coefficient of variation:
(8.4)
A higher coefficient of variation means that an investment has more volatility rel-
ative to its expected return. Because investors prefer higher returns and less risk,
intuitively one might expect investors to gravitate towards investments with a
low coefficient of variation. However, this logic doesn’t always apply for reasons
that will emerge in the next section. For now, consider the coefficients of varia-
tion in column 3 of Table 8.5. That table reveals that Treasury bills have the
lowest coefficient of variation and therefore the lowest risk relative to their
return. Does this mean that investors should load up on Treasury bills and divest
themselves of stocks? Not necessarily.
When the standard deviations (from Table 8.4) and the expected returns (from
Table 8.3) for assets A and B are substituted into Equation 8.4, the coefficients of
variation for A and B are 0.094 (1.41%
15%) and 0.377 (5.66%
15%),
respectively. Asset B has the higher coefficient of variation and is therefore more
risky than asset A—which we already know from the standard deviation.
(Because both assets have the same expected return, the coefficient of variation
has not provided any new information.)

Marilyn Ansbro is reviewing stocks for inclusion in her invest-

Industries, Inc. (DII), a diversified manufacturer of pet products. One of her key
concerns is risk; as a rule she will invest only in stocks with a coefficient of varia-
tion below 0.75. She has gathered price and dividend data (shown in the accom-
panying table) for DII over the past 3 years, 2010–2012, and assumes that each

8.3 Risk of a Portfolio
In real-world situations, the risk of any single investment would not be viewed
independently of other assets. New investments must be considered in light of
their impact on the risk and return of an investor’s portfolio of assets. The finan-
cial manager’s goal is to create an efficient portfolio, one that provides the max-
imum return for a given level of risk. We therefore need a way to measure the
return and the standard deviation of a portfolio of assets. As part of that analysis,
we will look at the statistical concept of correlation, which underlies the process
of diversification that is used to develop an efficient portfolio.
PORTFOLIO RETURN AND STANDARD DEVIATION
The return on a portfolio is a weighted average of the returns on the individual
assets from which it is formed. We can use Equation 8.5 to find the portfolio
return, rp:
(8.5)
where
Of course, 
, which means that 100 percent of the portfolio’s assets
must be included in this computation.
James purchases 100 shares of Wal-Mart at a price of $55 per share, so his total
investment in Wal-Mart is $5,500. He also buys 100 shares of Cisco Systems at
$25 per share, so the total investment in Cisco stock is $2,500. Combining these
two holdings, James’s total portfolio is worth $8,000. Of the total, 68.75% is
invested in Wal-Mart ($5,500
$8,000) and 31.25% is invested in Cisco Systems
($2,500
$8,000). Thus, w1
0.6875, w2
0.3125, and

The standard deviation of a portfolio’s returns is found by applying the for-
mula for the standard deviation of a single asset. Specifically, Equation 8.3 is
used when the probabilities of the returns are known, and Equation 8.3a (from
footnote 4) is applied when analysts use historical data to estimate the standard
deviation.

Assume that we wish to determine the expected value and standard deviation of
returns for portfolio XY, created by combining equal portions (50% each) of
assets X and Y. The forecasted returns of assets X and Y for each of the next 5
years (2013–2017) are given in columns 1 and 2, respectively, in part A of Table
8.6. In column 3, the weights of 50% for both assets X and Y along with their
respective returns from columns 1 and 2 are substituted into Equation 8.5.
Column 4 shows the results of the calculation—an expected portfolio return of
12% for each year, 2013 to 2017.
Furthermore, as shown in part B of Table 8.6, the expected value of these
portfolio returns over the 5-year period is also 12% (calculated by using
Equation 8.2a, in footnote 3). In part C of Table 8.6, portfolio XY’s standard
deviation is calculated to be 0% (using Equation 8.3a, in footnote 4). This value
should not be surprising because the portfolio return each year is the same—
12%. Portfolio returns do not vary through time.

CORRELATION
Correlation is a statistical measure of the relationship between any two series of
numbers. The numbers may represent data of any kind, from returns to test
scores. If two series tend to vary in the same direction, they are positively corre-
lated. If the series vary in opposite directions, they are negatively correlated. For
example, suppose we gathered data on the retail price and weight of new cars. It
is likely that we would find that larger cars cost more than smaller ones, so we
would say that among new cars weight and price are positively correlated. If we
also measured the fuel efficiency of these vehicles (as measured by the number of
miles they can travel per gallon of gasoline), we would find that lighter cars are
more fuel efficient than heavier cars. In that case, we would say that fuel
economy and vehicle weight are negatively correlated.5
The degree of correlation is measured by the correlation coefficient, which
ranges from 
for perfectly positively correlated series to 
for perfectly nega-
tively correlated series. These two extremes are depicted for series M and N in
Figure 8.4. The perfectly positively correlated series move exactly together
without exception; the perfectly negatively correlated series move in exactly
opposite directions.
DIVERSIFICATION
The concept of correlation is essential to developing an efficient portfolio. To
reduce overall risk, it is best to diversify by combining, or adding to the portfolio,
assets that have the lowest possible correlation. Combining assets that have a low
correlation with each other can reduce the overall variability of a portfolio’s
returns. Figure 8.5 (see page 324) shows the returns that two assets, F and G,
earn over time. Both assets earn the same average or expected return, 
but
note that when F’s return is above average, the return on G is below average and
vice versa. In other words, returns on F and G are negatively correlated, and
when these two assets are combined in a portfolio, the risk of that portfolio falls
without reducing the average return (that is, the portfolio’s average return is also ).

economy than a smaller sedan powered by a conventional gas engine. This does not change the fact that the general

For risk-averse investors, this is very good news. They get rid of something that
they don’t like (risk) without having to sacrifice what they do like (return). Even
if assets are positively correlated, the lower the correlation between them, the
greater the risk reduction that can be achieved through diversification.
Some assets are uncorrelated—that is, there is no interaction between their
returns. Combining uncorrelated assets can reduce risk, not as effectively as
combining negatively correlated assets but more effectively than combining pos-
itively correlated assets. The correlation coefficient for uncorrelated assets is
close to zero and acts as the midpoint between perfect positive and perfect nega-
tive correlation.
The creation of a portfolio that combines two assets with perfectly positively
correlated returns results in overall portfolio risk that at minimum equals that of
the least risky asset and at maximum equals that of the most risky asset.
However, a portfolio combining two assets with less than perfectly positive cor-
relation can reduce total risk to a level below that of either of the components.
For example, assume that you buy stock in a company that manufactures
machine tools. The business is very cyclical, so the stock will do well when the
economy is expanding, and it will do poorly during a recession. If you bought
shares in another machine-tool company, with sales positively correlated with
those of your firm, the combined portfolio would still be cyclical and risk would
not be reduced a great deal. Alternatively, however, you could buy stock in a dis-
count retailer, whose sales are countercyclical. It typically performs worse during
economic expansions than it does during recessions (when consumers are trying
to save money on every purchase). A portfolio that contained both of these stocks
might be less volatile than either stock on its own.
Table 8.7 presents the forecasted returns from three different assets—X, Y, and
Z—over the next 5 years, along with their expected values and standard devia-
tions. Each of the assets has an expected return of 12% and a standard deviation
of 3.16%. The assets therefore have equal return and equal risk. The return pat-
terns of assets X and Y are perfectly negatively correlated. When X enjoys its
highest return, Y experiences its lowest return, and vice versa. The returns of
assets X and Z are perfectly positively correlated. They move in precisely the
same direction, so when the return on X is high, so is the return on Z. (Note: The

returns for X and Z are identical.)6 Now let’s consider what happens when we
combine these assets in different ways to form portfolios.
Portfolio XY
Portfolio XY (shown in Table 8.7) is created by combining equal
portions of assets X and Y, the perfectly negatively correlated assets. (Calculation
of portfolio XY’s annual returns, the expected portfolio return, and the standard
deviation of returns was demonstrated in Table 8.6 on page 322.) The risk in this
portfolio, as reflected by its standard deviation, is reduced to 0%, whereas the
expected return remains at 12%. Thus, the combination results in the complete
elimination of risk because in each and every year the portfolio earns a 12%
return.7 Whenever assets are perfectly negatively correlated, some combination of
the two assets exists such that the resulting portfolio’s returns are risk free.
Portfolio XZ
Portfolio XZ (shown in Table 8.7) is created by combining equal
portions of assets X and Z, the perfectly positively correlated assets. Individually,
assets X and Z have the same standard deviation, 3.16%, and because they

aPortfolio XY, which consists of 50 percent of asset X and 50 percent of asset Y, illustrates perfect negative correlation because these two return
streams behave in completely opposite fashion over the 5-year period. Its return values shown here were calculated in part A of Table 8.6.
bPortfolio XZ, which consists of 50 percent of asset X and 50 percent of asset Z, illustrates perfect positive correlation because these two return
streams behave identically over the 5-year period. Its return values were calculated by using the same method demonstrated for portfolio XY in part A
of Table 8.6.
cBecause the probabilities associated with the returns are not given, the general equations, Equation 8.2a in footnote 3 and Equation 8.3a in
footnote 4, were used to calculate expected values and standard deviations, respectively. Calculation of the expected value and standard deviation
for portfolio XY is demonstrated in parts B and C, respectively, of Table 8.6.
dThe portfolio standard deviations can be directly calculated from the standard deviations of the component assets with the following formula:
where w1 and w2 are the proportions of component assets 1 and 2, 
1 and
2 are the standard deviations of component assets 1 and 2, and c1,2 is
the correlation coefficient between the returns of component assets 1 and 2.

6. Identical return streams are used in this example to permit clear illustration of the concepts, but it is not necessary
for return streams to be identical for them to be perfectly positively correlated. Any return streams that move exactly
together—regardless of the relative magnitude of the returns—are perfectly positively correlated.
7. Perfect negative correlation means that the ups and downs experienced by one asset are exactly offset by move-
ments in the other asset. Therefore, the portfolio return does not vary over time.

always move together, combining them in a portfolio does nothing to reduce
risk—the portfolio standard deviation is also 3.16%. As was the case with port-
folio XY, the expected return of portfolio XZ is 12%. Because both of these port-
folios provide the same expected return, but portfolio XY achieves that expected
return with no risk, portfolio XY is clearly preferred by risk-averse investors over
portfolio XZ.
CORRELATION, DIVERSIFICATION, RISK, AND RETURN
In general, the lower the correlation between asset returns, the greater the risk
reduction that investors can achieve by diversifying. The following example illus-
trates how correlation influences the risk of a portfolio but not the portfolio’s
expected return.
Consider two assets—Lo and Hi—with the characteristics described in the table
below:

S
r
Clearly, asset Lo offers a lower return than Hi does, but Lo is also less risky than
Hi. It is natural to think that a portfolio combining Lo and Hi would offer a
return that is between 6% and 8% and that the portfolio’s risk would also fall
between the risk of Lo and Hi (between 3% and 8%). That intuition is only
partly correct.
The performance of a portfolio consisting of assets Lo and Hi depends not
only on the expected return and standard deviation of each asset (given above),
but also on how the returns on the two assets are correlated. We will illustrate the
results of three specific scenarios: (1) returns on Lo and Hi are perfectly positively
correlated, (2) returns on Lo and Hi are uncorrelated, and (3) returns on Lo and
Hi are perfectly negatively correlated.
The results of the analysis appear in Figure 8.6. Whether the correlation
between Lo and Hi is 
, 0, or 
, a portfolio of those two assets must have an
expected return between 6% and 8%. That is why the line segments at left in
Figure 8.6 all range between 6% and 8%. However, the standard deviation of a
portfolio depends critically on the correlation between Lo and Hi. Only when Lo
and Hi are perfectly positively correlated can it be said that the portfolio standard
deviation must fall between 3% (Lo’s standard deviation) and 8% (Hi’s standard
deviation). As the correlation between Lo and Hi becomes weaker (that is, as the
correlation coefficient falls), investors may find that they can form portfolios of
Lo and Hi with standard deviations that are even less than 3% (that is, portfolios
that are less risky than holding asset Lo by itself). That is why the line segments
at right in Figure 8.6 vary. In the special case when Lo and Hi are perfectly nega-
tively correlated, it is possible to diversify away all of the risk and form a port-
folio that is risk free.

INTERNATIONAL DIVERSIFICATION
One excellent practical example of portfolio diversification involves including
foreign assets in a portfolio. The inclusion of assets from countries with business
cycles that are not highly correlated with the U.S. business cycle reduces the port-
folio’s responsiveness to market movements. The ups and the downs of different
markets around the world offset each other, at least to some extent, and the result
is a portfolio that is less risky than one invested entirely in the U.S. market.
Returns from International Diversification
Over long periods, internationally diversified portfolios tend to perform better
(meaning that they earn higher returns relative to the risks taken) than purely
domestic portfolios. However, over shorter periods such as a year or two, interna-
tionally diversified portfolios may perform better or worse than domestic portfolios.
For example, consider what happens when the U.S. economy is performing rela-
tively poorly and the dollar is depreciating in value against most foreign currencies.
At such times, the dollar returns to U.S. investors on a portfolio of foreign assets can
be very attractive. However, international diversification can yield subpar returns,
particularly when the dollar is appreciating in value relative to other currencies.
When the U.S. currency appreciates, the dollar value of a foreign-currency-
denominated portfolio of assets declines. Even if this portfolio yields a satisfactory
return in foreign currency, the return to U.S. investors will be reduced when foreign
profits are translated into dollars. Subpar local currency portfolio returns, coupled
with an appreciating dollar, can yield truly dismal dollar returns to U.S. investors.
Overall, though, the logic of international portfolio diversification assumes
that these fluctuations in currency values and relative performance will average
out over long periods. Compared to similar, purely domestic portfolios, an inter-
nationally diversified portfolio will tend to yield a comparable return at a lower
level of risk.
Risks of International Diversification
In addition to the risk induced by currency fluctuations, several other financial
risks are unique to international investing. Most important is political risk, which

arises from the possibility that a host government will take actions harmful to
foreign investors or that political turmoil will endanger investments. Political
risks are particularly acute in developing countries, where unstable or ideologi-
cally motivated governments may attempt to block return of profits by foreign
investors or even seize (nationalize) their assets in the host country. For example,
reflecting President Chavez’s desire to broaden the country’s socialist revolution,
Venezuela issued a list of priority goods for import that excluded a large per-
centage of the necessary inputs to the automobile production process. As a result,
Toyota halted auto production in Venezuela, and three other auto manufacturers
temporarily closed or deeply cut their production there. Chavez also has forced
most foreign energy firms to reduce their stakes and give up control of oil projects
in Venezuela.

An International Flavor to Risk Reduction
Earlier in this chapter
(see Table 8.5 on
page 318), we learned that from
1900 through 2009 the U.S. stock
market produced an average annual
nominal return of 9.3 percent, but that
return was associated with a relatively
high standard deviation: 20.4 percent
per year. Could U.S. investors have
done better by diversifying globally?
The answer is a qualified yes. Elroy
Dimson, Paul Marsh, and Mike
Staunton calculated the historical returns
on a portfolio that included U.S. stocks
as well as stocks from 18 other coun-
tries. This diversified portfolio produced
returns that were not quite as high as
the U.S. average, just 8.6 percent per
year. However, the globally diversified
portfolio was also less volatile, with an
annual standard deviation of 17.8 per-
cent. Dividing the standard deviation
by the annual return produces a coeffi-
cient of variation for the globally 
diversified portfolio of 2.07, slightly
lower than the 2.10 coefficient of 
variation reported for U.S. stocks in
Table 8.5.

8.4 Risk and Return: The Capital Asset Pricing 
Model (CAPM)
Thus far we have observed a tendency for riskier investments to earn higher
returns, and we have learned that investors can reduce risk through diversifica-
tion. Now we want to quantify the relationship between risk and return. In other
words, we want to measure how much additional return an investor should expect
from taking a little extra risk. The classic theory that links risk and return for all
assets is the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). We will use the CAPM to under-
stand the basic risk–return tradeoffs involved in all types of financial decisions.
TYPES OF RISK
In the last section we saw that the standard deviation of a portfolio is often less
than the standard deviation of the individual assets in the portfolio. That’s the
power of diversification. To see this more clearly, consider what happens to the
risk of a portfolio consisting of a single security (asset), to which we add securi-
ties randomly selected from, say, the population of all actively traded securities.
Using the standard deviation of return, 
rp, to measure the total portfolio risk,
Figure 8.7 depicts the behavior of the total portfolio risk (y axis) as more securi-
ties are added (x axis). With the addition of securities, the total portfolio risk
declines, as a result of diversification, and tends to approach a lower limit.
The total risk of a security can be viewed as consisting of two parts:
(8.6)
Diversifiable risk (sometimes called unsystematic risk) represents the portion of
an asset’s risk that is associated with random causes that can be eliminated
through diversification. It is attributable to firm-specific events, such as strikes,
lawsuits, regulatory actions, or the loss of a key account. Figure 8.7 shows that
diversifiable risk gradually disappears as the number of stocks in the portfolio
increases. Nondiversifiable risk (also called systematic risk) is attributable to

market factors that affect all firms; it cannot be eliminated through diversifica-
tion. Factors such as war, inflation, the overall state of the economy, international
incidents, and political events account for nondiversifiable risk. In Figure 8.7,
nondiversifiable risk is represented by the horizontal black line below which the
blue curve can never go, no matter how diversified the portfolio becomes.
Because any investor can easily create a portfolio of assets that will eliminate
virtually all diversifiable risk, the only relevant risk is nondiversifiable risk. Any
investor or firm therefore must be concerned solely with nondiversifiable risk.
The measurement of nondiversifiable risk is thus of primary importance in
selecting assets with the most desired risk–return characteristics.
THE MODEL: CAPM
The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) links nondiversifiable risk to expected
returns. We will discuss the model in five sections. The first section deals with the
beta coefficient, which is a measure of nondiversifiable risk. The second section
presents an equation of the model itself, and the third section graphically describes
the relationship between risk and return. The fourth section discusses the effects of
changes in inflationary expectations and risk aversion on the relationship between
risk and return. The fifth section offers some comments on the CAPM.
Beta Coefficient
The beta coefficient, b, is a relative measure of nondiversifiable risk. It is an index
of the degree of movement of an asset’s return in response to a change in the
market return. An asset’s historical returns are used in finding the asset’s beta
coefficient. The market return is the return on the market portfolio of all traded
securities. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Composite Index or some similar
stock index is commonly used as the market return. Betas for actively traded
stocks can be obtained from a variety of sources, but you should understand how
they are derived and interpreted and how they are applied to portfolios.
Deriving Beta from Return Data
An asset’s historical returns are used in
finding the asset’s beta coefficient. Figure 8.8 plots the relationship between the
returns of two assets—R and S—and the market return. Note that the horizontal
(x) axis measures the historical market returns and that the vertical (y) axis meas-
ures the individual asset’s historical returns. The first step in deriving beta
involves plotting the coordinates for the market return and asset returns from
various points in time. Such annual “market return–asset return” coordinates are
shown for asset S only for the years 2005 through 2012. For example, in 2012,
asset S’s return was 20 percent when the market return was 10 percent. By use of
statistical techniques, the “characteristic line” that best explains the relationship
between the asset return and the market return coordinates is fit to the data
points.8 The slope of this line is beta. The beta for asset R is about 0.80, and that
for asset S is about 1.30. Asset S’s higher beta (steeper characteristic line slope)
indicates that its return is more responsive to changing market returns. Therefore
asset S is more risky than asset R.

8. The empirical measurement of beta is approached by using least-squares regression analysis.

Interpreting Betas
The beta coefficient for the entire market equals 1.0. All
other betas are viewed in relation to this value. Asset betas may be positive or neg-
ative, but positive betas are the norm. The majority of beta coefficients fall between
0.5 and 2.0. The return of a stock that is half as responsive as the market 
should change by 0.5 percent for each 1 percent change in the return of the market
portfolio. A stock that is twice as responsive as the market 
should expe-
rience a 2 percent change in its return for each 1 percent change in the return of the
market portfolio. Table 8.8 provides various beta values and their interpretations.
Beta coefficients for actively traded stocks can be obtained from published sources
such as Value Line Investment Survey, via the Internet, or through brokerage firms.
Betas for some selected stocks are given in Table 8.9.

Portfolio Betas
The beta of a portfolio can be easily estimated by using the
betas of the individual assets it includes. Letting wj represent the proportion of
the portfolio’s total dollar value represented by asset j, and letting bj equal the
beta of asset j, we can use Equation 8.7 to find the portfolio beta, bp:
(8.7)
Of course, 
, which means that 100 percent of the portfolio’s assets
must be included in this computation.
Portfolio betas are interpreted in the same way as the betas of individual
assets. They indicate the degree of responsiveness of the portfolio’s return to
changes in the market return. For example, when the market return increases by
10 percent, a portfolio with a beta of 0.75 will experience a 7.5 percent increase
in its return 
; a portfolio with a beta of 1.25 will experience a 
12.5 percent increase in its return 
. Clearly, a portfolio containing
mostly low-beta assets will have a low beta, and one containing mostly high-beta
assets will have a high beta.
Mario Austino, an individual investor, wishes to assess the risk
of two small portfolios he is considering—V and W. Both port-
folios contain five assets, with the proportions and betas shown in Table 8.10.
The betas for the two portfolios, bV and bW, can be calculated by substituting
data from the table into Equation 8.7:
= 0.080 + 0.100 + 0.130 + 0.075 + 0.525 = 0.91
bW = (0.10 * .80) + (0.10 * 1.00) + (0.20 * .65) + (0.10 * .75) + (0.50 * 1.05)

Portfolio V’s beta is about 1.20, and portfolio W’s is 0.91. These values make
sense because portfolio V contains relatively high-beta assets, and portfolio W
contains relatively low-beta assets. Mario’s calculations show that portfolio V’s
returns are more responsive to changes in market returns and are therefore more
risky than portfolio W’s. He must now decide which, if either, portfolio he feels
comfortable adding to his existing investments.
The Equation
Using the beta coefficient to measure nondiversifiable risk, the capital asset
pricing model (CAPM) is given in Equation 8.8:
(8.8)
where
on a U.S. Treasury bill
The CAPM can be divided into two parts: (1) the risk-free rate of return, RF,
which is the required return on a risk-free asset, typically a 3-month U.S.
Treasury bill (T-bill), a short-term IOU issued by the U.S. Treasury, and (2) the
risk premium. These are, respectively, the two elements on either side of the plus
sign in Equation 8.8. The (rm
RF) portion of the risk premium is called the
market risk premium because it represents the premium the investor must
receive for taking the average amount of risk associated with holding the market
portfolio of assets.
Historical Risk Premiums
Using the historical return data for stocks,
bonds, and Treasury bills for the 1900–2009 period shown in Table 8.1, 
we can calculate the risk premiums for each investment category. The calcula-
tion (consistent with Equation 8.8) involves merely subtracting the historical

Reviewing the risk premiums calculated above, we can see that the risk pre-
mium is higher for stocks than for bonds. This outcome makes sense intuitively
because stocks are riskier than bonds (equity is riskier than debt).
Benjamin Corporation, a growing computer software developer, wishes to deter-
mine the required return on an asset Z, which has a beta of 1.5. The risk-free rate
of return is 7%; the return on the market portfolio of assets is 11%. Substituting
, and 
into the capital asset pricing model given in
Equation 8.8 yields a required return of
The market risk premium of 
when adjusted for the asset’s
index of risk (beta) of 1.5, results in a risk premium of 6% (1.5
4%). That risk
premium, when added to the 7% risk-free rate, results in a 13% required return.
Other things being equal, the higher the beta, the higher the required return,
and the lower the beta, the lower the required return.
The Graph: The Security Market Line (SML)
When the capital asset pricing model (Equation 8.8) is depicted graphically, it is
called the security market line (SML). The SML will, in fact, be a straight line. It
reflects the required return in the marketplace for each level of nondiversifiable
risk (beta). In the graph, risk as measured by beta, b, is plotted on the x axis, and
required returns, r, are plotted on the y axis. The risk–return trade-off is clearly
represented by the SML.
In the preceding example for Benjamin Corporation, the risk-free rate, RF, was
7%, and the market return, rm, was 11%. The SML can be plotted by using the
two sets of coordinates for the betas associated with RF and rm,
and bm (that
is,

resulting security market line. As traditionally shown, the security market line in

9. Because RF is the rate of return on a risk-free asset, the beta associated with the risk-free asset, 
, would equal
0. The zero beta on the risk-free asset reflects not only its absence of risk but also that the asset’s return is unaffected
by movements in the market return.

asset pricing model (CAPM) as
a graph that reflects the
required return in the
marketplace for each level of
nondiversifiable risk (beta).

Figure 8.9 presents the required return associated with all positive betas. The
market risk premium of 4% 
of 7%) has been highlighted. For a
beta for asset Z, bZ, of 1.5, its corresponding required return, rZ, is 13%. Also
shown in the figure is asset Z’s risk premium of 6% (rZ of 
of 7%). It
should be clear that for assets with betas greater than 1, the risk premium is
greater than that for the market; for assets with betas less than 1, the risk pre-
mium is less than that for the market.
Shifts in the Security Market Line
The security market line is not stable over time, and shifts in the security market
line can result in a change in required return. The position and slope of the SML
are affected by two major forces—inflationary expectations and risk aversion—
which are analyzed next.10
Changes in Inflationary Expectations
Changes in inflationary expectations
affect the risk-free rate of return, RF. The equation for the risk-free rate of return is
(8.9)
This equation shows that, assuming a constant real rate of interest, r*, changes in
inflationary expectations, reflected in an inflation premium, IP, will result in 
corresponding changes in the risk-free rate. Therefore, a change in inflationary

external factors not within management’s control, such as earthquakes, toxic spills, and so on.

expectations that results from events such as international trade embargoes or
major changes in Federal Reserve policy will result in a shift in the SML. Because
the risk-free rate is a basic component of all rates of return, any change in RF will
be reflected in all required rates of return.
Changes in inflationary expectations result in parallel shifts in the SML in
direct response to the magnitude and direction of the change. This effect can best
be illustrated by an example.
In the preceding example, using the CAPM, the required return for asset Z, rZ, was
found to be 13%. Assuming that the risk-free rate of 7% includes a 2% real rate of
interest, r*, and a 5% inflation premium, IP, then Equation 8.9 confirms that
Now assume that recent economic events have resulted in an increase of 3%
in inflationary expectations, raising the inflation premium to 8% (IP1). As a
result, all returns likewise rise by 3%. In this case, the new returns (noted by sub-
script 1) are
Substituting these values, along with asset Z’s beta (bZ) of 1.5, into the CAPM
(Equation 8.8), we find that asset Z’s new required return (
) can be calculated:
Comparing 
of 16% to rZ of 13%, we see that the change of 3% in asset Z’s
required return exactly equals the change in the inflation premium. The same 3%
increase results for all assets.
Figure 8.10 depicts the situation just described. It shows that the 3% increase
in inflationary expectations results in a parallel shift upward of 3% in the SML.
Clearly, the required returns on all assets rise by 3%. Note that the rise in the
inflation premium from 5% to 8% (IP to IP1) causes the risk-free rate to rise
from 7% to 10% (RF to 
) and the market return to increase from 11% to 14%
(rm to 
). The security market line therefore shifts upward by 3% (SML to
SML1), causing the required return on all risky assets, such as asset Z, to rise by
3%. The important lesson here is that a given change in inflationary expectations
will be fully reflected in a corresponding change in the returns of all assets, as
reflected graphically in a parallel shift of the SML.
Changes in Risk Aversion
The slope of the security market line reflects the
general risk preferences of investors in the marketplace. As discussed earlier, most
investors are risk averse—they require increased returns for increased risk. This
positive relationship between risk and return is graphically represented by the
SML, which depicts the relationship between nondiversifiable risk as measured
by beta (x axis) and the required return (y axis). The slope of the SML reflects the
degree of risk aversion: the steeper its slope, the greater the degree of risk aver-
sion because a higher level of return will be required for each level of risk as
measured by beta. In other words, risk premiums increase with increasing risk
avoidance.

PART 4
Risk and the Required Rate of Return

Changes in risk aversion, and therefore shifts in the SML, result from
changing preferences of investors, which generally result from economic, polit-
ical, and social events. Examples of events that increase risk aversion include a
stock market crash, assassination of a key political leader, and the outbreak of
war. In general, widely shared expectations of hard times ahead tend to cause
investors to become more risk averse, requiring higher returns as compensation
for accepting a given level of risk. The impact of increased risk aversion on the
SML can best be demonstrated by an example.
In the preceding examples, the SML in Figure 8.9 reflected a risk-free rate (RF) of
7%, a market return (rm) of 11%, a market risk premium (rm
RF) of 4%, and a
required return on asset Z (rZ) of 13% with a beta (bZ) of 1.5. Assume that recent
economic events have made investors more risk-averse, causing a new higher
market return (
) of 14%. Graphically, this change would cause the SML to
pivot upward as shown in Figure 8.11, causing a new market risk premium 
(
) of 7%. As a result, the required return on all risky assets will increase.
For asset Z, with a beta of 1.5, the new required return (
) can be calculated by
using the CAPM (Equation 8.8):
This value can be seen on the new security market line (SML1) in Figure 8.11.
Note that although asset Z’s risk, as measured by beta, did not change, its
required return has increased because of the increased risk aversion reflected in
the market risk premium. To summarize, greater risk aversion results in higher
required returns for each level of risk. Similarly, a reduction in risk aversion
causes the required return for each level of risk to decline.

Some Comments on the CAPM
The capital asset pricing model generally relies on historical data. The betas may
or may not actually reflect the future variability of returns. Therefore, the
required returns specified by the model can be viewed only as rough approxima-
tions. Users of betas commonly make subjective adjustments to the historically
determined betas to reflect their expectations of the future.
The CAPM was developed to explain the behavior of security prices and pro-
vide a mechanism whereby investors could assess the impact of a proposed secu-
rity investment on their portfolio’s overall risk and return. It is based on an
assumed efficient market with the following characteristics: many small investors,
all having the same information and expectations with respect to securities; no
restrictions on investment, no taxes, and no transaction costs; and rational
investors, who view securities similarly and are risk averse, preferring higher
returns and lower risk.
Although the perfect world described in the preceding paragraph appears to
be unrealistic, studies have provided support for the existence of the expecta-
tional relationship described by the CAPM in active markets such as the New
York Stock Exchange. The CAPM also sees widespread use in corporations that
use the model to assess the required returns that their shareholders demand (and
therefore, the returns that the firm’s managers need to achieve when they invest
shareholders’ money).

CHAPTER 8
Risk and Return
339
Summary
FOCUS ON VALUE
A firm’s risk and expected return directly affect its share price. Risk and return
are the two key determinants of the firm’s value. It is therefore the financial man-
ager’s responsibility to assess carefully the risk and return of all major decisions
to ensure that the expected returns justify the level of risk being introduced.
The financial manager can expect to achieve the firm’s goal of increasing its
share price (and thereby benefiting its owners) by taking only those actions that
earn returns at least commensurate with their risk. Clearly, financial managers
need to recognize, measure, and evaluate risk–return trade-offs to ensure that
their decisions contribute to the creation of value for owners.
REVIEW OF LEARNING GOALS
Understand the meaning and fundamentals of risk, return, and risk pref-
erences. Risk is a measure of the uncertainty surrounding the return that an
investment will produce. The total rate of return is the sum of cash distribu-
tions, such as interest or dividends, plus the change in the asset’s value over a
given period, divided by the investment’s beginning-of-period value. Investment
returns vary both over time and between different types of investments.
Investors may be risk averse, risk neutral, or risk seeking. Most financial deci-
sion makers are risk averse. A risk averse decision maker requires a higher
expected return on a more risky investment alternative.
Describe procedures for assessing and measuring the risk of a single
asset. The risk of a single asset is measured in much the same way as the risk of
a portfolio of assets. Scenario analysis and probability distributions can be used
to assess risk. The range, the standard deviation, and the coefficient of variation
can be used to measure risk quantitatively.
Discuss the measurement of return and standard deviation for a port-
folio and the concept of correlation. The return of a portfolio is calculated as
the weighted average of returns on the individual assets from which it is formed.
The portfolio standard deviation is found by using the formula for the standard
deviation of a single asset.

LG 2
LG 1

Correlation—the statistical relationship between any two series of num-
bers—can be positively correlated, negatively correlated, or uncorrelated. At the
extremes, the series can be perfectly positively correlated or perfectly negatively
correlated.
Understand the risk and return characteristics of a portfolio in terms of
correlation and diversification and the impact of international assets on a port-
folio. Diversification involves combining assets with low correlation to reduce
the risk of the portfolio. The range of risk in a two-asset portfolio depends on the
correlation between the two assets. If they are perfectly positively correlated, the
portfolio’s risk will be between the individual assets’ risks. If they are perfectly
negatively correlated, the portfolio’s risk will be between the risk of the more
risky asset and zero.
International diversification can further reduce a portfolio’s risk. Foreign
assets have the risk of currency fluctuation and political risks.
Review the two types of risk and the derivation and role of beta in meas-
uring the relevant risk of both a security and a portfolio. The total risk of a security
consists of nondiversifiable and diversifiable risk. Diversifiable risk can be elimi-
nated through diversification. Nondiversifiable risk is the only relevant risk.
Nondiversifiable risk is measured by the beta coefficient, which is a relative
measure of the relationship between an asset’s return and the market return. Beta is
derived by finding the slope of the “characteristic line” that best explains the his-
torical relationship between the asset’s return and the market return. The beta of a
portfolio is a weighted average of the betas of the individual assets that it includes.
Explain the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), its relationship to the
security market line (SML), and the major forces causing shifts in the SML. The
CAPM uses beta to relate an asset’s risk relative to the market to the asset’s
required return. The graphical depiction of the CAPM is SML, which shifts over
time in response to changing inflationary expectations and/or changes in
investor risk aversion. Changes in inflationary expectations result in parallel
shifts in the SML. Increasing risk aversion results in a steepening in the slope of
the SML. Decreasing risk aversion reduces the slope of the SML. Although it has
some shortcomings, the CAPM provides a useful conceptual framework for
evaluating and linking risk and return.

confident that the return will be positive but not large, so you arbitrarily assign
probabilities of being correct of 35%, 5%, 20%, and 40%, respectively, to the

Falling Short of Expectations

or years, General Electric was perhaps the most
admired company in the world. From 1990
through 2000, its stock rose more than 800 percent,
making it one of the world’s most valuable companies
and earning its long-time CEO, Jack Welch, the title of
“Manager of the Century” from Fortune magazine.
GE’s stock price peaked in August 2000 at $60.50.
Since then, however, GE stock has lost its luster, falling
by roughly 50 percent and trailing far behind benchmarks such as the Standard & Poor’s 500
Stock Index. In 2009, GE cut its dividend for the first time since the Great Depression and lost its
coveted AAA credit rating.
Why did GE perform so poorly? A simple answer is that GE’s business investments failed
to earn a return sufficient to meet the expectations of investors. When a firm’s operating results
disappoint investors, its stock price will fall as investors sell their shares and move to a more
attractive investment. As one expert explained, “GE has been destroying shareholder capital for
years. Their cost of capital is about 5 percent, and their return on assets is about 1 percent. That
mathematic equation can’t remain too much longer.”1
For companies to succeed, their investments have to earn a rate of return that exceeds
investors’ expectations. But how do companies know what investors expect? The answer is that
companies have to measure their cost of capital. Read on to learn how firms do that.

PART 4
Risk and the Required Rate of Return
9.1 Overview of the Cost of Capital
Chapter 1 established that the goal of the firm is to maximize shareholder wealth,
and it told us that financial managers achieve this goal by investing in risky proj-
ects that add value to the firm. In this chapter, you will learn about the cost of
capital, which is the rate of return that financial managers use to evaluate all pos-
sible investment opportunities to determine which ones to invest in on behalf of
the firm’s shareholders. The cost of capital represents the firm’s cost of financing
and is the minimum rate of return that a project must earn to increase firm value.
In particular, the cost of capital refers to the cost of the next dollar of financing
necessary to finance a new investment opportunity. Investments with a rate of
return above the cost of capital will increase the value of the firm, and projects
with a rate of return below the cost of capital will decrease firm value.
The cost of capital is an extremely important financial concept. It acts as a major
link between the firm’s long-term investment decisions and the wealth of the firm’s
owners as determined by the market value of their shares. Financial managers are
ethically bound to invest only in projects that they expect to exceed the cost of cap-
ital; see the Focus on Ethics box for more discussion of this responsibility.
THE BASIC CONCEPT
A firm’s cost of capital is estimated at a given point in time and reflects the expected
average future cost of funds over the long run. Although firms typically raise

focus on ETHICS
The Ethics of Profit
Business Week once
referred to Peter
Drucker as “The Man Who Invented
Management.” In his role as writer and
management consultant, Drucker
stressed the importance of ethics to
business leaders. He believed that it
was the ethical responsibility of a busi-
ness to earn a profit. In his mind, prof-
itable businesses create opportunities,
while unprofitable ones waste society’s
resources. Drucker once said, “Profit is
not the explanation, cause, or rationale
of business behavior and business deci-
sions, but rather the test of their validity.
If archangels instead of businessmen
sat in directors’ chairs, they would still
have to be concerned with profitability,
despite their total lack of personal inter-
est in making profits.”a
But what happens when businesses
abandon ethics for profits? Consider
Merck’s experience with the drug,
Vioxx. Introduced in 1999, Vioxx was
an immediate success, quickly reaching
$2.5 billion in annual sales. However,
a Merck study launched in 1999 even-
tually found that patients who took
Vioxx suffered from an increased risk of
heart attacks and strokes. Despite the
risks, Merck continued to market and
sell Vioxx. By the time Vioxx was with-
drawn from the market, an estimated
20 million Americans had taken the
drug, 88,000 had suffered Vioxx-
related heart attacks, and 38,000 had
died.
News of the 2004 Vioxx with-
drawal hit Merck’s stock hard. The
company’s shares fell 27 percent on
the day of the announcement, slashing
$27 billion off the firm’s market capital-
ization. Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s,
and Fitch cut Merck’s credit ratings,
costing the firm its coveted AAA rating.
The company’s bottom line also suf-
fered, as net income fell 21 percent in
the final three months of 2004.
The recall dealt a major blow to
Merck’s reputation. The company was
criticized for aggressively marketing
Vioxx despite its serious side effects.
Questions were also raised about the
research reports Merck had submitted
in support of the drug. Lawsuits fol-
lowed. In 2008, Merck agreed to fund
a $4.85 billion settlement to resolve
approximately 50,000 Vioxx-related
lawsuits. The company had also
incurred $1.53 billion in legal costs by
the time of the settlement.
3 The Vioxx recall increased Merck’s
cost of capital. What effect would
an increased cost of capital have on
a firm’s future investments?
in practice
aPeter F. Drucker, The Essential Drucker (New York: Collins Business Essentials, 2001).

money in lumps, the cost of capital reflects the entirety of the firm’s financing activ-
ities. For example, if a firm raises funds with debt (borrowing) today and at some
future point sells common stock to raise additional financing, then the respective
costs of both forms of capital should be reflected in the firm’s cost of capital. Most
firms attempt to maintain an optimal mix of debt and equity financing. In practice,
this mix is commonly a range, such as 40 percent to 50 percent debt, rather than a
point, such as 55 percent debt. This range is called a target capital structure—a
topic that will be addressed in Chapter 13. Here, it is sufficient to say that although
firms raise money in lumps, they tend toward some desired mix of financing.
To capture all of the relevant financing costs, assuming some desired mix of
financing, we need to look at the overall cost of capital rather than just the cost
of any single source of financing.
A firm is currently faced with an investment opportunity. Assume the following:
Best project available today
Least costly financing source available
Because it can earn 7% on the investment of funds costing only 6%, the firm
undertakes the opportunity. Imagine that 1 week later a new investment opportu-
nity is available:
Best project available 1 week later
Least costly financing source available
In this instance, the firm rejects the opportunity because the 14% financing cost
is greater than the 12% expected return.
What if instead the firm used a combined cost of financing? By weighting the
cost of each source of financing by its relative proportion in the firm’s target cap-
ital structure, the firm can obtain a weighted average cost of capital. Assuming
that a 50–50 mix of debt and equity is targeted, the weighted average cost here
would be 
. With this average
cost of financing, the first opportunity would have been rejected (7% expected
return
10% weighted average cost), and the second would have been accepted
(12% expected return
10% weighted average cost).
SOURCES OF LONG-TERM CAPITAL
In this chapter, our concern is only with the long-term sources of capital available to
a firm because these are the sources that supply the financing necessary to support
the firm’s capital budgeting activities. Capital budgeting is the process of evaluating

and selecting long-term investments. This process is intended to achieve the firm’s
goal of maximizing shareholders’ wealth. Although the entire capital budgeting
process is discussed throughout Part 5, at this point it is sufficient to say that cap-
ital budgeting activities are chief among the responsibilities of financial managers
and that they cannot be carried out without knowing the appropriate cost of cap-
ital with which to judge the firm’s investment opportunities.
There are four basic sources of long-term capital for firms: long-term debt, pre-
ferred stock, common stock, and retained earnings. All entries on the right-hand
side of the balance sheet, other than current liabilities, represent these sources:

Not every firm will use all of these sources of financing, but most firms will have
some mix of funds from these sources in their capital structures. Although a firm’s
existing mix of financing sources may reflect its target capital structure, it is ulti-
mately the marginal cost of capital necessary to raise the next marginal dollar of
financing that is relevant for evaluating the firm’s future investment opportunities.

9.2 Cost of Long-Term Debt
The cost of long-term debt is the financing cost associated with new funds raised
through long-term borrowing. Typically, the funds are raised through the sale of
corporate bonds.
NET PROCEEDS
The net proceeds from the sale of a bond, or any security, are the funds that the
firm receives from the sale. The total proceeds are reduced by the flotation costs,

which represent the total costs of issuing and selling securities. These costs apply
to all public offerings of securities—debt, preferred stock, and common stock.
They include two components: (1) underwriting costs—compensation earned by
investment bankers for selling the security—and (2) administrative costs—issuer
expenses such as legal, accounting, and printing.
Duchess Corporation, a major hardware manufacturer, is contemplating selling
$10 million worth of 20-year, 9% coupon (stated annual interest rate) bonds,
each with a par value of $1,000. Because bonds with similar risk earn returns
greater than 9%, the firm must sell the bonds for $980 to compensate for the
lower coupon interest rate. The flotation costs are 2% of the par value of the
bond (0.02
$1,000), or $20. The net proceeds to the firm from the sale of each
bond are therefore $960 ($980 minus $20).
BEFORE-TAX COST OF DEBT
The before-tax cost of debt, rd, is simply the rate of return the firm must pay on
new borrowing. A firm’s before-tax cost of debt for bonds can be found in any of
three ways: quotation, calculation, or approximation.
Using Market Quotations
A relatively quick method for finding the before-tax cost of debt is to observe the
yield to maturity (YTM) on the firm’s existing bonds or bonds of similar risk
issued by other companies. The market price of existing bonds reflects the rate of
return required by the market. For example, if the market requires a YTM of 9.7
percent for a similar-risk bond, then this value can be used as the before-tax cost
of debt, rd, for new bonds. Bond yields are widely reported by sources such as
The Wall Street Journal.
Calculating the Cost
This approach finds the before-tax cost of debt by calculating the YTM generated
by the bond cash flows. From the issuer’s point of view, this value is the cost to
maturity of the cash flows associated with the debt. The cost to maturity can be
calculated by using a financial calculator or an electronic spreadsheet. It repre-
sents the annual before-tax percentage cost of the debt.
In the preceding example, $960 were the net proceeds of a 20-year bond with a
$1,000 par value and 9% coupon interest rate. The calculation of the annual cost
is quite simple. The cash flow pattern associated with this bond’s sales consists of
an initial inflow (the net proceeds) followed by a series of annual outlays (the
interest payments). In the final year, when the debt is retired, an outlay repre-
senting the repayment of the principal also occurs. The cash flows associated
with Duchess Corporation’s bond issue are as follows:

The initial $960 inflow is followed by annual interest outflows of $90 (9%
coupon interest rate
$1,000 par value) over the 20-year life of the bond. In
year 20, an outflow of $1,000 (the repayment of the principal) occurs. We can
determine the cost of debt by finding the YTM, which is the discount rate that
equates the present value of the bond outflows to the initial inflow.
Calculator Use
(Note: Most calculators require either the present value [net
proceeds] or the future value [annual interest payments and repayment of prin-
cipal] to be input as negative numbers when we calculate yield to maturity. That
approach is used here.) Using the calculator and the inputs shown at the left, you
should find the before-tax cost of debt (yield to maturity) to be 9.452%.
Spreadsheet Use
The before-tax cost of debt on the Duchess Corporation bond
can be calculated using an Excel spreadsheet. The following Excel spreadsheet
shows that by referencing the cells containing the bond’s net proceeds, coupon
payment, years to maturity, and par value as part of Excel’s RATE function you
can quickly determine that the appropriate before-tax cost of debt for Duchess
Corporation’s bond is 9.452%.

Although you may not recognize it, both the calculator and the Excel function are
using trial-and-error to find the bond’s YTM—they just do it faster than you can.
Approximating the Cost
Although not as precise as using a calculator, there is a method for quickly approx-
imating the before-tax cost of debt. The before-tax cost of debt, rd, for a bond with
a $1,000 par value can be approximated by using the following equation:
(9.1)
where
 n = number of years to the bond’s maturity
 Nd = net proceeds from the sale of debt (bond)
 I = annual interest in dollars
rd =
I + $1,000 - Nd
n
Nd + $1,000

Substituting the appropriate values from the Duchess Corporation example into
the approximation formula given in Equation 9.1, we get:
This approximate value of before-tax cost of debt is close to the 9.452%, but it
lacks the precision of the value derived using the calculator or spreadsheet.
AFTER-TAX COST OF DEBT
Unlike the dividends paid to equityholders, the interest payments paid to bond-
holders are tax deductable for the firm, so the interest expense on debt reduces
the firm’s taxable income and, therefore, the firm’s tax liability. To find the firm’s
net cost of debt, we must account for the tax savings created by debt and solve
for the cost of long-term debt on an after-tax basis. The after-tax cost of debt, ri,
can be found by multiplying the before-tax cost, rd, by 1 minus the tax rate, T, as
stated in the following equation:
(9.2)
Duchess Corporation has a 40% tax rate. Using the 9.452% before-tax debt cost
calculated above, and applying Equation 9.2, we find an after-tax cost of debt of
Typically, the cost of long-term debt for a given
firm is less than the cost of preferred or common stock, partly because of the tax
deductibility of interest.
Kait and Kasim Sullivan, a married couple in the 28% federal
income-tax bracket, wish to borrow $60,000 to pay for a new
luxury car. To finance the purchase, they can either borrow the $60,000
through the auto dealer at an annual interest rate of 6.0%, or they can take a
$60,000 second mortgage on their home. The best annual rate they can get on
the second mortgage is 7.2%. They already have qualified for both of the loans
being considered.
If they borrow from the auto dealer, the interest on this “consumer loan” will
not be deductible for federal tax purposes. However, the interest on the second
mortgage would be tax deductible because the tax law allows individuals to
deduct interest paid on a home mortgage. To choose the least-cost financing, the
Sullivans calculated the after-tax cost of both sources of long-term debt. Because
interest on the auto loan is not tax deductible, its after-tax cost equals its stated

9.3 Cost of Preferred Stock
Preferred stock represents a special type of ownership interest in the firm. It gives
preferred stockholders the right to receive their stated dividends before the firm
can distribute any earnings to common stockholders. The key characteristics of
preferred stock were described in Chapter 7. However, the one aspect of pre-
ferred stock that requires review is dividends.
PREFERRED STOCK DIVIDENDS
Most preferred stock dividends are stated as a dollar amount: “x dollars per year.”
When dividends are stated this way, the stock is often referred to as “x-dollar pre-
ferred stock.” Thus a “$4 preferred stock” is expected to pay preferred stockholders
$4 in dividends each year on each share of preferred stock owned.
Sometimes preferred stock dividends are stated as an annual percentage 
rate. This rate represents the percentage of the stock’s par, or face, value that
equals the annual dividend. For instance, an 8 percent preferred stock with a 
$50 par value would be expected to pay an annual dividend of $4 per share
Before the cost of preferred stock is calculated, any divi-
dends stated as percentages should be converted to annual dollar dividends.
CALCULATING THE COST OF PREFERRED STOCK
The cost of preferred stock, rp, is the ratio of the preferred stock dividend to the
firm’s net proceeds from the sale of the preferred stock. The net proceeds repre-
sent the amount of money to be received minus any flotation costs. Equation 9.3
gives the cost of preferred stock, rp, in terms of the annual dollar dividend, Dp,
and the net proceeds from the sale of the stock, Np:
(9.3)

Duchess Corporation is contemplating issuance of a 10% preferred stock that
they expect to sell for $87 per share. The cost of issuing and selling the stock will
be $5 per share. The first step in finding the cost of the stock is to calculate the
dollar amount of the annual preferred dividend, which is 
The net proceeds per share from the proposed sale of stock equals the sale price
minus the flotation costs 
Substituting the annual dividend,
Dp, of $8.70 and the net proceeds, Np, of $82 into Equation 9.3 gives the cost of
preferred stock, 
The cost of Duchess’s preferred stock (10.6%) is much greater than the cost
of its long-term debt (5.67%). This difference exists both because the cost of
long-term debt (the interest) is tax deductible and because preferred stock is
riskier than long-term debt.

9.4 Cost of Common Stock
The cost of common stock is the return required on the stock by investors in the
marketplace. There are two forms of common stock financing: (1) retained earn-
ings and (2) new issues of common stock. As a first step in finding each of these
costs, we must estimate the cost of common stock equity.
FINDING THE COST OF COMMON STOCK EQUITY
The cost of common stock equity, rs, is the rate at which investors discount the
expected common stock dividends of the firm to determine its share value. Two tech-
niques are used to measure the cost of common stock equity. One relies on the con-
stant-growth valuation model, the other on the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).
Using the Constant-Growth Valuation (Gordon Growth) Model
In Chapter 7 we found the value of a share of stock to be equal to the present
value of all future dividends, which in one model were assumed to grow at a con-
stant annual rate over an infinite time horizon. This is the constant-growth valu-
ation model, also known as the Gordon growth model. The key expression
derived for this model was presented as Equation 7.4 and is restated here:
(9.4)
where
 g = constant rate of growth in dividends
 rs = required return on common stock
 D1 = per-share dividend expected at the end of year 1
 P0 = value of common stock

constant-growth valuation
(Gordon growth) model
Assumes that the value of a
share of stock equals the
present value of all future
dividends (assumed to grow at
a constant rate) that it is
expected to provide over an
infinite time horizon.

Solving Equation 9.4 for rs results in the following expression for the cost of
common stock equity:
(9.5)
Equation 9.5 indicates that the cost of common stock equity can be found by
dividing the dividend expected at the end of year 1 by the current market price of
the stock (the “dividend yield”) and adding the expected growth rate (the “cap-
ital gains yield”).
Duchess Corporation wishes to determine its cost of common stock equity, rs. The
market price, P0, of its common stock is $50 per share. The firm expects to pay a
dividend, D1, of $4 at the end of the coming year, 2013. The dividends paid on the
outstanding stock over the past 6 years (2007 through 2012) were as follows:

Using a financial calculator or electronic spreadsheet, in conjunction with the tech-
nique described for finding growth rates in Chapter 5, we can calculate the annual
rate at which dividends have grown, g, from 2007 to 2012. It turns out to be
approximately 5% (more precisely, it is 5.05%). Substituting 
and 
into Equation 9.5 yields the cost of common stock equity:
The 13.0% cost of common stock equity represents the return required by
existing shareholders on their investment. If the actual return is less than that,
shareholders are likely to begin selling their stock.
Using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
Recall from Chapter 8 that the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) describes the
relationship between the required return, rs, and the nondiversifiable risk of the
firm as measured by the beta coefficient, b. The basic CAPM is:
(9.6)
where
 rm = market return; return on the market portfolio of assets
 RF = risk-free rate of return
rs = RF + 3b * (rm - RF)4
rs = $4
$50 + 0.05 = 0.08 + 0.05 = 0.130 or 13.0%
g = 5%
D1 = $4, P0 = $50,
capital asset pricing model
(CAPM)
Describes the relationship
between the required return, rs,
and the nondiversifiable risk of
the firm as measured by the
beta coefficient, b.

Using the CAPM indicates that the cost of common stock equity is the return
required by investors as compensation for the firm’s nondiversifiable risk, meas-
ured by beta.
Duchess Corporation now wishes to calculate its cost of common stock equity, rs,
by using the CAPM. The firm’s investment advisors and its own analysts indicate
that the risk-free rate, RF, equals 7%; the firm’s beta, b, equals 1.5; and the
market return, rm, equals 11%. Substituting these values into Equation 9.6, the
company estimates the cost of common stock equity, rs, to be:
The 13.0% cost of common stock equity represents the required return of
investors in Duchess Corporation common stock. It is the same as that found by
using the constant-growth valuation model.
Comparing Constant-Growth and CAPM Techniques
The CAPM technique differs from the constant-growth valuation model in that it
directly considers the firm’s risk, as reflected by beta, in determining the required
return or cost of common stock equity. The constant-growth model does not look
at risk; it uses the market price, P0, as a reflection of the expected risk–return
preference of investors in the marketplace. The constant-growth valuation and
CAPM techniques for finding rs are theoretically equivalent, though in practice
estimates from the two methods do not always agree. The two methods can pro-
duce different estimates because they require (as inputs) estimates of other quan-
tities, such as the expected dividend growth rate or the firm’s beta.
Another difference is that when the constant-growth valuation model is used to
find the cost of common stock equity, it can easily be adjusted for flotation costs to
find the cost of new common stock; the CAPM does not provide a simple adjust-
ment mechanism. The difficulty in adjusting the cost of common stock equity cal-
culated by using the CAPM occurs because in its common form the model does not
include the market price, P0, a variable needed to make such an adjustment.
Although the CAPM has a stronger theoretical foundation, the computational
appeal of the traditional constant-growth valuation model justifies its use
throughout this text to measure financing costs of common stock. As a practical
matter, analysts might want to estimate the cost of equity using both approaches and
then take an average of the results to arrive at a final estimate of the cost of equity.
COST OF RETAINED EARNINGS
As you know, dividends are paid out of a firm’s earnings. Their payment, made in
cash to common stockholders, reduces the firm’s retained earnings. Suppose a
firm needs common stock equity financing of a certain amount. It has two
choices relative to retained earnings: It can issue additional common stock in that
amount and still pay dividends to stockholders out of retained earnings, or it can
increase common stock equity by retaining the earnings (not paying the cash divi-
dends) in the needed amount. In a strict accounting sense, the retention of earnings
increases common stock equity in the same way that the sale of additional shares of
common stock does. Thus the cost of retained earnings, rr, to the firm is the same
as the cost of an equivalent fully subscribed issue of additional common stock.
rs = 7.0% + 31.5 * (11.0% - 7.0%)4 = 7.0% + 6.0% = 13.0%
Example 9.9 3
CHAPTER 9
The Cost of Capital
367
cost of retained earnings, rr
The same as the cost of an
equivalent fully subscribed
issue of additional common
stock, which is equal to the cost
of common stock equity, rs.

Stockholders find the firm’s retention of earnings acceptable only if they expect
that it will earn at least their required return on the reinvested funds.
Viewing retained earnings as a fully subscribed issue of additional common
stock, we can set the firm’s cost of retained earnings, rr, equal to the cost of
common stock equity as given by Equations 9.5 and 9.6.
(9.7)
It is not necessary to adjust the cost of retained earnings for flotation costs because
by retaining earnings the firm “raises” equity capital without incurring these costs.
The cost of retained earnings for Duchess Corporation was actually calculated in
the preceding examples: It is equal to the cost of common stock equity. Thus rr
equals 13.0%. As we will show in the next section, the cost of retained earnings
is always lower than the cost of a new issue of common stock because it entails
no flotation costs.

rr = rs

PART 4
Risk and the Required Rate of Return
Matter of fact
I
n the United States and most other countries, firms rely more heavily on retained earnings than any
other financing source. For example, a 2010 survey of CEOs by the Australian Industry Group
and Deloitte reported that the vast majority of Australian firms see retained earnings as their most
important source of finance. Almost 65% of CEOs surveyed said that retained earnings was their
most preferred source of financing, with bank debt coming in as a distant second choice.2
Retained Earnings, the Preferred Source of Financing
COST OF NEW ISSUES OF COMMON STOCK
Our purpose in finding the firm’s overall cost of capital is to determine the after-
tax cost of new funds required for financing projects. The cost of a new issue of
common stock, rn, is determined by calculating the cost of common stock, net of
underpricing and associated flotation costs. Normally, when new shares are issued
they are underpriced—sold at a discount relative to the current market price, P0.
Underpricing is the difference between the market price and the issue price, which
is the price paid by the primary market investors discussed in Chapter 2.
We can use the constant-growth valuation model expression for the cost of
existing common stock, rs, as a starting point. If we let Nn represent the net pro-
ceeds from the sale of new common stock after subtracting underpricing and
flotation costs, the cost of the new issue, rn, can be expressed as follows:3
(9.8)
rn = D1
Nn
+ g

3. An alternative, but computationally less straightforward, form of this equation is
(9.8a)
where f represents the percentage reduction in current market price expected as a result of underpricing and flota-
tion costs. Simply stated, Nn in Equation 9.8 is equivalent to 
in Equation 9.8a. For convenience,
Equation 9.8 is used to define the cost of a new issue of common stock, rn.

Stock sold at a price below its
current market price, P0.

The net proceeds from sale of new common stock, Nn, will be less than the
current market price, P0. Therefore, the cost of new issues, rn, will always be
greater than the cost of existing issues, rs, which is equal to the cost of retained
earnings, rr. The cost of new common stock is normally greater than any other
long-term financing cost.
In the constant-growth valuation example, we found Duchess Corporation’s cost
of common stock equity, rs, to be 13%, using the following values: an expected
dividend, D1, of $4; a current market price, P0, of $50; and an expected growth
rate of dividends, g, of 5%.
To determine its cost of new common stock, rn, Duchess Corporation has
estimated that on average, new shares can be sold for $47. The $3-per-share
underpricing is due to the competitive nature of the market. A second cost asso-
ciated with a new issue is flotation costs of $2.50 per share that would be paid to
issue and sell the new shares. The total underpricing and flotation costs per share
are therefore $5.50.
Subtracting the $5.50-per-share underpricing and flotation cost from the cur-
rent $50 share price results in expected net proceeds of $44.50 per share ($50.00
minus $5.50). Substituting 
and 
into Equation 9.8
results in a cost of new common stock, rn, as follows:
Duchess Corporation’s cost of new common stock is therefore 14.0%. This is the
value to be used in subsequent calculations of the firm’s overall cost of capital.

9.5 Weighted Average Cost of Capital
Now that we have calculated the cost of specific sources of financing, we can
determine the overall cost of capital. As noted earlier, the weighted average cost
of capital (WACC), ra, reflects the expected average future cost of capital over the
long run. It is found by weighting the cost of each specific type of capital by its
proportion in the firm’s capital structure.
CALCULATING WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL (WACC)
Calculating the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is straightforward:
Multiply the individual cost of each form of financing by its proportion in the

firm’s capital structure and sum the weighted values. As an equation, the weighted
average cost of capital, ra, can be specified as follows:
(9.9)
where
Three important points should be noted in Equation 9.9:
1. For computational convenience, it is best to convert the weights into decimal
form and leave the individual costs in percentage terms.
2. The weights must be nonnegative and sum to 1.0. Simply stated, WACC
must account for all financing costs within the firm’s capital structure.
3. The firm’s common stock equity weight, ws, is multiplied by either the cost of
retained earnings, rr, or the cost of new common stock, rn. Which cost is used
depends on whether the firm’s common stock equity will be financed using
retained earnings, rr, or new common stock, rn.
In earlier examples, we found the costs of the various types of capital for Duchess
Corporation to be as follows:
The company uses the following weights in calculating its weighted average cost
of capital:
 Cost of new common stock, rn = 14.0%
 Cost of retained earnings, rr = 13.0%
 Cost of preferred stock, rp = 10.6%
 Cost of debt, ri = 5.6%
Example 9.12 3
 wi + wp + ws = 1.0
 ws = proportion of common stock equity in capital structure
 wp = proportion of preferred stock in capital structure
 wi = proportion of long-term debt in capital structure
ra = (wi * ri) + (wp * rp) + (ws * rr or n)

Because the firm expects to have a sizable amount of retained earnings avail-

common stock equity. Duchess Corporation’s weighted average cost of capital is
calculated in Table 9.1. The resulting weighted average cost of capital for
Duchess is 9.8%. Assuming an unchanged risk level, the firm should accept all
projects that will earn a return greater than 9.8%.

saying.a
Part of Caraustar’s motivation for
implementing this two-pronged
approach was to account for the exces-
sively large spread between short- and
long-term debt rates that emerged dur-
ing the financial market crisis. Mr.
Domanico reported that during the cri-
sis Caraustar could borrow short-term
funds at the lower of Prime plus 4 per-
cent or LIBOR plus 5 percent—where
either rate was reasonable for making
short-term investment decisions.
Alternatively, long-term investment deci-
sions were being required to clear

inaccessible, and the great recession
saw Treasury bond yields fall to historic
lows, making cost of equity projections
appear unreasonably low. With these
key components in flux, it is exceedingly
difficult, if not impossible, for firms to 
get a handle on a cost of long-term 
capital.
According to CFO Magazine, at
least one firm resorted to a two-
pronged approach for determining its
cost of capital during the uncertain
times. Ron Domanico is the chief finan-
cial officer (CFO) at Caraustar
Industries, Inc., and he reported that his
company dealt with the cost-of-capital
uncertainty by abandoning the conven-
tional one-size-fits-all approach. “In the
past, we had one cost of capital that
we applied to all our investment deci-
sions . . . today that’s not the case. We
have a short-term cost of capital we
apply to short-term opportunities, and a
longer-term cost of capital we apply to
longer-term opportunities . . . and the
reality is that the longer-term cost is so
high that it has forced us to focus only
As U.S. financial mar-
kets experienced and
recovered from the 2008 financial 
crisis and 2009 “great recession,”
firms struggled to keep track of their
weighted average cost of capital. 
The individual component costs were
moving rapidly in response to the
financial market turmoil. Volatile finan-
cial markets can make otherwise man-
ageable cost-of-capital calculations 
exceedingly complex and inherently
error prone—possibly wreaking 
havoc with investment decisions. If a
firm underestimates its cost of capital 
it risks making investments that are 
not economically justified, and if a 
firm overestimates its financing costs it
risks foregoing value-maximizing 
investments.
Although the WACC computation
does not change when markets
become unstable, the uncertainty sur-
rounding the components that comprise
the WACC increases dramatically. The
financial crisis pushed credit costs to a
point where long-term debt was largely

WEIGHTING SCHEMES
Firms can calculate weights on the basis of either book value or market value
using either historical or target proportions.
Book Value versus Market Value
Book value weights use accounting values to measure the proportion of each type of
capital in the firm’s financial structure. Market value weights measure the propor-
tion of each type of capital at its market value. Market value weights are appealing
because the market values of securities closely approximate the actual dollars to be
received from their sale. Moreover, because firms calculate the costs of the various
types of capital by using prevailing market prices, it seems reasonable to use market
value weights. In addition, the long-term investment cash flows to which the cost of
capital is applied are estimated in terms of current as well as future market values.
Market value weights are clearly preferred over book value weights.
Historical versus Target
Historical weights can be either book or market value weights based on actual
capital structure proportions. For example, past or current book value propor-
tions would constitute a form of historical weighting, as would past or current
market value proportions. Such a weighting scheme would therefore be based on
real—rather than desired—proportions.
Target weights, which can also be based on either book or market values,
reflect the firm’s desired capital structure proportions. Firms using target weights
establish such proportions on the basis of the “optimal” capital structure they
wish to achieve. (The development of these proportions and the optimal structure
are discussed in detail in Chapter 13.)
When one considers the somewhat approximate nature of the calculation of
weighted average cost of capital, the choice of weights may not be critical.
However, from a strictly theoretical point of view, the preferred weighting scheme
is target market value proportions, and we assume these throughout this chapter.

Summary
FOCUS ON VALUE
The cost of capital is an extremely important rate of return, particularly in cap-
ital budgeting decisions. It is the expected average future cost to the firm of
funds over the long run. Because the cost of capital is the pivotal rate of return
used in the investment decision process, its accuracy can significantly affect the
quality of these decisions.
Underestimation of the cost of capital can make poor projects look attractive;
overestimation can make good projects look unattractive. By applying the tech-
niques presented in this chapter to estimate the firm’s cost of capital, the financial
manager will improve the likelihood that the firm’s long-term decisions will be
consistent with the firm’s overall goal of maximizing stock price (owner wealth).
REVIEW OF LEARNING GOALS
Understand the basic concept and sources of capital associated with the
cost of capital. The cost of capital is the minimum rate of return that a firm must
earn on its investments to grow firm value. A weighted average cost of capital
should be used to find the expected average future cost of funds over the long
run. The individual costs of the basic sources of capital (long-term debt, pre-
ferred stock, retained earnings, and common stock) can be calculated separately.
Explain what is meant by the marginal cost of capital. The relevant cost
of capital for a firm is the marginal cost of capital necessary to raise the next

marginal dollar of financing to fund the firm’s future investment opportunities.
A firm’s future investment opportunities in expectation will be required to
exceed the firm’s cost of capital.
Determine the cost of long-term debt, and explain why the after-tax cost
of debt is the relevant cost of debt. The before-tax cost of long-term debt can be
found by using cost quotations, calculations (either by calculator or spread-
sheet), or an approximation. The after-tax cost of debt is calculated by multi-
plying the before-tax cost of debt by 1 minus the tax rate. The after-tax cost of
debt is the relevant cost of debt because it is the lowest possible cost of debt for
the firm due to the deductibility of interest expenses.
Determine the cost of preferred stock. The cost of preferred stock is the
ratio of the preferred stock dividend to the firm’s net proceeds from the sale of
preferred stock.
Calculate the cost of common stock equity, and convert it into the cost
of retained earnings and the cost of new issues of common stock. The cost of
common stock equity can be calculated by using the constant-growth valuation
(Gordon growth) model or the CAPM. The cost of retained earnings is equal to
the cost of common stock equity. An adjustment in the cost of common stock
equity to reflect underpricing and flotation costs is necessary to find the cost of
new issues of common stock.
Calculate the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), and discuss
alternative weighting schemes. The firm’s WACC reflects the expected average
future cost of funds over the long run. It combines the costs of specific types of
capital after weighting each of them by its proportion. The theoretically pre-
ferred approach uses target weights based on market values.

$100,000. The family is in the 28% federal income tax bracket. There are two
choices for the Stark family: They can borrow the money from the boat dealer at an
annual interest rate of 8%, or they could take out a $100,000 second mortgage on
their home. Currently, home equity loans are at rates of 9.2%. There is no problem
securing either of these two alternative financing choices.
Rick and Stacy learn that if they borrow from the boat dealership, the interest
will not be tax deductible. However, the interest on the second mortgage will qualify
as being tax deductible on their federal income tax return.

Dillon Labs has asked its financial
manager to measure the cost of each specific type of capital as well as the weighted
average cost of capital. The weighted average cost is to be measured by using the fol-
lowing weights: 40% long-term debt, 10% preferred stock, and 50% common stock
equity (retained earnings, new common stock, or both). The firm’s tax rate is 40%.
Debt
The firm can sell for $980 a 10-year, $1,000-par-value bond paying
annual interest at a 10% coupon rate. A flotation cost of 3% of the par value is
required in addition to the discount of $20 per bond.
Preferred stock
Eight percent (annual dividend) preferred stock having a par
value of $100 can be sold for $65. An additional fee of $2 per share must be
paid to the underwriters.
Common stock
The firm’s common stock is currently selling for $50 per share.
The dividend expected to be paid at the end of the coming year (2013) is $4. Its
dividend payments, which have been approximately 60% of earnings per share
in each of the past 5 years, were as shown in the following table.

Debt
The firm can raise debt by selling $1,000-par-value, 8% coupon interest
rate, 20-year bonds on which annual interest payments will be made. To sell the
issue, an average discount of $30 per bond would have to be given. The firm also
must pay flotation costs of $30 per bond.
Preferred stock
The firm can sell 8% preferred stock at its $95-per-share par
value. The cost of issuing and selling the preferred stock is expected to be $5 per
share. Preferred stock can be sold under these terms.
Common stock
The firm’s common stock is currently selling for $90 per share.
The firm expects to pay cash dividends of $7 per share next year. The firm’s divi-
dends have been growing at an annual rate of 6%, and this growth is expected to
continue into the future. The stock must be underpriced by $7 per share, and
flotation costs are expected to amount to $5 per share. The firm can sell new
common stock under these terms.

During the 1990s, General Electric put together a long string
of consecutive quarters in which the firm managed to meet or beat the earnings fore-
casts of Wall Street stock analysts. Some skeptics wondered if GE “managed” earn-

to conceal the true volatility in its business. How do you think GE’s long run of
meeting or beating earnings forecasts affected its cost of capital? If investors learn
that GE’s performance was achieved largely through accounting gimmicks, how do
you think they would respond?

Nova Corporation is interested in measuring the cost of each specific type of capital
as well as the weighted average cost of capital. Historically, the firm has raised capital
in the following manner:
LG 6
LG 1

The tax rate of the firm is currently 40%. The needed financial information and
data are as follows:
Debt
Nova can raise debt by selling $1,000-par-value, 6.5% coupon interest
rate, 10-year bonds on which annual interest payments will be made. To sell the
issue, an average discount of $20 per bond needs to be given. There is an associ-
ated flotation cost of 2% of par value.
Preferred stock
Preferred stock can be sold under the following terms: The
security has a par value of $100 per share, the annual dividend rate is 6% of the
par value, and the flotation cost is expected to be $4 per share. The preferred
stock is expected to sell for $102 before cost considerations.
Common stock
The current price of Nova’s common stock is $35 per share.
The cash dividend is expected to be $3.25 per share next year. The firm’s divi-
dends have grown at an annual rate of 5%, and it is expected that the dividend
will continue at this rate for the foreseeable future. The flotation costs are
expected to be approximately $2 per share. Nova can sell new common stock
under these terms.
Retained earnings
The firm expects to have available $100,000 of retained
earnings in the coming year. Once these retained earnings are exhausted, the firm
will use new common stock as the form of common stock equity financing.
(Note: When measuring this cost, the firm does not concern itself with the tax
bracket or brokerage fees of owners.)
TO DO
Create a spreadsheet to answer the following questions:
a. Calculate the after-tax cost of debt.
b. Calculate the cost of preferred stock.
c. Calculate the cost of retained earnings.
d. Calculate the cost of new common stock.
e. Calculate the firm’s weighted average cost of capital using retained earnings and

Eco Plastics Company
S
ince its inception, Eco Plastics Company has been revolutionizing plastic and trying
to do its part to save the environment. Eco’s founder, Marion Cosby, developed a
biodegradable plastic that her company is marketing to manufacturing companies
throughout the southeastern United States. After operating as a private company for
six years, Eco went public in 2009 and is listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange.
As the chief financial officer of a young company with lots of investment oppor-
tunities, Eco’s CFO closely monitors the firm’s cost of capital. The CFO keeps tabs
on each of the individual costs of Eco’s three main financing sources: long-term debt,
preferred stock, and common stock. The target capital structure for ECO is given by
the weights in the following table:
Source of capital

Common stock equity
Total
%

50
At the present time, Eco can raise debt by selling 20-year bonds with a $1,000
par value and a 10.5% annual coupon interest rate. Eco’s corporate tax rate is 40%,
and its bonds generally require an average discount of $45 per bond and flotation
costs of $32 per bond when being sold. Eco’s outstanding preferred stock pays a 9%
dividend and has a $95-per-share par value. The cost of issuing and selling addi-
tional preferred stock is expected to be $7 per share. Because Eco is a young firm
that requires lots of cash to grow it does not currently pay a dividend to common
stock holders. To track the cost of common stock the CFO uses the capital asset
pricing model (CAPM). The CFO and the firm’s investment advisors believe that the
appropriate risk-free rate is 4% and that the market’s expected return equals 13%.
Using data from 2009 through 2012, Eco’s CFO estimates the firm’s beta to be 1.3.
Although Eco’s current target capital structure includes 20% preferred stock,
the company is considering using debt financing to retire the outstanding preferred
stock, thus shifting their target capital structure to 50% long-term debt and 50%
common stock. If Eco shifts its capital mix from preferred stock to debt, its financial
advisors expect its beta to increase to 1.5.
TO DO
a. Calculate Eco’s current after-tax cost of long-term debt.
b. Calculate Eco’s current cost of preferred stock.
c. Calculate Eco’s current cost of common stock.
d. Calculate Eco’s current weighted average cost capital.
e. (1) Assuming that the debt financing costs do not change, what effect would a
shift to a more highly leveraged capital structure consisting of 50% long-term
debt, 0% preferred stock, and 50% common stock have on the risk premium
for Eco’s common stock? What would be Eco’s new cost of common equity?
(2) What would be Eco’s new weighted average cost of capital?
(3) Which capital structure—the original one or this one—seems better? Why?

Risk and Refinements in Capital Budgeting
INTEGRATIVE CASE 5 Lasting Impressions Company
P
robably nothing that financial managers do is more important to the long-term
success of a company than making good investment decisions. The term capital
budgeting describes the process for evaluating and selecting investment projects.
Often, capital expenditures can be very large, such as building a new plant or
launching a new product line. These endeavors can create enormous value for
shareholders, but they can also bankrupt the company. In this section, you’ll learn 
how financial managers decide which investment opportunities to pursue.
Chapter 10 covers the capital budgeting tools that financial managers and analysts
use to evaluate the merits of an investment. Some of these techniques are quite intuitive
and simple to use, such as payback analysis. Other techniques are a little more
complex, such as the NPV and IRR approaches. In general, the more complex
techniques provide more comprehensive evaluations, however, the simpler approaches
often lead to the same value-maximizing decisions.
Chapter 11 illustrates how to develop the capital budgeting cash flows that the
techniques covered in Chapter 10 require. After studying this chapter, you will
understand the inputs that are necessary to build the relevant cash flows that are
required to determine whether a particular investment is likely to create or destroy 
value for shareholders.
Chapter 12 introduces additional techniques for evaluating the risks inherent with
capital investment projects. Because of the often huge scale of capital investments and
their importance to the firm’s financial well-being, managers invest a tremendous
amount of time and energy trying to understand the risks associated with these
projects.

Why This Chapter Matters to You
In your professional life
ACCOUNTING You need to understand capital budgeting techniques
to help determine the relevant cash flows associated with proposed
capital expenditures.
INFORMATION SYSTEMS You need to understand capital budgeting
techniques to design decision modules that help reduce the amount of
work required to analyze proposed capital expenditures.
MANAGEMENT You need to understand capital budgeting techniques
to correctly analyze the relevant cash flows of proposed projects and
decide whether to accept or reject them.
MARKETING You need to understand capital budgeting techniques to
grasp how proposals for new marketing programs, for new products,
and for the expansion of existing product lines will be evaluated by the
firm’s decision makers.
OPERATIONS You need to understand capital budgeting techniques to
know how proposals for the acquisition of new equipment and plants
will be evaluated by the firm’s decision makers.
You can use the capital budgeting
techniques used by financial man-
agers to measure either the value of a given asset purchase or its com-
pound rate of return. The IRR technique is widely applied in personal
finance to measure both actual and forecast rate of returns on invest-
ment securities, real estate, credit card debt, consumer loans, 
and leases.

The Gold Standard for Evaluating 
Gold Mines
G
enco Resources, a Canadian mining firm,
announced the results of a feasibility study evalu-
ating expansion of the firm’s operations in Mexico.
Specifically, the study examined the merits of opening
a new cyanide leach plant that would allow the firm to
increase its production by a factor of ten. Cost of the
expansion included $149 million to build the plant,
including $40 million in working capital and contingencies required to begin operations.
The study estimated cash flows from this investment over its 9-year projected life, assuming
prices of silver and gold of $14 and $800 per ounce respectively. Based on those assumptions,
the study claimed that the expansion project would pay back the initial cost in 3.6 years, would
generate a 20 percent internal rate of return, and would produce a net present value of almost
$75 million.
Payback, internal rate of return, and net present value are all methods that companies use
to evaluate potential investment projects. Each of these techniques has advantages and disad-
vantages, but the net present value method has become the gold standard for analyzing invest-
ments. This chapter explains why.

Long-Term Investment Decisions
10.1 Overview of Capital Budgeting
Long-term investments represent sizable outlays of funds that commit a firm to
some course of action. Consequently, the firm needs procedures to analyze and
select its long-term investments. Capital budgeting is the process of evaluating and
selecting long-term investments that are consistent with the firm’s goal of maxi-
mizing owners’ wealth. Firms typically make a variety of long-term investments,
but the most common is in fixed assets, which include property (land), plant, and
equipment. These assets, often referred to as earning assets, generally provide the
basis for the firm’s earning power and value.
Because firms treat capital budgeting (investment) and financing decisions
separately, Chapters 10 through 12 concentrate on fixed-asset acquisition
without regard to the specific method of financing used. We begin by discussing
the motives for capital expenditure.
MOTIVES FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
A capital expenditure is an outlay of funds by the firm that is expected to produce
benefits over a period of time greater than 1 year. An operating expenditure is an
outlay resulting in benefits received within 1 year. Fixed-asset outlays are capital
expenditures, but not all capital expenditures are classified as fixed assets. A
$60,000 outlay for a new machine with a usable life of 15 years is a capital
expenditure that would appear as a fixed asset on the firm’s balance sheet. A
$60,000 outlay for an advertising campaign that is expected to produce benefits
over a long period is also a capital expenditure but would rarely be shown as a
fixed asset.
Companies make capital expenditures for many reasons. The basic motives for
capital expenditures are to expand operations, to replace or renew fixed assets, or
to obtain some other, less tangible benefit over a long period.
STEPS IN THE PROCESS
The capital budgeting process consists of five distinct but interrelated steps:
1. Proposal generation. Proposals for new investment projects are made at all
levels within a business organization and are reviewed by finance personnel.
Proposals that require large outlays are more carefully scrutinized than less
costly ones.
2. Review and analysis. Financial managers perform formal review and analysis
to assess the merits of investment proposals.
3. Decision making. Firms typically delegate capital expenditure decision
making on the basis of dollar limits. Generally, the board of directors must
authorize expenditures beyond a certain amount. Often plant managers are
given authority to make decisions necessary to keep the production line
moving.
4. Implementation. Following approval, expenditures are made and projects
implemented. Expenditures for a large project often occur in phases.
5. Follow-up. Results are monitored, and actual costs and benefits are com-
pared with those that were expected. Action may be required if actual out-
comes differ from projected ones.

Five distinct but interrelated

Each step in the process is important. Review and analysis and decision
making (Steps 2 and 3) consume the majority of time and effort, however.
Follow-up (Step 5) is an important but often ignored step aimed at allowing the
firm to improve the accuracy of its cash flow estimates continuously. Because of
their fundamental importance, this and the following chapters give primary con-
sideration to review and analysis and to decision making.
BASIC TERMINOLOGY
Before we develop the concepts, techniques, and practices related to the capital
budgeting process, we need to explain some basic terminology. In addition, we
will present some key assumptions that are used to simplify the discussion in the
remainder of this chapter and in Chapters 11 and 12.
Independent versus Mutually Exclusive Projects
Most investments can be placed into one of two categories: (1) independent proj-
ects or (2) mutually exclusive projects. Independent projects are those whose cash
flows are unrelated to (or independent of) one another; the acceptance of one
project does not eliminate the others from further consideration. Mutually exclu-
sive projects are those that have the same function and therefore compete with one
another. The acceptance of one eliminates from further consideration all other
projects that serve a similar function. For example, a firm in need of increased pro-
duction capacity could obtain it by (1) expanding its plant, (2) acquiring another
company, or (3) contracting with another company for production. Clearly,
accepting any one option eliminates the immediate need for either of the others.
Unlimited Funds versus Capital Rationing
The availability of funds for capital expenditures affects the firm’s decisions. If a
firm has unlimited funds for investment (or if it can raise as much money as it
needs by borrowing or issuing stock), making capital budgeting decisions is quite
simple: All independent projects that will provide an acceptable return can be
accepted. Typically, though, firms operate under capital rationing instead. This
means that they have only a fixed number of dollars available for capital expen-
ditures and that numerous projects will compete for these dollars. Procedures for
dealing with capital rationing are presented in Chapter 12. The discussions here
and in the following chapter assume unlimited funds.
Accept–Reject versus Ranking Approaches
Two basic approaches to capital budgeting decisions are available. The accept–reject
approach involves evaluating capital expenditure proposals to determine whether
they meet the firm’s minimum acceptance criterion. This approach can be used
when the firm has unlimited funds, as a preliminary step when evaluating mutu-
ally exclusive projects, or in a situation in which capital must be rationed. In
these cases, only acceptable projects should be considered.
The second method, the ranking approach, involves ranking projects on the
basis of some predetermined measure, such as the rate of return. The project with
the highest return is ranked first, and the project with the lowest return is ranked
last. Only acceptable projects should be ranked. Ranking is useful in selecting the
“best” of a group of mutually exclusive projects and in evaluating projects with a
view of capital rationing.

CAPITAL BUDGETING TECHNIQUES
Large firms evaluate dozens, perhaps even hundreds, of different ideas for new
investments each year. To ensure that the investment projects selected have the
best chance of increasing the value of the firm, financial managers need tools to
help them evaluate the merits of individual projects and to rank competing
investments. A number of techniques are available for performing such analyses.
The preferred approaches integrate time value procedures, risk and return con-
siderations, and valuation concepts to select capital expenditures that are consis-
tent with the firm’s goal of maximizing owners’ wealth. This chapter focuses on
the use of these techniques in an environment of certainty.
Bennett Company’s Relevant Cash Flows
We will use one basic problem to illustrate all the techniques described in this
chapter. The problem concerns Bennett Company, a medium-sized metal fabri-
cator that is currently contemplating two projects: Project A requires an initial
investment of $42,000; project B requires an initial investment of $45,000. The
projected relevant cash flows for the two projects are presented in Table 10.1 and
depicted on the time lines in Figure 10.1. Both projects involve one initial cash

niques: payback period, net present value, and internal rate of return.

10.2 Payback Period
Payback periods are commonly used to evaluate proposed investments. The
payback period is the amount of time required for the firm to recover its initial
investment in a project, as calculated from cash inflows. In the case of an annuity
(such as the Bennett Company’s project A), the payback period can be found by
dividing the initial investment by the annual cash inflow. For a mixed stream of
cash inflows (such as project B), the yearly cash inflows must be accumulated
until the initial investment is recovered. Although popular, the payback period is
generally viewed as an unsophisticated capital budgeting technique, because it
does not explicitly consider the time value of money.
DECISION CRITERIA
When the payback period is used to make accept–reject decisions, the following
decision criteria apply:
• If the payback period is less than the maximum acceptable payback period,
accept the project.
• If the payback period is greater than the maximum acceptable payback
period, reject the project.
The length of the maximum acceptable payback period is determined by manage-
ment. This value is set subjectively on the basis of a number of factors, including
the type of project (expansion, replacement or renewal, other), the perceived risk
of the project, and the perceived relationship between the payback period and the
share value. It is simply a value that management feels, on average, will result in
value-creating investment decisions.
We can calculate the payback period for Bennett Company’s projects A and B
using the data in Table 10.1. For project A, which is an annuity, the payback
period is 3.0 years ($42,000 initial investment
$14,000 annual cash inflow).
Because project B generates a mixed stream of cash inflows, the calculation of its
payback period is not as clear-cut. In year 1, the firm will recover $28,000 of its
$45,000 initial investment. By the end of year 2, $40,000 ($28,000 from year
1
$12,000 from year 2) will have been recovered. At the end of year 3,
$50,000 will have been recovered. Only 50% of the year-3 cash inflow of
$10,000 is needed to complete the payback of the initial $45,000. The payback
period for project B is therefore 2.5 years (2 years
50% of year 3).

for a firm to recover its initial

If Bennett’s maximum acceptable payback period were 2.75 years, project A
would be rejected and project B would be accepted. If the maximum acceptable pay-
back period were 2.25 years, both projects would be rejected. If the projects were
being ranked, B would be preferred over A because it has a shorter payback period.
PROS AND CONS OF PAYBACK ANALYSIS
Large firms sometimes use the payback approach to evaluate small projects, and
small firms use it to evaluate most projects. Its popularity results from its computa-
tional simplicity and intuitive appeal. By measuring how quickly the firm recovers
its initial investment, the payback period also gives implicit consideration to the
timing of cash flows and therefore to the time value of money. Because it can be
viewed as a measure of risk exposure, many firms use the payback period as a deci-
sion criterion or as a supplement to other decision techniques. The longer the firm
must wait to recover its invested funds, the greater the possibility of a calamity.
Hence, the shorter the payback period the lower the firm’s risk exposure.
The major weakness of the payback period is that the appropriate payback
period is merely a subjectively determined number. It cannot be specified in light
of the wealth maximization goal because it is not based on discounting cash flows
to determine whether they add to the firm’s value. Instead, the appropriate pay-
back period is simply the maximum acceptable period of time over which man-
agement decides that a project’s cash flows must break even (that is, just equal to
the initial investment). The Focus on Practice box offers more information about
these time limits in actual practice.
Seema Mehdi is considering investing $20,000 to obtain a 5%
interest in a rental property. Her good friend and real estate agent,
Akbar Ahmed, put the deal together and he conservatively estimates that Seema
should receive between $4,000 and $6,000 per year in cash from her 5% interest in
the property. The deal is structured in a way that forces all investors to maintain
their investment in the property for at least 10 years. Seema expects to remain in the
25% income-tax bracket for quite a while. To be acceptable, Seema requires the
investment to pay itself back in terms of after-tax cash flows in less than 7 years.
Seema’s calculation of the payback period on this deal begins with calcula-
tion of the range of annual after-tax cash flow:
The after-tax cash flow ranges from $3,000 to $4,500. Dividing the $20,000 ini-
tial investment by each of the estimated after-tax cash flows, we get the payback
period:
Because Seema’s proposed rental property investment will pay itself back between
4.44 and 6.67 years, which is a range below her maximum payback of 7 years,
the investment is acceptable.
= $20,000 , $4,500 = 4.44 years
= $20,000 , $3,000 = 6.67 years
Payback period = Initial investment , After-tax cash flow
= (1 - 0.25) * $6,000 = $4,500
= (1 - 0.25) * $4,000 = $3,000
After-tax cash flow = (1 - tax rate) * Pre-tax cash flow

A second weakness is that this approach fails to take fully into account the
time factor in the value of money.1 This weakness can be illustrated by an
example.
DeYarman Enterprises, a small medical appliance manufacturer, is considering
two mutually exclusive projects named Gold and Silver. The firm uses only the
payback period to choose projects. The cash flows and payback period for each
project are given in Table 10.2. Both projects have 3-year payback periods, which
would suggest that they are equally desirable. But comparison of the pattern of
cash inflows over the first 3 years shows that more of the $50,000 initial invest-
ment in project Silver is recovered sooner than is recovered for project Gold. For
example, in year 1, $40,000 of the $50,000 invested in project Silver is recovered,
whereas only $5,000 of the $50,000 investment in project Gold is recovered.
Given the time value of money, project Silver would clearly be preferred over

even more important than discounted
cash flow (NPV and IRR)—because it
spotlights the risks inherent in lengthy IT
projects. “It should be a hard and fast
rule to never take an IT project with a
payback period greater than 3 years,
unless it’s an infrastructure project you
can’t do without,” Campbell says.
Whatever the weaknesses of the
payback period method of evaluating
capital projects, the simplicity of the
method does allow it to be used in
conjunction with other, more sophisti-
cated measures. It can be used to
screen potential projects and winnow
them down to the few that merit more
careful scrutiny with, for example, net
present value (NPV).

in Barrington, Illinois. “The simplicity of
computing payback may encourage
sloppiness, especially the failure to
include all costs associated with an
investment, such as training, mainte-
nance, and hardware upgrade costs,”
says Douglas Emond, senior vice presi-
dent and chief technology officer at
Eastern Bank in Lynn, Massachusetts.
For example, he says, “you may be
bringing in a hot new technology, but
uh-oh, after implementation you realize
that you need a .Net guru in-house,
and you don’t have one.”
But the payback method’s emphasis
on the short term has a special appeal
for IT managers. “That’s because the
history of IT projects that take longer
than 3 years is disastrous,” says
Gardner. Indeed, Ian Campbell, chief
research officer at Nucleus Research,
Inc., in Wellesley, Massachusetts, says
payback period is an absolutely essen-
tial metric for evaluating IT projects—
In tough economic
times, the standard for
a payback period is often reduced.
Chief information officers (CIOs) are
apt to reject projects with payback 
periods of more than 2 years. “We
start with payback period,” says 
Ron Fijalkowski, CIO at Strategic
Distribution, Inc., in Bensalem,
Pennsylvania. “For sure, if the payback
period is over 36 months, it’s not going
to get approved. But our rule of thumb
is we’d like to see 24 months. And if
it’s close to 12, it’s probably a no-
brainer.”
While easy to compute and easy to
understand, the payback period’s sim-
plicity brings with it some drawbacks.
“Payback gives you an answer that tells
you a bit about the beginning stage of
a project, but it doesn’t tell you much
about the full lifetime of the project,”
says Chris Gardner, a cofounder of
iValue LLC, an IT valuation consultancy

1. To consider differences in timing explicitly in applying the payback method, the discounted payback period is
sometimes used. It is found by first calculating the present value of the cash inflows at the appropriate discount rate
and then finding the payback period by using the present value of the cash inflows.

project Gold, in spite of the fact that both have identical 3-year payback periods.
The payback approach does not fully account for the time value of money, which,
if recognized, would cause project Silver to be preferred over project Gold.
A third weakness of payback is its failure to recognize cash flows that occur
after the payback period.
Rashid Company, a software developer, has two investment opportunities, X and
Y. Data for X and Y are given in Table 10.3. The payback period for project X is
2 years; for project Y it is 3 years. Strict adherence to the payback approach sug-
gests that project X is preferable to project Y. However, if we look beyond the
payback period, we see that project X returns only an additional $1,200 ($1,000
in year 3
$100 in year 4
$100 in year 5), whereas project Y returns an addi-
tional $7,000 ($4,000 in year 4
$3,000 in year 5). On the basis of this infor-
mation, project Y appears preferable to X. The payback approach ignored the
cash inflows occurring after the end of the payback period.

period to evaluate a proposed investment?
CHAPTER 10
Capital Budgeting Techniques
397
10.3 Net Present Value (NPV)
The method used by most large companies to evaluate investment projects is
called net present value (NPV). The intuition behind the NPV method is simple.
When firms make investments, they are spending money that they obtained, in
one form or another, from investors. Investors expect a return on the money that
they give to firms, so a firm should undertake an investment only if the present
value of the cash flow that the investment generates is greater than the cost of
making the investment in the first place. Because the NPV method takes into
account the time value of investors’ money, it is a more sophisticated capital budg-
eting technique than the payback rule. The NPV method discounts the firm’s cash
flows at the firm’s cost of capital. This rate—as discussed in Chapter 9—is the
minimum return that must be earned on a project to satisfy the firm’s investors.
Projects with lower returns fail to meet investors’ expectations and therefore
decrease firm value, and projects with higher returns increase firm value.
The net present value (NPV) is found by subtracting a project’s initial invest-
ment (CF0) from the present value of its cash inflows (CFt) discounted at a rate
equal to the firm’s cost of capital (r).
(10.1)
When NPV is used, both inflows and outflows are measured in terms of present
dollars. For a project that has cash outflows beyond the initial investment, the net
present value of a project would be found by subtracting the present value of out-
flows from the present value of inflows.
DECISION CRITERIA
When NPV is used to make accept–reject decisions, the decision criteria are as
follows:
• If the NPV is greater than $0, accept the project.
• If the NPV is less than $0, reject the project.
If the NPV is greater than $0, the firm will earn a return greater than its cost of
capital. Such action should increase the market value of the firm, and therefore
the wealth of its owners by an amount equal to the NPV.
We can illustrate the net present value (NPV) approach by using the Bennett
Company data presented in Table 10.1. If the firm has a 10% cost of capital, the
net present values for projects A (an annuity) and B (a mixed stream) can be

calculated as shown on the time lines in Figure 10.2. These calculations result in
net present values for projects A and B of $11,071 and $10,924, respectively.
Both projects are acceptable, because the net present value of each is greater than
$0. If the projects were being ranked, however, project A would be considered
superior to B, because it has a higher net present value than that of B ($11,071
versus $10,924).
Calculator Use
The preprogrammed NPV function in a financial calculator can
be used to simplify the NPV calculation. The keystrokes for project A—the
annuity—typically are as shown at left. Note that because project A is an annuity,
only its first cash inflow, 
, is input, followed by its frequency, 
.
The keystrokes for project B—the mixed stream—are as shown on page 397.
Because the last three cash inflows for project B are the same 
, after inputting the first of these cash inflows, CF3, we merely input its
frequency, 
.
The calculated NPVs for projects A and B of $11,071 and $10,924, respec-
tively, agree with the NPVs already cited.
Spreadsheet Use
The NPVs can be calculated as shown on the following Excel

NPV AND THE PROFITABILITY INDEX
A variation of the NPV rule is called the profitability index (PI). For a project that
has an initial cash outflow followed by cash inflows, the profitability index (PI) is
simply equal to the present value of cash inflows divided by the initial cash 
outflow:2
(10.2)
When companies evaluate investment opportunities using the PI, the decision rule
they follow is to invest in the project when the index is greater than 1.0. When
the PI is greater than one, that implies that the present value of cash inflows is
greater than the (absolute value of the) initial cash outflow, so a profitability index
greater than one corresponds to a net present value greater than zero. In other
words, the NPV and PI methods will always come to the same conclusion regarding
whether a particular investment is worth doing or not.
We can refer back to Figure 10.2, which shows the present value of cash inflows
for projects A and B, to calculate the PI for each of Bennett’s investment options:
According to the profitability index, both projects are acceptable (because PI
1.0
for both), which shouldn’t be surprising because we already know that both projects

have positive NPVs. Furthermore, in this particular case, the NPV rule and the PI
both indicate that project A is preferred over project B. It is not always true that
the NPV and PI methods will rank projects in exactly the same order. Different
rankings can occur when alternative projects require initial outlays that have very
different magnitudes.
NPV AND ECONOMIC VALUE ADDED
Economic Value Added (or EVA), a registered trademark of the consulting firm
Stern Stewart & Co., is another close cousin of the NPV method. Whereas the
NPV approach calculates the value of an investment over its entire life, the EVA
approach is typically used to measure an investment’s performance on a year-by-
year basis. The EVA method begins the same way that NPV does—by calculating
a project’s net cash flows. However, the EVA approach subtracts from those cash
flows a charge that is designed to capture the return that the firm’s investors
demand on the project. That is, the EVA calculation asks whether a project gen-
erates positive cash flows above and beyond what investors demand. If so, then
the project is worth undertaking.
The EVA method determines whether a project earns a pure economic profit.
When accountants say that a firm has earned a profit, they mean that revenues
are greater than expenses. But the term pure economic profit refers to a profit
that is higher than expected given the competitive rate of return on a particular
line of business. A firm that shows a positive profit on its income statement may
or may not earn a pure economic profit, depending on how large the profit is rel-
ative to the capital invested in the business. For instance, in the first quarter of
2010, TomTom, the European maker of portable GPS devices, reported a net
profit of 
3 million. Does that seem like a large profit? Perhaps not when you
consider that TomTom’s balance sheet showed total assets of over 
2.5 billion.
In other words, TomTom’s profit represented a return of just 0.0012 percent on
the firm’s assets. That return was below the rate offered on risk-free government
securities in 2010, so it clearly fell below the expectations of TomTom’s investors
(who would have expected a higher return as compensation for the risks they were
taking), so the company earned a pure economic loss that quarter. Stated differ-
ently, TomTom’s EVA in the first quarter of 2010 was negative.
Suppose a certain project costs $1,000,000 up front, but after that it will generate
net cash inflows each year (in perpetuity) of $120,000. To calculate the NPV of
this project, we would simply discount the cash flows and add them up. If the
firm’s cost of capital is 10%, then the project’s NPV is:3
To calculate the investment’s economic value added in any particular year,
we start with the annual $120,000 cash flow. Next, we assign a charge that
accounts for the return that investors demand on the capital that the firm has
invested in the project. In this case, the firm invested $1,000,000, and investors
NPV = -$1,000,000 + ($120,000 , 0.10) = $200,000

expect a 10% return. That means that the project’s annual capital charge is $100,000
($1,000,000
10%), and its EVA is $20,000 per year:
In other words, this project earns more than its cost of capital each year, so the
project is clearly worth doing. To calculate the EVA for the project over its entire
life, we would simply discount the annual EVA figures using the firm’s cost of cap-
ital. In this case, the project produces an annual EVA of $20,000 in perpetuity.
Discounting this at 10% gives a project EVA of $200,000 ($20,000
0.10), iden-
tical to the NPV. In this example, both the NPV and EVA methods reach the same
conclusion, namely that the project creates $200,000 in value for shareholders. If
the cash flows in our example had fluctuated through time rather than remaining
fixed at $120,000 per year, an analyst would calculate the investment’s EVA
every year, then discount those figures to the present using the firm’s cost of cap-
ital. If the resulting figure is positive, then the project generates a positive EVA
and is worth doing.

10.4 Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
The internal rate of return (IRR) is one of the most widely used capital budgeting
techniques. The internal rate of return (IRR) is the discount rate that equates the
NPV of an investment opportunity with $0 (because the present value of cash
inflows equals the initial investment). It is the rate of return that the firm will earn if
it invests in the project and receives the given cash inflows. Mathematically, the IRR
is the value of r in Equation 10.1 that causes NPV to equal $0.
(10.3)
(10.3a)
DECISION CRITERIA
When IRR is used to make accept–reject decisions, the decision criteria are as
follows:
• If the IRR is greater than the cost of capital, accept the project.
• If the IRR is less than the cost of capital, reject the project.

internal rate of return (IRR)
The discount rate that equates 
the NPV of an investment
opportunity with $0 (because
the present value of cash
inflows equals the initial
investment); it is the rate of
return that the firm will earn if
it invests in the project and
receives the given cash inflows.

These criteria guarantee that the firm will earn at least its required return. Such
an outcome should increase the market value of the firm and, therefore, the
wealth of its owners.
CALCULATING THE IRR
Most financial calculators have a preprogrammed IRR function that can be used
to simplify the IRR calculation. With these calculators, you merely punch in all
cash flows just as if to calculate NPV and then depress IRR to find the internal rate
of return. Computer software, including spreadsheets, is also available for simpli-
fying these calculations. All NPV and IRR values presented in this and subsequent
chapters are obtained by using these functions on a popular financial calculator.
We can demonstrate the internal rate of return (IRR) approach by using the Bennett
Company data presented in Table 10.1. Figure 10.3 uses time lines to depict the
framework for finding the IRRs for Bennett’s projects A and B. We can see in the
figure that the IRR is the unknown discount rate that causes the NPV to equal $0.
Calculator Use
To find the IRR using the preprogrammed function in a finan-
cial calculator, the keystrokes for each project are the same as those shown on
pages 398 and 399 for the NPV calculation, except that the last two NPV key-
strokes (punching I and then NPV) are replaced by a single IRR keystroke.

It is interesting to note in the preceding Example 10.8 that the IRR suggests
that project B, which has an IRR of 21.7%, is preferable to project A, which
has an IRR of 19.9%. This conflicts with the NPV rankings obtained in an ear-
lier example. Such conflicts are not unusual. There is no guarantee that NPV
and IRR will rank projects in the same order. However, both methods should
reach the same conclusion about the acceptability or nonacceptability of
projects.
Tony DiLorenzo is evaluating an investment opportunity. He is
comfortable with the investment’s level of risk. Based on com-
peting investment opportunities, he feels that this investment must earn a min-
imum compound annual after-tax return of 9% to be acceptable. Tony’s initial
investment would be $7,500, and he expects to receive annual after-tax cash
flows of $500 per year in each of the first 4 years, followed by $700 per year at
the end of years 5 through 8. He plans to sell the investment at the end of year 8
and net $9,000, after taxes.
Personal Finance Example 10.9 3

To calculate the investment’s IRR (compound annual return), Tony first sum-
marizes the after-tax cash flows as shown in the following table:

ment is acceptable.

10.5 Comparing NPV and IRR Techniques
To understand the differences between the NPV and IRR techniques and decision
makers’ preferences in their use, we need to look at net present value profiles,
conflicting rankings, and the question of which approach is better.
NET PRESENT VALUE PROFILES
Projects can be compared graphically by constructing net present value profiles
that depict the project’s NPVs for various discount rates. These profiles are useful
in evaluating and comparing projects, especially when conflicting rankings exist.
They are best demonstrated via an example.
To prepare net present value profiles for Bennett Company’s two projects, A and B,
the first step is to develop a number of “discount rate–net present value” coordi-
nates. Three coordinates can be easily obtained for each project; they are at discount

rates of 0%, 10% (the cost of capital, r), and the IRR. The net present value at a
0% discount rate is found by merely adding all the cash inflows and subtracting
the initial investment. Using the data in Table 10.1 and Figure 10.1, we get
For project A:
For project B:
The net present values for projects A and B at the 10% cost of capital are
$11,071 and $10,924, respectively (from Figure 10.2). Because the IRR is the dis-
count rate for which net present value equals zero, the IRRs (from Figure 10.3) of
19.9% for project A and 21.7% for project B result in $0 NPVs. The three sets of
coordinates for each of the projects are summarized in Table 10.4.
Plotting the data from Table 10.4 results in the net present value profiles for
projects A and B shown in Figure 10.4. The figure reveals three important facts:
1. The IRR of project B is greater than the IRR of project A, so managers using
the IRR method to rank projects will always choose B over A if both projects
are acceptable.
($28,000 + $12,000 + $10,000 + $10,000 + $10,000) - $45,000 = $25,000
($14,000 + $14,000 + $14,000 + $14,000 + $14,000) - $42,000 = $28,000

2. The NPV of project A is sometimes higher and sometimes lower than the NPV
of project B; thus, the NPV method will not consistently rank A above B or
vice versa. The NPV ranking will depend on the firm’s cost of capital.
3. When the cost of capital is approximately 10.7%, projects A and B have iden-
tical NPVs.
The cost of capital for Bennett Company is 10%, and at that rate project A has a
higher NPV than project B (the red line is above the blue line in Figure 10.4 when
the discount rate is 10%). Therefore, the NPV and IRR methods rank the two
projects differently. If Bennett’s cost of capital were a little higher, say 12%, the
NPV method would rank project B over project A and there would be no conflict
in the rankings provided by the NPV and IRR approaches.
CONFLICTING RANKINGS
Ranking different investment opportunities is an important consideration when
projects are mutually exclusive or when capital rationing is necessary. When proj-
ects are mutually exclusive, ranking enables the firm to determine which project
is best from a financial standpoint. When capital rationing is necessary, ranking
projects will provide a logical starting point for determining which group of proj-
ects to accept. As we’ll see, conflicting rankings using NPV and IRR result from
differences in the reinvestment rate assumption, the timing of each project’s cash
flows, and the magnitude of the initial investment.
Reinvestment Assumption
One underlying cause of conflicting rankings is different implicit assumptions
about the reinvestment of intermediate cash inflows—cash inflows received prior
to the termination of a project. NPV assumes that intermediate cash inflows are
reinvested at the cost of capital, whereas IRR assumes that intermediate cash
inflows are reinvested at a rate equal to the project’s IRR.4 These differing
assumptions can be demonstrated with an example.
A project requiring a $170,000 initial investment is expected to provide operating
cash inflows of $52,000, $78,000, and $100,000 at the end of each of the next 
3 years. The NPV of the project (at the firm’s 10% cost of capital) is $16,867 and
its IRR is 15%. Clearly, the project is acceptable 
and
cost of capital). Table 10.5 demonstrates calculation of the
project’s future value at the end of its 3-year life, assuming both a 10% (its cost of
capital) and a 15% (its IRR) rate of return. A future value of $248,720 results from
reinvestment at the 10% cost of capital, and a future value of $258,470 results
from reinvestment at the 15% IRR.

PART 5
Long-Term Investment Decisions
4. To eliminate the reinvestment rate assumption of the IRR, some practitioners calculate the modified internal rate
of return (MIRR). The MIRR is found by converting each operating cash inflow to its future value measured at the
end of the project’s life and then summing the future values of all inflows to get the project’s terminal value. Each
future value is found by using the cost of capital, thereby eliminating the reinvestment rate criticism of the tradi-
tional IRR. The MIRR represents the discount rate that causes the terminal value just to equal the initial investment.
Because it uses the cost of capital as the reinvestment rate the MIRR is generally viewed as a better measure of a pro-
ject’s true profitability than the IRR. Although this technique is frequently used in commercial real estate valuation
and is a preprogrammed function on some financial calculators, its failure to resolve the issue of conflicting rankings
and its theoretical inferiority to NPV have resulted in the MIRR receiving only limited attention and acceptance in
the financial literature.
conflicting rankings
Conflicts in the ranking given 
a project by NPV and IRR,
resulting from differences in 
the magnitude and timing of
cash flows.
intermediate cash inflows
Cash inflows received prior to
the termination of a project.

If the future value in each case in Table 10.5 were viewed as the return
received 3 years from today from the $170,000 initial investment, the cash flows
would be those given in Table 10.6. The NPVs and IRRs in each case are shown
below the cash flows in Table 10.6. You can see that at the 10% reinvestment
rate, the NPV remains at $16,867; reinvestment at the 15% IRR produces an
NPV of $24,418.
From this result, it should be clear that the NPV technique assumes reinvest-
ment at the cost of capital (10% in this example). (Note that with reinvestment at
10%, the IRR would be 13.5%.) On the other hand, the IRR technique assumes
an ability to reinvest intermediate cash inflows at the IRR. If reinvestment does
not occur at this rate, the IRR will differ from 15%. Reinvestment at a rate lower
than the IRR would result in an IRR lower than that calculated (at 13.5%, for
example, if the reinvestment rate were only 10%). Reinvestment at a rate higher
than the IRR would result in an IRR higher than that calculated.

Timing of the Cash Flow
Another reason why the IRR and NPV methods may provide different rankings
for investment options has to do with differences in the timing of cash flows. Go
back to the timelines for investments A and B in Figure 10.1 on page 392. The
up-front investment required by each investment is similar, but after that the
timing of each project’s cash flows is quite different. Project B has a large cash
inflow almost immediately (in Year 1), whereas Project A provides cash flows
that are distributed evenly across time. Because so much of Project B’s cash flows
arrive early in its life (especially compared to the timing for Project A), the NPV
of Project B will not be particularly sensitive to changes in the discount rate.
Project A’s NPV, on the other hand, will fluctuate more as the discount rate
changes. In essence, Project B is somewhat akin to a short-term bond, whose
price doesn’t change much when interest rates move, and Project A is more like a
long-term bond whose price fluctuates a great deal when rates change.
You can see this pattern if you review the NPV profiles for projects A and B
in Figure 10.4 on page 405. The red line representing project A is considerably
steeper than the blue line representing project B. At very low discount rates,
project A has a higher NPV, but as the discount rate increases, the NPV of project A
declines rapidly. When the discount rate is high enough, the NPV of project B
overtakes that of project A.
We can summarize this discussion as follows. Because project A’s cash flows
arrive later than project B’s cash flows do, when the firm’s cost of capital is rela-
tively low (to be specific, below about 10.7 percent), the NPV method will rank
project A ahead of project B. At a higher cost of capital, the early arrival of
project B’s cash flows becomes more advantageous, and the NPV method will
rank project B over project A. The differences in the timing of cash flows between
the two projects does not affect the ranking provided by the IRR method, which
always puts project B ahead of project A. Table 10.7 illustrates how the conflict
in rankings between the NPV and IRR approaches depends on the firm’s cost of
capital.
Magnitude of the Initial Investment
Suppose someone offered you the following two investment options. You could
invest $2 today and receive $3 tomorrow, or you could invest $1,000 today and
receive $1,100 tomorrow. The first investment provides a return (an IRR) of
50 percent in just one day, a return that surely would surpass any reasonable
hurdle rate. But after making this investment, you’re only better off by $1. On the

other hand, the second choice offers a return of 10 percent in a single day. That’s
far less than the first opportunity, but earning 10 percent in a single day is still a
very high return. In addition, if you accept this investment, you will be $100
better off tomorrow than you were today.
Most people would choose the second option presented above, even though
the rate of return on that option (10 percent) is far less than the rate offered by
the first option (50 percent). They reason (correctly) that it is sometimes better to
accept a lower return on a larger investment than to accept a very high return on
a small investment. Said differently, most people know that they are better off
taking the investment that pays them a $100 profit in just one day rather than the
investment that generates just a $1 profit.5
The preceding example illustrates what is known as the scale (or magnitude)
problem. The scale problem occurs when two projects are very different in terms
of how much money is required to invest in each project. In these cases, the IRR
and NPV methods may rank projects differently. The IRR approach (and the PI
method) may favor small projects with high returns (like the $2 loan that turns
into $3), whereas the NPV approach favors the investment that makes the
investor the most money (like the $1,000 investment that yields $1,100 in one
day). In the case of the Bennett Company’s projects, the scale problem is not
likely to be the cause of the conflict in project rankings because the initial invest-
ment required to fund each project is quite similar.
To summarize, it is important for financial managers to keep an eye out for
conflicts in project rankings provided by the NPV and IRR methods, but differ-
ences in the magnitude and timing of cash inflows do not guarantee conflicts in
ranking. In general, the greater the difference between the magnitude and timing
of cash inflows, the greater the likelihood of conflicting rankings. Conflicts based
on NPV and IRR can be reconciled computationally; to do so, one creates and
analyzes an incremental project reflecting the difference in cash flows between
the two mutually exclusive projects. 
WHICH APPROACH IS BETTER?
Many companies use both the NPV and IRR techniques because current tech-
nology makes them easy to calculate. But it is difficult to choose one approach
over the other because the theoretical and practical strengths of the approaches
differ. Clearly, it is wise to evaluate NPV and IRR techniques from both theoret-
ical and practical points of view.
Theoretical View
On a purely theoretical basis, NPV is the better approach to capital budgeting as
a result of several factors. Most important, the NPV measures how much wealth
a project creates (or destroys if the NPV is negative) for shareholders. Given that
the financial manager’s objective is to maximize shareholder wealth, the NPV
approach has the clearest link to this objective and, therefore, is the “gold stan-
dard” for evaluating investment opportunities.

5. Note that the profitability index also provides an incorrect ranking in this example. The first option has a PI of
1.5 ($3
$2), and the second option’s PI equals 1.1 ($1,100
$1,000). Just like the IRR, the PI suggests that the
first option is better, but we know that the second option makes more money.

In addition, certain mathematical properties may cause a project with a
nonconventional cash flow pattern to have multiple IRRs—more than one IRR.6
Mathematically, the maximum number of real roots to an equation is equal to its
number of sign changes. Take an equation like 
, which has two
sign changes in its coefficients—from positive 
to negative 
and then
from negative 
to positive 
. If we factor the equation (remember fac-
toring from high school math?), we get 
, which means that x
can equal either 2 or 3—there are two correct values for x. Substitute them back
into the equation, and you’ll see that both values work.
This same outcome can occur when finding the IRR for projects with non-
conventional cash flows, because they have more than one sign change. Clearly,
when multiple IRRs occur for nonconventional cash flows, the analyst faces the
time-consuming need to interpret their meanings so as to evaluate the project.
The fact that such a challenge does not exist when using NPV enhances its theo-
retical superiority.
Practical View
Evidence suggests that in spite of the theoretical superiority of NPV, financial
managers use the IRR approach just as often as the NPV method. The appeal of
the IRR technique is due to the general disposition of business people to think in
terms of rates of return rather than actual dollar returns. Because interest rates,
profitability, and so on are most often expressed as annual rates of return, the
use of IRR makes sense to financial decision makers. They tend to find NPV less
intuitive because it does not measure benefits relative to the amount invested.
Because a variety of techniques are available for avoiding the pitfalls of the IRR,
its widespread use does not imply a lack of sophistication on the part of finan-
cial decision makers. Clearly, corporate financial analysts are responsible for
identifying and resolving problems with the IRR before the decision makers use
it as a decision technique.

6. A conventional cash flow pattern is one in which the up-front cash flow is negative and all subsequent cash flows
are positive. A nonconventional pattern occurs if the up-front cash flow is positive and subsequent cash flows are
negative (for example, when a firm sells extended warranties and pays benefits later) or when the cash flows oscil-
late between positive and negative (as might occur when firms have to reinvest in a project to extend its life).

Matter of fact
A
recent survey asked chief financial officers (CFOs) what methods they used to evaluate cap-
ital investment projects. One interesting finding was that many companies use more than one
of the approaches we’ve covered in this chapter. The most popular approaches by far were IRR
and NPV, used by 76 percent and 75 percent (respectively) of the CFOs responding to the survey.
These techniques enjoy wider use in larger firms, with the payback approach being more
common in smaller firms.7

focus on ETHICS
Nonfinancial Considerations in Project Selection
Corporate ethics
codes are often faulted
for being “window dressing”— that is,
for having little or no effect on actual
behavior. Financial ethics expert John
Dobson says day-to-day behavior in the
workplace “acculturates” employees—
teaches them that the behavior they see
is rational and acceptable in that envi-
ronment. The good news is that profes-
sional ethics codes, such as those
developed for chartered financial ana-
lysts, corporate treasury professionals,
and certified financial planners, actu-
ally provide sound guidelines for
behavior. These codes, notes Dobson,
are based on economically rational
concepts such as integrity and trustwor-
thiness, which guide the decision
maker in attempting to increase share-
holder wealth. Financial executives
insist that there should be no separation
between an individual’s personal ethics
and his or her business ethics. “It’s a
jungle out there” and “Business is busi-
ness” should not be excuses for engag-
ing in unethical behavior.
How do ethics codes apply to proj-
ect selection and capital budgeting?
For most companies ethical considera-
tions are primarily concerned with the
reduction of potential risks associated
with a project. For example, Gateway
Computers clearly outlines in its corpo-
rate code of ethics the increased regu-
latory and procurement laws with
which an employee must be familiar in
order to sell to the government. The
company points out that knowingly sub-
mitting a false claim or statement to a
governmental agency could subject
Gateway and its employees to signifi-
cant monetary civil damages, penal-
ties, and even criminal sanctions.
Another way to incorporate nonfi-
nancial considerations into capital proj-
ect evaluation is to take into account
the likely effect of decisions on non-
shareholder parties or stakeholders—
employees, customers, the local
community, and suppliers. Chipotle
Mexican Grill’s “Food with Integrity”
mission is one example. Chipotle’s phi-
losophy is that the company “can
always do better in terms of the food
we buy. And when we say better, we
mean better in every sense of the
word—better tasting, coming from bet-
ter sources, better for the environment,
better for the animals, and better for the
farmers who raise the animals and
grow the produce.”a
In support of their mission, Chipotle
sources meat from animals that are
raised humanely, fed a vegetarian diet,
and never given antibiotics or hormones.
The company favors locally grown pro-
duce, organically grown beans, and
dairy products made from milk from
cows raised in pastures and free of
growth hormones. Chipotle’s efforts have
been rewarded, as sales increased by
nearly 50 percent from 2007 to 2009.
Investors have also profited, as shares
that sold for $44 at the company’s
2006 initial public offering were priced
at over $150 in mid-2010.

PART 5
Long-Term Investment Decisions
Summary
FOCUS ON VALUE
The financial manager must apply appropriate decision techniques to assess
whether proposed investment projects create value. Net present value (NPV)
and internal rate of return (IRR) are the generally preferred capital budgeting
techniques. Both use the cost of capital as the required return. The appeal of
NPV and IRR stems from the fact that both indicate whether a proposed invest-
ment creates or destroys shareholder value.
NPV clearly indicates the expected dollar amount of wealth creation from a
proposed project, whereas IRR only provides the same accept-or-reject decision
as NPV. As a consequence of some fundamental differences, NPV and IRR do
not necessarily rank projects in the same way. NPV is the theoretically preferred
approach. In practice, however, IRR enjoys widespread use because of its intu-
itive appeal. Regardless, the application of NPV and IRR to good estimates of
relevant cash flows should enable the financial manager to recommend projects
that are consistent with the firm’s goal of maximizing shareholder wealth.
REVIEW OF LEARNING GOALS
Understand the key elements of the capital budgeting process. Capital
budgeting techniques are the tools used to assess project acceptability and
ranking. Applied to each project’s relevant cash flows, they indicate which cap-
ital expenditures are consistent with the firm’s goal of maximizing owners’
wealth.
Calculate, interpret, and evaluate the payback period. The payback
period is the amount of time required for the firm to recover its initial invest-
ment, as calculated from cash inflows. Shorter payback periods are preferred.
The payback period is relatively easy to calculate, has simple intuitive appeal,
considers cash flows, and measures risk exposure. Its weaknesses include lack
of linkage to the wealth maximization goal, failure to consider time value
explicitly, and the fact that it ignores cash flows that occur after the payback
period.
Calculate, interpret, and evaluate the net present value (NPV) and eco-
nomic value added (EVA). Because it gives explicit consideration to the time
value of money, NPV is considered a sophisticated capital budgeting technique.
NPV measures the amount of value created by a given project; only positive
NPV projects are acceptable. The rate at which cash flows are discounted in 
calculating NPV is called the discount rate, required return, cost of capital, or
opportunity cost. By whatever name, this rate represents the minimum return
that must be earned on a project to leave the firm’s market value unchanged.
The EVA method begins the same way that NPV does—by calculating a pro-
ject’s net cash flows. However, the EVA approach subtracts from those cash
flows a charge that is designed to capture the return that the firm’s investors
LG 3
LG 2
LG 1

demand on the project. That is, the EVA calculation asks whether a project 
generates positive cash flows above and beyond what investors demand. If so,
then the project is worth undertaking.
Calculate, interpret, and evaluate the internal rate of return (IRR).
Like NPV, IRR is a sophisticated capital budgeting technique. IRR is the com-
pound annual rate of return that the firm will earn by investing in a project and
receiving the given cash inflows. By accepting only those projects with IRRs in
excess of the firm’s cost of capital, the firm should enhance its market value and
the wealth of its owners. Both NPV and IRR yield the same accept–reject deci-
sions, but they often provide conflicting rankings.
Use net present value profiles to compare NPV and IRR techniques. A
net present value profile is a graph that depicts projects’ NPVs for various dis-
count rates. The NPV profile is prepared by developing a number of “discount
rate–net present value” coordinates (including discount rates of 0 percent, the
cost of capital, and the IRR for each project) and then plotting them on the
same set of discount rate–NPV axes.
Discuss NPV and IRR in terms of conflicting rankings and the theoret-
ical and practical strengths of each approach. Conflicting rankings of projects
frequently emerge from NPV and IRR as a result of differences in the reinvest-
ment rate assumption, as well as the magnitude and timing of cash flows. NPV
assumes reinvestment of intermediate cash inflows at the more conservative cost
of capital; IRR assumes reinvestment at the project’s IRR. On a purely theo-
retical basis, NPV is preferred over IRR because NPV assumes the more con-
servative reinvestment rate and does not exhibit the mathematical problem of
multiple IRRs that often occurs when IRRs are calculated for nonconventional
cash flows. In practice, the IRR is more commonly used because it is consistent
with the general preference of business professionals for rates of return, and cor-
porate financial analysts can identify and resolve problems with the IRR before
decision makers use it.

To sustain a high growth rate, the HFGC CEO argues that the company must con-
tinue to invest in projects that offer the highest rate of return possible. Two projects
are currently under review. The first is an expansion of the firm’s production capacity,
and the second project involves introducing one of the firm’s existing products into a

ETHICS PROBLEM Gap, Inc., is trying to incorporate human resource and supplier
considerations into its management decision making. Here is Gap’s report of find-
ings from a recent Social Responsibility Report:
Because factory owners sometimes try to hide violations, Gap emphasizes training
for factory managers. However, due to regional differences, the training varies from
one site to another. The report notes that 10 to 25 percent of workers in China,
Taiwan, and Saipan have been harassed and humiliated. Less than half of the facto-
ries in sub-Saharan Africa have adequate worker safety regulations and infrastruc-
ture. In Mexico, Latin America, and the Caribbean, 25 to 50 percent of the suppliers
fail to pay even the minimum wage.
Calvert Group, Ltd., a mutual fund family that focuses on “socially responsible
investing,” had this to say about the impact of Gap’s report:
With revenues of $15.9 billion and over 300,000 employees worldwide, Gap leads
the U.S. apparel sector and has contracts with over 3,000 factories globally. Calvert
has been in dialogue with Gap for about five years, the last two as part of the
Working Group.
Gap’s supplier monitoring program focuses on remediation, because its sup-
pliers produce for multiple apparel companies and would likely move their capacity
to different clients rather than adopt conditions deemed too demanding. About one-
third of the factories Gap examined comfortably met Gap’s criteria, another third
had barely acceptable conditions, and the final third missed the minimum standards.
Gap terminated contracts with 136 factories where it found conditions to be beyond
remediation.
Increased transparency and disclosure are crucial in measuring a company’s
commitment to raising human rights standards and improving the lives of workers.
Gap’s report is an important first step in the direction of a model format that other
companies can adapt.8
If Gap were to aggressively pursue renegotiations with suppliers, based on this
report, what is the likely effect on Gap’s expenses in the next 5 years? In your
opinion, what would be the impact on its stock price in the immediate future? After
10 years?

Why This Chapter Matters to You
In your professional life
ACCOUNTING You need to understand capital budgeting cash flows
to provide revenue, cost, depreciation, and tax data for use both in
monitoring existing projects and in developing cash flows for proposed
projects.
INFORMATION SYSTEMS You need to understand capital budgeting
cash flows to maintain and facilitate the retrieval of cash flow data for
both completed and existing projects.
MANAGEMENT You need to understand capital budgeting cash flows
so that you will understand which cash flows are relevant in making
decisions about proposals for acquiring additional production facilities,
for new marketing programs, for new products, and for the expansion
of existing product lines.
MARKETING You need to understand capital budgeting cash flows so
that you can make revenue and cost estimates for proposals for new
marketing programs, for new products, and for the expansion of
existing product lines.
OPERATIONS You need to understand capital budgeting cash flows so
that you can make revenue and cost estimates for proposals for the
acquisition of new equipment and production facilities.
You are not mandated to provide
financial statements prepared using
GAAP, so you naturally focus on cash flows. When considering a
major outflow of funds (for example, purchase of a house, funding of a
college education), you can project the associated cash flows and use
these estimates to assess the value and affordability of the assets and
any associated future outlays.

Maintaining Its Project Inventory
A
s the largest publicly traded oil company in the
world, ExxonMobil’s long-term investments are
at the heart of its ability to generate shareholder
wealth. Its 2009 earnings of more than $19 billion
resulted in a 16 percent return on capital invested.
Through dividends and share repurchases, ExxonMobil
returned $26 billion to its shareholders in 2009 and
more than $150 billion over the previous five years.
To maintain its petroleum reserves, ExxonMobil
must continually add to its inventory of discovered oil
and gas resources. It holds exploration rights to 109
million undeveloped acres in 37 countries. Each year,
the company initiates a number of megaprojects that
add to its exploration rights, locate and “prove” addi-
tional reserves, or increase the productivity of currently
producing wells.
Total capital and exploration expenditures in 2009 amounted to a record $27 billion.
Within the next 5 years, ExxonMobil anticipates investing more than $125 billion. ExxonMobil
has partnered with Qatar Petroleum to develop a global-scale petrochemical complex in Ras
Laffan Industrial City, Qatar. The plant is expected to start up in late 2015, and it will include
two 650,000 ton-per-year polyethylene plants, a 1.6 million-ton-per-year steam cracker, and a
700,000 ton-per-year ethylene glycol facility.
While Exxon is often able to bring in projects on or under budget, increasing costs could
cause some future development projects to go over budget. Drilling and exploration costs are
expected to rise. Recent high oil prices have led to a surge in demand for exploration, and the
cost of drilling equipment and workers has jumped at least 15 percent a year during the last sev-
eral years. Further complicating oil production efforts in the future will be an increase in the use
of less-than-suitable oil sources, such as shale oil and tar sands.
Like ExxonMobil, every firm must evaluate the costs and returns of projects for expansion,
asset replacement or renewal, research and development, advertising, and other areas that
require a long-term commitment of funds in expectation of future returns. Chapter 11 explains
how to identify the relevant cash outflows and inflows that must be considered in making major
investment decisions.

PART 5
Long-Term Investment Decisions
11.1 Relevant Cash Flows
Chapter 10 introduced the capital budgeting process and the techniques financial
managers use for evaluating and selecting long-term investments. To evaluate invest-
ment opportunities, financial managers must determine the relevant cash flows asso-
ciated with the project. These are the incremental cash outflows (investment) and
inflows (return). The incremental cash flows represent the additional cash flows—
outflows or inflows—expected to result from a proposed capital expenditure. As
noted in Chapter 4, cash flows rather than accounting figures are used because cash
flows directly affect the firm’s ability to pay bills and purchase assets. The nearby
Focus on Ethics box discusses the accuracy of cash flow estimates and cites one
reason that even well-estimated deals may not work out as planned.
The remainder of this chapter is devoted to the procedures for measuring the
relevant cash flows associated with proposed capital expenditures.
MAJOR CASH FLOW COMPONENTS
The cash flows of any project may include three basic components: (1) an initial
investment, (2) operating cash inflows, and (3) terminal cash flow. All projects—
whether for expansion, replacement or renewal, or some other purpose—have the
first two components. Some, however, lack the final component, terminal cash flow.

focus on ETHICS
A Question of Accuracy
The process of capital
budgeting based on
projected cash flows has been a part of
the investment decision process for more
than 40 years. This procedure for evalu-
ating investment opportunities works
well when cash flows can be estimated
with certainty, but in real-world corpo-
rate practice, many investment decisions
involve a high degree of uncertainty.
The decision is even more complicated
when the project under consideration is
the acquisition of another company or
part of another company.
Because estimates of the cash flows
from an investment project involve mak-
ing assumptions about the future, they
may be subject to considerable error.
The problem becomes more compli-
cated as the period of time under con-
sideration becomes longer and when
the project is unique in nature with no
comparables. Other complications may
arise involving accounting for additional
(extraordinary) cash flows—for example,
the cost of litigation, compliance with
tougher environmental standards, or the
costs of disposal or recycling of an asset
at the completion of the project.
All too often, the initial champagne
celebration gives way once the final
cost of a deal is tallied. In fact, taken
as a whole, mergers and acquisitions in
recent years have produced a disheart-
ening negative 12 percent return on
investment. While the financial data
necessary to generate discounted cash
flow estimates are ever more readily
available, these days more attention is
being paid to the accuracy of the num-
bers. Inspired in part by post-Enron
focus on governance and the threat of
shareholder lawsuits, board members
have been pushing corporate managers
to make a stronger case for the deals
they propose. Says Glenn Gurtcheff,
managing director and co-head of mid-
dle market M&A for Piper Jaffray & Co.,
“They’re not just taking the company’s
audited and unaudited financial state-
ments at face value; they are really div-
ing into the numbers and trying to
understand not just their accuracy, but
what they mean in terms of trends.”
If valuation has improved so much,
why do analyses show that companies
often overpay? The answer lies in the
imperial CEO. Improvements in valuation
techniques can be negated when the
process deteriorates into a game of
tweaking the numbers to justify a deal
the CEO wants to do, regardless of
price. This “make it work” form of capital
budgeting often results in building the
empire under the CEO’s control at the
expense of the firm’s shareholders.
3 What would your options be when
faced with the demands of an impe-
rial CEO who expects you to “make
it work”? Brainstorm several
options.
in practice

Figure 11.1 depicts on a time line the cash flows for a project. The initial
investment for the proposed project is $50,000. This is the relevant cash outflow at
time zero. The operating cash inflows, which are the incremental after-tax cash
inflows resulting from implementation of the project during its life, gradually
increase from $4,000 in its first year to $10,000 in its tenth and final year. The
terminal cash flow is the after-tax nonoperating cash flow occurring in the final
year of the project. It is usually attributable to liquidation of the project. In this case
it is $25,000, received at the end of the project’s 10-year life. Note that the terminal
cash flow does not include the $10,000 operating cash inflow for year 10.
EXPANSION VERSUS REPLACEMENT DECISIONS
Developing relevant cash flow estimates is most straightforward in the case of
expansion decisions. In this case, the initial investment, operating cash inflows,
and terminal cash flow are merely the after-tax cash outflow and inflows associ-
ated with the proposed capital expenditure.
Identifying relevant cash flows for replacement decisions is more compli-
cated, because the firm must identify the incremental cash outflow and inflows
that would result from the proposed replacement. The initial investment in the
case of replacement is the difference between the initial investment needed to
acquire the new asset and any after-tax cash inflows expected from liquidation of
the old asset. The operating cash inflows are the difference between the operating
cash inflows from the new asset and those from the old asset. The terminal cash
flow is the difference between the after-tax cash flows expected upon termination
of the new and the old assets. These relationships are shown in Figure 11.2.
Actually, all capital budgeting decisions can be viewed as replacement deci-
sions. Expansion decisions are merely replacement decisions in which all cash
flows from the old asset are zero. In light of this fact, this chapter focuses prima-
rily on replacement decisions.
SUNK COSTS AND OPPORTUNITY COSTS
When estimating the relevant cash flows associated with a proposed capital
expenditure, the firm must recognize any sunk costs and opportunity costs. These
costs are easy to mishandle or ignore, particularly when determining a project’s

incremental cash flows. Sunk costs are cash outlays that have already been made
(past outlays) and therefore have no effect on the cash flows relevant to the cur-
rent decision. As a result, sunk costs should not be included in a project’s incre-
mental cash flows.
Opportunity costs are cash flows that could be realized from the best alter-
native use of an owned asset. They therefore represent cash flows that will not be
realized as a result of employing that asset in the proposed project. Because of
this, any opportunity costs should be included as cash outflows when one is
determining a project’s incremental cash flows.
Jankow Equipment is considering renewing its drill press X12, which it purchased
3 years earlier for $237,000, by retrofitting it with the computerized control
system from an obsolete piece of equipment it owns. The obsolete equipment
could be sold today for a high bid of $42,000, but without its computerized con-
trol system, it would be worth nothing. Jankow is in the process of estimating the
labor and materials costs of retrofitting the system to drill press X12 and the ben-
efits expected from the retrofit. The $237,000 cost of drill press X12 is a sunk cost
because it represents an earlier cash outlay. It would not be included as a cash out-
flow when determining the cash flows relevant to the retrofit decision. Although
Jankow owns the obsolete piece of equipment, the proposed use of its computer-
ized control system represents an opportunity cost of $42,000—the highest price
at which it could be sold today. This opportunity cost would be included as a cash
outflow associated with using the computerized control system.
INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL BUDGETING AND LONG-TERM
INVESTMENTS
Although the same basic capital budgeting principles are used for domestic and
international projects, several additional factors must be addressed in evaluating
foreign investment opportunities. International capital budgeting differs from the

domestic version because (1) cash outflows and inflows occur in a foreign cur-
rency, and (2) foreign investments entail potentially significant political risk. Both
of these risks can be minimized through careful planning.
Companies face both long-term and short-term currency risks related to both
the invested capital and the cash flows resulting from it. Long-term currency risk
can be minimized by financing the foreign investment at least partly in the local
capital markets. This step ensures that the project’s revenues, operating costs, and
financing costs will be in the local currency. Likewise, the dollar value of short-
term, local-currency cash flows can be protected by using special securities and
strategies such as futures, forwards, and options market instruments.
Political risks can be minimized by using both operating and financial strate-
gies. For example, by structuring the investment as a joint venture and selecting a
well-connected local partner, the U.S. company can minimize the risk of its oper-
ations being seized or harassed. Companies also can protect themselves from
having their investment returns blocked by local governments by structuring the
financing of such investments as debt rather than as equity. Debt-service pay-
ments are legally enforceable claims, whereas equity returns (such as dividends)
are not. Even if local courts do not support the claims of the U.S. company, the
company can threaten to pursue its case in U.S. courts.
In spite of the preceding difficulties, foreign direct investment (FDI), which
involves the transfer of capital, managerial, and technical assets to a foreign
country, has surged in recent years. This is evident in the growing market values
of foreign assets owned by U.S.–based companies and of foreign direct invest-
ment in the United States, particularly by British, Canadian, Dutch, German, and
Japanese companies. Furthermore, foreign direct investment by U.S. companies
seems to be accelerating. See the Global Focus box on page 432 for a discussion
of recent foreign direct investment in China.

Matter of fact
A
ccording to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), FDI
plays an important role in the U.S. economy. BEA divides FDI into two categories: Greenfield 
Investment and Mergers and Acquisitions. Greenfield investments create new enterprises and
develop or expand production facilities, while Mergers and Acquisitions involve the purchase of
an existing enterprise.
In 2008 the United States was the world’s largest recipient of FDI, receiving more than
$325.3 billion in FDI. This amount was a 37 percent increase from the previous year. Further, the
$2.1 trillion worth of FDI in the United States at the end of 2008 is the equivalent of approxi-
mately 16 percent of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP).

Long-Term Investment Decisions
GLOBAL focus
Changes May Influence Future Investments in China
Foreign direct invest-
ment in China soared
in 2009. Not including banks, insur-
ance, and securities, foreign direct
investment amounted to $90 billion.
China’s economy has surged more than
tenfold since 1980, the first year it
allowed foreign investments, when
money began pouring into factories on
China’s east coast.
China’s trade surplus in 2009 was
$196 billion. With a strong foreign
exchange surplus, China is no longer
desperate for capital from overseas but
is now primarily interested in foreign
skills and technologies. Prime Minister
Wen Jiabao wants to steer investments
toward the manufacturing of higher-
value products and toward less-
developed regions. Wen is giving tax
breaks and promising speedy
approvals for investments away from
areas in the east, such as Shanghai
and the Pearl River Delta.
Typical of foreign investors in China
is Intel Capital, a subsidiary of Intel
Corporation. As of the middle of
2010, Intel Capital’s portfolio had
$200 million invested in 25 Chinese
companies. Intel Capital is no beginner
at foreign investment; it has invested
more than $4 billion in more than
1,000 companies around the world.
China allows three types of foreign
investments: a wholly foreign-owned
enterprise (WFOE) in which the firm is
entirely funded with foreign capital; a
joint venture in which the foreign part-
ner must provide at least 25 percent of
initial capital; and a representative
office (RO), the most common and eas-
ily established entity, which cannot per-
form business activities that directly
result in profits. Generally an RO is the
first step in establishing a China pres-
ence and includes mechanisms for
upgrading to a WFOE or joint 
venture.
As with any foreign investment,
investing in China is not without risk.
One potential risk facing foreign
investors in China is that the communist
government could decide to nationalize
private companies. Many public com-
panies in China are firms that were
once owned by the communist govern-
ment, such as China Life Insurance
Company, and it is always possible
that the communist government may
decide that it wishes to own and con-
trol these companies again. The list of
governments similar to China’s that
have nationalized private companies is
fairly long. While there is no evidence
that this will happen in China, it should
be considered one of the risks.
3 Although China has been actively
campaigning for foreign investment,
how do you think having a commu-
nist government affects its foreign
investment?
in practice
11.2 Finding the Initial Investment
The term initial investment as used here refers to the relevant cash outflows to be
considered when evaluating a prospective capital expenditure. Our discussion of
capital budgeting will focus on projects with initial investments that occur at time
zero—the time at which the expenditure is made. The initial investment is calcu-
lated by subtracting all cash inflows occurring at time zero from all cash outflows
occurring at time zero.
The basic format for determining the initial investment is given in Table 11.1.
The cash flows that must be considered when determining the initial investment
associated with a capital expenditure are the installed cost of the new asset, the
after-tax proceeds (if any) from the sale of an old asset, and the change (if any) in
LG 4
LG 3

net working capital. Note that if there are no installation costs and the firm is not
replacing an existing asset, then the cost (purchase price) of the new asset,
adjusted for any change in net working capital, is equal to the initial investment.
INSTALLED COST OF NEW ASSET
As shown in Table 11.1, the installed cost of the new asset is found by adding the
cost of the new asset to its installation costs. The cost of new asset is the net out-
flow that its acquisition requires. Usually, we are concerned with the acquisition
of a fixed asset for which a definite purchase price is paid. Installation costs are
any added costs that are necessary to place an asset into operation. The Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) requires the firm to add installation costs to the purchase
price of an asset to determine its depreciable value, which is expensed over a
period of years. The installed cost of new asset, calculated by adding the cost of
new asset to its installation costs, equals its depreciable value.
AFTER-TAX PROCEEDS FROM SALE OF OLD ASSET
Table 11.1 shows that the after-tax proceeds from sale of old asset decrease the
firm’s initial investment in the new asset. These proceeds are the difference
between the old asset’s sale proceeds and any applicable taxes or tax refunds
related to its sale. The proceeds from sale of old asset are the net cash inflows it
provides. This amount is net of any costs incurred in the process of removing
the asset. Included in these removal costs are cleanup costs, such as those
related to removal and disposal of chemical and nuclear wastes. These costs
may not be trivial.
The proceeds from the sale of an old asset are normally subject to some type
of tax.1 This tax on sale of old asset depends on the relationship between its sale
price and book value and on existing government tax rules.

between them in the following discussions.

tax on sale of old asset
Tax that depends on the
relationship between the old
asset’s sale price and book
value and on existing
government tax rules.

Book Value
The book value of an asset is its strict accounting value. It can be calculated by
using the following equation:
(11.1)
Hudson Industries, a small electronics company, 2 years ago acquired a machine
tool with an installed cost of $100,000. The asset was being depreciated under
MACRS using a 5-year recovery period. Table 4.2 (on page 117) shows that
under MACRS for a 5-year recovery period, 20% and 32% of the installed cost
would be depreciated in years 1 and 2, respectively. In other words, 52%
(20%
32%) of the $100,000 cost, or $52,000 (0.52
$100,000), would rep-
resent the accumulated depreciation at the end of year 2. Substituting into
Equation 11.1, we get
The book value of Hudson’s asset at the end of year 2 is therefore $48,000.
Basic Tax Rules
Three potential tax situations can occur when a firm sells an asset. These situa-
tions depend on the relationship between the asset’s sale price and its book value.
The two key forms of taxable income and their associated tax treatments are
defined and summarized in Table 11.2. The assumed tax rates used throughout
this text are noted in the final column. There are three possible tax situations.
The asset may be sold (1) for more than its book value, (2) for its book value, or
(3) for less than its book value. An example will illustrate.
The old asset purchased 2 years ago for $100,000 by Hudson Industries has a
current book value of $48,000. What will happen if the firm now decides to sell
the asset and replace it? The tax consequences depend on the sale price.
Figure 11.3 depicts the taxable income resulting from four possible sale prices in
light of the asset’s initial purchase price of $100,000 and its current book value of

$48,000. The taxable consequences of each of these sale prices are described in
the following paragraphs.
The sale of the asset for more than its book value
If Hudson sells the old asset
for $110,000, it realizes a gain of $62,000 ($110,000
$48,000). Technically
this gain is made up of two parts—a capital gain and recaptured depreciation,
which is the portion of the sale price that is above book value and below the ini-
tial purchase price. For Hudson, the capital gain is $10,000 ($110,000 sale
price
$100,000 initial purchase price); recaptured depreciation is $52,000 (the
$100,000 initial purchase price
$48,000 book value).
Both the $10,000 capital gain and the $52,000 recaptured depreciation are
shown under the $110,000 sale price in Figure 11.3. The total gain above book
value of $62,000 is taxed as ordinary income at the 40% rate, resulting in taxes
of $24,800 (0.40
$62,000). These taxes should be used in calculating the ini-
tial investment in the new asset, using the format in Table 11.1. In effect, the
taxes raise the amount of the firm’s initial investment in the new asset by reducing
the proceeds from the sale of the old asset.
If Hudson instead sells the old asset for $70,000, it experiences a gain above book
value (in the form of recaptured depreciation) of $22,000 ($70,000
$48,000), as
shown under the $70,000 sale price in Figure 11.3. This gain is taxed as ordinary
income. Because the firm is assumed to be in the 40% tax bracket, the taxes on the
$22,000 gain are $8,800 (0.40
$22,000). This amount in taxes should be used
in calculating the initial investment in the new asset.

The sale of the asset for its book value
If the asset is sold for $48,000, its book
value, the firm breaks even. There is no gain or loss, as shown under the $48,000
sale price in Figure 11.3. Because no tax results from selling an asset for its book
value, there is no tax effect on the initial investment in the new asset.
The sale of the asset for less than its book value
If Hudson sells the asset for
$30,000, it experiences a loss of $18,000 ($48,000
$30,000), as shown under the
$30,000 sale price in Figure 11.3. If this is a depreciable asset used in the business,
the firm may use the loss to offset ordinary operating income. If the asset is not
depreciable or is not used in the business, the firm can use the loss only to offset cap-
ital gains. In either case, the loss will save the firm $7,200 (0.40
$18,000) in
taxes. And, if current operating earnings or capital gains are not sufficient to offset
the loss, the firm may be able to apply these losses to prior or future years’ taxes.
CHANGE IN NET WORKING CAPITAL
Net working capital is the difference between the firm’s current assets and its cur-
rent liabilities. This topic is treated in depth in Chapter 15; at this point it is
important to note that changes in net working capital often accompany capital
expenditure decisions. If a firm acquires new machinery to expand its level of
operations, it will experience an increase in levels of cash, accounts receivable,
inventories, accounts payable, and accruals. These increases result from the need
for more cash to support expanded operations, more accounts receivable and
inventories to support increased sales, and more accounts payable and accruals to
support increased outlays made to meet expanded product demand. As noted in
Chapter 4, increases in cash, accounts receivable, and inventories are outflows of
cash, whereas increases in accounts payable and accruals are inflows of cash.
The difference between the change in current assets and the change in current
liabilities is the change in net working capital. Generally, current assets increase
by more than current liabilities, resulting in an increased investment in net
working capital. This increased investment is treated as an initial outflow.2 If the
change in net working capital were negative, it would be shown as an initial
inflow. The change in net working capital—regardless of whether it is an increase
or a decrease—is not taxable because it merely involves a net buildup or net
reduction of current accounts.
Danson Company, a metal products manufacturer, is contemplating expanding
its operations. Financial analysts expect that the changes in current accounts
summarized in Table 11.3 will occur and will be maintained over the life of the
expansion. Current assets are expected to increase by $22,000, and current lia-
bilities are expected to increase by $9,000, resulting in a $13,000 increase in net
working capital. In this case, the change will represent an increased net working
capital investment and will be treated as a cash outflow in calculating the initial
investment.

2. When changes in net working capital apply to the initial investment associated with a proposed capital expendi-
ture, they are for convenience assumed to be instantaneous and thereby occurring at time zero. In practice, the
change in net working capital will frequently occur over a period of months as the capital expenditure is imple-
mented.

CALCULATING THE INITIAL INVESTMENT
A variety of tax and other considerations enter into the initial investment calcula-
tion. The following example illustrates calculation of the initial investment
according to the format in Table 11.1.3
Powell Corporation, a large, diversified manufacturer of aircraft components, is
trying to determine the initial investment required to replace an old machine with
a new, more sophisticated model. The proposed machine’s purchase price is
$380,000, and an additional $20,000 will be necessary to install it. It will be
depreciated under MACRS using a 5-year recovery period. The present (old)
machine was purchased 3 years ago at a cost of $240,000 and was being depreci-
ated under MACRS using a 5-year recovery period. The firm has found a buyer
willing to pay $280,000 for the present machine and to remove it at the buyer’s
expense. The firm expects that a $35,000 increase in current assets and an
$18,000 increase in current liabilities will accompany the replacement; these
changes will result in a $17,000 ($35,000
$18,000) increase in net working
capital. The firm pays taxes at a rate of 40%.
The only component of the initial investment calculation that is difficult
to obtain is taxes. The book value of the present machine can be found by
using the depreciation percentages from Table 4.2 (on page 117) of 20%,
32%, and 19% for years 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The resulting book value is
$69,600
. A gain of $210,400
is realized on the sale. The total taxes on the gain are
$84,160 
. These taxes must be subtracted from the $280,000
sale price of the present machine to calculate the after-tax proceeds from its sale.

3. Throughout the discussions of capital budgeting, all assets evaluated as candidates for replacement are assumed
to be depreciable assets that are directly used in the business, so any losses on the sale of these assets can be applied
against ordinary operating income. The decisions are also structured to ensure that the usable life remaining on the
old asset is just equal to the life of the new asset; this assumption enables us to avoid the problem of unequal lives,
which is discussed in Chapter 12.

Substituting the relevant amounts into the format in Table 11.1 results in an
initial investment of $221,160, which represents the net cash outflow required at
time zero.

11.3 Finding the Operating Cash Inflows
The benefits expected from a capital expenditure or “project” are embodied in its
operating cash inflows, which are incremental after-tax cash inflows. In this sec-
tion, we use the income statement format to develop clear definitions of the terms
after-tax, cash inflows, and incremental.
INTERPRETING THE TERM AFTER-TAX
Benefits expected to result from proposed capital expenditures must be measured
on an after-tax basis because the firm will not have the use of any benefits until it
has satisfied the government’s tax claims. These claims depend on the firm’s tax-
able income, so deducting taxes before making comparisons between proposed
investments is necessary for consistency when evaluating capital expenditure
alternatives.
LG 5

INTERPRETING THE TERM CASH INFLOWS
All benefits expected from a proposed project must be measured on a cash flow
basis. Cash inflows represent dollars that can be spent, not merely “accounting
profits.” There is a simple technique for converting after-tax net profits into
operating cash inflows. The basic calculation requires adding depreciation and
any other noncash charges (amortization and depletion) deducted as expenses
on the firm’s income statement back to net profits after taxes. Because deprecia-
tion is commonly found on income statements, it is the only noncash charge we
consider.
Powell Corporation’s estimates of its revenue and expenses (excluding deprecia-
tion and interest), with and without the proposed new machine described in
Example 11.5, are given in Table 11.4. Note that both the expected usable life of the
proposed machine and the remaining usable life of the present machine are 5 years.
The amount to be depreciated with the proposed machine is calculated by sum-
ming the purchase price of $380,000 and the installation costs of $20,000. The
proposed machine is to be depreciated under MACRS using a 5-year recovery
period.4 The resulting depreciation on this machine for each of the 6 years, as
well as the remaining 3 years of depreciation (years 4, 5, and 6) on the present
machine, are calculated in Table 11.5 (see page 440).5
The operating cash inflows each year can be calculated by using the income
statement format shown in Table 11.6 (see page 440). Note that we exclude
interest because we are focusing purely on the “investment decision.” The interest
is relevant to the “financing decision,” which is separately considered. Because we
exclude interest expense, “earnings before interest and taxes” (EBIT) is equivalent
to “net profits before taxes,” and the calculation of “operating cash inflow” in
Example 11.6 3
CHAPTER 11

4. As noted in Chapter 4, it takes 
years to depreciate an n-year class asset under current tax law. Therefore,
MACRS percentages are given for each of 6 years for use in depreciating an asset with a 5-year recovery period.
5. It is important to recognize that, although both machines will provide 5 years of use, the proposed new machine
will be depreciated over the 6-year period, whereas the present machine, as noted in the preceding example, has been
depreciated over 3 years and therefore has remaining only its final 3 years (years 4, 5, and 6) of depreciation (12%,
12%, and 5%, respectively, under MACRS).

Substituting the data from Tables 11.4 and 11.5 into this format and assuming
a 40% tax rate, we get Table 11.7. It demonstrates the calculation of operating
cash inflows for each year for both the proposed and the present machine. Because
the proposed machine is depreciated over 6 years, the analysis must be performed

resulting operating cash inflows are shown in the final row of Table 11.7 for each
machine. The $8,000 year-6 operating cash inflow for the proposed machine
results solely from the tax benefit of its year-6 depreciation deduction.6
INTERPRETING THE TERM INCREMENTAL
The final step in estimating the operating cash inflows for a proposed replacement
project is to calculate the incremental (relevant) cash inflows. Incremental operating
cash inflows are needed because our concern is only with the change in operating
cash inflows that result from the proposed project. Clearly, if this were an expansion
project, the project’s cash flows would be the incremental cash flows.

later be eliminated as a result of the assumed sale of the machine at the end of year 5.

Table 11.8 demonstrates the calculation of Powell Corporation’s incremental (rel-
evant) operating cash inflows for each year. The estimates of operating cash
inflows developed in Table 11.7 appear in columns 1 and 2. Column 2 values rep-
resent the amount of operating cash inflows that Powell Corporation will receive
if it does not replace the present machine. If the proposed machine replaces the
present machine, the firm’s operating cash inflows for each year will be those
shown in column 1. Subtracting the present machine’s operating cash inflows
from the proposed machine’s operating cash inflows, we get the incremental
operating cash inflows for each year, shown in column 3. These cash flows repre-
sent the amounts by which each respective year’s cash inflows will increase as a
result of the replacement. For example, in year 1, Powell Corporation’s cash
inflows would increase by $26,480 if the proposed project were undertaken.
Clearly, these are the relevant inflows to be considered when evaluating the bene-
fits of making a capital expenditure for the proposed machine.7

CHAPTER 11
Capital Budgeting Cash Flows

11.4 Finding the Terminal Cash Flow
Terminal cash flow is the cash flow resulting from termination and liquidation of
a project at the end of its economic life. It represents the after-tax cash flow,
exclusive of operating cash inflows, that occurs in the final year of the project.
When it applies, this flow can significantly affect the capital expenditure decision.
Terminal cash flow can be calculated for replacement projects by using the basic
format presented in Table 11.9.
PROCEEDS FROM SALE OF ASSETS
The proceeds from sale of the new and the old asset, often called “salvage value,”
represent the amount net of any removal or cleanup costs expected on termina-
tion of the project. For replacement projects, proceeds from both the new asset
and the old asset must be considered. For expansion and renewal types of capital
expenditures, the proceeds from the old asset are zero. Of course, it is not unusual
for the value of an asset to be zero at the termination of a project.
TAXES ON SALE OF ASSETS
When the investment being analyzed involves replacing an old asset with a new
one, there are two key elements in finding the terminal cash flow. First, at the end
of the project’s life, the firm will dispose of the new asset, so the after-tax pro-
ceeds from selling the new asset represent a cash inflow. However, remember that
if the firm had not replaced the old asset, the firm would have received proceeds
from disposal of the old asset at the end of the project (rather than counting those
proceeds up front as part of the initial investment). Therefore, we must count as a
cash outflow the after-tax proceeds that the firm would have received from disposal
of the old asset. Taxes come into play whenever an asset is sold for a value dif-
ferent from its book value. If the net proceeds from the sale are expected to exceed

book value, a tax payment shown as an outflow (deduction from sale proceeds) will
occur. When the net proceeds from the sale are less than book value, a tax rebate
shown as a cash inflow (addition to sale proceeds) will result. For assets sold to
net exactly book value, no taxes will be due.
CHANGE IN NET WORKING CAPITAL
When we calculated the initial investment, we took into account any change in
net working capital that is attributable to the new asset. Now, when we calculate
the terminal cash flow, the change in net working capital represents the reversion
of any initial net working capital investment. Most often, this will show up as a
cash inflow due to the reduction in net working capital; with termination of the
project, the need for the increased net working capital investment is assumed to
end.8 Because the net working capital investment is in no way consumed, the
amount recovered at termination will equal the amount shown in the calculation
of the initial investment. Tax considerations are not involved.
Calculating the terminal cash flow involves the same procedures as those
used to find the initial investment. In the following example, the terminal cash
flow is calculated for a replacement decision.
Continuing with the Powell Corporation example, assume that the firm expects
to be able to liquidate the new machine at the end of its 5-year usable life to net
$50,000 after paying removal and cleanup costs. Had it not been replaced by the
new machine, the old machine would have been liquidated at the end of the 5 years
to net $10,000. The firm expects to recover its $17,000 net working capital
investment upon termination of the project. The firm pays taxes at a rate of 40%.
From the analysis of the operating cash inflows presented earlier, we can see
that the proposed (new) machine will have a book value of $20,000 (equal to the
year-6 depreciation) at the end of 5 years. The present (old) machine would have
been fully depreciated and therefore would have a book value of zero at the end
of the 5 years. Because the sale price of $50,000 for the proposed (new) machine
is below its initial installed cost of $400,000 but greater than its book value of
$20,000, taxes will have to be paid only on the recaptured depreciation of
$30,000 ($50,000 sale proceeds
$20,000 book value). Applying the ordinary
tax rate of 40% to this $30,000 results in a tax of $12,000 (0.40
$30,000) on
the sale of the proposed machine. Its after-tax sale proceeds would therefore
equal $38,000 ($50,000 sale proceeds
$12,000 taxes). Because the old
machine would have been sold for $10,000 at termination, which is less than its
original purchase price of $240,000 and above its book value of zero, it would
have experienced a taxable gain of $10,000 ($10,000 sale price
$0 book
value). Applying the 40% tax rate to the $10,000 gain, the firm would have
owed a tax of $4,000 (0.40
$10,000) on the sale of the old machine at the end
of year 5. Its after-tax sale proceeds from the old machine would have equalled
$6,000 ($10,000 sale price
$4,000 taxes). Substituting the appropriate values
into the format in Table 11.9 results in the terminal cash inflow of $49,000.

11.5 Summarizing the Relevant Cash Flows
The initial investment, operating cash inflows, and terminal cash flow together
represent a project’s relevant cash flows. These cash flows can be viewed as the
incremental after-tax cash flows attributable to the proposed project. They repre-
sent, in a cash flow sense, how much better or worse off the firm will be if it
chooses to implement the proposal.
The relevant cash flows for Powell Corporation’s proposed replacement expendi-
ture can be shown graphically, on a time line. Note that because the new asset is
assumed to be sold at the end of its 5-year usable life, the year-6 incremental
operating cash inflow calculated in Table 11.8 has no relevance; the terminal cash
flow effectively replaces this value in the analysis.

CHAPTER 11
Capital Budgeting Cash Flows
447
Summary
FOCUS ON VALUE
A key responsibility of financial managers is to review and analyze proposed
investment decisions to make sure that the firm undertakes only those that con-
tribute positively to the value of the firm. Utilizing a variety of tools and tech-
niques, financial managers estimate the cash flows that a proposed investment
will generate and then apply decision techniques to assess the investment’s
impact on the firm’s value. The most difficult and important aspect of this cap-
ital budgeting process is developing good estimates of the relevant cash flows.
The relevant cash flows are the incremental after-tax cash flows resulting
from a proposed investment. These estimates represent the cash flow benefits
that are likely to accrue to the firm as a result of implementing the investment.
By applying to the cash flows decision techniques that capture the time value of
money and risk factors, the financial manager can estimate how the investment
will affect the firm’s share price. Consistent application of capital budgeting pro-
cedures to proposed long-term investments should therefore allow the firm to
maximize its stock price.
REVIEW OF LEARNING GOALS
Discuss the three major cash flow components. The three major cash
flow components of any project can include: (1) an initial investment, (2) oper-
ating cash inflows, and (3) terminal cash flow. The initial investment occurs at
time zero, the operating cash inflows occur during the project life, and the ter-
minal cash flow occurs at the end of the project.
Discuss relevant cash flows, expansion versus replacement decisions,
sunk costs and opportunity costs, and international capital budgeting. The rele-
vant cash flows for capital budgeting decisions are the initial investment, the
operating cash inflows, and the terminal cash flow. For replacement decisions,
these flows are the difference between the cash flows of the new asset and the
old asset. Expansion decisions are viewed as replacement decisions in which all
cash flows from the old asset are zero. When estimating relevant cash flows,
ignore sunk costs and include opportunity costs as cash outflows. In interna-
tional capital budgeting, currency risks and political risks can be minimized
through careful planning.
LG 2
LG 1

Calculate the initial investment associated with a proposed capital
expenditure. The initial investment is the initial outflow required, taking into
account the installed cost of the new asset, the after-tax proceeds from the sale
of the old asset, and any change in net working capital. The initial investment is
reduced by finding the after-tax proceeds from sale of the old asset. The book
value of an asset is used to determine the taxes owed as a result of its sale.
Either of two forms of taxable income—a gain or a loss—can result from sale of
an asset, depending on whether the asset is sold for (1) more than book value,
(2) book value, or (3) less than book value. The change in net working capital is
the difference between the change in current assets and the change in current lia-
bilities expected to accompany a given capital expenditure.
Discuss the tax implications associated with the sale of an old asset.
There is typically a tax implication from the sale of an old asset. The tax impli-
cation depends on the relationship between its sale price and book value and on
existing government tax rules. Generally, if the old asset is sold for an amount
greater than its book value, then the difference is subject to a capital gains tax,
and if the old asset is sold for an amount less than its book value, then the com-
pany is entitled to tax deduction equal to the difference.
Find the relevant operating cash inflows associated with a proposed cap-
ital expenditure. The operating cash inflows are the incremental after-tax cash
inflows expected to result from a project. The income statement format involves
adding depreciation back to net operating profit after taxes and gives the oper-
ating cash inflows, which are the same as operating cash flows (OCF), associ-
ated with the proposed and present projects. The relevant (incremental) cash
inflows for a replacement project are the difference between the operating cash
inflows of the proposed project and those of the present project.
Determine the terminal cash flow associated with a proposed capital
expenditure. The terminal cash flow represents the after-tax cash flow (exclusive
of operating cash inflows) that is expected from liquidation of a project. It is
calculated for replacement projects by finding the difference between the after-
tax proceeds from sale of the new and the old asset at termination and then
adjusting this difference for any change in net working capital. Sale price and
depreciation data are used to find the taxes and the after-tax sale proceeds on
the new and old assets. The change in net working capital typically represents
the reversion of any initial net working capital investment.

Book value, taxes, and initial investment
Irvin Enterprises is considering the pur-
chase of a new piece of equipment to replace the current equipment. The new equip-
ment costs $75,000 and requires $5,000 in installation costs. It will be depreciated
under MACRS using a 5-year recovery period. The old piece of equipment was pur-
chased 4 years ago for an installed cost of $50,000; it was being depreciated under
MACRS using a 5-year recovery period. The old equipment can be sold today for
$55,000 net of any removal or cleanup costs. As a result of the proposed replace-
ment, the firm’s investment in net working capital is expected to increase by
$15,000. The firm pays taxes at a rate of 40%. (Table 4.2 on page 117 contains the
applicable MACRS depreciation percentages.)

c. Find the initial investment associated with the proposed equipment replacement.
ST11–2
Determining relevant cash flows
A machine currently in use was originally pur-
chased 2 years ago for $40,000. The machine is being depreciated under MACRS
using a 5-year recovery period; it has 3 years of usable life remaining. The current
machine can be sold today to net $42,000 after removal and cleanup costs. A new
machine, using a 3-year MACRS recovery period, can be purchased at a price of
$140,000. It requires $10,000 to install and has a 3-year usable life. If the new
machine is acquired, the investment in accounts receivable will be expected to rise by
$10,000, the inventory investment will increase by $25,000, and accounts payable
will increase by $15,000. Earnings before depreciation, interest, and taxes are
expected to be $70,000 for each of the next 3 years with the old machine and to be
$120,000 in the first year and $130,000 in the second and third years with the new
machine. At the end of 3 years, the market value of the old machine will equal zero,
but the new machine could be sold to net $35,000 before taxes. The firm is subject
to a 40% tax rate. (Table 4.2 on page 117 contains the applicable MACRS deprecia-
tion percentages.)
a. Determine the initial investment associated with the proposed replacement 
decision.
b. Calculate the incremental operating cash inflows for years 1 to 4 associated with
the proposed replacement. (Note: Only depreciation cash flows must be consid-
ered in year 4.)
c. Calculate the terminal cash flow associated with the proposed replacement deci-
sion. (Note: This is at the end of year 3.)
d. Depict on a time line the relevant cash flows found in parts a, b, and c that are

Relevant cash flow and timeline depiction
For each of the following projects,
determine the relevant cash flows, and depict the cash flows on a time line.
a. A project that requires an initial investment of $120,000 and will generate
annual operating cash inflows of $25,000 for the next 18 years. In each of the
18 years, maintenance of the project will require a $5,000 cash outflow.
b. A new machine with an installed cost of $85,000. Sale of the old machine will
yield $30,000 after taxes. Operating cash inflows generated by the replacement
will exceed the operating cash inflows of the old machine by $20,000 in each

year of a 6-year period. At the end of year 6, liquidation of the new machine will
yield $20,000 after taxes, which is $10,000 greater than the after-tax proceeds
expected from the old machine had it been retained and liquidated at the end of
year 6.
c. An asset that requires an initial investment of $2 million and will yield annual
operating cash inflows of $300,000 for each of the next 10 years. Operating cash
outlays will be $20,000 for each year except year 6, when an overhaul requiring
an additional cash outlay of $500,000 will be required. The asset’s liquidation
value at the end of year 10 is expected to be zero.

Masters Golf Products, Inc., spent 3 years and
$1,000,000 to develop its new line of club heads to replace a line that is becoming
obsolete. To begin manufacturing them, the company will have to invest $1,800,000
in new equipment. The new clubs are expected to generate an increase in operating
cash inflows of $750,000 per year for the next 10 years. The company has deter-
mined that the existing line could be sold to a competitor for $250,000.
a. How should the $1,000,000 in development costs be classified?

Sunk costs and opportunity costs
Covol Industries is developing the relevant cash
flows associated with the proposed replacement of an existing machine tool with a
new, technologically advanced one. Given the following costs related to the pro-
posed project, explain whether each would be treated as a sunk cost or an
opportunity cost in developing the relevant cash flows associated with the proposed
replacement decision.
a. Covol would be able to use the same tooling, which had a book value of
$40,000, on the new machine tool as it had used on the old one.
LG 2

b. Covol would be able to use its existing computer system to develop programs for
operating the new machine tool. The old machine tool did not require these pro-
grams. Although the firm’s computer has excess capacity available, the capacity
could be leased to another firm for an annual fee of $17,000.
c. Covol would have to obtain additional floor space to accommodate the larger
new machine tool. The space that would be used is currently being leased to
another company for $10,000 per year.
d. Covol would use a small storage facility to store the increased output of the new
machine tool. The storage facility was built by Covol 3 years earlier at a cost of
$120,000. Because of its unique configuration and location, it is currently of no
use to either Covol or any other firm.
e. Covol would retain an existing overhead crane, which it had planned to sell for its
$180,000 market value. Although the crane was not needed with the old machine
tool, it would be used to position raw materials on the new machine tool.

Sunk and opportunity cash flows
Dave and Ann Stone have been living at their
present home for the past 6 years. During that time, they have replaced the water
heater for $375, have replaced the dishwasher for $599, and have had to make mis-
cellaneous repair and maintenance expenditures of approximately $1,500. They
have decided to move out and rent the house for $975 per month. Newspaper adver-
tising will cost $75. Dave and Ann intend to paint the interior of the home and
power-wash the exterior. They estimate that that will run about $900.
The house should be ready to rent after that. In reviewing the financial situa-
tion, Dave views all the expenditures as being relevant, and so he plans to net out
the estimated expenditures discussed above from the rental income.

costs? Explain the two concepts to them.
b. Which of the expenditures should be classified as sunk cash flows and which
should be viewed as opportunity cash flows?

Integrative—Determining relevant cash flows
Lombard Company is contemplating
the purchase of a new high-speed widget grinder to replace the existing grinder. The
existing grinder was purchased 2 years ago at an installed cost of $60,000; it was
being depreciated under MACRS using a 5-year recovery period. The existing
grinder is expected to have a usable life of 5 more years. The new grinder costs
$105,000 and requires $5,000 in installation costs; it has a 5-year usable life and
would be depreciated under MACRS using a 5-year recovery period. Lombard can
currently sell the existing grinder for $70,000 without incurring any removal or
cleanup costs. To support the increased business resulting from purchase of the new
grinder, accounts receivable would increase by $40,000, inventories by $30,000, and
accounts payable by $58,000. At the end of 5 years, the existing grinder would have
a market value of zero; the new grinder would be sold to net $29,000 after removal

Atlantic Drydock is considering
replacing an existing hoist with one of two newer, more efficient pieces of equip-
ment. The existing hoist is 3 years old, cost $32,000, and is being depreciated under
MACRS using a 5-year recovery period. Although the existing hoist has only 3 years
(years 4, 5, and 6) of depreciation remaining under MACRS, it has a remaining
usable life of 5 years. Hoist A, one of the two possible replacement hoists, costs
$40,000 to purchase and $8,000 to install. It has a 5-year usable life and will be
depreciated under MACRS using a 5-year recovery period. Hoist B costs $54,000 to
purchase and $6,000 to install. It also has a 5-year usable life and will be depreci-
ated under MACRS using a 5-year recovery period.
Increased investments in net working capital will accompany the decision to
acquire hoist A or hoist B. Purchase of hoist A would result in a $4,000 increase in
net working capital; hoist B would result in a $6,000 increase in net working capital.
The projected earnings before depreciation, interest, and taxes with each alternative
hoist and the existing hoist are given in the following table.

for $185,000 before taxes. It is 2 years old, cost $800,000 new, and has a $384,000
book value and a remaining useful life of 5 years. It was being depreciated under
MACRS using a 5-year recovery period (see Table 4.2 on page 117) and therefore
has the final 4 years of depreciation remaining. If it is held for 5 more years, the

Damon Corporation, a sports equipment manufacturer, has a machine currently in
use that was originally purchased 3 years ago for $120,000. The firm depreciates the
machine under MACRS using a 5-year recovery period. Once removal and cleanup
costs are taken into consideration, the expected net selling price for the present
machine will be $70,000.
Damon can buy a new machine for a net price of $160,000 (including installation
costs of $15,000). The proposed machine will be depreciated under MACRS using a
5-year recovery period. If the firm acquires the new machine, its working capital

needs will change—accounts receivable will increase $15,000, inventory will increase
$19,000, and accounts payable will increase $16,000.
Earnings before depreciation, interest, and taxes (EBDIT) for the present machine
are expected to be $95,000 for each of the successive 5 years. For the proposed
machine, the expected EBDIT for each of the next 5 years are $105,000, $110,000,
$120,000, $120,000, and $120,000, respectively. The corporate tax rate (T) for the
firm is 40%. (Table 4.2 on page 117 contains the applicable MACRS depreciation
percentages.)
Damon expects to be able to liquidate the proposed machine at the end of its 
5-year usable life for $24,000 (after paying removal and cleanup costs). The present
machine is expected to net $8,000 upon liquidation at the end of the same period.
Damon expects to recover its net working capital investment upon termination of the
project. The firm is subject to a tax rate of 40%.

ability of cash flows, how to compare projects with unequal lives, and
how to measure project returns when capital is being rationed.
INFORMATION SYSTEMS You need to understand how risk is incorpo-
rated into capital budgeting techniques and how those techniques may
be refined in the face of special circumstances, so as to design deci-
sion modules for use in analyzing proposed capital projects.
MANAGEMENT You need to understand behavioral approaches for
dealing with risk, including international risk, in capital budgeting deci-
sions; how to risk-adjust discount rates; how to refine capital budgeting
techniques when projects have unequal lives or when capital must be
rationed; and how to recognize real options embedded in capital 
projects.
MARKETING You need to understand how the risk of proposed proj-
ects is measured in capital budgeting, how projects with unequal lives
will be evaluated, how to recognize and treat real options embedded
in proposed projects, and how projects will be evaluated when capital
must be rationed.
OPERATIONS You need to understand how proposals for the acquisi-
tion of new equipment and plants will be evaluated by the firm’s deci-
sion makers, especially projects that are risky, have unequal lives, or
may need to be abandoned or slowed, or when capital is limited.
Risk is present in all long-term deci-
sions. When making personal finan-
cial decisions, you should consider risk in the decision-making process.
Simply put, you should demand higher returns for greater risk. Failing
to incorporate risk into your financial decision-making process will
likely result in poor decisions and reduced wealth.

Worst Case Scenario
O
n April 20, 2010, an explosion destroyed BP’s
Deepwater Horizon offshore oil rig, resulting in
the largest oil spill in U.S. history. As much as 2.5 mil-
lion gallons of oil spewed into the Gulf of Mexico
each day, eventually reaching the shoreline in several
states and causing serious harm to the environment.
Under pressure from the Obama administration, BP
agreed to establish a $20 billion fund to pay for spill-
related expenses such as clean-up costs and compen-
sation for lost income for individuals and businesses
directly harmed by the accident.
When managers undertake large investments, they often invest a tremendous amount of
time and money trying to understand the risks associated with these investments. In the case of
BP, an accident at a rig that cost $500 million to build cost the company more than $20 billion.
As news of the accident and subsequent spill evolved, BP’s stock price plunged, falling from 
$60 to less than $30 in just 7 weeks, wiping out more than $90 billion of the firm’s market 
capitalization.
This chapter focuses on the tools available to managers that help them better understand
the risks of major investments.

Risk and Refinements in Capital Budgeting

12.1 Introduction to Risk in Capital 
Budgeting
In our discussion of capital budgeting thus far, we have assumed that all invest-
ment projects have the same level of risk for the firm. In other words, we assumed
that all projects are equally risky, and the acceptance of any project would not
change the firm’s overall risk. In actuality, these situations are rare—projects are
not equally risky, and the acceptance of a project can affect the firm’s overall risk.
We begin this chapter by relaxing these assumptions and focusing on how man-
agers evaluate the risks of different projects. Naturally, we will utilize many of the
risk concepts developed in Chapter 8.
We continue the Bennett Company example from Chapter 10. The relevant
cash flows and NPVs for Bennett Company’s two mutually exclusive projects—
A and B—appear in Table 12.1.
In the following three sections, we use the basic risk concepts presented in
Chapter 8 to demonstrate behavioral approaches for dealing with risk, interna-
tional risk considerations, and the use of risk-adjusted discount rates to explicitly
recognize risk in the analysis of capital budgeting projects.
6 REVIEW QUESTION
12–1 Are most mutually exclusive capital budgeting projects equally risky?

12.2 Behavioral Approaches for Dealing with Risk
Behavioral approaches can be used to get a “feel” for the level of project risk,
whereas other approaches try to quantify and measure project risk. Here we
present a few behavioral approaches for dealing with risk in capital budgeting:
risk and cash inflows, scenario analysis, and simulation.
RISK AND CASH INFLOWS
In the context of capital budgeting, the term risk refers to the uncertainty sur-
rounding the cash flows that a project will generate. More formally, risk in cap-
ital budgeting is the degree of variability of cash flows. Projects with a broad
range of possible cash flows are more risky than projects that have a narrow
range of possible cash flows.
In many projects, risk stems almost entirely from the cash flows that a project
will generate several years in the future because the initial investment is generally
known with relative certainty. These cash flows, of course, derive from a number
of variables related to revenues, expenditures, and taxes. Examples include the
level of sales, the cost of raw materials, labor rates, utility costs, and tax rates. We
will concentrate on the risk in the cash flows, but remember that this risk actually
results from the interaction of these underlying variables. Therefore, to assess the
risk of a proposed capital expenditure, the analyst needs to evaluate the proba-
bility that the cash inflows will be large enough to produce a positive NPV.
Treadwell Tire Company, a tire retailer with a 10% cost of capital, is considering
investing in either of two mutually exclusive projects, A and B. Each requires a
$10,000 initial investment, and both are expected to provide constant annual
cash inflows over their 15-year lives. For either project to be acceptable, its NPV
must be greater than zero. Another way to say this is that the present value of the
annuity (that is, the project’s cash inflows) must be greater than the initial cash
outflow. If we let CF equal the annual cash inflow and let CF0 equal the initial
investment, the following condition must be met for projects with annuity cash
inflows, such as A and B, to be acceptable:1
(12.1)
By substituting 
years, and 
, we can find the
breakeven cash inflow—the minimum level of cash inflow necessary for
Treadwell’s projects to be acceptable.
Calculator Use
Recognizing that the initial investment (CF0) is the present value
(PV), we can use the calculator inputs shown at the left to find the breakeven
cash inflow (CF), which is an ordinary annuity (PMT).

B
The calculator and spreadsheet values indicate that, for the projects to be
acceptable, they must have annual cash inflows of at least $1,315. Given this
breakeven level of cash inflows, the risk of each project can be assessed by deter-
mining the probability that the project’s cash inflows will equal or exceed this
breakeven level. The various statistical techniques that would determine that prob-
ability are covered in more advanced courses.2 For now, we can simply assume that
such a statistical analysis results in the following:
Probability of 
Probability of 
Because project A is certain (100% probability) to have a positive net present
value, whereas there is only a 65% chance that project B will have a positive NPV,
project A seems less risky than project B. Of course, the expected level of annual
cash inflow and NPV associated with each project must be evaluated in view of
the firm’s risk preference before the preferred project is selected.
The example clearly identifies risk as it is related to the chance that a project
is acceptable, but it does not address the issue of cash flow variability. Even
though project B has a greater chance of loss than project A, it might result in
higher potential NPVs. Recall that it is the combination of risk and return that
determines value. Similarly, the worth of a capital expenditure and its impact on
the firm’s value must be viewed in light of both risk and return. The analyst must
therefore consider the variability of cash inflows and NPVs to assess project risk
and return fully.
SCENARIO ANALYSIS
Scenario analysis can be used to deal with project risk to capture the variability of
cash inflows and NPVs. Scenario analysis is a behavioral approach that uses sev-
eral possible alternative outcomes (scenarios), to obtain a sense of the variability
of returns, measured here by NPV. This technique is often useful in getting a feel
for the variability of return in response to changes in a key outcome. In capital

level managerial finance text.

budgeting, one of the most common scenario approaches is to estimate the NPVs
associated with pessimistic (worst), most likely (expected), and optimistic (best)
estimates of cash inflow. The range can be determined by subtracting the
pessimistic-outcome NPV from the optimistic-outcome NPV.
Continuing with Treadwell Tire Company, assume that the financial manager
created three scenarios for each project: pessimistic, most likely, and optimistic.
The cash inflows and resulting NPVs in each case are summarized in Table 12.2.
Comparing the ranges of cash inflows ($1,000 for project A and $4,000 for B)
and, more important, the ranges of NPVs ($7,606 for project A and $30,424 for
B) makes it clear that project A is less risky than project B. Given that both proj-
ects have the same most likely NPV of $5,212, the assumed risk-averse decision
maker will take project A because it has less risk (smaller NPV range) and no pos-
sibility of loss (all NPVs
$0).
The widespread availability of computers and spreadsheets has greatly
enhanced the use of scenario analysis because technology allows analysts to
quickly create a wide range of different scenarios.
SIMULATION
Simulation is a statistics-based behavioral approach that applies predetermined
probability distributions and random numbers to estimate risky outcomes. By
tying the various cash flow components together in a mathematical model and

repeating the process numerous times, the financial manager can develop a prob-
ability distribution of project returns.
Figure 12.1 presents a flowchart of the simulation of the net present value of
a project. The process of generating random numbers and using the probability
distributions for cash inflows and cash outflows enables the financial manager to
determine values for each of these variables. Substituting these values into the
mathematical model results in an NPV. By repeating this process perhaps a thou-
sand times, managers can create a probability distribution of net present
values.
Although Figure 12.1 simulates only gross cash inflows and cash outflows,
more sophisticated simulations using individual inflow and outflow components,
such as sales volume, sale price, raw material cost, labor cost, or maintenance
expense, are quite common. From the distribution of returns, the decision maker
can determine not only the expected value of the return but also the probability
of achieving or surpassing a given return. The use of computers has made the sim-
ulation approach feasible. Monte Carlo simulation programs, made popular by
widespread use of personal computers, are described in the nearby Focus on
Practice box.
The output of simulation provides an excellent basis for decision making,
because it enables the decision maker to view a continuum of risk–return trade-
offs rather than a single-point estimate.

The Monte Carlo Method: The Forecast 
Is for Less Uncertainty
Most capital budgeting
decisions involve some
degree of uncertainty. For example, a
company faces some degree of uncer-
tainty associated with the demand for a
new product. One method of accounting
for this uncertainty is to average the high-
est and the lowest prediction of sales.
However, such a method is flawed.
Producing the average of the expected
possible demand can lead to gross over-
production or gross underproduction, nei-
ther of which is as profitable as having
the right volume of production.
To combat uncertainty in the
decision-making process, some compa-
nies use a Monte Carlo simulation
program to model possible outcomes.
Developed by mathematicians in World
War II while working on the atomic
bomb, the Monte Carlo method was
not widely used until the advent of the
personal computer. A Monte Carlo 
simulation program randomly generates
values for uncertain variables over and
over to simulate a model. The simula-
tion then requires project practitioners
to develop low, high, and most likely
cost estimates along with correlation
coefficients. Once these inputs are
derived, the Monte Carlo program can
be run through just a few simulations,
or thousands, in just a few seconds.
A Monte Carlo program usually
builds a histogram of the results,
referred to as a frequency chart, for
each forecast or output cell that the user
wants to analyze. The program then
delivers a percentage certainty that a
particular forecast will fall within a
specified range, much like a weather
forecast. The program also has an opti-
mization feature that allows a project
manager with budget constraints to fig-
ure out which combination of possible

One of the problems with using a
Monte Carlo program is the difficulty of
establishing the correct input ranges for
the variables and determining the corre-
lation coefficients for those variables.
However, the work put into developing
the input for the program can often clar-
ify some uncertainty in a proposed proj-
ect. Although Monte Carlo simulation is
not the perfect answer to capital budget-
ing problems, it is another tool that cor-
porations, including ALCOA, Motorola,
RJR Nabisco, and Walt Disney, use to
manage risk and make more informed
business and strategic decisions.

12.3 International Risk Considerations
Although the basic techniques of capital budgeting are the same for multinational
companies (MNCs) as for purely domestic firms, firms that operate in several
countries face risks that are unique to the international arena. Two types of risk
are particularly important, exchange rate risk and political risk.
Exchange rate risk reflects the danger that an unexpected change in the
exchange rate between the dollar and the currency in which a project’s cash flows
are denominated will reduce the market value of that project’s cash flow. The
dollar value of future cash inflows can be dramatically altered if the local currency
depreciates against the dollar. In the short term, specific cash flows can be hedged

cash flows are denominated

that project’s cash flow.

by using financial instruments such as currency futures and options. Long-term
exchange rate risk can best be minimized by financing the project, in whole or in
part, in local currency.
Political risk is much harder to protect against. Firms that make invest-
ments abroad may find that the host-country government can limit the firm’s
ability to return profits back home. Governments can seize the firm’s assets or
otherwise interfere with a project’s operation. The difficulties of managing polit-
ical risk after the fact make it even more important that managers account for
political risks before making an investment. They can do so either by adjusting
a project’s expected cash inflows to account for the probability of political
interference or by using risk-adjusted discount rates (discussed later in this
chapter) in capital budgeting formulas. In general, it is much better to adjust
individual project cash flows for political risk subjectively than to use a blanket
adjustment for all projects.
In addition to unique risks that MNCs must face, several other special issues
are relevant only for international capital budgeting. One of these special issues is
taxes. Because only after-tax cash flows are relevant for capital budgeting, finan-
cial managers must carefully account for taxes paid to foreign governments on
profits earned within their borders. They must also assess the impact of these tax
payments on the parent company’s U.S. tax liability.
Another special issue in international capital budgeting is transfer pricing.
Much of the international trade involving MNCs is, in reality, simply the ship-
ment of goods and services from one of a parent company’s subsidiaries to
another subsidiary located abroad. The parent company therefore has great dis-
cretion in setting transfer prices, the prices that subsidiaries charge each other for
the goods and services traded between them. The widespread use of transfer
pricing in international trade makes capital budgeting in MNCs very difficult
unless the transfer prices that are used accurately reflect actual costs and incre-
mental cash flows.
Finally, MNCs often must approach international capital projects from a
strategic point of view, rather than from a strictly financial perspective. For
example, an MNC may feel compelled to invest in a country to ensure continued
access, even if the project itself may not have a positive net present value. This
motivation was important for Japanese automakers that set up assembly plants in
the United States in the early 1980s. For much the same reason, U.S. investment
in Europe surged during the years before the market integration of the European
Community in 1992. MNCs often invest in production facilities in the home
country of major rivals to deny these competitors an uncontested home market.
MNCs also may feel compelled to invest in certain industries or countries to
achieve a broad corporate objective such as completing a product line or diversi-
fying raw material sources, even when the project’s cash flows may not be suffi-
ciently profitable.

12.4 Risk-Adjusted Discount Rates
The approaches for dealing with risk that have been presented so far enable the
financial manager to get a “feel” for project risk. Unfortunately, they do not explic-
itly recognize project risk. We will now illustrate the most popular risk-adjustment
technique that employs the net present value (NPV) decision method. The NPV
decision rule of accepting only those projects with NPVs
$0 will continue to
hold. Close examination of the basic equation for NPV, Equation 10.1, should
make it clear that because the initial investment (CF0) is known with certainty, a
project’s risk is embodied in the present value of its cash inflows:
Two opportunities to adjust the present value of cash inflows for risk exist:
(1) The cash inflows (CFt) can be adjusted, or (2) the discount rate (r) can be
adjusted. Adjusting the cash inflows is highly subjective, so here we describe the
more popular process of adjusting the discount rate. In addition, we consider the
portfolio effects of project analysis as well as the practical aspects of the risk-
adjusted discount rate.
DETERMINING RISK-ADJUSTED DISCOUNT RATES (RADRS)
A popular approach for risk adjustment involves the use of risk-adjusted discount
rates (RADRs). This approach uses Equation 10.1 but employs a risk-adjusted
discount rate, as noted in the following expression:3
(12.2)
The risk-adjusted discount rate (RADR) is the rate of return that must be
earned on a given project to compensate the firm’s owners adequately—that is, to
maintain or improve the firm’s share price. The higher the risk of a project, the
higher the RADR, and therefore the lower the net present value for a given
stream of cash inflows.
Talor Namtig is considering investing $1,000 in either of two
stocks—A or B. She plans to hold the stock for exactly 5 years
and expects both stocks to pay $80 in annual end-of-year cash dividends. At the
end of year 5 she estimates that stock A can be sold to net $1,200 and stock B can
be sold to net $1,500. Talor has carefully researched the two stocks and feels that
although stock A has average risk, stock B is considerably riskier. Her research
indicates that she should earn an annual return on an average-risk stock of 11%.
Because stock B is considerably riskier, she will require a 14% return from it.

3. The risk-adjusted discount rate approach can be applied in using the internal rate of return as well as the net
present value. When the IRR is used, the risk-adjusted discount rate becomes the cutoff rate that must be exceeded
by the IRR for the project to be accepted. When NPV is used, the projected cash inflows are merely discounted at the
risk-adjusted discount rate.

Talor makes the following calculations to find the risk-adjusted net present values
(NPVs) for the two stocks:
Although Talor’s calculations indicate that both stock investments are acceptable
(NPVs
$0), on a risk-adjusted basis, she should invest in Stock B because it has
a higher NPV.
Because the logic underlying the use of RADRs is closely linked to the capital
asset pricing model (CAPM) developed in Chapter 8, here we review CAPM and
discuss its use in finding RADRs.
Review of CAPM
In Chapter 8, we used the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) to link the relevant
risk and return for all assets traded in efficient markets. In the development of the
CAPM, the total risk of an asset was defined as
(12.3)
For assets traded in an efficient market, the diversifiable risk, which results from
uncontrollable or random events, can be eliminated through diversification. The
relevant risk is therefore the nondiversifiable risk—the risk for which owners of
these assets are rewarded. Nondiversifiable risk for securities is commonly meas-
ured by using beta, which is an index of the degree of movement of an asset’s
return in response to a change in the market return.
Using beta, bj, to measure the relevant risk of any asset j, the CAPM is
(12.4)
where
In Chapter 8, we demonstrated that the required return on any asset could be deter-
mined by substituting values of RF, bj, and rm into the CAPM—Equation 12.4. Any
security that is expected to earn in excess of its required return would be accept-
able, and those that are expected to earn an inferior return would be rejected.
 rm = return on the market portfolio of assets
 bj = beta coefficient for asset j
 RF = risk-free rate of return
 rj = required return on asset j
rj = RF + 3bj * (rm - RF)4
Total risk = Nondiversifiable risk + Diversifiable risk

Using CAPM to Find RADRs
If we assume for a moment that real corporate assets such as computers, machine
tools, and special-purpose machinery are traded in efficient markets, the CAPM
can be redefined as noted in Equation 12.5:
(12.5)
The security market line (SML)—the graphical depiction of the CAPM—is shown
for Equation 12.5 in Figure 12.2. Any project having an IRR above the SML
would be acceptable, because its IRR would exceed the required return, rproject;
any project with an IRR below rproject would be rejected. In terms of NPV, any
project falling above the SML would have a positive NPV, and any project falling
below the SML would have a negative NPV.4
Figure 12.2 shows two projects, L and R. Project L has a beta, bL, and generates
an internal rate of return, IRRL. The required return for a project with risk bL is
rL. Because project L generates a return greater than that required (IRRL
rL),
project L is acceptable. Project L will have a positive NPV when its cash inflows
are discounted at its required return, rL. Project R, on the other hand, generates
an IRR below that required for its risk, bR (IRRR
rR). This project will have a
negative NPV when its cash inflows are discounted at its required return, rR.
Project R should be rejected.

4. As noted earlier, whenever the IRR is above the cost of capital or required return (IRR
r), the NPV is positive,
and whenever the IRR is below the cost of capital or required return (IRR
r), the NPV is negative. Because by def-
inition the IRR is the discount rate that causes NPV to equal zero and the IRR and NPV always agree on
accept–reject decisions, the relationship noted in Figure 12.2 logically follows.

APPLYING RADRS
Because the CAPM is based on an assumed efficient market, which does not
always exist for real corporate (nonfinancial) assets such as plant and equipment,
managers sometimes argue that the CAPM is not directly applicable in calcu-
lating RADRs. Instead, financial managers sometimes assess the total risk of a
project and use it to determine the risk-adjusted discount rate (RADR), which
can be used in Equation 12.2 to find the NPV.
To avoid damaging its market value, the firm must use the correct discount rate
to evaluate a project. The nearby Focus on Ethics box describes a real example of a
company that failed to recognize (or that ignored) certain risks associated with
their business operations. As a result, the firm experienced monetary sanctions. If a
firm fails to incorporate all relevant risks in its decision-making process, it may dis-
count a risky project’s cash inflows at too low a rate and accept the project. The
firm’s market price may drop later as investors recognize that the firm itself has
become more risky. Conversely, if the firm discounts a project’s cash inflows at too
high a rate, it will reject acceptable projects. Eventually the firm’s market price may
drop because investors who believe that the firm is being overly conservative will
sell their stock, putting downward pressure on the firm’s market value.
Unfortunately, there is no formal mechanism for linking total project risk to
the level of required return. As a result, most firms subjectively determine the
RADR by adjusting their existing required return. They adjust it up or down

focus on ETHICS
Ethics and the Cost of Capital
At the dawn of the new
millennium, the com-
pany formerly known as British Petroleum
was trying to reinvent itself. BP intro-
duced a new corporate logo, a green,
yellow, and white sunburst, which “sym-
bolized energy in all its dynamic forms.”
In their 2009 sustainability review, BP
defined sustainability as “the capacity to
endure as a group: by renewing assets;
creating and delivering better products
and services that meet the evolving
needs of society; attracting successive
generations of employees; contributing to
a sustainable environment; and retaining
the trust and support of our customers,
shareholders and the communities in
which we operate.”a
However, BP’s environmental track
record didn’t always support the image
the company was trying to portray. In
2005, a fire at BP’s Texas City Refinery
killed fifteen workers and injured many
more. The following year, BP shut down
their Prudhoe Bay oil field due to corro-
sion in an oil transit line that resulted in
an oil spill. BP was widely criticized for
these events, but that did not stop BP
from causing the largest oil spill in 
U.S. history.
The Deepwater Horizon accident
and subsequent oil spill had a signifi-
cant impact on BP’s cost of capital. By
June 2010, BP’s stock price was 50
percent below precrisis levels, and the
company’s bonds traded at levels com-
parable to junk-rated companies. Over
the course of a single week, when BP’s
“top kill” attempt to stop the leak
proved unsuccessful, the yield on the
company’s main 5-year dollar bond
jumped by 2 percent. The bond rating
agencies downgraded BP, although the
firm continued to possess one of the
highest investment grade credit ratings.
However, the rating agencies warned
that further downgrades could follow if
the crisis, and the expected costs, con-
tinued to escalate.

depending on whether the proposed project is more or less risky, respectively,
than the average risk of the firm. This CAPM-type of approach provides a
“rough estimate” of the project risk and required return because both the project
risk measure and the linkage between risk and required return are estimates.
Bennett Company wishes to use the risk-adjusted discount rate approach to
determine, according to NPV, whether to implement project A or project B. In
addition to the data presented in part A of Table 12.1, Bennett’s management
after much analysis subjectively assigned “risk indexes” of 1.6 to project A and
1.0 to project B. The risk index is merely a numerical scale used to classify project
risk: Higher index values are assigned to higher-risk projects, and vice versa. The
CAPM-type relationship used by the firm to link risk (measured by the risk
index) and the required return (RADR) is shown in the following table.
Management developed this relationship after analyzing CAPM and the risk–
return relationships of the projects that they considered and implemented during the
past few years.

Because project A is riskier than project B, its RADR of 14% is greater than
project B’s 11%. The net present value of each project, calculated using its
RADR, is found as shown on the time lines in Figure 12.3. The results clearly
show that project B is preferable, because its risk-adjusted NPV of $9,798 is
greater than the $6,063 risk-adjusted NPV for project A. As reflected by the
NPVs in part B of Table 12.1, if the discount rates were not adjusted for risk,
project A would be preferred to project B.
Calculator Use
We can again use the preprogrammed NPV function in a finan-
cial calculator to simplify the NPV calculation. The keystrokes for project A—
the annuity—typically are as shown at the left. The keystrokes for project B—
the mixed stream—are also shown at the left. The calculated NPVs for projects
A and B of $6,063 and $9,798, respectively, agree with those shown in
Figure 12.3.

The usefulness of risk-adjusted discount rates should now be clear. The real
difficulty lies in estimating project risk and linking it to the required return
(RADR).
PORTFOLIO EFFECTS
As noted in Chapter 8, because investors are not rewarded for taking diversifiable
risk, they should hold a diversified portfolio of securities. Because a business firm
can be viewed as a portfolio of assets, is it similarly important that the firm main-
tain a diversified portfolio of assets?
It seems logical that by holding a diversified portfolio the firm could reduce
the variability of its cash flows. By combining two projects with negatively corre-
lated cash inflows, the firm could reduce the combined cash inflow variability—
and therefore the risk.
Are firms rewarded for diversifying risk in this fashion? If they are, the value
of the firm could be enhanced through diversification into other lines of business.
Surprisingly, the value of the stock of firms whose shares are traded publicly in an
efficient marketplace is generally not affected by diversification. In other words,
diversification is not normally rewarded and therefore is generally not necessary.
Why are firms not rewarded for diversification? Because investors themselves
can diversify by holding securities in a variety of firms; they do not need the firm
to do it for them. And investors can diversify more readily—they can make trans-
actions more easily and at a lower cost because of the greater availability of infor-
mation and trading mechanisms.
Of course, if a firm acquires a new line of business and its cash flows tend to
respond more to changing economic conditions (that is, greater nondiversifiable
risk), greater returns would be expected. If, for the additional risk, the firm earned
a return in excess of that required (IRR
r), the value of the firm could be
enhanced. Also, other benefits, such as increased cash, greater borrowing capacity,
guaranteed availability of raw materials, and so forth, could result from and there-
fore justify diversification, in spite of any immediate impact on cash flow.
Although a strict theoretical view supports the use of a technique that relies
on the CAPM framework, the presence of market imperfections causes the
market for real corporate assets to be inefficient at least some of the time. The rel-
ative inefficiency of this market, coupled with difficulties associated with meas-
urement of nondiversifiable project risk and its relationship to return, tend to
favor the use of total risk to evaluate capital budgeting projects. Therefore, the
use of total risk as an approximation for the relevant risk does have widespread
practical appeal.
RADRS IN PRACTICE
In spite of the appeal of total risk, RADRs are often used in practice. Their pop-
ularity stems from two facts: (1) They are consistent with the general disposition
of financial decision makers toward rates of return, and (2) they are easily esti-
mated and applied. The first reason is clearly a matter of personal preference, but
the second is based on the computational convenience and well-developed proce-
dures involved in the use of RADRs.
In practice, firms often establish a number of risk classes, with an RADR
assigned to each. Like the CAPM-type risk–return relationship described earlier,
7
478
PART 5
Long-Term Investment Decisions

management develops the risk classes and RADRs based on both CAPM and the
risk–return behaviors of past projects. Each new project is then subjectively
placed in the appropriate risk class, and the corresponding RADR is used to eval-
uate it. This is sometimes done on a division-by-division basis, in which case each
division has its own set of risk classes and associated RADRs, similar to those for
Bennett Company in Table 12.3. The use of divisional costs of capital and associ-
ated risk classes enables a large multidivisional firm to incorporate differing
levels of divisional risk into the capital budgeting process and still recognize dif-
ferences in the levels of individual project risk.
Assume that the management of Bennett Company decided to use risk classes to
analyze projects and so placed each project in one of four risk classes according
to its perceived risk. The classes ranged from I for the lowest-risk projects to IV
for the highest-risk projects. Associated with each class was an RADR appro-
priate to the level of risk of projects in the class, as given in Table 12.3. Bennett
classified as lower-risk those projects that tend to involve routine replacement or
renewal activities; higher-risk projects involve expansion, often into new or unfa-
miliar activities.
The financial manager of Bennett has assigned project A to class III and
project B to class II. The cash flows for project A would be evaluated using a
14% RADR, and project B’s would be evaluated using a 10% RADR.5 The NPV
of project A at 14% was calculated in Figure 12.3 to be $6,063, and the NPV for
project B at a 10% RADR was shown in Table 12.1 to be $10,924. Clearly, with
RADRs based on the use of risk classes, project B is preferred over project A.

acceptance of the “average-risk” project.

5. Note that the 10 percent RADR for project B using the risk classes in Table 12.3 differs from the 11 percent
RADR used in the preceding example for project B. This difference is attributable to the less precise nature of the use
of risk classes.

As noted earlier, this result is contrary to the preferences shown in Table 12.1,
where differing risks of projects A and B were not taken into account.

12.5 Capital Budgeting Refinements
Refinements must often be made in the analysis of capital budgeting projects to
accommodate special circumstances. These adjustments permit the relaxation of
certain simplifying assumptions presented earlier. Three areas in which special
forms of analysis are frequently needed are (1) comparison of mutually exclusive
projects having unequal lives, (2) recognition of real options, and (3) capital
rationing caused by a binding budget constraint.
COMPARING PROJECTS WITH UNEQUAL LIVES
The financial manager must often select the best of a group of unequal-lived proj-
ects. If the projects are independent, the length of the project lives is not critical.
But when unequal-lived projects are mutually exclusive, the impact of differing
lives must be considered because the projects do not provide service over compa-
rable time periods. This is especially important when continuing service is needed
from the project under consideration. The discussions that follow assume that the
unequal-lived, mutually exclusive projects being compared are ongoing. If they
were not, the project with the highest NPV would be selected.
The Problem
A simple example will demonstrate the basic problem of noncomparability
caused by the need to select the best of a group of mutually exclusive projects
with differing usable lives.
The AT Company, a regional cable television company, is evaluating two proj-
ects, X and Y. The relevant cash flows for each project are given in the following
table. The applicable cost of capital for use in evaluating these equally risky proj-
ects is 10%.

Project Y
Ignoring the differences in project lives, we can see that both projects are
acceptable (both NPVs are greater than zero) and that project Y is preferred over
project X. If the projects were independent and only one could be accepted,
project Y—with the larger NPV—would be preferred. If the projects were mutu-
ally exclusive, their differing lives would have to be considered. Project Y pro-
vides 3 more years of service than project X.
The analysis in the preceding example is incomplete if the projects are mutu-
ally exclusive (which will be our assumption throughout the remaining discus-
sions). To compare these unequal-lived, mutually exclusive projects correctly, we

must consider the differing lives in the analysis; an incorrect decision could result
from simply using NPV to select the better project. Although a number of
approaches are available for dealing with unequal lives, here we present the most
efficient technique—the annualized net present value (ANPV) approach.
Annualized Net Present Value (ANPV) Approach
The annualized net present value (ANPV) approach6 converts the net present
value of unequal-lived, mutually exclusive projects into an equivalent annual
amount (in NPV terms) that can be used to select the best project.7 This net
present value based approach can be applied to unequal-lived, mutually exclusive
projects by using the following steps:
Step 1
Calculate the net present value of each project j, NPVj, over its life, nj,
using the appropriate cost of capital, r.
Step 2
Convert the NPVj into an annuity having life nj. That is, find an annuity
that has the same life and the same NPV as the project.
Step 3
Select the project that has the highest ANPV.
By using the AT Company data presented earlier for projects X and Y, we can
apply the three-step ANPV approach as follows:
Step 1
The net present values of projects X and Y discounted at 10%—as cal-
culated in the preceding example for a single purchase of each asset—are
Step 2
In this step, we want to convert the NPVs from Step 1 into annuities. For
project X, we are trying to find the answer to the question, what 3-year
annuity (equal to the life of project X) has a present value of $11,248
(the NPV of project X)? Likewise, for project Y we want to know what
6-year annuity has a present value of $18,985. Once we have these
values, we can determine which project, X or Y, delivers a higher annual
cash flow on a present value basis.
Calculator Use
The keystrokes required to find the ANPV on a financial calcu-
lator are identical to those demonstrated in Chapter 5 for finding the annual pay-
ments on an installment loan. These keystrokes are shown at the left for project
X and for project Y. The resulting ANPVs for projects X and Y are $4,534.74
and $4,365.59, respectively.
Spreadsheet Use
The annualized net present values of two projects with
unequal lives also can be compared as shown on the following Excel spreadsheet.
 NPVY = $19,013.27
 NPVX = $11,277.24

6. This approach is also called the “equivalent annual annuity (EAA)” or the “equivalent annual cost.” The term
annualized net present value (ANPV) is used here due to its descriptive clarity.
7. The theory underlying this as well as other approaches for comparing projects with unequal lives assumes that
each project can be replaced in the future for the same initial investment and that each will provide the same
expected future cash inflows. Although changing technology and inflation will affect the initial investment and
expected cash inflows, the lack of specific attention to them does not detract from the usefulness of this technique.

Reviewing the ANPVs calculated in Step 2, we can see that project X
would be preferred over project Y. Given that projects X and Y are
mutually exclusive, project X would be the recommended project
because it provides the higher annualized net present value.
RECOGNIZING REAL OPTIONS
The procedures described in Chapters 10 and 11 and thus far in this chapter sug-
gest that to make capital budgeting decisions, we must (1) estimate relevant cash
flows, (2) apply an appropriate decision technique such as NPV or IRR to those
cash flows, and (3) recognize and adjust the decision technique for project risk.
Although this traditional procedure is believed to yield good decisions, a more
strategic approach to these decisions has emerged in recent years. This more
modern view considers any real options—opportunities that are embedded in
capital projects (“real,” rather than financial, asset investments) that enable man-
agers to alter their cash flows and risk in a way that affects project acceptability
(NPV). Because these opportunities are more likely to exist in, and be more
important to, large “strategic” capital budgeting projects, they are sometimes
called strategic options.
Table 12.4 briefly describes some of the more common types of real
options—abandonment, flexibility, growth, and timing. It should be clear from
their descriptions that each of these types of options could be embedded in a cap-
ital budgeting decision and that explicit recognition of them would probably alter
the cash flow and risk of a project and change its NPV.
By explicitly recognizing these options when making capital budgeting deci-
sions, managers can make improved, more strategic decisions that consider in
advance the economic impact of certain contingent actions on project cash flow

and risk. The explicit recognition of real options embedded in capital budgeting
projects will cause the project’s strategic NPV to differ from its traditional NPV,
as indicated by Equation 12.7.
(12.7)
Application of this relationship is illustrated in the following example.
Assume that a strategic analysis of Bennett Company’s projects A and B (see cash
flows and NPVs in Table 12.1) finds no real options embedded in project A and
two real options embedded in project B. The two real options in project B are as
follows: (1) The project would have, during the first two years, some downtime
that would result in unused production capacity that could be used to perform
contract manufacturing for another firm, and (2) the project’s computerized con-
trol system could, with some modification, control two other machines, thereby
reducing labor cost, without affecting operation of the new project.
Bennett’s management estimated the NPV of the contract manufacturing over
the two years following implementation of project B to be $1,500 and the NPV of
the computer control sharing to be $2,000. Management felt there was a 60%
chance that the contract manufacturing option would be exercised and only a 30%
chance that the computer control sharing option would be exercised. The com-
bined value of these two real options would be the sum of their expected values:
 = $900 + $600 = $1,500
 Value of real options for project B = (0.60 * $1,500) + (0.30 * $2,000)
Example 12.9 3
NPVstrategic = NPVtraditional + Value of real options

PART 5
Long-Term Investment Decisions
Major Types of Real Options
Option type
Description
Abandonment option
The option to abandon or terminate a project prior to the end of its planned life. This option allows
management to avoid or minimize losses on projects that turn bad. Explicitly recognizing the
abandonment option when evaluating a project often increases its NPV.
Flexibility option
The option to incorporate flexibility into the firm’s operations, particularly production. It generally
includes the opportunity to design the production process to accept multiple inputs, use flexible
production technology to create a variety of outputs by reconfiguring the same plant and equipment,
and to purchase and retain excess capacity in capital-intensive industries subject to wide swings in
output demand and long lead time in building new capacity from scratch. Recognition of this option
embedded in a capital expenditure should increase the NPV of the project.
Growth option
The option to develop follow-on projects, expand markets, expand or retool plants, and so on, that
would not be possible without implementation of the project that is being evaluated. If a project being
considered has the measurable potential to open new doors if successful, then recognition of the cash
flows from such opportunities should be included in the initial decision process. Growth
opportunities embedded in a project often increase the NPV of the project in which they are
embedded.
Timing option
The option to determine when various actions with respect to a given project are taken. This option
recognizes the firm’s opportunity to delay acceptance of a project for one or more periods, to
accelerate or slow the process of implementing a project in response to new information, or to shut
down a project temporarily in response to changing product market conditions or competition. As in
the case of the other types of options, the explicit recognition of timing opportunities can improve the
NPV of a project that fails to recognize this option in an investment decision.
TABLE 12.4

Substituting the $1,500 real options value along with the traditional NPV of
$10,924 for project B (from Table 12.1) into Equation 12.7, we get the strategic
NPV for project B:
Bennett Company’s project B therefore has a strategic NPV of $12,424,
which is above its traditional NPV and now exceeds project A’s NPV of $11,071.
Clearly, recognition of project B’s real options improved its NPV (from $10,924
to $12,424) and causes it to be preferred over project A (NPV of $12,424 for
B
NPV of $11,071 for A), which has no real options embedded in it.
It is important to realize that the recognition of attractive real options when
determining NPV could cause an otherwise unacceptable project (NPVtraditional
$0)
to become acceptable (NPVstrategic
$0). The failure to recognize the value of
real options could therefore cause management to reject projects that are accept-
able. Although doing so requires more strategic thinking and analysis, it is impor-
tant for the financial manager to identify and incorporate real options in the NPV
process. The procedures for doing this efficiently are emerging, and the use of the
strategic NPV that incorporates real options is expected to become more com-
monplace in the future.
CAPITAL RATIONING
Firms commonly operate under capital rationing—they have more acceptable
independent projects than they can fund. In theory, capital rationing should not
exist. Firms should accept all projects that have positive NPVs (or IRRs
the
cost of capital). However, in practice, most firms operate under capital rationing.
Generally, firms attempt to isolate and select the best acceptable projects subject
to a capital expenditure budget set by management. Research has found that
management internally imposes capital expenditure constraints to avoid what it
deems to be “excessive” levels of new financing, particularly debt. Although
failing to fund all acceptable independent projects is theoretically inconsistent
with the goal of maximizing owner wealth, here we will discuss capital rationing
procedures because they are widely used in practice.
The objective of capital rationing is to select the group of projects that pro-
vides the highest overall net present value and does not require more dollars than
are budgeted. As a prerequisite to capital rationing, the best of any mutually
exclusive projects must be chosen and placed in the group of independent proj-
ects. Two basic approaches to project selection under capital rationing are dis-
cussed here.
Internal Rate of Return Approach
The internal rate of return approach involves graphing project IRRs in
descending order against the total dollar investment. This graph is called the
investment opportunities schedule (IOS). By drawing the cost-of-capital line and
then imposing a budget constraint, the financial manager can determine the
group of acceptable projects. The problem with this technique is that it does not
guarantee the maximum dollar return to the firm. It merely provides a satisfac-
tory solution to capital-rationing problems.

The firm has a cost of capital of 10%. Figure 12.4 presents the IOS that results
from ranking the six projects in descending order on the basis of their IRRs.
According to the schedule, only projects B, C, and E should be accepted. Together
they will absorb $230,000 of the $250,000 budget. Projects A and F are accept-
able but cannot be chosen because of the budget constraint. Project D is not
worthy of consideration; its IRR is less than the firm’s 10% cost of capital.
The drawback of this approach is that there is no guarantee that the accept-
ance of projects B, C, and E will maximize total dollar returns and therefore
owners’ wealth.
Net Present Value Approach
The net present value approach is based on the use of present values to determine
the group of projects that will maximize owners’ wealth. It is implemented by
ranking projects on the basis of IRRs and then evaluating the present value of the
benefits from each potential project to determine the combination of projects

with the highest overall present value. This is the same as maximizing net present
value because the entire budget is viewed as the total initial investment. Any por-
tion of the firm’s budget that is not used does not increase the firm’s value. At
best, the unused money can be invested in marketable securities or returned to the
owners in the form of cash dividends. In either case, the wealth of the owners is
not likely to be enhanced.
The projects described in the preceding example are ranked in Table 12.5 on the
basis of IRRs. The present value of the cash inflows associated with the projects
is also included in the table. Projects B, C, and E, which together require
$230,000, yield a present value of $336,000. However, if projects B, C, and A
were implemented, the total budget of $250,000 would be used, and the present
value of the cash inflows would be $357,000. This is greater than the return
expected from selecting the projects on the basis of the highest IRRs.
Implementing B, C, and A is preferable because they maximize the present value
for the given budget. The firm’s objective is to use its budget to generate the
highest present value of inflows. Assuming that any unused portion of the budget
does not gain or lose money, the total NPV for projects B, C, and E would be
$106,000 ($336,000
$230,000), whereas the total NPV for projects B, C, and
A would be $107,000 ($357,000
$250,000). Selection of projects B, C, and A
will therefore maximize NPV.

Long-Term Investment Decisions
Summary
FOCUS ON VALUE
Not all capital budgeting projects have the same level of risk as the firm’s
existing portfolio of projects. The financial manager must adjust projects for dif-
ferences in risk when evaluating their acceptability. Without such an adjustment,
management could mistakenly accept projects that destroy shareholder value or
could reject projects that create shareholder value. To ensure that neither of
these outcomes occurs, the financial manager must make sure that only those
projects that create shareholder value are recommended.
Risk-adjusted discount rates (RADRs) provide a mechanism for adjusting the
discount rate so that it is consistent with the risk–return preferences of market
participants. Procedures for comparing projects with unequal lives, for explicitly
recognizing real options embedded in capital projects, and for selecting projects
under capital rationing enable the financial manager to refine the capital budg-
eting process further. These procedures, along with risk-adjustment techniques,
should enable the financial manager to make capital budgeting decisions that are
consistent with the firm’s goal of maximizing stock price.
REVIEW OF LEARNING GOALS
Understand the importance of recognizing risk in the analysis of capital
budgeting projects. The cash flows associated with capital budgeting projects
typically have different levels of risk, and the acceptance of a project generally
affects the firm’s overall risk. Thus it is important to incorporate risk considera-
tions in capital budgeting. Various behavioral approaches can be used to get a
“feel” for the level of project risk. Other approaches explicitly recognize project
risk in the analysis of capital budgeting projects.
Discuss risk and cash inflows, scenario analysis, and simulation as behav-
ioral approaches for dealing with risk. Risk in capital budgeting is the degree of
variability of cash flows, which for conventional capital budgeting projects stems
almost entirely from net cash flows. Finding the breakeven cash inflow and esti-
mating the probability that it will be realized make up one behavioral approach for
assessing capital budgeting risk. Scenario analysis is another behavioral approach
for capturing the variability of cash inflows and NPVs. Simulation is a statistically
based approach that results in a probability distribution of project returns.
Review the unique risks that multinational companies face. Although the
basic capital budgeting techniques are the same for multinational and purely
domestic companies, firms that operate in several countries must also deal with
exchange rate and political risks, tax law differences, transfer pricing, and
strategic issues.
Describe the determination and use of risk-adjusted discount rates
(RADRs), portfolio effects, and the practical aspects of RADRs. The risk of a
project whose initial investment is known with certainty is embodied in the present
value of its cash inflows, using NPV. Two opportunities to adjust the present value
of cash inflows for risk exist—adjust the cash inflows or adjust the discount rate.
LG 4
LG 3
LG 2
LG 1

Because adjusting the cash inflows is highly subjective, adjusting discount rates
is more popular. RADRs use a market-based adjustment of the discount rate to
calculate NPV. The RADR is closely linked to CAPM, but because real corpo-
rate assets are generally not traded in an efficient market the CAPM cannot be
applied directly to capital budgeting. Instead, firms develop some CAPM-type
relationship to link a project’s risk to its required return, which is used as the
discount rate. Often, for convenience, firms will rely on total risk as an approxi-
mation for relevant risk when estimating required project returns. RADRs are
commonly used in practice because decision makers find rates of return easy to
estimate and apply.
Select the best of a group of unequal-lived, mutually exclusive projects
using annualized net present values (ANPVs). The ANPV approach is the most
efficient method of comparing ongoing, mutually exclusive projects that have
unequal usable lives. It converts the NPV of each unequal-lived project into 
an equivalent annual amount—its ANPV. The ANPV can be calculated using
equations, a financial calculator, or a spreadsheet. The project with the highest
ANPV is best.
Explain the role of real options and the objective and procedures for
selecting projects under capital rationing. Real options are opportunities that are
embedded in capital projects and that allow managers to alter their cash flow
and risk in a way that affects project acceptability (NPV). By explicitly recog-
nizing real options, the financial manager can find a project’s strategic NPV.
Some of the more common types of real options are abandonment, flexibility,
growth, and timing options. The strategic NPV improves the quality of the cap-
ital budgeting decision.
Capital rationing exists when firms have more acceptable independent proj-
ects than they can fund. Capital rationing commonly occurs in practice. Its
objective is to select from all acceptable projects the group that provides the
highest overall net present value and does not require more dollars than are
budgeted. The two basic approaches for choosing projects under capital
rationing are the internal rate of return approach and the net present value
approach. The NPV approach better achieves the objective of using the budget
to generate the highest present value of inflows.

The chapter opener and the Focus on Ethics box on page 475 described some of
the consequences of the accident at BP’s Deepwater Horizon oil rig. The company
put up $20 billion to help pay for damages related to the oil spill, yet BP’s market
value declined by more than $90 billion. That means that the market assessed BP
an additional penalty of roughly $70 billion, above and beyond the direct costs
associated with the spill. Describe the effects that an increase in BP’s cost of cap-
ital could have on the market value of BP. Oil spills have happened before, so it is
plausible that engineers and analysts at BP could have imagined a worst-case sce-
nario in which a major spill occurred at one of the firm’s offshore rigs. How might
a thorough scenario analysis have influenced BP’s offshore drilling activities?

Birkenstock is considering an investment in a nylon-knitting machine. The machine
requires an initial investment of $25,000, has a 5-year life, and has no residual value
at the end of the 5 years. The company’s cost of capital is 12%. Known with less
certainty are the actual after-tax cash inflows for each of the 5 years. The company
has estimated expected cash inflows for three scenarios: pessimistic, most likely, and
optimistic. These expected cash inflows are listed in the following table. Calculate
the range for the NPV given each scenario.

NPV and ANPV decisions
Richard and Linda Butler decide that it is time to pur-
chase a high-definition (HD) television because the technology has improved and
prices have fallen over the past 3 years. From their research, they narrow their choices
to two sets, the Samsung 42-inch LCD with 1080p capability and the Sony 42-inch
LCD with 1080p features. The price of the Samsung is $2,350 and the Sony will cost
$2,700. They expect to keep the Samsung for 3 years; if they buy the more expensive
Sony unit, they will keep the Sony for 4 years. They expect to be able to sell the
Samsung for $400 by the end of 3 years; they expect they could sell the Sony for $350
at the end of year 4. Richard and Linda estimate the end-of-year entertainment bene-
fits (that is, not going to movies or events and watching at home) from the Samsung to
be $900 and for the Sony to be $1,000. Both sets can be viewed as quality units and
are equally risky purchases. They estimate their opportunity cost to be 9%.
The Butlers wish to choose the better alternative from a purely financial per-
spective. To perform this analysis they wish to do the following:
a. Determine the NPV of the Samsung HD LCD.

Real options and the strategic NPV
Jenny Rene, the CFO of Asor Products, Inc.,

methodology, she found the project unacceptable because
Before recommending rejection of the proposed project, she has decided to assess
whether there might be real options embedded in the firm’s cash flows. Her evalua-
tion uncovered three options:
Option 1: Abandonment—The project could be abandoned at the end of 3 years,
resulting in an addition to NPV of $1,200.
Option 2: Growth—If the projected outcomes occurred, an opportunity to
expand the firm’s product offerings further would become available at the end of
4 years. Exercise of this option is estimated to add $3,000 to the project’s NPV.
Option 3: Timing—Certain phases of the proposed project could be delayed if
market and competitive conditions caused the firm’s forecast revenues to develop
more slowly than planned. Such a delay in implementation at that point has an
NPV of $10,000.
Jenny estimated that there was a 25% chance that the abandonment option
would need to be exercised, a 30% chance that the growth option would be exer-
cised, and only a 10% chance that the implementation of certain phases of the
project would affect timing.

ETHICS PROBLEM
The Environmental Protection Agency sometimes imposes
penalties on firms that pollute the environment (see the Focus on Ethics box on page
475). But did you know that there is a legal market for pollution? A mechanism that has
been developed to limit excessive air pollution is to use carbon credits. Carbon credits
are a tradable permit scheme that allows businesses that cannot meet their greenhouse-
gas-emissions limits to purchase carbon credits from businesses that are below their
quota. By allowing credits to be bought and sold, a business for which reducing its emis-
sions would be expensive or prohibitive can pay another business to make the reduction
for it. Do you agree with this arrangement? How would you feel as an investor in a
company that utilizes carbon credits to legally exceed its pollution limits?

Integrative Case 5
Lasting Impressions Company
L
asting Impressions (LI) Company is a medium-sized commercial printer of pro-
motional advertising brochures, booklets, and other direct-mail pieces. The firm’s
major clients are ad agencies based in New York and Chicago. The typical job is
characterized by high quality and production runs of more than 50,000 units. LI has
not been able to compete effectively with larger printers because of its existing older,
inefficient presses. The firm is currently having problems cost-effectively meeting run
length requirements as well as meeting quality standards.
The general manager has proposed the purchase of one of two large, six-color
presses designed for long, high-quality runs. The purchase of a new press would
enable LI to reduce its cost of labor and therefore the price to the client, putting the
firm in a more competitive position. The key financial characteristics of the old press
and of the two proposed presses are summarized in what follows.
Old press
Originally purchased 3 years ago at an installed cost of $400,000, it
is being depreciated under MACRS using a 5-year recovery period. The old
press has a remaining economic life of 5 years. It can be sold today to net
$420,000 before taxes; if it is retained, it can be sold to net $150,000 before
taxes at the end of 5 years.
Press A
This highly automated press can be purchased for $830,000 and will
require $40,000 in installation costs. It will be depreciated under MACRS using
a 5-year recovery period. At the end of the 5 years, the machine could be sold to
net $400,000 before taxes. If this machine is acquired, it is anticipated that the
current account changes shown in the following table would result.
Press B
This press is not as sophisticated as press A. It costs $640,000 and
requires $20,000 in installation costs. It will be depreciated under MACRS
using a 5-year recovery period. At the end of 5 years, it can be sold to net
$330,000 before taxes. Acquisition of this press will have no effect on the firm’s
net working capital investment.
The firm estimates that its earnings before depreciation, interest, and taxes with
the old press and with press A or press B for each of the 5 years would be as shown
in Table 1 (see page 504). The firm is subject to a 40% tax rate. The firm’s cost of
capital, r, applicable to the proposed replacement is 14%.

TO DO
a. For each of the two proposed replacement presses, determine:

(2) Operating cash inflows. (Note: Be sure to consider the depreciation in 
year 6.)
(3) Terminal cash flow. (Note: This is at the end of year 5.)
b. Using the data developed in part a, find and depict on a time line the relevant
cash flow stream associated with each of the two proposed replacement presses,
assuming that each is terminated at the end of 5 years.
c. Using the data developed in part b, apply each of the following decision tech-
niques:
(1) Payback period. (Note: For year 5, use only the operating cash inflows—that
is, exclude terminal cash flow—when making this calculation.)
(2) Net present value (NPV).
(3) Internal rate of return (IRR).
d. Draw net present value profiles for the two replacement presses on the same set
of axes, and discuss conflicting rankings of the two presses, if any, resulting from
use of NPV and IRR decision techniques.
e. Recommend which, if either, of the presses the firm should acquire if the firm has
(1) unlimited funds or (2) capital rationing.
f.
What is the impact on your recommendation of the fact that the operating cash
inflows associated with press A are characterized as very risky in contrast to the
low-risk operating cash inflows of press B?

INTEGRATIVE CASE 6 O’Grady Apparel Company
Chapters in This Part
T
he last three chapters focused on how firms should invest money, but those chapters
were silent on where firms obtained the money to invest in the first place. In the
next two chapters, we examine firms’ long-term financial decisions. Broadly speaking,
these chapters focus on the trade-offs associated with different sources of investment
capital.
Chapter 13 looks at the firm’s most basic long-term financial decision—whether to
raise money by selling stock (equity) or by borrowing money (debt). A firm’s mix of
debt and equity financing is called its capital structure. Some firms choose a capital
structure that contains no debt at all, while other firms rely more heavily on debt
financing than on equity. The capital structure choice is extremely important because
how much debt a firm uses influences the returns that a firm can provide to its investors
as well as the risks associated with those returns. More debt generally means higher
returns but also higher risks. Chapter 13 illustrates how firms balance that trade-off.
Chapter 14 focuses on payout policy. Payout policy refers to the decisions that firms
make about whether and how to distribute cash to shareholders via dividends and
share repurchases. We can make a similar observation about payout policy that we
made about capital structure. Some firms choose to distribute no cash at all, while
other firms pay billions in dividends and stock buybacks each year. Paying out cash is
tangible proof that a company is generating cash flow for its investors, but once firms
start paying dividends, any move to reduce dividends or to stop paying them
altogether will likely lead to a sharp reduction in the firm’s stock price. Chapter 14
explains the factors that firms consider when forming their payout policies.

Why This Chapter Matters to You
In your professional life
ACCOUNTING You need to understand how to calculate and analyze
operating and financial leverage and to be familiar with the tax and
earnings effects of various capital structures.
INFORMATION SYSTEMS You need to understand the types of capital
and what capital structure is because you will provide much of the
information needed in management’s determination of the best capital
structure for the firm.
MANAGEMENT You need to understand leverage so that you can con-
trol risk and magnify returns for the firm’s owners and to understand
capital structure theory so that you can make decisions about the firm’s
optimal capital structure.
MARKETING You need to understand breakeven analysis, which you
will use in pricing and product feasibility decisions.
OPERATIONS You need to understand the impact of fixed and variable
operating costs on the firm’s breakeven point and its operating
leverage because these costs will have a major impact on the firm’s risk
and return.
Like corporations, you routinely
incur debt, using both credit cards
for short-term needs and negotiated long-term loans. When you borrow
over the long term, you experience the benefits and consequences of
leverage. Also, the level of your outstanding debt relative to net worth
is conceptually the same as a firm’s capital structure. It reflects your
financial risk and affects the availability and cost of borrowing.

Trading Equity for Debt
A
s the broader U.S. stock market roared back to
life in 2009, shares in the biotechnology firm,
Genzyme, dropped 28 percent. Contamination prob-
lems at Genzyme’s main manufacturing facility
prompted the firm to stop production during the
cleanup, and that in turn led to production shortages of
some of the firms best-selling drugs. That performance
irked one of Genzyme’s largest shareholders, Carl
Icahn, who promptly launched a proxy fight to gain four seats on the company’s board of direc-
tors. In June 2010, Genzyme reached an agreement with Icahn giving his representatives two
seats on their board.
Just eight days later, Genzyme’s stock rose 3.7 percent on the announcement that the com-
pany would issue $1 billion in debt. Genzyme planned to use the proceeds from the issue,
along with $1 billion in cash reserves, to repurchase approximately 40 million shares of
common stock. That move represented a significant shift in the firm’s capital structure (that is, its
mix of debt and equity financing), a move that would put more cash in the hands of share-
holders and apply more pressure on Genzyme management to generate positive cash flow from
the business. With more of its financing coming from debt, Genzyme was adding financial
leverage to its business, meaning that if the firm succeeds in selling its products, the returns to
shareholders will be magnified. However, if Genzyme instead experiences further declines in its
business, paying back the debt may prove to be difficult, and returns to shareholders will suffer
as a result.

PART 6
Long-Term Financial Decisions
13.1 Leverage
Leverage refers to the effects that fixed costs have on the returns that shareholders
earn. By “fixed costs” we mean costs that do not rise and fall with changes in a
firm’s sales. Firms have to pay these fixed costs whether business conditions are
good or bad. These fixed costs may be operating costs, such as the costs incurred
by purchasing and operating plant and equipment, or they may be financial costs,
such as the fixed costs of making debt payments. Generally, leverage magnifies
both returns and risks. A firm with more leverage may earn higher returns on
average than a firm with less leverage, but the returns on the more leveraged firm
will also be more volatile.
Many business risks are out of the control of managers, but not the risks
associated with leverage. Managers can limit the impact of leverage by adopting
strategies that rely more heavily on variable costs than on fixed costs. For
example, a basic choice that many firms confront is whether to make their own
products or to outsource manufacturing to another firm. A company that does its
own manufacturing may invest billions in factories around the world. These fac-
tories generate costs whether they are running or not. In contrast, a company that
outsources production can completely eliminate its manufacturing costs simply
by not placing orders. Costs for a firm like this are more variable and will gener-
ally rise and fall as demand warrants.
In the same way, managers can influence leverage in their decisions about
how the company raises money to operate. The amount of leverage in the firm’s
capital structure—the mix of long-term debt and equity maintained by the firm—
can significantly affect its value by affecting return and risk. The more debt a firm
issues, the higher are its debt repayment costs, and those costs must be paid
regardless of how the firm’s products are selling. Because leverage can have such
a large impact on a firm, the financial manager must understand how to measure
and evaluate leverage, particularly when making capital structure decisions.
Table 13.1 uses an income statement to highlight where different sources of
leverage come from.

• Operating leverage is concerned with the relationship between the firm’s sales
revenue and its earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) or operating profits.
When costs of operations (such as cost of goods sold and operating expenses) are
largely fixed, small changes in revenue will lead to much larger changes in EBIT.
• Financial leverage is concerned with the relationship between the firm’s EBIT
and its common stock earnings per share (EPS). On the income statement, you
can see that the deductions taken from EBIT to get to EPS include interest,
taxes, and preferred dividends. Taxes are clearly variable, rising and falling
with the firm’s profits, but interest expense and preferred dividends are usu-
ally fixed. When these fixed items are large (that is, when the firm has a lot of
financial leverage), small changes in EBIT produce larger changes in EPS.
• Total leverage is the combined effect of operating and financial leverage. It is
concerned with the relationship between the firm’s sales revenue and EPS.
We will examine the three types of leverage concepts in detail. First, though,
we will look at breakeven analysis, which lays the foundation for leverage con-
cepts by demonstrating the effects of fixed costs on the firm’s operations.
BREAKEVEN ANALYSIS
Firms use breakeven analysis, also called cost-volume-profit analysis, (1) to deter-
mine the level of operations necessary to cover all costs and (2) to evaluate the
profitability associated with various levels of sales. The firm’s operating
breakeven point is the level of sales necessary to cover all operating costs. At that
point, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) equals $0.1
The first step in finding the operating breakeven point is to divide the cost of
goods sold and operating expenses into fixed and variable operating costs. Fixed
costs are costs that the firm must pay in a given period regardless of the sales
volume achieved during that period. These costs are typically contractual; rent,
for example, is a fixed cost. Because fixed costs do not vary with sales, we typi-
cally measure them relative to time. For example, we would typically measure
rent as the amount due per month. Variable costs vary directly with sales volume.
Shipping costs, for example, are a variable cost.2 We typically measure variable
costs in dollars per unit sold.
Algebraic Approach
Using the following variables, we can recast the operating portion of the firm’s
income statement given in Table 13.1 into the algebraic representation shown in
Table 13.2.
VC = variable operating cost per unit
FC = fixed operating cost per period
Q = sales quantity in units
P = sale price per unit
CHAPTER 13
Leverage and Capital Structure

1. Quite often, the breakeven point is calculated so that it represents the point at which all costs—both operating
and financial—are covered. For now, we focus on the operating breakeven point as a way to introduce the concept
of operating leverage. We will discuss financial leverage later.
2. Some costs, commonly called semifixed or semivariable, are partly fixed and partly variable. An example is sales
commissions that are fixed for a certain volume of sales and then increase to higher levels for higher volumes. For
convenience and clarity, we assume that all costs can be classified as either fixed or variable.

Rewriting the algebraic calculations in Table 13.2 as a formula for earnings
before interest and taxes yields Equation 13.1:
(13.1)
Simplifying Equation 13.1 yields:
(13.2)
As noted above, the operating breakeven point is the level of sales at which all
fixed and variable operating costs are covered—the level at which EBIT equals
$0. Setting EBIT equal to $0 and solving Equation 13.2 for Q yields:
(13.3)
Q is the firm’s operating breakeven point.3
Assume that Cheryl’s Posters, a small poster retailer, has fixed operating costs of
$2,500. Its sale price is $10 per poster, and its variable operating cost is $5 per
poster. Applying Equation 13.3 to these data yields:
At sales of 500 units, the firm’s EBIT should just equal $0. The firm will have
positive EBIT for sales greater than 500 units and negative EBIT, or a loss, for
sales less than 500 units. We can confirm this by substituting values above and
below 500 units, along with the other values given, into Equation 13.1.
Q =
$2,500
$10 - $5 = $2,500

3. Because the firm is assumed to be a single-product firm, its operating breakeven point is found in terms of unit
sales, Q. For multiproduct firms, the operating breakeven point is generally found in terms of dollar sales, S. This is
done by substituting the contribution margin, which is 100 percent minus total variable operating costs as a per-
centage of total sales, denoted VC%, into the denominator of Equation 13.3. The result is Equation 13.3a:

Graphical Approach
Figure 13.1 presents in graphical form the breakeven analysis of the data in the
preceding example. The firm’s operating breakeven point is the point at which its
total operating cost—the sum of its fixed and variable operating costs—equals
sales revenue. At this point, EBIT equals $0. The figure shows that for sales
below 500 units, total operating cost exceeds sales revenue, and EBIT is less than
$0 (a loss). For sales above the breakeven point of 500 units, sales revenue
exceeds total operating cost, and EBIT is greater than $0.
Changing Costs and the Operating Breakeven Point
A firm’s operating breakeven point is sensitive to a number of variables: fixed
operating cost (FC), the sale price per unit (P), and the variable operating cost per
unit (VC). Refer to Equation 13.3 to see how increases or decreases in these vari-
ables affect the breakeven point. The sensitivity of the breakeven sales volume
(Q) to an increase in each of these variables is summarized in Table 13.3. As

might be expected, an increase in cost (FC or VC) tends to increase the operating
breakeven point, whereas an increase in the sale price per unit (P) decreases the
operating breakeven point.
Assume that Cheryl’s Posters wishes to evaluate the impact of several options: 
(1) increasing fixed operating costs to $3,000, (2) increasing the sale price per
unit to $12.50, (3) increasing the variable operating cost per unit to $7.50, and
(4) simultaneously implementing all three of these changes. Substituting the
appropriate data into Equation 13.3 yields the following results:
Comparing the resulting operating breakeven points to the initial value of 500
units, we can see that the cost increases (actions 1 and 3) raise the breakeven
point, whereas the revenue increase (action 2) lowers the breakeven point. The
combined effect of increasing all three variables (action 4) also results in an
increased operating breakeven point.
Rick Polo is considering having a new fuel-saving device
installed in his car. The installed cost of the device is $240 paid
up front, plus a monthly fee of $15. He can terminate use of the device any time
without penalty. Rick estimates that the device will reduce his average monthly
gas consumption by 20%, which, assuming no change in his monthly mileage,
translates into a savings of about $28 per month. He is planning to keep the car
for 2 more years and wishes to determine whether he should have the device
installed in his car.
To assess the financial feasibility of purchasing the device, Rick calculates
the number of months it will take for him to break even. Letting the installed
cost of $240 represent the fixed cost (FC), the monthly savings of $28 repre-
sent the benefit (P), and the monthly fee of $15 represent the variable cost
(VC), and substituting these values into the breakeven point equation,
Equation 13.3, we get:
Because the fuel-saving device pays itself back in 18.5 months, which is less than
the 24 months that Rick is planning to continue owning the car, he should have
the fuel-saving device installed in his car.
= 18.5 months
Breakeven point (in months) = $240 , ($28 - $15) = $240 , $13

PART 6
Long-Term Financial Decisions

OPERATING LEVERAGE
Operating leverage results from the existence of fixed costs that the firm must pay
to operate. Using the structure presented in Table 13.2, we can define operating
leverage as the use of fixed operating costs to magnify the effects of changes in
sales on the firm’s earnings before interest and taxes.
Using the data for Cheryl’s Posters (sale price, P
$10 per unit; variable oper-
ating cost, VC
$5 per unit; fixed operating cost, FC
$2,500), Figure 13.2
presents the operating breakeven graph originally shown in Figure 13.1. The
additional notations on the graph indicate that as the firm’s sales increase from
1,000 to 1,500 units (Q1 to Q2), its EBIT increases from $2,500 to $5,000 (EBIT1
to EBIT2). In other words, a 50% increase in sales (1,000 to 1,500 units) results
in a 100% increase in EBIT ($2,500 to $5,000). Table 13.4 includes the data for
Figure 13.2 as well as relevant data for a 500-unit sales level. We can illustrate
two cases using the 1,000-unit sales level as a reference point.
Case 1 A 50% increase in sales (from 1,000 to 1,500 units) results in a 100%
increase in earnings before interest and taxes (from $2,500 to $5,000).
Case 2 A 50% decrease in sales (from 1,000 to 500 units) results in a 100%
decrease in earnings before interest and taxes (from $2,500 to $0).
From the preceding example, we see that operating leverage works in both
directions. When a firm has fixed operating costs, operating leverage is present.

An increase in sales results in a more-than-proportional increase in EBIT; a
decrease in sales results in a more-than-proportional decrease in EBIT.
Measuring the Degree of Operating Leverage (DOL)
The degree of operating leverage (DOL) is a numerical measure of the firm’s
operating leverage. It can be derived using the following equation:4
(13.4)
Whenever the percentage change in EBIT resulting from a given percentage
change in sales is greater than the percentage change in sales, operating leverage
exists. This means that as long as DOL is greater than 1, there is operating
leverage.
Applying Equation 13.4 to cases 1 and 2 in Table 13.4 yields the following results:
Case 1:
Case 2:
Because the result is greater than 1, operating leverage exists. For a given base
level of sales, the higher the value resulting from applying Equation 13.4, the
greater the degree of operating leverage.

4. The degree of operating leverage also depends on the base level of sales used as a point of reference. The closer the
base sales level used is to the operating breakeven point, the greater the operating leverage. Comparison of the
degree of operating leverage of two firms is valid only when the same base level of sales is used for both firms.

A more direct formula for calculating the degree of operating leverage at a

into Equation
13.5 yields the following result:
The use of the formula results in the same value for DOL (2.0) as that found by
using Table 13.4 and Equation 13.4.6

maker Adobe.
DOL at 1,000 units =

5. Technically, the formula for DOL given in Equation 13.5 should include absolute value signs because it is possible
to get a negative DOL when the EBIT for the base sales level is negative. Because we assume that the EBIT for the
base level of sales is positive, we do not use the absolute value signs.
6. When total revenue in dollars from sales—instead of unit sales—is available, the following equation, in which

PART 6
Long-Term Financial Decisions
TABLE 13.5
Fixed Costs and Operating Leverage
Changes in fixed operating costs affect operating leverage significantly. Firms
sometimes can alter the mix of fixed and variable costs in their operations. For
example, a firm could make fixed-dollar lease payments rather than payments
equal to a specified percentage of sales. Or it could compensate sales representa-
tives with a fixed salary and bonus rather than on a pure percent-of-sales com-
mission basis. The effects of changes in fixed operating costs on operating
leverage can best be illustrated by continuing our example.
Assume that Cheryl’s Posters exchanges a portion of its variable operating costs
for fixed operating costs by eliminating sales commissions and increasing sales
salaries. This exchange results in a reduction in the variable operating cost per
unit from $5 to $4.50 and an increase in the fixed operating costs from $2,500 to
$3,000. Table 13.5 presents an analysis like that in Table 13.4, but using the new
costs. Although the EBIT of $2,500 at the 1,000-unit sales level is the same as
before the shift in operating cost structure, Table 13.5 shows that the firm has
increased its operating leverage by shifting to greater fixed operating costs.
With the substitution of the appropriate values into Equation 13.5, the
degree of operating leverage at the 1,000-unit base level of sales becomes
Comparing this value to the DOL of 2.0 before the shift to more fixed costs
makes it clear that the higher the firm’s fixed operating costs relative to variable
operating costs, the greater the degree of operating leverage.
FINANCIAL LEVERAGE
Financial leverage results from the presence of fixed financial costs that the firm
must pay. Using the framework in Table 13.1, we can define financial leverage as
DOL at 1,000 units =
1,000 * ($10 - $4.50)
1,000 * ($10 - $4.50) - $3,000 = $5,500
$2,500 = 2.2

the use of fixed financial costs to magnify the effects of changes in earnings before
interest and taxes on the firm’s earnings per share. The two most common fixed
financial costs are (1) interest on debt and (2) preferred stock dividends. These
charges must be paid regardless of the amount of EBIT available to pay them.7
Chen Foods, a small Asian food company, expects EBIT of $10,000 in the current
year. It has a $20,000 bond with a 10% (annual) coupon rate of interest and an
issue of 600 shares of $4 (annual dividend per share) preferred stock outstanding.
It also has 1,000 shares of common stock outstanding. The annual interest on the
bond issue is $2,000 (0.10
$20,000). The annual dividends on the preferred
stock are $2,400 ($4.00/share
600 shares). Table 13.6 presents the earnings
per share (EPS) corresponding to levels of EBIT of $6,000, $10,000, and
$14,000, assuming that the firm is in the 40% tax bracket. The table illustrates
two situations:
Case 1 A 40% increase in EBIT (from $10,000 to $14,000) results in a 100%
increase in earnings per share (from $2.40 to $4.80).
Case 2 A 40% decrease in EBIT (from $10,000 to $6,000) results in a 100%
decrease in earnings per share (from $2.40 to $0).

7. Although a firm’s board of directors can elect to stop paying preferred stock dividends, the firm typically cannot
pay dividends on common stock until the preferred shareholders receive all of the dividends that they are owed.
Although failure to pay preferred dividends cannot force the firm into bankruptcy, it increases the common stock-
holders’ risk because they cannot receive dividends until the claims of preferred stockholders are satisfied.

The effect of financial leverage is such that an increase in the firm’s EBIT
results in a more-than-proportional increase in the firm’s earnings per share,
whereas a decrease in the firm’s EBIT results in a more-than-proportional
decrease in EPS.
Measuring the Degree of Financial Leverage (DFL)
The degree of financial leverage (DFL) is a numerical measure of the firm’s financial
leverage. Computing it is much like computing the degree of operating leverage.
The following equation presents one approach for obtaining the DFL.8
(13.6)
Whenever the percentage change in EPS resulting from a given percentage change
in EBIT is greater than the percentage change in EBIT, financial leverage exists.
This means that whenever DFL is greater than 1, there is financial leverage.
Applying Equation 13.6 to cases 1 and 2 in Table 13.6 yields
Case 1:
Case 2:
In both cases, the quotient is greater than 1, so financial leverage exists. The
higher this value is, the greater the degree of financial leverage.
Shanta and Ravi Shandra, a married couple with no children,
wish to assess the impact of additional long-term borrowing on
their degree of financial leverage (DFL). The Shandras currently have $4,200
available after meeting all of their monthly living (operating) expenses, before
making monthly loan payments. They currently have monthly loan payment obli-
gations of $1,700 and are considering the purchase of a new car, which would
result in a $500 per month increase (to $2,200) in their total monthly loan pay-
ments. Because a large portion of Ravi’s monthly income represents commissions,
the Shandras feel that the $4,200 per month currently available for making loan
payments could vary by 20% above or below that amount.
To assess the potential impact of the additional borrowing on their financial
leverage, the Shandras calculate their DFL for both their current ($1,700) and
proposed ($2,200) loan payments as follows, using the currently available
$4,200 as a base and a 20% change.

8. This approach is valid only when the same base level of EBIT is used to calculate and compare these values. In
other words, the base level of EBIT must be held constant to compare the financial leverage associated with different
levels of fixed financial costs.
degree of financial leverage
(DFL)
The numerical measure of the
firm’s financial leverage.

Based on their calculations, the amount the Shandras will have available after
loan payments with their current debt changes by 1.68% for every 1% change in
the amount they will have available for making the loan payments. This is con-
siderably less responsive—and therefore less risky—than the 2.10% change in the
amount available after loan payments for each 1% change in the amount avail-
able for making loan payments with the proposed additional $500 in monthly
debt payments. Although it appears that the Shandras can afford the additional
loan payments, they must decide if, given the variability of Ravi’s income, they
feel comfortable with the increased financial leverage and risk.
A more direct formula for calculating the degree of financial leverage at a
base level of EBIT is given by Equation 13.7, where the notation from Table 13.6
is used.9 Note that in the denominator the term 1/(1
T) converts the after-tax
preferred stock dividend to a before-tax amount for consistency with the other
terms in the equation.
(13.7)
Substituting EBIT
$10,000, I
$2,000, PD
$2,400, and the tax rate 
(T

for calculating the degree of financial leverage than the approach illustrated using
Table 13.6 and Equation 13.6.

9. By using the formula for DFL in Equation 13.7, it is possible to get a negative value for the DFL if the EPS for the
base level of EBIT is negative. Rather than show absolute value signs in the equation, we instead assume that the
base-level EPS is positive.

TOTAL LEVERAGE
We also can assess the combined effect of operating and financial leverage on the
firm’s risk by using a framework similar to that used to develop the individual
concepts of leverage. This combined effect, or total leverage, can be defined as the
use of fixed costs, both operating and financial, to magnify the effects of changes
in sales on the firm’s earnings per share. Total leverage can therefore be viewed as
the total impact of the fixed costs in the firm’s operating and financial structure.
Cables Inc., a computer cable manufacturer, expects sales of 20,000 units at $5
per unit in the coming year and must meet the following obligations: variable
operating costs of $2 per unit, fixed operating costs of $10,000, interest of
$20,000, and preferred stock dividends of $12,000. The firm is in the 40% tax
bracket and has 5,000 shares of common stock outstanding. Table 13.7 presents
the levels of earnings per share associated with the expected sales of 20,000 units
and with sales of 30,000 units.
The table illustrates that as a result of a 50% increase in sales (from 20,000 to
30,000 units), the firm would experience a 300% increase in earnings per share
(from $1.20 to $4.80). Although it is not shown in the table, a 50% decrease in
sales would, conversely, result in a 300% decrease in earnings per share. The
linear nature of the leverage relationship accounts for the fact that sales changes of
equal magnitude in opposite directions result in EPS changes of equal magnitude
in the corresponding direction. At this point, it should be clear that whenever a

exist.
Measuring the Degree of Total Leverage (DTL)
The degree of total leverage (DTL) is a numerical measure of the firm’s total
leverage. It can be computed much like operating and financial leverage are com-
puted. The following equation presents one approach for measuring DTL:10
(13.8)
Whenever the percentage change in EPS resulting from a given percentage change
in sales is greater than the percentage change in sales, total leverage exists. This
means that as long as the DTL is greater than 1, there is total leverage.
Applying Equation 13.8 to the data in Table 13.7 yields
Because this result is greater than 1, total leverage exists. The higher the value is,
the greater the degree of total leverage.
A more direct formula for calculating the degree of total leverage at a given base
level of sales, Q, is given by Equation 13.9,11 which uses the same notation that
was presented earlier:

Substituting Q

10. This approach is valid only when the same base level of sales is used to calculate and compare these values. In
other words, the base level of sales must be held constant if we are to compare the total leverage associated with dif-
ferent levels of fixed costs.
11. By using the formula for DTL in Equation 13.9, it is possible to get a negative value for the DTL if the EPS for
the base level of sales is negative. For our purposes, rather than show absolute value signs in the equation, we
instead assume that the base-level EPS is positive.

firm’s total leverage.

Relationship of Operating, Financial, and Total Leverage
Total leverage reflects the combined impact of operating and financial leverage on
the firm. High operating leverage and high financial leverage will cause total
leverage to be high. The opposite will also be true. The relationship between oper-
ating leverage and financial leverage is multiplicative rather than additive. The rela-
tionship between the degree of total leverage (DTL) and the degrees of operating
leverage (DOL) and financial leverage (DFL) is given by Equation 13.10:
(13.10)
Substituting the values calculated for DOL and DFL, shown on the right-hand
side of Table 13.7, into Equation 13.10 yields
The resulting degree of total leverage is the same value that we calculated directly
in the preceding examples.

Repo 105
Lehman Brothers’ fall
was perhaps the most
stunning development of the financial
crisis. Dating back to the mid-1800s,
the firm had survived the Great
Depression and numerous recessions to
become a major player on Wall Street
and around the world. Lehman’s busi-
ness included investment banking,
sales, research and trading, investment
management, private equity, and pri-
vate banking. Lehman was also a
major player in the subprime mortgage
industry, which would ultimately lead to
the firm’s undoing.
In the years before the subprime
mortgage crisis, financial firms bor-
rowed heavily. Lehman was no excep-
tion. By early 2008, Lehman had $32
in debt for each $1 in equity. That
much leverage implied that a small
drop in the value of Lehman’s assets
could wipe out the firm.
Lehman’s exposure to the subprime
mortgage industry left it vulnerable 
during the crisis. As its financial health
deteriorated, Lehman used off–balance
sheet transactions to hide the extent of its
indebtednesses. The transactions, known
within Lehman as Repo 105s, were exe-
cuted near the end of each quarter, just
before Lehman filed its quarterly finan-
cial reports. In these repos, Lehman sold
some of its assets with an agreement to
buy them back (with interest) a few days
later. Lehman used the cash from the
asset sale to pay down other liabilities.
The Repo 105 transactions enabled
Lehman to reduce both total liabilities
and total assets and allowed the firm to
report lower leverage ratios. With the
start of a new quarter, Lehman would
unwind the transactions and restore the
liabilities to their balance sheet.
The effects of Lehman’s Repo 105
transactions were sizeable, allowing
the firm to briefly remove as much as
$50 billion in debt from its balance
sheet. Because Lehman did not detail
the Repo 105 transactions in their
financial statements, outsiders were
unaware of the transactions. Within
Lehman, concerns were raised over 
the Repo 105 program. The firm’s
Global Financial Controller, Martin
Kelly, warned of the “reputational 
risk” to Lehman if the public became
aware of the firm’s reliance on such
transactions.a
3 Assume that Lehman’s Repo 105
transactions fall within the limits
allowed by Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles as Lehman’s
management has argued. What are

CHAPTER 13
Leverage and Capital Structure

13.2 The Firm’s Capital Structure
Capital structure is one of the most complex areas of financial decision making
because of its interrelationship with other financial decision variables. Poor cap-
ital structure decisions can result in a high cost of capital, thereby lowering the
NPVs of projects and making more of them unacceptable. Effective capital struc-
ture decisions can lower the cost of capital, resulting in higher NPVs and more
acceptable projects—and thereby increasing the value of the firm.
TYPES OF CAPITAL
All of the items on the right-hand side of the firm’s balance sheet, excluding cur-
rent liabilities, are sources of capital. The following simplified balance sheet illus-
trates the basic breakdown of total capital into its two components, debt capital
and equity capital:
LG 3

    Preferred stock
    Common stock equity

        Retained earnings
Current liabilities

capital
The cost of debt is lower than the cost of other forms of financing. Lenders
demand relatively lower returns because they take the least risk of any contributors
of long-term capital. Lenders have a higher priority of claim against any earnings or
assets available for payment, and they can exert far greater legal pressure against
the company to make payment than can owners of preferred or common stock.
LG 4

The tax deductibility of interest payments also lowers the debt cost to the firm
substantially.
Unlike debt capital, which the firm must eventually repay, equity capital
remains invested in the firm indefinitely—it has no maturity date. The two basic
sources of equity capital are (1) preferred stock and (2) common stock equity, which
includes common stock and retained earnings. Common stock is typically the most
expensive form of equity, followed by retained earnings and then preferred stock.
Our concern here is the relationship between debt and equity capital. In general, the
more debt a firm uses, the greater will be the firm’s financial leverage. That leverage
makes the claims of common stockholders even more risky. In addition, a firm that
increases its use of leverage significantly can see its cost of debt rise as lenders begin
to worry about the firm’s ability to repay its debts. Whether the firm borrows very
little or a great deal, it is always true that the claims of common stockholders are
riskier than those of lenders, so the cost of equity always exceeds the cost of debt.
EXTERNAL ASSESSMENT OF CAPITAL STRUCTURE
We saw earlier that financial leverage results from the use of fixed-cost financing,
such as debt and preferred stock, to magnify return and risk. The amount of
leverage in the firm’s capital structure can affect its value by affecting return and
risk. Those outside the firm can make a rough assessment of capital structure by
using measures found in the firm’s financial statements. Some of these important
debt ratios were presented in Chapter 3. For example, a direct measure of the degree
of indebtedness is the debt ratio (total liabilities
total assets). The higher this ratio
is, the greater the relative amount of debt (or financial leverage) in the firm’s capital
structure. Measures of the firm’s ability to meet contractual payments associated
with debt include the times interest earned ratio (EBIT
interest) and the fixed-
payment coverage ratio (see page 78). These ratios provide indirect information on
financial leverage. Generally, the smaller these ratios, the greater the firm’s financial
leverage and the less able it is to meet payments as they come due.
The level of debt (financial leverage) that is acceptable for one industry or
line of business can be highly risky in another, because different industries and
lines of business have different operating characteristics. Table 13.8 presents the
debt and times interest earned ratios for selected industries and lines of business.
Significant industry differences can be seen in these data. Differences in debt posi-
tions are also likely to exist within an industry or line of business.
Those who lend to individuals, like lenders to corporations, typ-
ically use ratios to assess the applicant’s ability to meet the con-
tractual payments associated with the requested debt. The lender, after obtaining
information from a loan application and other sources, calculates ratios and com-
pares them to predetermined allowable values. Typically, if the applicant’s ratio
values are within the acceptable range, the lender will make the requested loan.
The best example of this process is a real estate mortgage loan application.
The mortgage lender usually invokes the following two requirements:
1. Monthly mortgage payments
25% to 30% of monthly gross (before-tax)
income
2. Total monthly installment payments (including the mortgage payment)
33%
to 38% of monthly gross (before-tax) income

Assume that the Loo family is applying for a mortgage loan. The family’s
monthly gross (before-tax) income is $5,380, and they currently have monthly
installment loan obligations that total $560. The $200,000 mortgage loan they
are applying for will require monthly payments of $1,400. The lender requires 
(1) the monthly mortgage payment to be less than 28% of monthly gross income
and (2) total monthly installment payments (including the mortgage payment) to
be less than 37% of monthly gross income. The lender calculates and evaluates
these ratios for the Loos, as shown below.
1. Mort. pay.
Gross income
$1,400
$5,380

28% maximum, therefore OK
2. Tot. instal.pay.
Gross income
($560
$1,400)
$5,380
$1,960
$5,380

Because the Loos’ ratios meet the lender’s standards, assuming they have ade-
quate funds for the down payment and meet other lender requirements, the Loos
will be granted the loan.
CAPITAL STRUCTURE OF NON–U.S. FIRMS
In general, non–U.S. companies have much higher degrees of indebtedness than
their U.S. counterparts. Most of the reasons relate to the fact that U.S. capital mar-
kets are more developed than those elsewhere and have played a greater role in
corporate financing than has been the case in other countries. In most European
countries and especially in Japan and other Pacific Rim nations, large commercial
banks are more actively involved in the financing of corporate activity than has

been true in the United States. Furthermore, in many of these countries, banks are
allowed to make large equity investments in nonfinancial corporations—a practice
prohibited for U.S. banks. Finally, share ownership tends to be more tightly con-
trolled among founding-family, institutional, and even public investors in Europe
and Asia than it is for most large U.S. corporations. Tight ownership enables owners
to understand the firm’s financial condition better, resulting in their willingness to
tolerate a higher degree of indebtedness.

PART 6
Long-Term Financial Decisions
Matter of fact
A
recent study of the use of long-term debt in 42 countries found that firms in Argentina used
more long-term debt than firms in any other country. Relative to their assets, firms in
Argentina used almost 60 percent more long-term debt than did U.S. companies. Indian firms
were heavy users of long-term debt as well. At the other end of the spectrum, companies from
Italy, Greece, and Poland used very little long-term debt. In those countries, firms used only about
40 percent as much long-term debt as did their U.S. counterparts.
Leverage around the World
On the other hand, similarities do exist between U.S. corporations and corpora-
tions in other countries. First, the same industry patterns of capital structure tend to
be found all around the world. For example, in nearly all countries, pharmaceutical
and other high-growth industrial firms tend to have lower debt ratios than do steel
companies, airlines, and electric utility companies. In part, this has to do with the
nature of assets held by these firms. High-growth firms whose main assets are intan-
gibles (such as patents and rights to intellectual property) tend to borrow less than
firms that have tangible assets that can be pledged as collateral for loans. Second, the
capital structures of the largest U.S.–based multinational companies, which have
access to capital markets around the world, typically resemble the capital structures
of multinational companies from other countries more than they resemble those of
smaller U.S. companies. In other words, in most countries there is a tendency for
larger firms to borrow more than smaller firms do. Third, companies that are riskier
and have more volatile income streams tend to borrow less, as do firms that are
highly profitable. Finally, the worldwide trend is away from reliance on banks for
financing and toward greater reliance on security issuance. Over time, the differ-
ences in the capital structures of U.S. and non–U.S. firms will probably lessen.
CAPITAL STRUCTURE THEORY
Research suggests that there is an optimal capital structure range. It is not yet
possible to provide financial managers with a precise methodology for deter-
mining a firm’s optimal capital structure. Nevertheless, financial theory does
offer help in understanding how a firm’s capital structure affects the firm’s value.
In 1958, Franco Modigliani and Merton H. Miller12 (commonly known as
“M and M”) demonstrated algebraically that, assuming perfect markets,13 the
12. Franco Modigliani and Merton H. Miller, “The Cost of Capital, Corporation Finance, and the Theory of
Investment,” American Economic Review (June 1958), pp. 261–297.
13. Perfect-market assumptions include (1) no taxes, (2) no brokerage or flotation costs for securities, (3) symmet-
rical information—investors and managers have the same information about the firm’s investment prospects, and 
(4) investor ability to borrow at the same rate as corporations.

capital structure that a firm chooses does not affect its value. Many researchers,
including M and M, have examined the effects of less restrictive assumptions on
the relationship between capital structure and the firm’s value. The result is a the-
oretical optimal capital structure based on balancing the benefits and costs of
debt financing. The major benefit of debt financing is the tax shield, which allows
interest payments to be deducted in calculating taxable income. The cost of debt
financing results from (1) the increased probability of bankruptcy caused by debt
obligations, (2) the agency costs of the lender’s constraining the firm’s actions,
and (3) the costs associated with managers having more information about the
firm’s prospects than do investors.
Tax Benefits
Allowing firms to deduct interest payments on debt when calculating taxable
income reduces the amount of the firm’s earnings paid in taxes, thereby making
more earnings available for bondholders and stockholders. The deductibility of
interest means the cost of debt, ri, to the firm is subsidized by the government.
Letting rd equal the before-tax cost of debt and letting T equal the tax rate, from
Chapter 9 (Equation 9.2), we have 
.
Probability of Bankruptcy
The chance that a firm will become bankrupt because of an inability to meet its
obligations as they come due depends largely on its levels of both business risk
and financial risk.
Business Risk
We define business risk as the risk to the firm of being unable
to cover its operating costs. In general, the greater the firm’s operating leverage—
the use of fixed operating costs—the higher its business risk. Although operating
leverage is an important factor affecting business risk, two other factors—
revenue stability and cost stability—also affect it. Revenue stability reflects the
relative variability of the firm’s sales revenues. Firms with stable levels of demand
and product prices tend to have stable revenues. The result is low levels of busi-
ness risk. Firms with highly volatile product demand and prices have unstable
revenues that result in high levels of business risk. Cost stability reflects the rela-
tive predictability of input prices such as those for labor and materials. The more
predictable and stable these input prices are, the lower the business risk; the less
predictable and stable they are, the higher the business risk.
Business risk varies among firms, regardless of their lines of business, and is
not affected by capital structure decisions. The level of business risk must be
taken as a “given.” The higher a firm’s business risk, the more cautious the firm
must be in establishing its capital structure. Firms with high business risk there-
fore tend toward less highly leveraged capital structures, and firms with low busi-
ness risk tend toward more highly leveraged capital structures. We will hold
business risk constant throughout the discussions that follow.
Cooke Company, a soft drink manufacturer, is preparing to make a capital struc-
ture decision. It has obtained estimates of sales and the associated levels of earn-
ings before interest and taxes (EBIT) from its forecasting group: There is a 25%
chance that sales will total $400,000, a 50% chance that sales will total
$600,000, and a 25% chance that sales will total $800,000. Fixed operating

costs total $200,000, and variable operating costs equal 50% of sales. These data
are summarized, and the resulting EBIT calculated, in Table 13.9.
The table shows that there is a 25% chance that the EBIT will be $0, a 50%
chance that it will be $100,000, and a 25% chance that it will be $200,000.
When developing the firm’s capital structure, the financial manager must accept
as given these levels of EBIT and their associated probabilities. These EBIT data
effectively reflect a certain level of business risk that captures the firm’s operating
leverage, sales revenue variability, and cost predictability.
Financial Risk
The firm’s capital structure directly affects its financial risk,
which is the risk to the firm of being unable to cover required financial obliga-
tions. The penalty for not meeting financial obligations is bankruptcy. The more
fixed-cost financing—debt (including financial leases) and preferred stock—a
firm has in its capital structure, the greater its financial leverage and risk.
Financial risk depends on the capital structure decision made by the manage-
ment, and that decision is affected by the business risk the firm faces.
Total Risk
The total risk of a firm—business and financial risk combined—
determines its probability of bankruptcy. Financial risk, its relationship to busi-
ness risk, and their combined impact can be demonstrated by continuing the
Cooke Company example.
Cooke Company’s current capital structure is as follows:

Let us assume that the firm is considering seven alternative capital structures. If
we measure these structures using the debt ratio, they are associated with ratios
of 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, and 60%. Assuming that (1) the firm has
no current liabilities, (2) its capital structure currently contains all equity as
shown, and (3) the total amount of capital remains constant14 at $500,000, the
14. This assumption is needed so that we can assess alternative capital structures without having to consider the
returns associated with the investment of additional funds raised. Attention here is given only to the mix of capital,
not to its investment.

mix of debt and equity associated with the seven debt ratios would be as shown
in Table 13.10. Also shown in the table is the number of shares of common stock
outstanding under each alternative.
Associated with each of the debt levels in column 3 of Table 13.10 would be
an interest rate that would be expected to increase with increases in financial
leverage. The level of debt, the associated interest rate (assumed to apply to all
debt), and the dollar amount of annual interest associated with each of the alter-
native capital structures are summarized in Table 13.11. Because both the level of
debt and the interest rate increase with increasing financial leverage (debt ratios),
the annual interest increases as well.
Table 13.12 on page 530 uses the levels of EBIT and associated probabilities
developed in Table 13.9, the number of shares of common stock found in column 5
of Table 13.10, and the annual interest values calculated in column 3 of Table 13.11
to calculate the earnings per share (EPS) for debt ratios of 0%, 30%, and 60%.

A 40% tax rate is assumed. Also shown are the resulting expected EPS, the
standard deviation of EPS, and the coefficient of variation of EPS associated
with each debt ratio.15
15. For explanatory convenience, the coefficient of variation of EPS, which measures total (nondiversifiable and diver-
sifiable) risk, is used throughout this chapter as a proxy for beta, which measures the relevant nondiversifiable risk.

Table 13.13 summarizes the pertinent data for the seven alternative capital
structures. The values shown for 0%, 30%, and 60% debt ratios were developed
in Table 13.12, whereas calculations of similar values for the other debt ratios
(10%, 20%, 40%, and 50%) are not shown. Because the coefficient of variation
measures the risk relative to the expected EPS, it is the preferred risk measure for
use in comparing capital structures. As the firm’s financial leverage increases, so
does its coefficient of variation of EPS. As expected, an increasing level of risk is
associated with increased levels of financial leverage.
The relative risks of the two extremes of the capital structures evaluated in
Table 13.12 (debt ratios
0% and 60%) can be illustrated by showing the prob-
ability distribution of EPS associated with each of them. Figure 13.3 shows these

two distributions. The expected level of EPS increases with increasing financial
leverage, and so does risk as reflected by the difference in dispersion between the
distributions. Clearly, the uncertainty of the expected EPS, as well as the chance
of experiencing negative EPS, is greater when higher degrees of financial leverage
are employed.
Further, the nature of the risk–return trade-off associated with the seven capital
structures under consideration can be clearly observed by plotting the expected EPS
and coefficient of variation relative to the debt ratio. Plotting the data from
Table 13.13 results in Figure 13.4. The figure shows that as debt is substituted for
equity (as the debt ratio increases), the level of EPS rises and then begins to fall
(graph a). The graph demonstrates that the peak of earnings per share occurs at a
debt ratio of 50%. The decline in earnings per share beyond that ratio results from
the fact that the significant increases in interest are not fully offset by the reduction
in the number of shares of common stock outstanding.
If we look at the risk behavior as measured by the coefficient of variation
(graph b), we can see that risk increases with increasing leverage. A portion of the
risk can be attributed to business risk, but the portion that changes in response to
increasing financial leverage would be attributed to financial risk.
Clearly, a risk–return trade-off exists relative to the use of financial leverage.
Later in the chapter, we will address how to combine these risk–return factors
into a valuation framework. The key point to recognize here is that as a firm
introduces more leverage into its capital structure, it will typically experience
increases in both the expected level of return and the associated risk.
Agency Costs Imposed by Lenders
As noted in Chapter 1, the managers of firms typically act as agents of the owners
(stockholders). The owners give the managers the authority to manage the firm
for the owners’ benefit. The agency problem created by this relationship extends
not only to the relationship between owners and managers but also to the rela-
tionship between owners and lenders.

When a lender provides funds to a firm, the interest rate charged is based on
the lender’s assessment of the firm’s risk. The lender–borrower relationship,
therefore, depends on the lender’s expectations for the firm’s subsequent
behavior. The borrowing rates are, in effect, locked in when the loans are negoti-
ated. After obtaining a loan at a certain rate, the firm could increase its risk by
investing in risky projects or by incurring additional debt. Such action could
weaken the lender’s position in terms of its claim on the cash flow of the firm.
From another point of view, if these risky investment strategies paid off, the
stockholders would benefit. Because payment obligations to the lender remain
unchanged, the excess cash flows generated by a positive outcome from the
riskier action would enhance the value of the firm to its owners. In other words,
if the risky investments pay off, the owners receive all the benefits; if the risky
investments do not pay off, the lenders share in the costs.
Clearly, an incentive exists for the managers acting on behalf of the stock-
holders to “take advantage” of lenders. To avoid this situation, lenders impose
certain monitoring techniques on borrowers, who as a result incur agency costs.
The most obvious strategy is to deny subsequent loan requests or to increase the
cost of future loans to the firm. But this strategy is an after-the-fact approach.
Therefore, lenders typically protect themselves by including in the loan agreement
provisions that limit the firm’s ability to alter its business and financial risk.
These loan provisions tend to center on issues such as the minimum level of liq-
uidity, asset acquisitions, executive salaries, and dividend payments.
By including appropriate provisions in the loan agreement, the lender can con-
trol the firm’s risk and thus protect itself against the adverse consequences of this
agency problem. Of course, in exchange for incurring agency costs by agreeing to
the operating and financial constraints placed on it by the loan provisions, the
firm should benefit by obtaining funds at a lower cost.
Asymmetric Information
The Pecking Order Theory
When two parties in an economic transaction
have different information, we say that there is asymmetric information. In the
context of capital structure decisions, asymmetric information simply means that
managers of the firm have more information about the firm’s operations and
future prospects than investors have. To understand how asymmetric information
between managers and investors could have implications for a firm’s capital
structure, consider the following situation.
Suppose that managers of a firm have a highly profitable investment oppor-
tunity that requires financing. Managers would like to tell investors about this
great investment opportunity, but investors are skeptical. After all, managers
always have incentives to claim that their investment decisions will lead to fabu-
lous profits, but investors have no way to verify these claims. If managers try to
sell stock to finance the investments, investors are only willing to pay a price that
reflects the verifiable information that they have, which means that managers
have to sell stock at a discount (relative to the price that they could get if there
were no asymmetric information). This makes raising new equity very costly, and
sometimes managers may decide to pass up positive NPV investments to avoid
having to sell equity to investors at a discount.
One solution to this problem is for managers to maintain financial slack, cash
reserves from retained earnings that they can use to finance new investments.
CHAPTER 13
Leverage and Capital Structure
533
asymmetric information
The situation in which
managers of a firm have more
information about operations
and future prospects than do
investors.

When firms do not have enough financial slack to finance their profitable invest-
ment opportunities, managers will prefer to raise external financing by issuing
debt rather than equity. Providers of debt financing receive a fixed return, so
when the new investment begins to generate high returns for the firm, those cash
flows will largely go to the firm’s existing stockholders.
All of this suggests that there is a financial pecking order, meaning a hier-
archy of financing that begins with retained earnings, followed by debt, and
finally new stock issues. When managers want to finance a new project, they will
first do so using retained earnings. If internally generated cash is insufficient to
fund new investments, then managers will raise external financing through the
debt markets. Issuing new equity is their last resort.
This pecking order theory is consistent with several facts about firms’ financing
decisions. First, the vast majority of new investments are funded through retained
earnings—firms raise external financing infrequently. Second, firms do raise debt
with greater frequency than equity as the pecking order theory predicts. Third, as
we have already noted, there is a general tendency for profitable companies (who
have plenty of financial slack) to borrow less than unprofitable firms.
Signaling
There is an old saying that goes, “put your money where your
mouth is.” The idea is that anyone can brag, but only those who are willing to
put real dollars at stake behind their claims ought to be believed. How does this
aphorism relate to capital structure decisions? Suppose, for example, that man-
agement has information that the prospects for the firm’s future are very good.
Managers could issue a press release trying to convince investors that the firm’s
future is bright, but investors will want tangible evidence for the claims.
Furthermore, providing that evidence has to be costly to the firm; otherwise,
other firms with less rosy prospects will just mimic the actions of the firm with
truly excellent prospects. One thing that managers might do is to borrow a lot of
money by issuing debt. In so doing, they are demonstrating to the market that
they have faith that the firm will generate sufficient cash flows in the future to
retire the outstanding debt. Firms whose prospects are not as good will hesitate to
issue a lot of debt because they may have difficulty repaying the debt and may
even go bankrupt. In other words, issuing debt is a credible signal that managers
believe the firm’s performance will be very good in the future. Debt financing is a
positive signal suggesting that management believes that the stock is “under-
valued” and therefore a bargain.
By the same token, when firms decide to issue stock, investors worry that this
could be a negative signal, indicating that managers believe the firm’s future prof-
itability may be rather poor and that the stock price is currently overvalued.
Therefore, investors often interpret the announcement of a stock issue as bad
news, and the stock price declines.
Most research casts doubt on the importance of signaling as a primary determi-
nant of firms’ capital structure choices. For instance, we have already seen that the
most profitable firms tend to borrow less, whereas the signaling theory says that
profitable firms should borrow more as a way to convince investors of just how high
the firm’s future profits will be. Furthermore, in surveys that ask managers to
describe how they choose between debt and equity financing, they rarely say that
they choose debt as a way to convey information to investors. Still, the signaling
theory predicts that a firm’s stock price should rise when it issues debt and fall when
it issues equity, and that is exactly what happens in the real world much of the time.

OPTIMAL CAPITAL STRUCTURE
What, then, is the optimal capital structure, even if it exists (so far) only in
theory? To provide some insight into an answer, we will examine some basic
financial relationships. Because the value of a firm equals the present value of its
future cash flows, it follows that the value of the firm is maximized when the cost
of capital is minimized. In other words, the present value of future cash flows is
at its highest when the discount rate (the cost of capital) is at its lowest. By using
a modification of the simple zero-growth valuation model (see Equation 7.2 in
Chapter 7), we can define the value of the firm, V, by Equation 13.11:
(13.11)
where
net operating profits after taxes, which is the after-tax 
operating earnings available to the debt and equity 
holders, 
Clearly, if we assume that NOPAT (and therefore EBIT) is constant, the value of
the firm, V, is maximized by minimizing the weighted average cost of capital, ra.
Cost Functions
Figure 13.5(a) plots three cost functions—the cost of debt, the cost of equity, and
the weighted average cost of capital (WACC)—as a function of financial leverage
measured by the debt ratio (debt to total assets). The cost of debt, ri, remains low
because of the tax shield, but it slowly increases as leverage increases, to compen-
sate lenders for increasing risk. The cost of equity, rs, is above the cost of debt. It
increases as financial leverage increases, but it generally increases more rapidly
than the cost of debt. The cost of equity rises because the stockholders require a
higher return as leverage increases, to compensate for the higher degree of finan-
cial risk.
The weighted average cost of capital, ra, results from a weighted average of the
firm’s debt and equity capital costs. At a debt ratio of zero, the firm is 100 percent
equity financed. As debt is substituted for equity and as the debt ratio increases, the
WACC declines because the after-tax debt cost is less than the equity cost (ri
rs).
In this range, the tax benefits of additional debt outweigh the costs of borrowing
more. However, as the debt ratio continues to increase, the increased debt and equity
costs eventually cause the WACC to rise (after point M in Figure 13.5(a)). In other
words, the bankruptcy costs, agency costs, and other costs associated with higher
debt levels eventually outweigh the additional tax benefits that the firm could
generate by borrowing even more. This behavior results in a U-shaped, or saucer-
shaped, weighted average cost-of-capital function, ra.
Graphical View of Optimal Structure
Because the maximization of value, V, is achieved when the overall cost of cap-
ital, ra, is at a minimum (see Equation 13.11), the optimal capital structure is that

at which the weighted average cost of capital, ra, is minimized. In Figure 13.5(a),
point M represents the minimum weighted average cost of capital—the point of
optimal financial leverage and hence of optimal capital structure for the firm.
Figure 13.5(b) plots the value of the firm that results from substitution of ra in
Figure 13.5(a) for various levels of financial leverage into the zero-growth valua-
tion model in Equation 13.11. As shown in Figure 13.5(b), at the optimal capital
structure, point M, the value of the firm is maximized at V*.
Simply stated, minimizing the weighted average cost of capital allows man-
agement to undertake a larger number of profitable projects, thereby further
increasing the value of the firm. However, as a practical matter, there is no way to
calculate the optimal capital structure implied by Figure 13.5. Because it is
impossible either to know or to remain at the precise optimal capital structure,
firms generally try to operate in a range that places them near what they believe
to be the optimal capital structure. In other words, firms usually manage toward
a target capital structure.

13.3 EBIT–EPS Approach to Capital Structure
It should be clear from earlier chapters that the goal of the financial manager is to
maximize owner wealth—that is, the firm’s stock price. One of the widely fol-
lowed variables affecting the firm’s stock price is its earnings, which represents
the returns earned on behalf of owners. In spite of the fact that focusing on earn-
ings ignores risk (the other key variable affecting the firm’s stock price), earnings
per share (EPS) can be conveniently used to analyze alternative capital structures.
The EBIT–EPS approach to capital structure involves selecting the capital struc-
ture that maximizes EPS over the expected range of earnings before interest and
taxes (EBIT).
PRESENTING A FINANCING PLAN GRAPHICALLY
To analyze the effects of a firm’s capital structure on the owners’ returns, we con-
sider the relationship between earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and earn-
ings per share (EPS). In other words, we want to see how changes in EBIT lead to
changes in EPS under different capital structures. In all of our examples we will
assume that business risk remains constant. That is, the firm’s basic operational
risks remain constant, and only financial risk varies as capital structures change.
EPS is used to measure the owners’ returns, which are expected to be closely
related to share price.16
Data Required
To draw a graph illustrating how changes in EBIT lead to changes in EPS, we
simply need to find two coordinates and plot a straight line between them. On
our graph, we will plot EBIT on the horizontal axis and EPS on the vertical axis.
The following example illustrates the approach for constructing the graph.
LG 5

capital structure that

(EPS) over the expected range

16. The relationship that is expected to exist between EPS and owner wealth is not one of cause and effect. As indi-
cated in Chapter 1, the maximization of profits does not necessarily ensure that owners’ wealth is also maximized.
Nevertheless, it is expected that the movement of earnings per share will have some effect on owners’ wealth,
because EPS data constitute one of the few pieces of information investors receive, and they often bid the firm’s share
price up or down in response to the level of these earnings.

We can plot coordinates on the EBIT–EPS graph by assuming specific EBIT
values and calculating the EPS associated with them.17 Such calculations for three
capital structures—debt ratios of 0%, 30%, and 60%—for Cooke Company
were presented in Table 13.12. For EBIT values of $100,000 and $200,000, the
associated EPS values calculated there are summarized in the table below the
graph in Figure 13.6.
Plotting the Data
The Cooke Company data can be plotted on a set of EBIT–EPS axes, as shown in
Figure 13.6. The figure shows the level of EPS expected for each level of EBIT.
For levels of EBIT below the x-axis intercept, a loss (negative EPS) results. Each
Example 13.19 3

17. A convenient method for finding one EBIT—EPS coordinate is to calculate the financial breakeven point, the
level of EBIT for which the firm’s EPS just equals $0. It is the level of EBIT needed just to cover all fixed financial
costs—annual interest (I) and preferred stock dividends (PD). The equation for the financial breakeven point is
where T is the tax rate. It can be seen that when 
, the financial breakeven point is equal to I, the annual
interest payment.

to just cover all fixed financial costs (EPS

COMPARING ALTERNATIVE CAPITAL STRUCTURES
We can compare alternative capital structures by graphing financing plans as
shown in Figure 13.6.
Cooke Company’s capital structure alternatives were plotted on the EBIT–EPS
axes in Figure 13.6. This figure shows that each capital structure is superior to
the others in terms of maximizing EPS over certain ranges of EBIT. Having no
debt at all (debt ratio
0%) is best for levels of EBIT between $0 and $50,000.
That makes sense because when business conditions are relatively weak, Cooke
would have difficulty meeting its financial obligations if it had any debt. Between
$50,000 and $95,500 of EBIT, the capital structure associated with a debt ratio
of 30% produces higher EPS than either of the other two capital structures. And
when EBIT exceeds $95,500, the 60% debt ratio capital structure provides the
highest earnings per share.18 Again, the intuition behind this result is fairly
straightforward. When business is booming, the best thing for shareholders is for
the firm to use a great deal of debt. The firm pays lenders a relatively low rate of
return, and the shareholders keep the rest.
CONSIDERING RISK IN EBIT–EPS ANALYSIS
When interpreting EBIT–EPS analysis, it is important to consider the risk of each
capital structure alternative. Graphically, the risk of each capital structure can be
viewed in light of two measures: (1) the financial breakeven point (EBIT-axis
intercept) and (2) the degree of financial leverage reflected in the slope of the cap-
ital structure line: The higher the financial breakeven point and the steeper the
slope of the capital structure line, the greater the financial risk.19

18. An algebraic technique can be used to find the indifference points between the capital structure alternatives. This
technique involves expressing each capital structure as an equation stated in terms of earnings per share, setting the
equations for two capital structures equal to each other, and solving for the level of EBIT that causes the equations
to be equal. When we use the notation from footnote 17 and let n equal the number of shares of common stock
outstanding, the general equation for the earnings per share from a financing plan is
Comparing Cooke Company’s 0% and 30% capital structures, we get
The calculated value of the indifference point between the 0% and 30% capital structures is therefore $50,000, as
can be seen in Figure 13.6.
19. The degree of financial leverage (DFL) is reflected in the slope of the EBIT–EPS function. The steeper the slope,
the greater the degree of financial leverage, because the change in EPS (y axis) that results from a given change in
EBIT (x axis) increases with increasing slope and decreases with decreasing slope.
EBIT = $50

n

Further assessment of risk can be performed by using ratios. As financial
leverage (measured by the debt ratio) increases, we expect a corresponding
decline in the firm’s ability to make scheduled interest payments (measured by the
times interest earned ratio).
Reviewing the three capital structures plotted for Cooke Company in Figure 13.6, we
can see that as the debt ratio increases, so does the financial risk of each alternative.
Both the financial breakeven point and the slope of the capital structure lines increase
with increasing debt ratios. If we use the $100,000 EBIT value, for example, the
times interest earned ratio (EBIT
interest) for the zero-leverage capital structure is
infinity ($100,000
$0); for the 30% debt case, it is 6.67 ($100,000
$15,000);
and for the 60% debt case, it is 2.02 ($100,000
$49,500). Because lower times
interest earned ratios reflect higher risk, these ratios support the conclusion that the
risk of the capital structures increases with increasing financial leverage. The capital
structure for a debt ratio of 60% is riskier than that for a debt ratio of 30%, which in
turn is riskier than the capital structure for a debt ratio of 0%.
BASIC SHORTCOMING OF EBIT–EPS ANALYSIS
The most important point to recognize when using EBIT–EPS analysis is that this
technique tends to concentrate on maximizing earnings rather than maximizing
owner wealth as reflected in the firm’s stock price. The use of an EPS-maximizing
approach generally ignores risk. If investors did not require risk premiums (addi-
tional returns) as the firm increased the proportion of debt in its capital structure, a
strategy involving maximizing EPS would also maximize stock price. But because
risk premiums increase with increases in financial leverage, the maximization of EPS
does not ensure owner wealth maximization. To select the best capital structure,
firms must integrate both return (EPS) and risk (via the required return, rs) into a
valuation framework consistent with the capital structure theory presented earlier.

13.4 Choosing the Optimal Capital Structure
A wealth maximization framework for use in making capital structure decisions
should include the two key factors of return and risk. This section describes the
procedures for linking to market value the return and risk associated with alter-
native capital structures.
LINKAGE
To determine the firm’s value under alternative capital structures, the firm must
find the level of return that it must earn to compensate owners for the risk being
incurred. This approach is consistent with the overall valuation framework
developed in Chapters 6 and 7 and applied to capital budgeting decisions in
Chapters 10 through 12.
LG 6

The required return associated with a given level of financial risk can be esti-
mated in a number of ways. Theoretically, the preferred approach would be first
to estimate the beta associated with each alternative capital structure and then to
use the CAPM framework presented in Equation 8.8 to calculate the required
return, rs. A more operational approach involves linking the financial risk associ-
ated with each capital structure alternative directly to the required return. Such an
approach is similar to the CAPM-type approach demonstrated in Chapter 12 for
linking project risk and required return (RADR). Here it involves estimating the
required return associated with each level of financial risk, as measured by a sta-
tistic such as the coefficient of variation of EPS. Regardless of the approach used,
one would expect the required return to increase as the financial risk increases.
Cooke Company, using as risk measures the coefficients of variation of EPS asso-
ciated with each of the seven alternative capital structures, estimated the associ-
ated required returns. These are shown in Table 13.14. As expected, the estimated
required return of owners, rs, increases with increasing risk, as measured by the
coefficient of variation of EPS.
ESTIMATING VALUE
The value of the firm associated with alternative capital structures can be esti-
mated by using one of the standard valuation models. If, for simplicity, we
assume that all earnings are paid out as dividends, we can use a zero-growth val-
uation model such as that developed in Chapter 7. The model, originally stated in
Equation 7.2, is restated here with EPS substituted for dividends (because in each
year the dividends would equal EPS):
(13.12)
By substituting the expected level of EPS and the associated required return, rs,
into Equation 13.12, we can estimate the per-share value of the firm, P0.
P0 = EPS

13.12 for each of the capital structures, we obtain the share values given in column 3

as shown in Figure 13.7, clearly illustrates that the maximum share value occurs at
the capital structure associated with a debt ratio of 30%.

MAXIMIZING VALUE VERSUS MAXIMIZING EPS
Throughout this text, we have specified the goal of the financial manager as max-
imizing owner wealth, not profit. Although some relationship exists between
expected profit and value, there is no reason to believe that profit-maximizing
strategies necessarily result in wealth maximization. It is therefore the wealth of
the owners as reflected in the estimated share value that should serve as the crite-
rion for selecting the best capital structure. A final look at Cooke Company will
highlight this point.
Further analysis of Figure 13.7 clearly shows that although the firm’s profits
(EPS) are maximized at a debt ratio of 50%, share value is maximized at a 30%
debt ratio. Therefore, the preferred capital structure would be the 30% debt
ratio. The two approaches provide different conclusions because EPS maximiza-
tion does not consider risk.
SOME OTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS
Because there is really no practical way to calculate the optimal capital structure,
any quantitative analysis of capital structure must be tempered with other important
considerations. Table 13.16 summarizes some of the more important additional
factors involved in capital structure decisions.

Important Factors to Consider in Making Capital Structure Decisions
Concern

Description
Business risk
Revenue stability
Firms that have stable and predictable revenues can more safely
undertake highly leveraged capital structures than can firms with
volatile patterns of sales revenue. Firms with growing sales tend to
benefit from added debt; they can reap the positive benefits of
financial leverage, which magnifies the effect of these increases.
Cash flow
When considering a new capital structure, the firm must focus on
its ability to generate the cash flows necessary to meet obligations.
Cash forecasts reflecting an ability to service debts (and preferred
stock) must support any shift in capital structure.
Agency costs
Contractual obligations
A firm may be contractually constrained with respect to the type of
funds that it can raise. For example, a firm might be prohibited
from selling additional debt except when the claims of holders of
such debt are made subordinate to the existing debt. Contractual
constraints on the sale of additional stock, as well as on the ability
to distribute dividends on stock, might also exist.
Management preferences
Occasionally, a firm will impose an internal constraint on the use
of debt to limit its risk exposure to a level deemed acceptable to
management. In other words, because of risk aversion, the firm’s
management constrains the firm’s capital structure at a level that
may or may not be the true optimum.

PART 6
Long-Term Financial Decisions
Important Factors to Consider in Making Capital Structure Decisions (continued)
Concern
Factor
Description
Control
A management group concerned about control may prefer to issue
debt rather than (voting) common stock. Under favorable market
conditions, a firm that wanted to sell equity could make a
preemptive offering or issue nonvoting shares, allowing each
shareholder to maintain proportionate ownership. Generally, only
in closely held firms or firms threatened by takeover does control
become a major concern in the capital structure decision.
Asymmetric information
External risk assessment
The firm’s ability to raise funds quickly and at favorable rates
depends on the external risk assessments of lenders and bond
raters. The firm must consider the impact of capital structure
decisions both on share value and on published financial
statements from which lenders and raters assess the firm’s risk.
Timing
At times when interest rates are low, debt financing might be more
attractive; when interest rates are high, the sale of stock may be
more appealing. Sometimes both debt and equity capital become
unavailable at reasonable terms. General economic conditions—
especially those of the capital market—can thus significantly affect
capital structure decisions.
TABLE 13.16
Summary
FOCUS ON VALUE
The amount of leverage (fixed-cost assets or funds) employed by a firm directly
affects its risk, return, and share value. Generally, higher leverage raises risk and
return, and lower leverage reduces risk and return. Operating leverage concerns
the level of fixed operating costs; financial leverage focuses on fixed financial
costs, particularly interest on debt and any preferred stock dividends. The firm’s
capital structure determines its financial leverage. Because of its fixed interest
payments, the more debt a firm employs relative to its equity, the greater its
financial leverage.
The value of the firm is clearly affected by its degree of operating leverage
and by the composition of its capital structure. The financial manager must
therefore carefully consider the types of operating and financial costs the firm
will incur, recognizing that higher risk comes with greater fixed costs. Major
decisions with regard to both operating cost structure and capital structure must
therefore focus on their impact on the firm’s value. The firm should implement
only those leverage and capital structure decisions that are consistent with its
goal of maximizing its stock price.

REVIEW OF LEARNING GOALS
Discuss leverage, capital structure, breakeven analysis, the operating
breakeven point, and the effect of changing costs on it. Leverage results from the
use of fixed costs to magnify returns to a firm’s owners. Capital structure, the
firm’s mix of long-term debt and equity, affects leverage and therefore the firm’s
value. Breakeven analysis measures the level of sales necessary to cover total
operating costs. The operating breakeven point may be calculated algebraically,
by dividing fixed operating costs by the difference between the sale price per
unit and variable operating cost per unit, or it may be determined graphically.
The operating breakeven point increases with increased fixed and variable oper-
ating costs and decreases with an increase in sale price, and vice versa.
Understand operating, financial, and total leverage and the relationships
among them. Operating leverage is the use of fixed operating costs by the firm
to magnify the effects of changes in sales on EBIT. The higher the fixed oper-
ating costs, the greater the operating leverage. Financial leverage is the use of
fixed financial costs by the firm to magnify the effects of changes in EBIT on
EPS. The higher the fixed financial costs, the greater the financial leverage. 
The total leverage of the firm is the use of fixed costs—both operating and
financial—to magnify the effects of changes in sales on EPS.
Describe the types of capital, external assessment of capital structure, the
capital structure of non–U.S. firms, and capital structure theory. Debt capital
and equity capital make up a firm’s capital structure. Capital structure can be
externally assessed by using financial ratios—debt ratio, times interest earned
ratio, and fixed-payment coverage ratio. Non–U.S. companies tend to have
much higher degrees of indebtedness than do their U.S. counterparts, primarily
because U.S. capital markets are more developed.
Research suggests that there is an optimal capital structure that balances the
firm’s benefits and costs of debt financing. The major benefit of debt financing is
the tax shield. The costs of debt financing include the probability of bankruptcy,
agency costs imposed by lenders, and asymmetric information, which typically
causes firms to raise funds in a pecking order so as to send positive signals to the
market and thereby enhance shareholder wealth.
Explain the optimal capital structure using a graphical view of the firm’s
cost-of-capital functions and a zero-growth valuation model. The zero-growth
valuation model defines the firm’s value as its net operating profits after taxes
(NOPAT), or after-tax EBIT, divided by its weighted average cost of capital.
Assuming that NOPAT is constant, the value of the firm is maximized by mini-
mizing its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The optimal capital struc-
ture minimizes the WACC. Graphically, the firm’s WACC exhibits a U-shape,
whose minimum value defines the optimal capital structure that maximizes
owner wealth.
Discuss the EBIT–EPS approach to capital structure. The EBIT–EPS
approach evaluates capital structures in light of the returns they provide the
firm’s owners and their degree of financial risk. Under the EBIT–EPS approach,
the preferred capital structure is the one that is expected to provide maximum
EPS over the firm’s expected range of EBIT. Graphically, this approach reflects

CHAPTER 13

risk in terms of the financial breakeven point and the slope of the capital struc-
ture line. The major shortcoming of EBIT–EPS analysis is that it concentrates on
maximizing earnings (returns) rather than owners’ wealth, which considers risk
as well as return.
Review the return and risk of alternative capital structures, their linkage
to market value, and other important considerations related to capital structure.
The best capital structure can be selected by using a valuation model to link return
and risk factors. The preferred capital structure is the one that results in the
highest estimated share value, not the highest EPS. Other important nonquantita-
tive factors must also be considered when making capital structure decisions.

Molly Jasper and her sister, Caitlin Peters, got into the novelties
business almost by accident. Molly, a talented sculptor, often made little figurines as
gifts for friends. Occasionally, she and Caitlin would set up a booth at a crafts fair
and sell a few of the figurines along with jewelry that Caitlin made. Little by little,
demand for the figurines, now called Mollycaits, grew, and the sisters began to
reproduce some of the favorites in resin, using molds of the originals. The day came
when a buyer for a major department store offered them a contract to produce
1,500 figurines of various designs for $10,000. Molly and Caitlin realized that it
was time to get down to business. To make bookkeeping simpler, Molly had priced
all of the figurines at $8.00. Variable operating costs amounted to an average of
$6.00 per unit. To produce the order, Molly and Caitlin would have to rent indus-
trial facilities for a month, which would cost them $4,000.

Spreadsheet Exercise
Starstruck Company would like to determine its optimal capital structure. Several of
its managers believe that the best method is to rely on the estimated earnings per
share (EPS) of the firm because they feel that profits and stock price are closely
related. The financial managers have suggested another method that uses estimated
required returns to estimate the share value of the firm. The following financial data
are available.
TO DO
a. Based on the given financial data, create a spreadsheet to calculate the estimated
share values associated with the seven alternative capital structures. Refer to
Table 13.15.
b. Use Excel to graph the relationship between capital structure and the estimated
EPS of the firm. What is the optimal debt ratio? Refer to Figure 13.7.
c. Use Excel to graph the relationship between capital structure and the estimated
share value of the firm. What is the optimal debt ratio? Refer to Figure 13.7.
d. Do both methods lead to the same optimal capital structure? Which method do
you favor? Explain.
e. What is the major difference between the EPS and share value methods?

Why This Chapter Matters to You
In your professional life
ACCOUNTING You need to understand the types of dividends and
payment procedures for them because you will need to record and
report the declaration and payment of dividends; you also will provide
the financial data that management must have to make dividend 
decisions.
INFORMATION SYSTEMS You need to understand types of dividends,
payment procedures, and the financial data that the firm must have to
make and implement dividend decisions.
MANAGEMENT To make appropriate dividend decisions for the firm,
you need to understand types of dividends, arguments about the rele-
vance of dividends, the factors that affect dividend policy, and types of
dividend policies.
MARKETING You need to understand factors affecting dividend policy
because you may want to argue that the firm would be better off
retaining funds for use in new marketing programs or products, rather
than paying them out as dividends.
OPERATIONS You need to understand factors affecting dividend policy
because you may find that the firm’s dividend policy imposes limita-
tions on planned expansion, replacement, or renewal projects.
Many individual investors buy
common stock for the anticipated
cash dividends. From a personal finance perspective, you should
understand why and how firms pay dividends and the informational
and financial implications of receiving them. Such understanding will
help you select common stocks that have dividend-paying patterns con-
sistent with your long-term financial goals.

Payback Time
T
he electronics retailer Best Buy is one of the most
remarkable growth stories of the last two decades.
After listing its shares on the New York Stock Exchange
in 1987, the company saw revenues grow from $239
million to $49.7 billion by 2010, an annual rate of
increase exceeding 26 percent. Throughout most of this
growth period, Best Buy plowed its earnings back into
the business to finance new investment. It wasn’t until
2003 that the firm began paying dividends regularly.
While many companies cut their dividends during the economic crisis of 2008–2009,
Best Buy maintained its quarterly dividend at $0.14 per share. After holding the dividend steady
for two years, Best Buy’s board of directors announced on June 24, 2010, that it would
increase the dividend by 7 percent to $0.15 per share. With more than 420 million common
shares outstanding, a $0.15 dividend meant that Best Buy would distribute $63 million to share-
holders every quarter, or more than $250 million per year.
Even with the dividend increase, Best Buy was in no immediate danger of running out of
cash, having finished its 2010 fiscal year with a cash balance of $1.8 billion, equivalent to
more than seven quarters in dividend payments. Along with its announcement of the increased
dividend, Best Buy said it had resumed a share repurchase program that had been suspended
during the economic crisis. Under the plan, Best Buy management was authorized to repurchase
up to $2.5 billion worth of its outstanding common stock over several years. In fact, in the three
months ending on May 29, 2010, Best Buy repurchased $111 million worth of common
shares. To put that figure into perspective, over the same three months Best Buy’s cash flow from
operations totaled $169 million. In other words, during that quarter Best Buy distributed more
cash flow to its shareholders (combining repurchases and dividends) than it generated by oper-
ating its stores.

CHAPTER 14
Payout Policy
561
14.1 The Basics of Payout Policy
ELEMENTS OF PAYOUT POLICY
The term payout policy refers to the decisions that firms make about whether to
distribute cash to shareholders, how much cash to distribute, and by what
means the cash should be distributed. While these decisions are probably less
important than the investment decisions covered in Chapters 10 through 12 and
the financing choices discussed in Chapter 13, they are nonetheless decisions
that managers and boards of directors face routinely. Investors monitor firms’
payout policies carefully, and unexpected changes in those policies can have sig-
nificant effects on firms’ stock prices. The recent history of Best Buy, briefly out-
lined in the chapter opener, demonstrates many of the important dimensions of
payout policy.
Like most rapidly growing firms, Best Buy decided not to pay any cash to
shareholders for many years, preferring instead to reinvest the cash that the busi-
ness generated to build and operate new stores. As the firm matured, managers
decided that cash flow from operations was sufficient to continue to reinvest in
growth and return some cash to shareholders. However, in Best Buy’s case, the
decision to begin distributing cash to shareholders in 2003 was not driven
entirely by the slowdown in the company’s growth rate. In addition, a significant
change to the tax code that year made dividends much more attractive to
investors on an after-tax basis. Best Buy’s largest shareholder at the time was its
founder, Richard Schulze, who stood to receive about $20 million in dividends
annually. Mr. Schulze would pay much less tax on these dividends after the 2003
tax law changes.
But dividends are not the only means by which firms can distribute cash to
shareholders. Firms can also conduct share repurchases, in which they typically
buy back some of their outstanding common stock through purchases in the open
market. Best Buy, like many other companies, uses both methods to put cash in
the hands of their stockholders. In its first year of paying out cash to share-
holders, Best Buy paid $130 million in dividends and bought back $100 million
worth of common stock. From 2005 through 2008, Best Buy actually distributed
more cash via share repurchases than through dividends, but, when the financial
crisis hit, the company temporarily eliminated all share repurchases while main-
taining its quarterly dividend payments.
If we generalize the lessons about payout policy from Best Buy’s recent finan-
cial history, we may expect that:
1. Rapidly growing firms generally do not pay out cash to shareholders.
2. Slowing growth, positive cash flow generation, and favorable tax conditions
can prompt firms to initiate cash payouts to investors. The ownership base of
the company can also be an important factor in the decision to distribute cash.
3. Cash payouts can be made through dividends or share repurchases. Many
companies use both methods. In some years, more cash is paid out via divi-
dends, but sometimes share repurchases are larger than dividend payments.
4. When business conditions are weak, firms are more willing to reduce share
buybacks than to cut dividends.

TRENDS IN EARNINGS AND DIVIDENDS
Figure 14.1 illustrates both long-term trends and cyclical movements in earnings and
dividends paid by large U.S. firms that are part of the S&P 500 stock index. The
figure plots monthly earnings and dividend payments from 1950 through the first
quarter of 2010. The top line represents the earnings per share of the S&P500 index,
and the lower line represents dividends per share. The vertical bars highlight 10
periods during which the U.S. economy was in recession. Several important lessons
can be gleaned from the figure. First, observe that over the long term the earnings
and dividends lines tend to move together. Figure 14.1 uses a logarithmic scale, so
that the slope of each line represents the growth rate of earnings or dividends. Over
the 60 years shown in the figure, the two lines tend to have about the same slope,
meaning that earnings and dividends grow at about the same rate when you take a
long-term perspective. This makes perfect sense—firms pay dividends out of earn-
ings, so for dividends to grow over the long-term, earnings must grow too.
Second, the earnings series is much more volatile than the dividends series.
That is, the line plotting earnings per share is quite bumpy, but the dividend line
is much smoother. This suggests that firms do not adjust their dividend payments
each time earnings move up or down. Instead, firms tend to smooth dividends,
increasing them slowly when earnings are growing rapidly and maintaining divi-
dend payments, rather than cutting them, when earnings decline.
To see this second point more clearly, look closely at the vertical bars in Figure
14.1. It is apparent that during recessions corporate earnings usually decline, but
dividends either do not decline at all or do not decline as sharply as earnings. In six
of the last ten recessions, dividends were actually higher when the recession ended
than just before it began, although the last two recessions are notable exceptions
to this pattern. Notice also that, just after the end of a recession, earnings typically
increase quite rapidly. Dividends increase, too, but not as fast.

A third lesson from Figure 14.1 is that the effect of the recent recession on
both corporate earnings and dividends was large by historical standards. An
enormous earnings decline occurred from 2007 to 2009. That forced firms to cut
dividends more drastically than they had in years, but even so the drop in divi-
dends was slight compared to the earnings decrease.
TRENDS IN DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES
When firms want to distribute cash to shareholders, they can either pay dividends
or repurchase outstanding shares. Figure 14.2 plots aggregate dividends and share
repurchases from 1971 through 2009 for all firms listed on U.S. stock exchanges
(again, the figure uses a logarithmic vertical scale). A quick glance at the figure
reveals that share repurchases played a relatively minor role in firms’ payout prac-
tices in the 1970s. In 1971, for example, aggregate dividends totaled $14.6 billion,
but share repurchases that year were just $1.3 billion. Since 1975, share repur-
chases have been growing rapidly, first eclipsing total dividend payments in 2005.
That year, firms paid $522 billion in dividends, but they repurchased almost $590
billion worth of stock. Share repurchases continued to outpace dividends for the
next four years, peaking at more than $1 trillion in 2007.
Whereas total dividends rise smoothly over time, Figure 14.2 shows that
share repurchases display much more volatility. The largest drops in repurchase
activity occurred in 1974–1975, 1981, 1986, 1990–1991, 2001–2002, and
2008–2009. All of these correspond to periods when the U.S. economy was mired
in or just emerging from a recession. During most of these periods, dividends con-
tinued to grow modestly. Only during the recent, severe recession did both share
repurchases and dividends fall.

Combining the lessons from Figures 14.1 and 14.2, we can draw three broad
conclusions about firms’ payout policies. First, firms exhibit a strong desire to
maintain modest, steady growth in dividends that is roughly consistent with the
long-run growth in earnings. Second, share repurchases have accounted for a
growing fraction of total cash payouts over time. Third, when earnings fluctuate,

Are Buybacks Really a Bargain?
When CBS announced
in March 2007 that it
would buy back $1.4 billion worth of
stock, its sagging share price saw the
biggest spike since the media giant
parted ways with Viacom in 2005.
The 4.5 percent jump may have been
an omen of good fortune—at the very
least it showed how much shareholders
like buybacks.
Companies have been gobbling 
up their own shares faster than ever in
a world of inexpensive capital and
swollen balance sheets. Since 2003,
the market for buybacks has boomed,
with repurchases nearly on a par with
capital expenditures. Some, however,
have questioned the moves and motives
that lead to a big buyback.
In addition to simply returning cash
to shareholders, many companies also
repurchase stock because they believe
their stock is undervalued. Yet new
research shows that companies often
use creative financial reporting to push
earnings downward before buybacks,
making the stock seem undervalued
and causing its price to bounce higher
after the buyback. That pleases
investors who then amplify the effect by
pushing the price even higher.
“Managers who are acting oppor-
tunistically can use their reporting dis-
cretion to reduce the repurchase price
by temporarily deflating earnings,”
argue Guojin Gong, Henock Louis,
and Amy Sun at Penn State University’s
Smeal College of Business. Observing
data from 1,720 companies, the
authors say companies can easily cre-
ate an apparent slump by speeding up
or slowing down expense recognition,
changing inventory accounting, or 
revising estimates of bad debt—all 
classic methods of making the numbers
look worse without actually breaking
accounting rules.
The penalty for being caught delib-
erately managing earnings in advance
of a buyback could be severe. With
the variety of accounting scandals that
popped up regularly in the early 2000s,
executives would no doubt be wary of
deflating earnings just to get a boost
from a buyback. Still, that’s what Louis
believes some are doing. “I don’t think
what they’re doing is illegal,” he says.
“But it’s misleading their investors.”

agers would manipulate their stock’s
value prior to a buyback, or do you
believe that corporations are more
likely to initiate a buyback to
enhance shareholder value?

Matter of fact
T
he growing importance of share repurchases in corporate payout policy is not confined to the
United States. In most of the world’s largest economies, repurchases have been on the rise in
recent years, eclipsing dividend payments at least some of the time in countries as diverse as
Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, Japan, Netherlands, South Korea, and
Switzerland. A recent study of payout policy at firms from 25 different countries found that share
repurchases rose at an annual rate of 19 percent from 1999 through 2008.
Share Repurchases Gain Worldwide Popularity
firms adjust their short-term payouts primarily by adjusting share repurchases
(rather than dividends), cutting buybacks during recessions, and increasing them
rapidly during economic expansions.
6 REVIEW QUESTIONS
14–1 What are the two ways that firms can distribute cash to shareholders?
14–2 Why do rapidly growing firms generally pay no dividends?
14–3 The dividend payout ratio equals dividends paid divided by earnings.
How would you expect this ratio to behave during a recession? What
about during an economic boom?
14.2 The Mechanics of Payout Policy
CASH DIVIDEND PAYMENT PROCEDURES
At quarterly or semiannual meetings, a firm’s board of directors decides whether
and in what amount to pay cash dividends. If the firm has already established a
precedent of paying dividends, the decision facing the board is usually whether to
maintain or increase the dividend, and that decision is based primarily on the
firm’s recent performance and its ability to generate cash flow in the future.
Boards rarely cut dividends unless they believe that the firm’s ability to generate
cash is in serious jeopardy. Figure 14.3 plots the number of U.S. firms that
increased or decreased their dividend payment in each year from 1999 through
2009. Clearly, the number of firms increasing their dividends is far greater than
the number of companies cutting dividends in most years. When the economy is
strong, as it was from 2003 to 2006, the ratio of firms increasing dividends to
those cutting dividends may be 30 to 1 or higher. However, a sign of the severity
of the most recent recession was that in 2009 this ratio was just 1.5 to 1. That
year, 1,191 firms increased their dividend, while 804 firms cut dividends.
When a firm’s directors declare a dividend, they issue a statement indicating
the dividend amount and setting three important dates—the date of record, the
ex-dividend date, and the payment date. All persons whose names are recorded as
stockholders on the date of record receive the dividend. These stockholders are
often referred to as holders of record.
Because of the time needed to make bookkeeping entries when a stock is traded,
the stock begins selling ex dividend 2 business days prior to the date of record.
Purchasers of a stock selling ex dividend do not receive the current dividend. A simple

way to determine the first day on which the stock sells ex dividend is to subtract 2
business days from the date of record.
The payment date is the actual date on which the firm mails the dividend
payment to the holders of record. It is generally a few weeks after the record date.
An example will clarify the various dates and the accounting effects.
On June 24, 2010, the board of directors of Best Buy announced that the firm’s
next quarterly cash dividend would be $0.15 per share, payable on October 26,
2010 to shareholders of record on Tuesday, October 5, 2010. Best Buy shares
would begin trading ex dividend on the previous Friday, October 1. At the time
of the announcement, Best Buy had 420,061,666 shares of common stock out-
standing, so the total dividend payment would be $63,009,250. Figure 14.4
shows a time line depicting the key dates relative to the Best Buy dividend. Before
the dividend was declared, the key accounts of the firm were as follows (dollar
values quoted in thousands):1

The net effect of declaring and paying the dividend was to reduce the firm’s total
assets (and stockholders’ equity) by $63 million.
SHARE REPURCHASE PROCEDURES
The mechanics of cash dividend payments are virtually the same for every divi-
dend paid by every public company. With share repurchases, firms can use at
least two different methods to get cash into the hands of shareholders. The most
common method of executing a share repurchase program is called an open-
market share repurchase. In an open-market share repurchase, as the name sug-
gests, firms simply buy back some of their outstanding shares on the open
market. Firms have a great deal of latitude regarding when and how they execute
these open-market purchases. Some firms make purchases in fixed amounts at
regular intervals, while other firms try to behave more opportunistically, buying
back more shares when they think the share price is relatively low and fewer
shares when the price is high.
In contrast, firms sometimes repurchase shares through a self-tender offer or
simply a tender offer. In a tender offer, a firm announces the price it is willing to
pay to buy back shares and the quantity of shares it wishes to repurchase. The
tender offer price is usually set at a significant premium above the current market
price. Shareholders who want to participate let the firm know how many shares
they would like to sell back to the firm at the stated price. If shareholders do not
offer to sell back as many shares as the firm wants to repurchase, the firm may
either cancel or extend the offer. If the offer is oversubscribed, meaning that
shareholders want to sell more shares than the firms wants to repurchase, then

the firm typically repurchases shares on a pro rata basis. For example, if the firm
wants to buy back 10 million shares, but 20 million shares are tendered by
investors, then the firm would repurchase exactly half of the shares tendered by
each shareholder.
A third method of buying back shares is called a Dutch auction. In a Dutch
auction, the firm specifies a range of prices at which it is willing to repurchase
shares and the quantity of shares that it desires. Investors can tender their shares
to the firm at any price in the specified range, and this allows the firm to trace out
a demand curve for their stock. That is, the demand curve specifies how many
shares investors will sell back to the firm at each price in the offer range. This
allows the firm to determine the minimum price required to repurchase the
desired quantity of shares, and every shareholder receives that price.
In July 2010, Fidelity National Information Services announced a Dutch auction
repurchase for 86 million common shares at prices ranging from $29 to $31.50 per
share. Fidelity shareholders were instructed to contact the company to indicate
how many shares they would be willing to sell at different prices in this range.
Suppose that after accumulating this information from investors, Fidelity con-
structed the following demand schedule:

who expressed a willingness to tender their shares at a price of $31.25 or less
receives $31.25, and Fidelity repurchases all 86 million shares at a cost of roughly
$2.7 billion.
TAX TREATMENT OF DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASES
For many years, dividends and share repurchases had very different tax conse-
quences. The dividends that investors received were generally taxed at ordinary
income tax rates. Therefore, if a firm paid $10 million in dividends, that payout
would trigger significant tax liabilities for the firm’s shareholders (at least those
subject to personal income taxes). On the other hand, when firms repurchased
shares, the taxes triggered by that type of payout were generally much lower. There
were several reasons for this. Only those shareholders who sold their shares as part
of the repurchase program had any potential tax liability. Shareholders who did not
participate did not owe any taxes. Furthermore, some shareholders who did partic-
ipate in the repurchase program might not owe any taxes on the funds they

received if they were tax-exempt institutions or if they sold their shares at a loss.
Finally, even those shareholders who participated in the repurchase program and
sold their shares for a profit paid taxes only at the (usually lower) capital gains tax
rate, and even that tax only applied to the gain, not to the entire value of the shares
repurchased. Consequently, investors could generally expect to pay far less in taxes
on money that a firm distributed through a share repurchase compared to money
paid out as dividends. That differential tax treatment in part explains the growing
popularity of share repurchase programs in the 1980s and 1990s.
The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 significantly
changed the tax treatment of corporate dividends for most taxpayers. Prior to
passage of the 2003 law, dividends received by investors were taxed as ordinary
income at rates as high as 35 percent. The 2003 act reduced the tax rate on cor-
porate dividends for most taxpayers to the tax rate applicable to capital gains,
which is a maximum rate of 5 percent to 15 percent, depending on the taxpayer’s
tax bracket. This change significantly diminishes the degree of “double taxation”
of dividends, which results when the corporation is first taxed on its income and
then shareholders pay taxes on the dividends that they receive. After-tax cash
flow to dividend recipients is much greater at the lower applicable tax rate; the
result is noticeably higher dividend payouts by corporations today than prior to
passage of the 2003 legislation. (For more details on the impact of the 2003 act,
see the Focus on Practice box.)
CHAPTER 14
Payout Policy

focus on PRACTICE
Capital Gains and Dividend Tax Treatment Extended to 2010
Long-term capital gains tax rates were
reduced to the same rates as the new
dividend tax rates through 2010. Pre-
JGTRRA taxation of dividends reappears
in 2011 unless further legislation makes
the law permanent. As this book went to
press in 2010, it was unclear whether
legislators would extend the dividend tax
break beyond 2010. Those arguing for
an extension pointed toward the weak
economy and suggested that taxes
needed to remain low to stimulate busi-
ness investment and job creation. Others
noted that the U.S. budget deficit was at
an all-time high, so some combination of
higher taxes and reduced spending was
necessary to avoid economic problems
associated with too much debt.
3 How might the expected future
reappearance of higher tax rates on
individuals receiving dividends affect
corporate dividend payout policies?
Both the number of companies paying
dividends and the amount of dividends
spiked following the lowering of tax
rates on dividends. For example, total
dividends paid rose almost 14 percent
in the first quarter after the new tax law
was enacted, and the percentage of
firms initiating dividends rose by nearly
40 percent the same quarter.
The tax rates under JGTRRA were
originally programmed to expire at the
end of 2008. However, in May 2006,
Congress passed the Tax Increase
Prevention and Reconciliation Act of
2005 (TIPRA), extending the beneficial
tax rates for 2 more years. Taxpayers in
tax brackets above 15 percent paid a
15 percent rate on dividends paid 
before December 31, 2008. For taxpay-
ers with a marginal tax rate of 15 percent
or lower, the dividend tax rate was 
5 percent until December 31, 2007,
and 0 percent from 2008 to 2010.
In 1980, the percent-
age of firms paying
monthly, quarterly, semiannual, or
annual dividends stood at 60 percent.
By the end of 2002, this had declined
to 20 percent. In May 2003, President
George W. Bush signed into law 
the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief
Reconciliation Act of 2003 (JGTRRA).
Prior to that new law, dividends were
taxed once as part of corporate earn-
ings and again as the personal income
of the investor, in both cases with a
potential top rate of 35 percent. The
result was an effective tax rate of
57.75 percent on some dividends.
Though the 2003 tax law did not com-
pletely eliminate the double taxation of
dividends, it reduced the maximum possi-
ble effect of the double taxation of divi-
dends to 44.75 percent. For taxpayers in
the lower tax brackets, the combined
effect was a maximum of 38.25 percent.
in practice

The board of directors of Espinoza Industries, Inc., on October 4
of the current year, declared a quarterly dividend of $0.46 per
share payable to all holders of record on Friday, October 30, with a payment date
of November 19. Rob and Kate Heckman, who purchased 500 shares of
Espinoza’s common stock on Thursday, October 15, wish to determine whether
they will receive the recently declared dividend and, if so, when and how much
they would net after taxes from the dividend given that the dividends would be
subject to a 15% federal income tax.
Given the Friday, October 30, date of record, the stock would begin selling
ex dividend 2 business days earlier on Wednesday, October 28. Purchasers of the
stock on or before Tuesday, October 27, would receive the right to the dividend.
Because the Heckmans purchased the stock on October 15, they would be eligible
to receive the dividend of $0.46 per share. Thus, the Heckmans will receive $230
in dividends 
, which will be mailed to them on the
November 19 payment date. Because they are subject to a 15% federal income
tax on the dividends, the Heckmans will net $195.50 
after
taxes from the Espinoza Industries dividend.
DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLANS
Today many firms offer dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs), which enable
stockholders to use dividends received on the firm’s stock to acquire additional
shares—even fractional shares—at little or no transaction cost. Some companies
even allow investors to make their initial purchases of the firm’s stock directly
from the company without going through a broker. With DRIPs, plan partici-
pants typically can acquire shares at about 5 percent below the prevailing market
price. From its point of view, the firm can issue new shares to participants more
economically, avoiding the underpricing and flotation costs that would accom-
pany the public sale of new shares. Clearly, the existence of a DRIP may enhance
the market appeal of a firm’s shares.
STOCK PRICE REACTIONS TO CORPORATE PAYOUTS
What happens to the stock price when a firm pays a dividend or repurchases
shares? In theory, the answers to those questions are straightforward. Take a div-
idend payment for example. Suppose a firm has $1 billion in assets, financed
entirely by 10 million shares of common stock. Each share should be worth $100
($1 billion
10,000,000 shares). Now suppose that the firm pays a $1 per share
cash dividend, for a total dividend payout of $10 million. The assets of the firm
fall to $990 million. Because shares outstanding remain at 10 million, each share
should be worth $99. In other words, the stock price should fall by $1, exactly
the amount of the dividend. The reduced share price simply reflects that cash for-
merly held by the firm is now in the hands of investors. To be precise, this reduc-
tion in share price should occur not when the dividend checks are mailed but
rather when the stock begins trading ex dividend.
For share repurchases, the intuition is “you get what you pay for.” In other
words, if the firm buys back shares at the going market price, the reduction in cash
is exactly offset by the reduction in the number of shares outstanding, so the market
price of the stock should remain the same. Once again, consider the firm with

$1 billion in assets and 10 million shares outstanding worth $100 each. Let’s say the
firm decides to distribute $10 million in cash by repurchasing 100,000 shares of
stock. After the repurchase is completed, the firm’s assets will fall by $10 million to
$990 million, but the shares outstanding will fall by 100,000 to 9,900,000. The new
share price is therefore $990,000,000
9,900,000, or $100, as before.
In practice, taxes and a variety of other market imperfections may cause the
actual change in share price in response to a dividend payment or share repur-
chase to deviate from what we expect in theory. Furthermore, the stock price
reaction to a cash payout may be different than the reaction to an announcement
about an upcoming payout. For example, when a firm announces that it will
increase its dividend, the share price usually rises on that news, even though the
share price will fall when the dividend is actually paid. The next section discusses
the impact of payout policy on the value of the firm in greater depth.

CHAPTER 14

14.3 Relevance of Payout Policy
The financial literature has reported numerous theories and empirical findings
concerning payout policy. Although this research provides some interesting
insights about payout policy, capital budgeting and capital structure decisions are
generally considered far more important than payout decisions. In other words,
firms should not sacrifice good investment and financing decisions for a payout
policy of questionable importance.
The most important question about payout policy is this: Does payout policy
have a significant effect on the value of a firm? A number of theoretical and
empirical answers to this question have been proposed, but as yet there is no
widely accepted rule to help a firm find its “optimal” payout policy. Most of the
theories that have been proposed to explain the consequences of payout policy
have focused on dividends. From here on, we will use the terms dividend policy
and payout policy interchangeably, meaning that we make no distinction between
dividend payouts and share repurchases in terms of the theories that try to
explain whether these policies have an effect on firm value.
RESIDUAL THEORY OF DIVIDENDS
The residual theory of dividends is a school of thought that suggests that the divi-
dend paid by a firm should be viewed as a residual—the amount left over after all
acceptable investment opportunities have been undertaken. Using this approach,
the firm would treat the dividend decision in three steps, as follows:
Step 1
Determine its optimal level of capital expenditures, which would be the
level that exploits all of a firm’s positive NPV projects.
LG 2
residual theory of dividends
A school of thought that
suggests that the dividend paid
by a firm should be viewed as
a residual—the amount left
over after all acceptable
investment opportunities have
been undertaken.

Step 2
Using the optimal capital structure proportions (see Chapter 13), esti-
mate the total amount of equity financing needed to support the expen-
ditures generated in Step 1.
Step 3
Because the cost of retained earnings, rr, is less than the cost of new
common stock, rn, use retained earnings to meet the equity requirement
determined in Step 2. If retained earnings are inadequate to meet this need,
sell new common stock. If the available retained earnings are in excess of
this need, distribute the surplus amount—the residual—as dividends.
According to this approach, as long as the firm’s equity need exceeds the amount
of retained earnings, no cash dividend is paid. The argument for this approach is
that it is sound management to be certain that the company has the money it
needs to compete effectively. This view of dividends suggests that the required
return of investors, rs, is not influenced by the firm’s dividend policy—a premise
that in turn implies that dividend policy is irrelevant in the sense that it does not
affect firm value.
THE DIVIDEND IRRELEVANCE THEORY
The residual theory of dividends implies that if the firm cannot invest its earnings
to earn a return that exceeds the cost of capital it should distribute the earnings
by paying dividends to stockholders. This approach suggests that dividends rep-
resent an earnings residual rather than an active decision variable that affects the
firm’s value. Such a view is consistent with the dividend irrelevance theory put
forth by Merton H. Miller and Franco Modigliani (M and M).2 They argue that
the firm’s value is determined solely by the earning power and risk of its assets
(investments) and that the manner in which it splits its earnings stream between
dividends and internally retained (and reinvested) funds does not affect this
value. M and M’s theory suggests that in a perfect world (certainty, no taxes, no
transactions costs, and no other market imperfections), the value of the firm is
unaffected by the distribution of dividends.
Of course, real markets do not satisfy the “perfect markets” assumptions of
Modigliani and Miller’s original theory. One market imperfection that may be
important is taxation. Historically, dividends have usually been taxed at higher
rates than capital gains. A firm that pays out its earnings as dividends may trigger
higher tax liabilities for its investors than a firm that retains earnings. As a firm
retains earnings, its share price should rise, and investors enjoy capital gains.
Investors can defer paying taxes on these gains indefinitely simply by not selling
their shares. Even if they do sell their shares, they may pay a relatively low tax rate
on the capital gains. In contrast, when a firm pays dividends, investors receive
cash immediately and pay taxes at the rates dictated by then-current tax laws.
Even though this discussion makes it seem that retaining profits rather than
paying them out as dividends may be better for shareholders on an after-tax
basis, Modigliani and Miller argue that this may not be the case. They observe
that not all investors are subject to income taxation. Some institutional investors,
such as pension funds, do not pay taxes on the dividends and capital gains that

they earn. For these investors, the payout policies of different firms have no
impact on the taxes that investors have to pay. Therefore, Modigliani and Miller
argue, there can be a clientele effect in which different types of investors are
attracted to firms with different payout policies due to tax effects. Tax-exempt
investors may invest more heavily in firms that pay dividends because they are
not affected by the typically higher tax rates on dividends. Investors who would
have to pay higher taxes on dividends may prefer to invest in firms that retain
more earnings rather than paying dividends. If a firm changes its payout policy,
the value of the firm will not change—what will change is the type of investor
who holds the firm’s shares. According to this argument, tax clienteles mean that
payout policies cannot affect firm value, but they can affect the ownership base of
the company.
In summary, M and M and other proponents of dividend irrelevance argue
that, all else being equal, an investor’s required return—and therefore the value of
the firm—is unaffected by dividend policy. In other words, there is no “optimal”
dividend policy for a particular firm.
ARGUMENTS FOR DIVIDEND RELEVANCE
Modigliani and Miller’s assertion that dividend policy was irrelevant was a radical
idea when it was first proposed. The prevailing wisdom at the time was that payout
policy could improve the value of the firm and therefore was relevant. The key
argument in support of dividend relevance theory is attributed to Myron J. Gordon
and John Lintner,3 who suggest that there is, in fact, a direct relationship between
the firm’s dividend policy and its market value. Fundamental to this proposition is
their bird-in-the-hand argument, which suggests that investors see current divi-
dends as less risky than future dividends or capital gains: “A bird in the hand is
worth two in the bush.” Gordon and Lintner argue that current dividend payments
reduce investor uncertainty, causing investors to discount the firm’s earnings at a
lower rate and, all else being equal, to place a higher value on the firm’s stock.
Conversely, if dividends are reduced or are not paid, investor uncertainty will
increase, raising the required return and lowering the stock’s value.
Modigliani and Miller argued that the bird-in-the-hand theory was a fallacy.
They said that investors who want immediate cash flow from a firm that did not
pay dividends could simply sell off a portion of their shares. Remember, the stock
price of a firm that retains earnings should rise over time as cash builds up inside
the firm. By selling a few shares every quarter or every year, investors could,
according to Modigliani and Miller, replicate the same cash flow stream that they
would have received if the firm had paid dividends rather than retaining earnings.
Studies have shown that large changes in dividends do affect share price.
Increases in dividends result in increased share price, and decreases in dividends
result in decreased share price. One interpretation of this evidence is that it is not
the dividends per se that matter but rather the informational content of dividends
with respect to future earnings. In other words, investors view a change in divi-
dends, up or down, as a signal that management expects future earnings to
change in the same direction. Investors view an increase in dividends as a positive

signal, and they bid up the share price. They view a decrease in dividends as a
negative signal that causes investors to sell their shares, resulting in the share
price decreasing.
Another argument in support of the idea that dividends can affect the value
of the firm is the agency cost theory. Recall that agency costs are costs that arise
due to the separation between the firm’s owners and its managers. Managers
sometimes have different interests than owners. Managers may want to retain
earnings simply to increase the size of the firm’s asset base. There is greater pres-
tige and perhaps higher compensation associated with running a larger firm.
Shareholders are aware of the temptations that managers face, and they worry
that retained earnings may not be invested wisely. The agency cost theory says
that a firm that commits to paying dividends is reassuring shareholders that man-
agers will not waste their money. Given this reassurance, investors will pay higher
prices for firms that promise regular dividend payments.
Although many other arguments related to dividend relevance have been put
forward, empirical studies have not provided evidence that conclusively settles
the debate about whether and how payout policy affects firm value. As we have
already said, even if dividend policy really matters, it is almost certainly less
important than other decisions that financial mangers make, such as the decision
to invest in a large new project or the decision about what combination of debt
and equity the firm should use to finance its operations. Still, most financial man-
agers today, especially those running large corporations, believe that payout
policy can affect the value of the firm.

14.4 Factors Affecting Dividend Policy
The firm’s dividend policy represents a plan of action to be followed whenever it
makes a dividend decision. Firms develop policies consistent with their goals.
Before we review some of the popular types of dividend policies, we discuss six
factors that firms consider in establishing a dividend policy. They are legal con-
straints, contractual constraints, the firm’s growth prospects, owner considera-
tions, and market considerations.
LEGAL CONSTRAINTS
Most states prohibit corporations from paying out as cash dividends any portion
of the firm’s “legal capital,” which is typically measured by the par value of
common stock. Other states define legal capital to include not only the par value
of the common stock but also any paid-in capital in excess of par. These capital
impairment restrictions are generally established to provide a sufficient equity
base to protect creditors’ claims. An example will clarify the differing definitions
of capital.

processor, is presented in the following table.

575
4. A firm that has an operating loss in the current period can still pay cash dividends as long as sufficient retained
earnings against which to charge the dividend are available and, of course, as long as it has the cash with which to
make the payments.

140,000
In states where the firm’s legal capital is defined as the par value of its common
stock, the firm could pay out $340,000 
in cash dividends
without impairing its capital. In states where the firm’s legal capital includes all
paid-in capital, the firm could pay out only $140,000 in cash dividends.
Firms sometimes impose an earnings requirement limiting the amount of div-
idends. With this restriction, the firm cannot pay more in cash dividends than the
sum of its most recent and past retained earnings. However, the firm is not pro-
hibited from paying more in dividends than its current earnings.4
Assume that Miller Flour Company, from the preceding example, in the year just
ended has $30,000 in earnings available for common stock dividends. As the
table in Example 14.4 indicates, the firm has past retained earnings of $140,000.
Thus it can legally pay dividends of up to $170,000.
If a firm has overdue liabilities or is legally insolvent or bankrupt, most states
prohibit its payment of cash dividends. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service
prohibits firms from accumulating earnings to reduce the owners’ taxes. If the
IRS can determine that a firm has accumulated an excess of earnings to allow
owners to delay paying ordinary income taxes on dividends received, it may levy
an excess earnings accumulation tax on any retained earnings above $250,000
for most businesses.
During the recent financial crisis, a number of financial institutions received
federal financial assistance. Those firms had to agree to restrictions on dividend
payments to shareholders until they repaid the money that they received from the
government. Bank of America, for example, had more than 30 years of consecu-
tive dividend increases before accepting federal bailout money. As part of their
bailout, Bank of America had to cut dividends to $0.01 per share.

retained earnings above
$250,000 for most businesses
when it determines that the firm
has accumulated an excess of
earnings to allow owners to

taxes on dividends received.

CONTRACTUAL CONSTRAINTS
Often the firm’s ability to pay cash dividends is constrained by restrictive provi-
sions in a loan agreement. Generally, these constraints prohibit the payment of
cash dividends until the firm achieves a certain level of earnings, or they may limit
dividends to a certain dollar amount or percentage of earnings. Constraints on
dividends help to protect creditors from losses due to the firm’s insolvency.
GROWTH PROSPECTS
The firm’s financial requirements are directly related to how much it expects to
grow and what assets it will need to acquire. It must evaluate its profitability and
risk to develop insight into its ability to raise capital externally. In addition, the
firm must determine the cost and speed with which it can obtain financing.
Generally, a large, mature firm has adequate access to new capital, whereas a rap-
idly growing firm may not have sufficient funds available to support its accept-
able projects. A growth firm is likely to have to depend heavily on internal
financing through retained earnings, so it is likely to pay out only a very small
percentage of its earnings as dividends. A more established firm is in a better posi-
tion to pay out a large proportion of its earnings, particularly if it has ready
sources of financing.
OWNER CONSIDERATIONS
The firm must establish a policy that has a favorable effect on the wealth of the
majority of owners. One consideration is the tax status of a firm’s owners. If a
firm has a large percentage of wealthy stockholders who have sizable incomes, it
may decide to pay out a lower percentage of its earnings to allow the owners to
delay the payment of taxes until they sell the stock. Because cash dividends are
taxed at the same rate as capital gains (as a result of the 2003 Tax Act), this
strategy benefits owners through the tax deferral rather than as a result of a lower
tax rate. Lower-income shareholders, however, who need dividend income, will
prefer a higher payout of earnings.
A second consideration is the owners’ investment opportunities. A firm
should not retain funds for investment in projects yielding lower returns than the
owners could obtain from external investments of equal risk. If it appears that the
owners have better opportunities externally, the firm should pay out a higher per-
centage of its earnings. If the firm’s investment opportunities are at least as good
as similar-risk external investments, a lower payout is justifiable.
A final consideration is the potential dilution of ownership. If a firm pays out
a high percentage of earnings, new equity capital will have to be raised with
common stock. The result of a new stock issue may be dilution of both control
and earnings for the existing owners. By paying out a low percentage of its earn-
ings, the firm can minimize the possibility of such dilution.
MARKET CONSIDERATIONS
One of the more recent theories proposed to explain firms’ payout decisions is
called the catering theory. According to the catering theory, investors’ demands
for dividends fluctuate over time. For example, during an economic boom
accompanied by a rising stock market, investors may be more attracted to stocks

that offer prospects of large capital gains. When the economy is in recession and
the stock market is falling, investors may prefer the security of a dividend. The
catering theory suggests that firms are more likely to initiate dividend payments
or to increase existing payouts when investors exhibit a strong preference for div-
idends. Firms cater to the preferences of investors.

14–9 What five factors do firms consider in establishing dividend policy?
Briefly describe each of them.
CHAPTER 14
Payout Policy
577
14.5 Types of Dividend Policies
The firm’s dividend policy must be formulated with two basic objectives in mind:
providing for sufficient financing and maximizing the wealth of the firm’s
owners. Three different dividend policies are described in the following sections.
A particular firm’s cash dividend policy may incorporate elements of each.
CONSTANT-PAYOUT-RATIO DIVIDEND POLICY
One type of dividend policy involves use of a constant payout ratio. The dividend
payout ratio indicates the percentage of each dollar earned that the firm distrib-
utes to the owners in the form of cash. It is calculated by dividing the firm’s cash
dividend per share by its earnings per share. With a constant-payout-ratio divi-
dend policy, the firm establishes that a certain percentage of earnings is paid to
owners in each dividend period.
The problem with this policy is that if the firm’s earnings drop or if a loss
occurs in a given period, the dividends may be low or even nonexistent. Because
dividends are often considered an indicator of the firm’s future condition and
status, the firm’s stock price may be adversely affected.
Peachtree Industries, a miner of potassium, has a policy of paying out 40% of
earnings in cash dividends. In periods when a loss occurs, the firm’s policy is to
pay no cash dividends. Data on Peachtree’s earnings, dividends, and average
stock prices for the past 6 years follow.

Dividends increased in 2010 and in 2011 but decreased in the other years. In
years of decreasing dividends, the firm’s stock price dropped; when dividends
increased, the price of the stock increased. Peachtree’s sporadic dividend pay-
ments appear to make its owners uncertain about the returns they can expect.
REGULAR DIVIDEND POLICY
The regular dividend policy is based on the payment of a fixed-dollar dividend in
each period. Often, firms that use this policy increase the regular dividend once a
sustainable increase in earnings has occurred. Under this policy, dividends are
almost never decreased.
The dividend policy of Woodward Laboratories, a producer of a popular artifi-
cial sweetener, is to pay annual dividends of $1.00 per share until per-share earn-
ings have exceeded $4.00 for 3 consecutive years. At that point, the annual
dividend is raised to $1.50 per share, and a new earnings plateau is established.
The firm does not anticipate decreasing its dividend unless its liquidity is in jeop-
ardy. Data for Woodward’s earnings, dividends, and average stock prices for the
past 12 years follow.

Whatever the level of earnings, Woodward Laboratories paid dividends of
$1.00 per share through 2009. In 2010, the dividend increased to $1.50 per share
because earnings in excess of $4.00 per share had been achieved for 3 years. In
2010, the firm also had to establish a new earnings plateau for further dividend
increases. Woodward Laboratories’ average price per share exhibited a stable,
increasing behavior in spite of a somewhat volatile pattern of earnings.
Often a regular dividend policy is built around a target dividend-payout
ratio. Under this policy, the firm attempts to pay out a certain percentage of earn-
ings, but rather than let dividends fluctuate it pays a stated dollar dividend and
adjusts that dividend toward the target payout as proven earnings increases
occur. For instance, Woodward Laboratories appears to have a target payout

ratio of around 35 percent. The payout was about 35 percent ($1.00
$2.85)
when the dividend policy was set in 2001, and, when the dividend was raised to
$1.50 in 2010, the payout ratio was about 33 percent ($1.50
$4.60).
LOW-REGULAR-AND-EXTRA DIVIDEND POLICY
Some firms establish a low-regular-and-extra dividend policy, paying a low reg-
ular dividend, supplemented by an additional (“extra”) dividend when earnings
are higher than normal in a given period. By calling the additional dividend an
extra dividend, the firm avoids setting expectations that the dividend increase
will be permanent. This policy is especially common among companies that expe-
rience cyclical shifts in earnings.
By establishing a low regular dividend that is paid each period, the firm gives
investors the stable income necessary to build confidence in the firm, and the
extra dividend permits them to share in the earnings from an especially good
period. Firms using this policy must raise the level of the regular dividend once
proven increases in earnings have been achieved. The extra dividend should not be
a regular event; otherwise, it becomes meaningless. The use of a target dividend-
payout ratio in establishing the regular dividend level is advisable.

14.6 Other Forms of Dividends
Two common transactions that bear some resemblance to cash dividends are
stock dividends and stock splits. Although the stock dividends and stock splits
are closely related to each other, their economic effects are quite different than
those of cash dividends or share repurchases.
STOCK DIVIDENDS
A stock dividend is the payment, to existing owners, of a dividend in the form of
stock. Often firms pay stock dividends as a replacement for or a supplement to
cash dividends. In a stock dividend, investors simply receive additional shares in
proportion to the shares they already own. No cash is distributed, and no real
value is transferred from the firm to investors. Instead, because the number of
outstanding shares increases, the stock price declines roughly in line with the
amount of the stock dividend.
Accounting Aspects
In an accounting sense, the payment of a stock dividend is a shifting of funds
between stockholders’ equity accounts rather than an outflow of funds. When a
firm declares a stock dividend, the procedures for announcement and distribution

LG 6

are the same as those described earlier for a cash dividend. The accounting entries
associated with the payment of a stock dividend vary depending on its size. A
small (ordinary) stock dividend is a stock dividend that represents less than 
20 percent to 25 percent of the common stock outstanding when the dividend is
declared. Small stock dividends are most common.
The current stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet of Garrison Corporation, a
distributor of prefabricated cabinets, is as shown in the following accounts.
Preferred stock

Common stock (100,000 shares at $4 par)
400,000
Paid-in capital in excess of par

Retained earnings
Total stockholders’ equity
Garrison, which has 100,000 shares of common stock outstanding, declares
a 10% stock dividend when the market price of its stock is $15 per share.
Because 10,000 new shares (10% of 100,000) are issued at the prevailing market
price of $15 per share, $150,000 ($15 per share
10,000 shares) is shifted from
retained earnings to the common stock and paid-in capital accounts. A total of
$40,000 ($4 par
10,000 shares) is added to common stock, and the remaining
is added to the paid-in capital in excess
of par. The resulting account balances are as follows:
Preferred stock

Common stock (110,000 shares at $4 par)
440,000
Paid-in capital in excess of par
710,000
Retained earnings
Total stockholders’ equity
The firm’s total stockholders’ equity has not changed; funds have merely been
shifted among stockholders’ equity accounts.
Shareholder’s Viewpoint
The shareholder receiving a stock dividend typically receives nothing of value.
After the dividend is paid, the per-share value of the shareholder’s stock decreases
in proportion to the dividend in such a way that the market value of his or her total
holdings in the firm remains unchanged. Therefore stock dividends are usually non-
taxable. The shareholder’s proportion of ownership in the firm also remains the
same, and as long as the firm’s earnings remain unchanged, so does his or her share
of total earnings. (However, if the firm’s earnings and cash dividends increase when
the stock dividend is issued, an increase in share value is likely to result.)
Ms. X owned 10,000 shares of Garrison Corporation’s stock. The company’s most
recent earnings were $220,000, and earnings are not expected to change in the near
future. Before the stock dividend, Ms. X owned 10% (10,000 shares
100,000
shares) of the firm’s stock, which was selling for $15 per share. Earnings per share

were $2.20 ($220,000
100,000 shares). Because Ms. X owned 10,000 shares,
her earnings were $22,000 ($2.20 per share
10,000 shares). After receiving the
10% stock dividend, Ms. X has 11,000 shares, which again is 10% of the owner-
ship (11,000 shares
110,000 shares). The market price of the stock can be
expected to drop to $13.64 per share [$15
(1.00
1.10)], which means that the
market value of Ms. X’s holdings is $150,000 (11,000 shares
$13.64 per share).
This is the same as the initial value of her holdings (10,000 shares
$15 per
share). The future earnings per share drops to $2 ($220,000
110,000 shares)
because the same $220,000 in earnings must now be divided among 110,000
shares. Because Ms. X still owns 10% of the stock, her share of total earnings is
still $22,000 ($2 per share
11,000 shares).
In summary, if the firm’s earnings remain constant and total cash dividends
do not increase, a stock dividend results in a lower per-share market value for the
firm’s stock.
The Company’s Viewpoint
Stock dividends are more costly to issue than cash dividends, but certain advan-
tages may outweigh these costs. Firms find the stock dividend to be a way to give
owners something without having to use cash. Generally, when a firm needs to
preserve cash to finance rapid growth, it uses a stock dividend. When the stock-
holders recognize that the firm is reinvesting the cash flow so as to maximize
future earnings, the market value of the firm should at least remain unchanged.
However, if the stock dividend is paid so as to retain cash to satisfy past-due bills,
a decline in market value may result.
STOCK SPLITS
Although not a type of dividend, stock splits have an effect on a firm’s share price
similar to that of stock dividends. A stock split is a method commonly used to
lower the market price of a firm’s stock by increasing the number of shares
belonging to each shareholder. In a 2-for-1 split, for example, two new shares are
exchanged for each old share, with each new share being worth half the value of
each old share. A stock split has no effect on the firm’s capital structure and is
usually nontaxable.
Quite often, a firm believes that its stock is priced too high and that lowering
the market price will enhance trading activity. Stock splits are often made prior to
issuing additional stock to enhance that stock’s marketability and stimulate
market activity. It is not unusual for a stock split to cause a slight increase in the
market value of the stock, attributable to its informational content and to the fact
that total dividends paid commonly increase slightly after a split.5

Information,” International Economic Review 10 (February 1969), pp. 1–21, found that the stock price increases
before the split announcement and that the increase in stock price is maintained if dividends per share are increased
but is lost if dividends per share are not increased, following the split.

Delphi Company, a forest products concern, had 200,000 shares of $2-par-value

The insignificant effect of the stock split on the firm’s books is obvious.
Stock can be split in any way desired. Sometimes a reverse stock split is made:
The firm exchanges a certain number of outstanding shares for one new share. For
example, in a 1-for-3 split, one new share is exchanged for three old shares. In a
reverse stock split, the firm’s stock price rises due to the reduction in shares out-
standing. Firms may conduct a reverse split if their stock price is getting so low
that the exchange where the stock trades threatens to delist the stock. For
example, the New York Stock Exchange requires that the average closing price of
a listed security must be no less than $1 over any consecutive 30-day trading
period. In June of 2010, the video chain Blockbuster asked shareholders to
approve a reverse stock split to prevent the NYSE from delisting Blockbuster’s
stock. Shareholders didn’t approve the measure, and the NYSE delisted
Blockbuster stock the following month.
Shakira Washington, a single investor in the 25% federal
income tax bracket, owns 260 shares of Advanced Technology,
Inc., common stock. She originally bought the stock 2 years ago at its initial
public offering (IPO) price of $9 per share. The stock of this fast-growing tech-
nology company is currently trading for $60 per share, so the current value of her
Advanced Technology stock is $15,600 (260 shares
$60 per share). Because
the firm’s board believes that the stock would trade more actively in the $20 to
$30 price range, it just announced a 3-for-1 stock split. Shakira wishes to deter-
mine the impact of the stock split on her holdings and taxes.
Because the stock will split 3 for 1, after the split Shakira will own 780 shares
(3
260 shares). She should expect the market price of the stock to drop to $20
(1/3
$60) immediately after the split; the value of her after-split holding will be
$15,600 (780 shares
$20 per share). Because the $15,600 value of her after-
split holdings in Advanced Technology stock exactly equals the before-split value
of $15,600, Shakira has experienced neither a gain nor a loss on the stock as a
result of the 3-for-1 split. Even if there were a gain or loss attributable to the split,
Shakira would not have any tax liability unless she actually sold the stock and
realized that (or any other) gain or loss.

FOCUS ON VALUE
Payout policy refers to the cash flows that a firm distributes to its common
stockholders. A share of common stock gives its owner the right to receive all
future dividends. The present value of all those future dividends expected over a
firm’s assumed infinite life determines the firm’s stock value.
Corporate payouts not only represent cash flows to shareholders but also
contain useful information about the firm’s current and future performance.
Such information affects the shareholders’ perception of the firm’s risk. A firm
can also pay stock dividends, initiate stock splits, or repurchase stock. All of
these dividend-related actions can affect the firm’s risk, return, and value as a
result of their cash flows and informational content.
Although the theory of relevance of dividends is still evolving, the behavior
of most firms and stockholders suggests that dividend policy affects share prices.
Therefore financial managers try to develop and implement dividend policy that
is consistent with the firm’s goal of maximizing stock price.
REVIEW OF LEARNING GOALS
Understand cash payout procedures, their tax treatment, and the role of
dividend reinvestment plans. The board of directors makes the cash payout deci-
sion and, for dividends, establishes the record and payment dates. As a result of
a tax-law change in 2003, most taxpayers pay taxes on corporate dividends at a
maximum rate of 5 percent to 15 percent, depending on the taxpayer’s tax
bracket. Some firms offer dividend reinvestment plans that allow stockholders
to acquire shares in lieu of cash dividends.
Describe the residual theory of dividends and the key arguments with regard
to dividend irrelevance and relevance. The residual theory suggests that dividends
should be viewed as the earnings left after all acceptable investment opportunities
have been undertaken. Miller and Modigliani argue in favor of dividend irrelevance,
using a perfect world in which market imperfections such as transaction costs and
taxes do not exist. Gordon and Lintner advance the theory of dividend relevance,
basing their argument on the uncertainty-reducing effect of dividends, supported by
their bird-in-the-hand argument. Empirical studies fail to provide clear support of
dividend relevance. Even so, the actions of financial managers and stockholders tend
to support the belief that dividend policy does affect stock value.
Discuss the key factors involved in establishing a dividend policy. A
firm’s dividend policy should provide for sufficient financing and maximize
LG 3
LG 2
LG 1

stockholders’ wealth. Dividend policy is affected by legal and contractual con-
straints, by growth prospects, and by owner and market considerations. Legal
constraints prohibit corporations from paying out as cash dividends any portion
of the firm’s “legal capital.” Nor can firms with overdue liabilities and legally
insolvent or bankrupt firms pay cash dividends. Contractual constraints result
from restrictive provisions in the firm’s loan agreements. Growth prospects
affect the relative importance of retaining earnings rather than paying them out
in dividends. The tax status of owners, the owners’ investment opportunities,
and the potential dilution of ownership are important owner considerations.
Finally, market considerations are related to the stockholders’ preference for the
continuous payment of fixed or increasing streams of dividends.
Review and evaluate the three basic types of dividend policies. With a
constant-payout-ratio dividend policy, the firm pays a fixed percentage of earn-
ings to the owners each period; dividends move up and down with earnings, and
no dividend is paid when a loss occurs. Under a regular dividend policy, the firm
pays a fixed-dollar dividend each period; it increases the amount of dividends
only after a proven increase in earnings. The low-regular-and-extra dividend
policy is similar to the regular dividend policy, except that it pays an extra divi-
dend when the firm’s earnings are higher than normal.
Evaluate stock dividends from accounting, shareholder, and company
points of view. Firms may pay stock dividends as a replacement for or supple-
ment to cash dividends. The payment of stock dividends involves a shifting of
funds between capital accounts rather than an outflow of funds. Stock dividends
do not change the market value of stockholders’ holdings, proportion of owner-
ship, or share of total earnings. Therefore, stock dividends are usually nontax-
able. However, stock dividends may satisfy owners and enable the firm to
preserve its market value without having to use cash.
Explain stock splits and the firm’s motivation for undertaking them.
Stock splits are used to enhance trading activity of a firm’s shares by lowering or
raising their market price. A stock split merely involves accounting adjustments;
it has no effect on the firm’s cash or on its capital structure and is usually non-
taxable.
Firms can repurchase stock in lieu of paying a cash dividend, to retire out-
standing shares. Reducing the number of outstanding shares increases earnings
per share and the market price per share. Stock repurchases also defer the tax
payments of stockholders.

Spreadsheet Exercise
One way to lower the market price of a firm’s stock is via a stock split. Rock-O
Corporation finds itself in a different situation: Its stock has been selling at relatively
low prices. To increase the market price of the stock, the company chooses to use a
reverse stock split of 2-for-3.
The company currently has 700,000 common shares outstanding and no preferred
stock. The common stock carries a par value of $1. At this time, the paid-in capital in
excess of par is $7,000,000, and the firm’s retained earnings are $3,500,000.
TO DO
Create a spreadsheet to determine the following:

O’Grady Apparel Company
O
’Grady Apparel Company was founded nearly 160 years ago when an Irish mer-
chant named Garrett O’Grady landed in Los Angeles with an inventory of heavy
canvas, which he hoped to sell for tents and wagon covers to miners headed for the
California goldfields. Instead, he turned to the sale of harder-wearing clothing.
Today, O’Grady Apparel Company is a small manufacturer of fabrics and
clothing whose stock is traded in the OTC market. In 2012, the Los Angeles–based
company experienced sharp increases in both domestic and European markets
resulting in record earnings. Sales rose from $15.9 million in 2008 to $18.3 million
in 2012 with earnings per share of $3.28 and $3.84, respectively.
European sales represented 29% of total sales in 2012, up from 24% the year
before and only 3% in 2007, 1 year after foreign operations were launched.
Although foreign sales represent nearly one-third of total sales, the growth in the
domestic market is expected to affect the company most markedly. Management
expects sales to surpass $21 million in 2013, and earnings per share are expected to
rise to $4.40. (Selected income statement items are presented in Table 1.)
Because of the recent growth, Margaret Jennings, the corporate treasurer, is con-
cerned that available funds are not being used to their fullest potential. The pro-
jected $1,300,000 of internally generated 2013 funds is expected to be insufficient to
meet the company’s expansion needs. Management has set a policy of maintaining
the current capital structure proportions of 25% long-term debt, 10% preferred
stock, and 65% common stock equity for at least the next 3 years. In addition, it
plans to continue paying out 40% of its earnings as dividends. Total capital expendi-
tures are yet to be determined.
Jennings has been presented with several competing investment opportunities by
division and product managers. However, because funds are limited, choices of
which projects to accept must be made. A list of investment opportunities is shown
in Table 2. To analyze the effect of the increased financing requirements on the
weighted average cost of capital (WACC), Jennings contacted a leading investment
banking firm that provided the financing cost data given in Table 3. O’Grady is in
the 40% tax bracket.

Financing Cost Data
Long-term debt: The firm can raise $700,000 of additional debt by selling 10-year, $1,000,
12% annual interest rate bonds to net $970 after flotation costs. Any debt in excess of
$700,000 will have a before-tax cost, rd, of 18%.
Preferred stock: Preferred stock, regardless of the amount sold, can be issued with a $60 par
value and a 17% annual dividend rate. It will net $57 per share after flotation costs.
Common stock equity: The firm expects its dividends and earnings to continue to grow at a
constant rate of 15% per year. The firm’s stock is currently selling for $20 per share. The firm
expects to have $1,300,000 of available retained earnings. Once the retained earnings have
been exhausted, the firm can raise additional funds by selling new common stock, netting 
$16 per share after underpricing and flotation costs.

b. (1) Determine the break point associated with common equity. A break point
represents the total amount of financing that the firm can raise before it trig-
gers an increase in the cost of a particular financing source. For example,
O’Grady plans to use 25% long-term debt in its capital structure. That
means that for every $1 in debt that the firm uses, it will use $3 from other

596
financing sources (total financing is then $4, and because $1 comes from
long-term debt, it’s share in the total is the desired 25%). From Table 3, 
we see that after the firm raises $700,000 in long-term debt, the cost of this
financing source begins to rise. Therefore, the firm can raise total capital 
of $2.8 million before the cost of debt will rise ($700,000 in debt plus 
$2.1 million in other sources to maintain the 25% proportion for debt).
Therefore, $2.8 million is the break point for debt. If the firms wants to
maintain a capital structure with 25% long-term debt and it also wants to
raise more than $2.8 million in total financing, then it will require more
than $700,000 in long-term debt, and it will trigger the higher cost of the
additional debt it issues beyond $700,000.
(2) Using the break points developed in part (1), determine each of the ranges 
of total new financing over which the firm’s weighted average cost of capital
(WACC) remains constant.
(3) Calculate the weighted average cost of capital for each range of total new
financing. Draw a graph with the WACC on the vertical axis and total
money raised on the horizontal axis, and show how the firm’s WACC
increases in “steps” as the amount of money raised increases.
c. (1) Sort the investment opportunities described in Table 2 from highest to lowest
return, and plot a line on the graph you drew in part (3) above showing how
much money is required to fund the investments, starting with the highest
return and going to the lowest. In other words, this line will plot the relation-
ship between the IRR on the firm’s investments and the total financing
required to undertake those investments.
(2) Which, if any, of the available investments would you recommend that the
firm accept? Explain your answer.
d. (1) Assuming that the specific financing costs do not change, what effect would
a shift to a more highly leveraged capital structure consisting of 50% long-
term debt, 10% preferred stock, and 40% common stock have on your pre-
vious findings? (Note: Rework parts b and c using these capital structure
weights.)
(2) Which capital structure—the original one or this one—seems better? Why?
e. (1) What type of dividend policy does the firm appear to employ? Does it seem
appropriate given the firm’s recent growth in sales and profits and given its
current investment opportunities?
(2) Would you recommend an alternative dividend policy? Explain. How would
this policy affect the investments recommended in part c(2)?

hort-term financial decisions are guided by the same financial management
principles as long-term financial decisions, but the time frame is different: days,
weeks, and months rather than years. Working capital management focuses on the
management of short-term cash flows by evaluating their timing, risk, and impact on
firm value. While long-term financial decisions ultimately determine the firm’s ability to
maximize shareholder wealth, there may not be a long term if financial managers fail
to make effective short-term financial decisions.
Chapter 15 discusses the techniques and strategies for managing working capital and
current assets. The fundamentals of net working capital and the importance of the cash
conversion cycle are introduced. Chapter 16 discusses the importance of controlling
accounts payable expenses and managing other current liabilities. You will learn how
some companies use current liabilities, including accounts payable, accruals, lines of
credit, commercial paper, and short-term loans, to finance current assets. Successful
adherence to the fundamentals of working capital management will help ensure that
the firm can meet its operating obligations and maximize its long-term investments.

Why This Chapter Matters to You
In your professional life
ACCOUNTING You need to understand the cash conversion cycle and
the management of inventory, accounts receivable, and receipts and
disbursements of cash.
INFORMATION SYSTEMS You need to understand the cash conversion
cycle, inventory, accounts receivable, and receipts and disbursements
of cash to design financial information systems that facilitate effective
working capital management.
MANAGEMENT You need to understand the management of working
capital so that you can efficiently manage current assets and decide
whether to finance the firm’s funds requirements aggressively or conser-
vatively.
MARKETING You need to understand credit selection and monitoring
because sales will be affected by the availability of credit to pur-
chasers; sales will also be affected by inventory management.
OPERATIONS You need to understand the cash conversion cycle
because you will be responsible for reducing the cycle through the effi-
cient management of production, inventory, and costs.
You often will be faced with short-
term purchasing decisions, which
tend to focus on consumable items. Many involve trade-offs between
quantity and price: Should you buy large quantities in order to pay a
lower unit price, hold the items, and use them over time? Or should you
buy smaller quantities more frequently and pay a slightly higher unit
price? Analyzing these types of short-term purchasing decisions will
help you make the most of your money.

Focusing on Working Capital
A
global specialty chemicals and materials com-
pany, Cytec Industries sells products to compa-
nies in a variety of industries, including aerospace,
adhesive, automotive and industrial coatings, chemical
intermediates, inks, mining, and plastics. Like a lot of
companies, Cytec has come to realize the importance
of focusing on working capital.
“As the economy began to deteriorate in late
2008, we recognized the opportunity to accelerate
our focus on improving working capital performance.
We understood it was a critical strategy to enable investments in the businesses that could shape
our future,” David Drillock, Cytec’s vice president and chief financial officer, said. Cytec’s
working capital had been increasing as a result of growth and acquisitions, and the company’s
internal analysis showed an opportunity to reduce working capital by more than $200 million.
Cytec’s leadership was convinced that it needed to change its culture and improve metrics
and reporting capabilities, so that a focus on working capital could be embedded effectively
into decision making throughout the organization. Scott Hain, Vice President, Global Supply
Chain, Cytec Specialty Chemicals, said, “As they made day-to-day decisions, we wanted our
people to understand and consider how their actions might affect working capital.”
Within a few months of implementing new working capital management strategies, 
Cytec executives observed the organization’s culture changing. “Once people saw the successes,
everyone wanted to be involved,” said Hain. Cytec management continually communicated
progress and successes widely, and regular departmental and management meetings were 
reorganized to focus on the metrics that drive working capital. Additionally, Cytec’s incentive 
compensation structure was modified at all levels to reward individuals for achieving working 
capital goals.
By the end of 2009, Cytec had accomplished a near 40 percent reduction in working
capital, surpassing its initial working capital reduction goals. Through a combination of changes
to its receivables, inventory management, and payables processes, Cytec is now better able to
turn working capital into cash. By addressing its approach to working capital management,
Cytec remained focused on its future vision for growth and was able to continue investing in the
businesses that are critical to that vision.

15.1 Net Working Capital Fundamentals
The firm’s balance sheet provides information about the structure of the firm’s
investments on the one hand and the structure of its financing sources on the
other hand. The structures chosen should consistently lead to the maximization
of the value of the owners’ investment in the firm.
WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The importance of efficient working capital management is indisputable given
that a firm’s viability relies on the financial manager’s ability to effectively manage
receivables, inventory, and payables. The goal of working capital (or short-term
financial) management is to manage each of the firm’s current assets (inventory,
accounts receivable, marketable securities, and cash) and current liabilities (notes
payable, accruals, and accounts payable) to achieve a balance between profitability
and risk that contributes positively to the firm’s value.
Firms are able to reduce financing costs or increase the funds available for
expansion by minimizing the amount of funds tied up in working capital.
Therefore, it should not be surprising to learn that working capital is one of the
financial manager’s most important and time-consuming activities. A study of
Fortune 1000 firms found that more than one-third of financial managers’ time is
spent managing current assets and about one-fourth of their time is spent man-
aging current liabilities.1

Views (January 2006), pp. 1–104.
Matter of fact
A
survey of CFOs from firms around the world suggests that working capital management is
atop the list of most valued finance functions. Among 19 different finance functions, CFOs
viewed working capital management as equally important as capital structure, debt issuance
and management, bank relationships, and tax management. Their satisfaction with the per-
formance of working capital management was quite the opposite, however. CFOs viewed the
performance of working capital management as being better only than the performance of
pension management. Consistent with their view that working capital management is a high-
value but low-satisfaction activity, it was identified as the finance function second most in need
of additional resources.2
CFOs Value Working Capital Management
Next, we use net working capital to consider the basic relationship between
current assets and current liabilities and then use the cash conversion cycle to
consider the key aspects of current asset management. In the following chapter,
we consider current liability management.

NET WORKING CAPITAL
Current assets, commonly called working capital, represent the portion of invest-
ment that circulates from one form to another in the ordinary conduct of busi-
ness. This idea embraces the recurring transition from cash to inventories to
accounts receivable and back to cash. As cash substitutes, marketable securities
are considered part of working capital.
Current liabilities represent the firm’s short-term financing, because they
include all debts of the firm that come due (must be paid) in 1 year or less. These
debts usually include amounts owed to suppliers (accounts payable), employees
and governments (accruals), and banks (notes payable), among others. (You can
refer to Chapter 3 for a full discussion of balance sheet items.)
As noted in Chapter 11, net working capital is defined as the difference
between the firm’s current assets and its current liabilities. When current assets
exceed current liabilities, the firm has positive net working capital. When cur-
rent assets are less than current liabilities, the firm has negative net working
capital.
The conversion of current assets from inventory to accounts receivable to cash
provides the cash used to pay current liabilities. The cash outlays for current liabil-
ities are relatively predictable. When an obligation is incurred, the firm generally
knows when the corresponding payment will be due. What is difficult to predict are
the cash inflows—the conversion of the current assets to more liquid forms. The
more predictable its cash inflows, the less net working capital a firm needs. Because
most firms are unable to match cash inflows to cash outflows with certainty, they
usually need current assets that more than cover outflows for current liabilities. In
general, the greater the margin by which a firm’s current assets cover its current lia-
bilities, the better able it will be to pay its bills as they come due.
TRADE-OFF BETWEEN PROFITABILITY AND RISK
A trade-off exists between a firm’s profitability and its risk. Profitability, in this
context, is the relationship between revenues and costs generated by using the
firm’s assets—both current and fixed—in productive activities. A firm can
increase its profits by (1) increasing revenues or (2) decreasing costs. Risk, in the
context of working capital management, is the probability that a firm will be
unable to pay its bills as they come due. A firm that cannot pay its bills as they
come due is said to be insolvent. It is generally assumed that the greater the firm’s
net working capital, the lower its risk. In other words, the more net working cap-
ital, the more liquid the firm and therefore the lower its risk of becoming insol-
vent. Using these definitions of profitability and risk, we can demonstrate the
trade-off between them by considering changes in current assets and current lia-
bilities separately.
Changes in Current Assets
We can demonstrate how changing the level of the firm’s current assets affects its
profitability–risk trade-off by using the ratio of current assets to total assets. This
ratio indicates the percentage of total assets that is current. For purposes of illus-
tration, we will assume that the level of total assets remains unchanged. The
effects on both profitability and risk of an increase or decrease in this ratio are
summarized in the upper portion of Table 15.1 (on page 602). When the ratio

increases—that is, when current assets increase—profitability decreases. Why?
Because current assets are less profitable than fixed assets. Fixed assets are more
profitable because they add more value to the product than that provided by cur-
rent assets. Without fixed assets, the firm could not produce the product.
The risk effect, however, decreases as the ratio of current assets to total assets
increases. The increase in current assets increases net working capital, thereby
reducing the risk of insolvency. In addition, as you go down the asset side of the
balance sheet, the risk associated with the assets increases: Investment in cash and
marketable securities is less risky than investment in accounts receivable, inven-
tories, and fixed assets. Accounts receivable investment is less risky than invest-
ment in inventories and fixed assets. Investment in inventories is less risky than
investment in fixed assets. The nearer an asset is to cash, the less risky it is. The
opposite effects on profit and risk result from a decrease in the ratio of current
assets to total assets.
In an effort to manage the risk effect, firms have been steadily moving away
from riskier current asset components, such as inventory. Figure 15.1 shows
that over time current assets consistently account for about 60 percent of total
assets in U.S. manufacturing firms, but inventory levels are dropping dramatically.

The fact that current assets relative to total assets remains fairly constant while inven-
tory investment is shrinking indicates that U.S. manufacturing firms are substituting
less risky current assets for inventory, the riskiest current asset. Indeed, Figure 15.1
shows that cash levels are increasing relative to total assets.
Changes in Current Liabilities
We also can demonstrate how changing the level of the firm’s current liabilities
affects its profitability–risk trade-off by using the ratio of current liabilities to total
assets. This ratio indicates the percentage of total assets that has been financed
with current liabilities. Again, assuming that total assets remain unchanged, the
effects on both profitability and risk of an increase or decrease in the ratio are
summarized in the lower portion of Table 15.1. When the ratio increases, prof-
itability increases. Why? Because the firm uses more of the less-expensive current
liabilities financing and less long-term financing. Current liabilities are less expen-
sive because only notes payable, which represent about 20 percent of the typical
manufacturer’s current liabilities, have a cost. The other current liabilities are basi-
cally debts on which the firm pays no charge or interest. However, when the ratio
of current liabilities to total assets increases, the risk of insolvency also increases
because the increase in current liabilities in turn decreases net working capital. The
opposite effects on profit and risk result from a decrease in the ratio of current lia-
bilities to total assets.

15.2 Cash Conversion Cycle
Central to working capital management is an understanding of the firm’s cash
conversion cycle.3 The cash conversion cycle (CCC) measures the length of time
required for a company to convert cash invested in its operations to cash received
as a result of its operations. This cycle frames discussion of the management of
the firm’s current assets in this chapter and that of the management of current

liabilities in Chapter 16. Here, we begin by demonstrating the calculation and
application of the cash conversion cycle.
CALCULATING THE CASH CONVERSION CYCLE
A firm’s operating cycle (OC) is the time from the beginning of the production
process to collection of cash from the sale of the finished product. The operating
cycle encompasses two major short-term asset categories, inventory and accounts
receivable. It is measured in elapsed time by summing the average age of inven-
tory (AAI) and the average collection period (ACP):
(15.1)
However, the process of producing and selling a product also includes the
purchase of production inputs (raw materials) on account, which results in
accounts payable. Accounts payable reduce the number of days a firm’s resources
are tied up in the operating cycle. The time it takes to pay the accounts payable,
measured in days, is the average payment period (APP). The operating cycle less
the average payment period yields the cash conversion cycle. The formula for the
cash conversion cycle is
(15.2)
Substituting the relationship in Equation 15.1 into Equation 15.2, we can see
that the cash conversion cycle has three main components, as shown in Equation
15.3: (1) average age of the inventory, (2) average collection period, and 
(3) average payment period:
(15.3)
Clearly, if a firm changes any of these time periods, it changes the amount of
resources tied up in the day-to-day operation of the firm.
In 2007, International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) had annual revenues of
$98,786 million, cost of revenue of $57,057 million, and accounts payable of
$8,054 million. IBM had an average age of inventory (AAI) of 17.5 days, an
average collection period (ACP) of 44.8 days, and an average payment period
(APP) of 51.2 days (IBM’s purchases were $57,416 million). Thus the cash con-
version cycle for IBM was 11.1 days 
. Figure 15.2 presents
IBM’s cash conversion cycle as a time line.
The resources IBM had invested in this cash conversion cycle (assuming a
365-day year) were

Matter of fact
Increasing Speed
Lowers Working Capital
A
firm can lower its
working capital if it can
speed up its operating cycle.
For example, if a firm accepts
bank credit (like a Visa card),
it will receive cash sooner
after the sale is transacted
than if it has to wait until the
customer pays its accounts
receivable.

As of the end of 2009, IBM had lowered its average collection period to 24.9
days. This dramatic increase in working capital efficiency reduced IBM’s oper-
ating cycle nearly 20 days and caused IBM’s cash conversion cycle to plummet to
7.6 days. The negative cash conversion cycle implies that IBM does not have to
pay its suppliers until nearly 8 days after it has collected its receivables. Most
importantly, IBM’s aggressive working capital management allowed it to recover
billions in working capital.
FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OF THE CASH CONVERSION CYCLE
We can use the cash conversion cycle as a basis for discussing how the firm funds
its required investment in operating assets. We first differentiate between perma-
nent and seasonal funding needs and then describe aggressive and conservative
seasonal funding strategies.
Permanent versus Seasonal Funding Needs
If the firm’s sales are constant, then its investment in operating assets should also be
constant, and the firm will have only a permanent funding requirement. If the firm’s
sales are cyclic, then its investment in operating assets will vary over time with its
sales cycles, and the firm will have seasonal funding requirements in addition to the
permanent funding required for its minimum investment in operating assets.
Nicholson Company holds, on average, $50,000 in cash and marketable securi-
ties, $1,250,000 in inventory, and $750,000 in accounts receivable. Nicholson’s
business is very stable over time, so its operating assets can be viewed as perma-
nent. In addition, Nicholson’s accounts payable of $425,000 are stable over time.
Thus Nicholson has a permanent investment in operating assets of $1,625,000
. That amount would also
equal its permanent funding requirement.
($50,000 + $1,250,0000 + $750,000 - $425,000)

In contrast, Semper Pump Company, which produces bicycle pumps, has sea-
sonal funding needs. Semper has seasonal sales, with its peak sales being driven
by the summertime purchases of bicycle pumps. Semper holds, at minimum,
$25,000 in cash and marketable securities, $100,000 in inventory, and $60,000
in accounts receivable. At peak times, Semper’s inventory increases to $750,000,
and its accounts receivable increase to $400,000. To capture production effi-
ciencies, Semper produces pumps at a constant rate throughout the year. Thus
accounts payable remain at $50,000 throughout the year. Accordingly, Semper
has a permanent funding requirement for its minimum level of operating assets
of
and peak seasonal
funding requirements (in excess of its permanent need) of $990,000
. Semper’s total
funding requirements for operating assets vary from a minimum of $135,000
(permanent) to a seasonal peak of 
. Figure 15.3
depicts these needs over time.
Aggressive versus Conservative Seasonal Funding Strategies
Short-term funds are typically less expensive than long-term funds. (The yield
curve is typically upward sloping.) However, long-term funds allow the firm to
lock in its cost of funds over a period of time and thus avoid the risk of increases
in short-term interest rates. Also, long-term funding ensures that the required
funds are available to the firm when needed. Short-term funding exposes the firm
to the risk that it may not be able to obtain the funds needed to cover its seasonal
peaks. Under an aggressive funding strategy, the firm funds its seasonal require-
ments with short-term debt and its permanent requirements with long-term debt.
Under a conservative funding strategy, the firm funds both its seasonal and its
permanent requirements with long-term debt.

strategy
A funding strategy under which
the firm funds both its seasonal

Semper Pump Company has a permanent funding requirement of $135,000 in
operating assets and seasonal funding requirements that vary between $0 and
$990,000 and average $101,250 (calculated from data not shown). If Semper can
borrow short-term funds at 6.25% and long-term funds at 8%, and if it can earn
5% on the investment of any surplus balances, then the annual cost of an aggres-
sive strategy for seasonal funding will be
Total cost of aggressive strategy
Because under this strategy the amount of financing exactly equals the estimated
funding need, no surplus balances exist.
Alternatively, Semper can choose a conservative strategy, under which sur-
plus cash balances are fully invested. (In Figure 15.3, this surplus will be the dif-
ference between the peak need of $1,125,000 and the total need, which varies
between $135,000 and $1,125,000 during the year.) The cost of the conservative
strategy will be
Total cost of conservative strategy
The average surplus balance would be calculated by subtracting the sum of the per-
manent need ($135,000) and the average seasonal need ($101,250) from the seasonal
peak need ($1,125,000) to get $888,750 
.
This represents the surplus amount of financing that on average could be invested
in short-term assets that earn a 5% annual return.
It is clear from these calculations that for Semper, the aggressive strategy is far
less expensive than the conservative strategy. However, it is equally clear that
Semper has substantial peak-season operating-asset needs and that it must have
adequate funding available to meet the peak needs and ensure ongoing operations.
Clearly, the aggressive strategy’s heavy reliance on short-term financing
makes it riskier than the conservative strategy because of interest rate swings and
possible difficulties in obtaining needed short-term financing quickly when sea-
sonal peaks occur. The conservative strategy avoids these risks through the
locked-in interest rate and long-term financing, but it is more costly because of
the negative spread between the earnings rate on surplus funds (5 percent in the
example) and the cost of the long-term funds that create the surplus (8 percent in
the example). Where the firm operates, between the extremes of the aggressive
and conservative seasonal funding strategies, depends on management’s disposi-
tion toward risk and the strength of its banking relationships.
STRATEGIES FOR MANAGING THE CASH CONVERSION CYCLE
Some firms establish a target cash conversion cycle and then monitor and manage
the actual cash conversion cycle toward the targeted value. A positive cash con-
version cycle, as was the case for IBM in 2008, means the firm must use negotiated

liabilities (such as bank loans) to support its operating assets. Negotiated liabili-
ties carry an explicit cost, so the firm benefits by minimizing their use in sup-
porting operating assets. Simply stated, the goal is to minimize the length of the
cash conversion cycle, which minimizes negotiated liabilities. This goal can be
realized through use of the following strategies:
1. Turn over inventory as quickly as possible without stockouts that result in
lost sales.
2. Collect accounts receivable as quickly as possible without losing sales from
high-pressure collection techniques.
3. Manage mail, processing, and clearing time to reduce them when collecting
from customers and to increase them when paying suppliers.
4. Pay accounts payable as slowly as possible without damaging the firm’s
credit rating.
Techniques for implementing these four strategies are the focus of the remainder
of this chapter and the following chapter.

PART 7
Short-Term Financial Decisions
15.3 Inventory Management
The first component of the cash conversion cycle is the average age of inventory.
The objective for managing inventory, as noted earlier, is to turn over inventory
as quickly as possible without losing sales from stockouts. The financial manager
tends to act as an advisor or “watchdog” in matters concerning inventory. He or
she does not have direct control over inventory but does provide input to the
inventory management process.
DIFFERING VIEWPOINTS ABOUT INVENTORY LEVEL
Differing viewpoints about appropriate inventory levels commonly exist among a
firm’s finance, marketing, manufacturing, and purchasing managers. Each views
inventory levels in light of his or her own objectives. The financial manager’s gen-
eral disposition toward inventory levels is to keep them low, to ensure that the
firm’s money is not being unwisely invested in excess resources. The marketing
manager, on the other hand, would like to have large inventories of the firm’s fin-
ished products. This would ensure that all orders could be filled quickly, elimi-
nating the need for backorders due to stockouts.
LG 3

The manufacturing manager’s major responsibility is to implement the produc-
tion plan so that it results in the desired amount of finished goods of acceptable
quality available on time at a low cost. In fulfilling this role, the manufacturing
manager would keep raw materials inventories high to avoid production delays. He
or she also would favor large production runs for the sake of lower unit production
costs, which would result in high finished goods inventories.
The purchasing manager is concerned solely with the raw materials invento-
ries. He or she must have on hand, in the correct quantities at the desired times
and at a favorable price, whatever raw materials are required by production.
Without proper control, in an effort to get quantity discounts or in anticipation
of rising prices or a shortage of certain materials, the purchasing manager may
purchase larger quantities of resources than are actually needed at the time.
COMMON TECHNIQUES FOR MANAGING INVENTORY
Numerous techniques are available for effectively managing the firm’s inventory.
Here we briefly consider four commonly used techniques.
ABC System
A firm using the ABC inventory system divides its inventory into three groups: A,
B, and C. The A group includes those items with the largest dollar investment.
Typically, this group consists of 20 percent of the firm’s inventory items but 80
percent of its investment in inventory. The B group consists of items that account
for the next largest investment in inventory. The C group consists of a large
number of items that require a relatively small investment.
The inventory group of each item determines the item’s level of monitoring.
The A group items receive the most intense monitoring because of the high dollar
investment. Typically, A group items are tracked on a perpetual inventory system
that allows daily verification of each item’s inventory level. B group items are
frequently controlled through periodic, perhaps weekly, checking of their levels.
C group items are monitored with unsophisticated techniques, such as the two-
bin method. With the two-bin method, the item is stored in two bins. As an item
is needed, inventory is removed from the first bin. When that bin is empty, an
order is placed to refill the first bin while inventory is drawn from the second
bin. The second bin is used until empty, and so on.
The large dollar investment in A and B group items suggests the need for a
better method of inventory management than the ABC system. The EOQ
model, discussed next, is an appropriate model for the management of A and B
group items.
Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) Model
One of the most common techniques for determining the optimal order size for
inventory items is the economic order quantity (EOQ) model. The EOQ model
considers various costs of inventory and then determines what order size mini-
mizes total inventory cost.
EOQ assumes that the relevant costs of inventory can be divided into order
costs and carrying costs. (The model excludes the actual cost of the inventory item.)
Each of them has certain key components and characteristics. Order costs include
the fixed clerical costs of placing and receiving orders: the cost of writing a purchase

order, of processing the resulting paperwork, and of receiving an order and
checking it against the invoice. Order costs are stated in dollars per order.
Carrying costs are the variable costs per unit of holding an item of inventory for a
specific period of time. Carrying costs include storage costs, insurance costs, the costs
of deterioration and obsolescence, and the opportunity or financial cost of having
funds invested in inventory. These costs are stated in dollars per unit per period.
Order costs decrease as the size of the order increases. Carrying costs, how-
ever, increase with increases in the order size. The EOQ model analyzes the trade-
off between order costs and carrying costs to determine the order quantity that
minimizes the total inventory cost.
Mathematical Development of EOQ
A formula can be developed for deter-
mining the firm’s EOQ for a given inventory item, where
The first step is to derive the cost functions for order cost and carrying cost. The
order cost can be expressed as the product of the cost per order and the number
of orders. Because the number of orders equals the usage during the period
divided by the order quantity (S/Q), the order cost can be expressed as follows:
(15.4)
The carrying cost is defined as the cost of carrying a unit of inventory per period
multiplied by the firm’s average inventory. The average inventory is the order
quantity divided by 2 (Q/2), because inventory is assumed to be depleted at a
constant rate. Thus carrying cost can be expressed as follows:
(15.5)
The firm’s total cost of inventory is found by summing the order cost and the
carrying cost. Thus the total cost function is
(15.6)
Because the EOQ is defined as the order quantity that minimizes the total cost func-
tion, we must solve the total cost function for the EOQ.4 The resulting equation is
(15.7)
EOQ = B
2 * S * O
C
Total cost = [O * (S , Q)] + [C * (Q , 2)]
Carrying cost = C * (Q , 2)
Order cost = O * (S , Q)
Q = order quantity in units
C = carrying cost per unit per period
O = order cost per order
S = usage in units per period

carrying costs

total cost of inventory
The sum of order costs and
carrying costs of inventory.
4. In this simple model the EOQ occurs at the point where the order cost 
just equals the carrying
cost 
. To demonstrate, we set the two costs equal and solve for Q:
Then cross-multiplying, we get:
Dividing both sides by C, we get:
Q2 = (2 * O * S) , C, so Q = 2(2 * O * S) , C
2 * O * S = C * Q2
[O * (S , Q)] = [C * (Q , 2)]
[C * (Q , 2)]
[O * (S , Q)]

Although the EOQ model has weaknesses, it is certainly better than subjec-
tive decision making. Despite the fact that the use of the EOQ model is outside
the control of the financial manager, the financial manager must be aware of its
utility and must provide certain inputs, specifically with respect to inventory car-
rying costs.
Individuals sometimes are confronted with personal finance
decisions involving cost trade-offs similar to the trade-off
between the fixed order costs and variable carrying costs of inventory that corpo-
rations face. Take the case of the von Dammes, who are trying to decide whether
a conventional car (uses gas) or a hybrid car (uses gas and electric battery) would
be more cost effective.
The von Dammes plan to keep whichever car they choose for 3 years and
expect to drive it 12,000 miles in each of those years. They will use the same
dollar amount of financing repaid under the same terms for either car, and they
expect the cars to have identical repair costs over the 3-year ownership period.
They also assume that the trade-in value of the two cars at the end of 3 years will
be identical. Both cars use regular unleaded gas, which they estimate will cost, on
average, $3.20 per gallon over the 3 years. The key data for each car follows:

We can begin by calculating the total fuel cost for each car over the 3-year
ownership period:
Conventional:
Hybrid:
To buy the hybrid car, the von Dammes will have to pay $2,800 more
than the cost of the conventional car, but they will save
about 
in fuel costs over the 3-year ownership period.
Ignoring differences in timing, on a strict economic basis they should buy the con-
ventional car because the $2,800 marginal cost of the hybrid results in a marginal
fuel cost savings of only $1,524. Clearly, other factors such as environmental
concerns and the reasonableness of the assumptions could affect their decision.
Reorder Point
Once the firm has determined its economic order quantity, it
must determine when to place an order. The reorder point reflects the number of
days of lead time the firm needs to place and receive an order and the firm’s daily

usage of the inventory item. Assuming that inventory is used at a constant rate,
the formula for the reorder point is
(15.8)
For example, if a firm knows it takes 3 days to place and receive an order, and if
it uses 15 units per day of the inventory item, then the reorder point is 45 units of
inventory (3 days
15 units/day). Thus, as soon as the item’s inventory level
falls to the reorder point (45 units, in this case) an order will be placed at the
item’s EOQ. If the estimates of lead time and usage are correct, then the order
will arrive exactly as the inventory level reaches zero. However, lead times and
usage rates are not precise, so most firms hold safety stock (extra inventory) to
prevent stockouts of important items.
MAX Company, a producer of dinnerware, has an A group inventory item that is
vital to the production process. This item costs $1,500, and MAX uses 1,100
units of the item per year. MAX wants to determine its optimal order strategy for
the item. To calculate the EOQ, we need the following inputs:
Substituting into Equation 15.7, we get
The reorder point for MAX depends on the number of days MAX operates
per year. Assuming that MAX operates 250 days per year and uses 1,100 units of
this item, its daily usage is 4.4 units (1,100
250). If its lead time is 2 days and
MAX wants to maintain a safety stock of 4 units, the reorder point for this item
is 12.8 units 
. However, orders are made only in whole units, so
the order is placed when the inventory falls to 13 units.
The firm’s goal for inventory is to turn it over as quickly as possible without
stockouts. Inventory turnover is best calculated by dividing cost of goods sold by
average inventory. The EOQ model determines the optimal order size and, indi-
rectly, through the assumption of constant usage, the average inventory. Thus the
EOQ model determines the firm’s optimal inventory turnover rate, given the
firm’s specific costs of inventory.
Just-in-Time (JIT) System
The just-in-time (JIT) system is used to minimize inventory investment. The phi-
losophy is that materials should arrive at exactly the time they are needed for pro-
duction. Ideally, the firm would have only work-in-process inventory. Because its
objective is to minimize inventory investment, a JIT system uses no (or very little)
safety stock. Extensive coordination among the firm’s employees, its suppliers,
and shipping companies must exist to ensure that material inputs arrive on time.
Failure of materials to arrive on time results in a shutdown of the production line
until the materials arrive. Likewise, a JIT system requires high-quality parts from

suppliers. When quality problems arise, production must be stopped until the
problems are resolved.
The goal of the JIT system is manufacturing efficiency. It uses inventory as a
tool for attaining efficiency by emphasizing quality of the materials used and
their timely delivery. When JIT is working properly, it forces process inefficiencies
to surface.
Knowing the level of inventory is, of course, an important part of any inventory
management system. As described in the Focus on Practice box, radio frequency
identification technology may be the “next new thing” in improving inventory and
supply chain management.
Computerized Systems for Resource Control
Today a number of systems are available for controlling inventory and other
resources. One of the most basic is the materials requirement planning (MRP)
system. It is used to determine what materials to order and when to order them.
MRP applies EOQ concepts to determine how much to order. Using a computer,

RFID: The Wave of the Future
Wal-Mart expects the RFID technol-
ogy to improve its inventory manage-
ment, and it remains committed to
advancing its use of RFID. During the
2010 National Retail Federation’s Big
Show convention, Wal-Mart’s CIO,
Rollin Ford, said, “We’re still bullish on
RFID.” He also indicated that Wal-Mart
ran some apparel pilots last year that
showed good results and that the
retailer plans to “eat what we cook.”
Wal-Mart manufactures some apparel
items and controls its own supply
chain, and Ford indicated that Wal-
Mart plans to use RFID technology in its
apparel supply chain. Wal-Mart will
then share the benefits and best prac-
tices with its suppliers, which might
want to achieve the same benefits from
the technology.

RFID-enabled. Although Wal-Mart’s ulti-
mate goal is to have all of its
100,000-plus suppliers on board using
electronic product codes (EPC) with
RFID technology, progress has slowed
as Wal-Mart’s suppliers remain uncon-
vinced of RFID’s cost savings.
The major issue with RFID tags is
per-chip cost. In 2004, when Wal-Mart
announced its intent to use RFID tags,
they sold for 30 to 50 cents each.
Wal-Mart requested a price of 5 cents
per tag, expecting increased demand
and economies of scale to push the
price down to make them more com-
petitive with inexpensive barcodes.
Increased demand has brought the
price of current-generation RFID tags to
about 15 cents apiece, but barcodes
cost only a fraction of a cent. Barcodes
help track inventory and can match a
product to a price, but they lack the
electronic tags’ ability to store more
detailed information, such as the serial
number of a product, the location of
the factory that made it, when it was
made, and when it was sold.
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,
the world’s number one
retailer, operates more than 8,400 retail
units under 55 different banners in 15
countries and employs more than two
million people around the world. What’s
more, Wal-Mart came in first place
among retailers in Fortune magazine’s
2010 Most Admired Companies survey.
With fiscal 2010 sales of $405 billion,
Wal-Mart is able to exert tremendous
pressure on its suppliers. When Wal-
Mart announced in April 2004 that it
was beginning a pilot program to test
radio frequency identification (RFID)
technology to improve its inventory and
supply chain management, suppliers
and competitors took notice.
One of the first companies to intro-
duce bar codes in the early 1980s,
Wal-Mart required its top 100 suppli-
ers to put RFID tags on shipping crates

MRP simulates each product’s bill of materials, inventory status, and manufac-
turing process. The bill of materials is simply a list of all parts and materials that
go into making the finished product. For a given production plan, the computer
simulates material requirements by comparing production needs to available
inventory balances. On the basis of the time it takes for a product that is in
process to move through the various production stages and the lead time to get
materials, the MRP system determines when orders should be placed for various
items on the bill of materials. The objective of this system is to lower the firm’s
inventory investment without impairing production. If the firm’s pretax opportu-
nity cost of capital for investments of equal risk is 20 percent, every dollar of
investment released from inventory will increase before-tax profits by $0.20.
A popular extension of MRP is manufacturing resource planning II (MRP II),
which integrates data from numerous areas such as finance, accounting, mar-
keting, engineering, and manufacturing using a sophisticated computer system.
This system generates production plans as well as numerous financial and man-
agement reports. In essence, it models the firm’s processes so that the effects of
changes in one area of operations on other areas can be assessed and monitored.
For example, the MRP II system would allow the firm to assess the effect of an
increase in labor costs on sales and profits.
Whereas MRP and MRP II tend to focus on internal operations, enterprise
resource planning (ERP) systems expand the focus to the external environment
by including information about suppliers and customers. ERP electronically inte-
grates all of a firm’s departments so that, for example, production can call up
sales information and immediately know how much must be produced to fill cus-
tomer orders. Because all available resources—human and material—are known,
the system can eliminate production delays and control costs. ERP systems auto-
matically note changes, such as a supplier’s inability to meet a scheduled delivery
date, so that necessary adjustments can be made.
INTERNATIONAL INVENTORY MANAGEMENT
International inventory management is typically much more complicated for
exporters in general, and for multinational companies in particular, than for
purely domestic firms. The production and manufacturing economies of scale
that might be expected from selling products globally may prove elusive if prod-
ucts must be tailored for individual local markets, as frequently happens, or if
actual production takes place in factories around the world. When raw materials,
intermediate goods, or finished products must be transported over long distances—
particularly by ocean shipping—there will be more delays, confusion, damage,
and theft than occur in a one-country operation. The international inventory
manager, therefore, puts a premium on flexibility. He or she is usually less con-
cerned about ordering the economically optimal quantity of inventory than about
making sure that sufficient quantities of inventory are delivered where they are
needed, when they are needed, and in a condition to be used as planned.

15.4 Accounts Receivable Management
The second component of the cash conversion cycle is the average collection
period. This period is the average length of time from a sale on credit until the
payment becomes usable funds for the firm. The average collection period has
two parts. The first part is the time from the sale until the customer mails the pay-
ment. The second part is the time from when the payment is mailed until the firm
has the collected funds in its bank account. The first part of the average collection
period involves managing the credit available to the firm’s customers, and the
second part involves collecting and processing payments. This section of the
chapter discusses the firm’s accounts receivable credit management.
The objective for managing accounts receivable is to collect accounts receiv-
able as quickly as possible without losing sales from high-pressure collection
techniques. Accomplishing this goal encompasses three topics: (1) credit selection
and standards, (2) credit terms, and (3) credit monitoring.
CREDIT SELECTION AND STANDARDS
Credit selection involves application of techniques for determining which cus-
tomers should receive credit. This process involves evaluating the customer’s
creditworthiness and comparing it to the firm’s credit standards, its minimum
requirements for extending credit to a customer.
Five C’s of Credit
One popular credit selection technique is the five C’s of credit, which provides a
framework for in-depth credit analysis. Because of the time and expense involved,
this credit selection method is used for large-dollar credit requests. The five C’s are
1. Character: The applicant’s record of meeting past obligations.
2. Capacity: The applicant’s ability to repay the requested credit, as judged in
terms of financial statement analysis focused on cash flows available to repay
debt obligations.
3. Capital: The applicant’s debt relative to equity.
4. Collateral: The amount of assets the applicant has available for use in securing
the credit. The larger the amount of available assets, the greater the chance
that a firm will recover funds if the applicant defaults.
5. Conditions: Current general and industry-specific economic conditions, and
any unique conditions surrounding a specific transaction.
Analysis via the five C’s of credit does not yield a specific accept/reject deci-
sion, so its use requires an analyst experienced in reviewing and granting credit
requests. Application of this framework tends to ensure that the firm’s credit cus-
tomers will pay, without being pressured, within the stated credit terms.

Credit Scoring
Credit scoring is a method of credit selection that firms commonly use with high-
volume/small-dollar credit requests. Credit scoring applies statistically derived
weights to a credit applicant’s scores on key financial and credit characteristics to pre-
dict whether he or she will pay the requested credit in a timely fashion. Simply stated,
the procedure results in a score that measures the applicant’s overall credit strength,
and the score is used to make the accept/reject decision for granting the applicant
credit. Credit scoring is most commonly used by large credit card operations, such as
those of banks, oil companies, and department stores. The purpose of credit scoring
is to make a relatively informed credit decision quickly and inexpensively, recognizing
that the cost of a single bad scoring decision is small. However, if bad debts from
scoring decisions increase, then the scoring system must be reevaluated.
Changing Credit Standards
The firm sometimes will contemplate changing its credit standards in an effort to
improve its returns and create greater value for its owners. To demonstrate, con-
sider the following changes and effects on profits expected to result from the
relaxation of credit standards.

Dodd Tool, a manufacturer of lathe tools, is currently selling a product for $10
per unit. Sales (all on credit) for last year were 60,000 units. The variable cost per
unit is $6. The firm’s total fixed costs are $120,000.
The firm is currently contemplating a relaxation of credit standards that is
expected to result in the following: a 5% increase in unit sales to 63,000 units; 
an increase in the average collection period from 30 days (the current level) to
45 days; an increase in bad-debt expenses from 1% of sales (the current level)
to 2%. The firm determines that its cost of tying up funds in receivables is 15%
before taxes.
To determine whether to relax its credit standards, Dodd Tool must calculate
its effect on the firm’s additional profit contribution from sales, the cost of the
marginal investment in accounts receivable, and the cost of marginal bad debts.
Additional Profit Contribution from Sales
Because fixed costs are “sunk” and
therefore are unaffected by a change in the sales level, the only cost relevant to a
change in sales is variable costs. Sales are expected to increase by 5%, or 3,000
units. The profit contribution per unit will equal the difference between the sale
price per unit ($10) and the variable cost per unit ($6). The profit contribution
per unit therefore will be $4. The total additional profit contribution from sales
will be $12,000 (3,000 units
$4 per unit).

Example 15.6 3

Cost of the Marginal Investment in Accounts Receivable
To determine the cost
of the marginal investment in accounts receivable, Dodd must find the difference
between the cost of carrying receivables under the two credit standards. Because
its concern is only with the out-of-pocket costs, the relevant cost is the variable
cost. The average investment in accounts receivable can be calculated by using
the following formula:
(15.9)
where
The total variable cost of annual sales under the present and proposed plans can
be found as follows, using the variable cost per unit of $6.

The turnover of accounts receivable is the number of times each year that the
firm’s accounts receivable are actually turned into cash. It is found by dividing the
average collection period into 365 (the number of days assumed in a year).

The resulting value of $2,574 is considered a cost because it represents the max-
imum amount that could have been earned before taxes on the $17,159 had it
been placed in an equally risky investment earning 15% before taxes.
Cost of Marginal Bad Debts
We find the cost of marginal bad debts by taking
the difference between the levels of bad debts before and after the proposed relax-
ation of credit standards.
Cost of marginal bad debts
Under proposed plan: 
$12,600
Under present plan: 
Cost of marginal bad debts
Note that the bad-debt costs are calculated by using the sale price per unit
($10) to deduct not just the true loss of variable cost ($6) that results when a cus-
tomer fails to pay its account but also the profit contribution per unit (in this case
$4) that is included in the “additional profit contribution from sales.” Thus the
resulting cost of marginal bad debts is $6,600.
Making the Credit Standard Decision
To decide whether to relax its credit
standards, the firm must compare the additional profit contribution from sales to
the added costs of the marginal investment in accounts receivable and marginal
bad debts. If the additional profit contribution is greater than marginal costs,
credit standards should be relaxed.
The results and key calculations related to Dodd Tool’s decision whether to relax
its credit standards are summarized in Table 15.2. The net addition to total
profits resulting from such an action will be $2,826 per year. Therefore, the firm
should relax its credit standards as proposed.
The procedure described here for evaluating a proposed change in credit
standards is also commonly used to evaluate other changes in the management of
accounts receivable. If Dodd Tool had been contemplating tightening its credit
standards, for example, the cost would have been a reduction in the profit contri-
bution from sales, and the return would have been from reductions in the cost of
the investment in accounts receivable and in the cost of bad debts. Another appli-
cation of this procedure is demonstrated later in the chapter.
Managing International Credit
Credit management is difficult enough for managers of purely domestic compa-
nies, and these tasks become much more complex for companies that operate
internationally. This is partly because (as we have seen before) international oper-
ations typically expose a firm to exchange rate risk. It is also due to the dangers
and delays involved in shipping goods long distances and in having to cross
international borders.
Exports of finished goods are usually priced in the currency of the importer’s
local market; most commodities, on the other hand, are priced in dollars.
Therefore, a U.S. company that sells a product in Japan, for example, would have

PART 7
Short-Term Financial Decisions

to price that product in Japanese yen and extend credit to a Japanese wholesaler
in the local currency (yen). If the yen depreciates against the dollar before the U.S.
exporter collects on its account receivable, the U.S. company experiences an
exchange rate loss; the yen collected are worth fewer dollars than expected at the
time the sale was made. Of course, the dollar could just as easily depreciate
against the yen, yielding an exchange rate gain to the U.S. exporter. Most compa-
nies fear the loss more than they welcome the gain.
For a major currency such as the Japanese yen, the exporter can hedge
against this risk by using the currency futures, forward, or options markets, but it
is costly to do so, particularly for relatively small amounts. If the exporter is
selling to a customer in a developing country—where 40 percent of U.S. exports
are now sold—there will probably be no effective instrument available for pro-
tecting against exchange rate risk at any price. This risk may be further magnified
because credit standards may be much lower (and acceptable collection techniques
much different) in developing countries than in the United States. Although it may
seem tempting to just “not bother” with exporting, U.S. companies no longer can
concede foreign markets to international rivals. These export sales, if carefully
monitored and (where possible) effectively hedged against exchange rate risk,
often prove to be very profitable.
CREDIT TERMS
Credit terms are the terms of sale for customers who have been extended credit
by the firm. Terms of net 30 mean the customer has 30 days from the beginning
of the credit period (typically end of month or date of invoice) to pay the full

invoice amount. Some firms offer cash discounts, percentage deductions from the
purchase price for paying within a specified time. For example, terms of 2/10 net
30 mean the customer can take a 2 percent discount from the invoice amount if
the payment is made within 10 days of the beginning of the credit period or can
pay the full amount of the invoice within 30 days.
A firm’s business strongly influences its regular credit terms. For example, a
firm selling perishable items will have very short credit terms because its items
have little long-term collateral value; a firm in a seasonal business may tailor its
terms to fit the industry cycles. A firm wants its regular credit terms to conform
to its industry’s standards. If its terms are more restrictive than its competitors’, it
will lose business; if its terms are less restrictive than its competitors’, it will
attract poor-quality customers that probably could not pay under the standard
industry terms. The bottom line is that a firm should compete on the basis of
quality and price of its product and service offerings, not its credit terms.
Accordingly, the firm’s regular credit terms should match the industry standards,
but individual customer terms should reflect the riskiness of the customer.
Cash Discount
Including a cash discount in the credit terms is a popular way to speed up collec-
tions without putting pressure on customers. The cash discount provides an
incentive for customers to pay sooner. By speeding collections, the discount
decreases the firm’s investment in accounts receivable, but it also decreases the
per-unit profit. Additionally, initiating a cash discount should reduce bad debts
because customers will pay sooner, and it should increase sales volume because
customers who take the discount pay a lower price for the product. Accordingly,
firms that consider offering a cash discount must perform a benefit–cost analysis
to determine whether extending a cash discount is profitable.
MAX Company has annual sales of $10 million and an average collection period
of 40 days (turnover
). In accordance with the firm’s credit
terms of net 30, this period is divided into 32 days until the customers place their
payments in the mail (not everyone pays within 30 days) and 8 days to receive,
process, and collect payments once they are mailed. MAX is considering initi-
ating a cash discount by changing its credit terms from net 30 to 2/10 net 30.
The firm expects this change to reduce the amount of time until the payments
are placed in the mail, resulting in an average collection period of 25 days
(turnover
).
As noted earlier in Example 15.5, MAX has a raw material with current annual
usage of 1,100 units. Each finished product produced requires one unit of this raw
material at a variable cost of $1,500 per unit, incurs another $800 of variable cost in
the production process, and sells for $3,000 on terms of net 30. Variable costs there-
fore total $2,300 ($1,500
$800). MAX estimates that 80% of its customers will
take the 2% discount and that offering the discount will increase sales of the finished
product by 50 units (from 1,100 to 1,150 units) per year but will not alter its bad-
debt percentage. MAX’s opportunity cost of funds invested in accounts receivable is
14%. Should MAX offer the proposed cash discount? An analysis similar to that
demonstrated earlier for the credit standard decision, presented in Table 15.3, shows
a net loss from the cash discount of $6,640. Thus MAX should not initiate the pro-
posed cash discount. However, other discounts may be advantageous.

TABLE 15.3
Cash Discount Period
The financial manager can change the cash discount period, the number of days
after the beginning of the credit period during which the cash discount is avail-
able. The net effect of changes in this period is difficult to analyze because of the
nature of the forces involved. For example, if a firm were to increase its cash dis-
count period by 10 days (for example, changing its credit terms from 2/10 net 30
to 2/20 net 30), the following changes would be expected to occur: (1) Sales
would increase, positively affecting profit. (2) Bad-debt expenses would decrease,
positively affecting profit. (3) The profit per unit would decrease as a result of
more people taking the discount, negatively affecting profit.
The difficulty for the financial manager lies in assessing what impact an
increase in the cash discount period would have on the firm’s investment in
accounts receivable. This investment will decrease because of non–discount
takers now paying earlier. However, the investment in accounts receivable will
increase for two reasons: (1) Discount takers will still get the discount but will
pay later, and (2) new customers attracted by the new policy will result in new
accounts receivable. If the firm were to decrease the cash discount period, the
effects would be the opposite of those just described.
Credit Period
Changes in the credit period, the number of days after the beginning of the credit
period until full payment of the account is due, also affect a firm’s profitability.
For example, increasing a firm’s credit period from net 30 days to net 45 days
should increase sales, positively affecting profit. But both the investment in
accounts receivable and bad-debt expenses would also increase, negatively

affecting profit. The increased investment in accounts receivable would result
from both more sales and generally slower pay, on average, as a result of the
longer credit period. The increase in bad-debt expenses results from the fact that
the longer the credit period, the more time available for a firm to fail, making it
unable to pay its accounts payable. A decrease in the length of the credit period is
likely to have the opposite effects. Note that the variables affected by an increase
in the credit period behave in the same way they would have if the credit stan-
dards had been relaxed, as demonstrated earlier in Table 15.2.
CREDIT MONITORING
The final issue a firm should consider in its accounts receivable management is
credit monitoring. Credit monitoring is an ongoing review of the firm’s accounts
receivable to determine whether customers are paying according to the stated
credit terms. If they are not paying in a timely manner, credit monitoring will
alert the firm to the problem. Slow payments are costly to a firm because they
lengthen the average collection period and thus increase the firm’s investment in
accounts receivable. Two frequently used techniques for credit monitoring are
average collection period and aging of accounts receivable. In addition, a number
of popular collection techniques are used by firms.
Average Collection Period
The average collection period is the second component of the cash conversion
cycle. As noted in Chapter 3, it is the average number of days that credit sales are
outstanding. The average collection period has two components: (1) the time
from sale until the customer places the payment in the mail and (2) the time to
receive, process, and collect the payment once it has been mailed by the customer.
The formula for finding the average collection period is
(15.10)
Assuming receipt, processing, and collection time is constant, the average collec-
tion period tells the firm, on average, when its customers pay their accounts.
Knowing its average collection period enables the firm to determine whether
there is a general problem with accounts receivable. For example, a firm that has
credit terms of net 30 would expect its average collection period (minus receipt,
processing, and collection time) to equal about 30 days. If the actual collection
period is significantly greater than 30 days, the firm has reason to review its
credit operations. If the firm’s average collection period is increasing over time, it
has cause for concern about its accounts receivable management. A first step in
analyzing an accounts receivable problem is to “age” the accounts receivable. By
this process the firm can determine whether the problem exists in its accounts
receivable in general or is attributable to a few specific accounts.
Aging of Accounts Receivable
An aging schedule breaks down accounts receivable into groups on the basis of their
time of origin. The breakdown is typically made on a month-by-month basis, going
back 3 or 4 months. The resulting schedule indicates the percentages of the total

accounts receivable balance that have been outstanding for specified periods of time.
The purpose of the aging schedule is to enable the firm to pinpoint problems. A
simple example will illustrate the form and evaluation of an aging schedule.
The accounts receivable balance on the books of Dodd Tool on December 31,
2012, was $200,000. The firm extends net 30-day credit terms to its customers.
To gain insight into the firm’s relatively lengthy—51.3-day—average collection
period, Dodd prepared the following aging schedule.

Because Dodd extends 30-day credit terms to its customers, they have 30 days
after the end of the month of sale to remit payment. Therefore, the 40% of the bal-
ance outstanding with an age of 0–30 days is current. The balances outstanding
for 31–60 days, 61–90 days, 91–120 days, and over 120 days are overdue.
Reviewing the aging schedule, we see that 40% of the accounts are current
(age
30 days) and the remaining 60% are overdue (age
30 days). Eighteen
percent of the balance outstanding is 1–30 days overdue, 26% is 31–60 days
overdue, 13% is 61–90 days overdue, and 3% is more than 90 days overdue.
Although the collections seem generally slow, a noticeable irregularity in these
data is the high percentage of the balance outstanding that is 31–60 days overdue
(ages of 61–90 days). Clearly, a problem must have occurred 61–90 days ago.
Investigation may find that the problem can be attributed to the hiring of a new
credit manager, the acceptance of a new account that made a large credit pur-
chase but has not yet paid for it, or ineffective collection policy. When this type of
discrepancy is found in the aging schedule, the analyst should determine, eval-
uate, and remedy its cause.
Popular Collection Techniques
A number of collection techniques, ranging from letters to legal action, are
employed. As an account becomes more and more overdue, the collection effort
becomes more personal and more intense. In Table 15.4 the popular collection
techniques are listed, and briefly described, in the order typically followed in the
collection process.

Popular Collection Techniques
Techniquea
Brief description
Letters
After a certain number of days, the firm sends a polite letter reminding the customer of the overdue
account. If the account is not paid within a certain period after this letter has been sent, a second,
more demanding letter is sent.
Telephone calls
If letters prove unsuccessful, a telephone call may be made to the customer to request immediate
payment. If the customer has a reasonable excuse, arrangements may be made to extend the payment
period. A call from the seller’s attorney may be used.
Personal visits
This technique is much more common at the consumer credit level, but it may also be effectively
employed by industrial suppliers. Sending a local salesperson or a collection person to confront the
customer can be very effective. Payment may be made on the spot.
Collection agencies
A firm can turn uncollectible accounts over to a collection agency or an attorney for collection. The
fees for this service are typically quite high; the firm may receive less than 50 cents on the dollar from
accounts collected in this way.
Legal action
Legal action is the most stringent step, an alternative to the use of a collection agency. Not only is
direct legal action expensive, but it may force the debtor into bankruptcy without guaranteeing the
ultimate receipt of the overdue amount.
aThe techniques are listed in the order in which they are typically followed in the collection process.
TABLE 15.4
15.5 Management of Receipts and Disbursements
As discussed in the previous section, the average collection period (the second
component of the cash conversion cycle) has two parts: (1) the time from sale
until the customer mails the payment and (2) the receipt, processing, and collec-
tion time. The third component of the cash conversion cycle, the average pay-
ment period, also has two parts: (1) the time from purchase of goods on account
until the firm mails its payment and (2) the receipt, processing, and collection
time required by the firm’s suppliers. The receipt, processing, and collection time
for the firm, both from its customers and to its suppliers, is the focus of receipts
and disbursements management.
FLOAT
Float refers to funds that have been sent by the payer but are not yet usable funds
to the payee. Float is important in the cash conversion cycle because its presence
lengthens both the firm’s average collection period and its average payment
period. However, the goal of the firm should be to shorten its average collection

period and lengthen its average payment period. Both can be accomplished by
managing float.
Float has three component parts:
1. Mail float is the time delay between when payment is placed in the mail and
when it is received.
2. Processing float is the time between receipt of the payment and its deposit
into the firm’s account.
3. Clearing float is the time between deposit of the payment and when spend-
able funds become available to the firm. This component of float is attribut-
able to the time required for a check to clear the banking system.
Some popular techniques for managing the component parts of float to speed up
collections and slow down payments are described here.
SPEEDING UP COLLECTIONS
Speeding up collections reduces customer collection float time and thus reduces
the firm’s average collection period, which reduces the investment the firm must
make in its cash conversion cycle. In our earlier examples, MAX Company had
annual sales of $10 million and 8 days of total collection float (receipt, processing,
and collection time). If MAX can reduce its float time by 3 days, it will reduce its
investment in the cash conversion cycle by $82,192 
.
A popular technique for speeding up collections is a lockbox system. A
lockbox system works as follows: Instead of mailing payments to the company,
customers mail payments to a post office box. The firm’s bank empties the post
office box regularly, processes each payment, and deposits the payments in the
firm’s account. Deposit slips, along with payment enclosures, are sent (or trans-
mitted electronically) to the firm by the bank so that the firm can properly credit
customers’ accounts. Lockboxes are geographically dispersed to match the loca-
tions of the firm’s customers. A lockbox system affects all three components of
float. Lockboxes reduce mail time and often clearing time by being near the firm’s
customers. Lockboxes reduce processing time to nearly zero because the bank
deposits payments before the firm processes them. Obviously a lockbox system
reduces collection float time, but not without a cost; therefore, a firm must perform
an economic analysis to determine whether to implement a lockbox system.
Lockbox systems are commonly used by large firms whose customers are
geographically dispersed. However, a firm does not have to be large to benefit
from a lockbox. Smaller firms can also benefit from a lockbox system. The ben-
efit to small firms often comes primarily from transferring the processing of pay-
ments to the bank.
SLOWING DOWN PAYMENTS
Float is also a component of the firm’s average payment period. In this case, the
float is in the favor of the firm. The firm may benefit by increasing all three of the
components of its payment float. One popular technique for increasing payment
float is controlled disbursing, which involves the strategic use of mailing points
and bank accounts to lengthen mail float and clearing float, respectively. Firms
must use this approach carefully, though, because longer payment periods may
strain supplier relations.
The nearby Focus on Ethics box takes a closer look at the ethical issues
involved in slowing down payments through controlled disbursing and other

methods—a technique known collectively as stretching accounts payable. This is
a topic we will come back to in Chapter 16.
In summary, a reasonable overall policy for float management is (1) to collect
payments as quickly as possible because, once the payment is in the mail, the
funds belong to the firm; and (2) to delay making payment to suppliers because,
once the payment is mailed, the funds belong to the supplier.
CASH CONCENTRATION
Cash concentration is the process used by the firm to bring lockbox and other
deposits together into one bank, often called the concentration bank. Cash con-
centration has three main advantages. First, it creates a large pool of funds for use
in making short-term cash investments. Because there is a fixed-cost component
in the transaction cost associated with such investments, investing a single pool of
funds reduces the firm’s transaction costs. The larger investment pool also allows
the firm to choose from a greater variety of short-term investment vehicles.

PART 7
Short-Term Financial Decisions
focus on ETHICS
Stretching Accounts Payable—Is It a Good Policy?
Stretching payables
has often been consid-
ered good cash management. By
delaying bill payments as long as pos-
sible without damaging the firm’s credit,
companies get interest-free loans from
suppliers. Some businesses deliberately
increase their accounts payable lag to
cover temporary cash shortages.
There are two negative ramifica-
tions of stretching accounts payables
(A/P). First, the stretching out of
payables can be pushed too far, and a
business can get tagged as a slow
payer. Vendors will eventually put
increasing pressure on the company to
make more timely payments.
Stretching accounts payables also
raises ethical issues. First, it may cause
the firm to violate the agreement it
entered with its supplier when it pur-
chased the merchandise. More impor-
tant to investors, the firm may stretch
A/P to artificially boost reported oper-
ating cash flow during a reporting
period. In other words, firms can
improve reported operating cash flows
due solely to a decision to slow the
payment rate to vendors. Unfortunately
for investors, the improvement in operat-
ing cash flows may be unsustainable if
vendors force the company to improve
its payment record; at a minimum, any
year-over-year improvement in operat-
ing cash flow may be unsustainable.
The extension of payables can be
identified by monitoring days sales
payables (DSP), calculated as the end-
of-period accounts payable balance
divided by the cost of goods sold and
multiplied by the number of days in the
period. As DSP grows, operating cash
flows are boosted.
A more complicated version of
stretching payables is the financing of
payables. This occurs when a company
uses a third-party financial institution to
pay the vendor in the current period
and pays back the bank in a subse-
quent period. This approach reclassifies
the amount from accounts payable to
short-term loans. The reclassification
results in a decrease to operating cash
flow in that quarter and an increase in
financing cash flow. Normally, cash
expenditures for accounts payable are
included in operating activities.
Because the timing and extent of ven-
dor financing is at the discretion of
company management, the temptation
to manipulate operating cash flows
may prove too great for some.
Setting aside the ethical ramifica-
tions of stretching accounts payable,
there may be financial incentives for
avoiding the practice. Companies that
can move to an automated A/P system
may be able to take advantage of ben-
eficial early payment discounts that pro-
vide a far better risk-free rate of return
than stretching out accounts payable.
For example, a 2/10 net 30 discount
equates to about a 36 percent annual-
ized return. Viewed this way, an A/P
balance may be the most expensive
debt on the balance sheet.
3 While vendor discounts for early
payment are very rewarding, what
are some of the difficulties that may
arise to keep a firm from taking
advantage of those discounts?
in practice
cash concentration
The process used by the firm to
bring lockbox and other
deposits together into one
bank, often called the
concentration bank.

Second, concentrating the firm’s cash in one account improves the tracking and
internal control of the firm’s cash. Third, having one concentration bank enables
the firm to implement payment strategies that reduce idle cash balances.
There are a variety of mechanisms for transferring cash from the lockbox
bank and other collecting banks to the concentration bank. One mechanism is a
depository transfer check (DTC), which is an unsigned check drawn on one of
the firm’s bank accounts and deposited in another. For cash concentration, a
DTC is drawn on each lockbox or other collecting bank account and deposited in
the concentration bank account. Once the DTC has cleared the bank on which it
is drawn (which may take several days), the transfer of funds is completed. Most
firms currently provide deposit information by telephone to the concentration
bank, which then prepares and deposits into its account the DTC drawn on the
lockbox or other collecting bank account.
A second mechanism is an ACH (automated clearinghouse) transfer, which is
a preauthorized electronic withdrawal from the payer’s account. A computerized
clearing facility (called the automated clearinghouse, or ACH) makes a paperless
transfer of funds between the payer and payee banks. An ACH settles accounts
among participating banks. Individual accounts are settled by respective bank bal-
ance adjustments. ACH transfers clear in one day. For cash concentration, an
ACH transfer is made from each lockbox bank or other collecting bank to the
concentration bank. An ACH transfer can be thought of as an electronic DTC, but
because the ACH transfer clears in one day, it provides benefits over a DTC; how-
ever, both banks in the ACH transfer must be members of the clearinghouse.
A third cash concentration mechanism is a wire transfer. A wire transfer is an
electronic communication that, via bookkeeping entries, removes funds from the
payer’s bank and deposits them in the payee’s bank. Wire transfers can eliminate
mail and clearing float and may reduce processing float as well. For cash concen-
tration, the firm moves funds using a wire transfer from each lockbox or other
collecting account to its concentration account. Wire transfers are a substitute for
DTC and ACH transfers, but they are more expensive.
It is clear that the firm must balance the costs and benefits of concentrating
cash to determine the type and timing of transfers from its lockbox and other col-
lecting accounts to its concentration account. The transfer mechanism selected
should be the one that is most profitable. (The profit per period of any transfer
mechanism equals earnings on the increased availability of funds minus the cost
of the transfer system.)
ZERO-BALANCE ACCOUNTS
Zero-balance accounts (ZBAs) are disbursement accounts that always have an
end-of-day balance of zero. The purpose is to eliminate nonearning cash balances
in corporate checking accounts. A ZBA works well as a disbursement account
under a cash concentration system.
ZBAs work as follows: Once all of a given day’s checks are presented for pay-
ment from the firm’s ZBA, the bank notifies the firm of the total amount of checks,
and the firm transfers funds into the account to cover the amount of that day’s
checks. This leaves an end-of-day balance of $0 (zero dollars). The ZBA enables the
firm to keep all of its operating cash in an interest-earning account, thereby elimi-
nating idle cash balances. Thus a firm that used a ZBA in conjunction with a cash
concentration system would need two accounts. The firm would concentrate its

cash from the lockboxes and other collecting banks into an interest-earning
account and would write checks against its ZBA. The firm would cover the exact
dollar amount of checks presented against the ZBA with transfers from the interest-
earning account, leaving the end-of-day balance in the ZBA at $0.
A ZBA is a disbursement-management tool. As we discussed earlier, the firm
would prefer to maximize its payment float. However, some cash managers feel
that actively attempting to increase float time on payments is unethical. A ZBA
enables the firm to maximize the use of float on each check without altering the
float time of payments to its suppliers. Keeping all the firm’s cash in an interest-
earning account enables the firm to maximize earnings on its cash balances by
capturing the full float time on each check it writes.
Megan Laurie, a 25-year-old nurse, works at a hospital that
pays her every 2 weeks by direct deposit into her checking
account, which pays no interest and has no minimum balance requirement. She
takes home about $1,800 every 2 weeks—or about $3,600 per month. She main-
tains a checking account balance of around $1,500. Whenever it exceeds that
amount she transfers the excess into her savings account, which currently pays
1.5% annual interest. She currently has a savings account balance of $17,000
and estimates that she transfers about $600 per month from her checking
account into her savings account.
Megan pays her bills immediately when she receives them. Her monthly bills
average about $1,900, and her monthly cash outlays for food and gas total about
$900. An analysis of Megan’s bill payments indicates that on average she pays
her bills 8 days early. Most marketable securities are currently yielding about
4.2% annual interest. Megan is interested in learning how she might better
manage her cash balances.
Megan talks with her sister, who has had a finance course, and they come up
with three ways for Megan to better manage her cash balance:
1. Invest current balances. Megan can transfer her current savings account
balances into a liquid marketable security, thereby increasing the rate of
interest earned from 1.5% to about 4.2%. On her current $17,000 balance,
she will immediately increase her annual interest earnings by about $460
.
2. Invest monthly surpluses. Megan can transfer monthly the $600 from her
checking account to the liquid marketable security, thereby increasing the annual
earnings on each monthly transfer by about $16 
,
which for the 12 transfers would generate additional annual earnings of about
$192 
.
3. Slow down payments. Rather than paying her bills immediately on receipt,
Megan can pay her bills nearer their due date. By doing this she can gain 
8 days of disbursement float each month, or 96 days per year (8 days per
month
12 months), on an average of $1,900 of bills. Assuming she can earn
4.2% annual interest on the $1,900, slowing down her payments would save
about $21 annually 
.
Based on these three recommendations, Megan would increase her annual
earnings by a total of about 
. Clearly, Megan can
grow her earnings by better managing her cash balances.

Short-Term Financial Decisions

INVESTING IN MARKETABLE SECURITIES
Marketable securities are short-term, interest-earning, money market instruments
that can easily be converted into cash. Marketable securities are classified as part
of the firm’s liquid assets. The firm uses them to earn a return on temporarily idle
funds. To be truly marketable, a security must have (1) a ready market so as to
minimize the amount of time required to convert it into cash, and (2) safety of
principal, which means that it experiences little or no loss in value over time.
The securities that are most commonly held as part of the firm’s marketable-
securities portfolio are divided into two groups: (1) government issues, which
have relatively low yields as a consequence of their low risk; and (2) nongovern-
ment issues, which have slightly higher yields than government issues with similar
maturities because of the slightly higher risk associated with them. Table 15.5
summarizes the key features for popular marketable securities.

Summary
FOCUS ON VALUE
It is important for a firm to maintain a reasonable level of net working capital.
To do so, it must balance the high profit and high risk associated with low levels
of current assets and high levels of current liabilities against the low profit and
low risk that result from high levels of current assets and low levels of current
liabilities. A strategy that achieves a reasonable balance between profits and risk
should positively contribute to the firm’s value.
Similarly, the firm should manage its cash conversion cycle by turning
inventory quickly; collecting accounts receivable quickly; managing mail, pro-
cessing, and clearing time; and paying accounts payable slowly. These strategies
should enable the firm to manage its current accounts efficiently and to mini-
mize the amount of resources invested in operating assets.

The financial manager can manage inventory, accounts receivable, and cash
receipts to minimize the firm’s operating cycle investment, thereby reducing the
amount of resources needed to support its business. Employing these strategies,
and managing accounts payable and cash disbursements so as to shorten the
cash conversion cycle, should minimize the negotiated liabilities needed to sup-
port the firm’s resource requirements. Active management of the firm’s net
working capital and current assets should positively contribute to the firm’s goal
of maximizing its stock price.
REVIEW OF LEARNING GOALS
Understand working capital management, net working capital, and the
related trade-off between profitability and risk. Working capital (or short-term
financial) management focuses on managing each of the firm’s current assets
(inventory, accounts receivable, cash, and marketable securities) and current lia-
bilities (accounts payable, accruals, and notes payable) in a manner that posi-
tively contributes to the firm’s value. Net working capital is the difference
between current assets and current liabilities. Risk, in the context of short-term
financial decisions, is the probability that a firm will be unable to pay its bills as
they come due. Assuming a constant level of total assets, the higher a firm’s
ratio of current assets to total assets, the less profitable the firm and the less
risky it is. The converse is also true. With constant total assets, the higher a
firm’s ratio of current liabilities to total assets, the more profitable and the more
risky the firm is. The converse of this statement is also true.
Describe the cash conversion cycle, its funding requirements, and the key
strategies for managing it. The cash conversion cycle has three components: 
(1) average age of inventory, (2) average collection period, and (3) average pay-
ment period. The length of the cash conversion cycle determines the amount of
time resources are tied up in the firm’s day-to-day operations. The firm’s invest-
ment in short-term assets often consists of both permanent and seasonal funding
requirements. The seasonal requirements can be financed using either an aggres-
sive (low-cost, high-risk) financing strategy or a conservative (high-cost, low-risk)
financing strategy. The firm’s funding decision for its cash conversion cycle ulti-
mately depends on management’s disposition toward risk and the strength of the
firm’s banking relationships. To minimize its reliance on negotiated liabilities, the
financial manager seeks to (1) turn over inventory as quickly as possible, (2) col-
lect accounts receivable as quickly as possible, (3) manage mail, processing, and
clearing time, and (4) pay accounts payable as slowly as possible. Use of these
strategies should minimize the length of the cash conversion cycle.
Discuss inventory management: differing views, common techniques,
and international concerns. The viewpoints of marketing, manufacturing, and
purchasing managers about the appropriate levels of inventory tend to cause
higher inventories than those deemed appropriate by the financial manager.
Four commonly used techniques for effectively managing inventory to keep its
level low are (1) the ABC system, (2) the economic order quantity (EOQ) model,
(3) the just-in-time (JIT) system, and (4) computerized systems for resource con-
trol—MRP, MRP II, and ERP. International inventory managers place greater
emphasis on making sure that sufficient quantities of inventory are delivered

where and when needed, and in the right condition, than on ordering the eco-
nomically optimal quantities.
Explain the credit selection process and the quantitative procedure for
evaluating changes in credit standards. Credit selection techniques determine
which customers’ creditworthiness is consistent with the firm’s credit standards.
Two popular credit selection techniques are the five C’s of credit and credit
scoring. Changes in credit standards can be evaluated mathematically by
assessing the effects of a proposed change on profits from sales, the cost of
accounts receivable investment, and bad-debt costs.
Review the procedures for quantitatively considering cash discount
changes, other aspects of credit terms, and credit monitoring. Changes in credit
terms—the cash discount, the cash discount period, and the credit period—can
be quantified similarly to changes in credit standards. Credit monitoring, the
ongoing review of accounts receivable, frequently involves use of the average
collection period and an aging schedule. Firms use a number of popular collec-
tion techniques.
Understand the management of receipts and disbursements, including
float, speeding up collections, slowing down payments, cash concentration,
zero-balance accounts, and investing in marketable securities. Float refers to
funds that have been sent by the payer but are not yet usable funds to the payee.
The components of float are mail time, processing time, and clearing time. Float
occurs in both the average collection period and the average payment period.
One technique for speeding up collections is a lockbox system. A popular tech-
nique for slowing payments is controlled disbursing.
The goal for managing operating cash is to balance the opportunity cost of
nonearning balances against the transaction cost of temporary investments.
Firms commonly use depository transfer checks (DTCs), ACH transfers, and
wire transfers to transfer lockbox receipts to their concentration banks quickly.
Zero-balance accounts (ZBAs) can be used to eliminate nonearning cash bal-
ances in corporate checking accounts. Marketable securities are short-term,
interest-earning, money market instruments used by the firm to earn a return on
temporarily idle funds. They may be government or nongovernment issues.

Marginal costs
Jimmy Johnson is interested in buying a new Jeep SUV. There are
two options available, a V-6 model and a V-8 model. Whichever model he chooses,
he plans to drive it for a period of 5 years and then sell it. Assume that the trade-in
value of the two vehicles at the end of the 5-year ownership period will be identical.
There are definite differences between the two models, and Jimmy needs to
make a financial comparison. The manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) of
the V-6 and V-8 are $30,260 and $44,320, respectively. Jimmy believes the differ-
ence of $14,060 to be the marginal cost difference between the two vehicles.
However, there is much more data available, and you suggest to Jimmy that his
analysis may be too simple and will lead him to a poor financial decision. Assume
that the prevailing discount rate for both vehicles is 5.5% annually. Other pertinent

Spreadsheet Exercise
The current balance in accounts receivable for Eboy Corporation is $443,000. This
level was achieved with annual (365 days) credit sales of $3,544,000. The firm offers
its customers credit terms of net 30. However, in an effort to help its cash flow posi-
tion and to follow the actions of its rivals, the firm is considering changing its credit
terms from net 30 to 2/10 net 30. The objective is to speed up the receivable collec-
tions and thereby improve the firm’s cash flows. Eboy would like to increase its
accounts receivable turnover to 12.0.
The firm works with a raw material whose current annual usage is 1,450 units.
Each finished product requires one unit of this raw material at a variable cost of
$2,600 per unit and sells for $4,200 on terms of net 30. It is estimated that 70% of
the firm’s customers will take the 2% cash discount and that, with the discount, sales
of the finished product will increase by 50 units per year. The firm’s opportunity cost
of funds invested in accounts receivable is 12.5%
In analyzing the investment in accounts receivable, use the variable cost of the
product sold instead of the sale price, because the variable cost is a better indicator of
the firm’s investment.
TO DO
Create a spreadsheet similar to Table 15.3 to analyze whether the firm should initiate
the proposed cash discount. What is your advice? Make sure you calculate the fol-
lowing:
a. Additional profit contribution from sales.
b. Average investment in accounts receivable at present (without cash discount).

Why This Chapter Matters to You
In your professional life
ACCOUNTING You need to understand how to analyze supplier
credit terms to decide whether the firm should take or give up cash dis-
counts; you also need to understand the various types of short-term
loans, both unsecured and secured, that you will be required to record
and report.
INFORMATION SYSTEMS You need to understand what data the firm
will need to process accounts payable, track accruals, and meet bank
loans and other short-term debt obligations in a timely manner.
MANAGEMENT You need to know the sources of short-term loans so
that, if short-term financing is needed, you will understand its avail-
ability and cost.
MARKETING You need to understand how accounts receivable and
inventory can be used as loan collateral; the procedures used by the
firm to secure short-term loans with such collateral could affect customer
relationships.
OPERATIONS You need to understand the use of accounts payable as
a form of short-term financing and the effect on one’s suppliers of
stretching payables; you also need to understand the process by which
a firm uses inventory as collateral.
Management of current liabilities is
an important part of your financial
strategy. It takes discipline to avoid viewing cash and credit purchases
equally. You need to borrow for a purpose, not convenience. You need
to repay credit purchases in a timely fashion. Excessive use of short-
term credit, particularly with credit cards, can create personal liquidity
problems and, at the extreme, personal bankruptcy.

Reducing Accounts Payable Expenses
A
utomating accounts payables can save both
time and expense. Much of the savings comes
from eliminating the processing of paper invoices—a
time-consuming process of matching purchase orders
with invoices, checking that shipments or services were
received, and then writing and mailing a check. For
decades, nearly every large company employed staffs
of dozens of accounts payable clerks to do the work.
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, the
New York–based nonprofit medical research and health care institution, was looking for a better
way to process the nearly half-million invoices it receives annually from suppliers. It turned to
JPMorgan Business Settlement Network, which provides a network that enables companies to
issue purchase orders, receive invoices, and make electronic payments to suppliers.
Sloan-Kettering’s goal was to speed up the payment process while eliminating paper
invoicing and most of the labor-intensive work of matching invoices and purchase orders. Sloan-
Kettering was determined to convince hundreds of major suppliers to change the way they billed
the organization for some $413 million worth of goods and services. “People don’t realize that
what you save on printing a check is nowhere near the costs associated with entering an invoice
into an ERP system, ensuring that the data on the invoice is valid, and handling a dispute. Simply
placing the burden of resolving an invoice discrepancy onto the supplier is a tremendous cost
savings,” said Barbara Cassera, manager of financial systems at Sloan-Kettering.
By moving to JPMorgan Order-to-Pay Processing, the percentage of electronic invoices
went from 50 percent to 75 percent in the first year. The cash conversion cycle dropped from
80 to just 20 days on average. On-time payment jumped to 95 percent of all invoices, and dis-
counts are generated on more than 50 percent of all invoices. With the ability to validate
invoices in real time, Sloan-Kettering has eliminated exceptions on 16 percent of invoices that
contained them. When errors are detected, the electronic processing service automatically sends
all problem invoices back to suppliers for correction and resubmission.
By making these strategic changes, Sloan-Kettering is receiving more than $500,000
annually in supplier discounts. In addition, Sloan-Kettering has found that the time saved on the
sheer volume of invoices processed electronically has enabled the accounts payable department
to reduce its full-time staff, saving more than $120,000 annually.

PART 7
Short-Term Financial Decisions
16.1 Spontaneous Liabilities
Spontaneous liabilities arise from the normal course of business. For example,
when a retailer orders goods for inventory, the manufacturer of those goods usu-
ally does not demand immediate payment but instead extends a short-term loan
to the retailer that appears on the retailer’s balance sheet under accounts payable.
The more goods the retailer orders, the greater will be the accounts payable bal-
ance. Also in response to increasing sales, the firm’s accruals increase as wages
and taxes rise because of greater labor requirements and the increased taxes on
the firm’s increased earnings. There is normally no explicit cost attached to either
of these current liabilities, although they do have certain implicit costs. In addi-
tion, both are forms of unsecured short-term financing—short-term financing
obtained without pledging specific assets as collateral. The firm should take
advantage of these “interest-free” sources of unsecured short-term financing
whenever possible.
ACCOUNTS PAYABLE MANAGEMENT
Accounts payable are the major source of unsecured short-term financing for
business firms. They result from transactions in which merchandise is purchased
but no formal note is signed to show the purchaser’s liability to the seller. The
purchaser in effect agrees to pay the supplier the amount required in accordance
with credit terms normally stated on the supplier’s invoice. The discussion of
accounts payable here is presented from the viewpoint of the purchaser.
Role in the Cash Conversion Cycle
The average payment period is the final component of the cash conversion cycle
introduced in Chapter 15. The average payment period has two parts: (1) the
time from the purchase of raw materials until the firm mails the payment and
(2) payment float time (the time it takes after the firm mails its payment until
the supplier has withdrawn spendable funds from the firm’s account). In the
preceding chapter, we discussed issues related to payment float time. Here we
discuss the firm’s management of the time that elapses between its purchase of
raw materials and its mailing payment to the supplier. This activity is accounts
payable management.
When the seller of goods charges no interest and offers no discount to the
buyer for early payment, the buyer’s goal is to pay as slowly as possible without
damaging its credit rating. This means that accounts should be paid on the last
day possible, given the supplier’s stated credit terms. For example, if the terms
are net 30, then the account should be paid 30 days from the beginning of the
credit period, which is typically either the date of invoice or the end of the
month (EOM) in which the purchase was made. This allows for the maximum
use of an interest-free loan from the supplier and will not damage the firm’s
credit rating (because the account is paid within the stated credit terms). In addi-
tion, some firms offer an explicit or implicit “grace period” that extends a few
days beyond the stated payment date; if taking advantage of that grace period
does no harm to the buyer’s relationship with the seller, the buyer will typically
take advantage of the grace period.

and accounts payable of $14,809 million. HPQ had an average age of inventory
(AAI) of 29.2 days, an average collection period (ACP) of 53.3 days, and an average
payment period (APP) of 60.4 days (HPQ’s purchases were $89,492 million). Thus,
the cash conversion cycle for HPQ was 22.1 days 
.
The resources HPQ had invested in this cash conversion cycle (assuming a
365-day year) were

Based on HPQ’s APP and average accounts payable, the daily accounts
payable generated by HPQ is $245,183,562 ($14,809,087,123
60.4). If HPQ
were to increase its average payment period by 5 days, its accounts payable
would increase by about $1,226 million (5
$245,183,562). As a result, HPQ’s
cash conversion cycle would decrease by 5 days, and the firm would reduce its
investment in operations by $1,226 million. Clearly, if this action did not damage
HPQ’s credit rating, it would be in the company’s best interest.
Analyzing Credit Terms
The credit terms that a firm is offered by its suppliers enable it to delay payments
for its purchases. Because the supplier’s cost of having its money tied up in mer-
chandise after it is sold is probably reflected in the purchase price, the purchaser
is already indirectly paying for this benefit. Sometimes a supplier will offer a cash
discount for early payment. In that case, the purchaser should carefully analyze
credit terms to determine the best time to repay the supplier. The purchaser must
weigh the benefits of paying the supplier as late as possible against the costs of
passing up the discount for early payment.
Taking the Cash Discount
If a firm intends to take a cash discount, it
should pay on the last day of the discount period. There is no added benefit from
paying earlier than that date.
Lawrence Industries, operator of a small chain of video stores, purchased $1,000
worth of merchandise on February 27 from a supplier extending terms of 
2/10 net 30 EOM. If the firm takes the cash discount, it must pay $980
by March 10, thereby saving $20.
Giving Up the Cash Discount
If the firm chooses to give up the cash dis-
count, it should pay on the final day of the credit period. There is an implicit cost
associated with giving up a cash discount. The cost of giving up a cash discount is
the implied rate of interest paid to delay payment of an account payable for an
additional number of days. In other words, when a firm gives up a discount, it
pays a higher cost for the goods that it orders. The higher cost that the firm pays
is like interest on a loan, and the length of this loan is the number of additional

days that the purchaser can delay payment to the seller. This cost can be illus-
trated by a simple example. The example assumes that payment will be made on
the last possible day (either the final day of the cash discount period or the final
day of the credit period).
In Example 16.2, we saw that Lawrence Industries could take the cash discount on
its February 27 purchase by paying $980 on March 10. If Lawrence gives up the
cash discount, it can pay on March 30. To keep its money for an extra 20 days, the
firm must give up an opportunity to pay $980 for its $1,000 purchase. In other
words, it will cost the firm $20 to delay payment for 20 days. Figure 16.1 shows
the payment options that are open to the company.
To calculate the cost of giving up the cash discount, the true purchase price
must be viewed as the discounted cost of the merchandise, which is $980 for
Lawrence Industries. Another way to say this is that Lawrence Industries’ sup-
plier charges $980 for the goods as long as the bill is paid in 10 days. If Lawrence
takes 20 additional days to pay (by paying on day 30 rather than on day 10), they
have to pay the supplier an additional $20 in “interest.” Therefore, the interest
rate on this transaction is 2.04% ($20
$980). Keep in mind that the 2.04%
interest rate applies to a 20-day loan. To calculate an annualized interest rate, we
multiply the interest rate on this transaction times the number of 20-day periods
during a year. Equation 16.1 provides the general expression for calculating the
annual percentage cost of giving up a cash discount:1

Substituting the values for CD (2%) and N (20 days) into Equation 16.1
results in an annualized cost of giving up the cash discount of 37.24%
.
A simple way to approximate the cost of giving up a cash discount is to use the
stated cash discount percentage, CD, in place of the first term of Equation 16.1:
(16.2)
The smaller the cash discount, the closer the approximation to the actual cost of
giving it up. Using this approximation, the cost of giving up the cash discount for
Lawrence Industries is 36.5% 
.
Using the Cost of Giving Up a Cash Discount in Decision Making
The
financial manager must determine whether it is advisable to take a cash discount.
A primary consideration influencing this decision is the cost of other short-term
sources of funding. When a firm can obtain financing from a bank or other insti-
tution at a lower cost than the implicit interest rate offered by its suppliers, the
firm is better off borrowing from the bank and taking the discount offered by the
supplier.
Mason Products, a large building-supply company, has four possible suppliers,
each offering different credit terms. Otherwise, their products and services are
identical. Table 16.1 presents the credit terms offered by suppliers A, B, C, and D
and the cost of giving up the cash discounts in each transaction. The approxima-
tion method of calculating the cost of giving up a cash discount (Equation 16.2)
has been used. The cost of giving up the cash discount from supplier A is 36.5%;
from supplier B, 8.1%; from supplier C, 21.9%; and from supplier D, 29.2%.
If the firm needs short-term funds, which it can borrow from its bank at an
interest rate of 13%, and if each of the suppliers is viewed separately, which (if
any) of the suppliers’ cash discounts will the firm give up? In dealing with supplier
A, the firm takes the cash discount, because the cost of giving it up is 36.5%, and

then borrows the funds it requires from its bank at 13% interest. With supplier B,
the firm would do better to give up the cash discount, because the cost of this
action is less than the cost of borrowing money from the bank (8.1% versus 13%).
With either supplier C or supplier D, the firm should take the cash discount,
because in both cases the cost of giving up the discount is greater than the 13%
cost of borrowing from the bank.
The example shows that the cost of giving up a cash discount is relevant when
one is evaluating a single supplier’s credit terms in light of certain bank borrowing
costs. However, other factors relative to payment strategies may also need to be con-
sidered. For example, some firms, particularly small firms and poorly managed
firms, routinely give up all discounts because they either lack alternative sources of
unsecured short-term financing or fail to recognize the implicit costs of their actions.
Effects of Stretching Accounts Payable
A strategy that is often employed by a firm is stretching accounts payable—that
is, paying bills as late as possible without damaging its credit rating. Such a
strategy can reduce the cost of giving up a cash discount.
Lawrence Industries was extended credit terms of 2/10 net 30 EOM. The cost of
giving up the cash discount, assuming payment on the last day of the credit
period, was approximately 36.5% 
. If the firm were able to
stretch its account payable to 70 days without damaging its credit rating, the cost
of giving up the cash discount would be only 12.2% 
.
Stretching accounts payable reduces the implicit cost of giving up a cash discount.
Although stretching accounts payable may be financially attractive, it raises
an important ethical issue: It may cause the firm to violate the agreement it
entered into with its supplier when it purchased merchandise. Clearly, a supplier
would not look kindly on a customer who regularly and purposely postponed
paying for purchases.
Jack and Mary Nobel, a young married couple, are in the
process of purchasing a 50-inch HD TV at a cost of $1,900.
The electronics dealer currently has a special financing plan that would 
allow them to either (1) put $200 down and finance the balance of $1,700 at 
3% annual interest over 24 months, resulting in payments of $73 per month; 
or (2) receive an immediate $150 cash rebate, thereby paying only $1,750 cash.
The Nobels, who have saved enough to pay cash for the TV, can currently earn
5% annual interest on their savings. They wish to determine whether to borrow
or to pay cash to purchase the TV.
The upfront outlay for the financing alternative is the $200 down payment,
whereas the Nobels will pay out $1,750 up front under the cash purchase alterna-
tive. So the cash purchase will require an initial outlay that is $1,550 ($1,750
$200) greater than under the financing alternative. Assuming that they can
earn a simple interest rate of 5% on savings, the cash purchase will cause the
Nobels to give up an opportunity to earn $155 
over
the 2 years.

If they choose the financing alternative, the $1,550 would grow to $1,705
($1,550
$155) at the end of 2 years. But under the financing alternative, the
Nobels will pay out a total of $1,752 (24 months
$73 per month) over the 2-year
loan term. The cost of the financing alternative can be viewed as $1,752, and the
cost of the cash payment (including forgone interest earnings) would be $1,705.
Because it is less expensive, the Nobels should pay cash for the TV. The lower
cost of the cash alternative is largely the result of the $150 cash rebate.
ACCRUALS
The second spontaneous source of short-term business financing is accruals.
Accruals are liabilities for services received for which payment has yet to be
made. The most common items accrued by a firm are wages and taxes. Because
taxes are payments to the government, their accrual cannot be manipulated by
the firm. However, the accrual of wages can be manipulated to some extent. This
is accomplished by delaying payment of wages, thereby receiving an interest-free
loan from employees who are paid sometime after they have performed the work.
The pay period for employees who earn an hourly rate is often governed by union
regulations or by state or federal law. However, in other cases, the frequency of
payment is at the discretion of the company’s management.

Accruals Management
On June 2, 2010,
Diebold, Inc., agreed
to pay a $25 million fine to settle
accounting fraud charges brought by
the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC). According to the
SEC, the management of the Ohio-
based manufacturer of ATMs, bank
security systems, and electronic voting
machines regularly received reports
comparing the company’s earnings to
analyst forecasts. When earnings were
below forecasts, management identified
opportunities, some of which amounted
to accounting fraud, to close the gap.
“Diebold’s financial executives bor-
rowed from many different chapters of
the deceptive accounting playbook to
fraudulently boost the company’s bottom
line,” SEC Enforcement Director Robert
Khuzami said in a statement. “When
executives disregard their professional
obligations to investors, both they and
their companies face significant legal
consequences.”a
A number of the SEC’s claims
focused on premature revenue recogni-
tion. For example, Diebold was charged
with improper use of “bill and hold”
transactions. Under generally accepted
accounting principles, revenue is typi-
cally recognized after a product is
shipped. However, in some cases, sellers
can recognize revenue before shipment
for certain bill and hold transactions. The
SEC claimed that Diebold improperly
used bill and hold accounting to record
revenue prematurely.
The SEC also claimed that Diebold
manipulated various accounting accru-
als. Diebold was accused of understat-
ing liabilities tied to its Long Term
Incentive Plan, commissions to be paid
to sales personnel, and incentives to be
paid to service personnel. Diebold tem-
porarily reduced a liability account set
up for payment of customer rebates.
The company was also accused of
overstating the value of inventory and
improper inventory write-ups.
Each of these activities allowed
Diebold to inflate the company’s finan-
cial performance. According to the
SEC’s complaint, Diebold’s fraudulent
activities misstated reported pretax earn-
ings by at least $127 million between
2002 and 2007. Two years prior to
the settlement, Diebold restated earnings
for the period covered by the charges.
The clawback provision of the 2002
Sarbanes-Oxley antifraud law requires
executives to repay compensation they
receive while their company misled share-
holders. Diebold’s former CEO, Walden
O’Dell, agreed to return $470,000 in
cash, plus stock and options. The SEC is
currently pursuing a lawsuit against three
other former Diebold executives for their
part in the matter.
3 Why might financial managers
still be tempted to manage earn-
ings when a clawback is a legiti-
mate possibility?

Tenney Company, a large janitorial service company, currently pays its employees
at the end of each work week. The weekly payroll totals $400,000. If the firm
were to extend the pay period so as to pay its employees 1 week later throughout
an entire year, the employees would in effect be lending the firm $400,000 for a
year. If the firm could earn 10% annually on invested funds, such a strategy
would be worth $40,000 per year

Short-Term Financial Decisions
16.2 Unsecured Sources of Short-Term Loans
Businesses obtain unsecured short-term loans from two major sources, banks and
sales of commercial paper. Unlike the spontaneous sources of unsecured short-
term financing, bank loans and commercial paper are negotiated and result from
actions taken by the firm’s financial manager. Bank loans are more popular
because they are available to firms of all sizes; commercial paper tends to be
available only to large firms. In addition, firms can use international loans to
finance international transactions.
BANK LOANS
Banks are a major source of unsecured short-term loans to businesses. The major
type of loan made by banks to businesses is the short-term, self-liquidating loan.
These loans are intended merely to carry the firm through seasonal peaks in
financing needs that are due primarily to buildups of inventory and accounts
receivable. As the firm converts inventories and receivables into cash, the funds
needed to retire these loans are generated. In other words, the use to which the
borrowed money is put provides the mechanism through which the loan is
repaid—hence the term self-liquidating.
Banks lend unsecured, short-term funds in three basic ways: through single-
payment notes, lines of credit, and revolving credit agreements. Before we look at
these types of loans, we consider loan interest rates.
Loan Interest Rates
The interest rate on a bank loan can be a fixed or a floating rate, typically based
on the prime rate of interest. The prime rate of interest (prime rate) is the lowest
rate of interest charged by leading banks on business loans to their most important
business borrowers. The prime rate fluctuates with changing supply-and-demand

relationships for short-term funds. Banks generally determine the rate to be
charged to various borrowers by adding a premium to the prime rate to adjust
it for the borrower’s “riskiness.” The premium may amount to 4 percent or
more, although most unsecured short-term loans carry premiums of less than 
2 percent.
Fixed- and Floating-Rate Loans
Loans can have either fixed or floating
interest rates. On a fixed-rate loan, the rate of interest is determined at a set incre-
ment above the prime rate on the date of the loan and remains unvarying at that
fixed rate until maturity. On a floating-rate loan, the increment above the prime
rate is initially established, and the rate of interest is allowed to “float,” or vary,
above prime as the prime rate varies until maturity. Generally, the increment
above the prime rate will be lower on a floating-rate loan than on a fixed-rate
loan of equivalent risk because the lender bears less risk with a floating-rate loan.
As a result of the volatile nature of the prime rate during recent years, today most
short-term business loans are floating-rate loans.
Method of Computing Interest
Once the nominal (or stated) annual rate is
established, the method of computing interest is determined. Interest can be paid
either when a loan matures or in advance. If interest is paid at maturity, the
effective (or true) annual rate—the actual rate of interest paid—for an assumed 
1-year period is equal to
(16.3)
Most bank loans to businesses require the interest payment at maturity.
When interest is paid in advance, it is deducted from the loan so that the bor-
rower actually receives less money than is requested (and less than they must repay).
Loans on which interest is paid in advance are called discount loans. The effective
annual rate for a discount loan, assuming a 1-year period, is calculated as
(16.4)
Paying interest in advance raises the effective annual rate above the stated annual
rate.
Wooster Company, a manufacturer of athletic apparel, wants to borrow $10,000
at a stated annual rate of 10% interest for 1 year. If the interest on the loan is paid
at maturity, the firm will pay $1,000 (0.10
$10,000) for the use of the $10,000
for the year. At the end of the year, Wooster will write a check to the lender for
$11,000, consisting of the $1,000 interest as well as the return of the $10,000
principal. Substituting into Equation 16.3 reveals that the effective annual rate is
therefore
$1,000
$10,000 = 10.0%

If the money is borrowed at the same stated annual rate for 1 year but
interest is paid in advance, the firm still pays $1,000 in interest, but it receives
only $9,000 ($10,000
$1,000). The effective annual rate in this case is
In this case, at the end of the year Wooster writes a check to the lender for
$10,000, having “paid” the $1,000 in interest up front by borrowing just $9,000.
Paying interest in advance thus makes the effective annual rate (11.1%) greater
than the stated annual rate (10.0%).
Single-Payment Notes
A single-payment note can be obtained from a commercial bank by a credit-
worthy business borrower. This type of loan is usually a one-time loan made to a
borrower who needs funds for a specific purpose for a short period. The resulting
instrument is a note, signed by the borrower, that states the terms of the loan,
including the length of the loan and the interest rate. This type of short-term note
generally has a maturity of 30 days to 9 months or more. The interest charged is
usually tied in some way to the prime rate of interest.
Gordon Manufacturing, a producer of rotary mower blades, recently borrowed
$100,000 from each of two banks—bank A and bank B. The loans were incurred
on the same day, when the prime rate of interest was 6%. Each loan involved a
90-day note with interest to be paid at the end of 90 days. The interest rate
was set at 11/2% above the prime rate on bank A’s fixed-rate note. Over the 
90-day period, the rate of interest on this note will remain at 71/2% (6% prime 
rate
11/2% increment) regardless of fluctuations in the prime rate. The total
interest cost on this loan is 
, which
means that the 90-day rate on this loan is 1.85% ($1,849
$100,000).
Assuming that the loan from bank A is rolled over each 90 days throughout
the year under the same terms and circumstances, we can find its effective annual
interest rate by using Equation 5.17. Because the loan costs 1.85% for 90 days, it
is necessary to compound (1
0.0185) for 4.06 periods in the year (that is, 
365  90) and then subtract 1:
The effective annual rate of interest on the fixed-rate, 90-day note is 7.73%.
Bank B set the interest rate at 1% above the prime rate on its floating-rate note.
The rate charged over the 90 days will vary directly with the prime rate. Initially,
the rate will be 7% (6%
1%), but when the prime rate changes, so will the rate
of interest on the note. For instance, if after 30 days the prime rate rises to 6.5%,
and after another 30 days it drops to 6.25%, the firm will be paying 0.575% for the
first 30 days (7%
30
365), 0.616% for the next 30 days (7.5%
30
365),
and 0.596% for the last 30 days (7.25%
30
365). Its total interest cost will be
$1,787 
, resulting in a 90-day rate
of 1.79% ($1,787
$100,000).

Again, assuming the loan is rolled over each 90 days throughout the year

Megan Schwartz has been approved by Clinton National Bank
for a 180-day loan of $30,000 that will allow her to make the
down payment and close the loan on her new condo. She needs the funds to
bridge the time until the sale of her current condo, from which she expects to
receive $42,000.
Clinton National offered Megan the following two financing options for the
$30,000 loan: (1) a fixed-rate loan at 2% above the prime rate or (2) a variable-
rate loan at 1% above the prime rate. Currently, the prime rate of interest is 8%,
and the consensus forecast of a group of mortgage economists for changes in the
prime rate over the next 180 days is as follows:
60 days from today the prime rate will rise by 1%
90 days from today the prime rate will rise another 1/2%
150 days from today the prime rate will drop by 1%
Using the forecast prime rate changes, Megan wishes to determine the lowest
interest-cost loan for the next 6 months.
Fixed-Rate Loan: Total interest cost over 180 days
Variable-Rate Loan: The applicable interest rate would begin at 9% (8%
1%)
and remain there for 60 days. Then the applicable rate would rise to 10%
(9%
1%) for the next 30 days, and then to 10.50% (10%
0.50%) for the
next 60 days. Finally the applicable rate would drop to 9.50% (10.50%
1%)
for the final 30 days.
Total interest cost over 180 days
Because the estimated total interest cost on the variable-rate loan of $1,442 is
less than the total interest cost of $1,480 on the fixed-rate loan, Megan should take
the variable-rate loan. By doing this she will save about $38 ($1,480
$1,442) in
interest cost over the 180 days.
Lines of Credit
A line of credit is an agreement between a commercial bank and a business, spec-
ifying the amount of unsecured short-term borrowing the bank will make avail-
able to the firm over a given period of time. It is similar to the agreement under
-

borrowing the bank will make

given period of time.

which issuers of bank credit cards, such as MasterCard, Visa, and Discover,
extend preapproved credit to cardholders. A line-of-credit agreement is typically
made for a period of 1 year and often places certain constraints on the borrower.
It is not a guaranteed loan but indicates that if the bank has sufficient funds avail-
able, it will allow the borrower to owe it up to a certain amount of money. The
amount of a line of credit is the maximum amount the firm can owe the bank at
any point in time.
When applying for a line of credit, the borrower may be required to submit
such documents as its cash budget, pro forma income statement, pro forma bal-
ance sheet, and recent financial statements. If the bank finds the customer accept-
able, the line of credit will be extended. The major attraction of a line of credit
from the bank’s point of view is that it eliminates the need to examine the credit-
worthiness of a customer each time it borrows money within the year.
Interest Rates
The interest rate on a line of credit is normally stated as a
floating rate—the prime rate plus a premium. If the prime rate changes, the
interest rate charged on new as well as outstanding borrowing automatically
changes. The amount a borrower is charged in excess of the prime rate depends
on its creditworthiness. The more creditworthy the borrower, the lower the pre-
mium (interest increment) above prime, and vice versa.
Operating-Change Restrictions
In a line-of-credit agreement, a bank may
impose operating-change restrictions, which give it the right to revoke the line if
any major changes occur in the firm’s financial condition or operations. The firm
is usually required to submit up-to-date, and preferably audited, financial state-
ments for periodic review. In addition, the bank typically needs to be informed of
shifts in key managerial personnel or in the firm’s operations before changes take
place. Such changes may affect the future success and debt-paying ability of the
firm and thus could alter its credit status. If the bank does not agree with the pro-
posed changes and the firm makes them anyway, the bank has the right to revoke
the line of credit.
Compensating Balances
To ensure that the borrower will be a “good cus-
tomer,” many short-term unsecured bank loans—single-payment notes and lines
of credit—require the borrower to maintain, in a checking account, a
compensating balance equal to a certain percentage of the amount borrowed.
Banks frequently require compensating balances of 10 to 20 percent. A compen-
sating balance not only forces the borrower to be a good customer of the bank
but may also raise the interest cost to the borrower.
Estrada Graphics, a graphic design firm, has borrowed $1 million under a line-of-
credit agreement. It must pay a stated interest rate of 10% and maintain, in its
checking account, a compensating balance equal to 20% of the amount borrowed,
or $200,000. Thus it actually receives the use of only $800,000. To use that
amount for a year, the firm pays interest of $100,000 (0.10
$1,000,000). The
effective annual rate on the funds is therefore 12.5% ($100,000
$800,000),
2.5% more than the stated rate of 10%.
If the firm normally maintains a balance of $200,000 or more in its checking
account, the effective annual rate equals the stated annual rate of 10% because

none of the $1 million borrowed is needed to satisfy the compensating-balance
requirement. If the firm normally maintains a $100,000 balance in its checking
account, only an additional $100,000 will have to be tied up, leaving it with
$900,000 of usable funds. The effective annual rate in this case would be 11.1%
($100,000
$900,000). Thus a compensating balance raises the cost of bor-
rowing only if it is larger than the firm’s normal cash balance.
Annual Cleanups
To ensure that money lent under a line-of-credit agree-
ment is actually being used to finance seasonal needs, many banks require an
annual cleanup. This means that the borrower must have a loan balance of
zero—that is, owe the bank nothing—for a certain number of days during the
year. Insisting that the borrower carry a zero loan balance for a certain period
ensures that short-term loans do not turn into long-term loans.
All the characteristics of a line-of-credit agreement are negotiable to some
extent. Today, banks bid competitively to attract large, well-known firms. A
prospective borrower should attempt to negotiate a line of credit with the most
favorable interest rate, for an optimal amount of funds, and with a minimum of
restrictions. Borrowers today frequently pay fees to lenders instead of main-
taining deposit balances as compensation for loans and other services. The lender
attempts to get a good return with maximum safety. Negotiations should produce
a line of credit that is suitable to both borrower and lender.
Revolving Credit Agreements
A revolving credit agreement is nothing more than a guaranteed line of credit. It
is guaranteed in the sense that the commercial bank assures the borrower that a
specified amount of funds will be made available regardless of the scarcity of
money. The interest rate and other requirements are similar to those for a line of
credit. It is not uncommon for a revolving credit agreement to be for a period
greater than 1 year.2 Because the bank guarantees the availability of funds, a
commitment fee is normally charged on a revolving credit agreement. This fee
often applies to the average unused balance of the borrower’s credit line. It is nor-
mally about 0.5 percent of the average unused portion of the line.
REH Company, a major real estate developer, has a $2 million revolving credit
agreement with its bank. Its average borrowing under the agreement for the past
year was $1.5 million. The bank charges a commitment fee of 0.5% on the
average unused balance. Because the average unused portion of the committed
funds was $500,000 ($2 million
$1.5 million), the commitment fee for the
year was $2,500 (0.005
$500,000). Of course, REH also had to pay interest
on the actual $1.5 million borrowed under the agreement. Assuming that
$112,500 interest was paid on the $1.5 million borrowed, the effective cost of the
agreement was 7.67% 
. Although more
expensive than a line of credit, a revolving credit agreement can be less risky from
the borrower’s viewpoint, because the availability of funds is guaranteed.

2. Many authors classify the revolving credit agreement as a form of intermediate-term financing, defined as having
a maturity of 1 to 7 years. In this text, we do not use the intermediate-term financing classification; only short-term
and long-term classifications are made. Because many revolving credit agreements are for more than 1 year, they can
be classified as a form of long-term financing; however, they are discussed here because of their similarity to line-of-
credit agreements.

COMMERCIAL PAPER
Commercial paper is a form of financing that consists of short-term, unsecured
promissory notes issued by firms with a high credit standing. Generally, only large
firms of unquestionable financial soundness are able to issue commercial paper. Most
commercial paper issues have maturities ranging from 3 to 270 days. Although there
is no set denomination, such financing is generally issued in multiples of $100,000 or
more. A large portion of the commercial paper today is issued by finance companies;
manufacturing firms account for a smaller portion of this type of financing.
Businesses often purchase commercial paper, which they hold as marketable securi-
ties, to provide an interest-earning reserve of liquidity. For further information on
recent use of commercial paper, see the Focus on Practice box.
Interest on Commercial Paper
Commercial paper is sold at a discount from its par, or face, value. The size of the
discount and the length of time to maturity determine the interest paid by the

Even with the CPFF up and run-

about their ability to roll over their out-
standing commercial paper every few
weeks turned to long-term debt to meet
their liquidity needs. Merrill Lynch &
Co. and Bloomberg data showed that,
to manage short-tem liability risk, com-
panies were paying as much as $75
million in additional annual interest to
swap long-term debt for $1 billion of
30-day commercial paper.
With the recession in the rearview
mirror and short-term credit markets
working again, the CPFF was closed
on February 1, 2010. As of mid-
2010, the U.S. commercial paper mar-
ket appeared to be hitting bottom at
around $1.06 trillion and showing
signs of recovering.

for other strategic activities—mergers and
acquisitions and long-term capital invest-
ments, among others. According to
Federal Reserve Board data, at the end
of July 2004, total U.S. commercial
paper outstanding was $1.33 trillion.
By 2006, commercial paper surged
to $1.98 trillion—an increase of 21.5
percent over 2005 levels. However,
after peaking at $2.22 trillion, the tide
changed in response to the credit crisis
that began in August 2007. According
to Federal Reserve data, as of October 1,
2008, the commercial paper market
had contracted to $1.6 trillion, a reduc-
tion of nearly 28 percent, and new
issues virtually dried up for several
weeks. With much of the commercial
paper outstanding at the start of the
credit crisis coming up for renewal, the
Federal Reserve began operating the
Commercial Paper Funding Facility
(CPFF) on October 27, 2008. The
CPFF was intended to provide a liquidity
backstop to U.S. issuers of commercial
paper and, thereby, increase the avail-
ability of credit in short-term capital mar-
kets. CPFF allowed for the Federal

The difficult economic
and credit environment
in the post–September 11 era, com-
bined with historically low interest rates
and a deep desire by corporate issuers
to reduce exposure to refinancing risk,
had a depressing effect on commercial
paper volumes from 2001 through
2003. According to the Federal
Reserve, U.S. nonfinancial commercial
paper, for example, declined 68 per-
cent over the 3-year period, from
$315.8 billion outstanding at the
beginning of 2001 to $101.4 billion
by December 2003. In addition to
lower volume, credit quality of commer-
cial paper declined over the same
period, with the ratio of downgrades
outpacing upgrades 17 to 1 in 2002.
In 2004, signs emerged that the vol-
ume and rating contraction in commer-
cial paper was finally coming to an end.
The most encouraging of these was the
pickup in economic growth, which spurs
the need for short-term debt to finance
corporate working capital. Although
commercial paper is typically used to
fund working capital, it is often boosted
by a sudden surge of borrowing activity

issuer of commercial paper. The actual interest earned by the purchaser is deter-
mined by certain calculations, illustrated by the following example.
Bertram Corporation, a large shipbuilder, has just issued $1 million worth of com-
mercial paper that has a 90-day maturity and sells for $990,000. At the end of 90
days, the purchaser of this paper will receive $1 million for its $990,000 invest-
ment. The interest paid on the financing is therefore $10,000 on a principal of
$990,000. The effective 90-day rate on the paper is 1.01% ($10,000
$990,000).
Assuming that the paper is rolled over each 90 days throughout the year (that is,
365
90
4.06 times per year), the effective annual rate for Bertram’s commercial
paper, found by using Equation 4.24, is 4.16% 
.
An interesting characteristic of commercial paper is that its interest cost is
normally 2 percent to 4 percent below the prime rate. In other words, firms are
able to raise funds more cheaply by selling commercial paper than by borrowing
from a commercial bank. The reason is that many suppliers of short-term funds
do not have the option, as banks do, of making low-risk business loans at the
prime rate. They can invest safely only in marketable securities such as Treasury
bills and commercial paper.
Although the stated interest cost of borrowing through the sale of commercial
paper is normally lower than the prime rate, the overall cost of commercial paper
may not be less than that of a bank loan. Additional costs include various fees and
flotation costs. In addition, even if it is slightly more expensive to borrow from a
commercial bank, it may at times be advisable to do so to establish a good
working relationship with a bank. This strategy ensures that when money is tight,
funds can be obtained promptly and at a reasonable interest rate.

Matter of fact
C
ommercial banks are legally prohibited from lending amounts in excess of 15 percent (plus
an additional 10 percent for loans secured by readily marketable collateral) of the bank’s
unimpaired capital and surplus to any one borrower. This restriction is intended to protect deposi-
tors by forcing the commercial bank to spread its risk across a number of borrowers. In addition,
smaller commercial banks do not have many opportunities to lend to large, high-quality business
borrowers.
Lending Limits
INTERNATIONAL LOANS
In some ways, arranging short-term financing for international trade is no dif-
ferent from financing purely domestic operations. In both cases, producers must
finance production and inventory and then continue to finance accounts receiv-
able before collecting any cash payments from sales. In other ways, however, the
short-term financing of international sales and purchases is fundamentally dif-
ferent from that of strictly domestic trade.
International Transactions
The important difference between international and domestic transactions is that
payments are often made or received in a foreign currency. Not only must a U.S.
company pay the costs of doing business in the foreign exchange market, but it

also is exposed to exchange rate risk. A U.S.-based company that exports goods
and has accounts receivable denominated in a foreign currency faces the risk that
the U.S. dollar will appreciate in value relative to the foreign currency. The risk to
a U.S. importer with foreign-currency-denominated accounts payable is that the
dollar will depreciate. Although exchange rate risk can often be hedged by using
currency forward, futures, or options markets, doing so is costly and is not pos-
sible for all foreign currencies.
Typical international transactions are large in size and have long maturity
dates. Therefore, companies that are involved in international trade generally
have to finance larger dollar amounts for longer time periods than companies
that operate domestically. Furthermore, because foreign companies are rarely
well known in the United States, some financial institutions are reluctant to lend
to U.S. exporters or importers, particularly smaller firms.
Financing International Trade
Several specialized techniques have evolved for financing international trade.
Perhaps the most important financing vehicle is the letter of credit, a letter
written by a company’s bank to the company’s foreign supplier, stating that the
bank guarantees payment of an invoiced amount if all the underlying agreements
are met. The letter of credit essentially substitutes the bank’s reputation and cred-
itworthiness for that of its commercial customer. A U.S. exporter is more willing
to sell goods to a foreign buyer if the transaction is covered by a letter of credit
issued by a well-known bank in the buyer’s home country.
Firms that do business in foreign countries on an ongoing basis often finance
their operations, at least in part, in the local market. A company that has an
assembly plant in Mexico, for example, might choose to finance its purchases of
Mexican goods and services with peso funds borrowed from a Mexican bank.
This not only minimizes exchange rate risk but also improves the company’s busi-
ness ties to the host community. Multinational companies, however, sometimes
finance their international transactions through dollar-denominated loans from
international banks. The Eurocurrency loan markets allow creditworthy bor-
rowers to obtain financing on attractive terms.
Transactions between Subsidiaries
Much international trade involves transactions between corporate subsidiaries. A
U.S. company might, for example, manufacture one part in an Asian plant and
another part in the United States, assemble the product in Brazil, and sell it in
Europe. The shipment of goods back and forth between subsidiaries creates
accounts receivable and accounts payable, but the parent company has consider-
able discretion about how and when payments are made. In particular, the parent
can minimize foreign exchange fees and other transaction costs by “netting”
what affiliates owe each other and paying only the net amount due, rather than
having both subsidiaries pay each other the gross amounts due.

16.3 Secured Sources of Short-Term Loans
When a firm has exhausted its sources of unsecured short-term financing, it may
be able to obtain additional short-term loans on a secured basis. Secured short-
term financing has specific assets pledged as collateral. The collateral commonly
takes the form of an asset, such as accounts receivable or inventory. The lender
obtains a security interest in the collateral through the execution of a security
agreement with the borrower that specifies the collateral held against the loan. In
addition, the terms of the loan against which the security is held form part of the
security agreement. A copy of the security agreement is filed in a public office
within the state—typically, a county or state court. Filing provides subsequent
lenders with information about which assets of a prospective borrower are
unavailable for use as collateral. The filing requirement protects the lender by
legally establishing the lender’s security interest.
CHARACTERISTICS OF SECURED SHORT-TERM LOANS
Although many people believe that holding collateral as security reduces the risk
that a loan will default, lenders do not usually view loans in this way. Lenders
recognize that holding collateral can reduce losses if the borrower defaults, but
the presence of collateral has no impact on the risk of default. A lender requires
collateral to ensure recovery of some portion of the loan in the event of default.
What the lender wants above all, however, is to be repaid as scheduled. In gen-
eral, lenders prefer to make less risky loans at lower rates of interest than to be in
a position in which they must liquidate collateral.
Collateral and Terms
Lenders of secured short-term funds prefer collateral that has a duration closely
matched to the term of the loan. Current assets are the most desirable short-term-
loan collateral because they can normally be converted into cash much sooner
than fixed assets. Thus, the short-term lender of secured funds generally accepts
only liquid current assets as collateral.

LG 5

security agreement
The agreement between the
borrower and the lender that
specifies the collateral held
against a secured loan.

Typically, the lender determines the desirable percentage advance to make
against the collateral. This percentage advance constitutes the principal of the
secured loan and is normally between 30 and 100 percent of the book value of
the collateral. It varies according to the type and liquidity of collateral.
The interest rate that is charged on secured short-term loans is typically
higher than the rate on unsecured short-term loans. Lenders do not normally con-
sider secured loans less risky than unsecured loans. In addition, negotiating and
administering secured loans is more troublesome for the lender than negotiating
and administering unsecured loans. The lender therefore normally requires added
compensation in the form of a service charge, a higher interest rate, or both.
Institutions Extending Secured Short-Term Loans
The primary sources of secured short-term loans to businesses are commercial banks
and commercial finance companies. Both institutions deal in short-term loans
secured primarily by accounts receivable and inventory. We have already described
the operations of commercial banks. Commercial finance companies are lending
institutions that make only secured loans—both short-term and long-term—to busi-
nesses. Unlike banks, finance companies are not permitted to hold deposits.
Only when its unsecured and secured short-term borrowing power from the
commercial bank is exhausted will a borrower turn to the commercial finance com-
pany for additional secured borrowing. Because the finance company generally
ends up with higher-risk borrowers, its interest charges on secured short-term loans
are usually higher than those of commercial banks. The leading U.S. commercial
finance companies include The CIT Group and GE Corporate Financial Services.
USE OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS COLLATERAL
Two commonly used means of obtaining short-term financing with accounts
receivable are pledging accounts receivable and factoring accounts receivable.
Actually, only a pledge of accounts receivable creates a secured short-term loan;
factoring really entails the sale of accounts receivable at a discount. Although fac-
toring is not actually a form of secured short-term borrowing, it does involve the
use of accounts receivable to obtain needed short-term funds.
Pledging Accounts Receivable
A pledge of accounts receivable is often used to secure a short-term loan. Because
accounts receivable are normally quite liquid, they are an attractive form of
short-term-loan collateral.
The Pledging Process
When a firm requests a loan against accounts receiv-
able, the lender first evaluates the firm’s accounts receivable to determine their
desirability as collateral. The lender makes a list of the acceptable accounts, along
with the billing dates and amounts. If the borrowing firm requests a loan for a
fixed amount, the lender needs to select only enough accounts to secure the funds
requested. If the borrower wants the maximum loan available, the lender evalu-
ates all the accounts to select the maximum amount of acceptable collateral.
After selecting the acceptable accounts, the lender normally adjusts the dollar
value of these accounts for expected returns on sales and other allowances. If a cus-
tomer whose account has been pledged returns merchandise or receives some type of
allowance, such as a cash discount for early payment, the amount of the collateral is

automatically reduced. For protection from such occurrences, the lender normally
reduces the value of the acceptable collateral by a fixed percentage.
Next, the percentage to be advanced against the collateral must be deter-
mined. The lender evaluates the quality of the acceptable receivables and the
expected cost of their liquidation. This percentage represents the principal of the
loan and typically ranges between 50 and 90 percent of the face value of accept-
able accounts receivable. To protect its interest in the collateral, the lender files a
lien, which is a publicly disclosed legal claim on the collateral.
Notification
Pledges of accounts receivable are normally made on a
nonnotification basis, meaning that a customer whose account has been pledged as
collateral is not notified. Under the nonnotification arrangement, the borrower still
collects the pledged account receivable, and the lender trusts the borrower to remit
these payments as they are received. If a pledge of accounts receivable is made on a
notification basis, the customer is notified to remit payment directly to the lender.
Pledging Cost
The stated cost of a pledge of accounts receivable is normally
2 to 5 percent above the prime rate. In addition to the stated interest rate, a
service charge of up to 3 percent may be levied by the lender to cover its adminis-
trative costs. Clearly, pledges of accounts receivable are a high-cost source of
short-term financing.
Factoring Accounts Receivable
Factoring accounts receivable involves selling them outright, at a discount, to a
financial institution. A factor is a financial institution that specializes in pur-
chasing accounts receivable from businesses. Although it is not the same as
obtaining a short-term loan, factoring accounts receivable is similar to borrowing
with accounts receivable as collateral.
Factoring Agreement
A factoring agreement normally states the exact condi-
tions and procedures for the purchase of an account. The factor, like a lender
against a pledge of accounts receivable, chooses accounts for purchase, selecting
only those that appear to be acceptable credit risks. Where factoring is to be on a
continuing basis, the factor will actually make the firm’s credit decisions because
this will guarantee the acceptability of accounts. Factoring is normally done on a
notification basis, and the factor receives payment of the account directly from the
customer. In addition, most sales of accounts receivable to a factor are made on a
nonrecourse basis, meaning that the factor agrees to accept all credit risks. Thus, if
a purchased account turns out to be uncollectible, the factor must absorb the loss.

Matter of fact
The use of credit cards such as MasterCard, Visa, and Discover by consumers has some similarity
to factoring because the vendor that accepts the card is reimbursed at a discount for purchases
made with the card. The difference between factoring and credit cards is that cards are nothing
more than a line of credit extended by the issuer, which charges the vendors a fee for accepting
the cards. In factoring, the factor does not analyze credit until after the sale has been made; in
many cases (except when factoring is done on a continuing basis), the initial credit decision is the
responsibility of the vendor, not the factor that purchases the account.
Quasi Factoring

Typically, the factor is not required to pay the firm until the account is col-
lected or until the last day of the credit period, whichever occurs first. The factor
sets up an account similar to a bank deposit account for each customer. As pay-
ment is received or as due dates arrive, the factor deposits money into the seller’s
account, from which the seller is free to make withdrawals as needed.
In many cases, if the firm leaves the money in the account, a surplus will exist
on which the factor will pay interest. In other instances, the factor may make
advances to the firm against uncollected accounts that are not yet due. These
advances represent a negative balance in the firm’s account, on which interest is
charged.
Factoring Cost
Factoring costs include commissions, interest levied on
advances, and interest earned on surpluses. The factor deposits in the firm’s
account the book value of the collected or due accounts purchased by the factor,
less the commissions. The commissions are typically stated as a 1 to 3 percent dis-
count from the book value of factored accounts receivable. The interest levied on
advances is generally 2 to 4 percent above the prime rate. It is levied on the actual
amount advanced. The interest paid on surpluses is generally between 0.2 percent
and 0.5 percent per month.
Although its costs may seem high, factoring has certain advantages that make
it attractive to many firms. One is the ability it gives the firm to turn accounts
receivable immediately into cash without having to worry about repayment.
Another advantage is that it ensures a known pattern of cash flows. In addition,
if factoring is undertaken on a continuing basis, the firm can eliminate its credit
and collection departments.
USE OF INVENTORY AS COLLATERAL
Inventory is generally second to accounts receivable in desirability as short-term
loan collateral. Inventory normally has a market value that is greater than its
book value, which is used to establish its value as collateral. A lender whose loan
is secured with inventory will probably be able to sell that inventory for at least
book value if the borrower defaults on its obligations.
The most important characteristic of inventory being evaluated as loan col-
lateral is marketability. A warehouse of perishable items, such as fresh peaches,
may be quite marketable, but if the cost of storing and selling the peaches is high,
they may not be desirable collateral. Specialized items, such as moon-roving vehi-
cles, are not desirable collateral either, because finding a buyer for them could be
difficult. When evaluating inventory as possible loan collateral, the lender looks
for items with very stable market prices that have ready markets and that lack
undesirable physical properties.
Floating Inventory Liens
A lender may be willing to secure a loan under a floating inventory lien, which is
a claim on inventory in general. This arrangement is most attractive when the
firm has a stable level of inventory that consists of a diversified group of relatively
inexpensive merchandise. Inventories of items such as auto tires, screws and
bolts, and shoes are candidates for floating-lien loans. Because it is difficult for a
lender to verify the presence of the inventory, the lender generally advances less
than 50 percent of the book value of the average inventory. The interest charge

floating inventory lien

against inventory under which

on a floating lien is 3 to 5 percent above the prime rate. Commercial banks often
require floating liens as extra security on what would otherwise be an unsecured
loan. Floating-lien inventory loans may also be available from commercial
finance companies.
Trust Receipt Inventory Loans
A trust receipt inventory loan often can be made against relatively expensive
automotive, consumer durable, and industrial goods that can be identified by
serial number. Under this agreement, the borrower keeps the inventory, and the
lender may advance 80 to 100 percent of its cost. The lender files a lien on all the
items financed. The borrower is free to sell the merchandise but is trusted to remit
the amount lent, along with accrued interest, to the lender immediately after the
sale. The lender then releases the lien on the item. The lender makes periodic
checks of the borrower’s inventory to make sure that the required collateral
remains in the hands of the borrower. The interest charge to the borrower is nor-
mally 2 percent or more above the prime rate.
Trust receipt loans are often made by manufacturers’ wholly owned
financing subsidiaries, known as captive finance companies, to their customers.
Captive finance companies are especially popular in industries that manufacture
consumer durable goods because they provide the manufacturer with a useful
sales tool. For example, General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC), the
financing subsidiary of General Motors, grants these types of loans to its dealers.
Trust receipt loans are also available through commercial banks and commercial
finance companies.
Warehouse Receipt Loans
A warehouse receipt loan is an arrangement whereby the lender, which may be a
commercial bank or finance company, receives control of the pledged inventory
collateral, which is stored by a designated agent on the lender’s behalf. After
selecting acceptable collateral, the lender hires a warehousing company to act as
its agent and take possession of the inventory.
Two types of warehousing arrangements are possible. A terminal warehouse
is a central warehouse that is used to store the merchandise of various customers.
The lender normally uses such a warehouse when the inventory is easily trans-
ported and can be delivered to the warehouse relatively inexpensively. Under a
field warehouse arrangement, the lender hires a field-warehousing company to
set up a warehouse on the borrower’s premises or to lease part of the borrower’s
warehouse to store the pledged collateral. Regardless of the type of warehouse,
the warehousing company places a guard over the inventory. Only on written
approval of the lender can any portion of the secured inventory be released by the
warehousing company.
The actual lending agreement specifically states the requirements for the
release of inventory. As with other secured loans, the lender accepts only collateral
that it believes to be readily marketable and advances only a portion—generally
75 to 90 percent—of the collateral’s value. The specific costs of warehouse
receipt loans are generally higher than those of any other secured lending
arrangements because of the need to hire and pay a warehousing company to
guard and supervise the collateral. The basic interest charged on warehouse
receipt loans is higher than that charged on unsecured loans, generally ranging

merchandise.

PART 7
Short-Term Financial Decisions
Summary
FOCUS ON VALUE
Current liabilities represent an important and generally inexpensive source of
financing for a firm. The level of short-term (current liabilities) financing
employed by a firm affects its profitability and risk. Accounts payable and
accruals are spontaneous liabilities that should be carefully managed because they
represent free financing. Notes payable, which represent negotiated short-term
financing, should be obtained at the lowest cost under the best possible terms.
Large, well-known firms can obtain unsecured short-term financing through the
sale of commercial paper. On a secured basis, the firm can obtain loans from
banks or commercial finance companies, using either accounts receivable or
inventory as collateral.
The financial manager must obtain the right quantity and form of current
liabilities financing to provide the lowest-cost funds with the least risk. Such a
strategy should positively contribute to the firm’s goal of maximizing the stock
price.
REVIEW OF LEARNING GOALS
Review accounts payable, the key components of credit terms, and the
procedures for analyzing those terms. The major spontaneous source of short-
term financing is accounts payable. They are the primary source of short-term
LG 1

funds. Credit terms may differ with respect to the credit period, cash discount,
cash discount period, and beginning of the credit period. Cash discounts should
be given up only when a firm in need of short-term funds must pay an 
interest rate on borrowing that is greater than the cost of giving up the cash 
discount.
Understand the effects of stretching accounts payable on their cost and
the use of accruals. Stretching accounts payable can lower the cost of giving up
a cash discount. Accruals, which result primarily from wage and tax obligations,
are virtually free.
Describe interest rates and the basic types of unsecured bank sources of
short-term loans. Banks are the major source of unsecured short-term loans to
businesses. The interest rate on these loans is tied to the prime rate of interest by
a risk premium and may be fixed or floating. It should be evaluated by using the
effective annual rate. Whether interest is paid when the loan matures or in
advance affects the rate. Bank loans may take the form of a single-payment
note, a line of credit, or a revolving credit agreement.
Discuss the basic features of commercial paper and the key aspects of
international short-term loans. Commercial paper is an unsecured IOU issued by
firms with a high credit standing. International sales and purchases expose firms
to exchange rate risk. Such transactions are larger and of longer maturity than
domestic transactions, and they can be financed by using a letter of credit, by
borrowing in the local market, or through dollar-denominated loans from inter-
national banks. On transactions between subsidiaries, “netting” can be used to
minimize foreign exchange fees and other transaction costs.
Explain the characteristics of secured short-term loans and the use of
accounts receivable as short-term-loan collateral. Secured short-term loans are
those for which the lender requires collateral—typically, current assets such as
accounts receivable or inventory. Only a percentage of the book value of accept-
able collateral is advanced by the lender. These loans are more expensive than
unsecured loans. Commercial banks and commercial finance companies make
secured short-term loans. Both pledging and factoring involve the use of accounts
receivable to obtain needed short-term funds.
Describe the various ways in which inventory can be used as short-term-
loan collateral. Inventory can be used as short-term-loan collateral under a
floating lien, a trust receipt arrangement, or a warehouse receipt loan.

Unsecured sources of short-term loans
John Savage has obtained a short-term loan
from First Carolina Bank. The loan matures in 180 days and is in the amount of
$45,000. John needs the money to cover start-up costs in a new business. He hopes
to have sufficient backing from other investors by the end of the next 6 months.
First Carolina Bank offers John two financing options for the $45,000 loan: a fixed-
rate loan at 2.5% above prime rate, or a variable-rate loan at 1.5% above prime.
Currently, the prime rate of interest is 6.5%, and the consensus forecasts of a
group of mortgage economists for changes in the prime rate over the next 180 days
are as follows: Sixty days from today the prime rate will rise by 0.5%; 90 days from
today the prime rate will rise another 1%; 180 days from today the prime rate will
drop by 0.5%.
Using the forecast prime rate changes, answer the following questions.
a. Calculate the total interest cost over 180 days for a fixed-rate loan.

be reduced to zero for a 30-day period. For an equivalent revolving credit agree-
ment, the rate is 2.80% over prime with a commitment fee of 0.50% on the average
unused balance. With both loans, the required compensating balance is equal to 
20% of the amount borrowed. (Note: Cumberland currently maintains $0 on deposit

Inventory financing
Raymond Manufacturing faces a liquidity crisis—it needs a
loan of $100,000 for 1 month. Having no source of additional unsecured bor-
rowing, the firm must find a secured short-term lender. The firm’s accounts receiv-
able are quite low, but its inventory is considered liquid and reasonably good
collateral. The book value of the inventory is $300,000, of which $120,000 is fin-
ished goods. (Note: Assume a 365-day year.)
(1) City-Wide Bank will make a $100,000 trust receipt loan against the finished
goods inventory. The annual interest rate on the loan is 12% on the outstanding
loan balance plus a 0.25% administration fee levied against the $100,000 initial
loan amount. Because it will be liquidated as inventory is sold, the average
amount owed over the month is expected to be $75,000.
(2) Sun State Bank will lend $100,000 against a floating lien on the book value of
inventory for the 1-month period at an annual interest rate of 13%.
(3) Citizens’ Bank and Trust will lend $100,000 against a warehouse receipt on the
finished goods inventory and charge 15% annual interest on the outstanding
loan balance. A 0.5% warehousing fee will be levied against the average amount
borrowed. Because the loan will be liquidated as inventory is sold, the average
loan balance is expected to be $60,000.
a. Calculate the dollar cost of each of the proposed plans for obtaining an initial loan
amount of $100,000.

Spreadsheet Exercise
Your company is considering manufacturing carrying cases for the portable video
game machines that are currently popular. Management decides to borrow $200,000
from each of two banks—First American and First Citizen. On the day that you visit
both banks, the quoted prime interest rate is 7%. Each loan is similar in that each
involves a 60-day note, with interest to be paid at the end of 60 days.
The interest rate was set at 2% above the prime rate on First American’s fixed-
rate note. Over the 60-day period, the rate of interest on this note will remain at the
2% premium over the prime rate regardless of fluctuations in the prime rate.
First Citizen sets its interest rate at 1.5% above the prime rate on its floating-rate
note. The rate charged over the 60 days will vary directly with the prime rate.
TO DO
First, create a spreadsheet to calculate the following for the First American loan:
a. Calculate the total dollar interest cost on the loan. Assume a 365-day year.
b. Calculate the 60-day rate on the loan.
c. Assume that the loan is rolled over each 60 days throughout the year under iden-
tical conditions and terms. Calculate the effective annual rate of interest on the
fixed-rate, 60-day First American note.
Next, create a spreadsheet to calculate the following for the First Citizen loan:
d. Calculate the initial interest rate.
e. If the prime rate immediately jumps to 7.5%, and after 30 days it drops to
7.25%, calculate the interest rate for the first 30 days and the second 30 days of
the loan.
f.

Casa de Diseño
I
n January 2012, Teresa Leal was named treasurer of Casa de Diseño. She decided
that she could best orient herself by systematically examining each area of the
company’s financial operations. She began by studying the firm’s short-term finan-
cial activities.
Casa de Diseño is located in Southern California and specializes in a furniture
line called “Ligne Moderna.” Of high quality and contemporary design, the furni-
ture appeals to the customer who wants something unique for his or her home or
apartment. Most Ligne Moderna furniture is built by special order because a wide
variety of upholstery, accent trimming, and colors is available. The product line is
distributed through exclusive dealership arrangements with well-established retail
stores. Casa de Diseño’s manufacturing process virtually eliminates the use of wood.
Plastic and metal provide the basic framework, and wood is used only for decorative
purposes.
Casa de Diseño entered the plastic-furniture market in late 2004. The company
markets its plastic-furniture products as indoor–outdoor items under the brand
name “Futuro.” Futuro plastic furniture emphasizes comfort, durability, and practi-
cality and is distributed through wholesalers. The Futuro line has been very suc-
cessful, accounting for nearly 40 percent of the firm’s sales and profits in 2011. Casa
de Diseño anticipates some additions to the Futuro line and also some limited
change of direction in its promotion in an effort to expand the applications of the
plastic furniture.
Leal has decided to study the firm’s cash management practices. To determine
the effects of these practices, she must first determine the current operating and cash
conversion cycles. In her investigations, she found that Casa de Diseño purchases all
of its raw materials and production supplies on open account. The company is oper-
ating at production levels that preclude volume discounts. Most suppliers do not
offer cash discounts, and Casa de Diseño usually receives credit terms of net 30. An
analysis of Casa de Diseño’s accounts payable showed that its average payment
period is 30 days. Leal consulted industry data and found that the industry average
payment period was 39 days. Investigation of six California furniture manufacturers
revealed that their average payment period was also 39 days.
Next, Leal studied the production cycle and inventory policies. Casa de Diseño
tries not to hold any more inventory than necessary in either raw materials or fin-
ished goods. The average inventory age was 110 days. Leal determined that the
industry standard, as reported in a survey done by Furniture Age, the trade associa-
tion journal, was 83 days.
Casa de Diseño sells to all of its customers on a net-60 basis, in line with the
industry trend to grant such credit terms on specialty furniture. Leal discovered, by
aging the accounts receivable, that the average collection period for the firm was 75
days. Investigation of the trade association’s and California manufacturers’ averages
showed that the same collection period existed where net-60 credit terms were given.
Where cash discounts were offered, the collection period was significantly shortened.
Leal believed that if Casa de Diseño were to offer credit terms of 3/10 net 60, the
average collection period could be reduced by 40 percent.

673
Casa de Diseño was spending an estimated $26,500,000 per year on operating-
cycle investments. Leal considered this expenditure level to be the minimum she
could expect the firm to disburse during 2012. Her concern was whether the firm’s
cash management was as efficient as it could be. She knew that the company paid 
15 percent annual interest for its resource investment. For this reason, she was con-
cerned about the financing cost resulting from any inefficiencies in the management
of Casa de Diseño’s cash conversion cycle. (Note: Assume a 365-day year and that
the operating-cycle investment per dollar of payables, inventory, and receivables is
the same.)
TO DO
a. Assuming a constant rate for purchases, production, and sales throughout the
year, what are Casa de Diseño’s existing operating cycle (OC), cash conversion
cycle (CCC), and resource investment need?
b. If Leal can optimize Casa de Diseño’s operations according to industry standards,
what will Casa de Diseño’s operating cycle (OC), cash conversion cycle (CCC),
and resource investment need to be under these more efficient conditions?
c. In terms of resource investment requirements, what is the cost of Casa de
Diseño’s operational inefficiency?
d. (1) If in addition to achieving industry standards for payables and inventory, the
firm can reduce the average collection period by offering credit terms of 3/10
net 60, what additional savings in resource investment costs will result from
the shortened cash conversion cycle, assuming that the level of sales remains
constant?
(2) If the firm’s sales (all on credit) are $40,000,000 and 45% of the customers
are expected to take the cash discount, by how much will the firm’s annual
revenues be reduced as a result of the discount?
(3) If the firm’s variable cost of the $40,000,000 in sales is 80%, determine the
reduction in the average investment in accounts receivable and the annual
savings that will result from this reduced investment, assuming that sales
remain constant.
(4) If the firm’s bad-debts expenses decline from 2% to 1.5% of sales, what
annual savings will result, assuming that sales remain constant?
(5) Use your findings in parts (2) through (4) to assess whether offering the cash
discount can be justified financially. Explain why or why not.
e. On the basis of your analysis in parts a through d, what recommendations would
you offer Teresa Leal?
f.
Review for Teresa Leal the key sources of short-term financing, other than
accounts payable, that she may consider for financing Casa de Diseño’s resource
investment need calculated in part b. Be sure to mention both unsecured and
secured sources.

t has become a cliché to say that business is becoming more complex and more
global over time, but, like all clichés, there is a ring of truth in that statement. In this
final part, we examine three special topics that are among the most challenging and
exciting topics in all of finance.
Chapter 17 introduces hybrid and derivative securities. A hybrid is a security that has
characteristics similar to other securities. For example, preferred stock is a hybrid because
it has some debt-like and some equity-like features. Just as many bonds pay a fixed
interest rate, preferred stock pays a fixed dividend. However, preferred stock is more like
equity in that investors who hold preferred shares cannot force a firm into bankruptcy if it
stops paying preferred dividends. A derivative is a security that derives its value from
some other security. For example, a call option is a derivative because its value increases
(decreases) if the stock price increases (decreases). Perhaps surprisingly, investors can use
derivatives to either speculate on price changes in the stock market or to protect
themselves against such movements.
Chapter 18 focuses on mergers, leveraged buyouts, and bankruptcy. These are three of the
biggest “events” that can happen in the life of a corporation, and certainly most large
companies acquire other companies from time to time. Chapter 18 explains the techniques
that firms use to execute various types of mergers and acquisitions and highlights the
motivations behind those transactions. The chapter also discusses a significant event that
firms generally want to avoid—business failure. We discuss the different types and causes
of business failures as well as several mechanisms that are used to resolve these failures.
Chapter 19 emphasizes global dimensions of financial management, starting with an
overview of trading blocs and other international institutions that have a significant
impact on multinational businesses. The chapter offers in-depth coverage of the financial
risks associated with doing business internationally, especially risks related to movements
in exchange rates, and the techniques that firms use to manage those risks. Finally,
Chapter 19 provides a glimpse into the wide range of options available to
multinational firms for raising money in markets around the world.

Why This Chapter Matters to You
In your professional life
ACCOUNTING You need to understand the types of leasing arrange-
ments and the general features of convertible securities, stock purchase
warrants, and options, which you will be required to record and
report.
INFORMATION SYSTEMS You need to understand types of leasing
arrangements and of convertible securities to design systems that will
track data used to make lease-or-purchase and conversion decisions.
MANAGEMENT You need to understand when and why it may make
better sense to lease assets rather than to purchase them. You need to
understand how convertible securities and stock purchase warrants
work to decide when the firm would benefit from their use. You also
need to understand the impact of call and put options on the firm.
MARKETING You need to understand leasing as a way to finance a
new project proposal. You also should understand how hybrid securi-
ties can be used to raise funds for new projects.
OPERATIONS You need to understand the role of leasing in financing
new equipment. You also need to understand the maintenance obliga-
tions associated with leased equipment.
Understanding hybrid and deriva-
tive securities will benefit you in
your investment activities. Even more useful is an understanding of
leasing, which you may use to finance certain long-lived assets such as
housing or cars. Knowing how to analyze and compare leasing to the
alternative of purchasing should help you to better manage your per-
sonal finances.

”We’ll Buy It, You Fly It”
O
n July 21, 2010, the Irish aircraft leasing com-
pany, Avolon, announced that it had signed a
deal to purchase 12 next-generation Boeing 737-800
airplanes. The 737-800 aircraft was designed to be
more fuel efficient than its predecessors and had a list
price of $80 million. Avolon CEO, Dómhnal Slattery,
said his company would be seeking more than $1 bil-
lion in new equity capital to fund its ongoing growth.
Avolon’s business model did not call for it to fly airplanes but rather to lease them to air-
lines in transactions known as sale-leasebacks. In a sale-leaseback, the airline agrees to lease
an airplane from Avolon for 8 to 10 years. At the end of that period, the airline may have the
option to purchase the airplane, or ownership may revert to the leasing company.
Aircraft are just one example of equipment that is leased. Other commonly leased equip-
ment includes computers, oil-drilling equipment, railway cars, cable television, medical equip-
ment, pollution-control devices, and solar energy devices. Most leased equipment is expensive
and would require large cash outlays if purchased outright. Leasing provides an easier method
of obtaining an up-to-date piece of equipment with a much smaller cash outlay.
Leasing is a tool that 80 percent of U.S. businesses have used at some time to acquire
equipment. By leasing a large piece of equipment, the lessee can improve cash flow, keep
pace with technology by leasing the latest models, and sometimes improve the company’s finan-
cial ratios by excluding some leased assets (operating leases) from the balance sheet.
In this chapter, we’ll demonstrate how to analyze lease financing, a hybrid financing tech-
nique that incorporates elements of debt and equity. You will also learn about other hybrids
including convertible securities, stock purchase warrants, and derivative securities such as stock
options.

17.1 Overview of Hybrids and Derivatives
Chapters 6 and 7 described the characteristics of the key securities—corporate
bonds, common stock, and preferred stock—used by corporations to raise long-
term funds. In their simplest form, bonds are pure debt and common stock is pure
equity. Preferred stock, on the other hand, is a form of equity that promises to
pay fixed periodic dividends that are similar to the fixed contractual interest pay-
ments on bonds. Because it blends the characteristics of both debt (a fixed divi-
dend payment) and equity (ownership), preferred stock is considered a hybrid
security. Other popular hybrid securities include financial leases, convertible
securities, and stock purchase warrants. Each of these hybrid securities is
described in the following pages.
The final section of this chapter focuses on options, a popular derivative
security—a security that is neither debt nor equity but derives its value from an
underlying asset that is often another security. As you’ll learn, derivatives are not
used by corporations to raise funds but rather serve as a useful tool for managing
certain aspects of the firm’s risk.

17.2 Leasing
Leasing enables the firm to obtain the use of certain fixed assets for which it must
make a series of contractual, periodic, tax-deductible payments. The lessee is the
receiver of the services of the assets under the lease contract; the lessor is the
owner of the assets. Leasing can take a number of forms.
TYPES OF LEASES
The two basic types of leases that are available to a business are operating leases
and financial leases (often called capital leases by accountants).
Operating Leases
An operating lease is normally a contractual arrangement whereby the lessee
agrees to make periodic payments to the lessor, often for 5 or fewer years, to
obtain an asset’s services. Such leases are generally cancelable at the option of the
lessee, who may be required to pay a penalty for cancellation. Assets that are
leased under operating leases have a usable life that is longer than the term of the
lease. Usually, however, they would become less efficient and technologically
obsolete if leased for a longer period. Computer systems are prime examples of
assets whose relative efficiency is expected to diminish as the technology changes.
The operating lease is therefore a common arrangement for obtaining such sys-
tems, as well as for other relatively short-lived assets such as automobiles.
If an operating lease is held to maturity, the lessee at that time returns the
leased asset to the lessor, who may lease it again or sell the asset. Normally, the
asset still has a positive market value at the termination of the lease. In some

leased asset.

instances, the lease contract gives the lessee the opportunity to purchase the
leased asset. Generally, the total payments made by the lessee to the lessor are less
than the lessor’s initial cost of the leased asset.
Financial (or Capital) Leases
A financial (or capital) lease is a longer-term lease than an operating lease.
Financial leases are noncancelable and obligate the lessee to make payments for
the use of an asset over a predefined period of time. Financial leases are com-
monly used for leasing land, buildings, and large pieces of equipment. The non-
cancelable feature of the financial lease makes it similar to certain types of
long-term debt. The lease payment becomes a fixed, tax-deductible expenditure
that must be paid at predefined dates. As with debt, failure to make the contrac-
tual lease payments can result in bankruptcy for the lessee.
With a financial lease, the total payments over the term of the lease are
greater than the lessor’s initial cost of the leased asset. In other words, the lessor
must receive more than the asset’s purchase price to earn its required return on
the investment. Technically, under FASB (Financial Accounting Standards Board)
Statement No. 13, “Accounting for Leases,” a financial (or capital) lease is
defined as one that has any of the following elements:
1. The lease transfers ownership of the property to the lessee by the end of the
lease term.
2. The lease contains an option to purchase the property at a “bargain price.”
Such an option must be exercisable at a “fair market value.”
3. The lease term is equal to 75 percent or more of the estimated economic life
of the property (exceptions exist for property leased toward the end of its
usable economic life).
4. At the beginning of the lease, the present value of the lease payments is equal
to 90 percent or more of the fair market value of the leased property.
The emphasis in this chapter is on financial leases, because they result in
inescapable long-term financial commitments by the firm.
The Focus on Practice box on page 680 discusses leasing by Disney that did
not have a happy ending.
LEASING ARRANGEMENTS
Lessors use three primary techniques for obtaining assets to be leased. The
method depends largely on the desires of the prospective lessee.
1. A direct lease results when a lessor owns or acquires the assets that are leased
to a given lessee. In other words, the lessee did not previously own the assets
that it is leasing.
2. In a sale-leaseback arrangement, lessors acquire leased assets by purchasing
assets already owned by the lessee and leasing them back. This technique is
normally initiated by a firm that needs funds for operations. By selling an
existing asset to a lessor and then leasing it back, the lessee receives cash for
the asset immediately, while obligating itself to make fixed periodic payments
for use of the leased asset.
3. Leasing arrangements that include one or more third-party lenders are
leveraged leases. Under a leveraged lease, the lessor acts as an equity participant,

supplying only about 20 percent of the cost of the asset, and a lender supplies
the balance. Leveraged leases are especially popular in structuring leases of
very expensive assets.
A lease agreement typically specifies whether the lessee is responsible for
maintenance of the leased assets. Operating leases normally include maintenance
clauses requiring the lessor to maintain the assets and to make insurance and tax
payments. Financial leases nearly always require the lessee to pay maintenance
and other costs.
The lessee is usually given the option to renew a lease at its expiration.
Renewal options, which grant lessees the right to re-lease assets at expiration, are
especially common in operating leases because their term is generally shorter than
the usable life of the leased assets. Purchase options allowing the lessee to pur-
chase the leased asset at maturity, typically for a prespecified price, are frequently
included in both operating and financial leases.
The lessor can be one of a number of parties. In operating leases, the lessor is
likely to be the manufacturer’s leasing subsidiary or an independent leasing com-
pany. Financial leases are frequently handled by independent leasing companies
or by the leasing subsidiaries of large financial institutions such as commercial
banks and life insurance companies. Life insurance companies are especially
active in real estate leasing. Pension funds, like commercial banks, have also been
increasing their leasing activities.

Leases to Airlines End on a Sour Note

the $114 million book value assigned
to its investment in two Boeing 747s
and two 767s leased to United.
Pursuing the matter in the courts, Disney
was able to recoup $50 million from
United for its lost tax benefits.
With additional aircraft leased out
to Delta Air Lines (five aircraft, $119
million), the Disney tale of leveraged
leases had not reached its final reel.
Delta Air Lines announced 7,000 jobs
cut in September 2004 as part of a
$5 billion cost-saving program and
entered bankruptcy in late 2005. At
that time Disney was forced to declare
a write-off of $68 million for its Delta
leases, and the company eventually left

lease, Disney put up 20 percent of the

under a loan using the plane as collat-

were put at risk.
During the 1990s, leveraged
leases were attractive investments that
boosted a company’s return on invest-
ment. However, the destruction of the
World Trade Center on September 11,
2001, and the ensuing reaction to
potential terrorist threats crippled air
travel and put U.S. air carriers under
tremendous financial pressure. The
result for United Airlines was bank-
ruptcy. Under bankruptcy protection,
United was able to break any lease it
didn’t want, giving the airline powerful
leverage to renegotiate lower lease
payments, at lower market rates. When
no deal was reached, United Airlines

LEASE-VERSUS-PURCHASE DECISION
Firms that are contemplating the acquisition of new fixed assets commonly con-
front the lease-versus-purchase (or lease-versus-buy) decision. The alternatives
available are (1) lease the assets, (2) borrow funds to purchase the assets, or 
(3) purchase the assets using available liquid resources. Alternatives 2 and 3,
although they differ, are analyzed in a similar fashion; even if the firm has the
liquid resources with which to purchase the assets, the use of these funds is
viewed as equivalent to borrowing. Therefore, we need to compare only the
leasing and purchasing alternatives.
The lease-versus-purchase decision involves application of the capital budg-
eting methods presented in Chapters 10 through 12. First, we determine the rele-
vant cash flows and then apply present value techniques. The following steps are
involved in the analysis:
Step 1
Find the after-tax cash outflows for each year under the lease alternative.
This step generally involves a fairly simple tax adjustment of the annual
lease payments. In addition, the cost of exercising a purchase option in
the final year of the lease term must frequently be included.1
Step 2
Find the after-tax cash outflows for each year under the purchase alter-
native. This step involves adjusting the sum of the scheduled loan pay-
ment and maintenance cost outlay for the tax shields resulting from the
tax deductions attributable to maintenance, depreciation, and interest.
Step 3
Calculate the present value of the cash outflows associated with the lease
(from Step 1) and purchase (from Step 2) alternatives using the after-tax
cost of debt as the discount rate. The after-tax cost of debt is used to
evaluate the lease-versus-purchase decision because the decision itself
involves the choice between two financing techniques—leasing and 
borrowing—that have very low risk.
Step 4
Choose the alternative with the lower present value of cash outflows
from Step 3. It will be the least-cost financing alternative.
The application of each of these steps is demonstrated in the following example.
Roberts Company, a small machine shop, is contemplating acquiring a new
machine that costs $24,000. Arrangements can be made to lease or purchase the
machine. The firm is in the 40% tax bracket.
Lease
The firm would obtain a 5-year lease requiring annual end-of-year lease
payments of $6,000. All maintenance costs would be paid by the lessor, and
insurance and other costs would be borne by the lessee. The lessee would exercise
its option to purchase the machine for $1,200 at termination of the lease.2
Example 17.1 3
CHAPTER 17
Hybrid and Derivative Securities
681
lease-versus-purchase (or
lease-versus-buy) decision
The decision facing firms
needing to acquire new fixed
assets: whether to lease the
assets or to purchase them,
using borrowed funds or
available liquid resources.
1. Including the cost of exercising a purchase option in the cash flows for the lease alternative ensures that under
both lease and purchase alternatives the firm owns the asset at the end of the relevant time horizon. The other
approach would be to include the cash flows from sale of the asset in the cash flows for the purchase alternative at
the end of the lease term. These strategies guarantee avoidance of unequal lives, which were discussed in Chapter 12.
In addition, they make any subsequent cash flows irrelevant because these would be either identical or nonexistent,
respectively, under each alternative.
2. Lease payments are generally made at the beginning of the year. To simplify the following discussions, end-of-year
lease payments are assumed. We are assuming that the machine’s market value and book value are both $1,200 at
the end of 5 years.

Purchase
The firm would finance the purchase of the machine with a 9%, 5-year
loan requiring end-of-year installment payments of $6,170.3 The machine would
be depreciated under MACRS using a 5-year recovery period. The firm would
pay $1,500 per year for a service contract that covers all maintenance costs;
insurance and other costs would be borne by the firm. The firm plans to keep the
machine and use it beyond its 5-year recovery period.
Using these data, we can apply the steps presented earlier:
Step 1
The after-tax cash outflow from the lease payments can be found by multi-
plying the before-tax payment of $6,000 by 1 minus the tax rate, T, of 40%.
Therefore, the lease alternative results in annual cash outflows over the
5-year lease of $3,600. In the final year, the $1,200 cost of the purchase
option would be added to the $3,600 lease outflow to get a total cash
outflow in year 5 of $4,800 ($3,600
$1,200).
Step 2
The after-tax cash outflow from the purchase alternative is a bit more dif-
ficult to find. First, the interest component of each annual loan payment
must be determined because the Internal Revenue Service allows the
deduction of interest only—not principal—from income for tax purposes.4
Table 17.1 presents the calculations necessary to split the loan payments
+
 = $6,000 * (1 - 0.40) = $3,600
 After-tax cash outflow from lease = $6,000 * (1 - T)

Special Topics in Managerial Finance
3. The annual loan payment on the 9 percent, 5-year loan of $24,000 is calculated by using the loan amortization
technique described in Chapter 5. To calculate the loan payment in Excel, you would use the “pmt” function,
entering into any blank cell, 
pmt(0.09,5,24000,0,0). In the terms inside the parenthesis, 0.09 is the interest rate, 
5 is the term of the lease in years, and 24,000 is the amount being borrowed (or equivalently, the cost of the new
machine). The final two zeros inside the parenthesis tell Excel that after 5 years the loan is totally paid off (zero
remaining balance) and that payments are made at the end of each year. The exact loan payment is $6,170.22, but
in the example we round down to the nearest dollar.
4. When the rate of interest on the loan used to finance the purchase just equals the cost of debt, the present value of the
after-tax loan payments (annual loan payments
interest tax shields) discounted at the after-tax cost of debt just equals
the initial loan principal. In such a case, it is unnecessary to amortize the loan to determine the payment amount and the
amounts of interest when finding after-tax cash outflows. The loan payments and interest payments (columns 1 and 4 in
Table 17.2) can be ignored, and, in their place, the initial loan principal ($24,000) is shown as an outflow occurring at
time zero. To allow for a loan interest rate that is different from the firm’s cost of debt and for easier understanding, here
we isolate the loan payments and interest payments rather than use this computationally more efficient approach.

into their interest and principal components. Columns 3 and 4 show the
annual interest and principal paid.
In Table 17.2, the annual loan payment is shown in column 1, and the annual
maintenance cost, which is a tax-deductible expense, is shown in column 2. Next,
we find the annual depreciation write-off resulting from the $24,000 machine.
Using the applicable MACRS 5-year recovery period depreciation percentages—
20% in year 1, 32% in year 2, 19% in year 3, and 12% in years 4 and 5—given
in Table 4.2 on page 117 results in the annual depreciation for years 1 through 5
given in column 3 of Table 17.2.5
Table 17.2 presents the calculations required to determine the cash outflows6
associated with borrowing to purchase the new machine. Column 7 of the table
presents the after-tax cash outflows associated with the purchase alternative. A
few points should be clarified with respect to the calculations in Table 17.2. The
major cash outflows are the total loan payment for each year given in column 1
and the annual maintenance cost in column 2. The sum of these two outflows is
reduced by the tax savings from writing off the maintenance, depreciation, and
interest expenses associated with the new machine and its financing. The
resulting cash outflows are the after-tax cash outflows associated with the pur-
chase alternative.
Step 3
The present values of the cash outflows associated with the lease (from
Step 1) and purchase (from Step 2) alternatives are calculated in Table 17.3
using the firm’s 6% after-tax cost of debt.7 The sum of the present values
of the cash outflows for the leasing alternative is given in column 2 of
Table 17.3, and the sum of those for the purchasing alternative is given in
column 4.

5. We are ignoring depreciation in year 6 because regardless of which option the company selects there will be
$1,200 worth of depreciation remaining.
6. Although other cash outflows such as insurance and operating expenses may be relevant here, they would be the
same under the lease and purchase alternatives and therefore would cancel out in the final analysis.
7. If we ignore any flotation costs, the firm’s after-tax cost of debt would be 5.4% [9% debt cost
(1

rate)]. To reflect both the flotation costs associated with selling new debt and the possible need to sell the debt at a
discount, we use an after-tax debt cost of 6% as the applicable discount rate. A more detailed discussion of tech-
niques for calculating the after-tax cost of debt is found in Chapter 9.

Step 4
Because the present value of cash outflows for leasing ($16,062) is lower
than that for purchasing ($19,541), the leasing alternative is preferred.
Leasing results in an incremental savings of $3,479 ($19,541
$16,062)
and is therefore the less costly alternative.
The techniques described here for comparing lease and purchase alterna-
tives may be applied in different ways. The approach illustrated by the Roberts
Company data is one of the most straightforward. It is important to recognize
that the lower cost of one alternative over the other results from factors such as
the differing tax brackets of the lessor and lessee, different tax treatments of
leases versus purchases, and differing risks and borrowing costs for lessor and
lessee. Therefore, when making a lease-versus-purchase decision, the firm will
find that inexpensive borrowing opportunities, high required lessor returns,
and a low risk of obsolescence increase the attractiveness of purchasing.
Subjective factors must also be included in the decision-making process. Like
most financial decisions, the lease-versus-purchase decision requires some judg-
ment or intuition.
Jake Jiminez is considering either leasing or purchasing a new
Honda Fit that will cost $15,000. The 3-year lease requires an
initial payment of $1,800 and monthly payments of $300. Purchasing requires a
$2,500 down payment, sales tax of 5% ($750), and 36 monthly payments of
$392. He estimates the trade-in value of the new car will be $8,000 at the end of
3 years. Assuming Jake can earn 4% annual interest on his savings and is subject
to a 5% sales tax on purchases, we can make a reasonable recommendation to
Jake using the following analysis (for simplicity, ignoring the time value of
money).

EFFECTS OF LEASING ON FUTURE FINANCING
Because leasing is considered a type of financing, it affects the firm’s future
financing, just as having existing debt has an impact on a firm’s ability to borrow
even more. Lease payments are shown as a tax-deductible expense on the firm’s
income statement. Anyone analyzing the firm’s income statement would probably
recognize that an asset is being leased, although the amount and term of the lease
would be unclear.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), in FASB Statement No.
13, “Accounting for Leases,” requires explicit disclosure of financial (capital)
lease obligations on the firm’s balance sheet. Such a lease must be shown as a
capitalized lease, meaning that the present value of all its payments is included as
an asset and corresponding liability on the firm’s balance sheet. An operating
lease, on the other hand, need not be capitalized, but its basic features must be dis-
closed in a footnote to the financial statements. FASB Statement No. 13, of course,
establishes detailed guidelines to be used in capitalizing leases. Subsequent stan-
dards have further refined lease capitalization and disclosure procedures.
Jeffrey Company, a manufacturer of water purifiers, is leasing an asset under a
10-year lease requiring annual end-of-year payments of $15,000. The lease can
be capitalized merely by calculating the present value of the lease payments over
the life of the lease. However, the rate at which the payments should be dis-
counted is difficult to determine.8 If 10% were used, the present, or capitalized,
value of the lease would be $92,169. This value would be shown as an asset and

8. The Financial Accounting Standards Board in Statement No. 13 established certain guidelines for the appropriate
discount rate to use when capitalizing leases. Most commonly, the rate that the lessee would have incurred to
borrow the funds to buy the asset with a secured loan under terms similar to the lease repayment schedule is used.
This simply represents the before-tax cost of a secured debt.

corresponding liability on the firm’s balance sheet, which should result in an
accurate reflection of the firm’s true financial position.
Because the consequences of missing a financial lease payment are the same
as those of missing an interest or principal payment on debt, a financial analyst
must view the lease as a long-term financial commitment of the lessee. With FASB
Statement No. 13, the inclusion of each financial (capital) lease as an asset and
corresponding liability (that is, long-term debt) provides for a balance sheet that
more accurately reflects the firm’s financial status. It thereby permits various
types of financial ratio analyses to be performed directly on the statement by any
interested party.
ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF LEASING
Leasing has a number of commonly cited advantages and disadvantages that
managers should consider when making a lease-versus-purchase decision. It is not
unusual for a number of them to apply in a given situation. Table 17.4 describes
the commonly cited advantages and disadvantages of leasing.

Special Topics in Managerial Finance
Advantages and Disadvantages of Leasing
Advantages
TABLE 17.4
• The firm may avoid the cost of obsolescence. This is espe-
cially true in the case of operating leases, which generally
have relatively short lives.
• A lessee avoids many of the restrictive covenants (such as
minimum liquidity, subsequent borrowing, and cash divi-
dend payments) that are normally included as part of a long-
term loan but are not normally found in a lease agreement.
• In the case of low-cost assets that are infrequently acquired,
leasing—especially operating leases—may provide the firm
with needed financing flexibility. The firm does not have to
arrange other financing for these assets.
• Sale-leaseback arrangements may permit the firm to increase
its liquidity by converting an existing asset into cash. This
can benefit a firm that is short of working capital or in a 
liquidity bind.
• Leasing allows the lessee, in effect, to depreciate land, which
would be prohibited if the land were purchased. Because the
lessee who leases land is permitted to deduct the total lease
payment as an expense for tax purposes, the effect is the
same as if the firm had purchased the land and then depreci-
ated it.
• Because leasing may not increase the assets or liabilities on
the firm’s balance sheet, leasing may result in misleading
financial ratios. Understating assets and liabilities can cause
certain ratios, such as the total asset turnover, to look better
than they might be. With the adoption of FASB Statement
No. 13, this advantage no longer applies to financial leases,
although it remains a potential advantage for operating
leases.
• Leasing provides 100 percent financing. Most loan agree-
ments for the purchase of fixed assets require a down pay-
ment; thus the borrower is able to borrow only 90 to 95
percent of the purchase price of the asset.
• In the case of bankruptcy or reorganization, the maximum
claim of lessors against the corporation is 3 years of lease
payments. If debt is used to purchase an asset, the creditors
have a claim that is equal to the total outstanding loan 
balance.
• In many leases the return to the lessor is quite high;
the firm might be better off borrowing to purchase 
the asset.
• The terminal value of an asset, if any, is realized by the
lessor. If the lessee had purchased the asset, it could have
claimed its terminal value. Of course, an expected terminal
value when recognized by the lessor results in lower lease
payments.
• The lessee is generally prohibited from making improve-
ments on the leased property or asset without the lessor’s
approval. However, lessors generally encourage leasehold
improvements when these are expected to enhance the
asset’s salvage value.
• If a lessee leases an asset that subsequently becomes obso-
lete, it still must make lease payments over the remaining
term of the lease. This is true even if the asset is unusable.

17.3 Convertible Securities
A conversion feature is an option that is included as part of a bond or a preferred
stock issue and allows its holder to change the security into a stated number of
shares of common stock. The conversion feature typically enhances the mar-
ketability of an issue.
TYPES OF CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES
Corporate bonds and preferred stocks may be convertible into common stock.
The most common type of convertible security is the bond. Convertibles nor-
mally have an accompanying call feature, which permits the issuer to retire or
encourage conversion of outstanding convertibles when appropriate.
Convertible Bonds
A convertible bond can be changed into a specified number of shares of common
stock. It is nearly always a debenture—an unsecured bond—with a call feature.
Because the conversion feature provides the purchaser with the possibility of
becoming a stockholder on favorable terms, convertible bonds are generally a less
expensive form of financing than similar-risk nonconvertible or straight bonds.
The conversion feature adds a degree of speculation to a bond issue, although the
issue still maintains its value as a bond.
Convertible Preferred Stock
Convertible preferred stock is preferred stock that can be changed into a specified
number of shares of common stock. It can normally be sold with a lower stated
dividend than a similar-risk nonconvertible or straight preferred stock. The
reason is that the convertible preferred holder is assured of the fixed dividend
payment associated with a preferred stock and also may receive the appreciation
resulting from increases in the market price of the underlying common stock.
Convertible preferred stock behaves much like convertible bonds. The following
discussions will concentrate on the more widespread convertible bonds.

GENERAL FEATURES OF CONVERTIBLES
Convertible securities are nearly always convertible at any time during the life of
the security. Occasionally, conversion is permitted only for a limited number of
years—say, for 5 or 10 years after issuance of the convertible.
Conversion Ratio
The conversion ratio is the ratio at which a convertible security can be exchanged
for common stock. The conversion ratio can be stated in two ways:
1. Sometimes the conversion ratio is stated in terms of a given number of shares
of common stock. To find the conversion price, which is the per-share price
that is effectively paid for common stock as the result of conversion, divide
the par value (not the market value) of the convertible security by the con-
version ratio.
Western Wear Company, a manufacturer of denim products, has outstanding a
bond that has a $1,000 par value and is convertible into 25 shares of common
stock. The bond’s conversion ratio is 25. The conversion price for the bond is $40
per share ($1,000
25).
2. Sometimes, instead of the conversion ratio, the conversion price is given. The
conversion ratio can be obtained by dividing the par value of the convertible
by the conversion price.
Mosher Company, a franchiser of seafood restaurants, has outstanding a con-
vertible 20-year bond with a par value of $1,000. The bond is convertible at $50
per share into common stock. The conversion ratio is 20 ($1,000
$50).
The issuer of a convertible security normally establishes a conversion ratio or
conversion price that sets the conversion price per share at the time of issuance
above the current market price of the firm’s stock. If the prospective purchasers
do not expect conversion ever to be feasible, they will purchase a straight security
or some other convertible issue.
Conversion (or Stock) Value
The conversion (or stock) value is the value of the convertible measured in terms
of the market price of the common stock into which it can be converted. The con-
version value can be found simply by multiplying the conversion ratio by the cur-
rent market price of the firm’s common stock.

Matter of fact
I
n the first quarter of 2010, firms issued roughly $6 billion in convertible securities in the United
States. However, with the historically low interest rates prevailing at that time, many companies
decided to refinance some of their outstanding debts, so more convertibles were retired than
issued, resulting in a net decline in the size of the overall market for convertibles.

conversion (or stock) value
The value of a convertible

common stock into which it can

McNamara Industries, a petroleum processor, has outstanding a $1,000 bond
that is convertible into common stock at $62.50 per share. The conversion ratio
is therefore 16 ($1,000
$62.50). Because the current market price of the
common stock is $65 per share, the conversion value is $1,040 (16
$65).
Because the conversion value is above the bond value of $1,000, conversion is a
viable option for the owner of the convertible security.
Effect on Earnings per Share
The presence of contingent securities, which include convertibles as well as war-
rants and stock options (described later in this chapter), affects the reporting of
the firm’s earnings per share (EPS). Firms with contingent securities, which if con-
verted or exercised would dilute (that is, lower) earnings per share, are required
to report earnings in two ways—basic EPS and diluted EPS.
Basic EPS are calculated without regard to any contingent securities. They
are found by dividing earnings available for common stockholders by the number
of shares of common stock outstanding. We use this standard method of calcu-
lating EPS throughout this textbook.
Diluted EPS are calculated under the assumption that all contingent securities
that would have dilutive effects are converted and exercised and are therefore
common stock. They are found by adjusting basic EPS for the impact of con-
verting all convertibles and exercising all warrants and options that would have
dilutive effects on the firm’s earnings. This approach treats as common stock all
contingent securities. It is calculated by dividing earnings available for common
stockholders (adjusted for interest and preferred stock dividends that would not
be paid, given assumed conversion of all outstanding contingent securities that
would have dilutive effects) by the number of shares of common stock that would
be outstanding if all contingent securities that would have dilutive effects were
converted and exercised. Rather than demonstrate these accounting calculations,9
suffice it to say that firms with outstanding convertibles, warrants, and/or stock
options must report basic and diluted EPS on their income statements.
FINANCING WITH CONVERTIBLES
Using convertible securities to raise long-term funds can help the firm achieve its
cost-of-capital and capital structure goals. There also are a number of more spe-
cific motives and considerations involved in evaluating convertible financing.
Motives for Convertible Financing
Convertibles can be used for a variety of reasons. One popular motive is their use
as a form of deferred common stock financing. When a convertible security is
issued, both issuer and purchaser expect the security to be converted into
common stock at some future point. Because the security is first sold with a con-
version price above the current market price of the firm’s stock, conversion is ini-
tially not attractive. The issuer of a convertible could alternatively sell common

9. For excellent discussions and demonstrations of the two methods of reporting EPS, see Donald A. Kieso, Jerry J.
Weygandt, and Terry D. Warfield, Intermediate Accounting, 12th ed. (New York: John Wiley, 2007), pp. 792–805,
812–816.

stock, but only at or below its current market price. By selling the convertible,
the issuer in effect makes a deferred sale of common stock. As the market price
of the firm’s common stock rises to a higher level, conversion may occur.
Deferring the issuance of new common stock until the market price of the stock
has increased means that fewer shares will have to be issued, thereby decreasing
the dilution of both ownership and earnings.
Another motive for convertible financing is its use as a “sweetener” for
financing. Because the purchaser of the convertible is given the opportunity to
become a common stockholder and share in the firm’s future success, convertibles
can be normally sold with lower interest rates than nonconvertibles. Therefore, from
the firm’s viewpoint, including a conversion feature reduces the interest cost of debt.
The purchaser of the issue sacrifices a portion of interest return for the potential
opportunity to become a common stockholder. Another important motive for
issuing convertibles is that, generally speaking, convertible securities can be issued
with far fewer restrictive covenants than nonconvertibles. Because many investors
view convertibles as equity, the covenant issue is not as important to them.
A final motive for using convertibles is to raise cheap funds temporarily. By
using convertible bonds, the firm can temporarily raise debt, which is typically
less expensive than common stock, to finance projects. Once such projects are
under way, the firm may wish to shift its capital structure to a less highly lever-
aged position. A conversion feature gives the issuer the opportunity, through
actions of convertible holders, to shift its capital structure at a future time.
Other Considerations
When the price of the firm’s common stock rises above the conversion price, the
market price of the convertible security will normally rise to a level close to its
conversion value. When this happens, many convertible holders will not convert
because they already have the market price benefit obtainable from conversion
and can still receive fixed periodic interest payments. Because of this behavior,
virtually all convertible securities have a call feature that enables the issuer to
encourage or “force” conversion. The call price of the security generally exceeds
the security’s par value by an amount equal to 1 year’s stated interest on the secu-
rity. Although the issuer must pay a premium for calling a security, the call privi-
lege is generally not exercised until the conversion value of the security is 10 to 15
percent above the call price. This type of premium above the call price helps to
assure the issuer that the holders of the convertible will convert it when the call is
made, instead of accepting the call price.
Unfortunately, there are instances when the market price of a security does
not reach a level sufficient to stimulate the conversion of associated convert-
ibles. A convertible security that cannot be forced into conversion by using the
call feature is called an overhanging issue. An overhanging issue can be quite
detrimental to a firm. If the firm were to call the issue, the bondholders would
accept the call price rather than convert the bonds. In this case, the firm not
only would have to pay the call premium but would also require additional
financing to pay off the bonds at their par value. If the firm raised these funds
through the sale of equity, a large number of shares would have to be issued
because of their low market price. This, in turn, could result in the dilution of
existing ownership. Another means of financing the call would be the use of
debt or preferred stock, but this use would leave the firm’s capital structure no
less leveraged than before the call.

DETERMINING THE VALUE OF A CONVERTIBLE BOND
The key characteristic of convertible securities that enhances their marketability
is their ability to minimize the possibility of a loss while providing a possibility of
capital gains. Here we discuss the three values of a convertible bond: (1) the
straight bond value, (2) the conversion value, and (3) the market value.
Straight Bond Value
The straight bond value of a convertible bond is the price at which it would sell
in the market without the conversion feature. This value is found by determining
the value of a nonconvertible bond with similar payments issued by a firm with
the same risk. The straight bond value is typically the floor, or minimum, price at
which the convertible bond would be traded. The straight bond value equals the
present value of the bond’s interest and principal payments discounted at the
interest rate the firm would have to pay on a nonconvertible bond.
Duncan Company, a Southeastern discount store chain, has just sold a $1,000-
par-value, 20-year convertible bond with a 12% coupon interest rate. The bond
interest will be paid at the end of each year, and the principal will be repaid at matu-
rity.10 A straight bond could have been sold with a 14% coupon interest rate, so that
is the discount rate that we use to calculate the straight bond value of Duncan’s con-
vertible. The straight bond value of the convertible is calculated as shown:
Example 17.7 3
CHAPTER 17
Hybrid and Derivative Securities
691
straight bond value
The price at which a
convertible bond would sell 
in the market without the
conversion feature.
10. Just as we did in Chapter 6, we continue to assume the payment of annual rather than semiannual bond interest.
This assumption simplifies the calculations involved, while maintaining the conceptual accuracy of the procedures
presented.

This value, $867.54, is the minimum price at which the convertible bond is
expected to sell. Generally, only in certain instances in which the stock’s market
price is below the conversion price will the bond be expected to sell at this level.
Conversion (or Stock) Value
Recall that the conversion (or stock) value of a convertible security is the value of
the convertible measured in terms of the market price of the common stock into
which the security can be converted. When the market price of the common stock
exceeds the conversion price, the conversion (or stock) value exceeds the par
value. An example will clarify the point.
Duncan Company’s convertible bond, described in Example 17.7, is convertible at
$50 per share. Each bond can be converted into 20 shares because each bond has
Example 17.8 3

a $1,000 par value. The conversion values of the bond when the stock is selling at
$30, $40, $50, $60, $70, and $80 per share are shown in the following table:

When the market price of the common stock exceeds the $50 conversion
price, the conversion value exceeds the $1,000 par value. Because the straight
bond value (calculated in Example 17.7) is $867.54, the bond will, in a stable
environment, never sell for less than this amount, regardless of how low its con-
version value is. If the market price per share were $30, the bond would still sell
for $867.54—not $600—because its value as a bond would dominate.
Market Value
The market value of a convertible is likely to be greater than its straight value or
its conversion value. The amount by which the market value exceeds its straight or
conversion value is called the market premium. The general relationships among
the straight bond value, conversion value, market value, and market premium for
Duncan Company’s convertible bond are shown in Figure 17.1. The straight bond
value acts as a floor for the security’s value up to the point X, where the stock

price is high enough to cause the conversion value to exceed the straight bond

investors a chance to experience attractive capital gains from increases in the stock
price, while taking less risk. The floor (straight bond value) provides protection
against losses resulting from a decline in the stock price caused by falling profits or
other factors. The market premium tends to be greatest when the straight bond
value and conversion (or stock) value are nearly equal. Investors perceive the ben-
efits of these two sources of value to be greatest at this point.

17.4 Stock Purchase Warrants
Stock purchase warrants are similar to stock rights, which were briefly described
in Chapter 7. Stock purchase warrants give their holders the right to purchase a
certain number of shares of the issuer’s common stock at a specified price over a
certain period of time. (Of course, holders of warrants earn no income until the
warrants are exercised or sold.) Warrants also bear some similarity to convert-
ibles in that they provide for the injection of additional equity capital into the
firm at some future date.
KEY CHARACTERISTICS
Warrants are often attached to debt issues as “sweeteners.” When a firm makes a
large bond issue, the attachment of stock purchase warrants may add to the mar-
ketability of the issue and lower the required interest rate. As sweeteners, war-
rants are similar to conversion features. Often, when a new firm is raising its
initial capital, suppliers of debt will require warrants to permit them to share in
whatever success the firm achieves. In addition, established companies sometimes
offer warrants with debt to compensate for risk and thereby lower the interest
rate and/or provide for fewer restrictive covenants.
Exercise Prices
The price at which holders of warrants can purchase a specified number of shares
of common stock is normally referred to as the exercise (or option) price. This
price is usually set at 10 to 20 percent above the market price of the firm’s stock

at the time of issuance. Until the market price of the stock exceeds the exercise
price, holders of warrants will not exercise them because they can purchase the
stock more inexpensively in the marketplace.
Warrants normally have a life of no more than 10 years, although some have
infinite lives. Unlike convertible securities, warrants cannot be called, but their
limited life stimulates holders to exercise their warrants when the exercise price is
below the market price of the firm’s stock.
Warrant Trading
A warrant is usually detachable, which means that the bondholder may sell the
warrant without selling the security to which it is attached. Many detachable
warrants are actively traded in both broker and dealer markets. Many actively
traded warrants are listed on the American Stock Exchange. Warrants often pro-
vide investors with better opportunities for gain (with increased risk) than the
underlying common stock.
Comparison of Warrants to Rights and Convertibles
The similarity between a warrant and a right should be clear. Both result in new
equity capital, although the warrant provides for deferred equity financing. The
life of a right is typically not more than a few months; a warrant is generally exer-
cisable for a period of years. Rights are issued at a subscription price below the
prevailing market price of the stock; warrants are generally issued at an exercise
price 10 to 20 percent above the prevailing market price.
Warrants and convertibles also have similarities. The exercise of a warrant
shifts the firm’s capital structure to a less highly leveraged position because new
common stock is issued without any change in debt. If a convertible bond were
converted, the reduction in leverage would be even more pronounced because
common stock would be issued in exchange for a reduction in debt. In addition,
the exercise of a warrant provides an influx of new capital; with convertibles, the
new capital is raised when the securities are originally issued rather than when
they are converted. The influx of new equity capital resulting from the exercise of
a warrant does not occur until the firm has achieved a certain degree of success
that is reflected in an increased price for its stock. In this case, the firm conve-
niently obtains needed funds.
IMPLIED PRICE OF AN ATTACHED WARRANT
When warrants are attached to a bond, the implied price of a warrant—the price
that is effectively paid for each attached warrant—can be found by first using
Equation 17.1:
(17.1)
The straight bond value is found in a fashion similar to that used in valuing con-
vertible bonds. Dividing the implied price of all warrants by the number of war-
rants attached to each bond results in the implied price of each warrant.

all warrants

warrants attached - Straight bond value

Martin Marine Products, a manufacturer of marine drive shafts and propellers,
just issued a 10.5%-coupon-interest-rate, $1,000-par, 20-year bond paying
annual interest and having 20 warrants attached for the purchase of the firm’s
stock. The bonds were initially sold for their $1,000 par value. When issued, similar-
risk straight bonds were selling to yield a 12% rate of return. The straight value
of the bond would be the present value of its payments discounted at the 12%
yield on similar-risk straight bonds:

Substituting the $1,000 price of the bond with warrants attached and the
$887.96 straight bond value into Equation 17.1, we get an implied price of all
warrants of $112.04:
Dividing the implied price of all warrants by the number of warrants attached to
each bond—20 in this case—we find the implied price of each warrant:
Therefore, by purchasing Martin Marine Products’ bond with warrants attached
for $1,000, one is effectively paying $5.60 for each warrant.
The implied price of each warrant is meaningful only when compared to the
specific features of the warrant—the number of shares that can be purchased and
the specified exercise price. These features can be analyzed in light of the pre-
vailing common stock price to estimate the true market value of each warrant.
Clearly, if the implied price is above the estimated market value, the price of the
bond with warrants attached may be too high. If the implied price is below the
estimated market value, the bond may be quite attractive. Firms must therefore
price their bonds with warrants attached in a way that causes the implied price of
its warrants to fall slightly below their estimated market value. Such an approach
allows the firm to sell the bonds more easily at a lower coupon interest rate than
would apply to straight debt, thereby reducing its debt service costs.
VALUES OF WARRANTS
Like a convertible security, a warrant has both a market value and a theoretical
value. The difference between these values, or the warrant premium, depends
largely on investor expectations and on the ability of investors to get more
leverage from the warrants than from the underlying stock.
Implied price of each warrant = $112.04 , 20 = $5.60
Implied price of all warrants = $1,000 - $887.96 = $112.04

The difference between the
market value and the
theoretical value of a warrant.

Theoretical Value of a Warrant
The theoretical value of a stock purchase warrant is the amount one would
expect the warrant to sell for in the marketplace. Equation 17.2 gives the theo-
retical value of a warrant:
(17.2)
where
The use of Equation 17.2 can be illustrated by the following example.
Dustin Electronics, a major producer of transistors, has outstanding warrants
that are exercisable at $40 per share and entitle holders to purchase three shares
of common stock. The warrants were initially attached to a bond issue to sweeten
the bond. The common stock of the firm is currently selling for $45 per share.
Substituting 
and 
into Equation 17.2 yields a theoret-
ical warrant value of 
.
Market Value of a Warrant
The market value of a stock purchase warrant is generally above the theoretical
value of the warrant. Only when the theoretical value of the warrant is very high
or the warrant is near its expiration date are the market and theoretical values
close. The general relationship between the theoretical and market values of
Dustin Electronics’ warrants is presented graphically in Figure 17.2. The market
value of warrants generally exceeds the theoretical value by the greatest amount
when the stock’s market price is close to the warrant exercise price per share. The
amount of time until expiration also affects the market value of the warrant.
Generally speaking, the closer the warrant is to its expiration date, the more
likely that its market value will equal its theoretical value.
Warrant Premium
The warrant premium, or the amount by which the market value of Dustin
Electronics’ warrants exceeds the theoretical value of these warrants, is also shown in
Figure 17.2. This premium results from a combination of positive investor expecta-
tions and the ability of the investor with a fixed sum to invest to obtain much larger
potential returns (and risk) by trading in warrants rather than the underlying stock.
Stan Buyer has $2,430, which he is interested in investing in
Dustin Electronics. The firm’s stock is currently selling for $45
per share, and its warrants are selling for $18 per warrant. Each warrant entitles
the holder to purchase three shares of Dustin’s common stock at $40 per share.
Because the stock is selling for $45 per share, the theoretical warrant value, cal-
culated in the preceding example, is

PART 8
Special Topics in Managerial Finance

The warrant premium results from positive investor expectations and leverage
opportunities. Stan Buyer could spend his $2,430 in either of two ways: He could
purchase 54 shares of common stock at $45 per share or 135 warrants at $18 per
warrant, ignoring brokerage fees. If Mr. Buyer purchases the stock and its price
rises to $48, he will gain $162 ($3 per share
54 shares) by selling the stock. If
instead he purchases the 135 warrants and the stock price increases by $3 per
share, Mr. Buyer will gain approximately $1,215. Because the price of a share of
stock rises by $3, the price of each warrant can be expected to rise by $9 (because
each warrant can be used to purchase three shares of common stock). A gain of $9
per warrant on 135 warrants means a total gain of $1,215 on the warrants.
The greater leverage associated with trading warrants should be clear from
the example. Of course, because leverage works both ways, it results in greater
risk. If the market price fell by $3, the loss on the stock would be $162, whereas
the loss on the warrants would be close to $1,215. Clearly, investing in warrants
is more risky than investing in the underlying stock.

17.5 Options
In the most general sense, an option can be viewed as an instrument that provides
its holder with an opportunity to purchase or sell a specified asset at a stated
price on or before a set expiration date. Options are probably the most popular
type of derivative security. Today, the interest in options centers on options on
common stock.11 The development of organized options exchanges has created
markets in which to trade these securities. Three basic forms of options are rights,
warrants, and calls and puts. Rights are discussed in Chapter 7, and warrants
were described in the preceding section.
CALLS AND PUTS
The two most common types of options are calls and puts. A call option is an option
to purchase a specified number of shares of a stock (typically 100) on or before a
specified future date at a stated price. The stock that the option holder has the right
to buy is called the underlying asset, and the call option derives its value from the
value of the underlying stock (hence the term derivative security). Call options usu-
ally expire in a few months, although some call options have much longer lives. The
strike price is the price at which the holder of the option can buy a specified amount
of stock at any time prior to the option’s expiration date. A call option is most valu-
able when its strike price is well below the market price of the underlying stock
(hence, the option gives the holder the right to buy the stock at a bargain price).
When the strike price of a call option is less than the market price of the stock, the
option is said to be in the money. The exchange where the option trades generally
sets option strike prices at or near the prevailing market price of the stock at the time
the option is listed for trading. For example, if a firm’s stock is currently selling for
$50 per share, an option exchange might list option contracts for trading with strike
prices of $45, $50, and $55. Like other securities, the value of a call option is deter-
mined by the interactions of buyers and sellers trading options in the market. A call
option’s market price is called the option premium, and it represents the price one
must pay to acquire the right to buy the stock at the strike price.
A put option is an option to sell a specified number of shares of a stock (typ-
ically 100) on or before a specified future date at a stated strike price. Like the
call option, the strike price of the put is set close to the market price of the under-
lying stock at the time of issuance. The lives and costs of puts are similar to those
of calls. A put option is in the money when the market price of the underlying
stock is below the strike price. In that case, the option holder can sell the stock at
an above-market price.
OPTIONS MARKETS
There are two ways of making options transactions. The first involves making a
transaction through one of 20 or so call and put options dealers with the help of
LG 6
11. Real options—opportunities embedded in capital projects that enable management to alter their cash flows and
risk—were discussed in Chapter 12. The options described here differ from real options; they are a type of deriva-
tive security that derives its value from an underlying financial asset, typically common stock. Although some of the
analytical tools used to value both types of options are similar, the focus here is merely on the definitional aspects of
options. The models used to value these options are typically discussed in more advanced financial management
textbooks.

a stockbroker. The other, more popular mechanism is the organized options
exchanges. The dominant exchange is the Chicago Board Options Exchange
(CBOE), which was established in 1973. Other exchanges on which options are
traded include the International Securities Exchange (ISE), the American Stock
Exchange, and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. The options traded on these
exchanges are standardized and thus are considered registered securities. Each
option is for 100 shares of the underlying stock. The price at which options trans-
actions can be made is determined by the forces of supply and demand.
CHAPTER 17
Hybrid and Derivative Securities
699
Matter of fact
L
ike most other companies, the Chicago Board Options Exchange saw a decline in its business
in 2009 due to the recession. The CBOE reported total options trading volume that year of
1.135 billion option contracts, down from 1.193 billion in 2008. The steepest decline came in an
area that had been the CBOE’s fastest growing line of business—options on exchange traded
funds. ETF option trading fell in 2009 to 277 million contracts, down 16 percent from the 
prior year.
Recession Cools Option Trading
OPTIONS TRADING
The most obvious motive for purchasing call options is the expectation that the
market price of the underlying stock will rise by more than enough to cover the
cost of the option, thereby allowing the purchaser of the call to profit.
Assume that Cindy Peters pays $250 for a 3-month call option
on Wing Enterprises, a maker of aircraft components, at a strike
price of $50. This means that by paying $250, Cindy is guaranteed that she can pur-
chase 100 shares of Wing at $50 per share at any time during the next 3 months. If
Wing’s stock price rises above $50, then Cindi could exercise her option to buy the
stock at $50 and then immediately sell it in the open market at the higher market
price. The stock price must climb $2.50 per share ($250
100 shares) to $52.50
per share to cover the cost of the option (ignoring any brokerage fees). If the stock
price rises more than that, then Cindi earns a net profit from buying and exercising
the option. For example, if the stock price were to rise to $60 per share during the
period, Cindy’s net profit would be $750. She could make a $10 profit per share by
exercising her right to buy shares at $50 and then immediately selling them in the
open market for $60 each. Because she has the right to buy 100 shares, Cindy’s gross
profit on this transaction would be $1,000, but because she spent $250 to acquire
the option in the first place, her net profit would be $750.
Because this $750 profit would be earned on a $250 initial investment, it illus-
trates the high potential return on investment that options offer (a 200 percent gain
in this example). Of course, had the stock price not risen above $50 per share, Cindy
would have lost the $250 she invested because there would have been no reason to
exercise the option, and her return on that investment would have been negative
100%. Had the stock price risen to between $50 and $52.50 per share, Cindy would
have exercised the option, though the gain from exercising would not have been
large enough to completely offset the original $250 purchase price of the option.
,
Personal Finance Example 17.12 3

Put options are often purchased in the expectation that the share price of a
given security will decline over the life of the option. Investors gain from put
options when the price of the underlying stock declines by more than the per-
share cost of the option. The logic underlying the purchase of a put is exactly the
opposite of that underlying the use of call options.
Assume that Don Kelly pays $325 for a 6-month put option
on Dante United, a baked goods manufacturer, at a strike
price of $40. Don purchased the put option in expectation that the stock price
would drop because of the introduction of a new product line by Dante’s chief
competitor. By paying $325, Don is assured that he can sell 100 shares of Dante
at $40 per share at any time during the next 6 months. If the stock price drops
below $40, Don can purchase 100 shares at the prevailing market price and
then exercise his option to sell them for $40 each. The stock price must drop by
$3.25 per share ($325
100 shares) to $36.75 per share to cover the cost of
the option (ignoring any brokerage fees). If the stock price falls more than that,
then Don can make a profit from buying and exercising the option. For
example, if the stock price were to drop to $30 per share during the period,
Don could buy 100 shares on the open market for $3,000 and then exercise his
right to sell those shares for $40 each (or $4,000 total). Don’s net profit would be
.
Because that $675 return would be earned on only a $325 investment, it illus-
trates the high potential return on investment that options offer. Of course, had the
stock price risen above $40 per share, Don would have lost the $325 he invested
because there would have been no reason to exercise the option. Had the stock
price fallen to between $36.75 and $40.00 per share, Don would have exercised the
option to reduce his loss to an amount less than $325.
Some investors buy puts not to speculate on a potential price decline but to
protect themselves from that event. Purchasers of puts commonly own the under-
lying shares, and buying puts provides a way to protect the value of the shares
that the investor already owns. For example, an investor who owns 100 shares of
Intel Corp. stock, currently selling for $22 per share, could buy put options on
Intel stock with a $20 strike price. This guarantees that even if the price of Intel
stock plummets, the investor will be able to sell her shares for $20 each.
ROLE OF CALL AND PUT OPTIONS IN FUND RAISING
Although call and put options are extremely popular investment vehicles, they
play no direct role in the fund-raising activities of the firm. These options are
issued by investors and option exchanges, not businesses. They are not a source
of financing to the firm because the firm does not receive the proceeds when
investors buy options, nor do firms receive funds when investors exercise options
to buy shares. Buyers of options have no say in the firm’s management, and they
do not have voting rights; only stockholders are given these privileges. Despite
the popularity of options as investments, the financial manager has very little
need to deal with them, especially as part of fund-raising activities.
However, financial managers do work with stock options when they are part
of employee compensation packages. Employee stock options are a form of call
$675 3(100 shares * $40/share) - (100 shares * $30/share) - $3254

options. As the Focus on Ethics box discusses, a number of companies and com-
pany executives have skated close to, or over, the ethical edge with regard to
backdating of options.
HEDGING FOREIGN-CURRENCY EXPOSURES WITH OPTIONS
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange
(PHLX) offer exchange-traded options contracts on the Canadian dollar, the euro,
the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc, and several other important currencies. Currency
options are used by a wide range of traders, from the largest multinational compa-
nies to small exporters and importers, as well as by individual investors and specu-
lators. Options allow companies to hedge, which involves offsetting or protecting
against the risk of adverse price movements, while simultaneously preserving the

quarter occurred on February 20.
Managers announce that options were
granted on February 20 with a strike
price equal to the stock price at that
time. Of course, with the benefit of hind-
sight, managers know that the stock
price on April 1 is much higher than it
was on February 20, so these “back-
dated” options already have a built-in
profit. Finance professors Erik Lie of the
University of Iowa and Randall Heron of
Indiana University published several stud-
ies showing that the timing of employee
stock option grants at market low points
was too widespread to be coincidental,
so they concluded that many option
grants had been backdated. The SEC
subsequently conducted a yearlong
investigation and began to crack down
on companies with questionable policies
governing stock-option grants. At least
257 companies have announced inter-
nal reviews or have been subject to SEC
or Justice Department inquiries related to
options backdating. Firms that were
investigated saw significant drops in the
market prices of their shares. As a result
of the increased scrutiny, a number of
top-level executives at a variety of com-
panies either resigned or were fired. A
number of companies announced that
they would have to issue a restatement
of prior results to record charges against
earnings that should have been recorded
when the options were granted.
While backdating of options is not
necessarily illegal, the issues relating to
backdating of options involve failure to
provide full disclosure to shareholders,
failure to pay extra applicable taxes,
and earnings statements that should
have reflected the modified grant dates.
Any of these three issues could yield
civil (and perhaps criminal) legal action.
Fortunately, accelerated reporting
requirements have made unreported
backdating more difficult. Section 403
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 now
requires that directors and officers report
options grants to the SEC within 2 busi-
ness days, instead of within weeks and
months as allowed under the prior law.
3 If firms wanted to grant stock
options with strike prices below the
current market price of their stock,
they could do so. Why do you think
instead some firms chose to back-
date options, making it appear as
though the options had been
granted with strike prices equal to
the current stock market price
when in fact the options were in the
money at the time of the grant?
Granting stock options
to executives as well
as rank-and-file employees was a popu-
lar practice in the technology sector for
many years. Start-up companies who
couldn’t afford to pay high salaries
could offer stock options to employees
who were willing to take the risk that
the options would be worth a great
deal if the company took off. Even
technology giants such as Microsoft
and Intel routinely granted options to
nearly all of their employees, many of
whom became wealthy as tech stocks
boomed through the 1990s.
Typically, an employee stock option
has a strike price equal to the market
price of the company’s stock at the time
the option is granted. That practice
ensures that employees make a profit on
their options only when the stock price
rises after the options are awarded. One
way that firms could make their stock
option grants even more valuable to
employees is through a practice known
as backdating. Backdating occurs when
a firm uses hindsight to establish an
option grant date at a time when the
firm’s stock price was at a temporary low
point. For example, on April 1, man-
agers might look back and determine
that the lowest stock price in the prior

possibility of profiting from favorable price movements. Using options to hedge
risk is similar to purchasing insurance. The firm pays a premium (the cost of the
option), and in exchange it receives a cash inflow if the event that the firm is
hedging against actually occurs. If the event does not occur, then the option expires
as worthless and the money spent to acquire the option is lost, just as would be the
case if you purchased auto insurance and never had an accident.
Assume that a U.S. exporter just booked a sale denominated in Swiss francs with
payment due upon delivery in 3 months. The exporter is exposed to currency risk
because when it receives francs in payment it will sell those francs in exchange for
dollars, but the exchange rate at which that transaction will occur is unknown. If
the Swiss franc declines in value, then the dollar value of the payment that the
exporter will receive in 3 months is reduced (because each franc buys fewer dol-
lars on the foreign exchange market). The company could hedge the risk of
depreciation in the franc by purchasing a Swiss franc put option. This would give
the company the right to sell Swiss francs at a fixed price (say, one franc in
exchange for $1.04). This option would become valuable if the value of the Swiss
franc was less than $1.04 when the payment in francs arrives in 3 months. On the
other hand, if one Swiss franc was worth more than $1.04 when the exporter
received payment, the firm would allow the put option to expire unexercised and
would instead convert the Swiss francs received in payment into dollars at the
new, higher dollar price. The exporter would be protected from adverse price risk
but would still be able to profit from favorable price movements.

Summary
FOCUS ON VALUE
In addition to basic corporate securities like stocks and bonds, the firm can use
hybrid securities in its fund-raising activities. These securities, which possess
characteristics of both debt and equity, enable the firm to raise funds at less 
cost or to provide for desired future changes in the firm’s capital structure.
Leasing, particularly financial (capital) leases, may enable the firm to use 
the lease as a substitute for the debt-financed purchase of an asset, with more
attractive risk–return trade-offs. Similarly, by issuing convertible rather than
straight debt or by attaching stock purchase warrants to a bond issue or debt
financing, the firm may provide lenders with the potential to benefit from 
stock price movements in exchange for a lower interest rate or less restrictive
covenants in the bond or debt agreement. Although options are not a source 

of financing to the firm, this derivative security can help provide incentives to
employees. Currency options can be used to hedge adverse currency movements
in international transactions.
Clearly, the financial manager should use hybrid and derivative securities to
increase return (often by lowering financing costs) and reduce risk. By taking
only those actions believed to result in attractive risk–return trade-offs, the
financial manager can positively contribute to the firm’s goal of maximizing the
stock price.
REVIEW OF LEARNING GOALS
Differentiate between hybrid and derivative securities and their roles in
the corporation. Hybrid securities are forms of debt or equity financing that
possess characteristics of both debt and equity. Common hybrid securities include
preferred stock, financial leases, convertible securities, and stock purchase war-
rants. Derivative securities are neither debt nor equity and derive their value from
an underlying asset that is often another security. Options are a popular deriva-
tive security.
Review the types of leases, leasing arrangements, the lease-versus-
purchase decision, the effects of leasing on future financing, and the advantages
and disadvantages of leasing. A lease enables the firm to make contractual, tax-
deductible payments to obtain the use of fixed assets. Operating leases are gen-
erally 5 or fewer years in term, cancelable, and renewable, and they provide for
maintenance by the lessor. Financial leases are longer-term, noncancelable, and
not renewable, and they nearly always require the lessee to maintain the asset.
FASB Statement No. 13 provides specific guidelines for defining a financial (cap-
ital) lease. A lessor can obtain assets to be leased through a direct lease, a sale-
leaseback arrangement, or a leveraged lease. The lease-versus-purchase decision
can be evaluated by calculating the after-tax cash outflows associated with the
leasing and purchasing alternatives. The more desirable alternative is the one
that has the lower present value of after-tax cash outflows. FASB Statement 
No. 13 requires firms to show financial leases as assets and corresponding liabil-
ities on their balance sheets; operating leases must be shown in footnotes to the
financial statements. Advantages and disadvantages should be considered when
making lease-versus-purchase decisions.
Describe the types of convertible securities, their general features, and
financing with convertibles. Corporate bonds and preferred stock may both be
convertible into common stock. The conversion ratio indicates the number of
shares for which a convertible can be exchanged and determines the conversion
price. A conversion privilege is nearly always available at any time in the life of
the security. The conversion value is the value of the convertible measured in
terms of the market price of the common stock into which it can be converted.
The presence of convertibles and other contingent securities (warrants and stock
options) often requires the firm to report both basic and diluted earnings per
share (EPS). Convertibles are used to obtain deferred common stock financing,
to “sweeten” bond issues, to minimize restrictive covenants, and to raise cheap
funds temporarily. The call feature is sometimes used to encourage or “force”
conversion; occasionally, an overhanging issue results.

Demonstrate the procedures for determining the straight bond value, the
conversion (or stock) value, and the market value of a convertible bond. The
straight bond value of a convertible is the price at which it would sell in the
market without the conversion feature. It typically represents the minimum
value at which a convertible bond trades. The conversion value is found by mul-
tiplying the conversion ratio by the current market price of the underlying
common stock. The market value of a convertible generally exceeds both its
straight and conversion values, resulting in a market premium. The premium is
largest when the straight and conversion values are nearly equal.
Explain the key characteristics of stock purchase warrants, the implied
price of an attached warrant, and the values of warrants. Stock purchase war-
rants enable their holders to purchase a certain number of shares of common
stock at the specified exercise price. Warrants are often attached to debt issues
as “sweeteners,” generally have limited lives, are detachable, and may be traded
in broker and dealer markets. Warrants are similar to stock rights, except that
the exercise price of a warrant is initially set above the underlying stock’s cur-
rent market price. Warrants are similar to convertibles, but exercising them has
a less pronounced effect on the firm’s leverage and brings in new funds. The
implied price of an attached warrant can be found by dividing the difference
between the bond price with warrants attached and the straight bond value by
the number of warrants attached to each bond. The market value of a warrant
usually exceeds its theoretical value, creating a warrant premium. Investors 
generally get more leverage from trading warrants than from trading the 
underlying stock.
Define options and discuss calls and puts, options markets, options
trading, the role of call and put options in fund raising, and hedging foreign-
currency exposures with options. An option provides its holder with an oppor-
tunity to purchase or sell a specified asset at a stated price on or before a set
expiration date. Rights, warrants, and calls and puts are all options. Calls are
options to purchase common stock, and puts are options to sell common stock.
Options exchanges provide organized marketplaces in which purchases and
sales of call and put options can be made. The options traded on the exchanges
are standardized, and the prices at which they trade are determined by the 
forces of supply and demand. Call and put options do not play a direct role 
in the fund-raising activities of the financial manager. Currency options 
can be used to hedge the firm’s foreign-currency exposures resulting from 
international transactions.

Lease versus purchase
The Hot Bagel Shop wishes to evaluate two plans for
financing an oven: leasing and borrowing to purchase. The firm is in the 40% tax
bracket.
Lease
The shop can lease the oven under a 5-year lease requiring annual end-of-
year payments of $5,000. All maintenance costs will be paid by the lessor, and
insurance and other costs will be borne by the lessee. The lessee will exercise its
option to purchase the asset for $4,000 at termination of the lease.
Purchase
The oven costs $20,000 and will have a 5-year life. It will be depreci-
ated under MACRS using a 5-year recovery period. (See Table 4.2 on page 117
for the applicable depreciation percentages.) The total purchase price will be
financed by a 5-year, 15% loan requiring equal annual end-of-year payments of
$5,967. The firm will pay $1,000 per year for a service contract that covers all
maintenance costs; insurance and other costs will be borne by the firm. The firm
plans to keep the equipment and use it beyond its 5-year recovery period.
a. For the leasing plan, calculate the following:
(1) The after-tax cash outflow each year.
(2) The present value of the cash outflows, using a 9% discount rate.
b. For the purchasing plan, calculate the following:
(1) The annual interest expense deductible for tax purposes for each of the 
5 years.
(2) The after-tax cash outflow resulting from the purchase for each of the 5 years.
(3) The present value of the cash outflows, using a 9% discount rate.
c. Compare the present values of the cash outflow streams for these two plans, and
determine which plan would be preferable. Explain your answer.

Spreadsheet Exercise
Morris Company, a small manufacturing firm, wants to acquire a new machine that
costs $30,000. Arrangements can be made to lease or purchase the machine. The firm
is in the 40% tax bracket. The firm has gathered the following information about the
two alternatives:
Lease
Morris would obtain a 5-year lease requiring annual end-of-year lease
payments of $10,000. The lessor would pay all maintenance costs; insurance and
other costs would be borne by the lessee. Morris would be given the right to exer-
cise its option to purchase the machine for $3,000 at the end of the lease term.
LG 6

Purchase
Morris can finance the purchase of the machine with an 8.5%, 5-year
loan requiring annual end-of-year installment payments. The machine would be
depreciated under MACRS using a 5-year recovery period. The exact deprecia-
tion rates over the next six periods would be 20%, 32%, 19%, 12%, 12%, and
5%, respectively. Morris would pay $1,200 per year for a service contract that
covers all maintenance costs. The firm plans to keep the machine and use it
beyond its 5-year recovery period.
TO DO
Create a spreadsheet similar to Tables 17.1, 17.2, and 17.3 to answer the following:
a. Calculate the after-tax cash outflow from the lease for Morris Company.
b. Calculate the annual loan payment.
c. Determine the interest and principal components of the loan payments.
d. Calculate the after-tax cash outflows associated with the purchasing option.
e. Calculate and compare the present values of the cash outflows associated with
both the leasing and purchasing options.
f.
Which alternative is preferable? Explain.

Why This Chapter Matters to You
In your professional life
ACCOUNTING You need to understand mergers, leveraged buyouts,
and divestitures of assets to record and report these organizational
changes; you also need to understand bankruptcy procedures because
you will play a large part in any reorganization or liquidation.
INFORMATION SYSTEMS You need to understand what data must be
tracked in the case of mergers, leveraged buyouts, divestitures of
assets, or bankruptcy, to devise the systems needed to effect these orga-
nizational changes.
MANAGEMENT You need to understand the motives for mergers so
that you will know when and why a merger is a good idea. Also, you
may need to know how to fend off an unwelcome takeover attempt,
when to divest the firm of assets for strategic reasons, and what options
are available in the case of business failure.
MARKETING You need to understand mergers and divestitures, which
may enable the firm to grow, diversify, or achieve synergy and there-
fore require changes in the firm’s marketing organization, plans, and
goals.
OPERATIONS You need to understand mergers and divestitures
because ongoing operations will be significantly affected by these
organizational changes. Also, you should know that business failure
may result in reorganization of the firm to provide adequate financing
for ongoing operations.
As an investor, you should under-
stand corporate mergers, leveraged
buyouts, and divestitures. More important, though, is an understanding
of the causes and remedies associated with corporate bankruptcy.
Clearly, an unstated personal financial goal is to avoid bankruptcy, an
outcome that those who develop and implement reasonable personal
financial plans are not likely to experience.

Creating Value by Going Private
A
lthough we commonly think about private firms
going public to create value (as in the opening
story in Chapter 1), quite often firms are taken private
to create value. In February 2010, IMS Health, Inc.
became a private company when it was acquired
through a leveraged buyout (LBO) by investment funds
managed by TPG Capital and the CPP Investment
Board in a transaction valued at $5.8 billion.
Operating in more than 100 countries, IMS is the world’s leading provider of market intelligence
to the pharmaceutical and health care industries. The LBO of IMS marked the first buyout to
exceed $5 billion since the 2008 financial crisis.
When private investors believe that a company is not well-positioned to create value as a
public company, the company may become the target of an LBO. Prior to completing the buyout
of IMS, Mark Wiseman, a senior vice president at CPP, said, “We look forward to working
together and in partnership with [IMS] management to help grow the business.” By taking IMS
private, TPG and CPP expect to capitalize on growth potential that did not exist or was not
accessible while IMS was a public company. There can be several reasons for this, such as the
company’s current business plan, current analyst and trading practices, the increasing cost of
regulatory compliance, and other public company obligations.
Most LBOs have the support of management and shareholders because both parties stand
to gain from any expected value creation. In support of the deal, the IMS Chairman remarked
“this transaction enables our shareholders to realize substantial value from their investment in IMS
with an immediate cash premium, while at the same time strengthening our position to capture
long-term growth opportunities.” Expressing a prominent shareholder view, Charles Bobrinskoy,
vice chairman at Ariel Investments, which owned 7 percent of IMS, stated, “While we believe
that IMS is a very valuable company, it is clear to us that this value will not be recognized in the
public markets. It may be better for IMS to be a private company.”

corporate restructuring
The activities involving
expansion or contraction of a
firm’s operations or changes in
its asset or financial
(ownership) structure.
18.1 Merger Fundamentals
Firms sometimes use mergers to expand externally by acquiring control of
another firm. Whereas the overriding objective for a merger should be to improve
the firm’s share value, a number of more immediate motivations such as diversifi-
cation, tax considerations, and increasing owner liquidity frequently exist.
Sometimes mergers are pursued to acquire specific assets owned by the target
rather than by a desire to run the target as a going concern. Here we discuss
merger fundamentals—terminology, motives, and types. In the following sec-
tions, we will describe the related topics of leveraged buyouts (LBOs) and divesti-
tures and will review the procedures used to analyze and negotiate mergers.
TERMINOLOGY
In the broadest sense, activities involving expansion or contraction of a firm’s
operations or changes in its asset or financial (ownership) structure are called
corporate restructuring. The topics addressed in this chapter—mergers, LBOs,
and divestitures—are some of the most common forms of corporate restruc-
turing. Here, we define some basic merger terminology; other terms are intro-
duced and defined as needed in subsequent discussions.
Mergers, Consolidations, and Holding Companies
A merger occurs when two or more firms are combined and the resulting firm
maintains the identity of one of the firms. Usually, the assets and liabilities of the
smaller firm are merged into those of the larger firm. Consolidation, by contrast,
involves the combination of two or more firms to form a completely new corpo-
ration. The new corporation normally absorbs the assets and liabilities of the
companies from which it is formed. Because of the similarity of mergers and con-
solidations, we use the term merger throughout this chapter to refer to both.
A holding company is a corporation that has voting control of one or more
other corporations. Having control in large, widely held companies generally
requires ownership of between 10 and 20 percent of the outstanding stock. The
companies controlled by a holding company are normally referred to as its
subsidiaries. Control of a subsidiary is typically obtained by purchasing a suffi-
cient number of shares of its stock.
Acquiring versus Target Companies
The firm in a merger transaction that attempts to acquire another firm is com-
monly called the acquiring company. The firm that the acquiring company is pur-
suing is referred to as the target company. Generally, the acquiring company
identifies, evaluates, and negotiates with the management and/or shareholders of
the target company. Occasionally, the management of a target company initiates
its acquisition by seeking out potential acquirers.
Friendly versus Hostile Takeovers
Mergers can occur on either a friendly or a hostile basis. Typically, after identi-
fying the target company, the acquirer initiates discussions. If the target manage-
ment is receptive to the acquirer’s proposal, it may endorse the merger and

recommend shareholder approval. If the stockholders approve the merger, the
transaction is typically consummated either through a cash purchase of shares by
the acquirer or through an exchange of the acquirer’s stock, or some combination
of stock and cash for the target firm’s shares. This type of negotiated transaction
is known as a friendly merger.
If the takeover target’s management does not support the proposed takeover,
it can fight the acquirer’s actions. In this case, the acquirer can attempt to gain
control of the firm by buying sufficient shares of the target firm in the market-
place. This is typically accomplished by using a tender offer, which, as noted in
Chapter 14, is a formal offer to purchase a given number of shares at a specified
price. This type of unfriendly transaction is commonly referred to as a hostile
merger. Clearly, hostile mergers are more difficult to consummate because the
target firm’s management acts to deter rather than facilitate the acquisition.
Regardless, hostile takeovers are sometimes successful.
Strategic versus Financial Mergers
Mergers are undertaken for either strategic or financial reasons. Strategic mergers
seek to achieve various economies of scale by eliminating redundant functions,
increasing market share, improving raw material sourcing and finished product dis-
tribution, and so on.1 In these mergers, the operations of the acquiring and target
firms are combined to achieve synergies, thereby causing the performance of the
merged firm to exceed that of the premerged firms. The mergers of Intel and
McAfee (both high-tech firms) and Norwest and Wells Fargo (both banks) are
examples of strategic mergers. An interesting variation of the strategic merger
involves the purchase of specific product lines (rather than the whole company) for
strategic reasons. The acquisition of HarperCollins’s college publishing division by
Addison-Wesley is an example of such a merger.
Financial mergers are based on the acquisition of companies that can be
restructured to improve their cash flow. These mergers involve the acquisition of
the target firm by an acquirer, which may be another company or a group of
investors that may even include the target firm’s existing management. The objec-
tive of the acquirer is to cut costs drastically and sell off certain unproductive or
noncompatible assets in an effort to increase the target firm’s cash flow. The
increased cash flow is used to service the sizable debt that is typically incurred to
finance these transactions. Financial mergers are based not on the firm’s ability to
achieve economies of scale but rather on the acquirer’s belief that through
restructuring, the firm’s unrealized value can be unlocked.
The ready availability of junk bond financing throughout the 1980s fueled
the financial merger mania during that period. With the collapse of the junk bond
market in the early 1990s, the bankruptcy filings of a number of prominent
financial mergers of the 1980s, and the rising stock market of the later 1990s,
financial mergers lost their luster. As a result, the strategic merger, which does not
rely so heavily on debt, continues to dominate today.

pany with established products and channels of distribution and an emerging technology company with a promising
research and development program in areas of interest to the larger company. In exchange for its financial support,
the larger, established company obtains a stake in the technology being developed by the emerging company. Today,
strategic alliances are commonplace in the biotechnology, information technology, and software industries.

MOTIVES FOR MERGING
Firms merge to fulfill certain objectives. The overriding goal for merging is maxi-
mization of the owners’ wealth as reflected in the acquirer’s share price. More spe-
cific motives include growth or diversification, synergy, fund raising, increased
managerial skill or technology, tax considerations, increased ownership liquidity,
and defense against takeover. These motives should be pursued when they lead to
owner wealth maximization.
Growth or Diversification
Companies that desire rapid growth in size or market share or diversification in
the range of their products may find that a merger can fulfill this objective.
Instead of relying entirely on internal or “organic” growth, the firm may achieve
its growth or diversification objectives much faster by merging with an existing
firm. Such a strategy is often less costly than the alternative of developing the nec-
essary production capacity. If a firm that wants to expand operations can find a
suitable going concern, it may avoid many of the risks associated with the design,
manufacture, and sale of additional or new products. Moreover, when a firm
expands or extends its product line by acquiring another firm, it may remove a
potential competitor.
Synergy
The synergy of mergers is the economies of scale resulting from the merged firms’
lower overhead. These economies of scale from lowering the combined overhead
increase earnings to a level greater than the sum of the earnings of each of the
independent firms. Synergy is most obvious when firms merge with other firms in
the same line of business because many redundant functions and employees can
be eliminated. Staff functions, such as purchasing and sales, are probably most
greatly affected by this type of combination.
Fund Raising
Often, firms combine to enhance their fund-raising ability. A firm may be unable to
obtain funds for its own internal expansion but able to obtain funds for external
business combinations. Quite often, one firm may combine with another that has
high liquid assets and low levels of liabilities. The acquisition of this type of “cash-
rich” company immediately increases the firm’s borrowing power by decreasing its
financial leverage. This should allow funds to be raised externally at lower cost.
Increased Managerial Skill or Technology
Occasionally, a firm will have good potential that it finds itself unable to develop
fully because of deficiencies in certain areas of management or an absence of
needed product or production technology. If the firm cannot hire the manage-
ment or develop the technology it needs, it might combine with a compatible firm
that has the needed managerial personnel or technical expertise. Of course, any
merger should contribute to maximizing the owners’ wealth.
Tax Considerations
Quite often, tax considerations are a key motive for merging. In such a case, the
tax benefit generally stems from the fact that one of the firms has a tax loss carry-
forward. This means that the company’s tax loss can be applied against a limited

amount of future income of the merged firm over 20 years or until the total tax
loss has been fully recovered, whichever comes first.2 Two situations could actu-
ally exist. A company with a tax loss could acquire a profitable company to use
the tax loss. In this case, the acquiring firm would boost the combination’s after-
tax earnings by reducing the taxable income of the acquired firm. A tax loss may
also be useful when a profitable firm acquires a firm that has such a loss. In either
situation, however, the merger must be justified not only on the basis of the tax
benefits but also on grounds consistent with the goal of owner wealth maximiza-
tion. Moreover, the tax benefits described can be used only in mergers—not in the
formation of holding companies—because only in the case of mergers are oper-
ating results reported on a consolidated basis. An example will clarify the use of
the tax loss carryforward.
Bergen Company, a wheel bearing manufacturer, has a total of $450,000 in tax loss
carryforwards resulting from operating tax losses of $150,000 per year in each of
the past 3 years. To use these losses and to diversify its operations, Hudson
Company, a molder of plastics, has acquired Bergen through a merger. Hudson
expects to have earnings before taxes of $300,000 per year. We assume that these
earnings are realized, that they fall within the annual limit that is legally allowed
for application of the tax loss carryforward resulting from the merger (see footnote
2), that the Bergen portion of the merged firm just breaks even, and that Hudson is
in the 40% tax bracket. The total taxes paid by the two firms and their after-tax
earnings without and with the merger are as shown in Table 18.1.
Example 18.1 3
CHAPTER 18

2. To deter firms from combining solely to take advantage of tax loss carryforwards, the Tax Reform Act of 1986
imposed an annual limit on the amount of taxable income against which such losses can be applied. The annual limit
is determined by formula and is tied to the value of the loss corporation before the combination. Although not fully
eliminating this motive for combination, the act makes it more difficult for firms to justify combinations solely on
the basis of tax loss carryforwards.

With the merger the total tax payments are less—$180,000 (total of line 7)
versus $360,000 (total of line 2). With the merger the total after-tax earnings are
more—$720,000 (total of line 8) versus $540,000 (total of line 3). The merged
firm is able to deduct the tax loss over 20 years or until the total tax loss is fully
recovered, whichever comes first. In this example, the total tax loss is fully
deducted by the end of year 2.
Increased Ownership Liquidity
The merger of two small firms or of a small and a larger firm may provide the
owners of the small firm(s) with greater liquidity. This is due to the higher mar-
ketability associated with the shares of larger firms. Instead of holding shares in a
small firm that has a very “thin” market, the owners will receive shares that are
traded in a broader market and can thus be liquidated more readily. Also, owning
shares for which market price quotations are readily available provides owners
with a better sense of the value of their holdings. Especially in the case of small,
closely held firms, the improved liquidity of ownership obtainable through
merger with an acceptable firm may have considerable appeal.
Defense against Takeover
Occasionally, when a firm becomes the target of an unfriendly takeover, it will
acquire another company as a defensive tactic. Such a strategy typically works
like this: The original target firm takes on additional debt to finance its defensive
acquisition; because of the debt load, the target firm becomes too highly lever-
aged financially to be of any further interest to its suitor. To be effective, a defen-
sive takeover must create greater value for shareholders than they would have
realized had the firm been merged with its suitor.
TYPES OF MERGERS
The four types of mergers are the (1) horizontal merger, (2) vertical merger, (3)
congeneric merger, and (4) conglomerate merger. A horizontal merger results
when two firms in the same line of business are merged. An example is the merger
of two machine tool manufacturers. This form of merger results in the expansion
of a firm’s operations in a given product line and at the same time eliminates a
competitor. A vertical merger occurs when a firm acquires a supplier or a cus-
tomer. For example, the merger of a machine tool manufacturer with its supplier
of castings is a vertical merger. The economic benefit of a vertical merger stems
from the firm’s increased control over the acquisition of raw materials or the dis-
tribution of finished goods.
A congeneric merger is achieved by acquiring a firm that is in the same gen-
eral industry but is neither in the same line of business nor a supplier or customer.
An example is the merger of a machine tool manufacturer with the manufacturer
of industrial conveyor systems. The benefit of a congeneric merger is the resulting
ability to use the same sales and distribution channels to reach customers of 
both businesses. A conglomerate merger involves the combination of firms in
unrelated businesses. The merger of a machine tool manufacturer with a chain of
fast-food restaurants is an example of this kind of merger. The key benefit of the
conglomerate merger is its ability to reduce risk by merging firms that have dif-
ferent seasonal or cyclic patterns of sales and earnings.

CHAPTER 18
Mergers, LBOs, Divestitures, and Business Failure
721
18.2 LBOs and Divestitures
Before we address the mechanics of merger analysis and negotiation, you need to
understand two topics that are closely related to mergers—leveraged buyouts
(LBOs) and divestitures. An LBO is a method of structuring an acquisition, and
divestitures involve the sale of a firm’s assets.
LEVERAGED BUYOUTS (LBOS)
A popular technique that was widely used during the 1980s to make acquisitions
is the leveraged buyout (LBO), which involves the use of a large amount of debt
to purchase a firm. LBOs are a clear-cut example of a financial merger under-
taken to create a high-debt private corporation with improved cash flow and
value. Typically, in an LBO, 90 percent or more of the purchase price is financed
with debt. A large part of the borrowing is secured by the acquired firm’s assets,
and the lenders, because of the high risk, take a portion of the firm’s equity. Junk
bonds have been routinely used to raise the large amounts of debt needed to
finance LBO transactions. Of course, the purchasers in an LBO expect to use the
improved cash flow to service the large amount of junk bond and other debt
incurred in the buyout.
An attractive candidate for acquisition via a leveraged buyout should possess
three key attributes:
1. It must have a good position in its industry, with a solid profit history and
reasonable expectations of growth.
2. The firm should have a relatively low level of debt and a high level of “bank-
able” assets that can be used as loan collateral.
3. It must have stable and predictable cash flows that are adequate to meet
interest and principal payments on the debt and provide adequate working
capital.
Of course, a willingness on the part of existing ownership and management to
sell the company on a leveraged basis is also needed.
Many LBOs did not live up to original expectations. One of the largest ever
was the late 1988, $24.5 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco by KKR. RJR was taken
public in 1991, and the firm continued to struggle under the heavy debt of the
LBO for a few years before improving its debt position and credit rating. Campeau

Corporation’s buyouts of Allied Stores and Federated Department Stores resulted
in its later filing for bankruptcy protection, from which reorganized companies
later emerged. In earlier years, other highly publicized LBOs have defaulted on
the high-yield debt incurred to finance the buyout. Although the LBO remains a
viable financing technique under the right circumstances, its use is greatly dimin-
ished from the frenzied pace of the 1980s. Whereas the LBOs of the 1980s were
used, often indiscriminately, for hostile takeovers, today LBOs are most often
used to finance management buyouts.
DIVESTITURES
Companies often achieve external expansion by acquiring an operating unit—
plant, division, product line, subsidiary, and so on—of another company. In such
a case, the seller generally believes that the value of the firm will be enhanced by
converting the unit into cash or some other more productive asset. The selling of
some of a firm’s assets is called divestiture. Unlike business failure, divestiture is
often undertaken for positive motives: to generate cash for expansion of other
product lines, to get rid of a poorly performing operation, to streamline the cor-
poration, or to restructure the corporation’s business in a manner consistent with
its strategic goals.
A personal finance decision that young families with children
frequently face is whether a stay-at-home parent should “divest”
his or her child-care duties, hire child care, and return to work. Whereas the emo-
tional aspects of such a decision are nonquantifiable, the economics of such a
decision are measurable.
Take the case of Elena and Gino Deluca, who have two children, ages 2 and 4.
They are in the process of analyzing whether it makes economic sense to hire child
care and have Elena return to work as a credit analyst. They estimate that Elena
will earn $5,800 per month gross, including her employer’s 401(k) contributions.
In addition, she expects to receive monthly employer-paid benefits that include
health insurance, life insurance, and pension contributions totaling $1,800. She
expects her federal and state income taxes to total about $1,900 per month. The
Delucas estimate total additional expenses (child care, clothing and personal
expenses, meals away from home, and transportation) related to Elana’s job to
total $1,500 per month. They summarized these monthly estimates as follows:
Additional gross income

operating unit
A part of a business, such as a
plant, division, product line, or
subsidiary, that contributes to
the actual operations of the
firm.
divestiture
The selling of some of a firm’s
assets for various strategic
reasons.

Firms divest themselves of operating units by a variety of methods. One
involves the sale of a product line to another firm. An example is Paramount’s
sale of Simon and Schuster to Pearson PLC to free up cash and allow Paramount
to focus its business better on global mass consumer markets. Outright sales of
operating units can be accomplished on a cash or stock swap basis via the proce-
dures described later in this chapter. A second method that has become popular
involves the sale of the unit to existing management. This sale is often achieved
through the use of a leveraged buyout (LBO).
Sometimes divestiture is achieved through a spin-off, which results in an
operating unit becoming an independent company. A spin-off is accomplished by
issuing shares in the divested operating unit on a pro rata basis to the parent com-
pany’s shareholders. Such an action allows the unit to be separated from the cor-
poration and to trade as a separate entity. An example was the decision by AT&T
to spin off its Global Information Solutions unit (formerly and now NCR, which
produces electronic terminals and computers), to allow AT&T to focus better on
its core communications business. Like outright sale, this approach achieves the
divestiture objective, although it does not bring additional cash or stock to the
parent company. The final and least popular approach to divestiture involves
liquidation of the operating unit’s individual assets.
Regardless of the method used to divest a firm of an unwanted operating
unit, the goal typically is to create a more lean and focused operation that will
enhance the efficiency as well as the profitability of the enterprise and create
maximum value for shareholders. Recent divestitures seem to suggest that
many operating units are worth much more to others than to the firm itself.
Comparisons of postdivestiture and predivestiture market values have shown
that the breakup value—the sum of the values of a firm’s operating units if
each were sold separately—of many firms is significantly greater than their
combined value. As a result of market valuations, divestiture often creates
value in excess of the cash or stock received in the transaction. Although these
outcomes frequently occur, financial theory has been unable to explain them
fully and satisfactorily.

18.3 Analyzing and Negotiating Mergers
We now turn to the procedures that are used to analyze and negotiate mergers.
Initially, we will consider how to value the target company and how to use stock
swap transactions to acquire companies. Next, we will look at the merger negoti-
ation process. We will then review the major advantages and disadvantages of
holding companies. Finally, we will discuss international mergers.

VALUING THE TARGET COMPANY
Once the acquiring company isolates a target company that it wishes to acquire,
it must estimate the target’s value. The value is then used, along with a proposed
financing scheme, to negotiate the transaction—on a friendly or hostile basis. The
value of the target is estimated by using the valuation techniques presented in
Chapter 7 and applied to long-term investment decisions in Chapters 10, 11, and
12. Similar capital budgeting techniques are applied whether the target firm is
being acquired for its assets or as a going concern.
Acquisitions of Assets
Occasionally, a firm is acquired not for its income-earning potential but as a col-
lection of assets (generally fixed assets) that the acquiring company needs. The
price paid for this type of acquisition depends largely on which assets are being
acquired; consideration must also be given to the value of any tax losses. To
determine whether the purchase of assets is financially justified, the acquirer must
estimate both the costs and the benefits of the target assets. This is a capital budg-
eting problem (see Chapters 10, 11, and 12), because an initial cash outlay is
made to acquire assets, and as a result, future cash inflows are expected.
Clark Company, a major manufacturer of electrical transformers, is interested in
acquiring certain fixed assets of Noble Company, an industrial electronics com-
pany. Noble, which has tax loss carryforwards from losses over the past 5 years,
is interested in selling out, but it wishes to sell out entirely, not just to get rid of
certain fixed assets. A condensed balance sheet for Noble Company follows.

Clark Company needs only machines B and C and the land and buildings.
However, it has made some inquiries and has arranged to sell the accounts receiv-
able, inventories, and machine A for $23,000. Because there is also $2,000 in
cash, Clark will get $25,000 for the excess assets. Noble wants $100,000 for the
entire company, which means that Clark will have to pay the firm’s creditors
$80,000 and its owners $20,000. The actual outlay required of Clark after liqui-
dating the unneeded assets will be 
.
$75,000 3($80,000 + $20,000) - $25,0004

In other words, to obtain the use of the desired assets (machines B and C and the
land and buildings) and the benefits of Noble’s tax losses, Clark must pay
$75,000. The after-tax cash inflows that are expected to result from the new
assets and applicable tax losses are $14,000 per year for the next 5 years and
$12,000 per year for the following 5 years. The desirability of this asset acquisi-
tion can be determined by calculating the net present value of this outlay using
Clark Company’s 11% cost of capital, as shown in Table 18.2. Because the net
present value of $3,063 is greater than zero, Clark’s value should be increased by
acquiring Noble Company’s assets.
Acquisitions of Going Concerns
Acquisitions of target companies that are going concerns are best analyzed by
using capital budgeting techniques similar to those described for asset acquisi-
tions. The methods of estimating expected cash flows from an acquisition are
similar to those used in estimating capital budgeting cash flows. Typically, pro
forma income statements reflecting the postmerger revenues and costs attribut-
able to the target company are prepared (see Chapter 4). They are then adjusted
to reflect the expected cash flows over the relevant time period. Whenever a firm
considers acquiring a target company that has different risk behaviors, it should
risk-adjust the cost of capital before applying the appropriate capital budgeting
techniques (see Chapter 12).
Square Company, a major media company, is contemplating the acquisition of
Circle Company, a small independent film producer that can be purchased for
$60,000. Square currently has a high degree of financial leverage, which is reflected
in its 13% cost of capital. Because of the low financial leverage of Circle Company,
Square estimates that its overall cost of capital will drop to 10% after the acquisi-
tion. Because the effect of the less risky capital structure cannot be reflected in the
expected cash flows, the postmerger cost of capital (10%) must be used to evaluate

the cash flows that are expected from the acquisition. The postmerger cash flows
attributable to the target company are forecast over a 30-year time horizon.
These estimated cash flows (all inflows) and the resulting net present value of the
target company, Circle Company, are shown in Table 18.3.
Because the $2,364 net present value of the target company is greater than
zero, the merger is acceptable. Note that if the effect of the changed capital struc-
ture on the cost of capital had not been considered, the acquisition would have
been found unacceptable, because the net present value at a 13% cost of capital
is negative $11,868.
STOCK SWAP TRANSACTIONS
Once the value of the target company is determined, the acquirer must develop a
proposed financing package. The simplest (but probably the least common) case
is a pure cash purchase. Beyond this extreme case, there are virtually an infinite
number of financing packages that use various combinations of cash, debt, pre-
ferred stock, and common stock.
Here we look at the other extreme—stock swap transactions, in which the
acquisition is paid for using an exchange of common stock. The acquiring firm
exchanges its shares for shares of the target company according to a predeter-
mined ratio. The ratio of exchange of shares is determined in the merger negotia-
tions. This ratio affects the various financial yardsticks that are used by existing
and prospective shareholders to value the merged firm’s shares. The use of stock
swaps to finance mergers is a popular approach.
Ratio of Exchange
When one firm swaps its stock for the shares of another firm, the firms must
determine the number of shares of the acquiring firm to be exchanged for each
share of the target firm. The first requirement, of course, is that the acquiring
company have sufficient shares available to complete the transaction. Often, a
firm’s repurchase of shares (discussed in Chapter 14) is necessary to obtain suffi-
cient shares for such a transaction. The acquiring firm generally offers enough of
its own shares that the value of the shares given up exceeds the value of one target
share. The actual ratio of exchange is merely the ratio of the amount paid

per share of the target company to the market price per share of the acquiring
firm. It is calculated in this manner because the acquiring firm pays the target
firm in stock, which has a value equal to its market price.
Grand Company, a leather products concern whose stock is currently selling for
$80 per share, is interested in acquiring Small Company, a producer of belts. To
prepare for the acquisition, Grand has been repurchasing its own shares over the
past 3 years. Small’s stock is currently selling for $75 per share, but in the merger
negotiations Grand has found it necessary to offer Small $110 per share. Because
Grand does not have sufficient financial resources to purchase the firm for cash
and does not wish to raise these funds, Small has agreed to accept Grand’s stock in
exchange for its shares. As stated, Grand’s stock currently sells for $80 per share,
and it must pay $110 per share for Small’s stock. Therefore, the ratio of exchange
is 1.375 ($110
$80). This means that Grand Company must exchange 1.375
shares of its stock for each share of Small’s stock.
Effect on Earnings per Share
Although cash flows and value are the primary focus of merger analysis, it is useful
to consider the effects of a proposed merger on earnings per share—the accounting
returns that are related to cash flows and value (see Chapter 7). Ordinarily, the
resulting earnings per share differ from the premerger earnings per share for both
the acquiring firm and the target firm. They depend largely on the ratio of exchange
and the premerger earnings per share of each firm. It is best to view the initial and
long-run effects of the ratio of exchange on earnings per share separately.
Initial Effect
When the ratio of exchange is equal to 1 and both the
acquiring firm and the target firm have the same premerger earnings per share,
the merged firm’s earnings per share will initially remain constant. In this rare
instance, both the acquiring firm and the target firm would also have equal
price/earnings (P/E) ratios. In actuality, the earnings per share of the merged firm
are generally above the premerger earnings per share of one firm and below the
premerger earnings per share of the other, after the necessary adjustment has been
made for the ratio of exchange.
As we saw in the preceding example, Grand Company is contemplating acquiring
Small Company by swapping 1.375 shares of its stock for each share of Small’s
stock. The current financial data related to the earnings and market price for each
of these companies are given in Table 18.4.

TABLE 18.4

To complete the merger and retire the 20,000 shares of Small Company
stock outstanding, Grand will have to issue and (or) use treasury stock totaling
27,500 shares (1.375
20,000 shares). Once the merger is completed, Grand
will have 152,500 shares of common stock (125,000
27,500) outstanding. If
the earnings of each of the firms remain constant, the merged company will be
expected to have earnings available for the common stockholders of $600,000
($500,000
$100,000). The earnings per share of the merged company there-
fore should equal approximately $3.93 ($600,000
152,500 shares).
It would appear at first that Small Company’s shareholders have sustained a
decrease in per-share earnings from $5 to $3.93, but because each share of Small
Company’s original stock is equivalent to 1.375 shares of the merged company’s
stock the equivalent earnings per share are actually $5.40 ($3.93
1.375). In
other words, as a result of the merger, Grand Company’s original shareholders
experience a decrease in earnings per share from $4 to $3.93 to the benefit of
Small Company’s shareholders, whose earnings per share increase from $5 to
$5.40. These results are summarized in Table 18.5.
The postmerger earnings per share for owners of the acquiring and target
companies can be explained by comparing the price/earnings ratio paid by the
acquiring company with its initial P/E ratio. Table 18.6 summarizes this relation-
ship. By paying more than its current value per dollar of earnings to acquire each
dollar of earnings (P/E paid
P/E of acquiring company), the acquiring firm
transfers the claim on a portion of its premerger earnings to the owners of the

target firm. Therefore, on a postmerger basis the target firm’s EPS increases, and
the acquiring firm’s EPS decreases. Note that this outcome is nearly always the
case because the acquirer typically pays, on average, a 50 percent premium above
the target firm’s market price, which results in the P/E paid being much above its
own P/E. The P/E ratios associated with the Grand–Small merger demonstrate the
effect of the merger on EPS.
Grand Company’s P/E ratio is 20, and the P/E ratio paid for Small Company’s
earnings was 22 ($110
$5). Because the P/E paid for Small Company was
greater than the P/E for Grand Company (22 versus 20), the effect of the merger
was to decrease the EPS for original holders of shares in Grand Company (from
$4.00 to $3.93) and to increase the effective EPS of original holders of shares in
Small Company (from $5.00 to $5.40).
Long-Run Effect
The long-run effect of a merger on the earnings per share of
the merged company depends largely on whether the earnings of the merged firm
grow. Often, although an initial decrease in the per-share earnings of the stock held
by the original owners of the acquiring firm is expected, the long-run effects of the
merger on earnings per share are quite favorable. Because firms generally expect
growth in earnings, the key factor enabling the acquiring company to experience
higher future EPS than it would have without the merger is that the earnings attrib-
utable to the target company’s assets grow more rapidly than those resulting from
the acquiring company’s premerger assets. An example will clarify this point.
In 2012, Grand Company acquired Small Company by swapping 1.375 shares of
its common stock for each share of Small Company. Other key financial data and
the effects of this exchange ratio were discussed in preceding examples. The total
earnings of Grand Company were expected to grow at an annual rate of 3%
without the merger; Small Company’s earnings were expected to grow at a 7%
annual rate without the merger. The same growth rates are expected to apply to
the component earnings streams with the merger. The table in Figure 18.1 shows
the future effects on EPS for Grand Company without and with the proposed
Small Company merger, on the basis of these growth rates.
The table indicates that the earnings per share without the merger will be
greater than the EPS with the merger for the years 2012 through 2014. After
2014, however, the EPS will be higher than they would have been without the
merger as a result of the faster earnings growth rate of Small Company (7% versus
3%). Although a few years are required for this difference in the growth rate of
earnings to pay off, in the future Grand Company will receive an earnings benefit
as a result of merging with Small Company at a 1.375 ratio of exchange. The long-
run earnings advantage of the merger is clearly depicted in Figure 18.1.3

3. To discover properly whether the merger is beneficial, the earnings estimates under each alternative would have to
be made over a long period of time—say, 50 years—and then converted to cash flows and discounted at the appro-
priate rate. The alternative with the higher present value would be preferred. For simplicity, only the basic intuitive
view of the long-run effect is presented here.

Effect on Market Price per Share
The market price per share does not necessarily remain constant after the acqui-
sition of one firm by another. Adjustments occur in the marketplace in response
to changes in expected earnings, the dilution of ownership, changes in risk, and
certain other operating and financial changes. By using the ratio of exchange, we
can calculate a ratio of exchange in market price. It indicates the market price per
share of the acquiring firm paid for each dollar of market price per share of the
target firm. This ratio, the MPR, is defined by Equation 18.1:
(18.1)
where
 RE = ratio of exchange
 MPtarget = market price per share of the target firm
 MPacquiring = market price per share of the acquiring firm
 MPR = market price ratio of exchange

ratio of exchange in 
market price
Indicates the market price per
share of the acquiring firm
paid for each dollar of market
price per share of the target
firm.

The market price of Grand Company’s stock was $80, and that of Small Company’s
was $75. The ratio of exchange was 1.375. Substituting these values into Equation
18.1 yields a ratio of exchange in market price of 
.
This means that $1.47 of the market price of Grand Company is given in
exchange for every $1.00 of the market price of Small Company.
The ratio of exchange in market price is normally greater than 1, which indi-
cates that to acquire a firm, the acquirer must pay a premium above the target’s
market price. Even so, the original owners of the acquiring firm may still gain,
because the merged firm’s stock may sell at a price/earnings ratio above the indi-
vidual premerger ratios. This results from the improved risk and return relation-
ship perceived by shareholders and other investors.
The financial data developed earlier for the Grand–Small merger can be used to
explain the market price effects of a merger. If the earnings of the merged com-
pany remain at the premerger levels, and if the stock of the merged company sells
at an assumed multiple of 21 times earnings, the values in Table 18.7 can be
expected. Although Grand Company’s earnings per share decline from $4.00 to
$3.93 (see Table 18.5), the market price of its shares will increase from $80.00 to
$82.53 as a result of the merger.
Although the behavior exhibited in the preceding example is not unusual, the
financial manager must recognize that only with proper management of the
merged enterprise can its market value be improved. If the merged firm cannot
achieve sufficiently high earnings in view of its risk, there is no guarantee that its
market price will reach the forecast value. Nevertheless, a policy of acquiring
firms with low P/Es can produce favorable results for the owners of the acquiring
firm. Acquisitions are especially attractive when the acquiring firm’s stock price is
high, because fewer shares must be exchanged to acquire a given firm.
MERGER NEGOTIATION PROCESS
Mergers are often handled by investment bankers—financial intermediaries who, in
addition to their role in selling new security issues (described in Chapter 7), can be
hired by acquirers to find suitable target companies and assist in negotiations. Once a
target company is selected, the investment banker negotiates with its management or
investment banker. Likewise, when management wishes to sell the firm or an oper-
ating unit of the firm, it will hire an investment banker to seek out potential buyers.

investment bankers
Financial intermediaries who,
in addition to their role in
selling new security issues, can
be hired by acquirers in
mergers to find suitable target
companies and assist in
negotiations.

If attempts to negotiate with the management of the target company break
down, the acquiring firm, often with the aid of its investment banker, can make a
direct appeal to shareholders by using tender offers (as explained in the following
discussion). The investment banker is typically compensated with a fixed fee, a com-
mission tied to the transaction price, or a combination of fees and commissions.
Management Negotiations
To initiate negotiations, the acquiring firm must make an offer either in cash or
based on a stock swap with a specified ratio of exchange. The target company
then reviews the offer and, in light of alternative offers, accepts or rejects the
terms presented. A desirable merger candidate may receive more than a single
offer. Normally, it is necessary to resolve certain nonfinancial issues related to the
existing management, product line policies, financing policies, and the independ-
ence of the target firm. The key factor, of course, is the per-share price offered in
cash or reflected in the ratio of exchange. Sometimes negotiations break down.
Tender Offers
When negotiations for an acquisition fail, tender offers may be used to negotiate a
“hostile merger” directly with the firm’s stockholders. As noted in Chapter 14, a
tender offer is a formal offer to purchase a given number of shares of a firm’s stock
at a specified price. The offer is made to all the stockholders at a premium above
the market price. Occasionally, the acquirer will make a two-tier offer, in which the
terms offered are more attractive to those who tender shares early. For example,
the acquirer offers to pay $25 per share for the first 60 percent of the outstanding
shares tendered and only $23 per share for the remaining shares. The stock-
holders are advised of a tender offer through announcements in financial news-
papers or through direct communications from the offering firm. Sometimes a
tender offer is made to add pressure to existing merger negotiations. In other
cases, the tender offer may be made without warning as an attempt at an abrupt
corporate takeover.
Fighting Hostile Takeovers
If the management of a target firm does not favor a merger or considers the price
offered in a proposed merger too low, it is likely to take defensive actions to ward
off the hostile takeover. Such actions are generally taken with the assistance of
investment bankers and lawyers who help the firm develop and employ effective
takeover defenses. There are obvious strategies, such as informing stockholders
of the alleged damaging effects of a takeover, acquiring another company (dis-
cussed earlier in the chapter), or attempting to sue the acquiring firm on antitrust
or other grounds. In addition, many other defenses exist (some with colorful
names)—white knight, poison pills, greenmail, leveraged recapitalization, golden
parachutes, and shark repellents.
The white knight strategy involves the target firm finding a more suitable
acquirer (the “white knight”) and prompting it to compete with the initial hostile
acquirer to take over the firm. If being taken over is nearly certain, the target firm
attempts to be taken over by a firm deemed most acceptable to its management.
Poison pills typically involve the creation of securities that give their holders cer-
tain rights that become effective when a takeover is attempted. The “pill” allows
the shareholders to receive special voting rights or securities that make the firm

less desirable to the hostile acquirer. Greenmail is a strategy by which the firm
repurchases, through private negotiation, a large block of stock at a premium
from one or more shareholders to end a hostile takeover attempt by those share-
holders. Clearly, greenmail is a form of corporate blackmail by the holders of a
large block of shares.
Another defense against hostile takeover involves the use of a leveraged
recapitalization, which is a strategy involving the payment of a large debt-
financed cash dividend. This strategy significantly increases the firm’s financial
leverage, thereby deterring the takeover attempt. In addition, as a further deter-
rent, the recapitalization is often structured to increase the equity and control of
the existing management. Golden parachutes are provisions in the employment
contracts of key executives that provide them with sizable compensation if the
firm is taken over. Golden parachutes deter hostile takeovers to the extent that
the cash outflows required by these contracts are large enough to make the
takeover unattractive to the acquirer. Another defense is use of shark repellents,
which are antitakeover amendments to the corporate charter that constrain the
firm’s ability to transfer managerial control of the firm as a result of a merger.
Although this defense could entrench existing management, many firms have had
these amendments ratified by shareholders.
Because takeover defenses tend to insulate management from shareholders,
the potential for litigation is great when these strategies are employed. Lawsuits
are sometimes filed against management by dissident shareholders. In addition,
federal and state governments frequently intervene when a proposed takeover is
deemed to be in violation of federal or state law. A number of states have legisla-
tion on their books limiting or restricting hostile takeovers of companies domi-
ciled within their boundaries.
HOLDING COMPANIES
A holding company is a corporation that has voting control of one or more other
corporations. The holding company may need to own only a small percentage of
the outstanding shares to have this voting control. In the case of companies with
a relatively small number of shareholders, as much as 30 to 40 percent of the
stock may be required. In the case of firms with a widely dispersed ownership, 10
to 20 percent of the shares may be sufficient to gain voting control. A holding
company that wants to obtain voting control of a firm may use direct market pur-
chases or tender offers to acquire needed shares. Although there are relatively few
holding companies and they are far less important than mergers, it is helpful to
understand their key advantages and disadvantages.
Advantages of Holding Companies
The primary advantage of holding companies is the leverage effect that permits
the firm to control a large amount of assets with a relatively small dollar invest-
ment. In other words, the owners of a holding company can control significantly
larger amounts of assets than they could acquire through mergers.
Carr Company, a holding company, currently holds voting control of two sub-
sidiaries—company X and company Y. Table 18.8 presents the balance sheets for
Carr and its two subsidiaries. Carr owns approximately 17% ($10
$60) of

company X and 20% ($14
$70) of company Y. These holdings are sufficient
for voting control. 
The owners of Carr Company’s $12 worth of equity have control over $260
worth of assets (company X’s $100 worth and company Y’s $160 worth). Thus
the owners’ equity represents only about 4.6% ($12
$260) of the total assets
controlled. From the discussions of ratio analysis, leverage, and capital structure
in Chapters 3 and 13, you should recognize that this is quite a high degree of
leverage. If an individual stockholder or even another holding company owns $3
of Carr Company’s stock, which is assumed to be sufficient for its control, it will
in actuality control the whole $260 of assets. The investment itself in this case
would represent only 1.15% ($3
$260) of the assets controlled.
The high leverage obtained through a holding company arrangement greatly
magnifies earnings and losses for the holding company. Quite often, a pyramiding
of holding companies occurs when one holding company controls other holding
companies, thereby causing an even greater magnification of earnings and losses.
The greater the leverage, the greater the risk involved. The risk–return trade-off is
a key consideration in the holding company decision.
Another commonly cited advantage of holding companies is the risk protec-
tion resulting from the fact that the failure of one of the companies (such as Y in
the preceding example) does not result in the failure of the entire holding com-
pany. Because each subsidiary is a separate corporation, the failure of one com-
pany should cost the holding company, at maximum, no more than its investment
in that subsidiary. Other advantages include the following: (1) Certain state tax

benefits may be realized by each subsidiary in its state of incorporation. (2)
Lawsuits or legal actions against a subsidiary do not threaten the remaining com-
panies. (3) It is generally easy to gain control of a firm, because stockholder or
management approval is not generally necessary.
Disadvantages of Holding Companies
A major disadvantage of holding companies is the increased risk resulting from
the leverage effect. When general economic conditions are unfavorable, a loss by
one subsidiary may be magnified. For example, if subsidiary company X in Table
18.8 experiences a loss, its inability to pay dividends to Carr Company could
result in Carr Company’s inability to meet its scheduled payments.
Another disadvantage is double taxation. Before paying dividends, a sub-
sidiary must pay federal and state taxes on its earnings. Although a 70 percent
tax exclusion is allowed on dividends received by one corporation from another,
the remaining 30 percent received is taxable. (In the event that the holding com-
pany owns between 20 and 80 percent of the stock in a subsidiary, the exclusion
is 80 percent; if it owns more than 80 percent of the stock in the subsidiary, 
100 percent of the dividends are excluded.) If a subsidiary were part of a merged
company, double taxation would not exist.
The fact that holding companies are difficult to analyze is another disadvan-
tage. Security analysts and investors typically have difficulty understanding
holding companies because of their complexity. As a result, these firms tend to
sell at low multiples of earnings (P/Es), and the shareholder value of holding com-
panies may suffer.
A final disadvantage of holding companies is the generally high cost of
administration that results from maintaining each subsidiary company as a sepa-
rate entity. A merger, on the other hand, is likely to result in certain administra-
tive economies of scale. The need for coordination and communication between
the holding company and its subsidiaries may further elevate these costs.
INTERNATIONAL MERGERS
Perhaps in no other area does U.S. financial practice differ more fundamentally
from practices in other countries than in the field of mergers. Outside of the
United States (and, to a lesser degree, Great Britain), hostile takeovers are virtu-
ally nonexistent, and in some countries (such as Japan), takeovers of any kind are
uncommon. The emphasis in the United States and Great Britain on shareholder
value and reliance on public capital markets for financing is generally not shared
by companies in continental Europe. This is because companies there are gener-
ally smaller and because other stakeholders, such as employees, bankers, and
governments, are accorded greater consideration. The U.S. approach is also not
the norm in Japan and other Asian nations.
Changes in Western Europe
Today, there are signs that Western Europe is moving toward a U.S.-style approach
to shareholder value and public capital market financing. Since the European
Union’s (EU’s) economic and monetary union (EMU) integration involving the
introduction of a single European currency, the euro, on January 1, 2002, the
number, size, and importance of cross-border European mergers has continued to
CHAPTER 18
Mergers, LBOs, Divestitures, and Business Failure
735

grow rapidly. Nationally focused companies want to achieve economies of scale
in manufacturing, encourage international product development strategies, and
develop distribution networks across the continent. They are also driven by the need
to compete with U.S. companies, which have been operating on a continent-wide
basis in Europe for decades.
These larger Europe-based companies are expected to become even more for-
midable competitors as more national barriers are removed. Although the vast
majority of these cross-border mergers are friendly in nature, a few have been
actively resisted by target firm managements. It seems clear that as European
companies come to rely more on public capital markets for financing, and as the
market for common stock becomes more truly European in character, rather than
French or British or German, active markets for European corporate equity will
continue to evolve.
Foreign Takeovers of U.S. Companies
Both European and Japanese companies have been active as acquirers of U.S.
companies in recent years. Foreign companies purchased U.S. firms for two
major reasons: to gain access to the world’s single largest, richest, and least reg-
ulated market and to acquire world-class technology. British companies have
been historically the most active acquirers of U.S. firms. In the late 1980s,
Japanese corporations surged to prominence with a series of very large acquisi-
tions, including two in the entertainment industry: Sony’s purchase of Columbia
Pictures and Matsushita’s acquisition of MCA. More recently, German firms
have become especially active acquirers of U.S. companies as producing export
goods in Germany has become prohibitively expensive. (German workers have
some of the world’s highest wages and one of the shortest workweeks.) The
Global Focus box describes recent mergers by Australian media giant News
Corp. It seems inevitable that, in the years ahead, foreign companies will con-
tinue to acquire U.S. firms even as U.S. companies continue to seek attractive
acquisitions abroad.

GLOBAL focus
International Mergers
In July 2005,
Australian-based
media giant News Corp launched a
series of acquisitions involving U.S.
assets. The first was a $580 million
buyout of Intermix Media, owner of
Myspace.com, the fifth most viewed
Internet domain in the United States at
the time. Rupert Murdoch, the media
mogul running News Corp, calculated
that the Myspace networking site would
drive traffic to his Fox TV sites.
Murdoch’s next purchase came in
September 2006, when News Corp
acquired, from Verisign, a majority 
stake in Jamba, which runs Jamster, a
download service for such commodities
as ring tones and screen “wallpapers.”
News Corp’s intent was to hardwire
Fox’s presence in the entire content life-
cycle, from creation, through production,
to delivery on your cell phone screen. It
already had a mobile content provider,
Mobizzo, launched in June 2005 under
the Fox Mobile Entertainment division.
Among the things Mobizzo was
designed to offer were 1-minute
episodes derived from Fox properties
such as its American Idol franchise.
In May 2007, News Corp set its
sight on a new target, Dow Jones,
publisher of The Wall Street Journal and
Barron’s and the owner of other finan-
cial news and content assets including
the Dow Jones Newswires, the finan-
cial website MarketWatch, and several
stock market indicators (for example,
the Dow Jones Industrial Average).
Murdoch’s News Corp bid $5 billion
for Dow Jones but faced resistance from
members of the Bancroft family—
descendents of Clarence Barron, the
“father of financial journalism”—which
controls more than 50 percent of the
voting power in the company. The
News Corp bid was remarkable for its
premium, which would value Dow
Jones at more than double its trading
value prior to the bid.
International mergers, such as the
ones pursued by News Corp, are not
as easy to execute as domestic merg-
ers. Complicating matters are multiple
legal and regulatory regimes, cultural
differences, and complex timing
requirements involving simultaneously
closing the deal in multiple jurisdictions.
Further complications may arise from a
potential distrust of employees or own-
ers from another country. In the Dow
Jones case, the Dow Jones board and
the Bancroft family sought to negotiate
some level of independence for the
Journal so that it may remain free of
corporate interference.
Ultimately, Rupert Murdoch would
have his way. On December 13,
2007, News Corp announced the
completion of its acquisition of Dow
Jones. The terms of the merger agree-
ment provided that each share of Dow
Jones common stock was entitled to
receive, at the election of the holder,
either $60.00 in cash or 2.8681
share of Class B common units of Ruby
Newco LLC, a wholly owned sub-
sidiary of News Corp. Ruby Newco
Class B common units are convertible
after a period of time into a share of
News Corp Class A common stock.
On completion of the merger, Dow
Jones became a wholly owned sub-
sidiary of Ruby Newco and Natalie
Bancroft was appointed to the
Company’s Board of Directors.

Dow Jones, what trade-offs would

18.4 Business Failure Fundamentals
A business failure is an unfortunate circumstance. Although the majority of firms
that fail do so within the first year or two of life, other firms grow, mature, and
fail much later. The failure of a business can be viewed in a number of ways and
can result from one or more causes.
TYPES OF BUSINESS FAILURE
A firm may fail because its returns are negative or low. A firm that consistently
reports operating losses will probably experience a decline in market value. If the
firm fails to earn a return that is greater than its cost of capital, it can be viewed
as having failed. Negative or low returns, unless remedied, are likely to result
eventually in one of the following more serious types of failure.
LG 5

A second type of failure, insolvency, occurs when a firm is unable to pay its
liabilities as they come due. When a firm is insolvent, its assets are still greater
than its liabilities, but it is confronted with a liquidity crisis. If some of its assets
can be converted into cash within a reasonable period, the company may be able
to escape complete failure. If not, the result is the third and most serious type of
failure, bankruptcy.
Bankruptcy occurs when the stated value of a firm’s liabilities exceeds the fair
market value of its assets. A bankrupt firm has a negative stockholders’ equity.4
This means that the claims of creditors cannot be satisfied unless the firm’s assets
can be liquidated for more than their book value. Although bankruptcy is an
obvious form of failure, the courts treat insolvency and bankruptcy in the same
way. They are both considered to indicate the financial failure of the firm.
MAJOR CAUSES OF BUSINESS FAILURE
The primary cause of business failure is mismanagement, which accounts for
more than 50 percent of all cases. Numerous specific managerial faults can cause
the firm to fail. Overexpansion, poor financial actions, an ineffective sales force,
and high production costs can all singly or in combination cause failure. For
example, poor financial actions include bad capital budgeting decisions (based on
unrealistic sales and cost forecasts, failure to identify all relevant cash flows, or
failure to assess risk properly), poor financial evaluation of the firm’s strategic
plans prior to making financial commitments, inadequate or nonexistent cash
flow planning, and failure to control receivables and inventories. Because all
major corporate decisions are eventually measured in terms of dollars, the finan-
cial manager may play a key role in avoiding or causing a business failure. It is his
or her duty to monitor the firm’s financial pulse. For example, Enron Corporation’s
early 2002 bankruptcy (the largest ever) was attributed mainly to questionable
partnerships set up by Enron’s CFO, Andrew Fastow. Those partnerships were
intended to hide Enron’s debt, inflate its profits, and enrich its top management.
In late 2001, these transactions lost large amounts of money, causing the corpo-
ration to file bankruptcy and resulting in criminal charges against Enron’s key
executives as well as its auditor, Arthur Andersen, which failed to accurately dis-
close Enron’s financial condition.
Economic activity—especially economic downturns—can contribute to the
failure of a firm.5 If the economy goes into a recession, sales may decrease
abruptly, leaving the firm with high fixed costs and insufficient revenues to cover
them. Rapid rises in interest rates just prior to a recession can further contribute
to cash flow problems and make it more difficult for the firm to obtain and main-
tain needed financing.
A final cause of business failure is corporate maturity. Firms, like individuals,
do not have infinite lives. Like a product, a firm goes through the stages of birth,

4. Because on a balance sheet the firm’s assets equal the sum of its liabilities and stockholders’ equity, the only way
a firm that has more liabilities than assets can balance its balance sheet is to have a negative stockholders’ equity.
5. The success of some firms runs countercyclical to economic activity, and other firms are unaffected by economic
activity. For example, the auto repair business is likely to grow during a recession because people are less likely to
buy new cars and therefore need more repairs on their unwarrantied older cars. The sales of boats and other luxury
items may decline during a recession, whereas sales of staple items such as electricity are likely to be unaffected. In
terms of beta—the measure of nondiversifiable risk developed in Chapter 8—a negative-beta stock would be associ-
ated with a firm whose behavior is generally countercyclical to economic activity.

growth, maturity, and eventual decline. The firm’s management should attempt
to prolong the growth stage through research, new products, and mergers. Once
the firm has matured and has begun to decline, it should seek to be acquired by
another firm or liquidate before it fails. Effective management planning should
help the firm to postpone decline and ultimate failure.
VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENTS
When a firm becomes insolvent or bankrupt, it may arrange with its creditors a
voluntary settlement, which enables it to bypass many of the costs involved in
legal bankruptcy proceedings. The settlement is normally initiated by the debtor
firm, because such an arrangement may enable it to continue to exist or to be liq-
uidated in a manner that gives the owners the greatest chance of recovering part
of their investment. The debtor arranges a meeting between itself and all its cred-
itors. At the meeting, a committee of creditors is selected to analyze the debtor’s
situation and recommend a plan of action. The recommendations of the com-
mittee are discussed with both the debtor and the creditors, and a plan for sus-
taining or liquidating the firm is drawn up.
Voluntary Settlement to Sustain the Firm
Normally, the rationale for sustaining a firm depends on whether the firm’s
recovery is feasible. By sustaining the firm, the creditor can continue to receive

focus on ETHICS
Too Big to Fail?
”What’s good for
General Motors is
good for America.” That quote, often
attributed to Charlie Wilson, Chairman
and CEO of General Motors (GM)
from 1941 to 1953, is meant to con-
vey the importance of GM to the U.S.
economy. For most of the second half
of the twentieth century, GM ranked as
the largest corporation by market capi-
talization in the United States. At the
company’s peak in the 1970s, it
employed nearly 400,000 factory
workers. Many more were employed
by the company’s financing sub-
sidiaries, suppliers, retailers, and other
ancillary businesses.
However, by the end of the first
decade of the new millennium, GM’s
fortunes had changed. The company,
which at one time manufactured one of
every two cars sold in the United
States, was being challenged for the
top spot by Toyota. GM was slow to
adjust to shifting consumer demands
and found itself bloated and saddled
with pension and health care commit-
ments to retirees estimated at $2,000
per car sold. In 2008, recession struck,
and total U.S. vehicle sales dropped
by almost 20 percent. GM fell into a
tailspin and, on June 1, 2009, filed for
bankruptcy protection. Aware of the
company’s importance to their
economies, the U.S. and Canadian
governments provided financial support
and received ownership stakes of 60
percent and 12.5 percent, respectively.
The government bailout raises an
interesting ethical dilemma. When a
company becomes too big to fail, how
might its financial managers’ decisions
change when they can count on gov-
ernment support if a crisis arises? Some
suggest that an implicit government
backstop encourages firms to take out-
sized risks. Essentially, because the
government guarantee protects a firm
on the downside, it tempts the firm to
take greater risks with the potential for
greater rewards. Unfortunately, guaran-
tees are not free, as taxpayers may
soon find out.

business from it. A number of strategies are commonly used. An extension is an
arrangement whereby the firm’s creditors receive payment in full, although not
immediately. Normally, when creditors grant an extension, they require the firm
to make cash payments for purchases until all past debts have been paid. A
second arrangement, called composition, is a pro rata cash settlement of creditor
claims. Instead of receiving full payment of their claims, creditors receive only a
partial payment. A uniform percentage of each dollar owed is paid in satisfaction
of each creditor’s claim.
A third arrangement is creditor control. In this case, the creditor committee
may decide that maintaining the firm is feasible only if the operating management
is replaced. The committee may then take control of the firm and operate it until
all claims have been settled. Sometimes, a plan involving some combination of
extension, composition, and creditor control will result. An example of this is a
settlement whereby the debtor agrees to pay a total of 75 cents on the dollar in
three annual installments of 25 cents on the dollar, and the creditors agree to sell
additional merchandise to the firm on 30-day terms if the existing management is
replaced by new management that is acceptable to them.
Voluntary Settlement Resulting in Liquidation
After the situation of the firm has been investigated by the creditor committee,
the only acceptable course of action may be liquidation of the firm. Liquidation
can be carried out in two ways—privately or through the legal procedures pro-
vided by bankruptcy law. If the debtor firm is willing to accept liquidation, legal
procedures may not be required. Generally, the avoidance of litigation enables the
creditors to obtain quicker and higher settlements. However, all the creditors
must agree to a private liquidation for it to be feasible.
The objective of the voluntary liquidation process is to recover as much per
dollar owed as possible. Under voluntary liquidation, common stockholders (the
firm’s true owners) cannot receive any funds until the claims of all other parties
have been satisfied. A common procedure is to have a meeting of the creditors at
which they make an assignment by passing the power to liquidate the firm’s
assets to an adjustment bureau, a trade association, or a third party, which is des-
ignated the assignee. The assignee’s job is to liquidate the assets, obtaining the
best price possible. The assignee is sometimes referred to as the trustee because it
is entrusted with the title to the company’s assets and the responsibility to liqui-
date them efficiently. Once the trustee has liquidated the assets, it distributes the
recovered funds to the creditors and owners (if any funds remain for the owners).
The final action in a private liquidation is for the creditors to sign a release
attesting to the satisfactory settlement of their claims.

BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION
Bankruptcy in the legal sense occurs when the firm cannot pay its bills or when
its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets. In either case, a firm
may be declared legally bankrupt. However, creditors generally attempt to
avoid forcing a firm into bankruptcy if it appears to have opportunities for
future success.
The governing bankruptcy legislation in the United States today is the
Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, which significantly modified earlier bankruptcy
legislation. This law contains eight odd-numbered chapters (1 through 15) and
one even-numbered chapter (12). A number of these chapters would apply in the
instance of failure; the two key ones are Chapters 7 and 11. Chapter 7 of the
Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 details the procedures to be followed when liq-
uidating a failed firm. Chapter 7 typically comes into play once it has been deter-
mined that a fair, equitable, and feasible basis for the reorganization of a failed

REORGANIZATION IN BANKRUPTCY (CHAPTER 11)
There are two basic types of reorganization petitions—voluntary and involun-
tary. Any firm that is not a municipal or financial institution can file a petition for
voluntary reorganization on its own behalf.6 Involuntary reorganization is initi-
ated by an outside party, usually a creditor. An involuntary petition against a firm
can be filed if one of three conditions is met:
1. The firm has past-due debts of $5,000 or more.
2. Three or more creditors can prove that they have aggregate unpaid claims of
$5,000 against the firm. If the firm has fewer than 12 creditors, any creditor
that is owed more than $5,000 can file the petition.
3. The firm is insolvent, which means that (a) it is not paying its debts as they
come due, (b) within the preceding 120 days a custodian (a third party) was
appointed or took possession of the debtor’s property, or (c) the fair market
value of the firm’s assets is less than the stated value of its liabilities.
Procedures
A reorganization petition under Chapter 11 must be filed in a federal bankruptcy
court. On the filing of this petition, the filing firm becomes the debtor in possession
(DIP) of the assets. If creditors object to the filing firm being the debtor in posses-
sion, they can ask the judge to appoint a trustee. After reviewing the firm’s situa-
tion, the debtor in possession submits a plan of reorganization and a disclosure
statement summarizing the plan to the court. A hearing is held to determine
whether the plan is fair, equitable, and feasible and whether the disclosure state-
ment contains adequate information. The court’s approval or disapproval is
based on its evaluation of the plan in light of these standards. A plan is consid-
ered fair and equitable if it maintains the priorities of the contractual claims of
the creditors, preferred stockholders, and common stockholders. The court must
also find the reorganization plan feasible, which means that it must be workable.
The reorganized corporation must have sufficient working capital, enough funds
to cover fixed charges, adequate credit prospects, and the ability to retire or
refund debts as proposed by the plan.
Once approved, the plan and the disclosure statement are given to the firm’s
creditors and shareholders for their acceptance. Under the Bankruptcy Reform
Act, creditors and owners are separated into groups with similar types of claims.
In the case of creditor groups, approval of the plan is required by holders of at
least two-thirds of the dollar amount of claims, as well as by a numerical majority
of creditors. In the case of ownership groups (preferred and common stock-
holders), two-thirds of the shares in each group must approve the reorganization
plan for it to be accepted. Once accepted and confirmed by the court, the plan is
put into effect as soon as possible.
Individuals, like corporations, sometimes fail financially.
Typically, a lack of financial planning, a heavy debt load, or an
economic recession are factors that cause debtors to start missing payments and

6. Firms sometimes file a voluntary petition to obtain temporary legal protection from creditors or from prolonged
litigation. Once they have straightened out their financial or legal affairs—prior to further reorganization or liqui-
dation actions—they will have the petition dismissed. Although such actions are not the intent of the bankruptcy
law, difficulty in enforcing the law has allowed this abuse to occur.

experiencing deterioration in their credit ratings. Unless they take corrective
action, repossession of debt-financed property and eventually personal bank-
ruptcy will follow. Individuals in dire financial straits have two legal options: a
wage earner plan or straight bankruptcy.
A wage earner plan, defined under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code,
is a “work-out” procedure that involves some type of debt restructuring—
typically establishing a debt-repayment schedule that is workable in light of the
individual’s personal income. This is similar to reorganization in a corporate
bankruptcy. A majority of creditors must agree to this plan, under which interest
payments and late fees are waived during the repayment period. If approved, the
individual, who retains the use of and title to all assets, makes payments to the
court, which then pays off all creditors.
Straight bankruptcy is allowed under Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code. It is
a legal procedure, similar to liquidation in corporate bankruptcy, that effectively
allows the debtor to “wipe the slate clean and start anew.” However straight
bankruptcy does not eliminate all of a debtor’s obligations, nor does the debtor
lose all of his or her assets. For example, the debtor must make certain tax pay-
ments and keep up alimony and child-support payments but can retain certain
payments from Social Security, retirement, and disability benefits. Depending on
state law, the debtor can retain a certain amount of equity in a home, a car, and
other assets.
Role of the Debtor in Possession (DIP)
Because reorganization activities are largely in the hands of the debtor in posses-
sion (DIP), it is useful to understand the DIP’s responsibilities. The DIP’s first
responsibility is the valuation of the firm to determine whether reorganization is
appropriate. To do this, the DIP must estimate both the liquidation value of the
business and its value as a going concern. If the firm’s value as a going concern is
less than its liquidation value, the DIP will recommend liquidation. If the oppo-
site is found to be true, the DIP will recommend reorganization, and a plan of
reorganization must be drawn up.
The key portion of the reorganization plan generally concerns the firm’s cap-
ital structure. Because most firms’ financial difficulties result from high fixed
charges, the company’s capital structure is generally recapitalized to reduce these
charges. Under recapitalization, debts are generally exchanged for equity or the
maturities of existing debts are extended. When recapitalizing the firm, the DIP
seeks to build a mix of debt and equity that will allow the firm to meet its debts
and provide a reasonable level of earnings for its owners.
Once the revised capital structure has been determined, the DIP must establish
a plan for exchanging outstanding obligations for new securities. The guiding
principle is to observe priorities. Senior claims (those with higher legal priority)
must be satisfied before junior claims (those with lower legal priority). To comply
with this principle, senior suppliers of capital must receive a claim on new capital
equal to their previous claim. The common stockholders are the last to receive any
new securities. (It is not unusual for them to receive nothing.) Security holders do
not necessarily have to receive the same type of security they held before; often
they receive a combination of securities. Once the debtor in possession has deter-
mined the new capital structure and distribution of capital, it will submit the reor-
ganization plan and disclosure statement to the court as described.

LIQUIDATION IN BANKRUPTCY (CHAPTER 7)
The liquidation of a bankrupt firm usually occurs once the bankruptcy court has
determined that reorganization is not feasible. A petition for reorganization must
normally be filed by the managers or creditors of the bankrupt firm. If no petition
is filed, if a petition is filed and denied, or if the reorganization plan is denied, the
firm must be liquidated.
Procedures
When a firm is adjudged bankrupt, the judge may appoint a trustee to perform the
many routine duties required in administering the bankruptcy. The trustee takes
charge of the property of the bankrupt firm and protects the interest of its creditors.
A meeting of creditors must be held between 20 and 40 days after the bankruptcy
judgment. At this meeting, the creditors are made aware of the prospects for the liq-
uidation. The trustee is given the responsibility to liquidate the firm, keep records,
examine creditors’ claims, disburse money, furnish information as required, and
make final reports on the liquidation. In essence, the trustee is responsible for the
liquidation of the firm. Occasionally, the court will call subsequent creditor meet-
ings, but only a final meeting for closing the bankruptcy is required.
Priority of Claims
It is the trustee’s responsibility to liquidate all the firm’s assets and to distribute
the proceeds to the holders of provable claims. The courts have established cer-
tain procedures for determining the provability of claims. The priority of claims,
which is specified in Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Reform Act, must be main-
tained by the trustee when distributing the funds from liquidation. Any secured
creditors have specific assets pledged as collateral and, in liquidation, receive pro-
ceeds from the sale of those assets. If these proceeds are inadequate to fully satisfy
their claims, the secured creditors become unsecured, or general, creditors for the
unrecovered amount, because specific collateral no longer exists. These and all
other unsecured creditors will divide up, on a pro rata basis, any funds remaining
after all prior claims have been satisfied. If the proceeds from the sale of secured
assets are in excess of the claims against them, the excess funds become available
to meet claims of unsecured creditors.
The complete order of priority of claims is given in Table 18.9. In spite of the
priorities listed in items 1 through 7, secured creditors have first claim on pro-
ceeds from the sale of their collateral. The claims of unsecured creditors,
including the unpaid claims of secured creditors, are satisfied next, and then,
finally, the claims of preferred and common stockholders.
Final Accounting
After the trustee has liquidated all the bankrupt firm’s assets and distributed the
proceeds to satisfy all provable claims in the appropriate order of priority, he or
she makes a final accounting to the bankruptcy court and creditors. Once the
court approves the final accounting, the liquidation is complete.

TABLE 18.9
Summary
FOCUS ON VALUE
The financial manager is sometimes involved in corporate restructuring activi-
ties, which involve the expansion and contraction of the firm’s operations or
changes in its asset or ownership structure. A variety of motives could drive a
firm toward a merger, but the overriding goal should be maximization of the
owners’ wealth. Occasionally, merger transactions are heavily debt-financed
leveraged buyouts (LBOs). In other cases, firms attempt to improve value by

divesting themselves of certain operating units that they believe constrain the
firm’s value, particularly when the breakup value is believed to be greater than
the firm’s current value.
Whether the firm makes a cash purchase or uses a stock swap to acquire
another firm, the risk-adjusted net present value of the transaction should be
positive. In stock swap transactions, the long-run impact on the firm’s earn-
ings and risk can be evaluated to estimate the acquiring firm’s postacquisition
value. Only in cases where additional value is created should the transaction
be undertaken.
Business failure, though unpleasant, must be treated similarly; a failing firm
should be reorganized only when such an act will maximize the owners’ wealth.
Otherwise, liquidation should be pursued in a fashion that allows the owners
the greatest amount of recovery. Regardless of whether the firm is growing, con-
tracting, or being reorganized or liquidated in bankruptcy, the firm should take
action only when that action is believed to result in a positive contribution to
the maximization of the owners’ wealth.
REVIEW OF LEARNING GOALS
Understand merger fundamentals, including terminology, motives for
merging, and types of mergers. Mergers result from the combining of firms.
Typically, the acquiring company pursues and attempts to merge with the target
company, on either a friendly or a hostile basis. Mergers are undertaken either
for strategic reasons to achieve economies of scale or for financial reasons to
restructure the firm to improve its cash flow. The overriding goal of merging is
maximization of share price. Other specific merger motives include growth or
diversification, synergy, fund raising, increased managerial skill or technology,
tax considerations, increased ownership liquidity, and defense against takeover.
The four basic types of mergers are horizontal, vertical, congeneric, and con-
glomerate.
Describe the objectives and procedures used in leveraged buyouts
(LBOs) and divestitures. LBOs involve use of a large amount of debt to pur-
chase a firm. Divestiture involves the sale of a firm’s assets, typically an 
operating unit; the spin-off of assets into an independent company; or the 
liquidation of assets. Motives for divestiture include cash generation and cor-
porate restructuring.
Demonstrate the procedures used to value the target company, and dis-
cuss the effect of stock swap transactions on earnings per share. The value of a
target company can be estimated by applying capital budgeting techniques to
the relevant cash flows. All proposed mergers with positive net present values
are considered acceptable. In a stock swap transaction, a ratio of exchange must
be established to measure the amount paid per share of the target company 
relative to the per-share market price of the acquiring firm. The resulting rela-
tionship between the price/earnings (P/E) ratio paid by the acquiring firm 
and its initial P/E affects the merged firm’s earnings per share (EPS) and 
market price. If the P/E paid is greater than the P/E of the acquiring company,
the EPS of the acquiring company decrease and the EPS of the target company
increase.

Discuss the merger negotiation process, holding companies, and
international mergers. Acquirers commonly hire investment bankers to find a
suitable target company and assist in negotiations. A merger can be negoti-
ated with the target firm’s management or, in the case of a hostile merger,
directly with the firm’s shareholders by using tender offers. Management of
the target firm can employ various takeover defenses—a white knight,
poison pill, greenmail, leveraged recapitalization, golden parachutes, and
shark repellents. A holding company can be created by one firm gaining con-
trol of other companies, often by owning as little as 10 to 20 percent of their
stock. The chief advantages of holding companies are the leverage effect, risk
protection, tax benefits, protection against lawsuits, and the ease of gaining
control of a subsidiary. Disadvantages include increased risk due to the mag-
nification of losses, double taxation, difficulty of analysis, and the high cost
of administration. Today, mergers of companies in Western Europe have
moved toward the U.S.-style approach to shareholder value and public cap-
ital market financing. Both European and Japanese companies have become
active acquirers of U.S. firms.
Understand the types and major causes of business failure and the use of
voluntary settlements to sustain or liquidate the failed firm. A firm may fail
because it has negative or low returns, is insolvent, or is bankrupt. The major
causes of business failure are mismanagement, downturns in economic activity,
and corporate maturity. Voluntary settlements are initiated by the debtor and
can result in sustaining the firm via an extension, a composition, creditor con-
trol of the firm, or a combination of these strategies. If creditors do not agree to
a plan to sustain a firm, they may recommend voluntary liquidation, which
bypasses many of the legal requirements and costs of bankruptcy proceedings.
Explain bankruptcy legislation and the procedures involved in reorgan-
izing or liquidating a bankrupt firm. A failed firm can voluntarily or involun-
tarily file in federal bankruptcy court for reorganization under Chapter 11 or
for liquidation under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978. Under
Chapter 11, the judge will appoint the debtor in possession, which develops a
reorganization plan. A firm that cannot be reorganized under Chapter 11 or
does not petition for reorganization is liquidated under Chapter 7. The responsi-
bility for liquidation is placed in the hands of a court-appointed trustee, whose
duties include liquidating assets, distributing the proceeds, and making a final
accounting. Liquidation procedures follow a priority of claims for distribution
of the proceeds from the sale of assets.

viability of a business unit and decide whether to retain it within the corporation or
divest it. The selling of units that do not seem to “fit” should bring about greater
synergy for the firm. This same logic can be applied in a personal finance situation
as well. An important question that comes up for families with two working parents
and young children is whether one of the working adults should stay at home or
whether the family should use day-care services.
Assume that Ted and Maggie Smith have two young children who need child-
care services. Currently, Maggie is a stay-at-home mother but could go back to her
former job as a marketing analyst. She estimates that she could earn $3,800 per
month gross, including her employer’s 401(k) contributions. She will receive
monthly employer-paid benefits that include health insurance, life insurance, and
pension contributions totaling $1,200.
Maggie expects her federal and state income taxes to total about $1,300 per
month. The Smiths have calculated that total additional expenses such as child care,
clothing, personal expenses, meals away from home, and transportation related to
Maggie’s job could total $1,400 per month.
Does it make economic sense for the Smiths to hire child care and have Maggie
return to work? To answer this question, calculate the net income or loss from her
possible return to work.

Personal Finance Problem

Bankruptcy legislation—wage-earner plan
Jon Morgan is in a financial position
where he owes more than he earns each month. Due to his lack of financial planning
and a heavy debt load, Jon started missing payments and saw his credit rating
plunge. Unless corrective action is taken, personal bankruptcy will follow.
Jon recently contacted his lawyer in order to set up a wage earner plan with his
creditors and establish a debt repayment schedule that is workable in light of his
personal income. His creditors have all agreed to a plan under which interest pay-
ments and late fees will be waived during the repayment period. The process would
have Jon make payments to the court, which then will pay off his creditors.
Jon has outstanding debt of $28,000. His creditors have set a repayment period
of 4 years during which monthly principal payments are required. They have waived
all interest charges and late fees. Jon’s yearly take-home income is $30,600.

Why This Chapter Matters to You
In your professional life
ACCOUNTING You need to understand the tax rules for multinational
companies, how to prepare consolidated financial statements for sub-
sidiary companies, and how to account for international items in finan-
cial statements.
INFORMATION SYSTEMS You need to understand that if the firm
undertakes foreign operations, it will need systems that track invest-
ments and operations in another currency and their fluctuations against
the domestic currency.
MANAGEMENT You need to understand both the opportunities and
the risks involved in international operations, the possible role of inter-
national financial markets in raising capital, and the basic hedging
strategies that multinational companies can use to protect themselves
against exchange rate risk.
MARKETING You need to understand the potential for expanding into
international markets and the ways of doing so (exports, foreign direct
investment, mergers, and joint ventures); also, you should know how
investment cash flows in foreign projects will be measured.
OPERATIONS You need to understand the costs and benefits of moving
operations offshore and/or buying equipment, parts, and inventory in
foreign markets. Such an understanding will allow you to participate in
the firm’s decisions with regard to international operations.
Your direct involvement in the global
marketplace is most likely to result
from expenditures made during foreign travel. In addition, you may
invest directly or indirectly (via mutual funds) in the stocks of foreign
companies. Probably the greatest personal benefit gained from this
chapter is an understanding of exchange rates, which can significantly
impact foreign expenditures, purchases, and investment returns.

Establishing a Presence in China
G
eneral Electric Co., one of the world’s largest
firms, considers globalization one of its core
competencies. In 2009, almost 54 percent, or 
$84.3 billion, of GE’s total revenues was generated
outside of the United States. GE believes that global
growth requires more than simply shipping products. A
global company must be equally committed to devel-
oping capabilities and relationships in the markets
where it wants to succeed.
One of GE’s markets is China, where its revenues totaled $5 billion in 2006. China will
invest $400 billion for infrastructure in this decade. The 2008 Olympics in Beijing was one of
its massive infrastructure projects, and GE was a major player in helping China prepare for the
games. To support its Chinese customers, GE had more than 1,700 sales and service people on
the ground in China. It built a Global Research Center in Shanghai to develop the capabilities
of its Chinese suppliers. GE has also trained Chinese business leaders in GE management 
techniques.
GE paid nearly $200 million to become an Olympic sponsor. The hefty sponsorship fee
covers four Olympic Games through 2012, but GE was particularly interested in playing a role
in Beijing. It targeted about $1 billion in Olympics-related contracts to provide everything from
lighting and security at stadiums to electrical equipment at subway stations, treatment systems at
wastewater facilities, and ultrasound equipment for diagnosing athletes’ ailments. GE’s goal was
to double its revenue in China to $10 billion by 2010.
GE created a team of 100 engineers and salespeople in Beijing to work on Olympics-
related projects. It then broke them up into smaller groups focusing on the Beijing Olympic
Committee, Chinese companies developing the stadiums, and the government agencies in
charge of transportation. As an Olympic sponsor in several categories, GE provided specific
services during the games. Company officials said the company was bidding on 25 to 
30 contracts a month.
Like GE, many companies are looking beyond their home country’s borders for new
market opportunities. Although globalization can bring controversy, companies like GE believe
that future growth requires U.S. companies to view the world as their market.

19.1 The Multinational Company 
and Its Environment
In recent years, as world markets have become more interdependent, interna-
tional finance has become an increasingly important element in the management
of multinational companies (MNCs). Since World War II, an increasing number
of firms, including many based in emerging or developing countries, have become
MNCs (also referred to as global firms or transnational corporations) by devel-
oping targeted overseas markets, mainly through foreign direct investment
(FDI)—that is, by establishing foreign subsidiaries or affiliates—and via mergers
and acquisitions. The principles of managerial finance in this text apply to the
management of MNCs as well as to purely domestic firms. However, certain fac-
tors unique to the international setting tend to complicate the financial manage-
ment of multinational companies. A simple comparison between a domestic U.S.
firm (firm A) and a U.S.-based MNC (firm B), as illustrated in Table 19.1, indi-
cates the influence of some of the international factors on MNCs’ operations.
Multinationals face a variety of laws and restrictions when operating in dif-
ferent nation-states. The legal and economic complexities existing in this envi-
ronment are significantly different from those a domestic firm would face. Here
we take a brief look at that environment, starting with key trading blocs.
KEY TRADING BLOCS
In late 1992, the presidents of the United States and Mexico and the prime min-
ister of Canada signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The
U.S. Congress ratified NAFTA in November 1993. This trade pact simply mirrors
underlying economic reality—Canada and Mexico are among the largest U.S.
trading partners. In 2003–2004, the United States signed a bilateral trade deal

O
ne of the reasons why
firms have operations in
foreign markets is the portfolio
concept discussed in Chapter
8. Just as it is not wise for you
to put all of your investment
into the stock of one firm, it is
not wise for a firm to invest in
only one market. By having
operations in many markets,
firms can smooth out some of
the cyclic changes that occur
in each market.

with Chile and also a regional pact, known as the Central American Free Trade
Agreement (CAFTA), with the Dominican Republic and five Central American
countries (Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua). Since
1985, the United States has signed bilateral and regional trade agreements with
more than 62 other nations.
The European Union, or EU, has been in existence since 1957. It has a cur-
rent membership of 27 nations. With a total population estimated at more than
470 million (compared to the U.S. population of about 300 million) and an
overall gross national income paralleling that of the United States, the EU is a sig-
nificant global economic force. The countries of Western Europe opened a new
era of free trade within the union when intraregional tariff barriers fell at the end
of 1992. This transformation is commonly called the European Open Market.
Although the EU has managed to reach agreement on most economic, monetary,
financial, and legal provisions, debates continue on certain other aspects (some
key), including those related to automobile production and imports, monetary
union, taxes, and workers’ rights.
As a result of the Maastricht Treaty of 1991, 12 EU nations adopted a single
currency, the euro, as a continent-wide medium of exchange. And beginning
January 1, 2002, those 12 EU nations switched to a single set of euro bills and
coins, causing the national currencies of all 12 countries participating in
monetary union to slowly disappear in the following months. As of 2007, 13
members were using the euro as their national currency.
At the same time that the European Union implemented monetary union,
(which also involved creating a new European Central Bank), the EU experienced
a wave of new applicants, resulting in the May 1, 2004, admission of ten and the
January 1, 2007, admission of two new members from Eastern Europe and the
Mediterranean region. The rapidly emerging new community of Europe offers
both challenges and opportunities to a variety of players, including multina-
tional firms. MNCs today face heightened levels of competition when operating
inside the EU. As more of the existing restrictions and regulations are elimi-
nated, for instance, U.S. multinationals will have to face other MNCs, some
from within the EU itself.
In addition to NAFTA and the EU, a number of other bilateral or regional
trading blocs have emerged. The EU itself has entered into trade accords
involving at least 35 countries. Latin America has several such blocs, including its
largest, Mercosur, which is composed of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay,
and Venezuela. It has a population of more than 250 million and a combined eco-
nomic size of about US$1.1 trillion. An even larger bloc exists in the form of
ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), with ten members. China has
signed a trade deal with ASEAN, to be phased in by 2010. This will create a
regional free market encompassing more than 1.8 billion people by 2015. Other
trading agreements involving Japan, India, South Korea, Singapore, Australia,
New Zealand, and various nations in Africa either have been completed or are
under negotiation.
These deals will result in an increasing share of world trade being covered by
regional accords. Meanwhile, an unintended consequence is the emergence of
contradictions and incompatibilities vis-á-vis the multilateral-based system
embedded in WTO (discussed in the next section). All of this will force the multi-
nationals to navigate through a rising number of trade agreements worldwide.
Despite the challenges, though, U.S. companies can benefit from the formation of

regional and bilateral trade pacts, but only if they are prepared to exploit them.
They must offer a desirable mix of products to a collection of varied consumers
and be ready to take advantage of a variety of currencies and of financial markets
and instruments (such as the Euroequities discussed later in this chapter). They
must staff their operations with the appropriate combination of local and foreign
personnel and, when necessary, enter into joint ventures and strategic alliances.
GATT AND THE WTO
Although it may seem that the world is splitting into a handful of trading blocs,
this is less of a danger than it may appear to be, because many international
treaties are in force that guarantee relatively open access to at least the largest
economies. The most important such treaty is the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT). In 1994, Congress ratified the most recent version of this
treaty, which has governed world trade throughout most of the postwar era. The
current agreement extends free-trading rules to broad areas of economic activity—
such as agriculture, financial services, and intellectual property rights—that had
not previously been covered by international treaty and were thus effectively off-
limits to foreign competition.
The 1994 GATT treaty also established a new international body, the World
Trade Organization (WTO), to police world trading practices and to mediate dis-
putes between member countries. The WTO began operating in January 1995. In
2004, preliminary approvals were granted for an eventual membership of the
Russian Federation in the WTO. In December 2001, the People’s Republic of
China was, after years of controversy, granted membership. As of 2007, the
WTO had 151 members. Given the emergence of more bilateral and regional
trade accords, however, its long-term prospects and effectiveness are becoming
increasingly clouded. Key evidence was the organization’s lack of achieving final
agreement by 2007 on the global round of trade negotiations, the Doha Round,
which began in 2001.
LEGAL FORMS OF BUSINESS ORGANIZATION
In many countries outside the United States, operating a foreign business as a
subsidiary or affiliate can take two forms, both similar to the U.S. corporation. In
German-speaking nations the two forms are the Aktiengesellschaft (A.G.) or the
Gesellschaft mit beschrankter Haftung (GmbH). In many other countries the sim-
ilar forms are a Société Anonyme (S.A.) or a Société à Responsibilité Limitée
(S.A.R.L.). The A.G. and the S.A. are the most common forms, but the GmbH
and the S.A.R.L. require fewer formalities for formation and operation.
Establishing a business in a form such as the S.A. can involve most of the pro-
visions that govern a U.S.-based corporation. In addition, to operate in many for-
eign countries it is often essential to enter into joint-venture business agreements
with private investors or with government-based agencies of the host country. A
joint venture is a partnership under which the participants have contractually
agreed to contribute specified amounts of money and expertise in exchange for
stated proportions of ownership and profit. Joint ventures are common in many
emerging and developing nations.
Emerging and developing countries have varying laws and regulations regarding
MNCs’ subsidiary and joint-venture operations. Whereas many host countries

(including Mexico, Brazil, South Korea, and Taiwan) have either completely
removed or significantly liberalized their local-ownership requirements, other
major economies (including China and India) are just beginning to relax these
restrictions. China, for instance, has gradually opened up new economic sectors
and industries to partial (and, in a few cases, full) foreign participation. India
continues to insist on majority local ownership in wide-ranging segments of its
economy. MNCs, especially those based in the United States, the EU, and Japan,
will face new challenges and opportunities in the future in terms of ownership
requirements, mergers, and acquisitions.
The existence of joint-venture laws and restrictions has implications for the
operation of foreign-based subsidiaries. First, majority foreign ownership may
result in a substantial degree of management and control by host country partici-
pants. This, in turn, can influence day-to-day operations to the detriment of the
managerial policies and procedures MNCs normally pursue. Next, foreign own-
ership may result in disagreements among the partners as to the exact distribu-
tion of profits and the portion to be allocated for reinvestment. Moreover,
operating in foreign countries, especially on a joint-venture basis, can involve
problems regarding the remittance of profits. In the past, the governments of
Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, and Thailand, among others, have imposed ceilings
not only on the repatriation (return) of capital by MNCs but also on profit remit-
tances by these firms to the parent companies. These governments usually cite the
shortage of foreign exchange as the motivating factor. Finally, from a “positive”
point of view, it can be argued that MNCs operating in many of the less devel-
oped countries benefit from joint-venture agreements, given the potential risks
stemming from political instability in the host countries. This issue will be
addressed in detail in subsequent discussions.
TAXES
Multinational companies, unlike domestic firms, have financial obligations in
foreign countries. One of their basic responsibilities is international taxation—a
complex issue because national governments follow a variety of tax policies. In
general, U.S.-based MNCs must take into account several factors.
Tax Rates and Taxable Income
First, MNCs need to examine the level of foreign taxes. Among the major indus-
trial countries, corporate tax rates do vary. While the average rates in the United
States, Germany, and Japan are close to 40 percent, those in the United Kingdom
and Australia are near 30 percent. Ireland has a rate of about 12 percent. Many
less industrialized nations maintain relatively moderate rates, partly as an incen-
tive for attracting foreign capital. Certain countries—in particular, the Bahamas,
Switzerland, Liechtenstein, the Cayman Islands, and Bermuda—are known for
their low tax levels. As discussed in the Global Focus box in Chapter 11, China
has had a low rate for foreign investors, to encourage investment. These nations
typically have no withholding taxes on intra-MNC dividends.
Next, there is a question as to the definition of taxable income. Some coun-
tries tax profits as received on a cash basis, whereas others tax profits earned on
an accrual basis. Differences can also exist in treatments of noncash charges, such
as depreciation, amortization, and depletion. Finally, the existence of tax agree-
ments between the United States and other governments can influence not only
762

the total tax bill of the parent MNC but also its international operations and
financial activities.
Tax Rules
Different home countries apply varying tax rates and rules to the global earnings of
their own multinationals. Moreover, tax rules are subject to frequent modifica-
tions. In the United States, for instance, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 resulted in cer-
tain changes affecting the taxation of U.S.-based MNCs. Special provisions apply
to tax deferrals by MNCs on foreign income; operations set up in U.S. possessions,
such as the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa; capital gains from the
sale of stock in a foreign corporation; and withholding taxes. Furthermore, MNCs
(both U.S. and foreign) can be subject to national as well as local taxes. Obviously,
these laws can make a big difference in a multinational’s tax bill.
As a general practice, the U.S. government claims jurisdiction over all the
income of an MNC, wherever earned. (Special rules apply to foreign corpora-
tions conducting business in the United States.) However, it may be possible for a
multinational company to take foreign income taxes as a direct credit against its
U.S. tax liabilities. The following example illustrates one way of accomplishing
this objective.
American Enterprises, a U.S.-based MNC that manufactures heavy machinery, has
a foreign subsidiary that earns $100,000 before local taxes. All of the after-tax
funds are available to the parent in the form of dividends. The applicable taxes
consist of a 35% foreign income tax rate, a foreign dividend withholding tax rate
of 10%, and a U.S. tax rate of 34%.
Subsidiary income before local taxes
$100,000
Foreign income tax at 35%
Dividend available to be declared
$  65,000
Foreign dividend withholding tax at 10%
MNC’s receipt of dividends
Using the so-called grossing up procedure, the MNC will add the full before-tax
subsidiary income to its total taxable income. Next, the company calculates the
U.S. tax liability on the grossed-up income. Finally, the related taxes paid in the
foreign country are applied as a credit against the additional U.S. tax liability:

$ 34,000
Total foreign taxes paid, 
to be used as a credit 
($35,000
$6,500)
U.S. taxes due
Net funds available to the parent MNC
Because the U.S. tax liability is less than the total taxes paid to the foreign gov-
ernment, no additional U.S. taxes are due on the income from the foreign sub-
sidiary. In our example, if tax credits had not been allowed, then “double taxation”

by the two authorities, as shown in what follows, would have resulted in a sub-
stantial drop in the overall net funds available to the parent MNC:
Subsidiary income before local taxes
$100,000
Foreign income tax at 35%
Dividend available to be declared
$  65,000
Foreign dividend withholding tax at 10%
MNC’s receipt of dividends
$  58,500
U.S. tax liability at 34%
Net funds available to the parent MNC
The preceding example clearly demonstrates that the existence of bilateral
tax treaties and the subsequent application of tax credits can significantly
enhance the overall net funds available to MNCs from their worldwide earnings.
Consequently, in an increasingly complex and competitive international financial
environment, international taxation is one of the variables that multinational cor-
porations should fully utilize to their advantage.
FINANCIAL MARKETS
During the last two decades the Euromarket—which provides for borrowing and
lending currencies outside their country of origin—has grown rapidly. The
Euromarket provides multinational companies with an “external” opportunity to
borrow or lend funds and to do so with less government regulation.
Growth of the Euromarket
The Euromarket has grown large for several reasons. First, beginning in the early
1960s, the Russians wanted to maintain their dollar earnings outside the legal
jurisdiction of the United States, mainly because of the Cold War. Second, the
consistently large U.S. balance-of-payments deficits helped to “scatter” dollars
around the world. Third, the existence of specific regulations and controls on
dollar deposits in the United States, including interest rate ceilings imposed by the
government, helped to send such deposits to places outside the United States.
These and other factors have combined and contributed to the creation of an
“external” capital market. Its size cannot be accurately determined, mainly
because of its lack of regulation and control. Several sources that periodically
estimate its size are the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), Morgan Guaranty
Trust, the World Bank, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD). By 2007, the overall size of the Euromarket was well above
$4.0 trillion net international lending.
One aspect of the Euromarket is the so-called offshore centers. Certain cities
or states around the world—including London, Singapore, Bahrain, Nassau,
Hong Kong, and Luxembourg—are considered major offshore centers for
Euromarket business. The availability of communication and transportation
facilities, along with language, costs, time zones, taxes, and local banking regula-
tions, are among the main reasons for the prominence of these centers.
In recent decades, various new financial instruments have appeared in the
international financial markets. One is interest rate and currency swaps. Another
is various combinations of forward and options contracts on different currencies.

A third is new types of bonds and notes—along with an international version of

rity, and interest rate. More details will be provided in subsequent discussions.
Major Participants
The U.S. dollar continues to dominate various segments of the global financial
markets. For example, central banks worldwide maintain the major portion of
their reserves in the dollar. Yet, in other activities—including currency in circula-
tion and the international bond market—the euro has surpassed the dollar, with
more challenges coming from other, potential contenders such as the Chinese
yuan. Similarly, although U.S. banks and other financial institutions continue to
play a significant role in the global markets, financial giants from Japan and
Europe have become major participants in the Euromarket.
In the three decades leading up to the new millennium, many countries in
Latin America, Asia, and Africa borrowed in the global financial markets. They
accumulated huge international debts, resulting in many financial and currency
crises. Clearly, as the 1997 financial/currency crises of Asia, the 1998 currency
collapse of Russia, and the 2001–2002 default of Argentina showed, too much
international debt, along with unstable economies and currencies, can cause mas-
sive financial losses and problems for the world’s MNCs. The latest IMF data,
however, confirm that, beginning in 2000, nonindustrialized countries’ external
debt (as a percentage of exports of goods and services) has been declining and is
expected to continue to do so. Many of these nations have replaced their foreign-
currency debts with local-currency instruments. Also, they have further liberal-
ized their respective economies by allowing long-term capital inflows of foreign
direct investments, thus reducing their exposure to foreign exchange risk.
Although nation-states may have slowed down their official borrowings in
this decade, private enterprises, including multinational companies, continue to
obtain funds (and invest) in international markets. Both Eurocurrency and
Eurobond markets are extensively used by MNCs.

19.2 Financial Statements
Several features differentiate internationally based reports from domestically ori-
ented financial statements. Among these are the issues of foreign subsidiary char-
acterization, the functional currency approach of U.S. MNCs, and the translation
of individual accounts.
LG 2

SUBSIDIARY CHARACTERIZATION 
AND FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY
For a multinational company based outside the United States, its foreign sub-
sidiaries’ type of operations will determine the translation method the firm will
use. For U.S.-based MNCs, the determining factor is the functional currency of
each subsidiary. Table 19.2 provides further details on these points.
TRANSLATION OF INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS
Unlike domestic items in financial statements, international items require transla-
tion back into U.S. dollars. Since December 1982, all financial statements of U.S.
multinationals (with the exceptions noted below) have had to conform to
Statement No. 52 issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).
The basic rules of FASB No. 52 are given in Figure 19.1.
FASB No. 52
Under FASB No. 52, the current-rate method is implemented in a two-step
process. First, each subsidiary’s balance sheet and income statement are measured
in terms of the functional currency by using generally accepted accounting princi-
ples (GAAP). That is, each subsidiary translates foreign-currency elements into
the functional currency—the currency in which a subsidiary primarily generates
and expends cash and in which its accounts are maintained before financial state-
ments are submitted to the parent for consolidation.
In the second step, the functional-currency-denominated financial statements
of the foreign subsidiary are translated into the parent’s currency. This is done
using the all-current-rate method, which requires the translation of all balance
sheet items at the closing rate and all income statement items at average rates.
Each of these steps can result in certain gains or losses. The first step can lead
to transaction (cash) gains or losses. Whether realized or not, these gains or losses
are charged directly to current income. The completion of the second step can
result in translation (accounting) adjustments, which are excluded from current
income. Instead, the MNC discloses and charges these amounts to a separate
component of stockholders’ equity.

all-current-rate method
The method by which the
functional-currency-
denominated financial
statements of an MNC’s

Temporal Method
The temporal method, along with a variation called monetary/non-monetary
method, is an alternative translation approach used throughout the world. For U.S.-
based multinationals, as highlighted in both Table 19.2 and Figure 19.1, when the
functional currency is the U.S. dollar or a third currency, the temporal method is
used. This method requires that specific assets and liabilities be translated at so-
called historical exchange rates and that foreign-exchange translation gains or losses
be reflected in current year’s income. Also, if a U.S. MNC has a subsidiary in a
hyperinflation country—defined as a host nation experiencing a cumulative inflation
of more than 100 percent over a 3-year period—then the temporal method is used.
(In some countries, the inflation rates can be significantly higher. In Zimbabwe, for
example, in early 2007 the monthly inflation rate exceeded 1,500 percent.)

examine the relationships that exist among various currencies, the causes of
exchange rate changes, and the impact of currency fluctuations.
Relationships among Currencies
Since the mid-1970s, the major currencies of the world have had a floating—as
opposed to a fixed—relationship with respect to the U.S. dollar and to one
another. Among the currencies regarded as being major (or “hard”) currencies
are the British pound sterling (£), the European Union euro (;), the Japanese yen
(¥), the Canadian dollar (C$), and, of course, the U.S. dollar (US$). As previously
pointed out, by 2007, 13 members of the EU had adopted the euro, in circulation
since 2002. It has gained wide acceptance and usage in international transac-
tions—particularly debt securities issues.
The value of two currencies with respect to each other, or their foreign
exchange rate, is expressed as follows:
Because the U.S. dollar has served as the principal currency of international
finance for more than 60 years, the usual exchange rate quotation in interna-
tional markets is given as ¥119.77/US$, where the unit of account is the Japanese
yen and the unit of currency being priced is one U.S. dollar. In this case, the dollar
is the currency that is actually being priced. Expressing the exchange rate as
US$0.008349/¥ would indicate a dollar price for the Japanese yen.
For the major currencies, the existence of a floating relationship means that
the value of any two currencies with respect to each other is allowed to fluctuate
on a daily basis. Conversely, some of the nonmajor currencies of the world try to
maintain a fixed (or semifixed) relationship with respect to one of the major cur-
rencies, a combination (basket) of major currencies, or some type of international
foreign exchange standard.
Every day, foreign exchange markets establish two key prices that govern
trade in the world’s major currencies. One price is the spot exchange rate—the rate
on that day. The other price is the forward exchange rate—the rate at some speci-
fied future date. The foreign exchange rates given in Figure 19.2 illustrate these
concepts. For instance, the figure shows that at the close on Friday, July 30, 2010,
the spot rate for the Japanese yen was US$0.011574 (or ¥86.40/US$, as usually
stated), and the forward (future) rate was US$0.011577/¥ (or ¥86.38/US$) for 
1-month delivery. In other words, on July 30, 2010, one could execute a contract
to take delivery of Japanese yen in 1 month at a dollar price of US$0.011577/¥.
Forward rates are also quoted for 3-month and 6-month contracts (with other,
tailor-made contracts of desired maturities available to clients through the inter-
bank market). For all such contracts, the agreements and signatures are completed
on, say, July 30, 2010, but the actual exchange of dollars and Japanese yen
between buyers and sellers will take place on the future date (say, 1 month later).
Figure 19.2 also illustrates the differences between floating currencies and
those that are either fixed or exhibit less movement over time. The middle data
columns in Figure 19.2 show the 1-day and year-to-date (YTD) percentage change
in each currency’s movement vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. All the major currencies pre-
viously mentioned, along with minor (or “soft”) currencies such as the Indian
rupee and the Thai baht, have experienced some changes since the beginning of

the year. On the other hand, the Kuwaiti dinar and the Saudi Arabian riyal have
undergone no change over this period.
For the floating currencies, changes in the value of foreign exchange rates are
called appreciation or depreciation. For any currency that is fixed in value (with
respect to the U.S. dollar or another major currency), changes in values are called
official revaluation or devaluation, but these terms have the same meanings as
appreciation and depreciation, respectively.
Floyd Armstrong, an avid cyclist, is considering a bicycling tour
that for 1 week during the Tour de France will ride ahead of the
actual race. The cost of the tour, which includes ground transportation, hotels, and
route support in France, is 3,675 euros (;). He estimates that his round-trip airfare
(including shipment of his bike) from his home in Iowa will be $1,100; in addition
he will incur another $100 in incidental U.S. travel expenses. Floyd estimates the
cost of meals in France to be about ;400, and he plans to take an additional $1,000
to buy gifts and other merchandise while in France. From Figure 19.2, the current
exchange rate is US$1.3033/;1.00 (or ;0.7673/US$1.00). Given this information,
Floyd wishes to determine (1) the total dollar cost of the trip and (2) the amount
in euros he will need to cover the cost of meals, gifts, and other merchandise
while in France.

What Causes Exchange Rates to Change?
Although several economic and political factors influence foreign exchange rate
movements, by far the most important explanation for long-term changes in
exchange rates is a differing inflation rate between two countries. Countries that
experience high inflation rates will see their currencies decline in value (depre-
ciate) relative to the currencies of countries with lower inflation rates.
Assume that the current exchange rate between the United States and the new
nation of Farland is 2 Farland guineas (FG) per U.S. dollar, FG 2.00/US$, which
Example 19.3 3

*
*
Personal Finance Example 19.2 3
770
PART 8

is also equal to $0.50/FG. This exchange rate means that a basket of goods worth
$100 in the United States sells for $100
FG 2/US$
FG 200 in Farland, and
vice versa (goods worth FG 200 in Farland sell for $100 in the United States).
Now assume that inflation is running at a 25% annual rate in Farland but at
only a 2% annual rate in the United States. In one year, the same basket of goods
will sell for 1.25
FG 200
FG 250 in Farland, and for 1.02
$100
$102 in
the United States. These relative prices imply that in 1 year, FG 250 will be worth
$102, so the exchange rate in 1 year should change to FG 250/$102
FG 2.45/US$,
or $0.41/FG. In other words, the Farland guinea will depreciate from FG 2/US$ to
FG 2.45/US$, while the dollar will appreciate from $0.50/FG to $0.41/FG.
This simple example can also predict the level of interest rates in the two
countries. To be enticed to save money, an investor must be offered a return that
exceeds the country’s inflation rate—otherwise, there would be no reason to
forgo the pleasure of spending money (consuming) today because inflation would
make that money less valuable 1 year from now. Let’s assume that this real rate of
interest is 3 percent per year in both Farland and the United States. Using
Equation 6.1 (page 224), we can now reason that the nominal rate of interest—
the quoted market rate, not adjusted for risk—will be approximately equal to the
real rate plus the inflation rate in each country, or 
percent in
Farland and 
percent in the United States.1
Impact of Currency Fluctuations
Multinational companies face exchange rate risks under both floating and fixed
arrangements. Floating currencies can be used to illustrate these risks. Consider
the U.S. dollar–U.K. British pound relationship; note that the forces of interna-
tional supply and demand, as well as economic and political elements, help to
shape both the spot and the forward rates between these two currencies. Because
the MNC cannot control much (or most) of these “outside” elements, the com-
pany faces potential changes in exchange rates. These changes can, in turn, affect
the MNC’s revenues, costs, and profits as measured in U.S. dollars. For fixed-rate
currencies, official revaluation or devaluation, like the changes brought about by
the market in the case of floating currencies, can affect the MNC’s operations and
its dollar-based financial position.
MNC, Inc., a multinational manufacturer of dental drills, has a subsidiary in Great
Britain that at the end of 2012 had the financial statements shown in Table 19.3 on
page 772. The figures for the balance sheet and income statement are given in the
local currency, British pounds (£). Using an assumed foreign exchange rate of
£0.70/US$ for December 31, 2012, MNC has translated the statements into U.S.
dollars. For simplicity, it is assumed that all the local figures are expected to
remain the same during 2113. As a result, as of January 1, 2013, the subsidiary
expects to show the same British pound figures on 12/31/13 as on 12/31/12.
However, because of the appreciation in the assumed value of the British pound

1. This is an approximation of the true relationship, which is actually multiplicative. The correct formula says that
1 plus the nominal rate of interest, r, is equal to the product of 1 plus the real rate of interest, r*, and 1 plus the infla-
tion rate, IP; that is, 
. This means that the nominal interest rates for Farland and the
United States should be 28.75 percent and 5.06 percent, respectively.
(1 + r) = (1 + r*) * (1 + IP)

relative to the dollar, from £0.70/US$ to £0.60/US$, the translated dollar values
of the items on the balance sheet, along with the dollar profit value on 12/31/13,
are higher than those of the previous year. The changes are due only to fluctua-
tions in the foreign exchange rate. In this case, the British pound appreciated rel-
ative to the U.S. dollar, which means that the U.S. dollar depreciated relative to
the British pound.
There are additional complexities attached to each individual account in the
financial statements. For instance, it matters whether a subsidiary’s debt is all in
the local currency, all in U.S. dollars, or in several currencies. Moreover, it is
important which currency (or currencies) the revenues and costs are denominated
in. The risks shown so far relate to what is called the accounting exposure. In
other words, foreign exchange rate fluctuations affect individual accounts in the
financial statements.
A different, and perhaps more important, risk element concerns economic
exposure, which is the potential impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on
the firm’s value. Given that all future revenues and thus net profits can be subject
to foreign exchange rate changes, it is obvious that the present value of the net
profits derived from foreign operations will have, as a part of its total diversifi-
able risk, an element reflecting appreciation (revaluation) or depreciation (deval-
uation) of various currencies with respect to the U.S. dollar.

What can the management of MNCs do about these risks? The actions will
depend on the attitude of the management toward risk. This attitude, in turn,
translates into how aggressively management wants to hedge (that is, protect
against) the company’s undesirable positions and exposures. The firm can use
the money markets, the forward (futures) markets, and the foreign-currency
options markets—either individually or in combination—to hedge foreign
exchange exposures. Further details on certain hedging strategies are described
later.
POLITICAL RISKS
Another important risk facing MNCs is political risk. Political risk refers to a
host government’s implementation of specific rules and regulations that can result
in the discontinuity or seizure of the operations of a foreign company. Political
risk is usually manifested in the form of nationalization, expropriation, or confis-
cation. In general, the host government takes over the assets and operations of a
foreign firm, usually without proper (or any) compensation.
Political risk has two basic paths, macro and micro. Macro political risk
refers to political change, revolution, or the adoption of new policies by a host
government, which subject all foreign firms in the country to political risk. In
other words, no individual country or firm is treated differently; all assets and
operations of foreign firms are taken over wholesale. An example of macro
political risk occurred after communist regimes came to power in China in 1949
and Cuba in 1959–1960. Micro political risk, on the other hand, refers to the
case in which an individual firm, a specific industry, or companies from a partic-
ular foreign country are subjected to takeover. In the first decade of the twenty-
first century—especially in the second half—Russia, Venezuela, and Bolivia were
among those countries that had either nationalized the operations or suspended
the long-term contractual agreements held by foreign multinationals in their
respective nations. Recent years have also seen the emergence of a third path to
political risk that encompasses “global” events such as terrorism, antiglobaliza-
tion movements and protests, Internet-based risks, and concerns over poverty,
AIDS, and the environment, all of which affect various MNCs’ operations
worldwide.
Although political risk can take place in any country—even in the United
States—the political instability of many developing nations generally makes the
positions of multinational companies most vulnerable there. At the same time, some
of these countries have the most promising markets for the goods and services
MNCs offer. The main question, therefore, is how to engage in operations and for-
eign investment in such countries and yet avoid or minimize the potential political
risk.
Table 19.4 shows some of the approaches that MNCs may be able to adopt
to cope with political risk. The negative approaches are generally used by firms in
extractive industries such as oil and gas and mining. The external approaches are
also of limited use. The best policies MNCs can follow are the positive approaches,
which have both economic and political aspects.
In recent years, MNCs have been relying on a variety of complex forecasting
techniques whereby international experts, using available historical data, predict
the chances for political instability in a host country and the potential effects on
MNC operations. Events in Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and Russia, among

others, however, point to the limited use of such techniques and tend to reinforce
the usefulness of the positive approaches.
A final point relates to the introduction by most host governments in the last
two decades of comprehensive sets of rules, regulations, and incentives. Known
as national entry control systems, they are aimed at regulating inflows of foreign
direct investments involving MNCs. They are designed to extract more benefits
from MNCs’ presence by regulating flows of a variety of factors—local owner-
ship, level of exportation, use of local inputs, number of local managers, internal
geographic location, level of local borrowing, and the percentages of profits to be
remitted and of capital to be repatriated to parent firms. Host countries expect
that as MNCs comply with these regulations, the potential for acts of political
risk will decline, thus benefiting the MNCs as well.

focus on ETHICS
Chiquita’s Slippery Situation
For many people, the
little blue “Chiquita”
sticker is as familiar as a banana’s yel-
low peel. One of the world’s two largest
banana companies (along with Dole
Food Co.), Cincinnati-based Chiquita is
a global business with operations on six
continents. Chiquita sources its bananas
from Latin America, operating banana
farms stretching from Mexico to Ecuador.
Chiquita is so heavily invested in the
region that, for a time, it was the largest
employer in Latin America.
Bananas are not the only item in
Chiquita’s product line, but they are by
far the most important, representing
over 50 percent of the company’s
sales. Because the banana industry is
highly competitive, Chiquita’s relation-
ships in Latin America are vital to its
success. This is reflected in the follow-
ing statement from the company’s
2009 Annual Report: “To compete suc-
cessfully, we must be able to source
bananas of uniformly high quality at a
competitive cost, maintain strong cus-
tomer relationships, and quickly and
reliably transport and distribute prod-
ucts to worldwide markets.”
Unfortunately, some of the countries
where Chiquita operates are unsafe
and unstable. A prime example is
Colombia, where militant organiza-
tions, such as the United Self-Defense
Forces of Colombia (AUC), wield a
considerable amount of power.
In 1997, Chiquita received threats
to its facilities and employees and,
through its Colombian subsidiary,
began making payments to the AUC in
exchange for protection. Although the
extortion payments were not technically
illegal when Chiquita first started mak-
ing them, they posed an ethical chal-
lenge. The legality of the payments
changed in 2001 when the U.S. State
Department identified the AUC as a
specially designated foreign terrorist
organization, making it illegal for
Chiquita to do business with them.
In 2003, Chiquita sought guidance
from the U.S. Justice Department and
admitted to paying millions of dollars to
the AUC. The payments finally stopped
in 2004 when Chiquita sold its
Colombian banana operations to a
local company. Chiquita settled its case
with the U.S. Justice Department in
2007 by pleading guilty to a single
felony count and agreeing to pay a
$25 million fine. This gave Chiquita
the dubious distinction of becoming the
first U.S. corporation ever convicted of
financial dealings with terrorists.
3 Chiquita saw their options in
Colombia as (a) pay extortion to a
terrorist organization or (b) put their
employees’ safety at risk. Is it ethi-
cal to break the law in an effort to
save lives?

19.4 Long-Term Investment and 
Financing Decisions
Important long-term aspects of international managerial finance include foreign
direct investment, investment cash flows and decisions, capital structure, long-
term debt, and equity capital. Here we consider the international dimensions of
these topics.
FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT
Foreign direct investment (FDI) is the transfer of capital, managerial, and technical
assets to a foreign country, by a multinational firm. FDI can be explained on the
basis of two main approaches, the OLI paradigm and strategic motives by MNCs.
The first encompasses “O” (owner-specific) advantages in an MNC’s home

market, “L” (location-specific) characteristics abroad, and “I” (internalization)
through which the multinational controls the value chain in its industry. The
second refers to companies that invest abroad as they seek markets, raw materials,
production efficiency, knowledge, and/or political safety.
The equity participation on the part of an MNC can be 100 percent (resulting in
a wholly owned foreign subsidiary) or less (leading to a joint-venture project with
foreign participants). In contrast to short-term foreign portfolio investments under-
taken by individuals and companies (such as internationally diversified mutual
funds), FDI involves equity participation, managerial control, and day-to-day oper-
ational activities on the part of MNCs. Therefore, FDI projects will be subjected not
only to business, financial, inflation, and exchange rate risks (as would foreign port-
folio investments) but also to the additional element of political risk.
For several decades, U.S.-based MNCs dominated the international scene in
terms of both the flow and the stock of FDI. The total FDI stock of U.S.-based
MNCs, for instance, increased from $7.7 billion in 1929 to more than $2,050 billion
at the end of 2005. Since the 1970s, though, their global presence is being chal-
lenged by MNCs based in Western Europe, Japan, and other developed and devel-
oping nations. In fact, even the “home” market of U.S. multinationals is being
challenged by foreign firms. For instance, in 1960, FDI into the United States
amounted to only 11.5 percent of U.S. investment overseas. According to figures
released by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis, at
the end of 2005, the U.S. direct investment position abroad on a historical-cost
basis was about $2,070 billion, while the foreign direct investment position in the
United States on a historical-cost basis stood at about $1,635 billion. The latter
figure is close to 80 percent of the former.
INVESTMENT CASH FLOWS AND DECISIONS
Measuring the amount invested in a foreign project, its resulting cash flows, and
the associated risk is difficult. The returns and NPVs of such investments can sig-
nificantly vary from the subsidiary’s and parent’s points of view. Therefore, sev-
eral factors that are unique to the international setting need to be examined when
one is making long-term investment decisions.
First, firms need to consider elements related to a parent company’s investment
in a subsidiary and the concept of taxes. For example, in the case of manufac-
turing investments, questions may arise as to the value of the equipment a parent
may contribute to the subsidiary. Is the value based on market conditions in the
parent country or in the local host economy? In general, the market value in the
host country is the relevant “price.”
The existence of different taxes—as pointed out earlier—can complicate meas-
urement of the cash flows to be received by the parent because different definitions
of taxable income can arise. There are still other complications when it comes to
measuring the actual cash flows. From a parent firm’s viewpoint, the cash flows are
those that are repatriated from the subsidiary. In some countries, however, such
cash flows may be totally or partially blocked. Obviously, depending on the life of
the project in the host country, the returns and NPVs associated with such projects
can vary significantly from the subsidiary’s and the parent’s points of view. For
instance, for a project of only 5 years’ duration, if all yearly cash flows are blocked
by the host government, the subsidiary may show a “normal” or even superior
return and NPV, although the parent may show no return at all. For a project of

country.

longer life, even if cash flows are blocked for the first few years, the remaining
years’ cash flows can contribute to the parent’s returns and NPV.
Finally, there is the issue of risk attached to international cash flows. The
three basic types of risks are (1) business and financial risks, (2) inflation and
exchange rate risks, and (3) political risks. The first category reflects the type of
industry the subsidiary is in as well as its financial structure. We will present more
details on financial risks later. As for the other two categories, we have already
discussed the risks of having investments, profits, and assets/liabilities in different
currencies and the potential impacts of political risks.
The presence of the three types of risks will influence the discount rate to be
used when evaluating international cash flows. The basic rule is this: The local
cost of equity capital (applicable to the local business and financial environments
within which a subsidiary operates) is the starting discount rate. To this rate, the
MNC would add the risks stemming from exchange rate and political factors,
and from it, would subtract the benefits reflecting the parent’s lower capital costs.
CAPITAL STRUCTURE
Both theory and empirical evidence indicate that the capital structures of multi-
national companies differ from those of purely domestic firms. Furthermore, dif-
ferences are observed among the capital structures of MNCs domiciled in various
countries. Several factors tend to influence the capital structures of MNCs.
International Capital Markets
MNCs, unlike smaller, domestic firms, have access to the Euromarket (discussed
earlier) and the variety of financial instruments available there. Because of their
access to the international bond and equity markets, MNCs may have lower
long-term financing costs, which result in differences between the capital struc-
tures of MNCs and those of purely domestic companies. Similarly, MNCs based
in different countries and regions may have access to different currencies and
markets, resulting in variances in capital structures for these multinationals.
International Diversification
It is well established that MNCs, in contrast to domestic firms, can achieve further
risk reduction in their cash flows by diversifying internationally. International
diversification may lead to varying degrees of debt versus equity. Empirically, the
evidence on debt ratios is mixed. Some studies have found MNCs’ debt propor-
tions to be higher than those of domestic firms. Other studies have concluded the
opposite, citing imperfections in certain foreign markets, political risk factors,
and complexities in the international financial environment that cause higher
agency costs of debt for MNCs.
An important aspect of personal financial planning involves
channeling savings into investments that can grow and fund
long-term financial goals. Investors can invest in both domestic and foreign-based
companies. Investing internationally offers greater diversification than investing
only domestically. A number of academic studies overwhelmingly support the
argument that well-structured international diversification does indeed reduce

CHAPTER 19

the risk of a portfolio and increase the return of portfolios of comparable risk.
One study found that over the 10 years ended in 1994, a diversified portfolio
consisting of 70% domestic and 30% foreign stocks reduced risk by about 5%
and increased return by about 7%.
To capture these higher returns and lower risks, most individual investors
buy international mutual funds. These funds take advantage of international eco-
nomic developments by (1) capitalizing on changing foreign market conditions
and (2) positioning their investments to benefit from devaluation of the dollar.
Clearly, individuals should consider including some international investments—
probably international mutual funds—in their investment portfolios.
Country Factors
A number of studies conclude that certain factors unique to each host country can
cause differences in capital structures. These factors include legal, tax, political,
social, and financial aspects, as well as the overall relationship between the public
and private sectors. Owing to these factors, differences have been found not only
among MNCs based in various countries but also among the foreign subsidiaries
of an MNC. However, because no one capital structure is ideal for all MNCs, each
multinational has to consider a set of global and domestic factors when deciding

Take an Overseas Assignment to Take a Step 
Up the Corporate Ladder
There is nothing like
an extended stay in a
foreign country to get a different per-
spective on world events, and there are
sound career-enhancing reasons to
work abroad. International experience
can give you a competitive edge and
may be vital to career advancement.
Such experience goes far beyond mas-
tering country-specific tax and account-
ing codes.
The demand for employees inter-
ested in an overseas assignment was
on an upward trend from 2005 to
2008. Driven by a booming global
economy, more than two-thirds of multi-
national corporations reported an
increase in the number of international
assignments in 2006, according to the
Global Relocation Trends Survey, pub-
lished annually by GMAC Global
Relocation Services. A similar percent-
age of employers sent even more
employees on overseas assignments in
2007 as compared to 2006.
As a result of the global recession,
a record number of companies cut
overseas assignments of employees in
2009. Forty-six percent of multinational
companies reported a decrease in the
number of international assignments,
but with the economy stabilizing 44
percent of multinational firms expected
the number of international assignments
to increase in 2010.
On arrival in a foreign city, the ten-
dency for expatriates is to live in a sec-
tion of the city favored by other visitors
from home. For security reasons, some
executives also travel everywhere by
chauffeured limo with an English-
speaking driver. It is possible for U.S.
executives to live abroad for an extended
period of time without soaking up much
of the local culture. Doing so may
increase one’s comfort level but at the
loss of some of the valuable lessons to
be learned from living abroad.
Oversees assignments do not come
without some sacrifices. Long overseas
postings can put stress on a family. The
most common reason for turning down
an international assignment involved
family concerns such as children’s edu-

on the appropriate capital structure for both the overall corporation and its 
subsidiaries. Understanding country factors can help financial managers make
better-informed decisions. As the Global Focus box discusses, one way to improve
one’s ability to understand how business is conducted in other countries is to take an
overseas assignment.
LONG-TERM DEBT
As noted earlier, multinational companies have access to a variety of interna-
tional financial instruments. Here we will discuss international bonds, the role of
international financial institutions in underwriting such instruments, and the use
of various techniques by MNCs to change the structure of their long-term debt.
International Bonds
In general, an international bond is one that is initially sold outside the country of
the borrower and is often distributed in several countries. When a bond is issued
by a foreign corporation or government and is denominated in the investor’s
home currency and sold in the investor’s home market, it is called a foreign bond.
For example, an MNC based in Germany might float a foreign bond issue in the
British capital market underwritten by a British syndicate and denominated in
British pounds. When an international bond is sold to investors in countries with
currencies other than the currency in which the bond is denominated, it is called
a Eurobond. Thus, an MNC based in the United States might float a Eurobond in
several European capital markets, underwritten by an international syndicate and
denominated in U.S. dollars.
The U.S. dollar and the euro are the most frequently used currencies for
Eurobond issues, with the euro rapidly increasing in popularity relative to the
U.S. dollar. In the foreign bond category, the U.S. dollar and the euro are major
choices. Low interest rates, the general stability of the currency, and the overall
efficiency of the European Union’s capital markets are among the primary rea-
sons for the growing popularity of the euro.
Eurobonds are much more popular than foreign bonds. These instruments
are heavily used, especially in relation to Eurocurrency loans in recent years, by
major market participants, including U.S. corporations. The so-called equity-
linked Eurobonds (that is, Eurobonds convertible to equity), especially those
offered by a number of U.S. firms, have found strong demand among Euromarket
participants. It is expected that more of these innovative types of instruments will
emerge on the international scene in the coming years.
A final point concerns the levels of interest rates in international markets. In
the case of foreign bonds, interest rates are usually directly correlated with the
domestic rates prevailing in the respective countries. For Eurobonds, several
interest rates may be influential. For instance, for a Eurodollar bond, the interest
rate will reflect several different rates, most notably the U.S. long-term rate, the
Eurodollar rate, and long-term rates in other countries.
The Role of International Financial Institutions
For foreign bonds, the underwriting institutions are those that handle bond issues
in the respective countries in which such bonds are issued. For Eurobonds, a
number of financial institutions in the United States, Western Europe, and Japan
form international underwriting syndicates. The underwriting costs for Eurobonds
are comparable to those for bond flotation in the U.S. domestic market. Although

U.S. institutions once dominated the Eurobond scene, economic and financial
strengths exhibited by some Western European (especially German) financial
firms have led to an erosion in that dominance. Since 1986, a number of
European firms have shared with U.S. firms the top positions in terms of acting as
lead underwriters of Eurobond issues. However, U.S. investment banks continue
to dominate most other international security issuance markets—such as interna-
tional equity, medium-term note, syndicated loan, and commercial paper mar-
kets. U.S. corporations account for well over half of the worldwide securities
issues made each year.
To raise funds through international bond issues, many MNCs establish their
own financial subsidiaries. Many U.S.-based MNCs, for example, have created
subsidiaries in the United States and Western Europe, especially in Luxembourg.
Such subsidiaries can be used to raise large amounts of funds in “one move,” the
funds being redistributed wherever MNCs need them. (Special tax rules appli-
cable to such subsidiaries also make them desirable to MNCs.)
Changing the Structure of Debt
As will be more fully explained later, MNCs can use hedging strategies to change the
structure/characteristics of their long-term assets and liabilities. For instance, multi-
nationals can use interest rate swaps to obtain a desired stream of interest payments
(for example, fixed rate) in exchange for another (for example, floating rate). With
currency swaps, they can exchange an asset/liability denominated in one currency
(for example, the U.S. dollar) for another (for example, the British pound). The use
of these tools allows MNCs to gain access to a broader set of markets, currencies,
and maturities, thus leading to both cost savings and a means of restructuring the
existing assets/liabilities. There has been significant growth in such use during the
last few years, and this trend is expected to continue.
EQUITY CAPITAL
Here we look at how multinational companies can raise equity capital abroad.
They can sell their shares in international capital markets, or they can use joint
ventures, which the host country sometimes requires.
Equity Issues and Markets
One means of raising equity funds for MNCs is to have the parent’s stock distrib-
uted internationally and owned by stockholders of different nationalities. Despite
some advancements made in recent years that have allowed numerous MNCs to
simultaneously list their respective stocks on a number of exchanges, the world’s
equity markets continue to be dominated by distinct national stock exchanges
(such as the New York, London, and Tokyo exchanges). At the end of 2006, for
example, a rather small portion of each of the world’s major stock exchanges con-
sisted of “foreign company” listings. Many commentators agree that most MNCs
would benefit enormously from an international stock market that had uniform
rules and regulations governing the major stock exchanges. Unfortunately, it will
likely be many years before such a market becomes a reality.
Even with the full financial integration of the European Union, some European
stock exchanges continue to compete with each other. Others have called for
more cooperation in forming a single market capable of competing with the New

York and Tokyo exchanges. As noted above, from the multinationals’ perspec-
tive, the most desirable outcome would be to have uniform international rules
and regulations with respect to all the major national stock exchanges. Such uni-
formity would allow MNCs unrestricted access to an international equity market
paralleling the international currency and bond markets.
Joint Ventures
Earlier, we discussed the basic aspects of foreign ownership of international oper-
ations. Worth emphasizing here is that certain laws and regulations enacted by a
number of host countries require MNCs to maintain less than 50 percent owner-
ship in their subsidiaries in those countries. For a U.S.-based MNC, for example,
establishing foreign subsidiaries in the form of joint ventures means that a certain
portion of the firm’s total international equity stock is (indirectly) held by foreign
owners.
In establishing a foreign subsidiary, an MNC may wish to use as little equity
and as much debt as possible, with the debt coming from local sources in the host
country or the MNC itself. Each of these actions can be supported: The use of
local debt can be a good protective measure to lessen the potential impacts of
political risk. Because local sources are involved in the capital structure of a sub-
sidiary, there may be fewer threats from local authorities in the event of changes
in government or the imposing of new regulations on foreign business.
In support of the other action—having more MNC-based debt in a sub-
sidiary’s capital structure—many host governments are less restrictive toward
intra-MNC interest payments than toward intra-MNC dividend remittances. The
parent firm, therefore, may be in a better position if it has more MNC-based debt
than equity in the capital structure of its subsidiaries.

19.5 Short-Term Financial Decisions
In international operations, the usual domestic sources of short-term financing,
along with other sources, are available to MNCs. Included are accounts payable,
accruals, bank and nonbank sources in each subsidiary’s local environment, and
the Euromarket. Our emphasis here is on the “foreign” sources.
The local economic market is a basic source of both short- and long-term
financing for a subsidiary of a multinational company. Moreover, the subsidiary’s
borrowing and lending status, relative to a local firm in the same economy, can be
LG 5

superior because the subsidiary can rely on the potential backing and guarantee
of its parent MNC. One drawback, however, is that most local markets and local
currencies are regulated by local authorities. A subsidiary may ultimately choose
to turn to the Euromarket and take advantage of borrowing and investing in an
unregulated financial forum.
The Euromarket offers nondomestic long-term financing opportunities through
Eurobonds, which were discussed in Chapter 6. Short-term financing opportuni-
ties are available in Eurocurrency markets. The forces of supply and demand are
among the main factors determining exchange rates in Eurocurrency markets.
Each currency’s normal interest rate is influenced by economic policies pursued
by the respective “home” government. For example, the interest rates offered in
the Euromarket on the U.S. dollar are greatly affected by the prime rate inside the
United States, and the dollar’s exchange rates with other major currencies are
influenced by the supply and demand forces in such markets (and in response to
interest rates).
Unlike borrowing in the domestic markets, where only one currency and a
nominal interest rate are involved, financing activities in the Euromarket can
involve several currencies and both nominal and effective interest rates. Effective
interest rates are equal to nominal rates plus (or minus) any forecast appreciation
(or depreciation) of a foreign currency relative to the currency of the MNC
parent. Stated differently, the figures for effective rates are derived by adjusting
the nominal interest rates for the impact of foreign-currency movements on both
the principal and interest amounts. Equation 19.1 can be used to calculate the
effective interest rate for a specific currency (E), given the nominal interest rate
for the currency (N) and its forecast percentage change (F):
(19.1)
An example will illustrate the application and interpretation of this relationship.
A multinational plastics company, International Molding, has subsidiaries in
Switzerland (local currency, Swiss franc, Sf) and Japan (local currency, Japanese
yen, ¥). On the basis of each subsidiary’s forecast operations, the short-term
financial needs (in equivalent U.S. dollars) are as follows:
Switzerland: $80 million excess cash to be invested (lent)
Japan: $60 million funds to be raised (borrowed)
On the basis of all the available information, the parent firm has provided each
subsidiary with the figures given in the table on page 783 for exchange rates and
interest rates. (The figures for the effective rates shown are derived using
Equation 19.1.)
From the MNC’s point of view, the effective rates of interest, which take into
account each currency’s forecast percentage change (appreciation or deprecia-
tion) relative to the U.S. dollar, are the main considerations in investment and
borrowing decisions. (It is assumed here that because of local regulations, a sub-
sidiary is not permitted to use the domestic market of any other subsidiary.) The
relevant question is where funds should be invested and borrowed.
For investment purposes, the highest available effective rate of interest is
3.30% in the US$ Euromarket. Therefore, the Swiss subsidiary should invest the

$80 million in Swiss francs in U.S. dollars. To raise funds, the cheapest source
open to the Japanese subsidiary is the 2.01% effective rate for the Swiss franc in
the Euromarket. The subsidiary should therefore raise the $60 million in Swiss
francs in the Euromarket. These two transactions will result in the most revenues
and least costs, respectively.
Several points should be made with respect to the preceding example. First,
this is a simplified case of the actual workings of the Eurocurrency markets. The
example ignores taxes, intersubsidiary investing and borrowing, and periods
longer or shorter than a year. Nevertheless, it shows how the existence of many
currencies can provide both challenges and opportunities for MNCs. Next, the
focus has been solely on accounting values; of greater importance would be the
impact of these actions on market value. Finally, it is important to note the fol-
lowing details about the figures presented. The forecast percentage change data
are those normally supplied by the MNC’s international financial managers.
Management may instead want a range of forecasts, from the most likely to the
least likely. In addition, the company’s management is likely to take a specific
position in terms of its response to any remaining exchange rate exposures. If any
action is to be taken, certain amounts of one or more currencies will be borrowed
and then invested in other currencies in the hope of realizing potential gains to
offset potential losses associated with the exposures.
CASH MANAGEMENT
In its international cash management, a multinational firm can respond to exchange
rate risks by protecting (hedging) its undesirable cash and marketable securities
exposures or by making certain adjustments in its operations. The former approach
is more applicable in responding to accounting exposures, the latter to economic
exposures. Here, we examine each of these two approaches.
Hedging Strategies
Hedging strategies are techniques used to offset or protect against risk. In interna-
tional cash management, these strategies include actions such as borrowing or
lending in different currencies; undertaking contracts in the forward, futures, and/or
options markets; and swapping assets/liabilities with other parties. Table 19.5

briefly outlines some of the major hedging tools available to MNCs. By far, the
most commonly used technique is hedging with a forward contract.
To demonstrate how you can use a forward contract to hedge exchange rate
risk, assume you are a financial manager for Boeing Company, which has just
booked a sale of three airplanes worth $360 million to Japan’s All Nippon
Airways. The sale is denominated in Japanese yen, and the current spot exchange
rate is ¥108.37/US$. Therefore, you have priced this airplane sale at ¥39.0132
billion. If delivery were to occur today, there would be no foreign exchange risk.
However, delivery and payment will not occur for 90 days. If this transaction is
not hedged, Boeing will be exposed to a significant risk of loss if the Japanese yen
depreciates over the next 3 months.
Suppose that between now and the delivery date, the dollar appreciates
against the yen from ¥108.37/US$ to ¥110.25/US$. On delivery of the airplanes,
the agreed-upon ¥39.0132 billion will then be worth only US$353.861 million

originally planned for—a foreign exchange loss of more than US$6.1 million. If,
instead of remaining unhedged, you had sold the ¥39.0132 billion forward 
3 months earlier at the 90-day forward rate of ¥107.92/US$ offered by your
bank, you could have locked in a net dollar sale price of US$361.501 million
[(¥39.0132 billion/US$)
(¥107.92/US$)], realizing a foreign exchange gain of
more than $1.5 million. Clearly, this is a better alternative. Of course, if you had
remained unhedged, and the Japanese yen had appreciated beyond ¥107.92/US$,
your firm would have experienced an even larger foreign exchange profit—but
most MNCs prefer to make profits through sales of goods and services rather
than by speculating on the direction of exchange rates.
Adjustments in Operations
In responding to exchange rate fluctuations, MNCs can give their international
cash flows some protection through appropriate adjustments in assets and liabil-
ities. Two routes are available to a multinational company. The first centers on
the operating relationships that a subsidiary of an MNC maintains with other
firms—third parties. Depending on management’s expectation of a local cur-
rency’s position, adjustments in operations would involve the reduction of liabil-
ities if the currency is appreciating or the reduction of financial assets if it is
depreciating. For example, if a U.S.-based MNC with a subsidiary in Mexico
expects the peso to appreciate in value relative to the U.S. dollar, local customers’
accounts receivable would be increased and accounts payable would be reduced
if at all possible. Because the dollar is the currency in which the MNC parent will
have to prepare consolidated financial statements, the net result in this case
would be favorably to increase the Mexican subsidiary’s resources in local cur-
rency. If the peso were instead expected to depreciate, the local customers’
accounts receivable would be reduced and accounts payable would be increased,
thereby reducing the Mexican subsidiary’s resources in the local currency.
The second route focuses on the operating relationship a subsidiary has with
its parent or with other subsidiaries within the same MNC. In dealing with
exchange rate risks, a subsidiary can rely on intra-MNC accounts. Specifically,
undesirable exchange rate exposures can be corrected to the extent that the sub-
sidiary can take the following steps:
1. In appreciation-prone countries, collect intra-MNC accounts receivable as
soon as possible, and delay payment of intra-MNC accounts payable as long
as possible.
2. In depreciation-prone countries, collect intra-MNC accounts receivable as
late as possible, and pay intra-MNC accounts payable as soon as possible.
This technique is known as “leading and lagging” or simply as “leads and lags.”
Assume that a U.S.-based parent company, American Computer Corporation
(ACC), both buys parts from and sells parts to its wholly owned Mexican sub-
sidiary, Tijuana Computer Company (TCC). Assume further that ACC has
accounts payable of $10,000,000 that it is scheduled to pay TCC in 30 days and,
in turn, has accounts receivable of (Mexican peso) MP 115.00 million due from
TCC within 30 days. Because today’s exchange rate is MP 11.50/US$, the accounts
receivable are also worth $10,000,000. Therefore, parent and subsidiary owe
Example 19.7 3
,
,
CHAPTER 19
International Managerial Finance
785

each other equal amounts (though in different currencies), and both are payable
in 30 days, but because TCC is a wholly owned subsidiary of ACC the parent has
complete discretion over the timing of these payments.
If ACC believes that the Mexican peso will depreciate from MP 11.50/US$
to, say, MP 12.75/US$ during the next 30 days, the combined companies can
profit by collecting the weak currency (MP) debt immediately but delaying pay-
ment of the strong currency (US$) debt for the full 30 days allowed. If parent and
subsidiary do this, and the peso depreciates as predicted, the net result is that the
MP 115.00 million payment from TCC to ACC is made immediately and is safely
converted into $10,000,000 at today’s exchange rate. In comparison, the delayed
$10,000,000 payment from ACC to TCC will be worth MP 127.50 million [($10
million)
(MP 12.75/US$)]. Thus the Mexican subsidiary will experience a for-
eign exchange trading profit of MP 12.50 million (MP 127.50 million
MP
115.00 million), whereas the U.S. parent receives the full amount ($10 million)
due from TCC and therefore is unharmed.
As this example suggests, the manipulation of an MNC’s consolidated intra-
company accounts by one subsidiary generally benefits one subsidiary (or the
parent) while leaving the other subsidiary (or the parent) unharmed. The exact
degree and direction of the actual manipulations, however, may depend on the tax
status of each country. The MNC obviously would want to have the exchange rate
losses in the country with the higher tax rate. Finally, changes in intra-MNC
accounts can also be subject to restrictions and regulations put forward by the
respective host countries of various subsidiaries.
CREDIT AND INVENTORY MANAGEMENT
Multinational firms based in different countries compete for the same global
export markets. Therefore, it is essential that they offer attractive credit terms to
potential customers. Increasingly, however, the maturity of developed markets is
forcing MNCs to maintain and increase revenues by exporting and selling a
higher percentage of their output to developing countries. Given the risks associ-
ated with these buyers, as partly evidenced by their lack of a major (hard) cur-
rency, the MNC must use a variety of tools to protect such revenues. In addition
to the use of hedging and various asset and liability adjustments (described earlier),
MNCs should seek the backing of their respective governments in both identifying
target markets and extending credit. Multinationals based in a number of
Western European nations and those based in Japan benefit from extensive
involvement of government agencies that provide them with the needed service
and financial support. For U.S.-based MNCs, government agencies such as the
Export-Import Bank do not provide a comparable level of support.
In terms of inventory management, MNCs must consider a number of factors
related to both economics and politics. In addition to maintaining the appro-
priate level of inventory in various locations around the world, a multinational
firm must deal with exchange rate fluctuations, tariffs, nontariff barriers, integra-
tion schemes such as the EU, and other rules and regulations. Politically, invento-
ries could be subjected to wars, expropriations, blockages, and other forms of
government intervention.

19.6 Mergers and Joint Ventures
The motives for domestic mergers—growth or diversification, synergy, fund raising,
increased managerial skill or technology, tax considerations, increased ownership
liquidity, and defense against takeover—are all applicable to MNCs’ interna-
tional mergers and joint ventures. And we should consider several additional
points.
First, international mergers and joint ventures, especially those involving
European firms acquiring assets in the United States, increased significantly
beginning in the 1980s. MNCs based in Western Europe, Japan, and North
America are numerous. Moreover, a fast-growing group of MNCs has emerged in
the past two decades, some based in the so-called newly industrialized countries
(including Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and China’s Hong Kong), and others
operating from emerging nations (such as Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Israel,
China, Malaysia, Thailand, and India). Even though many of these companies
were hit hard by economic and currency crises (Asia in 1997, Russia in 1998, and
Latin America in 2001–2003), top firms from these and other countries have
been able to survive and even prosper. Additionally, many Western companies
have taken advantage of these economies’ weakness to buy into companies that
were previously off-limits to foreign investors. This has added further to the
number and value of international mergers.
The U.S. economy is among the largest recipients of FDI inflows. Most of the
foreign direct investors in the United States come from seven countries: the
United Kingdom, Canada, France, the Netherlands, Japan, Switzerland, and
Germany. The available data indicate that in terms of the method of entry—
namely mergers and acquisitions (M&A) versus “establishments”—an over-
whelming share of outlays committed by foreign multinationals in the United
States between 1980 and 2006 has consisted of M&A. These firms prefer M&A
through which they can target U.S. companies for their advanced technology (for
example, biotechnology firms), worldwide brands (restaurant chains and food
products), entertainment/media (theme parks), and financial institutions (invest-
ment banks). In contrast, in most emerging/developing nations (including China),
FDI inflows take place primarily via establishments.
Although the United States remains one of the most “open” countries to FDI
inflows, some of its actions in recent years have been viewed as less than wel-
coming. In 2005, for example, the U.S. governnment opposed a bid by a Chinese
state-owned oil company (CNOOC) to purchase an American one (UNOCAL),
which led to the ultimate withdrawal of the offer. Then, in 2005 and 2006,

similar opposition, along with an identical outcome, took place in relation to a
bid by a firm owned by the government of Dubai (in the United Arab Emirates)
to acquire port operations in the United States.
Another trend is the current increase in the number of joint ventures between
companies based in Japan and firms domiciled elsewhere in the industrialized
world, especially U.S.-based MNCs. In the eyes of some U.S. corporate execu-
tives, such business ventures are viewed as a “ticket into the Japanese market” as
well as a way to curb a potentially tough competitor.
Developing countries, too, have been attracting foreign direct investments in
many industries. Meanwhile, during the last two decades, a number of these
nations have adopted specific policies and regulations aimed at controlling the
inflows of foreign investments, a major provision being the 49 percent ownership
limitation applied to MNCs. Of course, international competition among MNCs
has benefited some developing countries in their attempts to extract concessions
from the multinationals. However, an increasing number of such nations have
shown greater flexibility in their recent dealings with MNCs, as MNCs have
become more reluctant to form joint ventures under the stated conditions.
Furthermore, it is likely that as more developing countries recognize the need for
foreign capital and technology, they will show even greater flexibility in their
agreements with MNCs.
A final point relates to the existence of international holding companies.
Places such as Liechtenstein and Panama have long been considered promising
spots for forming holding companies because of their favorable legal, corporate,
and tax environments. International holding companies control many business
entities in the form of subsidiaries, branches, joint ventures, and other agreements.
For international legal (especially tax-related) reasons, as well as anonymity, such
holding companies have become increasingly popular in recent years.

Summary
FOCUS ON VALUE
The growing interdependence of world markets has increased the importance of
international finance in managing the multinational company (MNC). As a
result, the financial manager must deal with international issues related to taxes,
financial markets, accounting and profit measurement and repatriation,
exchange rate risks caused by doing business in more than one currency, polit-
ical risks, financing (both debt and equity) and capital structure, short-term
financing, cash management issues related to hedging and adjustments in opera-
tions, and merger and joint-venture opportunities.
The complexity of each of these issues is significantly greater for the multi-
national firm than for a purely domestic firm. Consequently, the financial man-
ager must approach actions and decisions in the multinational firm using both
standard financial tools and techniques and additional procedures that recognize
the legal, institutional, and operating differences that exist in the multinational

environment. Just as in a purely domestic firm, action should be undertaken
only after the financial manager has determined that it will contribute to the
parent company’s overall goal of maximizing the owners’ wealth as reflected in
its share price.
REVIEW OF LEARNING GOALS
Understand the major factors that influence the financial operations of
multinational companies (MNCs). Important international trading blocs
emerged in the 1990s: one in the Americas as a result of NAFTA; the European
Union (EU); and Mercosur in South America. The EU is becoming even more
competitive as it achieves monetary union and many of its members use the euro
as a single currency. Free trade among the largest economic powers is governed
by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and is policed by the
World Trade Organization (WTO).
Setting up operations in foreign countries can entail special problems related
to the legal form of business organization chosen, the degree of ownership
allowed by the host country, and possible restrictions and regulations on the
return of capital and profits. Taxation of multinational companies is a complex
issue because of the existence of varying tax rates, differing definitions of 
taxable income, measurement differences, and tax treaties.
The existence and expansion of dollars held outside the United States have
contributed to the development of a major international financial market, the
Euromarket. The large international banks, developing and industrialized nations,
and multinational companies participate as borrowers and lenders in this market.
Describe the key differences between purely domestic and international
financial statements—consolidation, translation of individual accounts, and
international profits. Regulations that apply to international operations compli-
cate the preparation of foreign-based financial statements. Rulings in the United
States require the determination for translation purposes of the functional cur-
rency used in the operations of a foreign subsidiary. Individual accounts of sub-
sidiaries must be translated back into U.S. dollars using the procedures outlined
in FASB No. 52 and/or the temporal method. This standard also requires that
only certain transactional gains or losses from international operations be
included in the U.S. parent’s income statement.
Discuss exchange rate risk and political risk, and explain how MNCs
manage them. Economic exposure from exchange rate risk results from the exis-
tence of different currencies and their impact on the value of foreign operations.
Long-term changes in foreign exchange rates result primarily from differing
inflation rates in the two countries. The money markets, the forward (futures)
markets, and the foreign-currency options markets can be used to hedge foreign
exchange exposure. Political risks stem mainly from the implications of political
instability for the assets and operations of MNCs. MNCs can employ negative,
external, and positive approaches to cope with political risk.
Describe foreign direct investment, investment cash flows and decisions,
the MNCs’ capital structure, and the international debt and equity instruments
available to MNCs. Foreign direct investment (FDI) involves an MNC’s transfer
of capital, managerial, and technical assets from its home country to the host

country. The investment cash flows of FDIs are subject to a variety of factors,
including taxes in host countries, regulations that may block the repatriation of
MNCs’ cash flow, various business and financial risks, and the application of a
local cost of capital.
The capital structures of MNCs differ from those of purely domestic firms
because of the MNCs’ access to the Euromarket and the financial instruments it
offers, their ability to reduce risk in their cash flows through international diver-
sification, and the impact of factors unique to each host country. MNCs can
raise long-term debt by issuing international bonds in various currencies.
Foreign bonds are sold primarily in the country of the currency of issue;
Eurobonds are sold primarily in countries other than the country of the issue’s
currency. MNCs can raise equity through sale of shares in international capital
markets or through joint ventures. In establishing foreign subsidiaries, it may be
more advantageous to issue debt than MNC-owned equity.
Discuss the role of the Eurocurrency market in short-term borrowing
and investing (lending) and the basics of international cash, credit, and inven-
tory management. Eurocurrency markets allow multinationals to invest (lend)
and raise (borrow) short-term funds in a variety of currencies and to protect
themselves against exchange rate risk. MNCs consider effective interest rates,
which take into account currency fluctuations, in making investment and bor-
rowing decisions. MNCs invest in the currency with the highest effective rate
and borrow in the currency with the lowest effective rate. MNCs must offer
competitive credit terms and maintain adequate inventories to provide timely
delivery to foreign buyers. Obtaining the backing of foreign governments is
helpful to MNCs in effectively managing credit and inventory.
Review recent trends in international mergers and joint ventures.
International mergers and joint ventures, including international holding compa-
nies, increased significantly beginning in the 1980s. Special factors affecting
these mergers include economic and trade conditions and various regulations
imposed on MNCs by host countries.

International investment diversification
The economies of the world tend to rise
and fall in cycles that offset each other. International stocks can provide possible
diversification for a portfolio heavy on U.S. equities. Because research on foreign
companies is usually difficult for individual investors to track on their own, a
foreign equity mutual fund offers the investor the expertise of a global fund
manager.
Foreign-stock funds provide exposure to overseas markets at varying levels of
risk. Economic and currency risk can swing in a positive or negative direction.

Hence, diversification is the key to managing risk. Funds that invest overseas fall into
four basic categories: global, international, emerging-market, and country-specific.
The wider the reach of the fund, the less risky it is likely to be.

Integrative Case 8
Organic Solutions
O
rganic Solutions (OS), one of the nation’s largest plant wholesalers in the south-
eastern United States, was poised for expansion. Through strong profitability, a
conservative dividend policy, and some recent realized gains in real estate, OS had a
strong cash position and was searching for a target company to acquire. The execu-
tive members on the acquisition search committee had agreed that they preferred to
find a firm in a similar line of business rather than one that would provide broad
diversification. This would be their first acquisition, and they preferred to stay in a
familiar line of business. Jennifer Morgan, director of marketing, had identified the
targeted lines of business through exhaustive market research.
Ms. Morgan had determined that the servicing of plants in large commercial
offices, hotels, zoos, and theme parks would complement the existing wholesale dis-
tribution business. Frequently, OS was requested by its large clients to bid on a
service contract. However, the company was neither staffed nor equipped to enter
this market. Ms. Morgan was familiar with the major plant service companies in the
Southeast and had suggested Green Thumbs, Inc. (GTI), as an acquisition target
because of its significant market share and excellent reputation.
GTI had successfully commercialized a market that had been dominated by small
local contractors and in-house landscaping departments. Beginning with a contract
from one of the largest theme parks in the United States, GTI’s growth in sales had
compounded remarkably over its 8-year history. GTI had also been selected because of
its large portfolio of long-term service contracts with several major Fortune 500 compa-
nies. These contracted clients would provide a captive customer base for the wholesale
distribution of OS’s plant products.
At the National Horticultural meeting in Los Angeles this past March, Ms.
Morgan and OS’s chief financial officer, Jack Levine, had approached the owner of
GTI (a closely held corporation) to determine whether a merger offer would be wel-
comed. GTI’s majority owner and president, Herb Merrell, had reacted favorably and
subsequently provided financial data, including GTI’s earnings record and current
balance sheet. This data is presented in Tables 1 (below) and 2 (on the next page).
Jack Levine had estimated that the incremental cash inflow after taxes from 
the acquisition would be $18,750,000 for years 1 and 2; $20,500,000 for year 3;
$21,750,000 for year 4; $24,000,000 for year 5; and $25,000,000 for years 6 through
30. He also estimated that the company should earn a rate of return of at least 16% on
an investment of this type. Additional financial data for 2012 are given in Table 3.

a. What is the maximum price that Organic Solutions should offer GTI for a cash
acquisition? (Note: Assume the relevant time horizon for analysis is 30 years.)
b. If OS planned to sell bonds to finance 80% of the cash acquisition price found in
part a, how might issuance of each of the following bonds affect the firm?
Describe the characteristics and pros and cons of each bond:
(1) Straight bonds.
(2) Convertible bonds.
(3) Bonds with stock purchase warrants attached.
c. (1) What is the ratio of exchange in a stock swap acquisition if OS pays $30 per
share for GTI? Explain why.
(2) What effect will this swap of stock have on the EPS of the original share-
holders of (i) Organic Solutions and (ii) Green Thumbs, Inc.? Explain why.
(3) If the earnings attributed to GTI’s assets grow at a much slower rate than
those attributed to OS’s premerger assets, what effect might this have on the
EPS of the merged firm over the long run?
d. What other merger proposals could OS make to GTI’s owners?
e. What impact would the fact that GTI is actually a foreign-based company have
on the foregoing analysis? Describe the added regulations, costs, benefits, and
risks that are likely to be associated with such an international merger.

d. In part b we can see that, in each of the six years, the operating cash flow 
is positive, which means that the firm is generating cash that it could use to
invest in fixed assets or working capital, or it could distribute some of the
cash flow to investors by paying interest or dividends. The free cash flow
(FCF) calculated in part c for year 6 represents the cash flow available to
investors—providers of debt and equity—after covering all operating needs
and paying for net fixed asset investment (NFAI) and net current asset 
investment (NCAI) that occurred during the year.
 = $103,500* - $0 - $16,000 = $87,500
 FCF = OCF - NFAI - NCAI

($40,000 + $8,000) = $52,000 - $48,000 = $4,000

b. The percent-of-sales method may underestimate actual 2013 pro forma
income by assuming that all costs are variable. If the firm has fixed costs,
which by definition would not increase with increasing sales, the 2013 pro

at the given 4% rate results in the highest future value as a result of the cor-
responding highest effective annual rate.
d. Bank D:
This alternative is better than Bank C; it results in a higher future value because
of the use of continuous compounding, which with otherwise identical cash
flows always results in the highest future value of any compounding period.

a. On the surface, annuity Y looks more attractive than annuity X because it
provides $1,000 more each year than does annuity X. Of course, the fact
that X is an annuity due means that the $9,000 would be received at the
beginning each year, unlike the $10,000 at the end of each year, and this
makes annuity X more appealing than it otherwise would be.
b. Annuity X:

Annuity Y:
(Calculator solution
$87,537.38)
c. Annuity X is more attractive because its future value at the end of year 6,
FV6, of $90,603.90 is greater than annuity Y’s end-of-year-6 future value,
FV6, of $87,540.00. The subjective assessment in part a was incorrect. The
benefit of receiving annuity X’s cash inflows at the beginning of each year
appears to have outweighed the fact that annuity Y’s annual cash inflow,
which occurs at the end of each year, is $1,000 larger ($10,000 vs. $9,000)
than annuity X’s.

Because if rd

M, try rd
10%.
Because $1,082.00
$1,150, try rd
9%.
Because the $1,175.11 value at 9% is higher than $1,150, and the $1,082.00
value at 10% rate is lower than $1,150, the bond’s yield to maturity must be
between 9% and 10%. Because the $1,175.11 value is closer to $1,150,
rounding to the nearest whole percent, the YTM is 9%. (By using interpola-
tion, the more precise YTM value is 9.27%.)
(Calculator solution
9.26%)
c. The YTM of 9.27% is below both the bond’s 11% coupon interest rate and
its current yield of 9.57% calculated in part a, because the bond’s market
value of $1,150 is above its $1,000 par value. Whenever a bond’s market
value is above its par value (it sells at a premium), its YTM and current yield
will be below its coupon interest rate; when a bond sells at par, the YTM and
current yield will equal its coupon interest rate; and when the bond sells for
less than par (at a discount), its YTM and current yield will be greater than
its coupon interest rate. Observe also that the current yield measures the
bond’s coupon payment relative to its current price. When the bond sells at a
premium, its YTM will be below its current yield because the YTM also takes
into account that the bondholder will receive just $1,000 back at maturity,
which represents a loss relative to the bond’s current market price. In other
words, the YTM is measuring both the value of the coupon payment that the
investor receives (just like the current yield does) and the “loss” that the
bondholder endures when the bond matures.

Project N is recommended because it has the shorter payback period and the
higher NPV, which is greater than zero, and the larger IRR, which is greater
than the 14% cost of capital.
e. Net present value profiles:
From the NPV profile that follows, it can be seen that if the firm has a cost
of capital below approximately 6% (exact value is 5.75%), conflicting rank-
ings of the projects would exist using the NPV and IRR decision techniques.
Because the firm’s cost of capital is 14%, it can be seen in part d that no con-
flict exists.

are fewer shares of stock outstanding (483,871 shares versus 500,000 shares)
to divide up the firm’s $2,000,000 of available earnings.
f.
In both cases, the stockholders would receive $2 per share—a $2 cash divi-
dend in the dividend case or an approximately $2 increase in share price
($60.00 per share to $61.95 per share) in the repurchase case. (Note: The
difference of $0.05 per share ($2.00
$1.95) is due to rounding.)

c. Comparing the EPS without the proposed merger calculated in part a (see
column 5 of table in part a) with the EPS with the proposed merger calcu-
lated in part b (see column 7 of table in part b), we can see that after 2014,
the EPS with the merger rises above the EPS without the merger. Clearly, over
the long run, the EPS with the merger will exceed those without the merger.
This outcome is attributed to the higher rate of growth associated with
Butler’s earnings (10% versus 5% for Lake).
