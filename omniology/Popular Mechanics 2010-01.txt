JACK DIEHL
VERO BEACH, FL 
I muÔ¨Ü obje to your review of 
the Smart car in a recent teÔ¨Ü. 
I‚Äôve been driving a Smart 
Passion for about six months 
and Ô¨Ånd the ride smooth‚Äî
nothing like your expert claims. 
I also Ô¨Ånd it‚Äôs powerful enough 
for any hill, roomy and juÔ¨Ü 
plain fun to drive. Plus, it‚Äôs 
averaging 42 mpg on the 
highway and 38 in the city. I‚Äôve 
taken it on some pretty gnarly 
back roads, and it‚Äôs performed 
above expeations.

Hard-Wired Home 
I was glad to see your Ô¨Üory on 
inÔ¨Üalling Ethernet cable to 
increase a home network‚Äôs 
bandwidth. Having juÔ¨Ü wired 
my house, I have to point out 
something I learned: I found 
that the order of the wires does 
make a diÔ¨Äerence. ough logic 
told me your way made 
sense‚Äîbe consiÔ¨Üent from end 
to end‚Äîmy computers would 
recognize a conneion but 
could not transmit a signal. 
Hope readers Ô¨Ånd this helpful. 
DJ ROFF
NEW CASTLE, DE
EDITOR‚ÄôS NOTE: e wires 
inside an Ethernet cable are all 
physically the same, so it 
should transmit a signal as long 
as the color coding is identical 
at both ends, which is our 
experience. But, it makes sense 
to arrange them according to 
the U.S. Ô¨Üandard, since 
inÔ¨Üallation takes the same 
amount of time. Plus, it‚Äôll make 
splicing or repair easier.
Engineering the Future
I agree 100 percent with Dean 
Kamen, recipient of a 2009 
Popular Mechanics Break-
through Award (Nov. ‚Äò09), when 
it comes to the United States‚Äô 
need for more hands-on 
learning. 
roughout high school I 
looked forward to college, 
thinking I would Ô¨Ånally have the 
chance to praice the theory I 
was learning. But aer I got 
there, I did not have the 
opportunities I had expeed‚Äî
it was juÔ¨Ü more lab reports and 
textbook homework. I couldn‚Äôt 
even use the machine shops to 
make parts for a robot I was 
building on my own time. With 
juÔ¨Ü one semeÔ¨Üer le before I 
complete my B.S. in engineer-
ing, the only things I have built 
are a model of a lathe and a 
small aluminum truss. 
ere has to be hands-on 
learning in schools and 
universities, or Ô¨Üudents will  
lose intereÔ¨Ü in science and 
technology. Right now I am 
trying to decide if I want to go 
to graduate school next fall. 
But if it‚Äôs juÔ¨Ü going to be more 
of the same, why bother?
DAVID HOFF
ELKHART, IN
I have witnessed Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü-hand the 
spark that Mr. Kamen‚Äôs FIRST 
Lego League can create in a 
child‚Äîit‚Äôs unlike anything else. 
e child discovers that he has 
the power to create what 
doesn‚Äôt exiÔ¨Ü, to inÔ¨Çuence the 
world in a positive way. It‚Äôs 
really amazing. Dean: You are 
greater than the sum of your 
own aions. You‚Äôve inspired 
the aions of others and there 
is simply no greater accom-
plishment.

Engineers at the University 
of Missouri recently 
unveiled a nuclear-powered 
battery that is about the size of a 
penny‚Äîand they hope to produce 
one thinner than a human hair. e 
researchers do not design pocket 
reaors: e batteries harveÔ¨Ü 
elericity from the emissions of 
decaying radioaive isotopes. 
Long-laÔ¨Üing nuclear batteries are 
currently used in spacecra, but 
the relatively large size of their 
semiconduors limits their use. 
Solid semiconduors need extra 
girth because radiation breaks 
down the matrix that holds the 
material together, but liquid 
semiconduors withÔ¨Üand the 
exposure because they have no 
such Ô¨Üruure. e batteries could 
be used in miniature internal 
medical devices, remote sensors 
and other hard-to-recharge 
applications.  ‚Äî ALEX HUTCHINSON  
‚Üê  Scorned as a weed, the dandelion is a potential source of 
natural rubber, according to scientiÔ¨Üs at the Fraunhofer 
InÔ¨Üitute in Munich, Germany. e white liquid that seeps 
from a broken dandelion Ô¨Üalk is natural latex, but the sap is 
ill-suited for induÔ¨Ürial use because it immediately begins to 
harden. e researchers identiÔ¨Åed an enzyme in the plant 
that causes this rapid polymerization and found that 
the sap can produce Ô¨Åve times more latex if the 
enzyme is chemically ‚Äúturned oÔ¨Ä.‚Äù Dandelions might 
make an attraive backup as a rampaging fungus attacks 
rubber trees in SoutheaÔ¨Ü Asia, where the vaÔ¨Ü majority of 
the world‚Äôs natural rubber is now grown.

gases are taking a toll on the already unimpressive eÔ¨Éciency of 
coal-power plants. For example, experimental carbon-capture and

e United States Air Force is the beÔ¨Ü trained and moÔ¨Ü expensively 
equipped in the world. So what is there to worry about? Plenty, says  
Lt. Gen. David Deptula, the USAF‚Äôs deputy chief of Ô¨ÜaÔ¨Ä for intelligence, surveil-
lance and reconnaissance. U.S. warplanes are not threatened by insurgents, but 
other potential foes are developing hardware that could change the equation. 
Discussing such threats in public, as Deptula did during a recent brieÔ¨Ång outside 
Washington, D.C., is a familiar taic to drum up government support, but public 
brieÔ¨Ångs are also opportunities for key Air Force oÔ¨Écials to honeÔ¨Üly Ô¨Üate their top 
priorities to defense contraors, academics and uniformed service members.

Too Much 
Information
 
Hard drives could reach their limits by 2015 unless researchers can 
Ô¨Ånd new ways to cram more information onto their disks. ese drives use 
elerical pulses to create magnetic patterns on grains Ô¨Üored in rings on disks; 
when the disks spin, a scanner reads the patterns of elerical resiÔ¨Üivity to 
retrieve the information. e Ô¨Üorage capacity of the hard drive has risen from 
less than 0.1 gigabits (Gb) per square inch to over 100 Gb per square inch today. 
One breakthrough is ‚Äúperpendicular recording,‚Äù which adds a bottom layer of 
magnetically weaker material to the disk, allowing it to Ô¨Üore extra information. 
However, consumers‚Äô need for more space to Ô¨Üore 
videos, commercial information and experimental data 
is outpacing hard-drive development, so designers are 
seeking new ways to satisfy this growing appetite.

could examine 
never-before-seen 
interaions as 
they happen, like 
these white blood 
cells battling a 
larval parasite.
¬í Eleron microscopes can see things 1000 times smaller 
than what is visible with light microscopes, but they have a large 
limitation: ey create doses of radiation that kill any microorgan-
ism being examined. Researchers at MIT have proposed an 
alternative that uses two Ô¨Üacked rings to divert the eleron 
beam above or below the specimen, never Ô¨Üriking it direly. 
Elerons would easily hop from ring to ring until an obje placed 
between the loops traps elerons on one side or the other. e 
microscope would then regiÔ¨Üer a dark spot. Combining the dark 
and light points would create a detailed black-and-white image. 
e new microscope could produce the Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü ‚Äúlive‚Äù images of 
biological phenomena, such as the chemical processes of white 
blood cells or even the individual nucleic acids in DNA. An early 
prototype could be operational within the next Ô¨Åve years.

the read/write head 
could identify 
patterns when 
adjacent tracks 
intera, and pluck 
the corre data 
from the interac-
tion, the Ô¨Üorage 
potential of a disk 
would be increased.

designer baby: n.
A baby whose genetic makeup has been selected 
in order to remove a particular defect, or to 
ensure that a particular gene is present.
‚Äî Oxford American Dictionary
For juÔ¨Ü an extra few thousand dollars, women undergoing in vitro fertil-
ization (IVF) could one day choose to have a baby boy with perfe vision, 
an aptitude for sports and a virtual lock on avoiding colon cancer. Fertility clinics 
in the U.S. currently oÔ¨Äer not only to screen for diseases, but also to choose 
gender. They are not yet offering any further customization, but that could 
change as genetic mapping gets faÔ¨Üer and easier. LaÔ¨Ü year, a California com-
pany said it could screen for hair and skin color, but soon retraed the claim 
amid a Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Üorm of proteÔ¨Ü. (Research like this has prompted Pope Benedi to 
condemn ‚Äúthe obsessive search for the perfe child.‚Äù) e beÔ¨Ü screening teÔ¨Ü 
on the market is called preimplantation genetic diagnosis. PGD, developed to 
prevent births of children with severe disorders, screens chromosomes from 
one or two of an embryo‚Äôs cells for abnormalities. Depending on the results, the 
IVF embryo is either implanted in the mother, donated for research or deÔ¨Üroyed. 
Now, researchers at the privately run Genetics & IVF InÔ¨Üitute in Virginia have 
developed a teÔ¨Ü called karyomapping. e new procedure compares the  genetic 
maps of parents and embryos to dete 15,000 known genetic disorders. It 
could also be used to choose traits including intelligence or skin color. ‚Äúe 
future of genetic screening will really depend on what people want,‚Äù Elizabeth 
Ginsburg, the former president of the Society for AssiÔ¨Üed Reproduive Tech-
nology, says. ‚ÄúIf that means creating so-called designer babies, we‚Äôre going to 
need a lot more regulation.‚Äù

A fan with no blades? e Dyson Air Multiplier Fan 
($300 for the 10-inch model, $330 for the 12-inch) does 
away with spinning spokes. How it works: e machine 
sucks air into its base before forcing it up around the hoop 
and through narrow slits. To beef up the breeze, it sucks in 
extra air from the back, side and front of the fan. e 
advantage: even airÔ¨Çow, no blades to clean and an 
unlimited number of speed settings (moÔ¨Ü fans have only 
two or three modes). But seriously, if you are that con-
cerned with the shortcomings of a fan, you‚Äôve probably 
already bought an air conditioner. e real magic of this 
thing is its ability to induce ‚Äúoohs‚Äù and ‚Äúaahs‚Äù when you Ô¨Üick 
your hand through the hoop. And we cannot wait until they 
build this tech into a large sci-Ô¨Å ceiling fan.  ‚Äî SETH PORGES

worth the trouble. A possible solution: integrated solar panels, 
like the ones built into the Samsung Blue Earth Phone, which 
was recently released in Europe and could be coming to the 
U.S. soon. ese solar cells might make the phone seem like an 
environmental trailblazer, but it takes 15 hours of sunlight to 
fully charge the phone‚Äôs battery. is anemic draw makes the 
integrated panels useful only as a backup power supply.

Chalk this one up to the rule of 
unintended consequences: Aer 
2007‚Äôs tainted-toy epidemic, 
Congress quickly passed the 
Consumer Produ Safety 
Improvement A of 2008, a law 
aimed at scrubbing lead from 
produs marketed primarily for 
children ages 12 and under, such 
as toys, clothing and bicycles. But 
the far-reaching law may do more 
than get unsafe toys oÔ¨Ä the 
market. It may also put some 
toymakers out of business. 
In short, the law bans produs 
that contain lead in concentrations 
of 300 parts per million or more in 
places that can easily be touched 
by a child. In order to prove that a 
toy is lead-free, toymakers muÔ¨Ü 
spend $300 to $4000 per produ 
in teÔ¨Üs‚Äîan amount of little 
consequence to big companies  
but a major coÔ¨Ü for small-batch, 
independent toymakers. ‚ÄúPeople 
who do this as a hobby are done,‚Äù 
says toy seller Dan Marshall, who 
founded the Handmade Toy

e law could also cause makers of 
essentially harmless produs to move 
overseas to avoid the regulation. ‚ÄúWhy 
not go where we‚Äôre wanted?‚Äù Ian 
Smith, president of OSET dirt bikes, 
says. His company‚Äôs kid-size bikes 
contain small amounts of lead in the 
brake levers. Smith recently moved his 
business from Denver to England. 
For its part, the Consumer Produ 
Safety Commission, tasked with 
enforcing the CPSIA, says that the law 
can be implemented Ô¨Çexibly, and notes 
that it doesn‚Äôt aÔ¨Äe produs that may 
simply fall into the hands of children‚Äî
such as ballpoint pens. ‚ÄúWe want to 
Ô¨Ånd praical ways to keep small 
businesses open,‚Äù Scott Wolfson, a 
spokesman for the CPSC, says. And the

 Now why didn‚Äôt we think of that? 
When we iron, we iron pointy end 
forward in order to navigate around 
buttons and minimize crumpling. 
But if an iron had two pointy ends ...

PM: How did you create 
Mario? When was it 
decided that he should be 
a plumber? 
 e Ô¨Üory of creating Mario 
goes all the way back to 
Donkey Kong, where he Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü 
appeared. With the 
technology back then, you 
had a very limited palette in 
which you were able to draw 
a charaer. If you look at the 
original Mario, you had juÔ¨Ü 
seven pixels to draw his face. 
My goal within that limited 
palette was to create a 
charaer that was as 
diÔ¨Üin as possible. Because 
of that, he had some of his 
now-diÔ¨Üin features, such 
as his big nose. 
At Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü, I kind of looked at 
Mario as your average, 
everyday foolish guy. e 
setting of Donkey Kong was 
a conÔ¨Üruion site, so I kind 
of matched him with the 
setting of the game, and 
decided in that game that 
he was a carpenter. And 
then we made the original 
Mario Bros. game, which 
was the Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü game that had 
pipes in it. Looking at the 
setting of that game, it had 
the feeling of, like, an 
underground New York 
sewer syÔ¨Üem. And so I 
thought: What kind of guy 
would be there working on 
the pipes? A plumber! 
PM: Aer playing these 
games, we have to wonder: 
Did anybody ever throw 
barrels or Ô¨Åreballs at you 
when you were growing up?
 Nobody ever threw barrels 
at me, but I did read a lot of 
manga comics in Japan and 
see a lot of cartoons and 
you‚Äôd oen see silly things like 
that happening.
PM: Do you create back-
ground Ô¨Üories for  
the charaers that maybe 
aren‚Äôt known to the  
public or presented in  
the games? 
 For the moÔ¨Ü part we don‚Äôt 
create very in-depth back 
Ô¨Üories for the charaers. I 
think the Zelda games and 
Ocarina of Time in particular 
may be somewhat diÔ¨Äerent in 
that we did think heavily 
about who are all the 
charaers in the world, and 
what is their relationship to 
one another, and how does 
that play out in the Ô¨Üory. But 
taking games like the Super 
Mario Bros. series in particu-
lar, typically when we design 
a charaer it‚Äôs based on their 
funion within the interaive 
gameplay world. So, for 
example, charaers that 
have spikes are charaers 
you cannot jump on. In that 
sense it‚Äôs not so much 
designing a charaer as it is 
designing their funion 
within the world.
e noÔ¨Üalgia-inducing, side-scrolling aion of the New Super Mario 
Bros. Wii should be familiar to fans of the classic Mario games. e 
diÔ¨Äerence? Up to four players can now simultaneously run, jump and 
dive down pipes in pursuit of coins‚Äîand the princess.
THE MIND OF NINTENDO VISIONARY SHIGERU 
MIYAMOTO HAS GIVEN BIRTH TO SO MANY 
CLASSIC VIDEO GAMES AND CHARACTERS, IT‚ÄôS 
NO UNDERSTATEMENT TO CALL HIM THE FATHER 
OF MODERN GAMING. FOR HIS LATEST GAME, 
NEW SUPER MARIO BROS. WII, THE 57-YEAR-OLD 
MIYAMOTO ADDED A PARTY-FRIENDLY FOUR-
PERSON MULTIPLAYER MODE TO THE SIDE-
SCROLLING, COIN-COLLECTING GAMEPLAY THAT 
FIRST MADE THE SERIES FAMOUS. WE SAT DOWN 
WITH THE CREATOR OF MARIO, ZELDA AND 
DONKEY KONG TO TALK ABOUT THE PAST AND 
FUTURE OF GAMING, AND TO TAKE HIM ON IN THE 
NEW GAME (HE SOUNDLY DESTROYED US).

PM: Where do you see the 
future of video games? 
 Video-game syÔ¨Üems were 
originally viewed as a toy, 
and they were something 
you played with. Now I think 
we‚Äôre Ô¨Üarting to see a 
blurring of the lines, where 
video games are moving 
beyond simply entertain-
ment into other aspes of 
everyday life. And I think 
what video games beneÔ¨Åt 
from is an intuitive interface 
that‚Äôs easy to underÔ¨Üand, 
with a controller that is 
maybe a little bit more 
familiar and easier to use 
than the interface of a 
typical computer. As time 
goes on, I think we‚Äôre going 
to see the video-game 
console and this interaive 
interface gradually bleed 
into other elements of home 
eleronics and daily life. For 
example, in Japan the Wii 
itself has a TV guide channel 
that Wii owners can 
download. And for a lot of 
people in Japan who own a 
Wii, that TV guide channel is 
a lot more convenient and 
easier to use than a typical 
TV guide service.

2010 GMC Terrain
Base Price: $24,995
e new Terrain could play a key role in kick-Ô¨Üarting a GM renaissance. e 
Ô¨Åve-passenger crossover is available with a 2.4-liter four-cylinder or a 3.0-liter 
V6, both mated to a six-speed automatic. An Eco mode in four-cylinder models 
recovers nearly 1 mpg‚Äîfor 32 mpg highway. Inside, we dug the laptop-size bin, 
and rear seats that can slide 8 inches or fold Ô¨Çat to provide 64 cubic feet of 
Ô¨Üorage. We noticed the deeper grain Ô¨Ånishes on the dash, higher quality 
materials and improved panel tolerances compared to its cousin, the Equinox, 
during our Michigan drive. e four-cylinder provides mild-mannered thruÔ¨Ü. But 
the Six is Ô¨Ürong, with a broad torque curve that keeps the transmission from 
hunting. If new GM models continue to be executed with the same attention to 
detail as the Terrain, the company could hit its Ô¨Üride.  ‚Äî BASEM WASEF

ree-Wheel Motion
Motorcycle touring doesn‚Äôt always 
require two wheels. We hit the roads of 
Quebec on the lateÔ¨Ü BRP three-wheeler, 
the RT-S, loaded with about 40 pounds 
of luggage and a passenger. Right oÔ¨Ä the 
line, it felt less gutsy than the Ô¨Üandard 
model. Encumbered with a passenger, 
cargo and the RT-S‚Äôs touring hardware, 
the 100-hp V-twin feels noticeably taxed. 
Yet the riding position is relaxed and 
comfortable and prolonged time in the 
saddle yields no discomfort. While it 
takes some adjuÔ¨Üing for motorcycliÔ¨Üs 
to forget techniques like counterÔ¨Üeering 
and leaning on a three-wheeler, the RT-S 
has a slightly Ô¨Üeeper learning curve. e 
added weight and large footprint don‚Äôt 
inspire frisky moves. Still, the air 
suspension was easily Ô¨ÜiÔ¨Äened and 
soened using a rocker switch, and the 
controls for the eleronic parking brake 
and heated handgrips were logically 
placed. e $24,999 RT-S isn‚Äôt cheap. 
But that three-wheel Ô¨Üability might be 
worth the price for some long haulers.

The scope of every Land Rover‚Äôs 
operation envelope is Ô¨Üriking. One 
moment you‚Äôre cruising at 80 mph on 
beautifully damped air springs, 
ensconced in so leather, the next you‚Äôre 
nearly door-handle-deep in liquid mud. 
e new LR4 we sampled in Scotland 
recently is juÔ¨Ü as capable as its 
forefathers but is now armed with a  
375-hp 5.0-liter V8 with 375 lb- of 
torque.e LR4 accelerates to 100 mph 
and then brakes to a Ô¨Üop before the 
previous model could even reach 100 
mph. is is Ô¨Üill a big, heavy vehicle. But 
the torquey engine, smooth transmission 
and smart suspension team up to 
provide poise and agility that belie the 
5800-pound avoirdupois. e LR4 is able 
to glide along the freeways and country 
lanes with luxury-sedan competence, 
then pump itself up to crawl the Rubicon 
Trail. ough at $48,100, few will likely 
teÔ¨Ü that capability.  ‚Äî BARRY WINFIELD

Pickup trucks may be

2011 Super Duty 
promises to pull even 
more weight, thanks to 
an all-new 6.7-liter 
Power Stroke diesel. 
ough Ford has not yet 
announced how much 
thruÔ¨Ü this new engine

heard peak torque 
should climb north of an

e heart of these 
sport machines may 
be V8 engines, but the BMW and the 
Chevrolet powerplants are vaÔ¨Üly 
diÔ¨Äerent. e M3‚Äôs is a technological 
marvel, allowing a hair-raising 8400-
rpm rev limit and packing 103.5 hp per 
liter of displacement. at level of 
power density wouldn‚Äôt be out of place 
in a race car. Our M3 was equipped with 
the optional $2900 seven-speed 
dual-clutch transmission. And drivers 
can dial the shi speed from couch-
potato lazy to riÔ¨Çe quick. ere are also 
adjuÔ¨Üments for Ô¨Üeering eÔ¨Äort, throttle 
sensitivity and even shock-absorber 
Ô¨ÜiÔ¨Äness. If the M3 is the bleeding-edge 
tech geek, the Corvette is the old-school 
barroom bruiser. Its V8 uses pushrods 
and two valves per cylinder like Chevy‚Äôs 
original small-block V8‚Äî55 years ago. 
But the throttle response is very quick, 
and with fewer parts, it‚Äôs a lighter 
engine. A six-speed automatic is 
available, but we chose the Ô¨Üandard 
six-speed manual. 
is was a close 
call. It‚Äôs polish 
versus outright 
performance, 
praicality 
versus the 
singular mission. 
Both cars 
provide, in 
diÔ¨Äerent ways, 
the visceral rush 
that we crave. 
But the BMW‚Äôs 
back seat, 
beautiful interior 
and reÔ¨Ånement 
mean we would 
want to drive 
the M3 far more 
oen. It‚Äôs our 
choice. 
e M3 is heavier than 
the Corvette and has 
less power, so naturally it was outgunned 
at the dragÔ¨Ürip. However, the M3 does 
have a launch-control syÔ¨Üem, so it‚Äôs the 
consiÔ¨Üency king. But as speeds rise, the 
Corvette‚Äôs lighter weight and better 
aerodynamics widen the gap. e Vette‚Äôs 
Ô¨Üraight-line speed and higher grip 
translate into a faÔ¨Üer racetrack lap. Out 
in the wild, the BMW carves corners 
brilliantly, expertly kniÔ¨Ång into apexes.
As for the Vette, the Grand Sport is one 
very crisp and very planted sports car. On 
the Ô¨Üreet, you are unlikely to outdrive 
this chassis. But as good as the Grand 
Sport may be, it does suÔ¨Äer from a 
diÔ¨Üinly low-rent interior, especially 
compared to the luxurious BMW‚Äôs. e 
Vette‚Äôs removable roof creaked and 
groaned over sharp bumps. In contraÔ¨Ü, 
the BMW‚Äôs vault-like Ô¨Üruure was in 
another class.

Praically Stunning
Crossovers may dominate the 
automotive landscape, but the far cooler 
way to pack utility into a car chassis is: 
Use an aual car. Today‚Äôs sporty wagons 
are the contrarian family conveyance. 
And Cadillac‚Äôs sport wagon is one of the 
beÔ¨Ü in class. Mechanically, it diÔ¨Äers little 
from the CTS sedan, oÔ¨Äering a choice of 
rear- or all-wheel drive, two V6 engines 
and Ô¨Üandard six-speed automatic. e 
200 pounds of metal and glass behind 
the rear doors provide 25 cubic feet of 
Ô¨Üowage and 58 cubic feet with the seat 
folded. We used the wagon for our 
weekend chores and found thoughtful 
touches throughout the cargo area. A 
concealed area a few inches deep 
beneath the Ô¨Çoor is covered by a clever 
folding lid that can be propped in 
diÔ¨Äerent positions to keep smaller items 
from sliding around. Need to carry even 
more Ô¨ÜuÔ¨Ä? e roof rack can be 
equipped with optional accessories. 
BeÔ¨Ü of all, the $40,485 Caddy oÔ¨Äers a 
luxurious and entertaining driving 
experience. ‚Äî KEVIN A. WILSON

At September‚Äôs Frankfurt Motor Show, it seemed 
that recent economic woes have only served to 
Ô¨Ürengthen the ingenuity of carmakers. e halls 
were packed with innovation, including mpg-booÔ¨Ü-
ing solutions ranging from the right-here-and-now to 
the diÔ¨Üant future. And what of the future of fuel‚Äî
will plug-in EVs or traditional hybrids win out? 
Perhaps the moÔ¨Ü important message at the show 
was that the traditionally diesel-oriented European 
manufaurers seemed to have Ô¨Ånally embraced 
eleric and hybrid propulsion. Here‚Äôs a look at some 
of the moÔ¨Ü exciting and innovative fuel-eÔ¨Écient cars 
at the show this year.  ‚Äî JAMES TATE

iat is returning to America, and I‚Äôm glad. The 
merger of Fiat and Chrysler will elevate the Italian 
brand in this country and create some great cars. 
Fiat is known in Europe for small, fun, fuel-efÔ¨Åcient 
vehicles‚Äîcars Chrysler just does not build. 
I own two classic Fiats, a 1937 Topolino coupe, 
with a tiny 569-cc 13.5-hp four-cylinder, and a 1959 
Millecento sedan with an 1100-cc 43-hp engine. In 
America, that sedan would have been the equiva-
lent of a Ford Fairlane or a low-end Galaxie in terms 
of its stature in the automotive landscape. 
If you were a reasonably successful Italian family 
man in 1959, the Millecento was the car you would 
buy; it had four doors, a four-speed shifter on the 
column, a radio and even a two-speed heater. Oh 
my God, the options go on and on! Fiat has always 
been an innovative company.
Fiat introduced the Topolino (little mouse) in 
1936‚Äîand ultimately sold half a million of them. 
That Topolino was really the Ô¨Årst ‚Äúpeople‚Äôs car.‚Äù 
The Volkswagen Beetle didn‚Äôt come out until after 
the war. The car has brilliant packaging. It‚Äôs tiny, 
yet there‚Äôs so much headroom that 
someone 6 feet tall wearing a top hat 
could sit inside. It‚Äôs one of the few 
cars in which the generator is bigger 
than the engine. The radiator is 
behind the motor so the grille could 
be made more aerodynamic; you‚Äôd 
never see that on an American car. 
The Topolino was not powerful. Its 
top speed was only 53 mph, but it 
could carry a small family, and I can 
get close to 50 mpg in my car. Here‚Äôs 
the best part: How many car engines 
can you remove, bring inside the

house, put in your kitchen sink and 
clean? The Topolino is like a big toy, 
and it has a sense of style that the VW 
Beetle never had. 
So much about the way a car works 
has to do with where it‚Äôs from. Italian 
cars, especially Fiats and Alfa Romeos, 
were built to run in a warm climate. 
It‚Äôs no surprise that the oil passages 
tend to be small, because the oil used 
is so thin. But in freezing New Eng-
land, you‚Äôd get into your Fiat or Alfa, 
turn the key and the car would moan 
whhrrrrrmmmm, whhrrrrrmmmm. And 
you‚Äôd have to press the throttle half-
way down three or four times to warm 
up the car because you‚Äôre forcing 
heavy, thick oil through tiny passages. 
This slow-Ô¨Çowing oil tended to starve 
the bearings, and a lot of engines in 
these cars seized prematurely. The 
trick to owning an Italian car, or any 
older European car, is to start it, wait 
2 minutes, or until the gauges move 
off their stops, then go. 
In Europe, if you owned a car in 
the ‚Äô50s and ‚Äô60s, you were consid-
ered a major success. Consequently, 
you treated your automobile the way 
you treated your home; it was trea-
sured and taken care of. Whereas in 
America, at that time, we could buy 
used cars that actually ran for about 
50 bucks. Our cars tended to be a lit-
tle overbuilt and a lot more durable. 
We didn‚Äôt have a ‚Äúliter tax‚Äù on engine 
size, and we didn‚Äôt have high gas 
prices. Our cars had big, heavy, slow-
revving (really slow-revving) engines 
that would last forever‚Äîor at least 
100,000 miles. 
European cars were high-revving, 
and they didn‚Äôt spend 
all day on the free-
way. If you had 
told someone in 
1959 that a Fiat 
could run 75 mph 
for 5 hours straight, 
all the way from L.A. 
to Vegas, forget 
it‚Äîthey wouldn‚Äôt 
have believed you. 
The thing would 
implode. It just wasn‚Äôt 
built for the American mar-
ket, and Fiat sold cars here 
without Americanizing 
them. In that sense, they 
were not very good cars. 
In the ‚Äô50s and ‚Äô60s, 
anything built outside our 
borders was considered 
suspect and of poor qual-
ity. Fiat used low-grade 
steel, which led to severe 
rusting. And it didn‚Äôt have 
particularly good cus-
tomer service. A lot of my friends had 
Fiat 124s from the late ‚Äô60s and early 
‚Äô70s. I thought they were fantastic 
cars for the money‚Äîbut you had to 
know someone who knew how to Ô¨Åx 
them. You had Americans working 
on them with American wrenches, 
trying to put an American thread bolt 
in a metric hole‚Äîand then it leaked 
oil. Why is thaaat? 
People over the age of 55 hear the 
name Fiat and think, ‚ÄúFix It Again 
Tony.‚Äù Younger people have never 
heard that phrase. The younger gen-
erations tend to look to Europe and 
Japan for quality products. So I think 
enough time has passed, and people 
don‚Äôt have those negative associa-
tions with Fiat anymore. When I was 
a kid, my dad called a Fiat or a 
Mercedes-Benz ‚Äúthose foreign jobs.‚Äù 
He‚Äôd say: ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt get parts 
for that. It‚Äôs a foreign job. 
You need an Italian 
mechanic.‚Äù Till the 
day he died, my 
father thought Japa-
nese brands like 
Honda and Sony 
were like the little bamboo umbrel-
las that come in your drink. To him, 
those countries had lost the war, and 
they made crummy products. Even-
tually, that generation moved on.
In the near future, I think we‚Äôll see 
boutique Fiat dealerships. If you want 
to buy a new Fiat 500, you‚Äôll go to a 
cute little store and buy the cool jacket 
and the hat, and even the little 
espresso machine. Some people say 
the last thing we need is a new name-
plate, but we‚Äôve been losing brands 
since 1912. Everybody laments the 
passing of Pontiac and Oldsmobile, 
but when I was a kid, it was DeSoto, 
then Nash, Rambler, Studebaker and 
Hudson. We lost more brands in the 
early ‚Äô60s than we have now.
So I wish ‚Äôem luck. Competition is 
good. The Corvette ZR1 wouldn‚Äôt be 
around if it hadn‚Äôt been for the Viper. 
(‚ÄúHey, it‚Äôs got 500 horsepower, that‚Äôs 
enough, right?‚Äù) The more players, 
the better the game. If the Red Sox 
played the Yankees every year, it 
would get pretty boring.

ive years ago this February, Aaron Cypess had an 
epiphany about fat. A fellow in endocrinology at 
Boston‚Äôs Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, 
Cypess happened to be attending a lecture in 
which a doctor presented images of human PET 
scans. At one point, Cypess recalls, the doctor indi-
cated an area corresponding to the neck and said, 
rather dismissively, ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs brown fat.‚Äù Cypess 
was taken aback. After the lecture, he approached 
the doctor and told him he must have been mis-
taken: Everyone knows there‚Äôs no brown fat in 
human adults. The doctor responded, ‚ÄúYeah, there 
is. We see it all the time.‚Äù Cypess paused. ‚ÄúWait a 
minute,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù
Brown fat has long been known to exist in infants 
and animals such as mice, but until recently scien-
tists thought it disappeared before human adult-
hood, leaving only the white fat that‚Äôs associated 
with weight gain. Unlike white fat, which stores 
energy, chestnut-colored brown fat burns it. Brown 
fat cells contain a large supply of organelles called 
mitochondria, and an enzyme that allows them to 
release energy from food calories 
directly as heat. This spring, multiple 
studies in The New England Journal  
of Medicine‚Äîincluding one co-
authored by Cypess, now a research 
associate at the Joslin Diabetes Cen-
ter in Boston‚Äîconfirmed that not 
only is brown fat common in adults, 
it‚Äôs also important to metabolism: 
Younger, thinner people have more 
detectable brown fat than their older, 
pudgier counterparts. 
As it turns out, doctors are still 
discovering how fat works. Rather 
than just a blubbery, lifeless mass, 
fat is now considered to be a sophis-
ticated and scientifically complex 
biological organ, as important to 
the body as the liver or the kidneys. 
Scientists believe that fat secretes 
hormones and signaling molecules 
that coordinate behavior and health. 
White fat also plays a signiÔ¨Åcant role 
in the immune system: A study pub-
lished in August in the journal 
 Immunity concluded that fat drop-
lets help protect the body against 
immune-system invaders. A 2008 
study published in Cell Metabolism 
found that the fat that accumulates 
around the thighs and hips, called 
subcutaneous fat, actually lowers 
risk of diabetes. ‚ÄúWe were taught 
that white fat was something that 
stores energy very efficiently, and 
that‚Äôs it,‚Äù Cypess says. ‚ÄúFat has 
undergone a renaissance.‚Äù
Despite this new perspective,  
doctors agree that most people  
have a lot more white fat than they 
need. A whopping 34 percent of 
Americans over the age of 20 are 
obese, and much of the fat that accu-
mulates on an obese body is visceral:

It surrounds vital organs and increases 
the risk of diabetes, as well as cancer 
and stroke. For these people, the dis-
covery of brown fat, which is concen-
trated in the neck and chest, provides 
a glimmer of hope. Scientists have now 
begun to think about fat as a potential 
treatment for conditions such as obe-
sity, rather than just a cause.
q	

¬í Cypess‚Äôs research has shown 
that, besides young, thin people, 
women are twice as likely as men to 
have significant amounts of active 
brown fat‚Äîperhaps because with less 
muscle mass, they need brown fat to 
stay warm. In fact, temperature seems 
to be an important controller of brown 
fat activity. A team led by Sven Ener-
b√§ck, a medical geneticist at the  
University of Gothenburg in Sweden, 
found that when subjects spent  
2 hours in a cold room wearing thin 
clothing and intermittently soaking 
their feet in ice water, their brown fat 
burned 15 times more energy than it 
did at room temperature. One subject 
had enough brown fat to lose 8 to 9 
pounds per year. Dutch researchers 
found active brown fat in 23 out of 24 
subjects when they were cold, but not 
when they were warm. And research  
at the University of Nottingham in 
England revealed brown fat activity 
was closely associated with seasonal 
decreases in daylight as well. 
Animal studies also suggest brown 
fat boosts weight loss. Last year, Stock-
holm University scientists found that 
mice that could not make brown fat 
gained weight 50 percent faster than 
mice that could. In a 2008 study, mice 
fed a high-fat diet and kept at room 
temperature ended up nearly four 
times heavier than mice fed the same 
diet and housed at 39 F. Researchers 
estimate that just 2 ounces of active 
brown fat could burn 300 to 500 calo-
ries a day. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need much to 
have a profound effect on your body‚Äôs 
metabolism,‚Äù Cypess says.
So how do you turn brown fat on 
without having to soak your feet in ice 
water? As a postdoctoral fellow at the 
Harvard-affiliated Dana-Farber Can-
cer Institute in Boston, Patrick Seale 
identiÔ¨Åed a protein called PRDM-16 
that is present in every brown fat cell 
but absent from white fat cells. When 
he turned off PRDM-16 activity in 
young brown fat cells, they changed 
into muscle cells. Now an assistant 
professor at the University of Pennsyl-
vania School of Medicine, Seale is 
working on identifying genes that may 
turn PRDM-16 on. 
Seale‚Äôs adviser at Dana-Farber, 
Bruce Spiegelman, is testing a therapy 
that involves removing white fat pre-
cursor cells from animals, inserting 
active PRDM-16 and then transplant-
ing the cells back into the animals to 
see if they lose weight. Mitchell Lazar, 
director of the Institute for Diabetes, 
Obesity and Metabolism at the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania School of Medi-
cine, admits that the idea seems pretty 
farfetched. ‚ÄúOn the other hand, I can‚Äôt 
really think of any reason why it 
wouldn‚Äôt work,‚Äù he says. 
q
qq
qq
¬í Cypess and his colleagues are 
focusing on different proteins, includ-
ing one called BMP-7 that aids bone 
growth. (Bone communicates regu-
larly with fat.) Recently, one researcher 
found that BMP-7 increases the pro-
duction of brown fat and protects 
against obesity in mice. The U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration has already 
approved a BMP-7 drug for use in spi-
nal surgery, so Cypess is testing the 
drug‚Äôs effects on surgical patients to 
see if it boosts brown fat too. ‚ÄúIf it 
works, we‚Äôve leapfrogged past several 
years of research,‚Äù he says. 
Ultimately, what Seale and Cypess 
envision is a ‚Äúbrown fat pill‚Äù‚Äîa drug 
that boosts the activity of brown fat 
through molecular means. ‚ÄúI have 
patients who are 400 pounds,‚Äù Cypess 
says. ‚ÄúI have to Ô¨Ånd a way to help them 
out.‚Äù Of course, they realize such a 
drug won‚Äôt provide a quick Ô¨Åx for obe-
sity. But brown fat could help people 
achieve weight loss goals by burning, 
say, an extra 500 calories a day. 
Until a pill becomes available, there 
are ways for people to rev up their 
brown fat activity. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you 
could get a lot of people to put up with 
[cold] therapy,‚Äù Enerb√§ck says, but it 
could help to turn down your home‚Äôs 
central heating and to spend some 
time outside in the fall and winter. 
Studies suggest that people who work 
outdoors have higher brown fat activ-
ity than average, so it‚Äôs not absurd to 
think that walking to work on a brisk 
day could boost your metabolism. 
As scientists continue to study fat 
in a new light‚Äîas an important organ 
in the body‚Äôs endocrine system‚Äîthey 
are bound to Ô¨Ånd more opportunities. 
For example, a study published in July 
by Paul MacLean and his colleagues at 
the University of Colorado at Denver 
revealed new insight into exercise and 
weight loss: Physical activity reduces 
weight by increasing the brain‚Äôs sensi-
tivity to appetite-suppressing hor-
mones like leptin and insulin more so 
than by burning calories. According to 
MacLean, it may make the brain 
‚Äúmore receptive to what the leptin and 
insulin are trying to say.‚Äù 
Perhaps, then, it‚Äôs possible to con-
ceive of an ‚Äúexercise pill‚Äù too. Sure, it 
sounds ridiculous. But given the grav-
ity of the situation, there may not be 
any harm in being imaginative. ‚ÄúWe 
certainly need creative new ways of 
thinking about combating the obesity 
epidemic,‚Äù Enerb√§ck says.

ULTIMATELY, WHAT SEALE AND CYPESS ENVISION IS 
A ‚ÄúBROWN FAT PILL‚Äù‚ÄîA DRUG THAT BOOSTS BROWN 
FAT ACTIVITY THROUGH MOLECULAR MEANS.

For the past Ô¨Åve years, scientists at the 
University of Alberta in Edmonton 
have been working on the Human 
Metabolome Project, a database of the 
8000 naturally occurring metabolites 
(that is, small molecules involved in 
chemical reactions in the body), as 
well as 1450 drugs, 1900 food addi-
tives and 2900 toxins that turn up in 
blood and urine tests. With this infor-
mation, researchers can analyze a 
patient‚Äôs metabolomic proÔ¨Åle, allow-
ing them to tell from a drop of blood 
or urine whether somebody likes 
chocolate‚Äîor is likely to develop a

equipment that are mostly conÔ¨Åned 
to research labs. The Project‚Äôs data-

Osseointegration allows prosthetics

Traditional hydroelectricity requires

New York‚Äôs East River to prove the

for a major build-out of 30 underwater

Carbon nanotubes have been touted 
as the next big thing ever since their 
discovery in 1991. The appeal lies in 
their strength (they are up to 100 
times stronger than steel) and their 
ability to conduct both heat and elec-
tricity. But, until now, they‚Äôve been 
too difÔ¨Åcult to manufacture in useful 
quantities. That‚Äôs finally changing: 
New Hampshire‚Äìbased Nanocomp 
Technologies is weaving nanotubes 
into lengths of yarn that can be built 
into commercial applications. The 
company recently delivered more 
than 6 miles of nanoyarn to a major 
aerospace client, and successful

The biggest challenge for electric cars 
is energy storage: Batteries are better 
than ever, but they are still expensive, 
slow to charge and have fairly limited 
life spans. The solution may be ultra-
capacitors, which hold less energy 
than batteries (at least as the technol-
ogy currently stands) but have virtu-
ally none of their drawbacks. That 
means longer life spans, no messy 
chemical reactions, no issues with 
battery memory and far greater dura-
bility. Researchers have been trying 
to perfect automotive ultracapacitors 
for several years (MIT is working 
on nanotube-based ultracaps, while 
Argonne National Laboratory is 
exploring battery‚Äìultracap hybrids), 
but the big move could come from 
the secretive Texas-based company 
EEStor, which announced in April 
that its barium-titanate design had 
passed a crucial test. Though the 
company‚Äôs claims have aroused 
skepticism, EEStor‚Äôs automotive part-
ner, ZENN Motors, is hyping the 
release of an ultracapacitor-powered 
car in 2010.

Katie Spotz always considered her-
self a lousy athlete‚Äîwhich makes the 
22-year-old‚Äôs quest to become the 
youngest person ever to row solo across 
the Atlantic Ocean seem a little odd. 
‚ÄúGrowing up, I was a benchwarmer,‚Äù 
says Spotz, who competed on her high 
school swim, tennis and track teams in 
Mentor, Ohio. But after running a mar-
athon at 18, she discovered that in 
long-distance sports, mental tough-
ness matters more than physical 
strength. Spotz has cycled 3300 miles 
across the U.S. and was the Ô¨Årst person 
to swim all 352 miles of the Allegheny 
River. When she learned about ocean 
rowing, she thought it would be the 
perfect way to raise awareness about 
the 1.1 billion people who lack access 
to safe drinking water. Donations 
made at Spotz's website, rowforwater
.com, will help the Blue Planet Run 
Foundation build clean-water projects 
around the world. Now all she has to 
do is row‚ÄîSpotz starts her journey in 
late December. ‚ÄúEvery endurance event 
has that moment when everything falls 
apart,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúYou have to be 100 
percent focused and aware. That‚Äôs 
what I like about adventures like this.‚Äù

Boat design 
requires Ô¨Ånding the

mise, says Phil 
Morrison, who 
drew the plans for 
Spotz‚Äôs 19-foot 
vessel. ‚Äúe boat is 
relatively long and 
slender, making it 
easier to row,‚Äù 
Morrison says. 
‚ÄúBut if you make it 
too slender, it 
becomes unÔ¨Üa-

traditional

¬öB. Food and Water
A 100-pound tank of salt water supplies the 6 liters of drinking water Spotz needs every day.  
A hose connes the tank‚Äîwhich can be replenished by opening a valve in the footwell‚Äîto a 
desalination machine that can produce 6 gallons of fresh water an hour. But because the 
machine uses a lot of elericity and is prone to failure, Spotz will run it for only 20 minutes 
every other day. She‚Äôll eat 5000 calories of dehydrated food, energy bars and trail mix daily.

¬öC. Mobility
Sails are prohibited 
in ocean rowing, so 
the boat‚Äôs only 
power comes from 
Spotz pulling 
againÔ¨Ü carbon-Ô¨Åber 
oars. Her seat slides 
forward and back on 
tracks in the center 
of the cockpit, which 
increases the oars‚Äô 
angle of attack as 
they enter the 
water‚Äîmaking each 
Ô¨Üroke longer and 
more eÔ¨Écient. 
Spotz faces the 
Ô¨Üern and Ô¨Üraps her 
feet into shoes 
bolted to a board in 
the footwell. Her 
right shoe is 
conneed to a 
cable that runs 
through the rear 
cabin and hooks into 
the tiller, which is 
screwed to the 
rudder, so she can 
Ô¨Üeer as she rows. If 
Ô¨Ürong headwinds 
blow her backward, 
Spotz can attach a 
parachute anchor to 
the Ô¨Üern that 
inÔ¨Çates underwater 
and slows reverse 
travel.

¬öD. Route 
Spotz will launch from Dakar, Senegal, in late December and travel weÔ¨Ü with the 
dominant currents. It will take her 70 to 100 days to row 2500 miles across the Atlantic. 
She‚Äôll aim for Cayenne, French Guiana. But the boat‚Äôs weight relative to Spotz‚Äôs Ô¨Ürength 
will make it diÔ¨Écult to countera wind and northweÔ¨Ü currents that could push her 
toward cliÔ¨Äs or rocks. Currents may also force her to row another 500 miles to George-
town, Guyana. ‚Äúe tougheÔ¨Ü part of the trip will be the arrival,‚Äù Spotz says.
If the boat becomes submerged in high seas, the cabins trap enough air to li the vessel to 
the surface. But without ballaÔ¨Ü weighing down the bottom, the boat would liÔ¨Ü to its side 
and could trap Spotz underwater. ‚ÄúYou have to give the cabin enough volume that the boat is 
unÔ¨Üable when it‚Äôs in that position,‚Äù Morrison says. ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt need a lot of ballaÔ¨Ü, which 
is juÔ¨Ü gratuitous weight.‚Äù So the food, batteries and desalination unit, secured as low as 
possible, become the ballaÔ¨Ü‚Äîand so does Spotz, who will Ô¨Ürap herself to the cabin Ô¨Çoor in 
high seas. e combined weight will Ô¨Çip the boat right side up. A central tank can Ô¨Üore 100 
pounds of seawater, which serves as additional ballaÔ¨Ü, but it‚Äôs not really necessary. ‚Äúis 
boat has enough ballaÔ¨Ü to right itself when the tank is empty,‚Äù Morrison says.
¬öE. Power and Communication
e boat‚Äôs inÔ¨Üruments are powered by 
elericity from two solar panels‚Äîan 
85-watt and a 65-watt‚Äîmounted atop 
the cabins. e panels charge two 12-volt 
batteries, which conne to the VHF radio, 
GPS and navigation lights. An Automatic 
IdentiÔ¨Åcation SyÔ¨Üem sends the coordi-
nates of Spotz‚Äôs boat to surrounding  
ships and warns her when other boats get 
too close. Spotz will bring an iPod for 
music and a laptop to track weather and

James Cameron is a moviemaker with a passion for cutting-edge 
technology and risky projects. Will his movie Avatar be a breakthrough or a                  

The 280,000-square-foot studio in Playa Vista, Calif., has a curious history as a launching pad for big, risky 
ideas. In the 1940s, Howard Hughes used the huge wooden 
airplane hangar to construct the massive plywood H-4 
Hercules seaplane‚Äîfamously known as the Spruce Goose. 
Two years ago, movie director James Cameron was in the 
Playa Vista studio at a crucial stage in his own big, risky 
project. He was viewing early footage from Avatar, the  sci-Ô¨Å 
epic he had been dreaming about since his early 20s. Cam-
eron‚Äôs studio partner, Twentieth Century Fox, had already 
committed to a budget of $200 million (the Ô¨Ånal cost is 
reportedly closer to $300 million) on what promised to be 
the most technologically advanced work of cinema ever 
undertaken. But as Cameron looked into his computer 
monitor, he knew something had gone terribly wrong.
The Ô¨Ålm‚Äîalthough ‚ÄúÔ¨Ålm‚Äù seems to be an anachronis-
tic term for such a digitally intense production‚Äîtakes

Cameron‚Äôs Greatest 
FX Hits
FOR THE MOVIE AVATAR, ACTOR SAM WORTHINGTON WAS TRANSFORMED INTO A 
HUMAN‚ÄìALIEN HYBRID THROUGH PERFORMANCE-CAPTURE TECHNOLOGY.
lush, green world teeming with exotic, 
bioluminescent life to take part in the 
military‚Äôs avatar program. The human 
settlers are interested in mining Pan-
dora‚Äôs resources but can‚Äôt breathe its 
toxic atmosphere, so to help explore the 
moon and meet with the native Na‚Äôvi 
who live there, Sully has his conscious-
ness linked with a genetically engi-
neered 9-foot-tall human‚Äìalien hybrid. 
Cameron wrote his first treatment 
for the movie in 1995 with the intention 
of pushing the boundaries of what was 
possible with cinematic digital effects. 
In his view, making Avatar would 
require blending live-action sequences 
and digitally captured performances in 
a three-dimensional, computer-gener-
ated world. Part action‚Äìadventure, part 
interstellar love story, the project was so 
ambitious that it took 10 more years 
before Cameron felt cinema technology 
had advanced to the point where Avatar 
was even possible. 
The scene on Cameron‚Äôs screen at 
Playa Vista‚Äîan important turning 
point in the movie‚Äôs plot‚Äîshowed Na‚Äôvi 
princess Neytiri, played by Zo√´ Saldana, 
as she Ô¨Årst encounters Sully‚Äôs avatar in 
the jungles of Pandora. Everything in 
the forest is luminous. Glowing sprites 
float through Pandora‚Äôs atmosphere, 
landing on Sully as Neytiri determines if 
he can be trusted. Playing Sully is Sam 
Worthington, an Australian actor whom 
Cameron had plucked from obscurity to 
play the movie‚Äôs hero. Cameron was 
staring directly into Worthington‚Äôs 
face‚Äîor, rather, he was looking into the 
face of a digitally rendered Worthington 
as a creature with blue skin and large 
yellow eyes‚Äîbut he might as well have 
been staring into a Kabuki mask. 
The onscreen rendering of Worthing-
ton was supposed to be a sort of digital 
sleight of hand‚Äîa human character 
inhabiting an alien body so that he could 
blend into an alien world, played by a 
human actor inhabiting a digital body in 
a digital world. To make the whole thing 
work, Worthington‚Äôs performance, those 
subtle expressions that sell a character 
to the audience, had to come through 
the face of his avatar. But after millions 
of dollars of research and development, 
the avatar‚Äôs face was not only lifeless, it 
was downright creepy. It ‚Äúscared the crap 
out of me,‚Äù Cameron recalls. ‚ÄúHorrible! 
It was dead, it was awful, it wasn‚Äôt Sam. 
God, I thought. We‚Äôve done everything 
right and this is what it looks like?‚Äù
The reaction Cameron was feeling 
has a name. It‚Äôs called the uncanny val-
ley, and it‚Äôs a problem for roboticists 
and animators alike. Audiences are 
especially sensitive to renderings of the 
human face, and the closer a digital cre-
ation gets to a photorealistic human, 
the higher expectations get. If you map 
human movements and expression to 
cute furry creatures that dance and sing 
like people, then audiences willingly 
suspend disbelief and go along with it. 
(Think of the penguins in Happy Feet.) 
But if you try to give a digital character a 
humanoid face, anything short of per-
fection can be uncanny‚Äîthus the term. 
Sometimes audience unease is to a char-
acter‚Äôs advantage; in The Lord of the 
Rings the creature Gollum was supposed 
to be unsettling. But Cameron was

looking for empathy, and in the first 
footage, that‚Äôs not what he got.
Why is the computer-generated face 
of a blue, cat-eyed human‚Äìalien hybrid 
so important? Well, for one thing, lots of 
money is riding on it. But so, to an extent, 
is James Cameron‚Äôs stature as an unstop-
pable force in Hollywood. Cameron has 
built up enormous fame and power 
based on his reputation as a technical 
innovator‚Äîpushing the science and 
technology of modelmaking, digital ani-
mation and camera engineering. But 
Cameron is perhaps even more famous 
as the industry‚Äôs biggest risk-taker, 
which might have made him a lot of ene-
mies if his risks hadn‚Äôt been so spectacu-
larly rewarded in the past. In 1997, the 
Ô¨Ålm Titanic taught Hollywood a power-
is a personal mission to him, inextrica-
bly linked with the art. Each new Ô¨Ålm is 
an opportunity to advance the science of 
cinema, and if Avatar succeeds, it will 
change the way movies are captured, 
edited and even acted.
Filmmakers, especially those with  
a technical bent, admire Cameron for 
‚Äúhis willingness to incorporate new tech-
nologies in his Ô¨Ålms without waiting for 
them to be perfected,‚Äù says Bruce Davis, 
the executive director of the Academy of 
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. It adds 
to the risky nature of Cameron‚Äôs proj-
ects, but his storytelling has reaped  
enormous benefits. There‚Äôs a term in 
Hollywood for Cameron‚Äôs style of direct-
ing, Davis says: ‚ÄúThey call this ‚Äòbuilding 
the parachute on the way down.‚Äô‚Äù
ful lesson in Cameronomics: The direc-
tor‚Äôs unquenchable thirst for authentic-
ity and technological perfection required 
deep-sea exploratory Ô¨Ålming, expensive 
scale models and pioneering computer 
graphics that ballooned the film‚Äôs  
budget to $200 million. This upped the 
ante for everyone involved and fright-
ened the heck out of the studio bean 
counters, but the bet paid off‚ÄîTitanic 
went on to make $1.8 billion and win 11 
Academy Awards. 
A unique hybrid of scientist, explorer, 
inventor and artist, Cameron has made 
testing the limits of what is possible part 
of his standard operating procedure. He 
dreams almost impossibly big, and then 
invents ways to bring those dreams into 
reality. The technology of moviemaking

Aer his direorial 
debut (1981‚Äôs Piranha

under pressure to make 
his mark. He and FX whiz 
Stan WinÔ¨Üon designed a 
proÔ¨Ühetic to make it 
appear as though the 
Terminator was taking 
apart his own robotic 
arm‚Äîwhile allowing 
aor Arnold 
Schwarzenegger to 
wiggle his Ô¨Ångers. ese

The Abyss  
EFFECT: Water tentacle 
Innovations in e Abyss 
included illuminated 
water helmets and 
self-propelled camera 
platforms. But 
Cameron‚Äôs biggeÔ¨Ü 
advance was in 
computer graphics. A 
digitally rendered water 
tentacle was cinema‚Äôs

Cameron resurreed the

in e Abyss to turn 
aor Robert Patrick into 
the liquid-metal T-1000. 
is was the Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü time

decks. A few aors‚Äô 
movements were 
captured, then Cameron 
replicated them. Direor

Directing a Virtual World

On-Set Playback
To shoot a scene within a 
totally CG world, 
Cameron had virtual 
produion supervisor 
Glenn Derry rig up 
augmented-reality 
cameras. Cameron could 
watch from the sidelines 
as his aors‚Äô perfor-
mances were inÔ¨Üantly 
mapped to their CG 
charaers and displayed 
via an on-set screen. Or 
he could use a portable, 
motion-tracking virtual 
camera to walk through 
the volume and view the 
CG environment of the 
movie on its LCD screen. 
Like many aors in 
Avatar, Zo√´ Saldana  
plays a fully computer-
 generated charaer , Na‚Äôvi 
princess Neytiri. To map 
her movements to her 
digital doppelg√§nger, 
Saldana wore a 
motion-capture bodysuit 
with reference markers 
and Ô¨Üripes. She also 
wore a head rig designed 
by Cameron that aimed  
a small video camera at 
her face. at camera 
tracked green ink dots, 
painted on Saldana‚Äôs 
face, throughout the 
scene, giving Cameron 
closeup-level detail of 
changes in expression to 
map to Neytiri‚Äôs CG face. 
The Volume
MoÔ¨Ü of James Cameron‚Äôs space epic, Avatar, was shot on a performance-capture Ô¨Üage, known as 
the volume, in Playa ViÔ¨Üa, Calif. e volume was rimmed by 120 Ô¨Üationary video cameras, which 
could record the movements of all aors at once in 3D, with submillimeter precision. Data from the 
cameras was Ô¨Üreamed into Autodesk soware, which translates aors‚Äô movements into digital 
charaers in real time within a low-resolution computer-generated environment. So riding a fake 
banshee mockup onÔ¨Üage inÔ¨Üantly translated to CG footage. Multiple cameramen were used on set 
for reference video, but because the volume essentially captures performances from every angle at 
once, Cameron could digitally render whatever angles and shots he wanted aer the performance, 
adjuÔ¨Üing the camera movements while viewing playback.

To transition from the

Cameron sent his rough

Final Render
and burned by 9 am? That was my start. 
It wasn‚Äôt as a creative Ô¨Ålmmaker‚Äîit was 
as a tech dude.‚Äù
Over the years, Cameron‚Äôs budgets 
have increased to become the biggest in 
the business, and digital technology has 
changed the realm of the possible in 
Hollywood, but Cameron is still very 
much the gonzo engineer. He helped 
found the special-effects company Digi-
tal Domain in the early 1990s, and he 
surrounds himself with Hollywood 
inventors such as Vince Pace, who 
developed special underwater lighting 
for Cameron‚Äôs 1989 undersea sci-fi 
thriller, The Abyss. Pace also worked 
with Cameron on Ghosts of the Abyss, a 
2003 undersea 3D documentary that 
explored the wreck of the Titanic. For 
that movie, Pace and Cameron designed 
a unique hi-def 3D camera system that 
fused two Sony HDC-F950 HD cameras 
2¬Ω inches apart to mimic the stereo-
scopic separation of human eyes. The 
Fusion Camera System has since been 
used for 3D movies such as Journey to 
the Center of the Earth and the upcom-
ing Tron Legacy, and at sporting events 
such as the 2007 NBA Ô¨Ånals. 
The 3D experience is at the heart of 
Avatar. (In fact, some suspect that Cam-
eron cannily delayed the movie‚Äôs release 
to wait for more theaters to install 3D 
screens‚Äîthere will be more than 3000 
for the launch.) Stereoscopic movie-
making has historically been the nov-
elty act of cinema. But Cameron sees  
3D as a subtler experience. To Ô¨Ålm the 
live-action sequences of Avatar, he 
used a modiÔ¨Åed version of the Fusion 
camera. The new 3D camera creates an 
augmented-reality view for Cameron as 
he shoots, sensing its position on a 
motion-capture stage, then integrating 
the live actors into CG environments on 
the viewfinder. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a unique way of 
shooting stereo movies,‚Äù says visual-
effects supervisor Stephen Rosenbaum. 
‚ÄúCameron uses it to look into the envi-
ronment; it‚Äôs not about beating people 
over the head with visual spectacle.‚Äù 
This immersive 3D brings a heightened 
believability to Avatar‚Äôs live-action 
sequences‚Äîgradually bringing viewers 
But repeatedly pulling off these feats 
of derring-do requires both the drive of 
an ambitious egomaniac and an engi-
neer‚Äôs plodding patience. ‚ÄúYou have to 
eat pressure for breakfast if you are 
going to do this job,‚Äù Cameron says. 
‚ÄúOn the one hand, pressure is a good 
thing. It makes you think about what 
you‚Äôre doing, your audience. You‚Äôre not 
making a personal statement, like a 
novel. But you can‚Äôt make a movie for 
everybody‚Äîthat‚Äôs the kiss of death. You 
have to make it for yourself.‚Äù
=edpe;\\[Yji
Cameron‚Äôs dual-sided personality 
has roots in his upbringing‚Äîthe brainy 
sci-Ô¨Å geek from Chippewa, Ontario, was 
raised by a painter mother and an engi-
neer father. ‚ÄúIt was always a parallel 
push between art and technology,‚Äù he 
says. ‚ÄúMy approach to Ô¨Ålmmaking was 
always very technical. I started off imag-
ining not that I would be a director, but 
a special-effects practitioner.‚Äù 
Unable to afford to go to Ô¨Ålm school 
in Los Angeles, Cameron supported 
himself as a truck driver and studied 
visual effects on weekends at the Univer-
sity of Southern California library, 
photo copying dissertations on optical 
printing and the sensitometry of film 
stocks. ‚ÄúThis is not bull,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI gave 
myself a great course on Ô¨Ålm FX for the 
cost of the copying.‚Äù
Cameron eventually landed  
a job on the effects crew of 
Roger Corman‚Äôs low-budget 
1980 film Battle Beyond  
the Stars, but he didn‚Äôt 
tell anyone that he was 
an autodidact with no 
practical experience. 
When he was exposed 
to the reality of film 
production, it was very 
different from what  
he had imagined, he 
recalls: ‚ÄúIt was totally 
gonzo problem solving.

deeper into the exotic world of Pan-
dora. In an early scene, Sully looks out 
the window as he Ô¨Çies over the giant 
trees and waterfalls of the jungle

3D perspective gives the planet mass 
and scale, making it as dizzyingly real 
for viewers as it is for him.

Yet live-action 3D was hardly the 
biggest technical challenge. Only about 
25 percent of the movie was created 
using traditional live performances on 
sets. The rest takes place in an entirely 
computer-generated world‚Äîcombin-
ing performance capture with virtual 
environments that have never before 
been realized on film. Conjuring up 
this exotic world allowed Cameron to 
engage in ‚Äúbig-time design,‚Äù he says, 
with six-legged hammerhead thana-
tors, armored direhorses, pterodactyl-
like banshees, hundreds of trees and 
plants, Ô¨Çoating mountains and incred-
ible landscapes, all created from 
scratch. He drew upon his experience 
with deep-sea biology and plant life for 
inspiration. Sigourney Weaver, who 
plays botanist Grace Augustine, calls it 
‚Äúthe most ambitious movie I‚Äôve ever 
been in. Every single plant and creature 
has come out of this crazy person‚Äôs 
head. This is what Cameron‚Äôs inner 
14-year-old wanted to see.‚Äù 
To bring his actors into this world, 
Cameron collaborated with Weta Digi-
tal, an effects house founded by The 
Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson. 
Weta has created some of the most 
groundbreaking characters in recent 
years, using human performances to 
animate digital creatures such as Gol-
lum in the Rings series and the great 
ape in Jackson‚Äôs 2005 version of King 
Kong. By now, the process of basic 
motion capture is well-established. 
Actors are dressed in ‚Äúmocap‚Äù suits 
studded with reÔ¨Çective reference mark-
ers and stripes, then cameras capture 
the basic movements of a performance, 
which are later mapped to digital char-
acters in a computer. 
For actors, the process of perform-
ing within an imaginary world, 
squeezed into a leotard while pretend-
ing to inhabit an alien body, is a chal-
lenge. Motion-capture technology is 
capable of recording a 360-degree view 
of performances, so actors must play 
scenes with no idea where the ‚Äúcam-
era‚Äù will eventually be. Weaver found 
the experience liberating. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs sim-
pler,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúYou just act. There‚Äôs 
no hair or makeup, nothing. It‚Äôs just 
you and the material. You forget every-
thing but the story you‚Äôre telling.‚Äù 
Directing within a virtual set is more 
difÔ¨Åcult. Most directors choose their 
angles and shots on a computer screen 
in postproduction. But by then, most 
of the immediacy of the performance is 
lost. Cameron wanted to be able to see 
his actors moving within the virtual 
environments while still on the motion-
capture stage (called the volume). So 
he challenged his virtual-production 
supervisor Glenn Derry to come up 
with a virtual camera that could show 
him a low-resolution view of Pandora 
as he shot the performances. 
The resulting swing camera (so 
called because its screen could swing 
to any angle to give Cameron greater 
freedom of movement) is another of 
Avatar‚Äôs breakthrough technologies. 
The swing camera has no lens at all, 
only an LCD screen and markers that 
record its position and orientation 
within the volume relative to the 
actors. That position information is 
then run through an effects switcher, 
which feeds back low- resolution CG 
versions of both the actors and the 
environment of Pandora to the swing 
cam‚Äôs screen in real time. 
This virtual camera allowed Cam-
eron to shoot a scene simply by moving 
through the volume. Cameron could 
pick up the camera and shoot his actors 
photographically, as the performance

ACTION SEQUENCES IN THE MOVIE AVATAR.


occurred, or he could reshoot any 
scene by walking through the empty 
soundstage with the device after the 
actors were gone, capturing dif ferent 
camera angles as the scene replayed.
But all of this technology can lead 
right back into the uncanny valley, 
because capturing an actor‚Äôs move-
ments is only a small step toward  
creating a believable digital character. 
Without the subtle expressions of the 
face, Cameron might as well be playing 
with marionettes. Getting this crucial 
element right required him to push 
Weta‚Äôs technology far beyond anything 
the company had done before. 
In fact, Cameron doesn‚Äôt even like 
the term ‚Äúmotion capture‚Äù for the 
proc ess used on Avatar. He prefers to 
call it ‚Äúperformance capture.‚Äù This 
may seem like semantics, but to Cam-
eron, the subtle facial expressions that 
define an actor‚Äôs performance had 
been lost for many of the digital char-
acters that have come before. In those 
Ô¨Ålms, the process of motion capture 
served only as a starting point for  
animators, who would finish the job 
with digital brush strokes. ‚ÄúGollum‚Äôs 
face was entirely animated by hand,‚Äù 
says Weta Digital effects master Joe 
Letteri. ‚ÄúKing Kong was a third or so 
straight performance capture. It was 
never automatic.‚Äù This time, Cameron 
wanted to keep the embellishment by 
animators to a minimum and let the 
actors drive their own performances.  
In order to pull more data from the 
actors‚Äô faces, Cameron reworked an 
old idea he had sketched on a napkin 
back in 1995: fasten a tiny camera to 
the front of a helmet to track every 
facial movement, from darting eyes 
and twitching noses to furrowing  
eyebrows and the tricky interaction of 
jaw, lips, teeth and tongue. ‚ÄúI knew I 
could not fail if I had a 100 percent 
closeup of the actor 100 percent of the 
time that traveled with them wherever 
they went,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThat really makes 
a closeup come alive.‚Äù
The information from the cameras 
produced a digital framework, or rig, of 
an actor‚Äôs face. The rig was then given a 
set of rules that applied the muscle 
movements of each actor‚Äôs face to that 
of the avatar or the Na‚Äôvi that he or she 
was playing. To make a CG character 
express the same emotion as a human 
actor, the rig had to translate every arch 
of a human eyebrow directly to the digi-
tal character‚Äôs face. 
But it turns out there is no magic 
formula that can supplant hard work 
and lots of trial and error. After Cam-
eron complained about the uncanny-
valley effect, Weta spent another year 
perfecting the rig on Worthington‚Äôs 
avatar by tweaking the algorithms that 
guided its movements and expressions 
until he came alive enough to meet 
Cameron‚Äôs sky-high standards. ‚ÄúIt was 
torturous,‚Äù Letteri admits. But when 
Weta was Ô¨Ånished, you could pour the 
motion-capture data into the rig and it 
would come out the other side right.
With all the attention focused on 
Avatar, anything short of perfection 
may not be good enough. Cameron is 
asking moviegoers to believe in a deep 
new universe of his own design and to 
buy the concept that 9-foot-tall blue 
aliens can communicate human emo-
tions. If Cameron is wrong, then Avatar 
may be remembered as the moment 
when the battle for the uncanny valley 
was lost. If he is right, the technology 
will disappear behind the story line, 
and audiences will lose themselves in 
Avatar‚Äôs world.

tereoscopic movies make more money per theater than their 2D counterparts, but according 
to the 3D@Home Consortium, Hollywood Ô¨Üudios generate as much as 50 percent of 
revenue from DVD sales. So the next big push for Ô¨Üereoscopic content is the home theater. But 
is it worth the upgrade? Here‚Äôs what you need to know.  BY ERIN MCCARTHY

What about content?
Right now, PC games are the only widely 
available Ô¨Üereoscopic content, but  
3D@Home‚Äôs Chris Chinnock expes 
approximately 35 movies to be released on 
the upcoming Blu-ray 3D format within the 
next year, and approximately 130 titles in the 
next two years ‚Äîpricing for the new discs is 
Ô¨Üill unknown. Stereoscopic video 
games for PS3 (le), Xbox and Wii 
are also coming this year, and 
3D movies will eventually be 
downloadable to PCs and 
TVs via services such as 
Roxio CinemaNow.
What equipment will I 
need to play 3D?
Some TVs, such as DLP rear-projeion sets, 
can already play 3D content, but current 
LCDs and plasmas can‚Äôt, so moÔ¨Ü people will 
have to spring for a new set‚ÄîPanasonic has 
announced Ô¨Üereoscopic plasmas for 2010. 
New 3D Blu-ray players are also coming this 
year, but some current machines, 
such as the PlayStation 3, will 
need only a simple Ô¨Årmware 
upgrade. Also required: 
shutter glasses, such as 
the Nvidia 3D Vision Kit 
($199; above).

LAST YEAR, 54 PEOPLE IN NORTH AMERICA LOST THEIR LIVES TO 
AVALANCHES. THREE OF THOSE DEATHS OCCURRED AT SKI AREAS. 
THAT‚ÄôS NOT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN‚ÄîEVER. BUT THERE‚ÄôS ONE THING 
YOU LEARN ON DAWN PATROL AT PLACES LIKE BIG SKY, MONTANA:  
IN THE MOUNTAINS, YOU‚ÄôRE NEVER COMPLETELY SAFE.
The bomb is the size of a soup can, bright orange, stuffed with two pounds of pentolite‚Äîa 
chalky mixture of TNT and an even more powerful explosive compound known as PETN. 
Ross Titilah, a 31-year-old ski patroller at Big Sky Resort in southern Montana, ties the bomb 
to one end of a short nylon rope and triggers the igniter. Ninety seconds until detonation. 
The other end of the rope is attached to what‚Äôs known as a bomb tram‚Äîa sort of ski lift for 
explosives that stretches from one Ô¨Ån of rock to another high above the entrance to a steep 
gully in Big Sky‚Äôs experts-only area.
The tram is cranked by hand, using a pulley system assembled from parts of an old chair-
lift, and Ross hurriedly rotates the wheel until the bomb is dangling over the center of the 
gully, several feet above the snow‚Äîgiving the shock waves more room to do their work. Ross 
crouches down, amid swirling snow, and shouts into his radio: ‚ÄúFire in the hole!‚Äù
It‚Äôs a little after sunrise on March 5, 2009, after a night of intense snowfall, nearing the 
end of what will prove to be one of the most frightening avalanche seasons in memory, with a 
total of 54 fatalities in the United States and Canada. That‚Äôs an average of more than three 
deaths a week during the height of the season, and the second highest tally since record-
keeping began in 1950. But it‚Äôs not the number of fatalities that made the season so nerve-

shown here, by using explosive charges to pre-emptively trigger slides. 

wracking for patrollers; it‚Äôs where they took place. Usu-
ally, avalanche deaths happen in the backcountry, 
away from an established ski area. Even a single in-
bounds fatal avalanche is considered unusual. 
Last winter, there were three. A 27-year-old woman 
was buried in a slide at Snowbird, Utah; a 21-year-old 
man was killed at Squaw Valley, Calif.; and a 31-year-
old man was swept away in Jackson Hole, Wyo. All the 
incidents took place on steep, difÔ¨Åcult terrain, much 
like the gullies where Ross and his patrol partner, Steve 
Emerson, are working now. The Jackson death was 
especially troubling, since the skier was wearing both a 
helmet and an avalanche transceiver‚Äîa homing 
device, worn around the torso, that greatly aids in a 
speedy rescue‚Äîand was found by other skiers within 8 
minutes. It was still too late. One avalanche forecaster 
in British Columbia said that North America hadn‚Äôt 
seen such unstable conditions in at least 100 years.
Less than 48 hours before my visit, another tragedy 
took place. A veteran patroller at Squaw Valley, 
attempting to make a slope safe for the public, was killed in a 
slide. Patrollers are a tight bunch‚Äîfewer than 5000 pros work 
in the United States, and they frequently visit other areas to 
swap knowledge and techniques. A fatality impacts the whole 
community, which is why the Big Sky patrol locker room, nor-
mally chatty and caffeinated even in the pre-dawn dark, felt 
somber and a touch nervous when I arrived.
Big Sky is one of the more awe-inspiring resorts in North 
America, centered around a solitary pyramidal mountain‚Äî
Lone Peak‚Äîwhich can be skied right from the summit. I 
arrived following one of the winter‚Äôs biggest storms, which 
dropped more than a foot of snow amid Ô¨Åerce winds. The easi-
est thing to do, when faced with an unstable snowpack, is sim-
ply keep most of the mountain closed. Sometimes this hap-
pens. But a patroller‚Äôs job is a tricky juggle between mitigating 
natural dangers and satiating skiers‚Äô desires. To an avid skier 
or snowboarder, there‚Äôs nothing more joyful than flying 
through steep, untracked snow‚Äîprecisely the scenario that‚Äôs 
most uncertain in terms of stability. The compromise is that, 
after a storm, the patrol activates the most slide-prone areas 
by detonating powerful explosives.
High on the Ô¨Çanks of Lone Peak, in the moments before 
the bomb hanging from the tram is set to explode, Ross and 
Steve instinctively scan the surrounding slopes, reading the 
terrain with practiced eyes. ‚ÄúFlagged there,‚Äù says Ross, indi-
cating a line of evergreens whose branches have been sheared 
off on one side where previous avalanches have swept close 
by. ‚ÄúPoint release,‚Äù Steve says, motioning with his chin to a 
spot where a cliff band, warmed by the rising sun, is naturally 
shedding the new powder, sloughing little waterfalls of snow. 
There‚Äôs a Ô¨Çash, and a bang‚Äîand, for a second, nothing. 
Then, from down in the gully comes a loud and disconcerting 
whooomp, as if an overloaded bookshelf has snapped its sup-
ports and dropped onto the shelf below it, which is close to 
what has happened. Abruptly, what had looked like an invit-
ing ski run is transformed into a tumbling, churning mass of 
snow, blasting down the hill‚Äîavalanches often exceed 90 
miles per hour‚Äîleaving in its wake a billowing cloud of snow 
mist, gorgeous and daunting at once. 
This is a relatively small slide. The vertical crown face at the 
top of the avalanche path‚Äîwhich indicates the depth of the 
snow slab that broke away‚Äîis only a foot tall. Some slides at 
Big Sky have 13-foot crowns. Still, it‚Äôs easy to see how, if a skier 
is caught in an avalanche, escape is virtually impossible. Once 
the slide is over, though, the slope is considerably safer; it‚Äôs 
like a rubber band that has snapped, its tension dissipated.
situations imaginable is 
to be buried in an avalanche. I know this from Ô¨Årsthand, albeit 
highly controlled, experience. Several seasons ago, I volun-
teered to help with the training of Big Sky‚Äôs avalanche-rescue 
dogs, which must learn how to sniff out victims trapped 
beneath the snow. I crawled into a 6-foot-deep hole and created 
a breathing space by cupping my hands in front of my face as

patrollers shoveled snow over me. I am not typically a claustro-
phobic person, and I knew this was a carefully monitored exer-
cise. That said, the 10 minutes that elapsed before the dog 
found me rank as some of the most frightening of my life. The 
snow, even just a few feet under, is pitch-dark. It‚Äôs extraordi-
narily heavy. I couldn‚Äôt move. My breathing, clipped and pan-
icky, was ampliÔ¨Åed in my ears. I‚Äôve never felt happier to have a 
dog lick me across my face.
No matter how experienced a ski patroller is, the danger of 
a particular slope can never be evaluated perfectly. All three 
in-bounds deaths last winter came on runs that patrollers had 
deemed safe. All had been bombed, and one had slid. 
Avalanche danger is present when two layers of snow, on a 
moderately steep slope, do not adequately adhere to each 
other. Every snowstorm has a unique signature. Different 
Ô¨Çakes‚Äîneedles, prisms, dendrites, columns, plates‚Äîfall at 
different temperatures, in varying levels of humidity, and are 
then baked by Ô¨Çuctuating degrees of solar radiation. When a 
patroller digs a pit to examine the snowpack, the layer left by 
each snowstorm can be seen distinctly, like the striations in 
the walls of the Grand Canyon.
If two adjoining layers are poorly bonded, there‚Äôs a fault 
line in the snow‚Äîone that, it‚Äôs hoped, is dislodged by the 
force of a bomb. But a ski slope can be akin to a mineÔ¨Åeld. 
Throw a charge in one spot, and nothing may happen. Put the 
weight of a skier on another spot just minutes later, and the 
upper layer can collapse onto the lower and begin to slide‚Äî
slabs of snow moving downhill like a load of mattresses slid-
ing off a dump truck, escalating in speed and power.
Big Sky has lost two patrollers, one in 1982, in an ava-
lanche, and another on Christmas morning, 1996, when a

Las Vegas casinos are incubators of the 
world‚Äôs most advanced surveillance tech. 
And the spy gear that helps Sin City has 
taught everyone from government to big 
banks how to snoop more effectively.
In the surveillance equipment room at

video encoders process feeds from more

IT IS 2 AM INSIDE THE BUNKER-LIKE SURVEILLANCE
room at the Mirage Resort in Las Vegas, but 28 wall monitors 
show there‚Äôs still plenty of action down on the Ô¨Çoor. A surveil-
lance worker we‚Äôll call Tom logs in and starts the graveyard shift, 
taking an overhead tour of the 100,000-square-foot casino. Using 
a joystick, keypad and three desktop screens, he surveys video 
from some of the 1000 ceiling cameras. 
Tom is a table-games specialist, so he starts by scrutinizing 
a few poker hands, then sweeps over medium-stakes blackjack 
and watches a busy craps table. Nothing looks un usual until he 
stops at a baccarat game in the high-limit room, where betting 
minimums start at $100 per hand. He focuses on a young Asian 
man in a white suit who keeps his hands curiously positioned. 
Sometimes they cover the cards in front of him; at other times 
they rest on the side of the table. Suddenly, the man sweeps one 
hand up along a lapel of his jacket.

with fresh applications for the technology.‚Äù
Vegas‚Äôs gaming industry, after all, has the  resources and 
incentives to be a pioneer in surveillance tech and data mining. 
‚ÄúCasinos employ the most talented cryptographers, computer 
security experts and game theorists,‚Äù says John Pironti, chief 
information risk strategist for Archer Technologies, a Kansas-
based company that specializes in data protection. ‚ÄúCasinos 
are vulnerable and have a vested interest in being innovative.‚Äù 
A modern Vegas property is a microcosm of a wider world, 
with restaurants, a hotel, entertainment venues, retail shops 
and a sophisticated system of currency exchange. It‚Äôs all in a 
highly controlled environment where customers eagerly volun-
teer personal data for a chance at comps. As a result, casinos 
maintain a treasure trove of information on customer behavior 
that most marketers would die for. Players cards and gambling 
in general are opt-in propositions. The casino industry is  highly 
regulated, and the watchful tech is not only legal but, in many 
cases, mandated. Still, the opaqueness of the programs is a 
cause of concern for some privacy advocates. ‚ÄúWhy should casi-
nos have secret files on their best customers?‚Äù asks Marc 
Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Infor-
mation Center (EPIC). ‚ÄúPeople should know the information 
that casinos gather on them.‚Äù 
Digital data has a long memory, and effective surveillance 
technology spreads fast. The software that measures your gam-
bling skill at the blackjack table today could be gathering data 
Like many gamblers in Las Vegas, the man presented a play-
ers card, the equivalent of a customer-loyalty card, to the dealer 
before buying into the game. Through these cards, the casino 
monitors the play of guests and dispenses complimentary 
goodies accordingly (risk enough money, and you may wind up 
in a villa with a butler). The card enables Tom to retrieve a pro-
Ô¨Åle of the player: his name, date of birth, address, amounts 
won and lost on previous visits and other data. 
Tom checks the player‚Äôs long-term success rate at baccarat: 
He‚Äôs a stone-cold loser. Common sense suggests that his poor 
record should exonerate him. Playing a hunch, Tom uses an 
internal search engine to correlate every player and dealer that 
the suspect has gambled with at the Mirage. One name 
repeats‚Äîa big winner, also Asian. On this trip alone, he‚Äôs 
ahead hundreds of thousands of dollars, and he happens to be 
playing right now, at the same table as Mr. White Suit. 
Less than an hour later, Tom makes the call. He is con-
vinced that the fellow in the white suit is not rubbing his lapel 
but dipping his Ô¨Ånger inside his jacket. He is swapping cards in 
and out of the game, a tactic known as hand mucking. Capital-
izing on baccarat‚Äôs simple rules, which allow gamblers to take 
the side of player or banker, Mr. White Suit loses minimal 
wagers while his confederate wins large ones from the casino.
When the winning conspirator attempts to cash out his 
chips, guards detain him. Other guards hustle the mucker from 
the table. The cheater tries to break free, then drops to his 
knees and eats the card that he had slipped inside his jacket. 
He may have swallowed the evidence, but the casino‚Äôs digital 
ceiling cameras have captured all of his illicit actions.
Soon after this incident, the Mirage outÔ¨Åtted its baccarat 
tables with a system known as Angel Eye. A scanner hidden in 
the shoe‚Äîthe plastic case out of which cards are dealt for 
multi deck games‚Äîreads invisible bar-code strips on the cards. 
‚ÄúAngel Eye identiÔ¨Åes the cards as they come out and conveys 
that information to the dealer,‚Äù director of surveillance Ted 
Whiting says. If a player swaps in a card, the dealer knows. 
‚ÄúThat one change put card muckers out of business here.‚Äù
ENTER A MAJOR LAS VEGAS CASINO, AND YOU MIGHT 
as well be walking into a complex computer built to study your 
relationship with money, your motivation for gambling, even 
your taste in food. Cameras capture your every move, software 
calibrates your play, and regressive-analytic applications (like 
those used on Wall Street to predict a stock‚Äôs future) estimate 
your long-term worth to the casino. 
Given the wild bets taken recently by investment banks, the 
overlap of gambling and Ô¨Ånancial technology may not be sur-
prising. But the innovations pioneered for Las Vegas surveil-
lance rooms have signiÔ¨Åcance and applications that reach a lot 
farther than a trading Ô¨Çoor. According to Dave Shepherd, for-
mer executive director of security at the Venetian Resort Hotel 
Casino, Las Vegas is an ideal proving ground for innovations 
that eventually end up in airports, shopping malls and govern-
ment agencies. ‚ÄúThere is no Underwriters Laboratory for secu-
rity technology,‚Äù says Shepherd, who serves on a casino-focused 
council afÔ¨Åliated with Homeland Security. ‚ÄúCasinos use the 
earliest versions of security and surveillance devices. People in 
other industries see how they work, and those people come up 
ree types of cameras feed the video wall in the

the Ô¨Çoor, and 360-degree cams take in an entire area.

Paying close attention to customers is as much a security 
concern as it is a marketing opportunity for casinos. From the 
moment you place your Ô¨Årst bet with your players card, the 
casino starts paying attention . ‚ÄúThat financial transaction 
feeds into a data-warehousing platform,‚Äù says David Norton, 
chief marketing ofÔ¨Åcer of Harrah‚Äôs Entertainment. The most 
direct interface with the system is a modern slot machine. 
These days most slots are run by computers, and until recently, 
all of these computers have been self-contained machines. To 
make adjustments on standard slots, attendants have to stop 
play, open the housing and swap out chips, a time-consuming 
process that reduces proÔ¨Åts for the casino. The Mirage‚Äôs soon-
to-open sister property, Aria Resort & Casino, however, will be 
the Ô¨Årst casino in Las Vegas outÔ¨Åtted with server-based slot 
machines. That means Aria‚Äôs one-armed bandits will run off a 
single computer, allowing supervisors to alter machines sim-
ply by pushing backroom buttons that can change games, odds 
and limits to suit the player or the situation. If a player is in 
town for the National Finals Rodeo, the slot machine could 
load up a game with a rodeo theme, and alert the player when 
certain comps kick in or provide the showtimes of events he 
Many casinos know who you are before  
you even walk through the door. At the 
self- and valet-parking areas of the Mirage, for 
example, cameras scan the license plates of 
vehicles as they enter. Piures of every plate 
are then run through optical charaer-

RFID Chips

Cashier‚Äôs Window
Money talks in Vegas, but your chips speak in 
code. Some casinos, such as Wynn Las 
Vegas, have high-frequency radio transceivers 
hidden in the chips. e technology can be 
used to conÔ¨Årm that the chips are legit and 
can also be used for real-time accounting, so 
that management knows where the money is 
at all times.
s "EYOND 6EGAS Tiny, cheap RFIDs are so pervasive that 
millions of people carry at leaÔ¨Ü one of these 
trackable transceivers on themselves at all 
times, in the form of a corporate ID, 
contaless credit card or toll-colleion pass.
Server-based computerized slot machines 
allow casino management to change games 
and set odds remotely, then push games out 
to each machine from a centralized location. 
When used with a loyalty card, the game can 
track betting patterns and deliver a 
cuÔ¨Üomized game to the player. 
s "EYOND 6EGAS Slot machines all operate using a complex 
algorithm known as a random-number 
generator. And the same type of program 
that determines jackpots is also useful for 
high-tech cryptography, which protes 
government secrets via encryption.
e cashier‚Äôs window is the laÔ¨Ü line of 
defense againÔ¨Ü those who try to take 
advantage of the house. Automated 
document scanners can determine if an ID  
is valid before a cashier dispenses a credit 
card advance for chips. If things don‚Äôt match 
up, an automatic call goes to security before 
the perp or cashier even realizes there‚Äôs  
an issue. 
s "EYOND 6EGAS Real-time document veriÔ¨Åcation scanners 
are used to inÔ¨Üantly check the authenticity 
of IDs at border crossings, banks and 
nightclub doors.

All the personal attention may seem Ô¨Çattering so long as the 
casino values your business. But what about those people who 
are viewed as undesirable? At the Venetian Resort Hotel 
Casino, special software allows security workers to enter a sus-
pected bad guy‚Äôs characteristics (a mustache, say, along with a 
forearm tattoo and a habit of lurking around roulette tables). If 
there is a visual match from the  casino‚Äôs database, it pops up 
on the screen, along with identiÔ¨Åcation data. ‚ÄúWe have a lot of 
coverage, a lot of cameras, a lot of information,‚Äù says Dan Eit-
nier, head of surveillance at the Venetian. ‚ÄúA couple of years 
ago we had a collusion situation, and by Ô¨Ånding the suspected 
dealer‚Äôs car-loan application in our Ô¨Åle on him‚Äù‚Äîthe lender 
had asked the Venetian to conÔ¨Årm his employment there‚Äî‚ÄúI 
saw that he gave one of his frequent players as a reference.‚Äù 
The scheme unraveled from there, and both men were busted. 
New algorithms have elevated this type of on-the-spot back-
ground check to a Vegas art form. Non- obvious relationship 
awareness (NORA) software allows casinos to determine 
 quickly if a potentially colluding player and dealer have ever 
shared a phone number or a room at the casino hotel, or lived 
at the same address. ‚ÄúWe created the software for the gaming 

78  J A N U A R Y  2 0 1 0   |   P O P U L A R M E C H A N I C S . C O M
industry,‚Äù says Jeff Jonas, founder of 
Systems Research & Development, 
which originally designed NORA. The 
technology proved so effective that 
Homeland Security adapted it to sniff 
out connections between suspected 
terrorists. ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs used as business 
intelligence for banks, insurance com-
panies and retailers,‚Äù Jonas says.
According to EPIC‚Äôs Rotenberg, any 
industry that collects so much data  
on its customers is at risk for a com-
puter security breach. ‚ÄúEven if casinos 
have no interest in using their informa-
tion for any purpose other than the 
intended one, things don‚Äôt always go as 
planned.‚Äù Especially, he points out, 
since security teams at competing casi-
nos often share information.
With all the data collection and 
camera monitoring going on in casi-
nos, a sense of gambler‚Äôs paranoia is 
understandable. But it‚Äôs worth remem-
bering that the same technology that 
protects the house could end up pro-
tecting you. Casinos are tempting 
 places for pickpockets; customers stroll 
the Ô¨Çoors with cocktails in their hands 
and thousands of dollars in their  
pockets. Some of the sexiest-sounding  
software‚Äîfacial-recognition systems that promise to set off 
alarms as soon as a known criminal enters the property‚Äîis 
still too primitive to be useful. However, more reliable analytic 
software is employed in casinos such as the Mirage to monitor 
video feeds for suspicious activity‚Äîsomeone hiding in a stair-
well, for example, or a purse left unattended too long. 
THE MOST ADVANCED SURVEILLANCE TOOL IN THE 
gaming industry is focused on the blackjack tables at Barona 
Resort & Casino in Southern California, where management 
aggressively tests new technology. The system, called Table-
Eye21, was created by Canadian computer engineer Prem 
Gururajan to proÔ¨Åle and rate players according to skill. 
TableEye21 uses overhead video cameras and video analy-
sis software, and can track information from casino chips 
embedded with radio frequency (RFID) transmitters. The sys-
tem quickly identiÔ¨Åes ‚Äúadvantage‚Äù players who can cost casi-
nos proÔ¨Åts. These gamblers use legal strategies such as card 
counting and shufÔ¨Çe tracking, in which the  player watches for 
clumps of favorable cards. Gururajan says TableEye21 will be 
coming online soon at a Vegas casino, and surveillance spe-
cialists are enthusiastic about the product. ‚ÄúYou get a printout 
of the player‚Äôs skill level, how much you can expect to win from 
him and whether the dealer is making errors,‚Äù Gururajan says. 
‚ÄúSince the system tracks the player‚Äôs bets, the casino knows 
exactly how good a customer the player is.‚Äù 
Sometimes, casino monitoring can go too far. A few years 
ago a product called MindPlay hit the market. Fourteen tiny 
cameras photographed cards as they came out of the black-
jack shoe. The system‚Äôs software executed a quick bit of analy-
sis and notiÔ¨Åed dealers, in real time, whether shoes were cold 
or hot‚Äîthat is, when the remaining cards favored players. 
‚ÄúThat would be a good time for the casino to come up with an 
excuse to shufÔ¨Çe,‚Äù says veteran security director Arnie Roth-
stein. ‚ÄúPlayers found out about it and complained to the 
Gaming Control Board.‚Äù The product, according to its manu-
facturer, is no longer in use.
Inside his plushly carpeted surveillance lair at the rococo 
Venetian, Dan Eitnier inspects the Ô¨Çat-screen monitors on 
the walls. He acknowledges that technology runs both ways 
in the gaming business: The operators aren‚Äôt the only ones 
who capitalize on cheaper bytes and easy access to data. 
Eitnier admits that all casino games are vulnerable. 
Enhancements in technology have simply added another  layer 
to the endless cat-and-mouse game played by those who  
are paid to protect casinos and the renegades who get rich by 
out-thinking the protectors. ‚ÄúWhenever new technology is 
introduced, you always have people out there who want to beat  
it,‚Äù he says. Cheaters buy and dissect slot machines, angle- 
shooters analyze automatic shufÔ¨Çers in search of patterns, 
and card counters continue to stymie facial recognition. ‚ÄúThey 
Ô¨Ånd weaknesses in the technology, and then we come up with 
new technology that they have not yet Ô¨Ågured out.‚Äù 
Eitnier leans back in his chair and keeps his eyes on the 
monitors. He smiles. ‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúwithout those 
people trying to beat everything, I wouldn‚Äôt have a job.‚Äù

A romp on an empty back road with the right car can deliver a double shot of 
high-performance fun. When the chemistry is just right, the driver melds into 
one harmonious bond with the hardware. Yet the cognitive man‚Äìmachine mashup 
isn‚Äôt the exclusive domain of the six-Ô¨Ågure sports car. There are plenty of inexpensive 
rides that deliver a hardcore mission‚Äîwith little Ô¨Çuff. 
We gathered six of the newest cheap speed machines and divided them into three 
groups based on driveline. In the rear-drive class, the Chevy Camaro V6 went tire-to-
tire with the Hyundai Genesis Coupe 2.0T. Driving all four wheels, the Subaru Impreza 
WRX took on the Mitsubishi Lancer Ralliart. In the front-drive class, the new VW GTI 
battled the Mazdaspeed3. 
We tested each car at Chrysler‚Äôs Chelsea, Mich., Proving Grounds, then blitzed the 
rural Ohio back roads before spending two days on the Nelson Ledges Road Course. 
This 2-mile, seven-turn racetrack is just as tough and gritty as our sporty steeds. The 
rough, pockmarked surface chews up tires, and the undulating pavement puts a beat-
ing on any suspension system. Hot laps around the track‚Äîand the time spent swap-
ping stories of the day‚Äôs adventures‚Äîwere invaluable to our testing regimen. And, yes, 
extraordinarily fun too. Sure, we burned up plenty of rubber and fuel to get the quickest 
times. But speed was not our sole criterion. These cars were judged on how well they 
connected with the driver and how enjoyable they were to drive in all conditions.

You won‚Äôt Ô¨Ånd a car 
that turns more heads 
for less money than the 
Camaro. Folks still stop and 
stare at this concept car come 
to life, likely unaware of its 
basement-level $22,995 entry 
price. In keeping with the 
spirit of the test, we skipped 
the V8 option and tested the 
less-expensive 304-hp V6 
paired to the six-speed 
automatic. We were surprised 
at the powertrain‚Äôs effective-
ness. The 24-valve V6 pulls 
briskly and manages to haul 
the hefty 3779-pound coupe 
into 14-second quarter-mile 
territory. Better still, the 
Camaro returned an excellent 
26.55 mpg‚Äîthe second best 
in this test.
The Bowtie bruiser, 
however, had some chassis 
deÔ¨Åciencies. The Camaro was 
impressive in our handling 
tests and managed a 
second-best run around 
Nelson Ledges, thanks to its 
tenacious grip. But the 
steering wheel jitters over 
bumps, and it feels like a 
layer of molasses coats every 
engagement point between 
you and the road. The 
Camaro is isolated and aloof. 
The gun-slit windows offer 
poor visibility and create 
another layer of fog between 
the driver and the road. Of all 
the cars here, the Camaro‚Äôs 
design is universally striking. 
But even that 1960s cool 
couldn‚Äôt create a lasting bond 
with our testers when we 
pointed the Camaro‚Äôs nose 
toward twisty roads. The 
Camaro‚Äôs beauty does go 
beyond skin deep, but not as 
much as it should.

¬í The Good: Equal division of labor‚Äîthe front wheels turn, and 
the rears put down the power, so the only limit on horsepower is 
traion. e car‚Äôs weight is more evenly diÔ¨Üributed, which works 
all four tires equally in the turns. ¬í The Bad: e drivesha 
tunnel soaks up interior space. On slippery surfaces, traion is an 
issue, and when the tires break loose, a rear-driver tends to 
Ô¨Åshtail. ¬í The Bottom Line: Generally, the beÔ¨Ü option for 
optimum, neutral handling. A required layout for lurid power slides.

Earlier this year,  
our testing placed the 
performance of the V6 
Genesis Coupe within a 
stopwatch tick of the InÔ¨Åniti 
G37 Coupe. Impressive. 
Unfortunately, the lower-price 
210-hp four-cylinder motor 
doesn‚Äôt deliver the same 
thrills. But a powerplant is 
only one part of the package. 
The rest of this car, especially 
the chassis, is magic. Our test 
unit wore the optional Track 
pack with a stiffer suspension. 
Thus equipped, the ride is a 
bit rough. Upside? The 
handling moves three notches 
up the crispness scale. The 
Hyundai digs in and drifts 
beautifully‚Äî as a proper 
rear-drive car should. The 
suspension deftly communi-
cates the moves those tires 
make, right up the steering 
column and into the driver‚Äôs 
hands. This Hyundai bestows 
conÔ¨Ådence in the driver in 
every corner and on every lap. 
The stability-control system 
intervenes gently, and the 
brakes are powerful, offering 
fade-free performance on the 
track. The Hyundai really 
bonds with the driver, and 
that, in turn, inspires the 
driver to use every bit of 
performance the chassis 
offers. After all, a willing 
partner is always better‚Äîand 
more fun‚Äîthan a powerful 
but indifferent companion.

While numbers don‚Äôt 
accurately portray the 
Mitsubishi‚Äôs talents, the 
WRX‚Äôs Ô¨Ågures speak 
volumes. The 265-hp Ô¨Çat 
four-cylinder engine is 
burdened with only 3235 
pounds to pull around the 
racetrack. And unlike the 
traction-challenged 
Mazdaspeed3, the WRX has 
all-wheel drive‚Äîso every 
pony is channeled to the 
ground. The WRX is a 
scrappy, point-and-shoot 
specialist. The blown motor 
suffers little turbo lag and 
dispatches straights with 
startling brevity. Directional 
changes take an aggressive 
hand. You pitch this car, 
rather than delicately thread 
an arc, and count on the 
all-wheel drive to handle 
corner exits. While the WRX 
has an excellent, everyday, 
plush ride, it leans dramati-
cally into the corners. And 
the body heaves and bobs, 
which makes the driver 
wonder just which way the 
car wants to go. The brakes 
are another conÔ¨Ådence killer 
because they fade quickly 
and the pedal gets spongy. 
Finally, there‚Äôs the overly 
stiff clutch, which really saps 
the fun of rowing the 
manual gearbox.
The leather-wrapped 
steering wheel falls perfectly 
to hand, and the seats are 
all-day comfortable. Better 
quality interior plastic, 
however, would be more 
Ô¨Åtting in this $30,000 car. 
Though the WRX 
includes heated seats, 
automatic climate control, 
Bluetooth and touchscreen 
navigation, we‚Äôd skip all of it 
for a tauter suspension to 
match the Subaru‚Äôs 
straight-line speed. 
¬í The Good: It has roughly double the traion of two-wheel drive 
and isn‚Äôt hampered by weight transfer. Handling can be aÔ¨Äeed by 
how the power is divided between the axles. AWD allows 
automakers to raise horsepower without increasing torque Ô¨Üeer.  
¬í The Bad: Not only is the hardware expensive, the extra weight 
and mechanical drag hurt fuel economy. ¬í The Bottom Line: 
JuÔ¨Ü because an AWD car can accelerate quickly in snow, that 
doesn‚Äôt mean it can turn or Ô¨Üop any better than its 2WD brethren.

e Ralliart is a 
perfect example of 
why hard test numbers often 
fail to tell the whole story. 
The car is not as powerful  
or outrageously quick as 
some. But the Mitsubishi's 
engaging personality 
extends far beyond the  
spec sheet. 
The Ralliart's all-wheel 
drive and dual-clutch 
transmission make the 
Mitsu heavy, but they meld 
into a car that‚Äôs a tactile 
delight. Ours included a set 
of fantastically supportive 
front seats. The steering 
wheel has just the right 
thickness. And a pair of 
gorgeous magnesium 
paddles that wouldn‚Äôt be  
out of place in a Ferrari  
Ô¨Çank the wheel and operate 
the gearbox. 
Ergonomically, the 
Mitsubishi is close to 
perfection. And while the 
ultimate grip is low, you 
always know exactly what 
the tires are doing. This car 
doesn‚Äôt pound the pave-
ment; it conforms to it, 
deftly accommodating any 
surface. It‚Äôs sublimely 
balanced. That capability 
imparts conÔ¨Ådence. We 
comfortably explored up to 
and beyond this car‚Äôs limits 
on the racetrack. The 
Ralliart makes you look and 
feel like a better driver.

In the hot hatchback 
class, the Mazda-
speed3 is the bully. Armed 
with 280 lb-ft of torque and 
263 hp, the Mazda smokes 
the front tires at will. That 
much grunt requires a 
delicate balancing act at the 
dragstrip‚Äîtoo much 
throttle bakes the tires; too 
little, and the motor bogs. 
But don‚Äôt be fooled by the 
Mazda‚Äôs seemingly 
unremarkable acceleration 
times compared to the 
others; it‚Äôs a rocket. The 
racetrack lap times tell a 
more accurate story‚Äîit 
outran everything by nearly 
2 seconds. Driven aggres-
sively, the body moves more 
than the taut GTI. It feels as 
though the engineers tuned 
in ride comfort at the 
expense of handling. Those 
extra body motions erode 
driver conÔ¨Ådence. 
There‚Äôs Ô¨Çypaper-like grip 
from the big tires, and the 
Mazda is benign when that 
grip runs out. But the 
steering tends to wander 
under full power and, yes, 
launching hard in Ô¨Årst gear, 
you feel the torque tug in 
your hands. 
The Mazda‚Äôs muscular 
rawness split our testers 
down the middle. Some 
loved its hair-on-Ô¨Åre urgency. 
Others thought the Mazda 
needed all-wheel drive to 
tame that power. Inside, the 
dash is awash with too many 
buttons. The materials are a 
little low-rent and a little 
unsophisticated. Those 
gripes aside, the Mazda‚Äôs 
combination of a bargain 
price tag (under $24,000) and 
outright speed make it the 
undisputed bang-for-the-
buck winner of this test.

e new GTI carries 
the VW performance 
torch lit 27 years ago by the 
very Ô¨Årst Rabbit GTI. And it 
is impressive. The GTI may 
be down on power com-
pared to most here, but 
VW‚Äôs performance deÔ¨Åes 
hard numbers‚Äîit‚Äôs so full of 
heart and spunk that we felt 
an immediate bond with it. 
The steering is nearly 
telepathic. The body 
motions are tightly con-
trolled, yet the chassis 
doesn‚Äôt hammer occupants 
over rough-patched roads. 
The brake pedal summons 
the perfect linear response 
too. Equipped with the 
Direct Shift Gearbox (DSG), 
an automated dual-clutch 
transmission, the GTI 
performs brilliantly quick 
shifts. The engine snarls 
with a sinister but sophisti-
cated exhaust note that 
wouldn‚Äôt be out of place on a 
$50,000 Audi sports car. And 
it sounds hauntingly good, 
howling along the front 
straight at Nelson Ledges. 
The responses from this car 
are so precise, it feels as 
though you could take one 
corner at maximum speed 
over and over again and 
make the tire contact the 
same square foot of 
pavement every time. No 
surprise then, the GTI  
was the fastest in our 
handling tests. 
Inside, the GTI has the 
highest quality interior of all 
six cars. Everything feels 
solid and crafted from 
materials normally found on 
cars one price class up. 
The scope of this car‚Äôs 
capabilities is impressive. 
Fold the rear seats, and it 
holds 46.1 cubic feet of 
whatever you‚Äôre packing. 
More importantly, the VW is 
not only a responsive little 
road burner‚Äîit provides a 
more cohesive package than 
just about any car here.  FC

IF YOU CAN BUILD A BOX, YOU CAN BUILD ALMOST ANYTHING. BUILD 
10 BOXES, AND YOU CAN FURNISH A ROOM. BY JOSEPH TRUINI
¬í If you‚Äôre looking for a way to Ô¨Çex 
your DIY muscles, then buÔ¨Ü out the 
tools, because we‚Äôve got the perfe 
winter woodworking project. It‚Äôs 
possible to build a fun and versatile 
contemporary furniture syÔ¨Üem that 
consiÔ¨Üs almoÔ¨Ü entirely of Ô¨Üackable 
plywood cubes. e beauty of it is that 
the parts can be arranged in various 
conÔ¨Ågurations in minutes, adapting to 
your needs or sense of design. From 
these basic parts, we‚Äôve been able to 
create shelving, a desk, a work table, a 
coÔ¨Äee table, a bed‚Äîand you can inno-
vate juÔ¨Ü about any other form of fur-
niture you need. 
Choosing Materials 
¬í We settled on ¬æ-inch-thick maple 
plywood. It‚Äôs a relatively expensive 
material, coÔ¨Üing about $64 per sheet, 
but for your money you get Ô¨Üraight,

¬í A cube is nothing 
more than four 
pieces of maple 
plywood, with 
iron-on veneer 
applied to conceal 
the plywood‚Äôs layers. 
It is assembled with 
yellow carpenter‚Äôs 
glue and pneumatic 
Ô¨Ånish nails.  
To make a larger 
Ô¨Üruure, join cubes 
using 1¬º-inch 
drywall screws,

Start With a Basic   
    Cube and Go From ere 
smooth panels that take Ô¨Üain or a clear 
Ô¨Ånish equally well and can be painted to 
match or contraÔ¨Ü the surroundings. 
e core is a group of 10 14-inch-
square cubes which can be used as 
they are or combined with cuÔ¨Üom-size 
panels, which are nothing more than a 
double thickness of ¬æ-inch 
plywood. e bottom panel 
doesn‚Äôt need to be maple 
plywood. It can be any Ô¨Çat, 
smooth Ô¨Üock, such as parti-
cleboard. 
To give the pieces a Ô¨Ån-
ished look and to conceal 
the exposed edges of the 
plywood, we used iron-on 
maple-veneer edge banding. 
is is absolutely the quick-
est, easiest way to apply 
veneer. e banding comes 
coated with a heat-aivated 
glue. Just press down the 
veneer with a clothes iron, 
and it bonds in seconds to 
the plywood. We used 
13/16-inch-wide veneer edge 
banding to cover the cube 
edges and 19/16-inch-wide 
veneer to conceal the edges 
of double-thickness panels.
Cutting the Pieces 
¬í We Ô¨Üarted by using a 
circular saw and a relatively 
coarse and fast-cutting 
24-tooth thin kerf blade. With 
this, we cut the large ply-
wood sheets into easier-to-
handle panels. Next, these 
pieces went through a table 
saw equipped with a smooth-
cutting 80-tooth ATB (alter-
nate top bevel) blade. 
For each cube, you‚Äôll need 
two 14 x 14‚Äìinch pieces, 
and two 12¬Ω x 14‚Äìinch 
pieces. We ripped the ply-
wood panels into 14-inch-
wide Ô¨Ürips on the table saw, 
and then crosscut each Ô¨Ürip 
into 14 x 14‚Äìinch squares. 
Next, we readjuÔ¨Üed the rip 
fence to 12¬Ω inches and 
crosscut 14-inch-wide Ô¨Ürips 
to create the corresponding reangular 
12¬Ω x 14‚Äìinch pieces.
Building the Cubes
¬í e plywood cubes are glued and 
nailed together with simple butt joints. 
The 12¬Ω-inch pieces fit between the 
14-inch-square pieces to create the 
14 x 14‚Äìinch units. Spread some yellow 
glue on a joint, then nail the parts 
together. To speed up the process, we 
used a 16-gauge pneumatic Ô¨Ånishing 
nailer and 2-inch nails. You could use a 
hammer and 2-inch (6d) Ô¨Ånishing nails, 
but it would take quite a bit longer. 
ere are 16 nails in each cube (four 
nails per joint), which means you have to

P M  D I Y  H O M E  /// C U B E S
I L L U S T R AT I O N S  B Y  G A B R I E L  S I LV E I R A

drive 160 nails to conÔ¨Üru 10 cubes. 
Also, it‚Äôs just easier to assemble the 
cubes so they are perfely square using 
a pneumatic nailer. Hold the parts in 
position with a square held across the 
corner to be sure the parts are aligned, 
then Ô¨Åre in a nail. Be sure your support-
ing hand is well away from where the 
nail is Ô¨Åred. e pneumatic nailer auto-
matically sets the nailhead.
Aer the plywood cubes were nailed 
together, we Ô¨Ålled each nail hole with 
wood Ô¨Åller and then set the cubes aside 
until the glue cured, about 4 hours. 
Veneering Sequence 
¬í Cut a slightly overlong veneer 
Ô¨Ürip using a pair of scissors and place 
it on the edge of a cube so its edges 
overhang the plywood‚Äôs thickness 
equally on both sides. With the iron 
adjuÔ¨Üed to the (no Ô¨Üeam) cotton set-
ting, hold the strip down for 10 to 12 
seconds. Once the heat has activated 
the glue, rub down the veneer edge 
banding with a wood block. We 
repeated the process on the other end 
of the strip to ensure that both ends 
were Ô¨Årmly bonded. 
Here‚Äôs the sequence that follows the 
first edge: We applied veneer to the 
opposite, parallel edge of the cube, and 
aer veneering the Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü two edges, we 
cut two pieces of edge banding to Ô¨Åt 
between the Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü two. To do the laÔ¨Ü 
two Ô¨Ürips accurately, and without gaps, 
simply butt each piece of veneer up to 
one edge and then mark across it with a 
square and a sharp pencil where it 
meets the adjacent veneer. Cut the 
veneer to length and teÔ¨Ü its Ô¨Åt. When 
the crosspieces are cut, they‚Äôre ironed 
on to complete the edge banding. 
Now you turn to a metalworking 
tool to trim the veneer to Ô¨Ånished size. 
We like to use a single-cut mill baÔ¨Üard 
file to smooth the veneer 
edges flush with the ply-
wood. Filing is much quicker 
and neater than sanding, 
especially when you con-
sider all the edges that muÔ¨Ü 
be trimmed on every cube. 
It‚Äôs important to hold the 
file at a shallow 5- to 
10-degree angle, to allow 
the sharp edge of the Ô¨Åle to 
cut. Also, you‚Äôre less likely to 
tear the veneer loose by 
sweeping the Ô¨Åle along the 
edge, moving it toward the 
cube, not away. You know 
you‚Äôre doing it correly when 
your Ô¨Åling aion removes a 
thin strip of veneer rather 
than creating duÔ¨Ü.  
Finishing Steps
¬í After building and 
veneering all the compo-
nents, we sanded the inside 
and outside surface of every 
cube using an orbital Ô¨Ånish-
ing sander. If you‚Äôre not as 
fussy as we are, you can juÔ¨Ü 
sand the cube‚Äôs outside. 
Don‚Äôt use a belt sander or 
even a random-orbit sander; 
those tools are far too 
aggressive and can easily 
sand right through the maple 
veneer tape. We Ô¨Üarted sanding very 
lightly with 150-grit aluminum oxide 
paper to smooth the surface and level 
the wood Ô¨Åller, then switched to 220-
grit for the Ô¨Ånal smoothing.
We wiped away sanding duÔ¨Ü with a 
tack cloth and sprayed on a coat of 
aerosol primer.  For a proje that will be 
painted, we prefer a quick-drying, sand-
able coating such as Kilz Original. It‚Äôs 
oil-based and can be topcoated with 
alkyd or latex. Once the primer dried, 
we lightly hand-sanded with 220-grit 
abrasive paper, wiped down the sur-
faces with the tack cloth and applied a 
second primer coat. For a clear Ô¨Ånish, 
skip the primer and simply apply two 
coats of clear polyurethane varnish.
Finally, we lightly hand-sanded all 
outside surfaces once again with 220-
grit abrasive paper, duÔ¨Üed oÔ¨Ä with a 
tack cloth and brushed on a coat of 
semigloss latex paint.

Clean caulking comes down to 
three things: the position of the 
caulk gun, the speed that you move 
the gun and the opening that you cut 
in the end of the tube. Sure, gadgets 
may improve the process, but caulking 
is a simple DIY skill. Once you learn 
how to do it, it‚Äôs easy and predictable 
without the use of additional devices. 
It‚Äôs also a fact that caulk is overused 
Q
I hate caulking. Maybe it‚Äôs 
me, but I‚Äôve tried caulk-

 looking. Even my kids com-

today. It‚Äôs not a building material. It‚Äôs 
oen used to Ô¨Åll gaps and make up for 
sloppy workmanship, but no matter 
what you do, it will always look lousy 
when applied in those circumstances. 
And while I‚Äôm on this soapbox, another 
culprit is the $1.99 caulk gun. Step-
ping up to a pro-level gun that costs 
just $5 makes a world of diÔ¨Äerence in 
getting caulk to look neat. The pres-
sure you produce with a pro-quality 
gun is consistent and its pump action 
is predictable and much smoother.
So let‚Äôs Ô¨Üart with the tube. Cut its

e nozzle tip may have lines marked 
into it to indicate where to cut it. In 
almost all cases, I find the caulk 
extrudes more neatly if the tube open-
ing is cut closer to the tip than the man-
ufaurer recommends. A smaller bead 
is neater and there‚Äôs simply less mate-
rial to Ô¨Ürike oÔ¨Ä if you need to clean up 
the joint with your index Ô¨Ånger. 
If you Ô¨Ånd that the bead of caulk is 
too small, you can always cut a little 
bit more oÔ¨Ä the nozzle tip. Finally, if a

slight burr remains on the 
nozzle aer you cut it, be 
sure to remove it by care-
fully paring with the knife. 
Next, hold the caulk 
gun in the joint so the tube 
tip meets the surface at 
a compound 45-degree 
angle. I‚Äôm right-handed, so 
I usually brace the nozzle 
with my left hand and 
squeeze the handle gently 
while simultaneously 
drawing the gun slowly 
down the joint or around 
the surface. Don‚Äôt squeeze 
the handle again until 
there‚Äôs an appreciable 
drop-oÔ¨Ä in the caulk com-
ing out of the nozzle. Get 
the timing and pressure 
right and you can produce 
long, smooth runs with a 
single pump of the handle. 
Except when Ô¨Üarting to run a bead in 
a corner, I oen place the tip of my 
index Ô¨Ånger over the joint. With a little 
downward pressure, my fingertip 
smooths the caulk as it comes out. 
e result is a nice smooth bead that 
doesn‚Äôt need further wiping.
When, despite your best effort, 
you find that the joint needs extra 
wiping to look good, draw a moiÔ¨Ü-
ened Ô¨Ånger down the joint (assuming 
you‚Äôre using a latex or latex blend). If 
you‚Äôre using a caulk that requires 
cleanup with mineral spirits, wear a 
disposable nitrile glove on the hand 
that you use to Ô¨Ürike away excess 
material. e glove reduces the wear 
and tear on your Ô¨Ånger and will make 
cleanup easier when you‚Äôre done. 
Peel the glove. Toss it out.
Buzzing Dimmer 
I have a dimmer switch that makes 
a light in my kitchen give oÔ¨Ä an 
annoying buzz. What causes this? 
What can I do to Ô¨Üop the noise? 
It‚Äôs a common complaint, and it‚Äôs easy 
to Ô¨Åx if you underÔ¨Üand the phenome-
non. ‚Äúe magnetic Ô¨Åeld created by 
the current Ô¨Çowing through the bulb‚Äôs 
filament can cause the 
filament‚Äôs supports to 
move,‚Äù according to Rus-
sell Weightman, principal 
engineer at Lutron, the 
company that invented 
the electronic dimmer 
switch. That movement 
causes the familiar and 
annoying buzz. 
Some background is 
helpful. A dimmer is an 
eleronic switch that cuts 
and restores current to 
the bulb 120 times a sec-
ond, literally chopping the 
current‚Äôs sine wave. ‚Äúink 
of the Ô¨Ålament as a tuning 
fork,‚Äù Weightman says. 
‚ÄúThe normal alternating 
current is like a so pillow. 
Chopped up, the current is 
more like a hard table. 
Strike a tuning fork on a 
pillow and you won‚Äôt produce much 
noise, but it will resonate if you Ô¨Ürike 
it on a table.‚Äù at resonance is great-
est at the midlevel setting because 
the wave is chopped vertically in half 
and then goes instantly to its peak 
when the current is reÔ¨Üored. Hence 
the jolt to the bulb‚Äôs Ô¨Ålament is moÔ¨Ü 
pronounced and the buzzing is loud-
eÔ¨Ü. Similarly, the buzzing will be more 
pronounced if you use a high-wattage 
bulb. Wattage is equal to the voltage 
multiplied by the current. erefore, a 
bulb with a higher wattage draws 
more current and will produce a louder 
buzz. Probably the easieÔ¨Ü solution is 
to switch to a lower wattage bulb. 
If you need more light than a lower 
wattage bulb aÔ¨Äords, you can also opt 
to inÔ¨Üall a rough-service/garage-door-
opener bulb with a rugged Ô¨Ålament 
that is less prone to vibration. Finally, if 
the buzzing persiÔ¨Üs, you can go so far 
as to inÔ¨Üall an eleronic lamp debuzz-
ing coil (LDC) in the circuit. Although it 
sounds Ô¨Åitious, like a board Ô¨Üretcher, 
it‚Äôs real. LDCs (which cost $100 to 
$130) are eleronic Ô¨Ålters that slow 
the inrush of current. Now the odd 
part. They hum softly, so the bulb

doesn‚Äôt. at means you have to wire 
the LDC in a junion box where the hum 
won‚Äôt be noticeable, such as in a base-
ment. It‚Äôs extra expense, wiring and 
trouble, so it‚Äôs usually reserved for trou-
blesome, large-wattage dimming loads.
Smoky Fireplace 
Our house was built in 1982, and 
when we moved in a couple of 
years ago we noticed a Ô¨Ürong 
smoky odor coming from the 
Ô¨Åreplace. We‚Äôve done 
everything we can to 
eliminate it, including having 
the chimney cleaned (twice) 
and inÔ¨Üalling a new damper, a 
new Ô¨Åreplace insert and a 
new chimney cap. It can be 
particularly bad in the 
summer, when the a/c runs. 
We‚Äôre reluant to use the 
Ô¨Åreplace this winter for fear 
of making the problem worse.
The problem is probably not 
with the chimney, the insert or 
the new hardware‚Äîbut you‚Äôre 
also not the only one dealing 
with a fairly common issue.
‚ÄúChimneys stink all the 
time,‚Äù says Ashley Eldridge, 
director of education for the 
Chimney Safety Institute of 
America. ‚Äúe only queÔ¨Üion is

Workhorse
DIESELS PROVIDE MOUNTAINS 
OF TORQUE, GREAT FUEL 
EFFICIENCY AND UNBEATABLE 
DURABILITY‚ÄîBUT ONLY IF  
YOU TREAT THEM RIGHT.  
BY JOHN DECKER
 Clattering along, your diesel pickup 
returns amazingly good fuel economy, 
considering the size of the trailer you 
usually tow. Unfortunately, the truck 
isn‚Äôt pulling as hard these days. Now  
it downshis several times and Ô¨Ürug-
gles to crest grades that it used to 
conquer easily. A glance in the mirror 
reveals a thick cloud of black smoke, 
leaving specks of carbon Ô¨Çecking the 
priÔ¨Üine Ô¨Åberglass of your bass boat. 
Time for a little work under the hood.
Each year, a new crop of diesel 
cars and trucks are introduced, oÔ¨Äer-
ing better mileage, torque and drive-
ability, as well as reduced soot and 
emissions. But properly maintained 
older diesels die hard. e typical die-
sel with 200 K on the odometer is juÔ¨Ü 
now getting broken in. So you‚Äôll want 
to treat your older diesel well to make 
it laÔ¨Ü. Let‚Äôs get Ô¨Üarted.

Clearing the Air 
 Diesels don‚Äôt use throttle plates to 
limit air intake the way spark-ignition 
(gasoline) engines do. It‚Äôs the fuel injec-
tion that varies the engine‚Äôs power out-
put by simply adding more fuel to a Ô¨Åxed 
amount of air. Diesel air/fuel ratios are 
much higher than in a gasoline engine, 
which typically operates at around 
14.7:1 air/fuel. Diesel mixture ratios are 
as high as 100:1 at idle and about 50:1 
while driving. (at‚Äôs one reason diesels 
use far less fuel at idle than spark- 
ignition engines.) at means there‚Äôs a 
lot of air traveling through a diesel‚Äôs air 
cleaner even at idle‚Äîessentially juÔ¨Ü as 
much as a gasoline engine at wide-open 
throttle. So diesel air cleaners are larger 
to allow for all that airÔ¨Çow. ey 
can get dirty quickly on dusty 
roads, so they need to be checked, 
cleaned or replaced frequently.  
A sure sign of a dirty air cleaner ele-
ment is black smoke from the tail-
pipe; the dirt reÔ¨Üriing the airÔ¨Çow 
allows the injeion pump to Ô¨Çow 
more fuel than can burn com-
pletely, making the engine run too 
rich‚Äîand smoky. MoÔ¨Ü diesel air 
cleaners are changed the same 
way as gas engine Ô¨Ålters: Wipe the 
exterior of the housing down, open 
the air cleaner box and remove the 
old air cleaner. Wipe out any dirt, 
grass or dead bugs, then slip the 
new air cleaner into position. 
Prophylaxis
 When a diesel fuel Ô¨Ålter Ô¨Üarts 
to clog, the engine loses power. 
But this condition will be diÔ¨Écult 
to discern right away. That‚Äôs 
because the engine will run 
smoothly and cleanly with no hesi-
tation, producing less and less 
power as the Ô¨Ålter becomes more 
and more plugged. Eventually, 
you‚Äôll notice when cars are whiz-
zing by you on the highway. e 
good news? Changing the Ô¨Ålter will 
bring back the zip you didn‚Äôt know 
you were missing during those 
many months before. 
Fuel Ô¨Ålters should be changed 
at faory-recommended intervals. But 
be aware that many fuel Ô¨Ålters have a 
water separator at the bottom of the 
Ô¨Ålter. If so, there will be a valve at the 
bottom to allow you to drain any water.
Diesel injeors and pumps don‚Äôt like 
water, so it‚Äôs important to keep water 
out of the engine. Why? A certain 
amount of water will mix with gasoline, 
while any water in a diesel tank sinks  
to the bottom and sulks. When there‚Äôs 
enough, it‚Äôll be picked up by the pump, 
where it can damage the delicate, close-
tolerance parts in the pump and injec-
tors. Diligence Ô¨Üarts at the gas Ô¨Üation. 
It‚Äôs beÔ¨Ü to Ô¨Åll up at a Ô¨Üation that sells  
a lot of diesel. Truck stops are great 
because they go through thousands of

When the air 
cleaner Ô¨Üarts to 
become clogged, 
the indicator goes 
from green to 
orange, which 
means it‚Äôs time for a 
change. Dodge, Ford 
and other diesel driv-

3. Many European 
diesels have a fully 
enclosed fuel Ô¨Ålter 
that‚Äôs attached to 
the Ô¨Årewall or inner 
fender. Disconne

replace the entire

gallons every day. Condensation and 
rainwater can creep into underground 
tanks that aren‚Äôt in conÔ¨Üant use.
And unlike gasoline, diesel fuel can 
grow baeria. If the diesel-loving critters 
multiply suÔ¨Éciently, they‚Äôll quickly clog 
the fuel Ô¨Ålter. All that changing the Ô¨Ålter 
without killing oÔ¨Ä the baerial infeion 
will do is give you a brief respite until the 
baeria back up in the Ô¨Ålter again. e 
beÔ¨Ü way to Ô¨Ånd out if your diesel fuel has 
a bug problem is to give it the sniÔ¨Ä teÔ¨Ü. If 
it smells like an outhouse at the end of a 
busy summer, you‚Äôve got a problem. 
e cure for diesel-borne baeria is 
to add a biocide additive (available at 
gas Ô¨Üations and parts Ô¨Üores) to the 
fuel to kill the baeria. Using a biocide 
during subsequent fueling will keep the 
problem at bay. However, if the problem 
is severe, you may have to drain the fuel 
syÔ¨Üem completely, or perhaps remove 
the tank for cleaning. 
GM 6.2- and 6.5-liter diesels, like the 
one we worked on for this Ô¨Üory, have a 
fuel Ô¨Ålter between the cylinder heads at 
the back of the engine. Replacing it is  
a simple matter of unscrewing a large 
plaÔ¨Üic retaining ring and then liing the 
pleated Ô¨Ålter from its housing with the 
tabs on the top of the Ô¨Ålter. Before inÔ¨Üall-
ing the new Ô¨Ålter, wipe out the housing. 
InÔ¨Üall the new Ô¨Ålter so the holes under 
the top of the Ô¨Ålter line up with the metal 
tabs on the housing; press the Ô¨Ålter into 
place and screw the retaining ring back 
on, then bleed it. Other trucks will have 
similar, but not identical, procedures. 
Unlike gas Ô¨Ålters, diesel Ô¨Ålters are invari-
ably mounted conveniently to facilitate 
easy, periodic changes. 
Let It Bleed 
 A few short years ago, all diesel-
engine fuel syÔ¨Üems had to be bled to 
remove air whenever work was done to 
the fuel syÔ¨Üem, or if the vehicle ran out 
of fuel or the fuel Ô¨Ålter was changed. 
ese fuel injeors are simple spring-
loaded poppet valves, forced open by 
the hydraulic pressure generated in the 
injeion pump. If the Ô¨Üeel pipe between 
the pump and injeor has air in it, there 
won‚Äôt be enough pressure to force the 
poppet valve open, and the engine will 
turn over endlessly but never start. 
Depending on the vehicle, this means 
having an assistant crank the engine 
over as you individually loosen the fuel 
line to each injeor until you see small 
amounts of fuel seeping out (a lot of fun 
at night on the side of the road). With 
the lines bled, the engine Ô¨Üarts easily. 
But fuel-system maintenance has 
become easier. On some diesels you‚Äôll 
Ô¨Ånd a button on top of the fuel Ô¨Ålter. 
Pressing it 10 to 20 times is suÔ¨Écient 
to bleed the air out of the syÔ¨Üem. My 
Chevy pickup and many others have an 
electric feeder pump on the chassis 
directly under the driver‚Äôs floor pan. 
Turning on the ignition activates the 
pump, which allows you to bleed the 
whole fuel system without cranking 
the engine. Simply attach a hose to the 
bleeder screw near the thermostat 
housing and have an assiÔ¨Üant turn the 
key to the ‚Äúrun‚Äù position until bubble-
free fuel runs from the hose.  
Today, diesel engines with common-
rail fuel injeion have in-tank primary 
pumps that feed fuel to the engine and 
also automatically bleed the system.  
A word of warning here: Never crack  
the injeor Ô¨Åttings or a fuel line on a 
pressurized common-rail fuel syÔ¨Üem, 
because they operate at 20,000 to 
30,000 psi of pressure versus the 1000 
to 3000 psi in older syÔ¨Üems. A minus-
cule leak can easily inje fuel through 
your skin deep into your Ô¨Çesh. Ouch. 
Diesels aren‚Äôt juÔ¨Ü for truckers anymore. 
A Saturday Mechanic shouldn‚Äôt have 
any trouble keeping one running.

Why do diesel engines work so well when it comes to hauling power and 
mileage? ‚ÄúIt all comes down to expansion ratio,‚Äù says Gale Banks, the WeÔ¨Ü CoaÔ¨Ü 
diesel-engine-building guru and president of Gale Banks Engineering. As Banks 
explains it, when air and fuel burn, they expand, creating pressure to drive the piÔ¨Üon 
down. Divide the higheÔ¨Ü pressure when the piÔ¨Üon is at the top of the combuÔ¨Üion 
chamber by the loweÔ¨Ü pressure when the piÔ¨Üon is at the bottom of the cylinder and 
that‚Äôs the expansion ratio. (Not to be confused with the compression ratio, the ratio 
between the maximum and minimum combuÔ¨Üion chamber volumes.) e greater the 
expansion ratio, the more power the engine creates. 
ere‚Äôs more: ‚ÄúDiesel fuel has the higheÔ¨Ü energy density of any fuel we know of,‚Äù 
Banks says. (Roughly 10 percent more energy per gallon than gasoline, depending on 
time of year and the diesel‚Äôs and gasoline‚Äôs parent crude.) Combine that energy density 
with high compression (18 to 22:1 for diesels; gasoline engines are usually between 10 
and 12:1) and diesel‚Äôs ability to resiÔ¨Ü preignition as it‚Äôs compressed, and diesel fuel 
creates a much higher cylinder pressure earlier in the piÔ¨Üon‚Äôs Ô¨Üroke. e result? A 
much greater expansion ratio, delivering higher torque and better fuel economy.

You need to upgrade your Ô¨Çasher 
relay to a heavy-duty flasher. 
Here‚Äôs how those old-fashioned flash-
ers work. ere is a set of switch points 
attached to a bimetal strip, all in series 
with the turn-signal bulbs and the bat-
tery. When the turn signals are 
switched on, current flowing through 
the bimetal strip heats it up, and the 
strip starts to curl, breaking the circuit. 
A second or so later, the strip cools oÔ¨Ä, 
making the connection again, a 
sequence that repeats until the signals 
are canceled. Plug in the trailer, and 
you‚Äôre adding two more filaments to 
draw more current, which makes the 
bimetal strip heat up faster, accelerat-
ing the blink rate. Go down to the auto 
parts store and get a Ô¨Çasher rated for

Altitude Correion
My home and shop are at an elevation 
of 8000 feet. How does this change 
my readings when doing a compres-
sion teÔ¨Ü on my car?
Compression readings are done by 
removing all the spark plugs, attaching 
a compression gauge to an individual 
cylinder and cranking the engine to 
measure the maximum pressure built 
up in the cylinders. 
Expe the readings to be lower at 
altitude than at sea level. Normally, I‚Äôd 
expect to see readings somewhere 
between 120 and 160 psi at sea level, 
but the number will vary, determined by 
your car‚Äôs compression ratio and cam-
sha timing. Depending on the altitude, 
the barometer reading on any given day 
and how robust your battery is, the 
aual readings you get on a compres-
sion teÔ¨Ü can vary 10 to 15 percent up 
or down. What‚Äôs far more important  
is the consiÔ¨Üency between the cylin-
ders. If they‚Äôre all a few pounds low, it 
might be that your battery is juÔ¨Ü a little 
discharged, or the barometer is low, or 
the throttle valve isn‚Äôt propped open far 
enough while cranking the engine. If 
only one is weak, the condition might 
be indicative of a burned valve, leaky 
ring or scored cylinder wall. If two adja-
cent cylinders are very low, I immedi-
ately suspect a blown head gasket 
between them.
Counterintuitively, high-performance 
engines oen show lower compression 
readings because the hot camshafts 
leave the valves open well paÔ¨Ü bottom 
dead center, lowering the eÔ¨Äeive com-
pression ratio.
A number of late-model cars can 
replicate a compression teÔ¨Ü without 
removing the spark plugs. Under the

joints, the articulated 
joints that carry power 
from the diÔ¨Äerential to 
the wheels of cars with 
independent suspensions, 
generally laÔ¨Ü a good long 
time. e mechanical 
parts are bathed in a 
generous handful of 
special grease doped with

molybdenum disulÔ¨Åde, a 
powdered extreme-
 pressure lubricant. As 
long as these parts 
continue to marinate in 
this concoion, they‚Äôll 
laÔ¨Ü the life of the car. 
Unfortunately, the rubber 
boots that keep the 
grease in and the dirt and 
water out are fragile. It‚Äôs a 
good idea to take a 
minute or two every 
month or so, or at leaÔ¨Ü 
every oil change, to

failure. If one splits open, 
it‚Äôs only an hour of labor

clean and relube the joint

they do make split boots

Locked Out
I own a 1969 Ford with a 428 Cobra 
Jet engine and the car conÔ¨Üantly 
Ô¨Üalls. It has a mechanical fuel pump 
and ‚Äúhard‚Äù fuel lines from the pump to 
the carb. I checked the fuel pump 
pressure and it reads 7 pounds. 	e 
car drives anywhere from 1 mile to 
20 miles before it Ô¨Üalls. My next Ô¨Åx is 
to replace the fuel pump, but I am 
wondering if the car is suÔ¨Äering from 
vapor lock. It is a big block with long 
tube headers, so it certainly gets hot 
under the hood. 	e fuel line does not 
touch the block or manifold at any 
point. 	e car had a rubber fuel line 
from the pump to the carb when I 
purchased it, but it was not inÔ¨Üalled 
any farther away from the block or 
manifold than the hard line. If it is 
vapor lock, would changing back to a 
rubber fuel line solve the problem?
I agree, it‚Äôs probably vapor lock, caused 
by liquid fuel boiling in the carb or fuel 
lines, preventing sufficient liquid fuel 
from reaching the jets. e vapor pres-
sure of gasoline is much higher than it 
was in 1969, since we use a lot more of 
the crude oil in the barrel, including a 
higher percentage of more volatile frac-
tions that used to be Ô¨Çared oÔ¨Ä. And it‚Äôs 
those fraions that boil at lower tem-
peratures than the reÔ¨Ü of the fuel. For-
tunately, fuel-injeed cars aren‚Äôt prone 
to vapor lock because the fuel in the 
engine compartment is usually between 
30 and 60 psi, not the seven or less 
used by carbureted vehicles.
Changing back to a rubber line and 
moving it away from the headers might 
help reduce the temperature of the fuel 
inside the lines. JuÔ¨Ü insulating the hard 
line might be enough to prevent boiling. 
e fuel is probably aually boiling in 
the Ô¨Çoat bowl, however, not in the line.

those carbs, and some cars with carbs 
used sheet-metal heat shields to keep 
heat from the headers from radiating 
into the carburetor. 
Toward the end of the carburetor era 
in the ‚Äô80s, some manufaurers resort-
ed to recycling some of the fuel from 
the fuel pump back to the tank. This 
was done with a tee Ô¨Åtting that had a 
small reÔ¨Üriion in one leg of the tee, 
allowing a small trickle of fuel to go 
back to the tank through a separate 
line. e cool fuel from the tank, moving 
continuously through the line, kept the 
fuel from boiling. This required a fuel 
tank with an additional Ô¨Åtting for the 
return line. You might check if your tank 
could be modiÔ¨Åed, or replaced with a 
later model tank with the Ô¨Åtting. Come 
to think of it, the Ô¨Åtting was oen in the 
fuel sender plate, so all you might have 
to change is the fuel sender for one with 
the extra Ô¨Åtting, and then run an addi-
tional line from the engine compart-
ment  back to the tank.
If you have air conditioning, you 
might try my favorite Ô¨Åx: Wrap the fuel 
line around the cold a/c refrigerant line 
as the refrigerant line heads back to the 
compressor from the evaporator. Strip 
oÔ¨Ä the insulation, wrap the hose around 
the cool line, and rewrap with fresh 
insulation. I‚Äôll bet that if the engine is 
hot enough to vapor lock, you‚Äôre hot 
enough to need the air conditioning on.
Hot Problem
I have a 2007 Hyundai Azera. 	e 
dealer replaced the battery laÔ¨Ü 
spring, and it‚Äôs already dead. Also, the 
dealer says that batteries don‚Äôt really 
laÔ¨Ü in Florida. Even if that‚Äôs true, a 
year or less seems like an awfully 
short life span for a battery. 
I‚Äôm going to assume the dealer has 
checked out your charging syÔ¨Üem and 
given it a clean bill of health. As far as his 
assertion that batteries don‚Äôt last in 
Florida, he‚Äôs sort of right. e thing that 
kills batteries is heat, because it boils oÔ¨Ä 
the water in the elerolyte and haÔ¨Üens 
the sulfation process. at‚Äôs when some 
of the lead on the plates of a partially 
discharged battery oxidizes into lead 
sulfate. e lead sulfate interferes with 
the normal charge‚Äìdischarge chemiÔ¨Üry 
of the battery, reducing capacity until 
Ô¨Ånally you can‚Äôt Ô¨Üart your car. 
Although most of the damage is 
done in the summer, the batteries cus-
tomarily fail in colder weather. at‚Äôs 
because cold oil is thicker than warm 
oil, and therefore demands more from 
the Ô¨Üarter motor. Similarly, your car‚Äôs 
elerical demands are higher in winter 
because you‚Äôre running lights and win-
dow defroÔ¨Üers and windshield wipers 
more frequently. But: One year is Ô¨Üill 
abnormally short. I‚Äôd be expecting at 
leaÔ¨Ü a partial warranty.
Here are my suggeÔ¨Üions to make 
your next battery laÔ¨Ü longer:
Use a conventional battery, not a 
maintenance-free one. Periodically 
check the level of elerolyte and add dis-
tilled water as necessary. Maintenance- 
free batteries have no Ô¨Åller caps. ey 
generally do have more Ô¨Üanding elero-
lyte above the plates to compensate, 
but when they‚Äôre in service a lot of water 
boils away, so they can‚Äôt laÔ¨Ü as long as 
conventional batteries that can be 
topped oÔ¨Ä every few months. 
Be sure the dealer has reinÔ¨Üalled 
any battery heat shields that the manu-
faurer inÔ¨Üalled at the faory, to keep 
the battery temperature down.
Avoid parking in the sun.
Be sure the car is driven regularly for 
enough distance to keep the battery 
charged. Vehicles with short driving 
cycles may very well not ever charge 
the battery completely, hastening its 
demise. If this is your problem, you may 
need to use a small battery maintainer 
plugged into the wall, or at leaÔ¨Ü try to 
get out of the house more oen.
Pairing Up
Do both wheel cylinders on the rear 
brakes of a car have to be replaced  
at the same time or can they be done 
one at a time? 	e car only has 
54,000 miles. 
Technically, there is no compelling rea-
son to replace both wheel cylinders or 
both calipers at the same time. But 
economically, it probably does make 
P M  D I Y  A U T O  /// C A R  C L I N I C  Q + A

However, a few of my friends say this 
is a normal condition for a Saturn,  
that they all do it, even when they are 
new. Are they pulling my leg? Or 
should I juÔ¨Ü go ahead and clean the 
throttle body whether it needs the 
work or not?
Well, first-generation Saturns have 
 never been known for good NVH (noise 
vibration and harshness) quotients, but 
the ones I‚Äôve driven over the years 
haven‚Äôt been that bad. Have the shop 
check the engine idle speed, which 
should be pretty near 700 rpm. If the 
idle is low, you‚Äôll notice more idle shake. 
Tampering with the factory-adjusted 
idle screw isn‚Äôt permitted by the service 
manual, for reasons GM doesn‚Äôt specify 
but that probably have to do with emis-
sions requirements. You‚Äôll need to check 
for a metered-air leak, a Ô¨Üicky throttle 
blade, a Ô¨Üicky idle air controller, a leaky 
EGR valve and a half-dozen other things. 
Cleaning the throttle body might help, 
but you should at leaÔ¨Ü try to Ô¨Ågure out 
what the problem is Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü. 
   But wait, there‚Äôs more! ere‚Äôs a ser-
vice bulletin out on your car for the 
upper front engine mount. Check the 
mount: If the rubber is solid, it‚Äôs the old 
style and needs to be replaced with  
the newer Ô¨Üyle. e newer Ô¨Üyle has a  
2-millimeter horizontal slot to make it 
more compliant. If the slot is narrower 
than 2 mm, the mount has collapsed 
and needs to be replaced.
Another taic I‚Äôve used on cars with 
lots of idle shake is to loosen up all the 
bolts on the engine mounts. en Ô¨Üart 
the engine, and‚Äîwith your foot on the 
brake‚Äîput the transmission alterna-
tively in drive and reverse a few times. 
Back to neutral, shut oÔ¨Ä the engine and 
tighten everything up. This should 
realign the engine mounts, and maybe 
lessen the shake.

sense. Both sides have seen the same 
service, and the other one is likely near 
failure. You‚Äôve already got the car up in 
the air, and are replacing the shoes or 
pads on both sides anyway. (Yes, you 
are. Never replace the pads or shoes 
except as a complete set.) And if you‚Äôve 
got one side of the hydraulic syÔ¨Üem 
open, you have to bleed the whole thing 
anyway. The incremental cost to 
replace a wheel cylinder is not large. 
e only reason I‚Äôd skimp is if it meant 
waiting around for parts while I was on 
vacation or something.
Blowing Hot and Cold
I have a 1995 Buick Park Avenue and I 
am having problems with the heating 
syÔ¨Üem inside the car. I get heat only 
from the driver‚Äôs side‚Äîthe passenger 
side blows only cold air. 	e problem 
occurs with the Ô¨Çoor, mid and 
windshield vents, and I do not 
underÔ¨Üand why the driver‚Äôs side is 
working and the passenger‚Äôs is not. 
Split HVAC controls were available on 
your car, allowing the driver and pas-
senger to control the temperature in 
their seats individually. I‚Äôm assuming 
your vehicle has this system, rather 
than the Ô¨Üandard automatic tempera-
ture controls. There are a couple of 
extra air doors, auators and linkages 
for this climate-control syÔ¨Üem. Your 
problem is fairly common in GM vehi-
cles of this vintage, and it‚Äôs usually a 
vacuum leak internally in the program-
mer that routes vacuum to all those 
air-blend doors. It‚Äôs not a cheap part. 
My suggestion is to have your 
 mechanic lock open the air-blend doors 
that control the passenger side, dis-
conne their vacuum lines, and give 
up the dual-control option. 
Bad Vibes
I recently read an article from an old 
PM with inÔ¨Üruions detailing how to 
clean the throttle body in a car. I juÔ¨Ü 
purchased a 1999 Saturn SC1, and 
the little car runs great‚Äîexcept when 
it‚Äôs not moving. It really vibrates while 
sitting in park or at a Ô¨Üop sign. In fa, 
it vibrates so hard it is virtually 
impossible to see clearly in the 
rearview or side mirrors. I think it juÔ¨Ü 
needs some TLC and the aforemen-
tioned cleaning of the throttle body.

crammed inside the machine, which can 
be tricky with a cramped netbook (mine 
fit just above the computer‚Äôs Wi-Fi 
card). From there, it feeds power from 
the motherboard to the screen. Aer 
the hub is hooked up, it will actually 
have two unused internal USB cords. 
These are free to deliver power to 
components. I took one and 
attached a Kensington Bluetooth 
USB Micro Adaptor (one of the 
smallest Bluetooth dongles on 
the market), giving my netbook 
the ability to wirelessly commu-
nicate with a Bluetooth key-
board, mouse or phone. 
Placing the Panel
 Now it was time to attach 
the touchscreen panel. e new 
screen has to be placed on top of 
the old one with perfe alignment. 
To do this, I put the battery back in 
the computer and turned the screen 
on, allowing me to see the LCD‚Äôs exa 
borders. One side of the new touch 
panel comes coated with adhesive, so I 
pressed this side into place over the lit-
up screen. After I restarted the com-
puter, the touchscreen was working‚Äî
and I was able to accurately control the 
cursor with my Ô¨Ånger. But it‚Äôs smart to 
give it a teÔ¨Ü run before you put the com-
puter back together‚Äîjust to be sure 
everything is in place. 
While the laptop was open, I thought 
it couldn‚Äôt hurt to add some upgrades‚Äî
more RAM and a faster and higher 
capacity Ô¨Üorage drive will help a previ-
ously sluggish netbook Ô¨Üave oÔ¨Ä obso-
lescence, at least for a little while. I 
upgraded my machine to 2 GB of DDR2 
SDRAM and a solid-Ô¨Üate Ô¨Üorage drive. 
I was now done and ready to put it all 
back  together again ‚Äîa fairly Ô¨Üraight-
forward procedure. e Ô¨Ånal produ: a 
powerful, portable, touch-friendly com-
puter. Did it let me do anything a normal 
PC couldn‚Äôt do? Not really, although 
that could soon change, now that devel-
opers have the ability to build touch 
capabilities directly into Windows 7 
applications. But it did let me move 
away from the netbook‚Äôs cramped 
touchpad and keyboard and spread my 
hands over a spacious touchscreen. And 
it certainly draws Ô¨Üares when I pull it 
out at a Starbucks. 
FC
Ô¨Üarted with the easy Ô¨ÜuÔ¨Ä: I removed 
the battery, unscrewed the underbelly 
screws and took out the hard drive. 
Removing the keyboard and screen 
bezel was a bit trickier‚Äîthey had to be 
pried oÔ¨Ä with a Ô¨Åled-down plaÔ¨Üic knife 
(plastic is less likely to scratch than 
metal). If you decide to take on this proj-
ect, open the screen and look for a 
seam that runs along the side, around 
the entire machine, either juÔ¨Ü above or 
just below the USB slots. Using the 
knife (or a similar tool), gently pry into 
this seam until the case begins to sepa-
rate. With the underbelly screws 
removed, this should be very easy. To 
take apart the screen bezel, look for a 
similar seam along the side of the dis-
play, and use the knife to pry it apart as 
well. e bezel should pop right oÔ¨Ä.
Of course, the new touchscreen 
needed to get its power from some-
where. e kit comes with an internal 
USB power control hub‚Äîbasically a 
USB hub that is installed inside the 
computer. This hub needs to be 
than $500, including the computer. 
FirÔ¨Ü, I needed to gear up. I bought a 
Lenovo IdeaPad S10-2 netbook (retail 
price: $350) and a Hoda Technology 
Solderless Touch Screen Kit ($96 from 
fidohub.com), which contained every-
thing I‚Äòd need to transform a netbook 
into a touch-friendly tablet. Hoda oÔ¨Äers 
a variety of models that are designed to 
Ô¨Åt speciÔ¨Åc netbooks, so make sure you 
get the right one if you try this at home. 
I wanted to be sure the new touch-
screen was properly proteed, so I pur-
chased a BodyGuardz transparent 
scratch-proof skin, which is designed to 
prote touchscreens without impairing 
their sensitivity. Before covering the 
new panel, I gave it a once-over with a 
can of compressed air‚Äîotherwise, dirt 
and duÔ¨Ü could be forever trapped under 
the BodyGuardz.
Taking the PC Apart
 Next came the fun part. In order 
to wire in the new screen, I Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü needed 
to disassemble much of the netbook. I

also makes them eÔ¨Äeive for keeping 
limited amounts of moisture away 
from eleronic devices. When used 
creatively, silica gel can be a gear 
Ô¨Åend‚Äôs beÔ¨Ü friend.
Whenever I stumble across a 
 packet, I Ô¨Üash it away for later. But if 
you want to jump-Ô¨Üart your colleion 
without buying several pairs of shoes, 
these packets can be purchased 
online at various sites for about 25 
cents each‚Äîless if you buy in bulk.
One of my favorite uses: drying out 
accidentally dunked devices. e key 
is to recover the  sunken gadget as 
soon as possible, remove the battery 
and submerge both in a bowl of silica 
gel packets overnight. The gel will 
suck up lingering moiÔ¨Üure from within 
the gizmo, and it is both safer and 
more effective than turning a hair 
 dryer on your phone, which can fry the 
circuits. (If you‚Äôre short on silica, a 
bowl of dry rice will also work in a 
pinch for this purpose.)
Silica gel packets are also a muÔ¨Ü-
have for underwater photographers 
or videographers who rely on sub-
mergible housings for their cameras. 
Stray specks of water can easily fog 
or Ô¨Üreak the lenses of cameras and 
camcorders, ruining photographs. 
Because silica gel packets are small 
and flexible, they are easy to stuff 
inside the casing along with the cam-
era, ensuring a dry and condensation-
free environment. 
The desiccant is also useful for 
gadget Ô¨Üorage‚Äîeither at home or on 
the road. When I travel, I usually pack 
moÔ¨Ü of my eleronics and chargers 
into a zipper Ô¨Üorage bag. Although 
the zipper seal usually does an ade-
quate job proteing its contents from 
a leaky toiletry bag or bottle that 
might be sharing the suitcase, tossing 
a few packets of silica gel in the bag 
as as an extra insurance policy. And 
popping a packet or two into a sealed 
Tupperware container turns it into a 
perfect place to store a camera or 
GPS device when it isn‚Äôt in use.
ere are, no doubt, many other 
uses for silica gel‚Äôs water-Ô¨Åghting abili-
ties. If you‚Äôve Ô¨Üumbled upon any par-
ticularly creative applications, drop 
me a line at pmdigitalclinic@hearÔ¨Ü

ever, if battery life is an issue, both

heavy apps‚Äîmerely having the Wi-Fi 
or 3G networks turned on is enough 
to cut hours oÔ¨Ä your phone‚Äôs battery

patroller thought a bomb‚Äôs fuse had 
gone out and was attempting a relight 
when it exploded. Now, every bomb in 
Big Sky is threaded with two fuses, and 
is set off by yanking pull-tab igniters.
‚ÄúJust one mistake on this job can 
kill you,‚Äù says Bob Dixon, director of 
the Big Sky patrol, which includes 8 
women, 50 men and a half-dozen 
dogs, including two Australian shep-
herds and a chocolate Lab named 
Mowgli. ‚ÄúBut no matter how careful 
you are, you always deal with the 
unpredictable. Avalanche control is 
30 percent science, 50 percent art 
and 20 percent luck.‚Äù
Researchers are hoping to shift 
these percentages in science‚Äôs favor. 
The world‚Äôs major avalanche-study 
centers are widely scattered‚Äîin 
Davos, Switzerland; in Nagaoka, 
Japan; and just an hour up the road 
from Big Sky, at Montana State Univer-
sity in Bozeman. Last October, under 
the direction of engineering mechan-
ics professor Ed Adams and another 
faculty member, Montana State 
opened its Cold Climate Simulation 
Chamber, a room in which the ceiling 
is chilled to minus 58 F and an artiÔ¨Å-
cial sun shines on a one-square-meter 
slope. The goal is to home in on the 
conditions that create the strongest 
and weakest bonds between layers of 
snow. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a mystique that it‚Äôs  
difficult to accurately predict ava-
lanches,‚Äù Adams tells me when I visit 
the lab. ‚ÄúBut snow is just a material‚Äî
though it is a very complicated one.‚Äù 
Along with a company called 
Thermo Analytics and experts at the 
Swiss Federal Institute for Snow and 
Avalanche Research in Davos, Adams 
has developed software packages that 
promise to boost the accuracy of ava-
lanche forecasts. But for now, away 
from the laboratory, the work is still a 
mix of science and instinct that 
entails long hours‚Äîthe Ô¨Årst patrol-
lers arrive at Big Sky before 4:30 am‚Äî
and lots of explosives. 
By the time the mist settles from the 
Ô¨Årst bomb Ross and Steve set, they‚Äôve 
already skied to the next slide path. 
Here, Steve hangs a bomb from the 
limb of a dead tree. It‚Äôs a tricky work 
environment: Howling wind hampers 
voice communication, dense fog has 
eliminated most visibility, the slope 
they‚Äôre standing on could slide at any 
moment, and of course they are han-
dling deadly explosives. ‚ÄúOur lives are 
literally in each other‚Äôs hands,‚Äù Ross 
says, brushing off the icicles that have 
taken root in his reddish-blond beard.
Ross grew up in the mountains of 
New Hampshire but fell in love with 
the Rockies. ‚ÄúI became a patroller,‚Äù he 
says, ‚Äúafter I failed college philosophy 
because I‚Äôd spent too much time on 
the ski hill.‚Äù He and Steve work with a 
practiced synchronicity and few 
words‚Äîhand gestures, clipped 
 phrases‚Äîas they set off bombs in slide 
areas. Avalanches tumble; the smell of 
sulfur hangs in the air; a spray of black 
powdery residue stains the snow.
Across the resort, 13 more teams 
are working to clear their own patches 
of turf. Explosions blast and echo 
across the cliff faces. The patrollers 
use three types of explosives. Ross and 
Steve are using cast primers. Gel shots, 
which are fat sticks of dynamite,  
are less powerful but have other 
advantages‚Äî for one, they do not leave 
black-powder remains and thus are 
better for south-facing slopes, where 
powder heated by direct sunlight 
could create large melt areas. ANFO, 
ammonium nitrate fuel oil, essentially 
a large bag of fertilizer, can be deto-
nated with either of the other two. 
Big Sky also uses two Buck Rogers‚Äì
looking cannons, called Avalaunch-
ers, which are powered by nitrogen 
gas that propels cast primers‚Äîeach 
fitted with a plastic nose cone, fins 
and a trigger that detonates on impact

only‚Äîhigh onto dangerous-to-reach 
cliff bands. As the early morning pro-
gresses, teams zip by on snowmobiles; 
one patroller, working out of a 
cramped communications center at 
the mountain‚Äôs base, monitors every-
one‚Äôs position. And the resort is open 
to the public by 9:05 am.
Once the avalanche-control work is 
Ô¨Ånished, many of the patrollers hang 
out in one of the lift-top huts, swap-
ping stories, telling jokes and waiting 
for a call if medical help is needed. At 
one hut, Jay Frisque, better known as 
Magnum (‚ÄúBecause his patroller num-
ber is 44, and because he‚Äôs a badass,‚Äù 
Ross says), has cooked up antelope 
sausage burritos over a portable stove 
for a crowd of hungry patrollers. It‚Äôs 
an addictive profession, Magnum 
says, grinning slyly‚Äîso long as you 
crave horrible weather, sweaty co-
workers and a guarantee that you‚Äôll 
never be rich. ‚ÄúThere isn‚Äôt a person in 
this room,‚Äù he adds, ‚Äúthat I wouldn‚Äôt 
risk my life for. Or bail out of jail.‚Äù
The day ends where it begins‚Äîin 
the patrol locker room. In a posh 
resort like Big Sky, the locker room is 
the equivalent of a teenager‚Äôs back- 
of-the-garage hangout. Stickers are 
pasted everywhere. A couple of slices 
of old pizza are strewn on the Ô¨Çoor. 
One ski, cracked in half and mounted 
on the wall, is signed by a patroller 
who got buried in an avalanche and 
was dug out by co-workers. There‚Äôs 
also a ski from each of the two Big Sky 
patrollers who have died on the job.
I conduct a precise inventory of the 
locker-room‚Äôs refrigerator: 216 cans of 
Pabst Blue Ribbon beer and nothing 
else‚Äînot so much as a packet of 
ketchup. (A patroller needs to bring  
a case of beer every time he or she com-
mits what‚Äôs known as an R.B.O.‚Äîa 
round-buying offense‚Äîwhich includes 
such infractions as getting your back-
pack stuck in the slats of a chairlift or 
taking a big fall in front of the public.)
Beers are distributed as the after-
noon wanes, but no one pops the top, 
or starts to change out of uniform, 
until the last of the on-duty patrollers 
enter the locker room. That‚Äôs a strict 
patroller tradition, I‚Äôm told. They 
won‚Äôt even take their boots off until 
everyone is safely home.

Burt FoÔ¨Üer has made knives that can chop through a 2 x 4, shave hair oÔ¨Ä an arm 
and bend 90 degrees. Spurred by a childhood fascination with the outdoors and knives, 
he decided at 29 to turn a longtime hobby into a profession. Only 114 people in the world‚Äî
including FoÔ¨Üer‚Äîhold the title of MaÔ¨Üer Bladesmith, which is beÔ¨Üowed on those who have at 
leaÔ¨Ü four years of experience and can forge knives that withÔ¨Üand the American Bladesmith 
Society‚Äôs rigorous teÔ¨Üs. FoÔ¨Üer works moÔ¨Üly by hand, spending between six and 50 hours on 
each creation. ‚ÄúKnifemaking is not like punching a clock,‚Äù FoÔ¨Üer says. ‚Äúere are no templates 
or patterns. Very little of what I do is ever repeated exaly.‚Äù  ‚Äî EMILY HAILE

FoÔ¨Üer heats up carbon Ô¨Üeel, 
then shapes it using this Ô¨Çoor-
mounted hammer. e head 
weighs 70 pounds and can 
Ô¨Ürike three times per second. 
‚ÄúI love forging by hand,‚Äù FoÔ¨Üer 
says, ‚Äúbut this hammer saves 
me a lot of wear on my elbows 
and shoulders.‚Äù 
2. qq   
To forge blades by hand, 
FoÔ¨Üer uses a 250-pound anvil 
and a 3-pound sledgehammer 
he bought more than a decade 
ago at Home Depot. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not 
a fancy European forging ham-
mer,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúbut I‚Äôm Ô¨Üicking 
with it, because it works.‚Äù

Accurate to within 3 degrees 
Fahrenheit, this digitally 
controlled oven can maintain 
1500 F‚Äîthe temperature at 
which the carbon in the Ô¨Üeel 
dissolves and is absorbed into 
iron. e blade is then rapidly 
cooled in water or oil, which 
changes the Ô¨Üeel‚Äôs molecular 
Ô¨Üruure. Next, the metal is 
repeatedly heated and soaked, 
which makes it more resiÔ¨Üant 
to breaking.

FoÔ¨Üer uses a KMG  
belt grinder with a 2-hp  
motor and a variable-speed 
drive to grind blades, shape 
handles and dress the edges  
of leather sheaths. 
5.    
To hand-Ô¨Ånish blades, Ô¨Åttings 
and handles, FoÔ¨Üer needs 
sandpaper‚Äîand lots of it. 
A $1500 knife may have $5 
worth of Ô¨Üeel and $50 worth 
of sandpaper inveÔ¨Üed in it.
