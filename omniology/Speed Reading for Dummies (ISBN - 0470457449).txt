Dedication
This book is dedicated to the pioneers, researchers, teachers, and 
entrepreneurs who from 1880 to the present have provided a solid 
base upon which to build my company’s innovative, award-winning 
program that teaches silent reading fluency. I’m proud to bring 
their teachings into the 21st century.
Author’s Acknowledgements
Where to begin? First with my wife, Wink Blair, who has been a 
solid rock of support during the years that I’ve spent on my entre-
preneurial ventures. I thank her from the bottom of my heart.
I thank my second family too. My partners in The Literacy Company 
(TLC): Rich Coppola, the co-developer of TLC’s technology, and 
Lance Leishman, TLC’s Operations Manager, ran the company while 
I was engaged in researching and writing this book.
A special thanks goes to Wiley Publishing for giving me the oppor-
tunity to present what I believe will be a road map to change the 
nation’s reading curriculum. I want to thank Michael Lewis for his 
support and for understanding that there is a world of difference 
between subject matter knowledge, which I do have, and the ability 
to write a For Dummies book, which I do not have. Michael arranged 
for me to have the very best professional writer, Peter Weverka, 
work with me. Without Peter’s partnership, this book could not 
have been written. Also at Wiley, I want to thank Alissa Schwipps 
and Megan Knoll. It’s incredibly eye-opening to observe the enor-
mous improvements made by professional editing. I take my hat off 
to them.
I also want to thank Bill Cowles of SkillPath Seminars and Tom 
Hopkins International for being early adopters of silent reading 
instruction as taught by The Reader’s Edge. I thank the thousands 
of individuals, schools, colleges, universities, and corporations in 
99 countries who now use The Reader’s Edge to learn efficient and 
effective speed-reading skills.
Finally, I want to thank Harvey Mackay, Tom Hopkins, Rogers 
Historical Museum, and StrugglingReaders.com for permitting me 
to use their columns and essays in this book as reading selections. 
I thank Evan Islam for his list of Fortune Cookies Sayings and 
Idiomsite.com and UsingEnglish.com for their list of idioms. I also 
thank Howard Bailey for permitting me to use the Recognition and 
Motility Eye exercises in this book.

Introduction
N
o matter how quickly or slowly you read now, you can read 
much more rapidly by adopting the speed-reading techniques 
described in this book. You can also comprehend, retain, and recall 
what you read much more successfully. You can become an efficient 
and effective reader, one who reads with confidence and greater 
understanding. You can read more in the time you devote to reading 
and get more from the articles and books you read.
This book represents all that I know and have discovered about 
speed reading during my 40 years as a speed-reading instructor and 
developer of speed-reading software. I have had the great pleasure 
of seeing my students’ reading speeds and comprehension improve 
dramatically, and I have also seen them derive greater pleasure from 
reading. These goals — increasing your reading speed and your 
pleasure from reading — are what this book is all about.
About This Book
The science (some would say art) of speed reading is about 100 
years old. Consequently, theories abound as to what makes a good 
speed reader and how to become a speed reader. This book takes 
a very basic approach to the subject — I believe speed reading is 
efficient reading. You don’t have to be a wizard or master arcane 
techniques to be a speed reader. All you have to do is understand 
the mechanics of reading and then apply yourself more efficiently 
to exercising those mechanics when you read. This book shows 
you how to do that. 
Speed Reading For Dummies is for people who have little or no 
background in speed reading, as well as for experienced speed 
readers who want to hone their speed-reading skills. It offers 
many strategies, tips, and tricks to improve your reading speed 
and includes numerous exercises to give you hands-on practice 
in speed-reading techniques. It also explains the how and why of 
speed-reading mechanics so that you understand not just what to 
do when you speed read but also why you do it.
A note about the exercises: If at first you don’t succeed, try again. 
Everyone grasps new material at a different rate — don’t get dis-
couraged if you don’t do as well as you expect the first time out of 
the gate. You can apply these exercises to just about any reading 

Speed Reading For Dummies

material to get additional practice; as I mention elsewhere in this 
book, newspapers are perfect for speed-reading practice, so con-
sider starting there.
You don’t have to read this book from start to finish — unless you 
want to, of course. I wrote and organized Speed Reading For Dummies 
so that you can start reading it anywhere you want. Consult the table 
of contents or “How This Book Is Organized” later in this introduction 
to find the speed-reading topic that interests you.
Conventions Used in This Book
To make this book easier to read, I’ve adopted these conventions:
 
✓ I italicize new terms in the text the first time I introduce 
them and then follow them closely with an easy-to-understand 
definition.
 
✓ Steps in the exercises are numbered and appear in boldface text. 
Follow the boldface instructions to complete the exercises.
 
✓ Web addresses appear in monofont.
 
✓ Though many use the term vocalization to mean “reading 
aloud,” for the purposes of this book I define vocalization as 
“speaking or hearing words as you read them.”
 
✓ Some exercises include long text pieces for you to practice on. 
I label these pieces to correspond with the exercise number 
(so Practice Text 7-1 goes with Exercise 7-1). For exercises 
that have multiple text pieces (such as those that ask you 
to read the same essay in different formats), I add a letter to 
each Practice Text heading (for example, Practice Text 2-1a 
and Practice Text 2-1b).
What You’re Not to Read
I’ve written this book so you can find the information you need 
easily and quickly. All the chapters provide you with important 
information, but the sidebars offer greater detail or tidbits of infor-
mation that you can skip if you like. I encourage you to read this 
information along with the regular text, but if you want to focus 
on the main points of the chapters, you can always come back to 
these shaded sections another time.

 Introduction

Foolish Assumptions
Forgive me, but I’ve made a few foolish assumptions about you, the 
reader of this book. I assume the following:
 
✓ You want to read anything and everything more quickly.
 
✓ You want to better comprehend and retain the books, articles, 
and Web pages you read every day.
 
✓ You feel overwhelmed by the amount of info you have to read 
for work or school and want a way to quickly and effectively 
get through all of it.
 
✓ You’ve heard a few tidbits about speed reading and are 
intrigued by the topic or wonder whether what you’ve heard 
is true.
 
✓ You want a plainspoken guide that trains you to speed read 
without a lot of fuss so you can quickly master speed-reading 
techniques.
How This Book Is Organized
Following is a short summary of each part of Speed Reading For 
Dummies. I invite you to use this summary as a quick guide to 
speed reading topics that interest you. Choose the speed-reading 
topic that interests you and have at it.
Part I: Introducing Speed Reading
Part I lays the groundwork for understanding what speed 
reading is and how you can read more efficiently. Chapter 1 
explains what happens in your brain and other parts of your 
anatomy when you speed read and the skills you need to be a 
speed reader. Chapter 2 delves into two bad habits — vocalizing 
and regressing — that keep you from reading quickly and then 
shows you how to break these habits. In Chapter 3, I look into 
eye fixations, vision span, and other reading mechanics to help 
you understand how to be a speed reader. Chapter 4 offers a 
number of speed reading exercises to give you a sense of the 
different skills you need to develop (and can develop with the 
exercises in Part II).

Speed Reading For Dummies

Part II: Focusing on the 
Fundamentals
Part II explores the core fundamentals of speed reading. First, 
Chapter 5 gives you an opportunity to take your first speed-reading 
tests so that you know where you stand. Then in Chapter 6 you 
take your first steps down the road to reading more than one word 
at a time as you discover how to widen your vision span vertically 
and horizontally when you read. Chapter 7 gives you practice 
in reading for units of meaning so that you read not only more 
than one word at a time but also one entire thought at a time and 
increase your comprehension, retention, and recall.
Part III: Advancing Your 
Speed-Reading Skills
Part III takes you to a higher speed-reading realm. To reinforce your 
speed-reading skills, Chapter 8 offers exercises that have you read 
text in ever wider columns so you can challenge your ability to read 
more words per eye fixation. Chapter 9 presents techniques to help 
you read aggressively with heightened concentration. In Chapter 10, 
you go above and beyond the normal speed-reading skills — this 
chapter explains how to skim, scan, and preread. Chapter 11 explains 
some refined speed-reading skills, including how to recognize the 
essence of a paragraph, follow the author’s thought patterns, and 
skip subordinate clauses in your reading.
Part IV: Improving Your 
Comprehension
Part IV looks at how to improve your comprehension, retention, and 
recall. Because having a large vocabulary is essential to being a speed 
reader, Chapter 12 shows how to expand your vocabulary. Chapter 13 
explores a potpourri of speed-reading tasks, including encouraging 
children to speed read; speed reading standardized tests, textbooks, 
and newspapers; and increasing your reading pleasure.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Each of the chapters in Part V offers advice for being a better speed 
reader. Chapter 14 offers quick tips for improving your speed read-
ing. Chapter 15 presents eye exercises for expanding your reading 
vision and seeing after your eye health, and Chapter 16 shows you 
how to make your speed reading skills permanent.

Part VI: Appendixes
You thought you were done, right? Not so fast — Part VI offers two 
appendixes. Appendix A lists the 2,000 most common words in the 
English language so you can be sure you know these all-important 
words. Appendix B provides a worksheet to help you track your 
progress on various exercises in this book.
Icons Used in This Book
To help you get the most out of this book, I’ve placed icons here 
and there. Here’s what the icons mean:
 
Next to the Tip icon, you find tricks of the trade designed to make

Introducing Speed 
Reading

In this part...
W
ith the idea that you should look before you leap, 
Part I provides a general introduction to speed 
reading. These chapters explain what goes on in your 
mind and body during the act of speed reading, what skills 
every speed reader needs, and which bad reading habits 
you need to break if you want to be a speed reader.
If you’re new to speed reading, I suggest reading all of Part I, 
especially Chapter 1, which describes the anatomy of read-
ing, and Chapter 2, which explains why vocalization is a 
hindrance to fast reading and how to break the vocalization 
habit. Chapter 3 shows how to expand your vision and take 
in several words at once in the act of reading. Visit Chapter 4 
to get a taste of the different skills you need to acquire to 
become a speed reader.

Chapter 1
Of Course You Can 
Speed Read!
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the act of reading
▶ Examining speed-reading myths
▶ Finding the right spot for successful speed reading
▶ Demonstrating to yourself that you can speed read
I
f you’re a typical reader, your reading education ended in the 
third grade, and you currently read using the same techniques 
you used as a third grader. You’re not reading as fast as you want 
because no one taught you the skills to read faster.
That’s the bad news.
The good news is that everybody can increase their reading speed 
by adopting a few simple techniques. Beyond those techniques, by 
being a committed reader, applying speed-reading principles, and 
reading with more concentration, you can read very quickly — 
perhaps doubling or even tripling your current reading speed. You 
can also read with better comprehension and retain and recall what 
you read. What’s more, you can get more pleasure and meaning 
from the books, articles, and Web pages you read.
This chapter introduces basic speed-reading concepts and demon-
strates why anyone can become a speed reader. At the end of the 
chapter, you can find an exercise that lets you put speed-reading 
skills to the test and see for yourself just how helpful a few tech-
niques can be.

What Is Speed Reading, Anyway?
When you read the words on the page of a book or newspaper 
article, what goes on in your head? Do you also hear the words as 
you read them? If you do, someone is speaking them, and unless a 
leprechaun is sitting on your shoulder, that someone is you.
Reading engages the eyes, ears, mouth, and, of course, the brain. 
Speed reading engages these senses even more than normal read-
ing because you use your senses and brain power even more 
efficiently. The following sections explain in detail what goes on in 
your eyes, ears, mouth, and brain when you speed read.
Speed reading is seeing
First and foremost, speed reading is seeing; the first step in read-
ing anything is seeing the words. But how do you see words on the 
page when you read?
Prior to 1920 or so, researchers and educators believed that 
people read one word at a time. To read, they thought, you moved 
your eyes left to right across the page, taking in one word after the 
other. Under this theory, fast readers were people who could iden-
tify and recognize the words faster.
However, all but beginning readers have the ability to see and read 
more than one word at a time. As you move your eyes left to right 
across the page, you jump ahead in fits and starts, taking in any-
where between one and five words at a time in quick glances.
These quick glances, when your eyes stop moving at different 
points in a sentence as you read it, are called eye fixations. I get 
into more detail on how eye fixations work in Chapter 3, but for 
now, the important points to know about speed reading are
 
✓ You read several words in a single glance. Unless you’re 
encountering words you don’t know or haven’t read before, 
you don’t read words one at a time.
 
✓ You expand your vision so that you can read and understand 
many words in a single glance. A very good speed reader can 
read, see, and process 10 to 14 words in a single eye fixation.
 
✓ You expand your vision to read vertically as well as horizon-
tally on the page. As well as taking in more than one word on a 
line of text, speed readers can also, in a single glance, read and 
understand words on two or three different lines. Check out 
Chapter 6 for more on expanding your reading vision, and head 
to Chapter 15 for some exercises that help you do just that.

 Chapter 1: Of Course You Can Speed Read! 11
Speed reading is silent reading
When you read, do you sometimes hear a faint whispering in your 
ear that belongs not to you, but to another person? Don’t fret, 
because you aren’t alone. Most people hear words when they read. 
The words speak to them from the page.
When you read, you speak words to yourself because you learned 
to read with the sound-it-out method. In school, your teacher told 
you that each letter makes a sound (sometimes more than one 
sound), that certain letter combinations also make sounds, and 
that you can always read a word by sounding out the letters and 
letter combinations:
su-per-cal-i-frag-il-ist-ic-ex-pi-al-i-do-cious
Your teacher was absolutely right. Being able to sound out words 
is an essential skill for beginning readers. Knowing the sounds 
each letter makes and knowing what sounds letter combinations 
make enables you to pronounce and read any word you encounter 
in your reading.
The problem with the sound-it-out approach to reading is that it 
slows you down. You read not at the speed you think but rather 
at the speed you talk. Sounding it out is fine for beginning readers, 
but at some point you have to dispense with sound if you want 
to be a speed reader. Saying the words, even if you only whisper 
them inside the confines of your skull, takes time.
In speed-reading terminology, saying and hearing words as you 
read them is called vocalizing (Chapter 2 gives you the lowdown 
on vocalizing and how to stop it). For now you need to remember 
that
 
✓ Vocalizing is a throwback to your early reading education; 
you must abandon it to be a speed reader.
 
✓ Training yourself not to vocalize when you read is one of the 
most important speed-reading skills you can acquire.
Speed reading is decoding the words
When you come across a word in your reading that you don’t know 
or recognize, you have to decode it. You break it into syllables, try 
to pronounce it, and see whether it’s related to words you know. 
You try to get its meaning, and if you can’t do that on your own, 
you consult a dictionary or other reference source.

Part I: Introducing Speed Reading 
12
Beginning readers have to decode most of the words they encounter. 
But the more you read, the fewer words you have to decode because 
reading enlarges your vocabulary. It introduces you to more words.
Chapter 12 explains how to enlarge your vocabulary. For now, all 
you need to know about speed reading is
 
✓ The larger your vocabulary is, the faster you can read, 
because you don’t have to slow down or halt your reading as 
often to decode words you don’t know.
 
✓ If you want to be a speed reader, you have to develop your 
vocabulary.
Speed reading is comprehending
The purpose of reading is to comprehend — to learn something 
new, see the world from a different perspective, or maybe just get 
information to pass an exam or prepare for a business meeting.
How well you comprehend what you read is determined by these 
factors:
 
✓ Reading speed: When you don’t read at the right speed, your 
comprehension is diminished. One of the skills you acquire as a 
speed reader is knowing when to slow down and when to speed 
up. The fastest speed readers adjust the speed at which they 
read, just as the fastest stock car racers slow down when they’re 
in a crowded field or on a slick patch of roadway. They adjust 
their speed according to the type of reading they’re doing.
 
✓ Breadth of vocabulary: Having a large vocabulary is a must 
for speed readers. You can’t get away from it.
 
✓ Degree of familiarity with the subject matter: How strong a 
background you have in the topic you’re reading about deter-
mines how well you comprehend what you read. Obviously, 
you have a head start if you’re traveling in territory you’re 
familiar with and you know the jargon already.
Though many chapters in this book deal with comprehension in 
some aspect, Part IV (Chapters 12 and 13) deals specifically with 
improving your comprehension as you speed read. At this point, 
what you need to know about speed reading is that
 
✓ Speed reading actually increases reading comprehension. 
Because you read several words at a time when you speed 
read, you can pick up the meaning of words in context. This 

 Chapter 1: Of Course You Can Speed Read! 13
ability to read in context improves comprehension because 
each word in the sentence gives meaning to the other words 
instead of standing alone.
 
✓ Speed reading has a snowball effect on the size of your 
vocabulary and general knowledge, which increases your 
reading speed. The more you read, the larger your vocabu-
lary and breadth of knowledge become; the larger they 
become, the more easily you read, which encourages you to 
read more and broaden your vocabulary and knowledge.
 
✓ You can adopt many strategies for improving your compre-
hension when you read. For example, you can train yourself 
to pinpoint the most important parts of an essay and read 
them more carefully. You can even focus on the most impor-
tant parts of a sentence as you read them. In Chapter 13, I 
describe strategies for reading efficiently to complete various 
kinds of tasks.
Speed reading is concentrating
All reading requires concentration; even reading a third-rate 
thriller on the beach on a beautiful sunny day requires a certain 
amount of concentration. If only for a moment, you have to ignore 
the refreshing breeze, as enticing as it feels, to find out whether 
the hero will escape from the villain’s secret mountaintop retreat.
Speed reading, however, requires sustained, forceful concentra-
tion because when you speed read, you do many things at once. As 
you see and read the words on the page, you also remain alert to 
the main ideas that the author wants to present. You have to think 
along with the author and detect how she presents the material so 
you can pin down the main ideas. As you read, you have to read 
with more perspective and separate the details from weightier 
stuff. You have to know when to skim, when to read fast, and when 
to slow down to get the gist of it. (Chapter 10 helps you choose 
your reading speed.)
Speed reading also requires you to read aggressively. You read 
hungrily, absorbing the information as you come to it.
 
One way to improve your concentration when you speed read is 
to imagine that nothing exists outside the boundaries of the page 
you’re reading (or the boundaries of the monitor, if you’re read-
ing at your computer). Pretend that the entire universe has been 
condensed to the square space in front of your nose. Nothing can 
distract you because nothing exists to distract you.

Debunking Speed-Reading Myths
The previous section explains what reading, and speed reading in 
particular, is. This section explains what speed reading isn’t. These 
myths about speed reading are false:
 
✓ You don’t enjoy reading as much when you speed read. On 
the contrary! Speed reading is efficient reading, as I explain 
in “What Is Speed Reading, Anyway?” earlier in this chapter. 
When you speed read, you’re a better reader — you get more 
pleasure and meaning out of the books, articles, and Web 
pages that you read. In my years as a speed-reading teacher, 
I have seen countless individuals grow to love reading after 
they learned how to speed read.
 
✓ You don’t comprehend as well when you speed read. Speed 
reading is the act of reading with higher levels of concentration. 
What’s more, by reading several words at a time rather than 
one word after the other, your comprehension increases. You 
can read words in context and derive more meaning from the 
words you read. Check out “Speed reading is comprehending” 
earlier in this chapter for more on why this myth is a sham.
 
✓ You skip words when you speed read. Wrong again. Speed 
readers don’t fixate their eyes on all the words as they read, 
but that doesn’t mean they skip the words. Speed reading 
entails reading words in clumps, or groups. You read more 
than one word at a time, but no word gets skipped. (Head to 
Chapter 6 for more on reading word clumps.)
 
✓ You have to run your finger down the page or use a pacer 
when you speed read. A pacer is a visual guide, such as your 
finger or a pen, that marks where you read on the page; I’ve 
included three of them on the Cheat Sheet at the front of this 
book. Most people have a stereotypical image of a speed reader 
as a crazed-looking individual dragging her finger or a pacer 
quickly down the page in the act of reading. However, you don’t 
need a pacer to speed read. As I explain in Chapter 3, a pacer 
can be helpful in the early stages of speed reading, but you’re 
wise to abandon it after you get the hang of speed reading.
What You Need to Get Started
Besides the ability to concentrate, you don’t need very much to 
speed read.

 Chapter 1: Of Course You Can Speed Read! 15
If you’re reading a book, magazine, newspaper, or the like, you 
need a quiet, well-lit place free from noise and other distractions. 
Make wherever you can concentrate best the place you go when 
you want to speed read.
You may also use a pacer when you read. (Chapter 3 discusses pacers 
in detail.) A pacer is a reading aid such as a card or your hand that 
directs you where to look on the page when you read. The Cheat 
Sheet at the front of this book has three pacers in case you want to 
use one. In the exercises, I sometimes call on you to use a pacer; 
choose whichever Cheat Sheet pacer is most comfortable for you.
Some of the exercises in this book call for you to time your reading 
speed. If you have a stopwatch you can use to time yourself, great. 
If not, you need a clock or watch with a second hand so you can 
time yourself down to the second.
 
Don’t look at your clock or watch while you do the exercises! You 
may distract yourself from getting the highest possible score.
You also need a good pair of eyes, and barring that, a good pair of 
glasses. How’s your eyesight? No matter how good or poor it is, 
flip to Chapter 15 for some eye exercises that improve the health 
of your eyes and Chapter 16 for more info on the importance of 
good eye health.
 
When you speed read, you should be comfortable, but not too 
comfortable. For example, a hammock isn’t a good location for 
speed reading. Hammocks induce sleep, not higher levels of con-
centration.
More than ever, people do their reading on computer monitors, 
not the pages of books, newspapers, or magazines. You can do a 
handful of things to make computer reading more comfortable and 
less of a strain on your eyes. Check out Chapter 13 for advice.
Proving You Can Read Faster
In “What Is Speed Reading, Anyway?” earlier in this chapter, I 
explain both the disadvantages of vocalizing and the benefits of 
using eye fixations as you read. Exercise 1-1 demonstrates these 
points. In this exercise, you read a short essay called “The Need 
to Revise the Nation’s Reading Curriculum” twice. You read it first 
without the benefits of the speed-reading principles I cover in this 
chapter, and then you put on your speed-reading cap and read the 
essay again, using basic speed-reading techniques. At the end of 
the exercise, you compare reading times.

Part I: Introducing Speed Reading 
16
Follow these steps to complete the first half of the exercise:
 
1. Take note of the time you start reading.
 
2. Read the following presentation of “The Need to Revise 
the Nation’s Reading Curriculum” (Practice Text 1-1a) 
out loud.
 
 That’s right — say every single word, pronouncing each 
word carefully and correctly. Speak loud enough to make 
the dog or cat (if one is in the room) prick up his ears. 
Reading aloud like this requires you to read one word 
at a time, which is what happens when you vocalize.
 
3. When you finish reading, write down how long it took to 
read the essay on the worksheet in Appendix B.

The Need to Revise the Nation’s Reading Curriculum
by Richard Sutz
Call to action: To revise the nation’s reading curriculum 
in order to create a more literate society where the 
potential and productivity of the citizenry is not limited 
or constrained by ineffective, slow reading. This revision 
is needed because formal reading education, the learn-to-
read stage, officially stops after third grade, at which time 
children have learned:
 
• Only to read one word at a time, out loud — what we call 
“oral reading fluency.”
 
• None of the necessary read-to-learn skills — what we call 
“silent reading fluency.”
We propose four revisions to the nation’s reading curriculum 
that incorporate teaching children the silent reading skills 
necessary to become effective and efficient readers. To 
achieve silent reading fluency, children must be taught 
to see, read, and process groups of words or units of 
meaning with each eye fixation, without vocalizing (lip 
or subliminally).
 
1. REVISE the No Child Left Behind Act goals to redefine 
oral reading fluency as the interim goal, and incorpo-
rate silent reading fluency as the new end-goal.
 
2. TRAIN educators to teach silent reading skills to 
children before, during, and after third grade.

 Chapter 1: Of Course You Can Speed Read! 17
Practice Text 1-1a (continued)
 
3. REQUIRE mastery of prime words (approximately 
75 percent of all words found in print). This will 
dramatically facilitate reading groups of words 
automatically, with improved comprehension, 
while reading silently.
 
4. ASSESS reading improvement in standardized testing 
related to the teaching of silent reading skills.
These revisions will guarantee successful teaching, learning, 
and mastery of silent reading skills — skills that are required 
in today’s information-based society where all reading is silent 
and individuals are judged on their ability to read to learn.
About USA’s Current Reading Curriculum — The Good Side: No 
Child Left Behind set a standard and timeline by which all of the 
nation’s children will demonstrate that they have learned to read 
by the end of third grade. The benefits of early reading education 
are indisputable. Children who are literate (who can read and 
enjoy reading) are better equipped to avoid drugs, teen suicide, 
and dropping out of high school, and 90 percent of learning is 
based on reading. Children who cannot read by the end of third 
grade are far more likely to be school dropouts, experience teen-
age pregnancy, rely on state social services as adults, and be 
forced into low-skill, low-wage jobs throughout their lives.
About USA’s Current Reading Curriculum — The Bad Side: 
Children are not explicitly taught effective and efficient fluent 
silent reading skills. Why? Because formal reading education 
stops immediately after oral reading skills are mastered. Hence, 
fourth graders, armed only with oral reading skills (the exact 
opposite of silent reading skills) enter the silent reading world 
unprepared to read to learn. They are condemned to become 
slow readers. As a result:
 
• Students in the fourth grade will continue to experience 
the well-known “fourth grade slump” — universally 
understood to be caused by poor reading skills.
 
• Poor readers in elementary school will continue to 
become poorer readers in high school and enter adult-
hood lacking minimal levels of reading skills necessary 
to achieve successful lives and careers.
 
• Our nation will continue to create poor readers with all the 
negative issues associated with a citizenry unable to read 
efficiently. (Arizona and other states utilize fourth grade 
reading assessment results as one basis for long-term pro-
jections of how many prison beds will be required.)

Why Does Formal Reading Education Stop after Third Grade? 
Because the “end goal” of the current reading curriculum, 
per No Child Left Behind, is to have children read at the third 
grade level by the end of third grade, producing children who 
are only skilled as fluent oral readers. Federal funding support-
ing reading-to-learn education is drastically reduced after third 
grade; hence, silent reading skills are not taught.
The Solution: Oral reading fluency should be redefined as the 
No Child Left Behind Act’s interim-goal of reading education. 
The Act’s end-goal should now be defined as requiring stu-
dents to demonstrate mastery of silent reading skills — seeing, 
reading, and processing more than one word at a time without 
vocalizing (lip or subliminally).
Technology to Accomplish the Solution: Our company utilizes 
scientifically sound principles to dramatically teach how to 
unlearn the habits of slow readers (oral readers) and learn 
the habits and skills used by fluent readers (silent readers). 
Mastering silent reading skills arms children, as well as adults, 
with skills needed in the real world, where all reading is done 
silently.
How Long Does It Take to Learn Silent Reading Skills? Our com-
pany guarantees that individuals of any age can double their 
reading speed with increased comprehension and recall by 
spending a minimum of 15 minutes every other day for three 
weeks with our software. Greater improvement will come with 
additional practice.
When you read the selection a second time, take to heart these 
speed-reading basics:
 
✓ Read aggressively. Part of being a speed reader is reading with 
more intensity, focus, and concentration. This time, devour the 
words as you read them. Be an active, not a passive, reader.
 
✓ Don’t vocalize. As best you can, glance at the words and take 
in their meaning without hearing them. (Chapter 2 offers tech-
niques to keep from vocalizing.)
 
✓ Widen your vision. Instead of focusing on a word at a time, 
focus on four, seven, or ten words. Trust yourself to be able 
to see the most relevant words at a glance and fill in the rest.
Follow these steps to complete the second half of Exercise 1-1:
 
1. Take note of the time you start reading the second pre-
sentation of “The Need to Revise the Nation’s Reading 
Curriculum” (Practice Text 1-1b).

 Chapter 1: Of Course You Can Speed Read! 19
 
2. Read the following presentation of the essay silently; try 
to resist the urge to vocalize.
 
 Notice how this second presentation is divided into one- to 
five-word clumps. You’re now reading the essay as a speed 
reader would read it. You aren’t vocalizing, and you’re 
reading several words at a time. Notice how much faster 
you read.
 
3. When you finish reading the second presentation of 
the essay, write down how long you took to read it in 
Appendix B and compare your first reading time to your 
second reading time.

If I was a betting man, I’d bet the farm that you read the second 
presentation faster than the first. Just by reading more aggres-
sively, being careful not to vocalize, and seeing more than one 
word at a time, you can be a much better reader. The rest of this 
book gives you many strategies for reading faster, but it all boils 
down to aggressiveness, silent reading, and better vision.

Chapter 2
It’s All about Breaking 
Bad Reading Habits
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering what vocalization is
▶ Stopping the vocalization habit
▶ Keeping yourself from regressing
H
alf of becoming a speed reader is developing new skills; the 
other half is breaking the bad habits that keep you from 
reading faster.
This chapter looks at the bad habits side of speed reading. It 
examines vocalization and explains how you can drop the habit of 
saying and hearing words as you read. It also explains why some 
people regress — why they’re in the habit of rereading — and how 
you can dump this habit if you have it.
Understanding Vocalization 
and Its Effects
Reading educators use the term vocalization to describe readers 
who hear words when they read. Vocalizers are readers who read 
with their mouths — they say and hear the words as they read. 
Vocalizing slows your reading down considerably and is a habit 
you should break if you intend to become a speed reader.
In the following sections, you find out what causes vocalization 
and how to determine whether you vocalize when you read.

Part I: Introducing Speed Reading 
24
Finding out why vocalizing 
slows you down
Silently read the following nursery rhyme. As you read, note 
whether you hear the words in spite of your reading them silently:
Hickory dickory dock
The mouse ran up the clock
The clock struck one
The mouse ran down
Hickory dickory dock
I chose this nursery rhyme because it includes several loud, hard 
consonants (ks and ds) that test your ability to read without hear-
ing the words. Did you hear the ks, ds, and other sounds? If your 
answer is no, you’re probably not being entirely truthful. Even fast 
readers vocalize a little bit.
Vocalizing as little as possible is an essential goal of speed reading. 
Vocalizing hinders your reading for these reasons:
 
✓ It slows down your reading. The average person speaks 
at 150 to 200 words per minute. If you vocalize all words as 
you read, you can’t read faster than this rate because you 
have to read the words at the rate you speak them. By con-
trast, advanced readers read at 200 to 400 words per minute, 
and speed readers read above 400 words or more per minute.
 
✓ It affects comprehension. If you move your lips or mimic 
speech when you read, you engage a part of your mind in 
speech activities when you really ought to devote it to grasp-
ing the author’s ideas.
 
✓ It hinders your ability to comprehend through context 
clues. For example, the first two words of this sentence make 
no sense until you read the complete sentence: “Sénéchal, 
bailli — the knight aspired to one of these positions in the 
royal administration.” Readers who vocalize are baffled by the 
first two words of this sentence and are slow to comprehend 
them, but fast readers who don’t vocalize can read the entire 
sentence in one or two glances, and they know immediately 
that the words sénéchal and bailli refer to administrative posi-
tions appointed by the king.

 Chapter 2: It’s All about Breaking Bad Reading Habits 25
 
✓ It causes regression. As I explain later in this chapter, regres-
sion occurs when you’re unsure of what you read and you 
move your eyes backward over words and sentences you 
have read already to confirm their meaning. Vocalizing causes 
regression because your eyes race ahead of your mouth in the 
act of reading, and your mouth reads one place while your eyes 
read another. This gap between what the mouth says and what 
the eyes see creates confusion and causes you to regress.
Finding out how (and how much) 
you vocalize
How you break the vocalization habit depends on how much you 
vocalize when you read. Try the following test to determine how 
much you vocalize.
Taking the vocalization test
Read this paragraph to yourself, not aloud. As you read, listen with 
your ears and also be aware of any movement or feeling in your 
lips, tongue, vocal cords, larynx (voice box), and throat.
Did you hear the lark singing in the square? I heard it. In fact, 
it woke me up. Why that little bird chooses to sing at night is 
a mystery. The lark sings in my dreams and sings when I’m 
awake. You can’t stop that bird from singing!
Tracing the causes of vocalization
It’s hard not to vocalize when you read because written language is in fact a vocal-
ization tool. The ancient Anglo-Saxons and Normans who invented the English lan-
guage didn’t have recording devices, MP3 players, or digital playback machines. To 
carry speech over distances longer than they could shout, they invented a system 
of stringing together letters and words to form speech. When you read, you almost 
can’t help speaking the words because written English was designed to convey the 
sound of words on paper or parchment.
You also vocalize when you read, if you had a typical reading education, because 
you learned to read by vocalizing. Vocalizing is a legacy of the sound-it-out reading 
education you received in elementary school. You were taught oral reading skills — 
that letters and letter combinations make certain sounds and that you should speak 
these sounds as you read.
These skills are fine for beginning readers because they help beginners decode 
and pronounce words they see on the page. But to be a speed reader you must drop 
the oral reading skills you were taught and embrace silent reading skills.

Part I: Introducing Speed Reading 
26
Did you detect any movement or feeling in your vocal apparatus 
when you read this paragraph? Did you hear the words? The 
degree to which you heard the words or felt movement in your lips 
and tongue determines how much you vocalize.
Determining what type of reader you are
Reading educators distinguish between three types of vocalization. 
In order from most to least vocal, they are motor readers, auditory 
readers, and visual readers. Use the results of the vocalization test 
you took in the previous section to identify your reading type:
 
✓ Motor reader: These readers tend to move their lips and may 
even mimic speech with their tongues and vocal cords when 
reading. Their reading range is very slow (150 to 200 words 
per minute) because they must read word-by-word at the rate 
they speak. These readers have poor comprehension due to 
their slow reading speed.
 
✓ Auditory reader: These readers don’t engage their lips, tongue, 
or vocal cords when they read, but they do silently say and 
hear the words. They read in the 200 to 400 words-per-minute 
range. Auditory readers are skillful readers with vocabularies 
large enough that they can quickly recognize words.
 
✓ Visual reader: These readers vocalize minimally or not at all. 
Visual readers engage their eyes and minds when they read, 
but not their mouths, throats, or ears. They can read many 
words at once because they read ideas, not individual words. 
They read at a rate of 400+ words per minute.
To be a speed reader, you must endeavor to be a visual reader.
Getting Away from Vocalization
Stopping yourself from vocalizing is an essential first step to 
becoming a speed reader. Vocalizing keeps you from reading 
thought unit by thought unit across the page.
If you’re an auditory reader, breaking the vocalization habit is 
a matter of perseverance. If you’re a motor reader, you have 
some more work to do to break the vocalization habit. Never 
fear, because the following sections give you tips for kicking 
vocalization to the curb, as well as an exercise to practice your 
newfound techniques.

 Chapter 2: It’s All about Breaking Bad Reading Habits 27
Reading for meaning 
rather than sound
Reading without vocalizing has a lot in common with listening to 
someone speak. Imagine you’re listening to a friend describe a trip 
to Mexico. Do you hear your friend’s words, or do you hear her 
descriptions, thoughts, and ideas?
When someone speaks, you hear the words, but you only hear them 
in connection with whatever thoughts and ideas the speaker is trying 
to convey. The same is true of reading without vocalizing: You read 
words for meaning, not sound, much as you do when listening to 
someone speak. You see the word on the page and respond to its 
meaning without the intermediary step of hearing the word’s sound. 
You don’t read the words as words — you read units of meaning (like 
ideas, thoughts, and descriptions) whose building blocks happen to 
be words. (Head to Chapter 7 for more on units of meaning.)
Look at it this way: When you read a single word — generous, for 
example — you don’t read it syllable by syllable: gen-er-ous. You 
glance at the word — generous — and instantly understand its 
meaning. Likewise when you read without vocalizing, you don’t 
read word by word:
He — was — generous — to — a — fault.
You read thought unit by thought unit:
He was generous — to a fault.
This is exactly what happens when you listen to someone speak — 
you respond to thought units, not individual words.
Stopping the vocalization motor
To prevent your lips from moving when you read and disengage 
your vocal system, try putting your mouth to work at something 
besides reading. Chew gum, or, if your lip movements are especially 
pronounced, place a pencil or pen between your lips as you read.
 
Don’t be discouraged if you have trouble understanding the words 
and moving from word to word on the page when you first try one of 
these techniques. You will be extremely uncomfortable the first few 
times you read with gum in your mouth or a pencil or pen between 
your lips. Stay with it. Most motor readers who try these strategies 
quickly lose the habit of moving their lips while they read.

Part I: Introducing Speed Reading 
28
Silencing your inner reading voice
Here are some techniques for training yourself to read without 
hearing your inner reading voice:
 
✓ Try to perceive the words rather than see them. Imagine that 
each word is a symbol (not a sound) that conveys a meaning.
 
✓ Turn off your ears. Pretend your ears have a volume control 
and turn it to the mute setting.
 
✓ Widen your field of vision. By taking in more words on a 
line, you force yourself to read more words at a time, and this 
helps prevent vocalization. Chapter 6 looks at widening your 
field of vision.
 
✓ Identify the thought units in sentences, not the words, and 
read thought unit by thought unit rather than word by word. 
Chapter 7 delves into recognizing and utilizing thought units.
 
✓ Concentrate harder when you read. Much of being a speed 
reader comes down to concentrating harder than you used to.
Exercising to quiet your inner reader
Exercise 2-1 lets you practice breaking the vocalization habit. You 
read the essay “The Revolutionary War” twice. First you read as 
you normally do, and then you read without vocalizing.
Follow these steps to complete the first half of Exercise 2-1.
 
1. Note the time you start reading.
 
2. Read the first presentation of “The Revolutionary War” 
(Practice Text 2-1a).
 
 In this reading, don’t try to silence or mute your inner read-
ing voice. Read as you normally do.
 
3. After you finish reading, record your reading time on the 
worksheet in Appendix B.

The Revolutionary War

The Revolutionary War was America’s struggle for indepen-
dence from England.
The dictionary defines revolution as “complete change.” A 
revolution is an uprising by the people. It attempts to destroy 

 Chapter 2: It’s All about Breaking Bad Reading Habits 29
the social or political system of a country. Then it replaces 
the system with a new system, often by war and bloodshed. 
Revolutions happen when people in a country are suffering a 
hardship or want changes to be made.
One of the most famous revolutions in history occurred in 
America in 1776. The American colonies broke away from 
Great Britain and became an independent republic. (Colonies 
are areas of land under the control of another country.) The 
Revolutionary War, or the American Revolution, was fought 
between Great Britain and its thirteen colonies that lay along 
the Atlantic Ocean in North America.
Tensions between Great Britain and the American colonies had 
been building for more than ten years before the Revolutionary 
War began. Great Britain and the American colonies disagreed 
about a number of things, especially laws, taxes, and trade 
regulations.
However, the Americans had become used to self rule, and 
they strongly resisted the new laws, especially tax laws. These 
laws forced them to pay money to Great Britain but wouldn’t 
allow them any representation in the British Parliament. The 
Parliament is the main law-making body, made up of the King or 
Queen, the Lord, and the elected representatives of the people. 
The colonies insisted upon “no taxation without representa-
tion.” Citizens of Massachusetts were used to a representative 
form of government and town meetings. They believed they 
had a right to participate in government and should not be 
taxed unless represented in government.
American colonists also objected to paying taxes on British 
imports, goods brought in from Britain. The colonies reacted 
to the British taxes by banning all British imports. In what was 
known as the Boston Tea Party, the colonists boarded three 
British tea ships in Boston Harbor on December 16, 1773. They 
threw the cargoes overboard, fifteen thousand pounds of tea 
into the Boston Harbor. 
The Patriots, a group of Americans who loved, defended, and 
supported their country, fired the first shots of the war on 
April 19, 1775, at Lexington, Massachusetts, and at nearby 
Concord. Initially the war went badly for the Americans, who 
were unprepared for war. The British had superior weapons 
and a professional military. However, the British being far from 
home, transporting weapons and men was difficult.

The colonial militias (a body of men not belonging to a regu-
lar army, but trained as soldiers to serve only in their home 
country) made up mostly of farmers won many encounters. 
But compared with the British soldiers, they were poorly 
trained. It was only after General Washington took charge of 
the Continental Army and began training the soldiers that the 
rebelling forces won major battles and eventually the war. 
On September 3, 1783, eight years after the war began, the 
colonies declared their victory, and Great Britain signed the 
Treaty of Paris. The important document stated that the 
American colonies were no longer under British rule. The colo-
nies had won their independence from Great Britain. They had 
become a new nation, the United States of America. 
The Revolutionary War became a symbol for a new way of 
thinking. It was a legendary example to people in other lands 
who later fought to gain their freedom. American author Ralph 
Waldo Emerson referred to the first shot fired by the Patriots 
at Concord as “the shot heard around the world.”
The American Revolution was the first time in history that a 
people fought for their independence based on principles such 
as rule of law, constitutional rights, and popular sovereignty, 
authority belonging to the people.
Follow these steps to complete the second half of Exercise 2-1:
 
1. Note the time you start reading the second presentation 
of “The Revolutionary War” (Practice Text 2-1b).
 
2. Read the second presentation, as much as you’re able, 
without hearing your inner reading voice.
 
 For this presentation of the essay, to help keep you from 
vocalizing, I have divided the words into thought units and 
units of meaning. Reading the words without vocalizing at 
all is impossible, but do your best to suppress your inner 
reading voice.
 
3. After you finish reading the second presentation of the 
essay, write down how long it took you to read it in 
Appendix B, and compare your first reading time to your 
second reading time to determine which presentation 
you read faster.

You probably read the second presentation faster. By quieting

can really pick up your reading speed.
Preventing Regression 
When You Read
Reading educators use the term regression to describe the act of 
moving your eyes backward to reread words and sentences you’ve 
already read. You regress if you lose confidence in understanding 
what you’ve read and believe you have to go back.
Sometimes regressing is necessary. If you’re reading a dry tech-
nical manual or academic paper, you can’t help but regress (or 
yawn) from time to time. Sometimes regressing is the author’s 
fault. Reading is a collaboration between the author and reader, 
but if the author doesn’t live up to his side of the bargain (if he 
writes badly), you have to regress to material you’ve already read 
to figure out what the heck is going on.
Obviously, regression slows your reading speed. It takes twice 
as long to turn back and read what you’ve already read. Worse, 
regression also slows comprehension because you lose the flow 
of meaning in the words. For example, consider these two para-
graphs. In the first, you read without regressing. The second para-
graph demonstrates what readers read when they regress:
The steeplechase is a kind of distance horse race in which 
horse and rider jump fences, jump ditches, and face other 
obstacles. The races originated in Ireland in the 18th century. 
The race gets its name because originally the contestants 
raced from the church steeple in one town to the church stee-
ple in another.

The steeplechase is a kind of distance horse race in which 
horse and — distance horse race — rider jump fences, jump 
ditches, and face other obstacles — jump fences, jump ditches. 
The races originated in Ireland in the 18th century. The race 
gets its name — 18th century — because originally the contes-
tants raced — gets its name — from the church steeple in one 
town to the church steeple in another.
The second paragraph is a jumbled mess, but it’s what readers see 
when they regress in the course of reading. It’s what they compre-
hend, too, if they comprehend anything at all.
If you compulsively regress in your reading, you can do something 
about it. Resist the urge to regress by forcing yourself to do the 
opposite of what it tells you to do. Forge ahead in your reading. 
Eventually, you lose the compulsion to regress and start to under-
stand that regressing isn’t as necessary as you thought it was for 
understanding what you read.
 
If regressing is an especially thorny problem for you, try this tech-
nique to keep yourself from regressing. Get an index card or fold a 
piece of paper that’s as long as the line of text you’re reading. As 
you finish reading each line, cover it with the card or paper. This 
way, you can’t see earlier lines and you can’t regress.
But I regress. . .
Here are some other reasons readers regress:
 ✓ They vocalize. As I explain earlier in this chapter, vocalization occurs when you 
hear the words as you read them. When you vocalize, your eyes race ahead of 
your mouth as you read, and you get confused when the disparity between what 
your inner reading voice says and what your eyes see becomes too great. You 
have to return to material you already read to make sure you read it correctly.
 ✓ They’re compelled to. Some people regress for the same reason that they 
double- and triple-check to make sure their car keys are in their pocket or 
purse — they’re compulsive about it. They don’t trust their ability to understand 
what they read, so they reread material again and again.
 ✓ They believe the slower-is-better myth. Some people regress because they 
believe in the myth that the only way to get good comprehension is to read 
slowly, purposefully, and repetitively. As I argue in Chapter 1 of this book, speed 
reading actually increases comprehension.

W
ith the goal of improving your speed-reading mechanics 
so that you can apply them to the speed-reading skills in 
Chapter 4, this chapter explains what happens in your eyes and 
mind when you speed read. It explains what eye fixations are, what 
your vision span is, and how you can increase your reading speed 
by widening your reading vision. This chapter also looks into how 
you comprehend when you read and how to choose reading strate-
gies when you begin reading a new book, article, or Web page.
Fixating on Eye Fixations
For your eyes to see anything, they have to be still. You can’t swing 
your eyes wildly around the room and expect to see anything but 
a blur. To see anything clearly — your fingernail, a bug on the 
window sill, the neighbor’s yard, the highest peak on the horizon, 
a star in the sky — your eyes must be still.
The same is true of reading words on a page. To see words, your 
eyes must be still, but they must also move left-to-right across the 
page to take in words in the act of reading.

Part I: Introducing Speed Reading 
36
How can your eyes be still and move at the same time? The answer 
is eye fixations. When you read, your eyes move in fits and starts 
across the page. They fixate on an individual word or a group of 
words and then move along to the next word or word group when 
you have comprehended the first one. In this way, you read across 
each line of text.
Looking at eye fixations
For many years, researchers took for granted the idea that every-
body reads one word at a time. They believed that fast readers 
were simply people who could identify and comprehend individual 
words quickly, one after the next.
Starting about 1910, however, researchers interested in improving 
students’ reading abilities conducted experiments to see precisely 
what happens when you read. They discovered eye fixations. They 
noticed that the eyes do not move at a steady rate across the 
page but rather by fits and starts. They also discovered that 
the fewer eye fixations you have when reading, the faster you 
read. This breakthrough discovery was the beginning of modern 
speed reading.
Figure 3-1 demonstrates a single eye fixation. The eyes are focused 
on the fixation point, but they can see letters and words to the left 
and right of this point in the vision span. In the figure, the reader 
is reading three words — “in temperate regions” — in a single eye 
fixation.
The willow grows in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere

 Chapter 3: Understanding the Mechanics of Speed Reading 37
You can conduct your own experiment to see how eye fixations 
work by following these steps:
 
1. Recruit a friend who doesn’t mind letting you watch him 
or her read.
 
 If a friend isn’t handy, put on a pair of dark glasses and go 
to a public place such as a library or waiting room where a 
number of people are reading.
 
2. Give your friend a book or magazine article to read and 
observe his or her eyes in the act of reading.
 
 If you’re watching a stranger read, be discreet. Make sure 
your dark glasses are riding high on your nose; better yet, 
put on a pair of Groucho glasses.
 
3. Notice how the reader’s eyes move.
 
 They remain for a fraction of a second in one place and 
then jerk to the right, where they remain for another frac-
tion of a second and jerk to the right again. What you see 
are eye fixations. After arriving at the end of the line, the 
eyes sweep to the left and fixate on a position at the start 
of the next line, and the eye fixations begin anew.
 
4. To count how many eye fixations occur on a line, ask the 
reader to tell you when he or she comes to the end of 
each line. You better skip this step if you’re watching a 
stranger read.)
 
 Some lines of text require more eye fixations to read than 
others, depending on a number of factors including how 
long the line is, how familiar the reader is with the topic, 
and whether the words in the line are in the reader’s 
vocabulary.
As well as seeing the subject’s eyes jerk to the right, you may 
see them jerk to the left. Eyes fixate right to left when the reader 
regresses in the act of reading. As Chapter 2 explains, regression 
occurs when you move backward to reread text and make sure you 
understood it correctly.
Eye fixations and reading speed
Readers who make fewer eye fixations read faster because they 
take in more words with each fixation. Instead of taking in 1 or 2 
words at a time, fast readers can see and process 3 to 14 words in 
a single eye fixation.

Part I: Introducing Speed Reading 
38
The number of words you can process in an eye fixation depends 
on your vision span, your vocabulary, and your familiarity with 
what you’re reading, which I cover in the following sections.
Eye fixations and your vision span
The wider your vision span is, the more words you can process in 
an eye fixation and the faster you can read. Acquiring the ability 
to see many words at a time is essential for speed reading. To see 
why, consider this sentence:
The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain.
A slow reader with a narrow vision span reads this sentence slowly 
in six to nine eye fixations, sometimes taking in only a single word 
per fixation. This reader has to work harder to comprehend the 
sentence because the meaning of the words arrives disconnectedly 
in short bursts. In the following version of the sentence, I inserted 
slashes to represent where a slow reader would fixate her eyes in 
the course of reading:
The rain \ in Spain \ falls \ mainly \ on \ the plain.
A fast reader with a wider vision span can read the sentence in 
two or three eye fixations. This reader has a stronger comprehen-
sion because she reads the sentence phrase by phrase (or thought 
unit by thought unit — more on this terminology in Chapter 7), 
and phrases convey more meaning than individual words. In this 
version of the sentence, I added slashes to represent where a fast 
reader would fixate his or her eyes in the course of reading. The 
fast reader reads the sentence in only two eye fixations:
The rain in Spain falls \ mainly on the plain.
Eye fixations and your vocabulary
To see how eye fixations correlate to vocabulary, read these lines 
carefully and try to understand their meaning:
Sownynge in moral vertu was his speche,
And gladly wolde he lerne, and gladly teche.
Unless you understand Middle English or you’re familiar with 
the writings of Geoffrey Chaucer (these lines come from The 
Canterbury Tales), you had trouble with these lines because few of 

 Chapter 3: Understanding the Mechanics of Speed Reading 39
the words are in your vocabulary. You didn’t recognize the words, 
so you had to examine them one at a time and probably read the 
lines in 15 (or more) eye fixations, one for each word.
Reading this translation of Chaucer’s lines is considerably easier 
because all or most of the words are in your vocabulary. Notice 
how much faster you read the translation:
Filled with moral virtue was his speech,
And gladly would he learn, and gladly teach.
You read the translation faster because you needed fewer eye fixa-
tions to read it. You probably read the translation in eight or fewer 
fixations. Because the words were familiar, you didn’t have to 
dwell on them, and you could read more than one word at a time.
 
The larger your vocabulary is, the more words you recognize off 
the bat when you read. You can take in more words with an eye 
fixation when you recognize the words, which is why enlarging 
your vocabulary is essential to being a speed reader. Check out 
Chapter 12 for more on expanding your vocabulary.
Eye fixations and topic familiarity
How familiar you are with a topic is another factor influencing how 
many words you can see in a single eye fixation. When you read 
about a topic in your area of expertise or field of interest, you read 
more confidently, and you’re able to read more quickly with fewer 
eye fixations because you’re at home with the author’s words and 
terminology.
Your background, your general knowledge, your knowledge base 
(to borrow a computer term), your education — these factors 
also determine how fast you can read. People with a breadth of 
knowledge read faster because more is familiar to them. By making 
reading more efficient and pleasurable, speed reading encourages 
you to read, which in turn widens your breadth of knowledge and 
makes you read even faster.
Exercising Your Eye Fixations
Exercise 3-1 is designed to help you understand where your eyes 
fixate when you read and the role eye fixations play in reading. In 
Practice Text 3-1, you see two side-by-side versions of an essay

called “Say Thanks Before It’s Just a Memory” by nationally syndi-
cated columnist Harvey Mackay (originally published October 4, 
1998). Follow these steps to complete the exercise:
 
1. Note the time you start reading.
 
2. Read the essay on the left at your normal reading speed.
 
 The number to the right of each line tells you how many 
words are in that line.
 
3. After you finish reading, write down how long it took 
to read the first version of essay on the worksheet in 
Appendix B.
 
4. Note the time you start reading the second presentation 
of the essay, the one on the right side of the page.
 
5. Read the essay and try to fixate on each line the number 
of recommended times.
 
 To the left of each line in this essay is a number that tells 
you how many times to fixate your eyes in that line. To help 
with your eye fixations, I’ve italicized every other set of 
words that I want you to fixate on. Try to limit the number of 
times you fixate on each line to the number indicated.
 
6. After you finish reading the second presentation of 
the essay, write down how long you take to read it in 
Appendix B and compare your first reading time to your 
second reading time.
 
 Did you read faster when you made fewer eye fixations?

Say Thanks Before It’s Just a Memory
By Harvey Mackay
Some time ago the owner of a small but profitable 
business wrote columnist Ann Landers about his 
practice of giving annual bonuses to his employees. 
The amounts were based on time served and salary 
levels.
He had been doing it for 16 years and in all that 
time only two employees had ever said “thank 
you.” Neither were still with the company. One 
passed away, and the other took early retirement.
The owner vowed that he wasn’t going to give any 
more bonuses, and if anyone complained, the 
response would be “There will be no bonuses this 
year because not one of our current employees has 
taken the time and trouble to say ‘thank you.’”

 Chapter 3: Understanding the Mechanics of Speed Reading 45
Comprehending Comprehension 
Mechanics
One reason a speed reader comprehends better than a slow 
reader is the speed reader’s superior ability to absorb the author’s 
thoughts and ideas in into his or her short-term memory. When 
you read slowly, you actually confuse your short-term memory, 
and this confusion impairs your ability to understand what you’re 
reading. The following sections explain how speed reading helps 
you exploit your short-term memory to better understand what 
you read.
Reading and your short-term 
memory
The short-term memory is a part of your brain that initially 
absorbs information. It can hold no more than five to seven facts 
or concepts, and only for a short period of time (which is why 
you forget that seven-digit phone number you just looked up if 
someone interrupts you before you can dial). After that initial 
short-term storage period, the facts are either crowded out by 
other facts or assimilated into your long-term memory, where they 
become a part of your permanent knowledge.
Reading is the act of assimilating information, first into your short-
term memory, and then (if you’re able to assimilate it further) into 
your long-term memory. Here is roughly what happens when you 
read:
 
1. In a single eye fixation, you take in 1 to 14 words.
 
2. Your eyes move along the sentence to another fixation 
point. During this fraction of a second, an image of the 
words you saw flashes to your brain and is stored as a unit 
of meaning in your short-term memory.
 
3. Your mind calls for more units of meaning.
 
4. You take in another 1 to 14 words in an eye fixation.
 
5. Your eyes again move along the sentence, and an image of 
the last unit of meaning you took in flashes in your brain. 
This unit enters your short-term memory beside the unit of 
meaning that is already there.

Part I: Introducing Speed Reading 
46
These steps are repeated until your short-term memory fills to 
capacity. At that time, concepts you have imported into your 
short-term memory either disappear or are recoded (chunked) so 
that your long-term memory can retain them.
Assimilating concepts and ideas
Cognitive psychologists use the term chunking to describe how 
your brain reorganizes concepts and ideas you’ve absorbed in 
your short-term memory and applies them to your own experience 
so you can understand them. Chunking is essentially what happens 
when you retain what you’ve read.
Speed readers are better chunkers — they comprehend reading 
material better — because they can hold more advanced concepts 
in their short-term memories. Rather than five to seven words or 
small word groups, they can hold five to seven complex thought 
units. When the time comes to absorb the information and make 
it their own, they have more material to work with. More of the 
author’s ideas come to them at once.
For example, consider how a slow and a fast reader take in this 
paragraph differently:
The rotator cuff is a group of four muscles (and their tendons) 
that stabilize and govern movement of the shoulder. The 
muscles form a covering around the top of the upper arm bone 
(humerus). The rotator cuff enables the arm to rotate.
A slow reader with a narrow vision span can only hold a few of 
these concepts at once in short-term memory: rotator cuff, muscle 
group, four muscles with tendons, stability, movement. But a fast 
reader capable of reading many words at the same time can take 
in the entire paragraph in five to seven eye fixations. A fast reader 
can take in and assimilate the whole of the author’s ideas.
Exploring the Pacer Question
The stereotypical speed reader reads with a pacer. A pacer is a 
visual aid — it can be your finger, your hand, or a paper pacer 
like the ones that come on the Cheat Sheet of this book — that 
assists in speed reading. In the stereotype, the speed reader runs 
his finger down the page, frantically gobbling words at a hundred 
miles per hour and absorbing an entire page almost as fast as he 
can turn the page.

 Chapter 3: Understanding the Mechanics of Speed Reading 47
Many speed-reading courses include instructions for using your 
finger or hand as a pacer when you read. You learn the relative 
merits of different pacer motions (such as the Vulcan, the Open-
Hand Wiggle, and the Snake) and when to use this or that pacer 
motion in your reading.
Here’s my take on using a pacer: A pacer can be helpful when 
you’re a beginning speed reader, but you should abandon the 
pacer as soon as you grasp the fundamentals of speed reading.
In the exercises in this book, I sometimes ask you to use a small, 
medium, or large cut-out pacer (found on the Cheat Sheet at the front 
of this book). I suggest using these tools because I want you to focus 
on word clumps, word groups, thought units, and units of meaning as 
you read the exercises, and the cut-out pacers help with that. They 
help you grasp more than one word at a time in your reading and 
expand your vision so you can take in several words at a time.
Similarly, using your hand or forefinger as a pacer can help you 
expand your vision. Moving your hand or finger down the page 
encourages you to expand your vertical vision and see words on 
more than one line. If you want to experiment with using your hand 
or finger as a pacer, I’m not going to stop you. Check it out and see 
if works for you. If you want to use your mouse cursor as a pacer 
when you read on your computer screen, I’m not going to stop you 
there either. It may be helpful.
However, I believe that pacers in the long run don’t enable you to 
read faster, and I’m not alone. Many reading educators believe that 
using a pacer can be detrimental to reading speed and comprehen-
sion. You read with your eyes and your brain, not your fingers. The 
mental resources you apply to moving your finger on the page can 
be put to better use expanding your vision and recognizing word 
groups and thought units with your eyes and brain. After you have 
mastered the fundamentals of speed reading, using a pacer is a dis-
traction. It actually slows down your reading.
The mother of invention
Evelyn Wood, the speed reading pioneer, popularized the use of pacers in speed 
reading. Wood’s speed reading courses were advertised on television in the 1960, 
1970s, and 1980s; she coined the term speed reading. I knew Evelyn, and she once 
told me how she got the idea to use pacers: Frustrated that she couldn’t read faster, 
she threw the book she was reading on the ground. When she brushed the dirt off 
its pages, she discovered the usefulness of moving her hand down the page to 
increase her reading speed.

Deciding How Much to Bring 
to Your Reading
Before you start reading anything, ask yourself, “How much do I 
need to bring to my reading?”
How fast you read and the level of concentration you bring to your 
reading is really a question of why you read. If you’re reading for 
pleasure, read slowly and luxuriate in the words. If time is of the 
essence because you’re reading for an exam or important meeting, 
you have no choice but to read quickly.
Here are some questions to ask yourself before you decide how 
much to bring to what you read.
 
✓ How important is retaining the knowledge I get from this 
reading? For example, if you’re exploring a topic that will 
advance your career, you need to read with care. For that 
matter, you may consider underlining words or writing notes 
in the margin. This type of reading requires your utmost con-
centration. On the other hand, if you’re reading a menu, you 
can read entirely at your leisure.
 
✓ What do I want to get out of this reading? How you answer 
this question determines how fast you read. If your reading has 
an important purpose — if you will be tested on what you read 
or you need the information for a paper or presentation — you 
must read with a higher level of concentration. But if you’re 
reading the sports pages of the newspaper or a detective novel, 
you can take your sweet time.
 
✓ What type of information is being presented? Facts and 
figures require more concentration to absorb. On the other 
hand, dialogue is easy to read.

Chapter 4
Introducing Speed-Reading 
Fundamentals
In This Chapter
▶ Expanding your horizontal and vertical vision span 
▶ Reading word by word and clump by clump
▶ Testing your ability to recognize and read word groups
▶ Developing the mindset of a speed reader
T
his chapter takes you on a tour of speed-reading fundamentals; 
along the way, you get the opportunity to do speed-reading 
exercises. The idea is for you to see for yourself why grasping the 
fundamentals of speed reading can vastly improve your speed-
reading skills.
By applying yourself to the speed-reading exercises in this 
chapter — by doing each exercise — you can become a better, 
more aware speed reader. Although completing all the exercises 
obviously gives you the greatest benefit, even taking on just a 
couple of them shows you how easily speed reading improves 
your reading.
Remember: The concepts introduced in this chapter are explained 
in more detail throughout this book. I just want you to get your 
feet wet here. Don’t be shy. The water isn’t that cold.
Widening Your Vision Span
As Chapter 3 explains in detail, your eyes move across the page in 
stops and starts called eye fixations, and with each fixation, they 
settle on one word or set of words after another. To improve your 
reading speed, you need to take in more words with each eye fixa-
tion, and to do that, you need to increase your vision span.

Part I: Introducing Speed Reading 
50
Exercise 4-1 makes you aware of how your eyes move — that is, 
your eye fixations — when you read and gives you practice in wid-
ening your vision span. The exercise presents four-, five-, six-, and 
seven-digit numbers; the goal is for you to read and process each 
number in a single eye fixation.
For this exercise, you need a pen or pencil and a piece of paper to 
write on, plus a pacer from the Cheat Sheet at the front of this book. 
This exercise tests and strengthens your ability to see many charac-
ters at once. Follow these instructions to complete the exercise:
 
1. Moving your pacer down the first column of Practice Text 
4-1, glance at a number.
 
 Only look at the number one time. Don’t linger — see 
whether you can take it in with one glance.
 
2. Write down the number on your piece of paper.
 
3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 until you’ve moved your pacer 
down all the columns and written down all the numbers.
 
4. Compare the numbers you wrote down to the actual 
numbers and record your correct/incorrect scores on the 
worksheet in Appendix B.
Chances are you wrote down a few numbers incorrectly, but that’s 
okay. As you become more aware of your eye fixations when you 
read, your vision span will widen, and you’ll become more adept at 
reading more digits and numbers with a single eye fixation. After 
you have more experience with speed reading, retry this exercise 
and see whether your score improves.

Exercise 4-2 also helps you widen your horizontal vision span. For 
this exercise, you need a pen or pencil and a pacer from the Cheat 
Sheet. Follow these steps:
 
1. Choose a target number (a number from 1 to 9).
 
2. Move the pacer to the first line of Practice Text 4-2, direct 
your eyes at the middle number (it’s italicized to help 
you identify it), and read the numbers on that line.
 
 Try to take in all the numbers in the line in a single glance. 
Don’t move your eyes left or right from that italicized 
number.
 
3. Notice how many times the target number you chose in 
Step 1 appears in the row of numbers.
 
 For example, if you choose 3 as your target number, notice 
in the first line that the number 3 appears twice.
 
4. At the end of the line, write down how many times the 
target number appears without glancing back at the 
numbers.
 
 If your target number appears twice, for example, write 2 at 
the end of the line.
 
5. Move the pacer down the lines and repeat Steps 2 
through 4 until you finish reading line 20.

6. Total the number of times your target number appeared 
and compare your totals to the answer key.
 
 For example, if you chose 3, your target number appeared 
20 times.
Repeat this exercise five or six times, choosing a different target 
number each time. Your ability to pick out target numbers will 
increase as you repeat the exercise.

Reading Clump by Clump
As I explain in Chapter 6, something magical happens when you 
stop reading word by word and start reading in clumps — you 
read several words with each eye fixation. Because you take in 
more words at a time, you don’t have to decode each word as you 
read it. You can understand the words in context, which increases 
your comprehension and retention.
To help illustrate this change, check out Exercise 4-3. It presents 
two-, three-, and four-word phrases that carry meaning. For that 
reason, you can read each phrase in a single eye fixation without 
having to consider individual words. Your increased reading speed 
in this exercise demonstrates that you can read more than one 
word at once and that reading more than one word at time indeed 
increases your reading speed.
For Exercise 4-3, time how long it takes to read all the phrases in 
Practice Text 4-3. Using a Cheat Sheet pacer, read each phrase in 
one glance if you can. Write down how long this exercise takes you 
on the worksheet in Appendix B.

Reading Vertically as Well 
as Horizontally
As Chapter 6 explains, speed reading isn’t just about widening 
your horizontal vision — it’s also about being able to read words 
vertically on the page. Besides reading words that are side by side, 
you take in words that are above and below one another.
To help you get a jump on this skill, Exercise 4-4 presents two-, 
four-, six-, and eight-word clumps. The clumps are presented, 
respectively, on two, two, three, and four lines. The goal is for you 
to develop the ability to read words vertically on the page as well 
as horizontally. Don’t worry — it isn’t as hard as it seems.
To increase your vertical reading span, move your Cheat Sheet 
pacer down the columns in Practice Text 4-4, reading the word 
clumps as you go along. Try to take in each clump of words in 
a single eye fixation without vocalizing (saying and hearing the 
words as you read); vocalizing prevents you from being able to 
read all the words at once.

Working with Word Groups
After you master reading clumps, you can graduate to reading 
word groups. As Chapter 7 explains, a word group is similar to a 
clump, except a word group has meaning — it’s a collection of 
words that hang together in a sentence. For example, prepositional 
phrases and subordinate clauses are word groups. If you can spot 
these word groups in the course of your reading, you can read 
that much more quickly because you can rapidly take in the word 
groups.
Grasping word groups as you read
If picking up on word groups seems difficult to you, check out 
Exercise 4-5, which demonstrates that you already have an apti-
tude for perceiving word groups. In this exercise, you take in 
groups of words that have been scrambled and see whether you 
can recode them as word groups.
Practice Text 4-5 presents three- and four-word phrases. Each 
phrase is presented first with the words out of order and then with 
the words in the correct order. For this exercise, move a pacer 
(found on the Cheat Sheet) down the column and read, in a single 
glance, each set of out-of-order words. As you read each set, see 
whether you can recode the words in the correct order and then 
move the pacer down the column to check your arrangement. This 
exercise demonstrates that you’re capable of reading word groups 
because it shows you that you can quickly take in words without 
regard to their proper order.

Getting the knack for spotting 
word groups
As your speed reading skills develop, you pick up a knack for locat-
ing word groups in sentences and reading them quickly. Exercise 
4-6 presents an essay provided by Rogers Historical Museum 
(Rogers, Arkansas) with the first half divided for you into word 
groups. Try to read each line (word group) in the first half of 
Practice Text 4-6 in one glance. When you reach the second half of 
the essay, you have to identify the word groups on your own; con-
tinue trying to read each word group in a single glance.

In Anglo-American culture
the bride’s family
traditionally bears most
of the cost of the wedding
and associated events.
In the 19th and early 20th century
most weddings were low-key and inexpensive,
but the wealthy used a wedding
as yet another opportunity
for conspicuous display
The traditional sequence of events
leading to the wedding
began with a bachelor dinner,
often called a stag party in the 20th century,
and a tea for bridesmaids.
If the wedding was to be
a formal event
then a rehearsal dinner was customary
the night before the wedding itself.
The wedding vows in use by the 1800s
were a combination of
the ancient betrothal and wedding vows
combined into one ceremony.
The giving of a ring to the bride
and the joining of hands
remained part of most wedding ceremonies.
A plain, rather narrow gold ring

 Chapter 4: Introducing Speed-Reading Fundamentals 63
Practice Text 4-6 (continued)
has been the most usual form of wedding ring
in the 1800s and 1900s.
But in the late 19th and early 20th centuries
wide, ornamented bands were common,
while in the 1920s
engraved white gold or platinum bands were fashionable.
World War II finally led American men
to adopt wedding bands
as a symbol of home and family,
and the number of double ring ceremonies increased.
A reception or dinner for guests
traditionally followed the wedding.
In the mid 1800s it was usual to hold the wedding
in the morning followed by
a wedding breakfast and then a lull before an evening dance.
The cutting of the cake has long been the highlight of the reception. In 
Victorian times the “wedding cake” was the fruitcake cut up and put in fancy 
boxes to distribute to the guests. The big cake, sometimes tiered, was called 
the “bride’s cake.”
Traditionally the bride’s cake had a single ring in it, but beginning in the 1920s 
more and more trinkets were added. Real flowers were the traditional decora-
tion for the bride’s cake in the 19th century, while in the 1920s more icing and 
the bride and groom figures were added.
After the reception the couple would leave for the honeymoon or go directly 
to their new home. The bride would toss a bouquet to the women, but in 
Victorian times she threw a special bouquet and kept her own.
The throwing of foodstuffs as a symbol of fertility has been a part of wedding 
custom for centuries. In the 1800s and into the 1900s rice was usual.
Before World War II the wedding photograph was usually taken before or 
most often after the wedding in a studio. In the late 1800s and early 1900s the 
photograph was taken after the wedding but probably in the same clothing.
The traditional pose at the time was the woman standing and the man sitting, 
with her hand on his shoulder or the chair. By the mid 1900s the couple usu-
ally stood side by side.

Taking On Continuous Text
Chapter 8 explores why continuous text like the kind found in news-
paper articles is easiest to speed read: because this text is already 
broken into five-to-ten-word columns that make for natural word 
groups. You can take in all five to ten words in the column in one 
eye fixation and therefore can read a newspaper article quickly.
To give you a preview of this skill, Exercise 4-7 contrasts reading 
text in columns with reading text in blocks (like the text blocks 
found in this and most other books). The exercise presents the 
same essay, “What They Don’t Teach You in School,” in a text 
block and in columns. You read the essay twice and answer the 
same comprehension questions after each reading to gauge how 
much easier the column version is.
Follow these steps to complete the first half of Exercise 4-7:
 
1. Timing yourself, read the text-block version of the essay 
“What They Don’t Teach You in School” (Practice Text 4-7a).
 
2. Answer the comprehension questions that follow the text 
block.
 
 You’ll answer the same questions again after you finish 
the second half of the exercise and compare your 
comprehension.
 
3. Record how long you take to read the essay, your word-
per-minute (WPM) reading rate, and your effective read-
ing rate (ERR) in Appendix B.
 
 Appendix B explains how to calculate your word per 
minute rate and effective reading rate.

What They Don’t Teach You in School
by Harvey Mackay, nationally syndicated columnist
Originally published June 17, 2007
As many college graduates are scrambling to find jobs, one of 
the most important things for graduates to understand is that 
you’re in school all your life. In fact, your real education is just 
beginning.
I’d like to pass on a few lessons, which weren’t necessarily cov-
ered in school. If you’ve been out of school for a few years — or 
a lot of years — this advice is still for you; consider it a refresher 
course.

 Chapter 4: Introducing Speed-Reading Fundamentals 65
Practice Text 4-7a (continued)
Develop relationships and keep networking. If I had to name 
the single characteristic shared by all the truly successful 
people I’ve met over a lifetime, I’d say it is the ability to create 
and nurture a network of contacts. Start strengthening your 
relationships now, so they’ll be in place when you really need 
them later. In the classroom it was mostly about your individ-
ual performance. Success in real life will require relationships. 
Who you know determines how effectively you can apply what 
you know. So stay in touch.
Find advisors and mentors. Advisors will not be assigned to 
you, as in school. You should actively seek your own mentors. 
And remember, mentors change over a lifetime. Start connect-
ing with people you respect who can help you get a leg up in 
each aspect of your life, personal and professional. Make it as 
easy and convenient as possible for them to talk with you, and 
always look for ways to contribute to their success, too.
Build your reputation. Nothing is more important than a good 
reputation in building a successful career or business. If you 
don’t have a positive reputation, it will be difficult to be suc-
cessful. All it takes is one foolish act to destroy a reputation.
Set goals. Ask any winner what their keys to success are, and 
you will hear four consistent messages: vision, determina-
tion, persistence and setting goals. If you don’t set goals to 
determine where you’re going, how will you know when you 
get there? Goals give you more than a reason to get up in the 
morning; they are an incentive to keep you going all day. Most 
important, goals need to be measurable, identifiable, attain-
able, specific and in writing.
Get along with people. Ask recruiters from various companies 
to name the number one skill necessary for new hires, and 
many of them will say it’s the ability to get along with people. 
Co-workers share office space, facilities, break rooms, refrig-
erators and coffee pots. They arrive together, take breaks 
together, eat lunch together and meet to solve problems 
together. All this closeness and familiarity can wear thin at 
times. Everyone shares responsibility for making the company 
work, run smoothly and stay profitable
Be happy. We are all responsible for our own happiness. Don’t 
waste time and energy being unhappy. When people aren’t 
happy doing what they do, they don’t do it as well. Life will 
always be filled with challenges and opportunities. Both are 
best faced with a positive attitude.

Smile. A smile should be standard equipment for all people. 
I learned years ago that one of the most powerful things you 
can do to have influence over others is to smile at them. 
Everything seems much easier with a smile.
Sense of humor. I’m a firm believer in using humor — not 
necessarily jokes. A good sense of humor helps to overlook 
the unbecoming, understand the unconventional, tolerate the 
unpleasant, overcome the unexpected and outlast the unbear-
able. There are plenty of times to be serious, but I believe that 
keeping things light and comfortable encourages better team-
work.
Be yourself. We all have areas that need a little work, but 
accepting who we are and making the most of our good points 
will take us much farther than trying to be someone we aren’t. 
Be content with your abilities and comfortable enough in your 
own skin to trust your gut.
Volunteer. It might be hard to do a lot of volunteer work at 
first, but people who help other people on a regular basis have 
a healthier outlook on life. They are more inclined to be go-
getters and consistently report being happier. Volunteering is 
good for everyone.
Now answer the following comprehension questions about the 
essay — don’t forget to come back and answer these questions 
again after you read the essay in column form. The answer key 
appears after the second version of the essay (but no peeking until 
you’ve completed both parts of the exercise).

“But wait!” you say. “Won’t I read the second version faster anyway 
because I’m already more familiar with it from the first reading?” 
The answer is most likely yes. However, the benefit you get from 
reading in columns is still greater than any extra push you get from 
having seen the text already.
Here’s how to complete the second half of Exercise 4-7:
 
1. Timing yourself again, read the column version of the 
same essay (Practice Text 4-7b) and then flip back and 
answer the comprehension questions again.
 
 As you read, try to take in the words in each line with a single 
glance. Aim your vision at the center of the column and read 
the words across the column with your peripheral vision.
 
 As you answer the questions, notice to how much more 
quickly and confidently you remember the answers.
 
2. Write down how long you take to read the column 
version of the essay and your effective reading rate 
in Appendix B.
 
 Spoiler alert: Reading the essay in column form should take 
you less time.

Sense of humor. I’m a firm believer 
in using humor — not necessarily 
jokes. A good sense of humor helps 
to overlook the unbecoming, under-
stand the unconventional, tolerate the 
unpleasant, overcome the unexpected 
and outlast the unbearable. There 
are plenty of times to be serious, but 
I believe that keeping things light 
and comfortable encourages better 
teamwork.
Be yourself. We all have areas that 
need a little work, but accepting who 
we are and making the most of our 
good points will take us much farther 
than trying to be someone we aren’t. 
Be content with your abilities and 
comfortable enough in your own skin 
to trust your gut.
Volunteer. It might be hard to do a lot 
of volunteer work at first, but people 
who help other people on a regular 
basis have a healthier outlook on 
life. They are more inclined to be go-
getters and consistently report being 
happier. Volunteering is good for 
everyone.
Dollars to doughnuts, it took you about a third less time to read 
the essay in column form. Why is that? Because reading in columns 
encourages you to read word group by word group rather than 
word by word. 
 
If you had trouble with this exercise, you can get more practice by 
focusing on word groups as you read your newspaper.
Getting Into the Speed-Reading 
Mindset
Speed reading isn’t just a set of techniques for reading faster — it’s 
also a mindset. When you speed read, you read aggressively and 
with more concentration. Exercise 4-8 focuses you on the speed-
reading mindset and its effect on your reading speed. Follow these 
steps to complete this exercise:
 
1. Using a timer, read as much of the essay “Disappointment 
Is Opportunity in Disguise” (Practice Text 4-8) as you can 
in 60 seconds.
 
2. When 60 seconds have passed, circle the last word you 
read.

Part I: Introducing Speed Reading 
70
 
3. Reset the timer, start reading the essay again, and read as 
far as you can in 50 seconds.
 
 Read aggressively with renewed concentration. See 
whether you can read the same number of words you read 
in Step 1 in 50 seconds. Being familiar with the text ought 
to help you break the 50-second mark, 
 
4. Circle the last word you read when the 50 seconds 
expired and compare to your 60-second progress.
 
 Even if you don’t quite reach your earlier stopping point, 
you may be surprised by just how close you get.
 
5. Read the essay a third time for 40 seconds and see 
whether you can match your progress from Step 3.
This exercise demonstrates the value of reading aggressively. As 
you become more confident with your speed reading, you find it 
easier and easier to adopt the aggressive speed-reading mindset.

Disappointment Is Opportunity in Disguise
by Harvey Mackay, nationally syndicated columnist
Originally published February 1, 1999
On Super Bowl Sunday, it was a real challenge for me to watch 
the game at home and not wish I were in Miami losing my voice 
and cheering for my hometown team, the Minnesota Vikings, 
to win it all.
Of course, we should have been there. The best offense in 
football. A record-breaking season for scoring the most points 
ever. The perfect kicker. The Vegas favorite to win the Super 
Bowl. And then, ouch! The overtime loss to Atlanta. I’ve never 
heard the “Thunderdome” so quiet. Sixty-five thousand silent 
fans. The disappointment was crushing. We all sat there in 
shock. We were waiting for something — anything — to make 
it all better. Not this time. But there’s always next year.
Handling disappointment is one of life’s little challenges, and 
often an indication of how we deal with adversity at work as 
well. Anyone who has been in business can tell war stories 
about the bumps in the road. But if they’ve outlasted the com-
petition, ask for their stories about survival. They’ve figured 
out how to turn disappointments into opportunities.

 Chapter 4: Introducing Speed-Reading Fundamentals 71
Lose one of your best customers? Bummer. But it’s not neces-
sarily a defeat. Find out why their orders are going elsewhere. 
If you messed up, fix what you can and resolve not to make 
the same mistake again. If the purchasing manager has a new 
brother-in-law who sells for your competition, well, that’s not 
a disappointment anymore. That’s your new challenge. Just 
don’t lower your expectations. If you expect nothing, that’s 
exactly what you’ll get.
Didn’t get the promotion? Be honest with yourself. Were you 
right for the job? Was it right for you? Do you have a future 
with the company? Use your disappointment to do some soul-
searching. If there were two qualified people ahead of you, it 
could be a matter of timing. If you’ve been passed over before, 
it’s time to quit being disappointed and recognize that you 
might have to jump to another lily pad. You’ll thank your old 
company later for helping you get out in time.
Take a lesson from James Whitaker, the first American to reach 
the summit of Mount Everest. Even though he was emotionally 
and physically prepared, he encountered more than his share 
of disappointments: avalanches, dehydration, hypothermia, 
and the physical and mental fatigue caused by the lack of 
oxygen at 29,000 feet. Why did Whitaker succeed where so 
many had given in to their disappointments? “You don’t really 
conquer such a mountain,” he said. “You conquer yourself. 
You overcome the sickness and everything else — your pain, 
aches, fears — to reach the summit.”
Achievers, like Whitaker, focus on the road, rather than the 
bumps in it, to reach their destination.
Okay, you’re on the other side of the desk. Can’t find the right 
person for a job? That’s not a disappointment, that’s a busi-
ness emergency. It’s time to call in the pros. I use a headhunter 
and an industrial psychologist for all my key hires. I can’t 
afford to be disappointed.
Is your staff underperforming? Time for another look in the 
mirror. Perhaps they’re as disappointed in you as you are in 
them. If you can make their job more satisfying . . . challenging 
. . . rewarding, do it. The results won’t disappoint you.

Next time you’re on the golf course, pick up your golf ball 
and take a close look. The first golf balls manufactured had 
smooth covers. An avid, but broke, golfer couldn’t afford new 
ones, so he used whatever he found along the course: beat 
up, nicked golf balls. His playing partners soon noticed that 
their smooth-covered balls didn’t fly as accurately or as far as 
his. What was going on? But they finally figured out what gave 
their friend the advantage.
Today, golf balls have as many as 432 dimples. The “rough 
spots” enhance the ball’s distance and accuracy.
Life’s like that: rough spots sharpen our performance. And 
more often than not, the obstacles can be turned into advan-
tages. You just can’t let your disappointment get in the way.

In this part...
T
his part explores the handful of fundamental skills you 
need to be a great speed reader. It also offers tons of 
hands-on practice in mastering those fundamentals — it’s 
your chance to really get going as a speed reader.
Chapter 5 provides your fi rst speed-reading test to fi nd 
out how fast a reader you are. Chapter 6 shows how to 
expand your reading vision to take in several words at a 
time as you read. Chapter 7 looks into the cognitive aspect 
of speed reading, demonstrating how to read for the 
author’s thoughts and not just her words.

Chapter 5
Establishing Your Reading Rate
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the formulas experts use to calculate reading speeds
▶ Figuring out your starting reading rate and comparing it to others’
▶ Factoring speed-reading techniques into your reading rate
H
ow fast do you read? In this chapter, you get a definitive 
answer. I present two speed-reading tests so that you know 
your words-per-minute (WPM) reading rate and your effective 
reading rate (ERR).
You also find out where you stand as a speed reader and how much 
practice you need to keep improving. You discover how the experts 
calculate reading speeds and how you can calculate your speed. 
This chapter also demonstrates how you can dramatically improve 
your speed just by changing your mindset before you begin reading. 
Use Appendix B to log your scores and chart your progress.
How the Experts Test
 Speed-Reading Rates
Experts use two techniques to test how fast people read. One tech-
nique measures how many words you read per minute; the other 
test takes into account how well you comprehend what you read 
as well as how fast you read. Knowing both rates is helpful. The 
word-per-minute test gives a raw measure of how fast you read, 
and the comprehension tests keep you honest by making sure you 
understand the author’s words as well as read quickly. The follow-
ing sections describe these techniques, and then the rest of this 
chapter helps you determine your scores.
 
Throughout this book, I have you calculate and write down your ERR 
and WPM rate. Fold down the corner of this page. If you find yourself 
scratching your head and struggling to remember how to calculate 
the rates, head back here for a refresher. Or go to Appendix B, which 
also explains how to calculate ERR and WPM scores.

Part II: Focusing on the Fundamentals 
76
Words per minute (WPM) testing
The WPM test isn’t very different from a typing test. All it measures 
is how many words you read per minute. Experts use the following 
formula to get the results for a WPM reading test:
Words read ÷ reading time in minutes = WPM rate
For example, someone who takes 2 minutes to read 700 words 
reads at a 350 WPM rate:
700 ÷ 2 = 350
Someone who takes 2.25 minutes (2 minutes, 15 seconds) to read 
700 words reads at a 311 WPM rate:
700 ÷ 2.25 = 311
Above-average readers read at a 300 to 700 WPM rate. Spead read-
ers can read more than 700 words per minute.
Effective reading rate (ERR) testing
“I took a speed reading course once,” Woody Allen said. “We read 
War and Peace in 20 minutes. It was about Russia.” For an ERR test, 
though, Woody Allen and his classmates would have to answer 
questions about the Tolstoy novel they read as well as report how 
fast they read it.
The effective reading rate (ERR) measures comprehension as 
well as speed. ERR testing is a more thorough measure of speed-
reading rates than WPM testing (discussed in the previous section) 
because it tests comprehension, retention, and recall. The test 
also indicates how strong your vocabulary is and the knowledge 
reserves that you bring to the table when you start reading.
Experts use the following formula to get the results of an ERR test:
WPM rate × comprehension percentage score (as decimal) = ERR
Someone who reads 700 words at 350 WPM and answers 80 percent 
of the comprehension questions correctly reads at a 280 ERR rate:
350 × .8 = 280
 
Effective readers should score at least 80 percent on the compre-
hension test.

 Chapter 5: Establishing Your Reading Rate 77
Establishing Your Base 
Reading Rate
Get ready to jump in and take your first speed-reading test. This 
test establishes your starting rate so you can see how fast a reader 
you are and how much you improve in the course of your speed-
reading studies.
For this test, read without adopting any of the speed-reading 
principles you may have already read about in this book. Read as 
though you don’t know anything about speed reading. The idea is 
to get your base speed-reading rate.
Follow these steps to take your first speed-reading test in 
Exercise 5-1:
 
1. Using a clock, watch, or stopwatch, note what time you 
begin reading.
 
2. Read “John F. Kennedy’s Inaugural Address” (Practice 
Text 5-1).
 
3. Record how long you take to read the speech and then 
consult Table 5-1 to get your WPM rate.
 
 If your reading time doesn’t match one in the chart (or you 
just want to brush up on your math skills), you can also 
determine your WPM rate by dividing 1447 (the number 
of words in the speech) by the amount of time you spent 
reading it. If you get a number with a decimal (such as 
723.5), round up to the next number.
 
4. Answer the comprehension questions without revisiting 
the essay and note how many questions you answer 
correctly (0, 20, 40, 60, 80, or 100 percent of the 
questions).
 
5. Use the percentage from Step 4 to find your ERR in 
Table 5-1.
 
 Alternately, you can multiply your WPM rate from Step 3 
by 0, .2, .4, .6, .8, or 1 based on the percentage of questions 
you answered correctly.
 
6. Enter your WPM rate and ERR for this reading selection 
on the worksheet in Appendix B.

John F. Kennedy’s Inaugural Address
We observe today not a victory of party but a celebration of 
freedom — symbolizing an end as well as a beginning — 
signifying renewal as well as change for I have sworn before 
you and Almighty God the same solemn oath our forbears 
prescribed nearly a century and three-quarters ago.
The world is very different now, for man holds in his mortal 
hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all 
forms of human life. And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for 
which our forbears fought are still at issue around the globe — 
the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity 
of the state but from the hand of God. We dare not forget today 
that we are the heirs of that first revolution.
Let the word go forth from this time and place — to friend and 
foe alike — that the torch has been passed to a new genera-
tion of Americans — born in this century, tempered by war, 
disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient 
heritage — and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undo-
ing of those human rights to which this nation has always been 
committed, and to which we are committed today — at home 
and around the world.
Let every nation know — whether it wishes us well or ill — that 
we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, 
support any friend, oppose any foe, to assure the survival and 
the success of liberty. This much we pledge — and more.
To those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we 
share: we pledge the loyalty of faithful friends. United — 
there is little we cannot do in a host of co-operative ventures. 
Divided — there is little we can do — for we dare not meet a 
powerful challenge, at odds, and split asunder. To those new 
states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free: We pledge 
our word that one form of colonial control shall not have 
passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny. 
We shall not always expect to find them supporting our view. 
But we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting 
their own freedom — and to remember that — in the past — 
those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the 
tiger ended up inside. To those people in the huts and villages 
of half the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery: 
We pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves, for 
whatever period is required — not because the Communists 
may be doing it, not because we seek their votes, but because 
it is right. If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, 
it cannot save the few who are rich.

 Chapter 5: Establishing Your Reading Rate 79
To our sister republics south of our border: We offer a special 
pledge — to convert our good words into good deeds — in a 
new alliance for progress — to assist free men and free govern-
ments in casting off the chains of poverty. But this peaceful 
revolution of hope cannot become the prey of hostile powers. 
Let all our neighbors know that we shall join with them to 
oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the Americas — 
and let every other power know that this hemisphere intends 
to remain the master of its own house.
To that world assembly of sovereign states: The United 
Nations — our last best hope in an age where the instruments 
of war have far outpaced the instruments of peace, we renew 
our pledge of support — to prevent it from becoming merely a 
forum for invective — to strengthen its shield of the new and 
the weak — and to enlarge the area in which its writ may run.
Finally, to those nations who would make themselves our 
adversaries, we offer not a pledge but a request: that both 
sides begin anew the quest for peace; before the dark powers 
of destruction unleashed by science engulf all humanity in 
planned or accidental self-destruction. We dare not tempt 
them with weakness. For only when our arms are sufficient 
beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will 
never be employed. But neither can two great and powerful 
groups of nations take comfort from our present course — 
both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons, both 
rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom, yet 
both racing to alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays 
the hand of Mankind’s final war.
So let us begin a new — remembering on both sides that civil-
ity is not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject 
to proof. Let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never 
fear to negotiate. Let both sides explore what problems unite 
us instead of belaboring those problems which divide us. 
Let both sides, for the first time, formulate serious and pre-
cise proposals for the inspection and control of arms — and 
bring the absolute power to destroy other nations under the 
absolute control of all nations. Let both sides seek to invoke 
the wonders of science instead of its terrors. Together let us 
explore the stars, conquer the deserts, eradicate disease, tap 
the ocean depths, and encourage the arts and commerce. 
Let both sides unite to heed in all corners of the earth the 
command of Isaiah — to “undo the heavy burdens — let the 
oppressed go free.”

And if a beachhead of co-operation may push back the jungle 
of suspicion — let both sides join in creating not a new balance 
of power — but a new world of law — where the strong are 
just — and the weak secure — and the peace preserved . . . .
All this will not be finished in the first one hundred days. Nor 
will it be finished in the first one thousand days — nor in the 
life of this administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on 
this planet. But let us begin.
In your hands, my fellow citizens — more than mine — will rest 
the final success or failure of our course. Since this country 
was founded, each generation of Americans has been sum-
moned to give testimony to its national loyalty. The graves of 
young Americans who answered the call to service surround 
the globe. Now the trumpet summons us again — not as a call 
to bear arms, though arms we need — not as a call to battle — 
though embattled we are — but a call to bear the burden of a 
long twilight struggle — year in and year out, rejoicing in hope, 
patient in tribulation — a struggle against the common enemies 
of man: tyranny — poverty — disease — and war itself. Can 
we forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance — 
North and South — East and west — that can assure a more 
fruitful life for all mankind? Will you join in that historic effort?
In the long history of the world, only a few generations have 
been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maxi-
mum danger; I do not shrink from this responsibility — I wel-
come it. I do not believe that any of us would exchange places 
with any other people or any other generation. The energy, the 
faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light 
our country and all who serve it — and the glow from that fire 
can truly light the world.
And so, my fellow Americans — ask not what your country can 
do for you — ask what you can do for your country. My fellow 
citizens of the world — ask not what America will do for you, 
but what together we can do for the Freedom of Man.
Finally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the 
world, ask of us here the same high standards of strength and 
sacrifice which we ask of you. With a good conscience our 
only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds; let 
us go forth to lead the land we love, asking His blessing and 
His help, but knowing that here on earth God’s work must 
truly be our own.

 Chapter 5: Establishing Your Reading Rate 83
Seeing Where You Stand 
as a Speed Reader
After you know your WPM rate and your ERR, you may be curious 
to know how you compare to others in the speed-reading depart-
ment. (And who wouldn’t be?)
Roughly speaking, readers fall into these categories where speed is 
concerned:
 
✓ 1 to 200 WPM: You’re a talker. You read one word at a time 
at about the same speed as you talk and you may move your 
lips when you read. Most talkers are held back because they 
engage in vocalization while they read — they speak the 
words silently to themselves as they read them. Unless you’re 
an especially fast talker, reading at the speed you talk slows 
you down.
 
✓ 200 to 300 WPM: You’re an average reader, one who probably 
doesn’t enjoy reading as a hobby. You engage in some vocal-
ization as you read, but you can read several words at once. 
Most people read at this speed.
 
✓ 300 to 700 WPM: You’re an above average reader who can 
read groups of words in a single glance, recognizing and read-
ing phrases in sentences quickly. You vocalize a little when 
you read. You very likely have a large vocabulary.
 
✓ 700+ WPM: You’re a speed reader. You’re adept at reading 10 
to 16 words at a glance, both horizontally and vertically on the 
page. You read with a great degree of confidence and agility.
So if your ERR (established in the previous section) is 700 or 
above, take the rest of the day off and give yourself a raise while 
you’re at it. You don’t need speed-reading lessons — you’re 
already a fast reader. If your ERR isn’t as high as you want, keep 
reading.

Chapter 6
Taking in More than 
One Word at a Time: 
Reading in Clumps
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering what clumps are (and that you can already read them)
▶ Seeing words as shapes and images when you read
▶ Understanding macular and peripheral vision
▶ Changing your mindset when you read in clumps
▶ Developing your clump-reading ability
T
his chapter introduces the concept of reading in clumps, a 
necessary skill for speed readers. Loosely speaking, a clump is 
any collection of words that appear together on the page.
In this chapter, you find out what clump reading entails, how the 
eyes and mind work when you read in clumps, and how to make 
the shift from one-word-at-a-time reading to clump reading. I also 
give you many exercises that let you try your hand (okay, eyes) at 
clump reading.
What Is a Clump, Anyway?
Reading in clumps means to take in more than one word at a time 
in the course of your reading. A clump is a collection of 4 to 16 
next-to-each-other words that you read in a single glance (or eye 
fixation, discussed in Chapter 3). When you read in clumps, you 
naturally increase your speed because you can’t slow down to 
vocalize (speak or hear the words as you read them). After all, you 
can’t speak 4 to 16 words at a time without slurring the words or 
turning them into corned beef hash. 

Part II: Focusing on the Fundamentals 
86
Being able to read in clumps is an essential skill for speed readers. 
Throughout this book, you discover tricks for dividing the words 
you read into clumps. For example, in Chapter 7, you see how to 
recognize a prepositional phrase in the text as part of a clump and 
read it in one gulp. In this chapter, however, you just need to know 
that any group of 4 to 16 words can be read quickly as a clump. All 
you need is practice.
If the notion of reading in clumps seems odd or impossible, con-
sider this point: If you read a newspaper or religious text, you 
already know how to read in clumps. 
Newspapers are laid out in narrow columns, and each column 
is essentially a clump. Text in holy books such as the Bible and 
Koran always appears in columns as well. When you read text in 
columns, you’re prone to read in clumps, and that increases your 
reading speed. 
To see the advantages of reading in clumps, read the following news

Dramatic Cat Rescue on Green Street — block text
Pinkertown (August 14) — Residents of Green Street witnessed 
the noon rescue of a cat by firefighters yesterday. The cat, a 
tabby, was heard mewling in the branches of an elm tree for 
more than an hour before firefighters arrived on the scene and 
brought the cat down from a high branch with the use of a 
hook and ladder truck.
Two dozen witnesses burst into applause as the cat was res-
cued. The cat, Samantha, ran to the arms of its owner, Roberta 
Haynes Johannsen, after it was carried down from the tree.
“Samantha is always climbing up that tree, but this is the first 
time she wasn’t able to get down,” said Johannsen. “I would 
like to thank my neighbors for alerting the fire department. I 
was in back tending to my garden and didn’t hear Samantha’s 
cries.”

 Chapter 6: Reading in Clumps 87
This was the fourth time this year that the fire department was 
called upon to rescue a cat from a tree, according to Sergeant 
Dale Martinez, who supervised the rescue. “We don’t train our 
firefighters to rescue cats,” he said, “but we’re pretty good at 
it. Cats seem to like firefighters.”
Cats climb trees to avoid other cats and dogs, and to chase 
animals such as squirrels. However, the animals are more 
adept at climbing up than climbing down trees. Sometimes 
they get trapped on a high branch and are unable to come 
down unassisted.
“I hope Samantha has learned her lesson,” said Johannsen. “I 
wouldn’t want her to get caught in that tree again.”

Dramatic Cat Rescue on Green Street — divided text
Reading text in columns really is easier. I sometimes wonder 
why publishers don’t present text in columns in biographies and 
novels, for example. Column text encourages you to read faster.
Comprehending Clump-Reading 
Mechanics
You can read words in clumps because you read with your periph-
eral vision as well as your macular vision. By training yourself to use 
both types of vision when you read, you can become a speed reader. 
These pages explain how macular and peripheral vision work so 
that you get a better idea of how to become a speed reader.

Part II: Focusing on the Fundamentals 
90
Macular and peripheral vision
Even when you’re not reading, you see with two types of vision: 
 
✓ Macular vision is your primary focus. When you look directly 
at something, you see with your macular vision. It comes to 
you courtesy of the macula (an area of particularly sharp 
vision) of the retina in your eyes.
 
✓ Peripheral vision is what you see less distinctly in the area 
outside your macular vision. Because receptor cells on the 
retina of your eye are concentrated at the center and are less 
concentrated toward the edges, colors and shapes are harder 
to distinguish in peripheral vision (although you can quickly 
pick up on motion). But you can see to the left, to the right, 
above, and below the area bordered by your macular vision. 
To understand the difference between your macular and periph-
eral vision, try this short activity:
 
1. Hold a pencil about 12 inches in front of your nose and 
stare at the pencil so it’s fully in focus.
 
 What you see is the result of your macular vision.
 
2. Without gazing away from the pencil, notice the objects 
outside your macular vision. 
 
 These objects appear in your peripheral vision. Although they 
aren’t as sharply in focus as the pencil, you can see them. 
 
3. Pick an object outside your macular vision and try to see 
it but still see the pencil.
 
 If you can do this without crossing your eyes, you can read 
clumps with your peripheral vision.
Reading with your peripheral 
vision too
When you read in clumps, you read words in your peripheral as 
well as your macular vision. Horizontally, you read words to the 
left and right of your macular vision; vertically, you read words 
above and below your macular vision.
Training yourself to use your peripheral vision when reading isn’t a 
matter of improving your eyesight but rather of reading with more 
concentration and focus. As well as taking in what you see in your 
macular vision, you extend your eye span to take in what is in your 
peripheral vision.

 Chapter 6: Reading in Clumps 91
Using your peripheral vision allows you to read with fewer eye fixa-
tions because your vision span is wider and you can see, read, and 
process more words at a time. Instead of reading word-for-word, 
you can jump ahead by several words and read in clumps. For 
example, consider this sentence:
A thing of beauty is a joy forever.
If you read the sentence one word at a time, you read it like this:
A — thing — of — beauty — is — a — joy — forever.
But if you read it as a clump, making use of your peripheral vision 
as you read, you can focus on the word (or words) at the center 
of the sentence and rely on your peripheral vision to take in the 
words on either side. In this instance, your macular vision focuses 
on the word beauty, and your peripheral vision perceives the other 
words. Try focusing on the italicized word and taking in the other 
words with your peripheral vision:
A thing of beauty is a joy forever.
For Exercise 6-1, use your pacer (provided on the Cheat Sheet) to 
move down the columns in Practice Text 6-1, reading the numbers. 
Focus on the underlined digit(s) in the center of each number, and 
rely on your peripheral vision to read the number in its entirety. 
Doing so demonstrates how you can stretch your vision span and 
use your peripheral vision to read faster.

Recognizing images as words
Reading words in clumps is possible because when you read most 
words, you don’t see the letters in the words or the words per se. 
What you see on the page are images that you recognize from 
your past reading experience — that is, the words are in your 
vocabulary. 
The only time you actually see a word and examine all its letters 
is the first few times you encounter it. You have to examine the 
letters closely and commit the word to memory. After it becomes 
a part of your vocabulary, you can recognize its image. You can 
identify and process it quickly as part of a clump in the course of 
your reading.
Another example of recognizing a word as an image or shape is 
what happens when your name appears in print and your eye 
immediately jumps to it. Even if your name is buried in the middle 
of a paragraph, you see it instantly. You can see it right away 
because the image formed by the letters in your name, not your 
name itself, is instantly recognizable to you.

A capital I-dea
In English, the first-person singular pronoun I is always capitalized for a reason (and 
not just because English speakers have big egos). Capitalizing the word I became a 
spelling convention to make reading easier. The shape of the capital letter I is much 
easier to recognize than the shape of the lowercase i.

Part II: Focusing on the Fundamentals 
94
A word by any other shape . . .
In 1976, Graham Rawlinson, a researcher at Nottingham University, conducted an 
experiment to uncover what information readers get from letters and words when 
reading. He had volunteers read sentences in which the letters in the words were 
jumbled except for the first and last letters. For example, the word important would 
be spelled inrmoatpt, with the initial letter i and final letter t in the right places but 
all other letters mixed up or (to use the scientific term) randomized.
What Rawlinson discovered was surprising: People could read and comprehend 
the jumbled words almost as easily as unjumbled words. The experiment showed, 
Rawlinson wrote in New Scientist magazine, “that randomising letters in the middle 
of words had little or no effect on the ability of skilled readers to understand the 
text.”
Try this experiment yourself. Read the following paragraphs at normal speed. See 
whether you can understand the words as easily as you can understand words 
that aren’t jumbled.
 
 Rseaerch icntidaes taht the oerdr of the ltteers in a wrod dnsoe’t mettar. Waht 
relaly mtteras is the frist and lsat leettr in the wrod. If tehy are in the rhgit palce, 
you can raed the wdors.
 
 Wehn you raed, you dno’t raed evrey leettr in ecah wrod. You look at the wrod 
as a wlohe.
If you’re a typical reader, you were you able to read the paragraphs without any 
trouble. This experiment suggests that
 ✓ You read words as a whole when you read, not letter by letter.
 ✓ The first and last letter of a word may be the most important letters for recogniz-
ing a word because these letters define the word’s shape more than the others, 
and word shapes matter in reading.
 ✓ Context plays a role in reading. The words on either side of a word provide 
meaning to the word, and you can often tell what a word means by reading the 
words beside it. 
 ✓ If a word is familiar to you, you’re capable of recognizing it even if it’s 
misspelled.

 Chapter 6: Reading in Clumps 95
The following example demonstrates how you see images, or 
shapes, when you read, not letters. In the example, you see two 
identical paragraphs. In the first paragraph, a line is drawn through 
the top half of the letters; in the second, a line is drawn through 
the bottom half of the letters. 
Pinkerton is located between Redville and Whiteborough, in 
Palette County. The village had a population of 5,873 as of the 
2000 census. The major industry of the town is tourism. Of 
special interest are the Waldorf Caves, located south of the town, 
and the Pembroke Museum, famous for its Quaker quilts. The 
annual Moon Festival is held in the second week of June.

and the Pembroke Museum, famous for its Quaker quilts. The

The first paragraph is difficult to read because the line obscures the 
shapes made by the letters, and you have to work to decipher the 
message. The second paragraph, however, is easy to read because 
you can still see the word shapes and therefore read as you do 
normally, by observing the shapes and images made by the words. 
This example shows you that to some degree, reading words is just 
recognizing shapes.
Making the Shift to 
Clump Reading
Reading in clumps requires you to make a fundamental shift in the 
way you read. Instead of merely reading words, you perceive them 
on the page. You also make peripheral vision a part of your read-
ing and rely on context to give meaning to words you don’t know. 
Earlier in the chapter, I discuss perceiving words as images (in 
“Recognizing Images as Words”) and reading with peripheral vision 
(in “Comprehending Clump-Reading Mechanics”) In the follow-
ing sections, I show you how those concepts (plus using context 
clues) set the stage for your speed-reading success.

Part II: Focusing on the Fundamentals 
96
Changing your relationship 
to words on the page
In speech, one word always follows another, and the same is 
true when you read one word at a time. When reading in clumps, 
however, your eyes are like a camera that can take rapid-fire pho-
tographs — your eyes take a snapshot of several words, and your 
mind processes and understands what the words convey. Reading 
in clumps is a way of perceiving the words on the page rather than 
merely reading them. Instead of reading word by word, you read 
idea by idea. You read aggressively, scouring the page for ideas 
rather than words.
Widening your reading vision
Reading in clumps requires you to stretch your reading vision. 
Don’t be afraid to aggressively take in several words at a time; 
instead of beginning a line on the left margin, move the center of 
your vision — your macular vision — a third of the way into the 
line and begin reading there. Rely on your peripheral vision to take 
in the words to the left and right of the word you’re focusing on. 
The same idea applies to the end of a line — use your peripheral 
vision to take in the last few words instead of reading all the way to 
the end of the line.
 
When you read in clumps, you discover how to read a line of text 
with fewer eye fixations. And to do that, you have to stretch out 
your reading vision. You have to read with eyes that are wide and 
ready.
Reading in context
After you train yourself to read in clumps, you discover a remark-
able bonus benefit: Your comprehension, retention, and recall 
improve. Because you take in more words at a time, you don’t have 
to decode each word as you read it. When you read several words 
at once, each word provides meaning (context) to the words 
around it, and for that reason, you’re less likely to stumble over 
the meaning of an individual word.

 Chapter 6: Reading in Clumps 97
To see the benefits of reading in context, consider this sentence. 
If you read it one word at a time, you stumble over the word peda-
gogy (assuming you don’t already know that word):
His pedagogy in teaching reading was duly noted by the lead-
ing thinkers in the art and science of teaching.
However, if you can read in clumps, you can take in this sentence 
in two or three glances, and when you get to the end, you see that 
pedagogy is the art and science of teaching.
This ability to read words in context is one of the primary speed-
reading skills — and one of the primary reasons why speed read-
ers can read that much faster with improved comprehension, 
retention, and recall.
Getting More Practice 
Reading in Clumps
The remainder of this chapter provides exercises to help you get 
in the habit of reading in clumps and develop your horizontal and 
vertical peripheral vision. As you do these exercises, don’t be 
afraid to throw off your blinders and read entire groups of words. 
Reading in clumps requires a certain amount of daring. Go to it! Be 
bold if you want to acquire the ability to read it clumps.
 
Many of the activities in this section require one of the pacers from 
the Cheat Sheet at the front of this book, so be sure you have them 
handy.
Reading clump phrases
At its most basic, a clump is a collection of several words that are 
next to each other horizontally on the page. Exercise 6-2 gives you 
practice in reading this basic type of clump to help accustom you 
to reading in clumps and to expand your reading vision. In Practice 
Text 6-2, you see clumps ranging from four to eight words, with 
the centermost words in each clump underlined. Using your pacer, 
read down the columns. As you come to a new clump, focus first 
on the underlined words, and try to read the other words with 
your peripheral vision.

Reading sentence clumps
Like Exercise 6-2, Exercise 6-3 expands your reading vision and trains 
you to read clumps. But brace yourself: Exercise 6-3 is a little bit more 
challenging. Instead of phrases, you read Chinese fortune cookie for-
tunes courtesy of www.fortunecookiemessage.com. These clumps 
consist of whole sentences, not phrases, and in this regard they’re 
more like the clumps you encounter in real-life reading situations.
Move your pacer down the page and focus first on the underlined 
portion of each fortune in Practice Text 6-3. Try to read the words 
on either side of the underlined section with your peripheral 
vision. I hope you have good fortune doing this exercise!

Widening your vision: Reading 
horizontal and vertical clumps
Exercise 6-4 takes clump reading to a deeper level. To be a good 
speed reader, you must be able to read clumps vertically as well as 
horizontally, so in this exercise, you (surprise!) read in clumps hor-
izontally and vertically to give your reading vision a real stretch. 
Read down the columns in Practice Text 6-4 with your pacer, 
focusing your macular vision on the underlined words in each 
clump and your peripheral vision on the remaining words. (See 
“Macular and peripheral vision” earlier in this chapter for more on 
the two components of vision.) Try to take in the entire clump in 
one glance, whether it’s one line long or four. Focus hard on your 
vision as you complete this exercise. Thanks to Rogers Historical 
Museum (Rogers, Arkansas) for providing the text.

Getting the Gist 
from Word Groups
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the difference between clumps and word groups
▶ Seeing different types of word groups as units of meaning
▶ Improving your comprehension by reading word groups
I
n Chapter 6, you discover how to read in clumps and how 
reading this way allows you to take in many more words at a 
time and increase your reading speed. This chapter expands your 
speed-reading horizons a bit farther and explains how to read 
word groups. In speed-reading terminology, a word group is a set 
of 4 to 16 words that carry meaning within a reading selection. 
Reading word group by word group rather than word by word 
increases your reading comprehension. Word groups are critical 
because the author’s ideas are found in word groups.
This chapter explains in detail what a word group is and how you 
can quickly recognize word groups on the page. It demonstrates 
how you can increase your reading speed by leaps and bounds 
by taking in word groups at the speed with which you read single 
words. The exercises in this chapter help give you the confidence 
to read word groups and expand your reading vision so you can 
read larger and larger word groups.
Going Beyond Clumps 
to Word Groups
Reading in clumps is the art of taking in 4 to 16 or so words in a 
single eye fixation — in other words, in a single glance. (Chapter 6 
demonstrates how clumping words together rather than reading 
them one at a time increases your reading speed.) A word group 
is a more sophisticated clump (if you consider something called a 

Part II: Focusing on the Fundamentals 
106
“clump” sophisticated.) A word group comprises not just 4 
to 16 words, but 4 to 16 words that carry meaning. If you can 
recognize word groups, you can extract the author’s meaning 
that much more quickly. Because a word group is a unit of mean-
ing, recognizing word groups increases your comprehension as 
well as improves your speed because you can get the meaning out 
of the words at the same time as you read them quickly.
To help you understand the difference between clumps and word 
groups, take a look at these three paragraphs. The paragraphs are 
identical, but in the second I break the text into clumps, and in the 
third I break the text into word groups. As you read these para-
graphs, try to read the words with a single eye fixation. Notice how 
reading the clumps in a single eye fixation increases your reading 
speed, but reading the word groups in a single fixation allows you 
to get the meaning of the words as well as read them quickly.
Unbroken paragraph:
Our beach house on the Jersey Shore overlooks a boardwalk 
that extends for a mile to the north and five miles to the south. 
All year long when the weather is right, walkers and runners and 
cyclists pass by. The walkers are by far the most numerous.

when the weather is right,
walkers and runners and cyclists pass by.
The walkers are by far the most numerous.
The clumps in the second paragraph amount to nothing more than 
words strung together, but the word groups in the third paragraph 
have meaning. If you can take in clumps of words with meaning — 
if you can take in word groups — you can read that much faster 
and improve your comprehension as well.
Recognizing Word Groups
You can get a head start in recognizing word groups if you remem-
ber that word groups are the building blocks that make up every 
sentence in every piece of writing. The word groups are there; you 
just have to know how and where to look for them in the course 
of reading. Never fear — the following sections show you that you 
already know how to pick out some word groups. They also pro-
vide some tricks to help you find other, less obvious groups.
Getting the idea from idioms
One of the easiest ways to understand word groups is to consider 
the idiom. An idiom is a figure of speech that you recognize without 
having to interpret it. Better safe than sorry, take the bull by the horns, 
and there’s no place like home are examples of English idioms.
Every idiom is a word group because it’s a single unit of meaning 
that doesn’t have to appear in context with other words for read-
ers to understand its meaning. All a reader has to do is see the 
first couple of words of an idiom and the rest of the words usually 
come tumbling into place. You don’t have to read all the words 
because you already know them, which means even slow readers 
can read idioms quickly.
To see what I mean, read the following idioms. Try to read each 
one with a single eye fixation. You can probably do it because 
you’re already familiar with these idioms. Just glance at the words 
and you know their meanings instantly.
Look a gift horse in the mouth
In for a penny, in for a pound
Born with a silver spoon in his mouth
Between the devil and the deep blue sea

A fool and his money are soon parted
A case of the blind leading the blind
Damned if I do and damned if I don’t
Looks as if butter wouldn’t melt in his mouth
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me
Early to bed, early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise
Understanding word groups 
through idioms
The exercise in this section gives you practice in understanding how 
to read word groups by reading idioms. It demonstrates that you 
can see, read, and process a word group with a single eye fixation.
For Exercise 7-1, use a pacer provided on the Cheat Sheet at the 
front of this book and move it down the list as you read the idioms 
in Practice Text 7-1 courtesy of www.Idiomsite.com. Focusing on 
the underlined words in the middle of each idiom, try to read each 
idiom in a single eye fixation. Read each idiom left to right, and then 
go down to the next one. Push yourself to do this exercise as quickly 
as possible. Idioms are the easiest word groups to read. Return to 
this exercise from time to time to practice reading word groups.

Picking out prepositional phrases
A prepositional phrase is another type of word group that you can 
identify and grasp quickly in the course of reading. A prepositional 
phrase complements another part of a sentence to give it context. 
You can train yourself to recognize prepositional phrases in sen-
tences and read this kind of word group quickly.
You can spot a prepositional phrase because it almost always 
begins with one of these words:
about, above, across, after, against, along, among, around, at, 
before, behind, below, beneath, beside, between, beyond, by, 
despite, down, during, except, for, from, in, inside, into, near, off, 
of, on, onto, out, outside, over, past, through, throughout, till, to, 
toward, under, underneath, until, up, upon, with, within, without
A prepositional phrase provides what, where, when, which one, or 
how information to the rest of the sentence. Consider the preposi-
tional phrases in these sentences and what they convey:
 
Information 
Prepositional phrase
 
What 
The rule from the home office says so.
 
Where 
We found the key on the table.
 
When 
After the term ends, they will go fishing.
 
Which one 
She is the smartest of them all.
 
How 
By working harder, they finished first.
In the following sentences, I italicize the prepositional phrases. 
As you read these sentences, read the prepositional phrases with 
a single eye fixation. In this way, you get practice in picking out 
prepositional phrases and reading them quickly.
The book is on the table.
In the south of France, the weather is good.
We ordered pizza at the restaurant.
There was rejoicing throughout the land.
I am very tired of all this bickering.
All across the valley you could see the rainbow.
The letter from the marketing department explains it.
She read the book during class.
In addition, their proposal is the subject of a peer review.
The cat will be punished for chewing up a new pair of shoes.

 Chapter 7: Getting the Gist from Word Groups 113
 
To recognize prepositional phrases, remember that a prepositional 
phrase never appears alone as the subject of a sentence. These 
phrases aren’t the main topic of a sentence — they simply comple-
ment the important information.

Reading phrases
Exercise 7-2 helps you recognize the kind of phrases that you see 
in everyday reading. Get used to the idea of reading three-, four-, 
and five-word phrases like the kind you read in this exercise. Doing 
so greatly increases the number of words you can read per minute.
This exercise trains you to take in word groups rather than read 
word by word. It expands your peripheral vision so you can read 
word groups more easily and gets you in the habit of reading word 
groups. (For more on peripheral vision, head to Chapter 3.)
For this exercise, move a Cheat Sheet pacer down the page, read-
ing the phrases in Practice Text 7-2 as you go along. Try to take 
in each phrase with a single eye fixation without vocalizing. To 
help you do that, focus your eyes on the underlined words (where 
words are underlined). Repeat this exercise from time to time to 
maintain your reading in word group skills.

Finding other key phrases
In speech and writing, a phrase is a group of words that functions 
as a single unit in a sentence. For speed-reading purposes, a phrase 
is a natural word group that provides the context in a sentence. 
General phrases are a bit harder to recognize than prepositional 
phrases because you don’t necessarily have words such as at, by, 
from, on, and toward to clue you in. But if you can develop the abil-
ity to see phrases as you read, you can read that much faster.
Roughly speaking, phrases fall into these four groups:
 
✓ Adjectival phrase: A group of words that begins with an 
adjective and modifies a noun. Example: The day empty of all 
hope has arrived.
 
✓ Adverbial phrase: A group of words that functions like an 
adverb to modify the rest of the sentence. Example: I’ll wash 
the car when I’m good and ready.
 
✓ Noun phrase: A group of words that that begins with a noun 
or pronoun and, taken together, forms the subject or object 
of a sentence. Example: The day the horses were freed was a 
happy day.
 
✓ Verb phrase: A group of words that begins with a verb and 
modifies the subject or object of the sentence. Example: The 
runner crossed the finish line to take first place.
In the following sentences, I underline the phrases. Read the 
phrases in these sentences with a single eye fixation. With a bit 
of practice, you can recognize phrases in sentences, treat them 
as word groups, and devour them on the printed page in a single 
glance.
He was a distinguished gardener.
Teachers are the source of inspiration.
His life was a story based on faith.
The monthly report was submitted too late.
There was no drought for forty years.
The major cost was in the driveway.
That person has a basic business plan.
He plays tennis indoors.

 Chapter 7: Getting the Gist from Word Groups 119
Identifying the Most Important 
Word Groups: Thought Units
Generally speaking, a thought unit is a word group that expresses a 
complete thought or idea. Every sentence is composed of thought 
units because every sentence conveys at least one thought. If you 
can recognize the word groups that convey thought units, you can 
read these word groups in a single eye fixation and increase your 
reading comprehension greatly.
Thought units can be difficult to pick out in sentences because you 
can’t look for commas or other punctuation marks in a sentence 
for guidance in finding them. Instead, you have to develop the abil-
ity to quickly examine how the parts of a sentence fit together and 
locate the weightiest, or meatiest, part of the sentence. In this sen-
tence, for example, notice where the (italicized) thought units are:
A quick glance at the menu told us that, at this particular res-
taurant, on this particular evening, dinner would cost a fortune 
no matter what we ate and drank.
In the following sentences, I underline the thought units. Notice in 
these sentences that the thought unit is the part of the sentence 
that matters most. You can treat this part as a word group and 
read it quickly in a single glance.
This is the way to get to the second floor.
After finishing the paint job, the cleanup work began.
To fix the door, you have to first remove all the paint.
To win the game you must know the rules.
Running a marathon requires endurance and commitment.
Reading Word Groups to Increase 
Comprehension
Reading word groups has a benefit beyond increasing your reading 
speed: It also increases your comprehension.
When you read by jumping from word group to word group rather 
than from word to word, one group of words provides meaning to 
the next group. You don’t have to reread or consult a dictionary if 
you come across a word or phrase you don’t understand because 
the context and meaning of each sentence is more apparent when 
you read words in groups.

Part II: Focusing on the Fundamentals 
120
To understand why reading word groups increases your compre-
hension, consider the following sentences. In these sentences, you 
see words that you may not understand if you encounter them 
alone. However, the word groups that accompany these words 
give them meaning.
Unfortunately he was sent to the asylum because his mental 
state deteriorated.
My friend’s father was sent to the mortuary today; his funeral is 
set for tomorrow.
He loves to study the stars; he spends all his free time at the 
planetarium.
Prof. Jones’ pedagogy in teaching reading meets the highest 
standards of the art and science of teaching.
Myriad is a very misused word; “many” would frequently be a 
more accurate and better-understood substitute.
His dilatory habits caused every event in which he was part to 
start late.
You don’t have to stop your reading or open a dictionary to under-
stand these words because you can infer their meaning in context 
from the word groups. One group of words gives meaning to other 
groups. After you get in the habit of reading word groups, you 
read with confidence because you know that word groups provide 
meaning and context.
Exercise 7-3 demonstrates why reading one word at a time slows 
your reading. Move a Cheat Sheet pacer down the random non-
sense phrases in Practice Text 7-3, trying to read each group of 
words in one glance. You’ll get frustrated very quickly. Don’t worry 
about that; keep reading. Don’t look at individual words — try to 
catch the whole word group.

Tough, right? You have to pause and consider every word as you 
read these phrases because they don’t make sense — they have no 
context. You have to read slowly to understand what you’re read-
ing. Sometimes you even have to reread and skip backward over 
the line.

Part III

Speed-Reading Skills

In this part...
P
art III assumes you’re aware of the skills you need to be 
a speed reader, so it presents exercises that reinforce 
those abilities. Beyond that, it also digs into some refi ned 
comprehension skills such as skimming and scanning.
Chapter 8 helps you hone your speed-reading prowess 
with some challenging exercises. Chapter 9 tells you how 
to concentrate and read more aggressively, and Chapter 
10 looks at skimming, scanning, and prereading, skills 
useful to anyone who is in a hurry (and who isn’t?). In 
Chapter 11, I show you a couple of high-level skills for 
advanced speed readers, including how to follow the 
author’s thought patterns and go straight to the gist 
of the paragraph you’re reading.

Chapter 8
Building Your Speed-
Reading Momentum
In This Chapter
▶ Reading text in narrow and wide columns
▶ Identifying and reading word groups in the course of your reading
T
his chapter reinforces basic speed-reading techniques (see 
Part II). Practice, as they say, makes perfect, so this chapter 
includes several exercises you can use to hone your speed-reading 
skills and build momentum before tackling the more advanced 
techniques described in later chapters. You start with reading text 
in narrow columns and work your way to reading continuous text 
that isn’t in columns.
 
To help keep your speed-reading skills on point, revisit the exer-
cises in this chapter (and throughout the book) periodically to 
check your progress and stay in practice. Head to Chapter 16 for 
more tidbits on cementing your speed-reading abilities.
Reading Text in Narrow 
Column Clumps
As Chapter 6 explains, speed reading starts with reading clumps — 
collections of 4 to 16 words that you read in a single glance. A word 
clump consists of words that are next to each other on the page, 
nothing more and nothing less. In and of itself, a word clump doesn’t 
have any meaning, unlike word groups and phrases, which do convey 
meaning. (See Chapter 7 for more on word groups and phrases.)
Exercise 8-1 gives you practice in reading clumps. In the exercise, you 
read text that has been squeezed — I mean really squeezed — into 
narrow columns so you have no trouble locating clumps to read. 
As you read down the columns, take in all the words on each line at 

Part III: Advancing Your Speed-Reading Skills 
128
once. These word clumps only comprise four or five words at most, 
so you can read them at once. Bear down with all your concentration 
to read as fast as you can, keeping in mind that you have to answer 
comprehension questions when you’re done.
Follow these steps to complete Exercise 8-1:
 
1. Using a timer, read “Ferdinand Magellan” (Practice 
Text 8-1), taking in all the words in each line at once 
as you move down the columns.
 
 Keep your eyes fixated in the middle of the column so you 
can see all the words on each line.
 
2. After you finish reading the essay, note in the margin 
how long you take to read it.
 
 You’ll want this info for calculating your reading rates in 
Step 4.
 
3. Answer the comprehension questions.
 
 You should be able to answer at least four questions cor-
rectly. Answer fewer than that and you’re sacrificing com-
prehension for speed.
 
4. Calculate your words-per-minute (WPM) rate and effec-
tive reading rate (ERR) and enter them on the worksheet 
in Appendix B.
 
 Chapter 5 shows you how to calculate these rates.

Ferdinand Magellan
Courtesy of www.StrugglingReaders.com
In the early
sixteenth century, a
Portuguese noble, soldier,
and sailor named
Ferdinand Magellan performed
what has been
designated the greatest
single human achievement
on the sea.
Magellan had spent
long years in
Asia, and he
often gazed across
the wide expanse
of the Pacific
Ocean and asked
himself a question:
“How far away
from here are
the lands discovered
by Columbus? If 
I sailed to
the New World,
could I find 
a passage to
the Pacific Ocean
and the rich
Spice Islands?” Magellan
hoped to find
answers to his
questions as well
as obtain a
large cargo of
rare and costly
spices. When the
Portuguese king refused
to assist him,
he turned to
Spain for help.
On August 10, 1519,
Magellan sailed from
Seville, Spain with
five ships — the
Trinidad, San Antonio,
Concepcion, Victoria, and
Santiago — and a
crew of 237 sailors.
He navigated the
Atlantic, and when
he reached the
New World, he
followed the coast
of South America
until he found
the straits that
connected the two oceans.
He reached this
point on October 21.
It took Magellan
thirty-eight days
to sail through
the stormy straits
to the Pacific
Ocean, and during
that difficult time,
one ship was
wrecked and one
headed back to
Spain. Once in
the waters, which
Magellan named Mar Pacifico
(now the Pacific Ocean)
because of their
apparent stillness, Magellan
turned north and
traveled for months
without sighting land.
The voyage was
filled with extreme
hardship. At one
point several resentful
Spanish captains initiated
a rebellion against
their Portuguese admiral.
Magellan defeated the
(continued)

Part III: Advancing Your Speed-Reading Skills 
130
Practice Text 8-1 (continued)
rebels and left
two of them
on shore to
die. Several times
the ships ran
low on supplies,
and the sailors
begged to turn
back, but Magellan
would not allow
this. At one
point he declared
that they would
continue the voyage
even if they
had to eat
the leather rigging
of the ships.
Disease and starvation
claimed many of
the crew but,
mindful of the
fate of the
earlier rebels,
no one opposed
Magellan’s will.
Magellan finally reached 
the islands of 
the Pacific, the
Marianas and Guam,
in February of 1521,
but he was
unfortunately killed in
a skirmish with
some natives in
the Philippine Islands
on April 27, 1521.
The casualties suffered
in this battle
left the expedition
with not enough
men to sail the
remaining three ships.
On May 2, 
they abandoned the
Concepcion and burned
the ship. The
Basque navigator Juan
Sebastian Elcano
took over command
of the expedition,
consisting now only
of the ships
Trinidad and Victoria.
The crew had
over time loaded
the two boats
with a cargo
of valuable spices
and at this
point an attempt
was made to
return to Spain
by sailing westward.
But as they
left the Spice
Islands, the Trinidad
began to take on water.
The conclusion was
made that the
Trinidad needed to
spend time in 
port being repaired,
and because the
Victoria was not
large enough to
accommodate all of
the surviving crew,
only some boarded
the ship and
sailed for Spain.
A few weeks
later, the Trinidad,
now repaired, departed
and attempted to
take the same
westward route to
Spain. However, it
was captured by
the Portuguese and

 Chapter 8: Building Your Speed-Reading Momentum 131
Practice Text 8-1 (continued)
eventually wrecked while
at anchor under
Portuguese control.
The remaining vessel,
the Victoria, with
only 17 of
the original crew
members in addition
to Elcano, sailed
west through the
Indian Ocean and
around the southern
tip of Africa.
When they limped
into a Spanish
port on September 6, 1522,
they had been
gone three years
and one month.
Although Magellan did
not live to
see the conclusion
of the voyage,
he and his
crew circumnavigated, or
sailed around, the
world. Magellan would
never know that
he had proved
what Columbus had
correctly predicted, that
the lands of
the East could
be reached by
sailing west.

Reading Clump Text 
in Wider Columns
As a beginning speed reader, you can only read four- and five-word 
clumps, but with practice doing exercises like Exercise 8-2, you 
can soon jump to six-, seven-, eight-, and even nine- and ten-word 
clumps.
Exercise 8-2 stretches your horizontal reading vision a little. In 
this exercise, you read an essay laid out in two wide columns and 
answer some comprehension questions. Each column contains 
anywhere from five to eight words. In this exercise, I want you to 
treat those five to eight words as a clump and read them in one 
gulp.
To knock out Exercise 8-2, complete the following steps:
 
1. Using a timer, read “Obstacles Are the Stepping Stones of 
Success” (Practice Text 8-2), trying to take in the words in 
each line with a single glance.
 
 On each line, focus your eyes on the middle of the column 
and take in all the words to the left and right.
 
2. When you finish reading the essay, note in the margin 
how long you take to read it.
 
 You’ll want this info for calculating your reading rates in 
Step 4.
 
3. Answer the comprehension questions.
 
 If you’re comprehending what you read as well as speed 
reading the words, you should be able to answer at least 
four of the five questions.
 
4. On the worksheet in Appendix B, enter your WPM rate 
and ERR (see Chapter 5 for these formulas).

A man was walking in the park 
one day when he came upon 
a cocoon with a small opening. 
He sat and watched the butterfly 
for several hours as it struggled 
to force its body through the little hole. 
Then it seemed to stop making any progress. 
It looked like it had gotten 
as far as it could, 
so the man decided to help the butterfly. 
He used his pocketknife and snipped 
the remaining bit of the cocoon.
The butterfly then emerged easily, but 
something was strange. The butterfly 
had a swollen body and shriveled wings. 
The man continued to watch the butterfly 
because he expected at any moment 
the wings would enlarge and expand 
to be able to support the body, 
which would contract in time. 
Neither happened. In fact, the butterfly 
spent the rest of its life crawling around 
with a swollen body and deformed wings. 
It was never able to fly.
What the man in his kindness and haste 
did not understand was that

the restricting cocoon and the struggle 
required for the butterfly to emerge was natural. 
It was nature’s way of forcing fluid 
from its body into its wings 
so that it would be ready for flight 
once it achieved its freedom. 
Sometimes struggles are exactly what 
we need in our lives.
If we were allowed to go through life 
without any obstacles, we would be crippled. 
We would not be as strong as 
what we could have been. 
And we could never fly.
History has shown us that 
the most celebrated winners usually 
encountered heartbreaking obstacles before they triumphed. 
They won because they refused 
to become discouraged by their defeats.
My good friend, Lou Holtz, 
football coach of the University of South Carolina, 
once told me, “Show me someone who 
has done something worthwhile, and I’ll show you 
someone who has overcome adversity.”
Beethoven composed his greatest works after becoming deaf. 
George Washington was snowed in 
through a treacherous winter at Valley Forge. 
Abraham Lincoln was raised in poverty. 
Albert Einstein was called a

no one could have blamed him, 
considering the constant adversity he endured.
As an elementary student, actor 
James Earl Jones (a.k.a. Darth Vader) 
stuttered so badly he communicated 
with friends and teachers using written notes.
Itzhak Perlman, the incomparable concert violinist, 
was born to parents who survived 
a Nazi concentration camp and 
has been paralyzed from the 
waist down since the age of four.
Chester Carlson, a young inventor, took his idea 
to 20 big corporations in the 1940s. 
After seven years of rejections, 
he was able to persuade Haloid, 
a small company in Rochester, N.Y., 
to purchase the rights to 
his electrostatic paper-copying process. 
Haloid has since become Xerox Corporation.
Thomas Edison tried over 2,000 experiments 
before he was able to 
get his light bulb to work. 
Upon being asked how he felt 
about failing so many times, he replied, 
“I never failed once. I invented the light bulb. 
It just happened to be a 2,000-step process.”
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, elected President of the United States 
for four terms, had been stricken

Academy Award-winning writer, producer and director 
Woody Allen failed motion picture production

Identifying Word Groups 
in Continuous Text
Chapter 7 details how a word group is basically a sophisticated clump. 
Where a clump is just several words run together on the page, a word 
group is a phrase or thought that carries meaning. If you can master 
the art of recognizing word groups as you read and read each word 
group in one go, you can become a much faster reader.
The purpose of Exercise 8-3 is to help you get in the habit of seeing 
word groups as you read continuous text. (If you haven’t already 
taken a look at Chapters 7 and 11, you may want to check out their 
discussions on recognizing word groups, phrases, and thought 
groups before doing this exercise.) In the exercise, you underline 
word groups so you can get practice in identifying them. You also 
answer five comprehension questions to make sure you under-
stand what you read instead of just flying through it.
Note: Obviously, the fact that you carefully review the practice 
text in the course of underlining will help improve your reading 
speed as well; after all, you will have already read it to some extent 
once before you officially read it for speed. However, that little bit 
of extra familiarity isn’t enough to improve your speed as much 
as reading for word groups does. So grab a pencil and dive into 
Exercise 8-3 (although maybe you’d better step lightly instead; you 
are holding a pencil):
 
1. Read the essay “Culture” (Practice Text 8-3), underlining 
the word groups as you read.
 
 To help you get started, I’ve underlined the word groups in 
the first paragraph of the essay. Don’t worry about whether 
you underline the right word; there’s no strict definition of 
what constitutes a word group. The point is to get in the 
habit of seeing and recognizing words groups in the course 
of your reading.
 
2. When you finish underlining the word groups, get out 
your timer and read the essay word group by word 
group.
 
 You underlined the word groups, so you shouldn’t have 
any trouble finding them. Read each underlined word 
group in a single glance if you can.
 
3. After you finish reading the essay, jot down your reading 
time in the margin.
 
 This info helps you calculate your reading rates in Step 5.

Part III: Advancing Your Speed-Reading Skills

4. Answer the comprehension questions.
 
 You should be able to answer at least four of five questions 
correctly if you’re reading for comprehension as well as 
speed.
 
5. In the Appendix B worksheet, enter your WPM rate and 
ERR for Exercise 8-3.
The better you are at recognizing word groups in the course of 
your reading, the faster you can read.

Culture
Courtesy of www.StrugglingReaders.com
When you think of a culture, you usually think of things such 
as art, language, music, literature, and architecture. But a cul-
ture is much more. It is a way of life, simple or complex.
Every society or group of people has a culture. The culture 
includes a mixture of art, language, music, literature, and archi-
tecture. But it also includes customs, traditions, and beliefs 
that are important to the groups within families, neighbor-
hoods, communities, and governments.
Cultures result from basic needs shared by all people. Early 
culture was a way to extend the ability to obtain food, seek 
protection, and raise and nurture children. Today’s culture has 
modern methods of getting food and developing shelter. It has 
a means of distributing the food and other goods to its people. 
The culture includes family relationships, community relation-
ships, education opportunities, religious practices, and forms 
of artistic expression.
All large cities and many small cities have history, science, and 
art centers, and museums. People attend dance performances, 
plays, musicals, and classical and popular music concerts. 
They can view outdoor art projects and important architecture. 
This development of artistic expression forms is the result of 
both contributions by private giving and other funding.
A country’s culture has systems for giving power and respon-
sibility, including social positions, education, economics, and 
governments. Giving power and responsibility is a way to keep 
order and settle disputes.

 Chapter 8: Building Your Speed-Reading Momentum 141
In more complex cultures, this includes police, court, and 
prison systems. The country’s structure, its laws, and the way 
people relate to each other have great influence on people’s 
actions and attitudes.
People learn their culture by growing up in a particular soci-
ety or group. They are not born with a culture. They learn it 
mainly through the use of language and by watching and imi-
tating other group members. By seeing what goes on around 
then, they learn what their society considers right and wrong.
By listening to group members’ shared memories, beliefs, 
values, and expectations, they develop ways of thinking. Most 
cultural learning comes from verbal communication. Children 
share their culture’s traditions of citizenship, holiday celebra-
tion, craftsmanship, production, competition, leadership, 
know-how, and positive attitude.
To learn about a group’s culture, ask questions as “What lan-
guages do the group’s members speak? How do group mem-
bers decide what is right or wrong? What customs do group 
members share?”
Customs are an important feature of a culture — they’re a way 
of doing things that has been handed down from one genera-
tion to the next. Customs include greeting traditions, eating 
traditions, and holiday traditions. Every culture has a cus-
tomary way of greeting, of eating, and of celebrating holidays 
and special days. The adventure of fireworks displays on the 
Fourth of July has become an American custom.
Through travel, television, films, and other means, people 
become familiar with cultures from around the world. And 
cultural traits spread around the world. Clothing, music, 
sports, and industrial processes are the same in many places 
of the world.
Blue jeans are a good example of a spreading cultural trait. 
Clothing from one culture, American, is worn around the 
world. Blue jeans became popular as work clothes in the 
1850s after Levi Strauss, a German immigrant merchant in San 
Francisco, created them. Now they are widely worn on every 
continent by people of all ages and fashion tastes.
A culture is much more than art, language, music, literature, 
and architecture. It is a way to enhance the lives of people.

Reading Word Groups 
in Continuous Text
Exercise 8-4 challenges you to recognize and identify word groups 
in the course of your reading. As each word group appears before 
your eyes, you see it, read it, and comprehend it. With a bit of 
practice you can become adept at seeing word groups in text in 
the same way that you see different colors in a painting.
Unlike Exercise 8-3 in the previous section, you don’t identify the 
word groups ahead of time; you do it as you read. Developing the 
ability to see and comprehend word groups on the fly helps you 
become a better speed reader. Follow these steps to complete 
Exercise 8-4, keeping in mind that you answer comprehension 
questions at the end:
 
1. Using a timer, read “Psychology” (Practice Text 8-4) word 
group by word group.
 
 Do your very best to read word group by word group, not 
clump by clump (and especially not word by word). If you 
focus hard enough, the word groups will stick out, and 
you’ll be able to identify them.
 
2. Write down in the margin how long you take to read the 
essay.
 
 Your reading time helps determine your reading rates in 
Step 4.
 
3. Answer the comprehension questions.
 
 As long as you’re not sacrificing speed for comprehension, you 
should be able to answer at least four questions correctly.
 
4. In Appendix B, enter your WPM rate and ERR for 
Exercise 8-4.

Psychology

Psychology is the scientific study of behavior and the mind. It 
is a popular subject with many fascinating features.
The word psychology comes from the Greek words psyche, 
meaning mind or soul, and logia, meaning study. Since ancient 
times, people have been interested in why human beings and

other animals behave as they do. The origins of psychology are 
often traced to the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle, whose 
main interest was in what the human mind can accomplish.
Psychologists seek answers to a wide range of human behav-
iors such as: How do our brains learn and remember? How 
does the mind affect the body? (One answer for this behavior 
is that some people are able to change their heart rates and 
body temperatures just by thinking about doing so.) What 
about personality differences in people? Why are some people 
bashful and some not shy at all? What causes violence? How 
can violence be stopped?
Psychological research is applied to a wide range of human activ-
ity related to everyday life, such as family, education, employ-
ment, and mental health. Psychology is a broad and diverse 
field and includes areas such as human development, cognitive 
development (the mental processing of information), and others. 
More than any other part of the human body, the brain raises 
questions that psychologists are searching to answer.
A number of different specialty areas in psychology have 
emerged. One of these is sports psychology, which deals with 
increasing athletic performance A sport psychologist may 
work with individual athletes or team athletes to improve per-
formance levels. Some of the most important skills taught are 
goal setting, relaxation, visualization, awareness and control, 
concentration, and confidence.
Some sport psychologists also work in the fitness industry to 
design exercise programs that enhance participation and pro-
mote psychological well-being.
Psychologists use scientific methods to test their ideas. Three 
methods are often used in psychological research.
The first method is naturalistic observation, observing the 
behavior of human beings and other animals in their natural 
environments. Here is an example of naturalistic observation. 
The study of parent-child interaction may involve videotap-
ing the parent and child in their home either as they go about 
their daily routine or as they perform an activity given to them 
by the researcher. The videotaped interactions can then be 
analyzed to learn information from them.
The second method is systematic assessment that identifies 
and examines people’s thoughts, feelings, and personality 
traits with case histories, surveys and standardized tests. 
Things such as intelligence and reading ability can be mea-
sured through standardized tests.
Practice Text 8-4 (continued)

 Chapter 8: Building Your Speed-Reading Momentum 145
The third method uses experimentation to discover or confirm 
cause and effect relationships. It enables a scientist to test a 
theory under controlled conditions. To demonstrate a cause 
and effect, an experiment must often show that, for example, 
if something occurs after a certain treatment is given to a 
subject, the same thing should not occur in the absence of the 
treatment.
Psychology is closely related to the natural science of biol-
ogy and the social sciences of sociology and anthropology 
that deal with people in society. Social sciences study the 
attitudes and relationships of human beings in social settings. 
Psychology is similar to a medical field called psychiatry; 
however, psychiatrists have medical degrees and usually 
focus on treating mental disorders.
Research findings in psychology have greatly increased the 
possibility of understanding why people behave as they do. 
They have provided valuable insights into helping people 
function better individually and as a group or society. 
Psychological research and experimentation are fascinating, 
but how people actually benefit from the findings is the true 
measure of success.

Exercising Your Ability to 
Read More in Even Less Time
In This Chapter
▶ Keeping vocalization to a minimum
▶ Expanding your reading vision
▶ Reading with heightened concentration
▶ Reading aggressively
T
his chapter puts you to the test by presenting four unique 
speed-reading exercises designed to help you hone your 
speed-reading skills: avoiding vocalizing, expanding your vision 
span, concentrating harder, and reading aggressively.
Introducing Push-Down and 
Push-Up Exercises
My company, The Literacy Company, created push-down and push-
up exercises to reinforce essential speed-reading skills.
 
✓ Push-down exercises: You read the same material multiple 
times, trying to read the same amount of material in less time 
each go-around. After each reading, you also answer who, 
what, where, and when questions, which demonstrate how 
comprehension, retention, and recall improve at each subse-
quent reading. (And there’s nothing like the threat — I mean 
promise — of a quiz to encourage you to pay attention to the 
material instead of speed-skimming it.)
 
✓ Push-up exercises: You read the same material multiple times 
for the same amount of time, trying to read farther and farther in 
that allotted time each go-around. This exercise demonstrates 
how the familiarity with text and vocabulary increases reading 
speed.

Part III: Advancing Your Speed-Reading Skills 
148
Push-down and push-up exercises really challenge you to bear 
down and apply all your speed-reading skills. They also give you 
a chance to realistically measure how much faster you can read if 
you put your heart and mind into it.
Getting More from What You Read: 
Push-Down Exercises
The exercises in this section are designed to reinforce two essen-
tial speed-reading skills: not vocalizing and expanding your vision 
span. I would argue that these are actually the two most essential 
speed-reading skills. Master these two skills and you are well on 
your way to becoming a speed reader.
Focusing on your silent reading
The first goal of anybody who wants to be a speed reader is to cut 
down or eliminate vocalization (the bad habit of saying and hearing 
words when you read — check out Chapter 2 for more). Vocalizing 
keeps you from reading fast because it takes much longer to see, 
hear, and process words than it takes to just see and process them.
In Exercise 9-1, you read an essay called “The Incredible Brain” 
twice. As you read, try to read in complete silence without your 
inner voice making a peep.
 
You may even try reading this essay while chewing gum or with a 
pencil between your lips. Keeping your mouth and lips busy while 
you read can help stifle, perhaps even silence, your inner reading 
voice.
Follow these steps to complete the first half of Exercise 9-1:
 
1. Using a timer, read as much of “The Incredible Brain” 
(Practice Text 9-1) as you can in 60 seconds (remember-
ing not to vocalize as you read).
 
 If you hear your inner reading voice, imagine a volume 
switch next to your right ear and turn the volume all the 
way down.
 
2. When the 60 seconds have elapsed, circle the last word 
you read.
 
3. On the worksheet in Appendix B, write down the line 
number of the circled word.
 
 For example, if the word you circled is in line 35, enter 35 
on the Appendix B worksheet.

The Incredible Brain
Courtesy of www.StrugglingReaders.com
Human beings have the most highly developed brains of any 
living creatures. More powerful than the most advanced super-
computer, the human brain makes it possible for a person to 
live, speak, solve problems, make and enjoy music, and create 
through thoughts and ideas.
The brain is the body’s control center. It constantly receives 
information about conditions both inside and outside the 
body. It rapidly analyzes the information and then sends out 
messages that control bodily functions and actions.
Three main parts or areas make up the brain: brain stem, cer-
ebellum, and cerebrum. The brain stem is at the bottom of the 
brain and controls the body’s automatic processes, such as 
breathing, heartbeat, and body temperature. The cerebellum 
lies at the back of the brain. It is the part of the brain that coor-
dinates balance, posture, and movements. The cerebrum is 
the center of all thought and includes about 90 percent of the 
human brain.
The cerebrum is divided into two halves called hemispheres. 
Each hemisphere is responsible for specific functions. In 
general, the left cerebral hemisphere is involved with mathe-
matics, language, and logical thinking. The right cerebral hemi-
sphere includes feelings, musical ability, and visual thinking. 
While each hemisphere has specific functions, the two hemi-
spheres are thought to also process information together. For 
example, while the left hemisphere processes the meanings of 
words, the right hemisphere processes the emotions related 
to the words. In most human beings that are right handed, it is 
the left hemisphere that usually contains the specialized lan-
guage areas. About 20 percent of left-handed people have their 
language areas in the right hemisphere.
The human brain is a gray-colored organ. Its jelly-like mass 
has many grooves and ridges on its surface. An infant’s brain 
weighs less than one pound. By the time a child is six years 
old, the brain has reached its full weight of approximately 
three pounds. During the six-year growth period, a child learns 
and acquires information at the fastest rate in his or her life.
Although the brain reaches its full weight by six years old, 
some parts of the brain do not fully develop until after the 
teenage years. An environment that stimulates learning actu-
ally builds important networks in the brains of young learners.

It was once believed that as one aged, the brain’s networks 
became fixed, like plastic hardening. In the past twenty years, 
however, an enormous amount of research has revealed that 
the brain never stops changing and adjusting. Therefore, 
throughout life, while reading, studying, and learning, new 
brain networks are being built.
Proper brain development and functioning also depend on 
good nutrition. Eating a good diet and drinking adequate water 
is important for brain development and function. The brain is 
about 80 percent water. Even slight dehydration can damage 
the brain over time. Exercise is also important for brain devel-
opment and functioning.
The brain works like a computer and a chemical factory. Brain 
cells produce electrical signals and send them from cell to cell 
along pathways called circuits. As in a computer, these cir-
cuits receive, process, store, and retrieve information. Unlike 
a computer, the brain creates its electrical signals by chemical 
means. The brain depends on many complicated chemical sub-
stances working together simultaneously.
Among the many interesting facts about the human brain are 
that the brain does not feel pain because it has no pain recep-
tors and that women have about ten percent more of the brain 
cells called neurons than men do.
Human brains are the most highly developed brains, more 
powerful than computers. Research continues to discover 
amazing information about the incredible human brain.
In the second half of Exercise 9-1, I ask you to answer some com-
prehension questions. Although I want you to read fast, don’t sacri-
fice comprehension for speed. Follow these steps to complete the 
second half of Exercise 9-1:
 
1. Using a timer, start reading the essay again, and read as 
far as you can in 50 seconds, striving to get at least to the 
same line you got to previously.
 
 Double your efforts to read silently. You’ll likely read faster 
this time because you’ve already read most of this essay 
and you’re familiar with the subject matter, but if you don’t 
read faster, don’t blame yourself. Blame the clock — it 
always ticks faster when you’re trying to go faster.
 
2. Draw a square around the last word you read when 
the 50 seconds expire and record the line number in 
Appendix B.

 I want you to answer the comprehension questions to make 
sure you’re reading for comprehension as well as speed. 
You should be able to answer four out of five questions 
correctly. If your score is lower than that, focus more on 
concentration in your next reading test. Pretend that the

Spreading your vision span 
even wider
Another key to being a speed reader is to widen your vision span, 
or how many words you take in at a time. As you read, your eyes 
move across the page, fixating on single words or groups of words. 
To improve your reading speed, you need to take in more words 
with each glance or eye fixation (check out Chapter 3 for more on 
eye fixations). Exercise 9-2 builds on the exercise in the previous 
section by training you to use a widened vision span to reach your 
reading goals in less time.
In Exercise 9-2, you read an essay called “Lewis and Clark” twice. 
Focus on reading more than one word at a time. (For more information 
on taking in multiple words in one glance, check out the Chapter 6 
discussion on reading word clumps and the Chapter 7 discussion 
about recognizing and reading word groups with a single eye fixation.)
Follow these steps to complete the first half of Exercise 9-2:
 
1. Using a timer, read “Lewis and Clark” (Practice Text 9-2) 
for 60 seconds, trying to take in word groups in a single 
glance.
 
 For example, the first words in the essay, “In April 1803, 
President Thomas Jefferson,” are a word group. You can 
read much more quickly if you take in word groups like this 
with a single eye fixation.
 
2. When the 60 seconds have passed, circle the last word 
you read and record its line number on the worksheet in 
Appendix B.

Lewis and Clark
Courtesy of www.StrugglingReaders.com
In April 1803, President Thomas Jefferson purchased the entire 
area of Louisiana from France. The territory stretched from 
the Mississippi River to the middle of the Rocky Mountains, 
but no one was really sure where the Mississippi River started 
or where exactly the Rocky Mountains were located. In June 
of 1803, Meriwether Lewis was commissioned by Jefferson to 
find answers to some of the many questions that people had 
regarding the new purchase. Captain Lewis selected William 
Clark as his partner in the exploration. They were to explore 
the area and describe the land and its human and animal 
inhabitants.

During the winter of 1803-1804, recruitment and training were 
undertaken at Camp Dubois, Illinois Territory. Located near 
present-day Hartford, Illinois, Camp Dubois was the begin-
ning point of the journey, where, on May 14, 1804, Lewis and 
Clark departed with 33 men who comprised the “Permanent 
Party” of the expedition and sufficient supplies for two years. 
Supplies included a ton of dried pork, seven buckets of salt, 
and medicines for all the men of the expedition. They paddled 
up the Missouri River in canoes and met with Lewis in Saint 
Charles, Missouri.
The expedition continued up the Missouri westward and met 
and traded with a variety of Native American tribes. In August 
of 1804, the Corps of Discovery, the official name of the expedi-
tion, suffered its only death when Sergeant Charles Floyd died 
of acute appendicitis. With the coming of winter, the party 
built Fort Mandan near Washburn, North Dakota. It was here 
that they became acquainted with a sixteen-year-old Indian 
woman and adopted her as their primary guide. Her name was 
Sacagawea, which means “bird woman.” She was the wife of a 
French-Canadian fur trapper named Toussaint Charbonneau 
that Lewis And Clark employed during their winter stay at Fort 
Mandan.
When the ice melted, they continued on their journey. All 
along the way, Lewis and Clark drew maps and diagrams 
and recorded what they observed in meticulous detail. They 
encountered Native American leaders, told them about the 
United States, and presented them with medals and American 
flags from the president. They acquired knowledge about soil 
and weather conditions and investigated fur trading possibili-
ties. After seven months of difficult travel, they reached the 
Rocky Mountains.
Thanks to Sacagawea’s influence, Lewis and Clark obtained 
horses from the Native Americans. Their intention was to 
cross the Rockies with the Pacific Ocean as their final destina-
tion. The weather grew cold, the food became scarce, and the 
mountains seemed endless.
When they finally arrived at the ocean in December of 1805, 
Clark wrote in his journal, “The ocean is in view! Oh, what joy!” 
The expedition spent the winter at Fort Caltsop, which they 
built to prepare provisions for their trip home. They hunted 
wildlife, spent time with more of the over 36 tribes that they 
would encounter during their more than two-year journey.

When the expedition finally returned home over two years 
and four months after they began their journey, they were 
awarded a tumultuous welcome. People had long since given 
them up for dead. That welcome was well deserved. During the 
long and arduous voyage, Lewis and Clark had accomplished 
an outstanding feat in describing the land, the rivers, and the 
Native American inhabitants.
Their perception of the geography of the Northwest allowed 
them to fill in details of previously unknown areas of the north-
western United States. They prepared nearly 140 maps during 
the entire journey. Their trip also documented over 100 spe-
cies of animals and nearly 176 species of native plants. Their 
contribution to the knowledge of this area was incalculable. 
They had proven that there was a way to reach the Pacific and 
had opened a huge new area for settlement and trade. Many 
other Americans would soon follow in their footsteps.
Heads up: In the second half of Exercise 9-2, I ask you to answer 
some comprehension questions, so read for meaning as well as 
speed. The following steps show you how to complete the second 
half of Exercise 9-2:
 
1. Using your timer, read the essay again, reading as far as 
you can in 50 seconds with the goal of reaching at least 
your previous stopping point.
 
 On this reading, you’re more aware of word groups 
because you read the essay already.
 
2. Draw a square around the last word you read when the 
50 seconds expired and enter its line number in the 
Appendix B worksheet.
 
 If you didn’t make it past your previous stopping point, 
don’t sweat it. Just try harder next time. In speed reading, 
you always have to try, try, try again.
 
3. Answer the following comprehension questions.
 
 You should be able to answer four out of five questions 
correctly. If you score lower than that, work on your com-
prehension as well as your reading speed. You may have to 
slow down a bit to improve your comprehension, but that’s 
okay. Comprehension is the goal of any reading activity, 
isn’t it?

Advancing Your Reading Limit: 
Push-Up Exercises
The exercises in this section reinforce two essential speed-reading 
skills: concentrating harder and reading aggressively. Speed read-
ing is more than a set of techniques — it’s also a mindset. You 
plunge ahead, confident that you can read quickly and compre-
hend at a heightened speed. These exercises help put you in that 
speed-reading mindset.
Reading aggressively 
without regressing
Above and beyond technique, speed reading is a state of mind in 
which you read more aggressively. Speed readers gallop across the 
page; they’re confident readers who forge ahead without regress-
ing, or going back over the material to check understanding. (Head 
to Chapter 2 for more on regression.) When you do the exercises in 
this section, I want you to flex your reading muscles. I want you to 
see whether you can adopt the aggressive reading mindset.
 
Reading aggressively takes work — it can be fatiguing. But you 
have to build up your stamina and be an aggressive reader if you 
really want to increase your reading speed.
Exercise 9-3 helps you become a more aggressive reader. Read 
the essay “Volunteerism: You Often Receive More than You Give” 
three times. On each subsequent reading, try to read more words 
than you did the time before — try to read more aggressively.
Follow these steps to complete the first half of Exercise 9-3:
 
1. Using a timer, read as much of the essay “Volunteerism: 
You Often Receive More than You Give” (Practice Text 9-3) 
in your normal reading mode as you can in 60 seconds.
 
2. Circle the last word you read when the 60 seconds expire 
and note its line number.
 
3. Reset the timer for 60 seconds and reread the essay 
aggressively, trying to read farther than you did in 
Step 1.
 
 Read as if your life depends on it.

Volunteerism: You Often Receive More than You Give 
by Harvey Mackay, nationally syndicated columnist
Originally published June 17, 2006
You don’t have to pledge Skull and Bones or be a country club 
deb to meet the right people. There are a ton of jobs that offer 
that opportunity but go begging every year for want of volun-
teers willing to take them.
Take ushering at your church or synagogue. Maybe it sounds 
like it’s just one step ahead of stoking the boilers, but it’s one 
of the most important jobs around the place. It only takes an 
hour a week, and there’s no heavy lifting. You can look on it 
as a “poor man’s finishing school.” It will help you overcome 
any innate shyness you may have about meeting and greeting 
strangers, and if you do it properly, you’ll really enjoy it.
Smart leaders of growing congregations make sure they have 
an ushering crew that stands tall. The ushers set the tone. Is it 
a friendly place with a warm welcome or an ingrown deal with 
very little to offer newcomers?
The Reverend James Kennedy, pastor of the well-known Coral 
Ridge Presbyterian Church in Fort Lauderdale, has a church 
that attracts a tremendous number of visitors. The ushers at 
Coral Ridge are instructed to be certain everyone is welcomed 
by at least two or three people and told they “were glad you 
came to worship with us today.” The church benefits greatly 
from these volunteers, but so do the individual ushers who 
become polished ambassadors for their congregation.
Getting active in an organization can help you in areas where 
you may be weak. Afraid to speak in front of a group? You 
won’t be toast if you join Toastmasters. I did, and I can tell you 
that the basics I learned in this organization are the primary 
reasons for any success I’ve had as a public speaker.
Also, Toastmasters helps you develop:
 
• self-esteem,
 
• assertiveness,
 
• confidence, and
 
• leadership.
Because volunteerism almost always includes fund-raising, you 
have an unusual opportunity to hone your selling skills. You 
will get a ton of no’s but what better way to receive on-the-job 
training than on someone else’s payroll.

When you do volunteer work, you can learn how to run a meet-
ing, prepare reports, serve on committees, supervise others, and 
a thousand other skills that can help you in your own career. 
Sometimes, it’s impossible to learn these things on the job.
Most of the people who sign up for these volunteer chores stay 
active for decades. Here’s an opportunity to learn teamwork 
and have the satisfaction of providing a vital service. You’ll 
make new friends, and you’ll be able to develop other contacts 
within the community itself.
Sometimes the rewards of volunteering are unexpected.
Will was a pretty fair high school athlete, but he dropped out 
of college before he could make any mark in athletics. He loved 
hockey and despite a career of mostly lower level blue collar 
jobs, he found enough time to coach kid hockey teams. Most 
of his friends thought he was crazy to spend so much time 
coaching for nothing when he didn’t have two quarters to rub 
together.
However, one of the contacts he made with his coaching really 
paid off, and today Will has a job he never dreamed he could 
get . . . sales manager for a well-respected paper company.
Sometimes, the only rewards for volunteering are the satisfac-
tion of doing a thankless job well. But sometimes, there is a 
personal payoff, and it can come in surprising ways.
Follow these steps to complete the second half of Exercise 9-3:
 
1. Reset the timer for 60 seconds and reread the essay 
aggressively, trying to read farther than you did previ-
ously.
 
 Read as if your life depended on it.
 
2. Draw a square around the last word you read when the 
60 seconds expired and note its line number.
 
 Did you read farther? Significantly farther? If you didn’t, 
think about how you can read more aggressively in the 
future. Try to focus harder when you read and make this 
your primary speed-reading goal.
 
3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2, attacking the essay a third time and 
drawing a triangle around the last word you read.
 
 I suspect you were able to read more words on each 
subsequent reading.

Improving your concentration
In many ways, speed reading is just the act of reading with a 
deeper level of concentration and efficiency. You have to concen-
trate harder when you speed read because you do several things 
at once in the act of speed reading:
 
✓ You consciously try to read several words at the same time.
 
✓ You try to detect and read word groups with a single eye 
fixation.
 
✓ You do your best to keep from vocalizing.
Exercise 9-4 is designed to help you be aware of how well you con-
centrate when you speed read by requiring you to read an essay 
multiple times with ever-increasing degrees of concentration.
Follow these steps to complete the first half of Exercise 9-4:
 
1. Using a timer, read as much of the essay “Transportation” 
(Practice Text 9-4) as you can in 60 seconds.
 
 Bear down and really concentrate on the words. Pretend 
that the essay is the only thing in the world and it deserves 
all of your attention.
 
2. Circle the last word you read when the 60 seconds 
elapsed, and note its line number.
 
 In your next reading, you try to read 25 percent more text 
in the allotted minute.
 
3. Calculate what line you have to reach to read 25 percent 
more text, and draw a square around that line.
 
 Divide the line number you circled in Step 2 by four and 
then add that result to the circled line number. For exam-
ple, if you read to line 60, you take 60 ÷ 4 (which equals 15) 
and then add 15 to the original 60 to get your new goal of 
75 lines. You can round up or down if you end up with a 
decimal target (like line 66.25).
 
 If you have decent math skills or a handy calculator, just 
multiply the Step 2 line number by 1.25 to quickly deter-
mine your new goal line.

Transportation
Courtesy of www.StrugglingReaders.com
Transportation, the act of carrying people and goods from one 
place to another, has made great gains since early civilization.
In early civilization, transportation developed slowly. 
Throughout most of the prehistoric period, people traveled 
mainly on foot. They had no wheeled vehicles or roads. Some 
scientists believe that wheeled carts appeared around 3500 B.C. 
in Mesopotamia, a region of the Middle East. As civilizations 
developed, the need for better forms of transportation grew.
Water transportation in the form of ships and barges devel-
oped more quickly than land transportation. Most of the 
world’s trade was by sea. In the 1700s, the first practical steam 
engine was invented. This led to the steamship, and in the 
1820s, to railroad transportation.
In the 1860s, the railroad expanded quickly across the United 
States to serve industries and growing cities. As part of the 
industrialization of the United States, a vast network of rail-
roads connected the United States from coast to coast. This 
was the transcontinental rail system, for the transport of 
people and goods.
The evolution of modern land transportation began in Europe 
and the United States in the late 1800s with the introduction of 
electric trains and streetcars. Then two inventions led to modern 
automobiles: the pneumatic, air-filled tire and the internal com-
bustion engine. At first few people could afford automobiles; 
however, during the 1920s, mass production of automobiles on 
assembly lines made them affordable to a greater segment of the 
population. Automobiles became the chief means of passenger 
transportation in the United States during the 1920s.
The automobile signaled the end of railroads as the main trans-
portation for people. It began an era of mobility in the United 
States that added greatly to its economic output. In the 1950s, 
the United States built a network of highways to link its vast 
territory. Today, there are well-maintained interstate highways 
that run from state to state. People can drive continuously 
from coast to coast, or from Canada and Mexico, and to most 
locations in between. Today, most short-distance travel of 
people and goods is by road. Some long distance travel is also 
by road, but most long distance travel is by air and sea.
Automobiles consume over half the energy used for trans-
portation in the United States. They contribute heavily to the

nation’s energy supply problems and to pollution. In some 
large cities major roads are packed with people during rush 
hour, the morning and evening hours when most people are 
going to and returning from work.
To help transport the great numbers of people, most large cities 
have some form of public transportation such as bus lines, sub-
ways, or commuter trains. People also ride together in car pools.
In an effort to find a solution to energy and environmental con-
cerns, experimentation began with hybrid and electric pow-
ered automobiles. In 2000, the first hybrid automobiles became 
available to the public. These automobiles now get close to 
50 miles per gallon of gas and emit much less pollution. Major 
auto manufacturers expect to be selling plug-in electric auto-
mobiles in the United States by 2010.
Here are some interesting facts about cars. One of the smallest 
cars ever built was only 4 feet and 4 inches long and had no 
reverse gear. One American limousine is equipped with a swim-
ming pool and a helicopter landing pad. A flying car is now in 
production. It is designed to be used as a car and a plane.
Transportation has made significant progress since early civili-
zation, With accommodation for the expanding population and 
for the fragile environment, the progress will continue.
I ask you to complete some comprehension questions after com-
pleting the second half of Exercise 9-4. Be sure to read for meaning 
as well as speed. Follow these steps to complete the second half of 
Exercise 9-4:
 
1. Using a timer, read the essay again and strive to read to 
your new goal line.
 
 This time, concentrate even harder. Did you make your 
goal of reading 25 percent more text? If not, try reading the 
essay a third time, and really focus this time to reach your 
goal.
 
2. Answer the following comprehension questions.
 
 I want you to answer these questions to make sure you 
don’t sacrifice reading comprehension for reading speed. 
After all, the primary goal of reading is to comprehend, not 
to go fast. You should get at least four out of five answers 
right on the test. If you answer fewer than four questions 
correctly, you’re putting too much emphasis on speed and 
not enough on comprehension. Focus more on your com-
prehension as you read.

E. All of the above
 
F. None of the above

Part III: Advancing Your Speed-Reading Skills 
166
The correct answer is E. Skimming, scanning, and prereading, are 
strategies for supplementing your speed reading. They give you 
a solid notion of what you’re reading and they help you locate 
the parts of the text that are worth reading. In the case of skim-
ming and prereading, you familiarize yourself the text. When you 
return to the text and speed read it, that familiarity with the text 
increases your comprehension. Skimming and prereading are a bit 
like studying a map of an area you want to explore. You get the lay 
of the land so you can get more out of your explorations when you 
undertake them.
The following sections give you brief descriptions of skimming, 
scanning, and prereading. All the methods are described in more 
detail later in this chapter.
Skimming for the main ideas
When you skim a page, you take the main ideas from the reading 
material without reading all the words. You look for and seize upon 
words that appear to give the main meaning. If you’re a newspaper 
reader, you already know what skimming is — you skim the head-
lines of the newspaper to decide which articles to read.
Readers skim when time is short or when they need to understand 
the general ideas but not the particulars of an article or book. 
Skimming occurs at three to four times the normal reading speed. 
For that reason, your reading comprehension takes a nose dive 
when you skim.
Skimming strategies include reading the first and last sentences of 
paragraphs, reading headings and subheadings, and studying tables 
and charts (and their captions). Later in this chapter, “Discovering 
the Art of Skimming” offers more detail on skimming strategies.
 
Studies show that people read and comprehend text on a computer 
screen more slowly than they read and comprehend printed mate-
rial. Readers can’t skim as efficiently on their computer screens 
either. When you read or skim a Web page on your computer, do so 
more slowly than usual if you want to read and skim efficiently.
Scanning for specific words 
or phrases
Scanning is quickly scouring the text for specific information; 
unlike skimming, you’re not concerned with the broader meaning 
of the text. Scanning involves moving your eyes quickly down the 

 Chapter 10: Other Reading Strategies . . . 167
page seeking specific words or phrases. It’s the same technique 
you use when you look up a word in a telephone book or diction-
ary — you already know what you’re looking for, and you concen-
trate on finding the word that provides the answer to your search.
Scan when you want to take one or two tidbits of information from 
a book or article. For example, to locate information about the 
California gold rush in an article about California history, you scan 
for the words 1849 or gold rush. After you find these words, you 
skim or carefully read only the part of the article where the words 
are located.
 
Obviously, your reading comprehension drops to just about noth-
ing when you scan. Because you don’t read for the author’s ideas 
but try to pinpoint only what interests you, you lose the author’s 
ideas. You don’t comprehend anything except what happens to 
fall in your area of interest. Later in this chapter, “Scanning for the 
Information You Need” explains some scanning strategies.
Prereading to find out 
what the text is about
When you preread, you direct your attention to telltale parts of a 
text with the goal of finding out what the text is about, whether 
it’s worth reading, and what parts to read. You typically use it in 
combination with another reading method; prereading just acts as 
the first filter. For example, to preread a company report, you read 
the headings, subheadings, table titles, and chart titles. Then you 
either dismiss the whole report because it isn’t worth reading or 
you read the parts that are of interest to you.
Prereading is actually a technique for making better use of your 
reading time. Later in this chapter, “Prereading to Get the Lay of 
the Land” explains prereading in detail.
Discovering the Art of Skimming
Skimming is taking the most important information from the page 
without reading all the words. (The term comes from the act of 
skimming milk, when the dairy farmer skims the cream — the 
richest material — from the top of the milk before it’s processed.) 
Strictly speaking, skimming isn’t a reading technique but rather a 
scavenging technique. You hunt for the choicest information and 
hope important material doesn’t pass you by.

Part III: Advancing Your Speed-Reading Skills 
168
When you speed read, you skim to the extent that you don’t fixate 
on all the words. In effect, you weed out some words and focus on 
the remaining ones. However, skimming takes the notion of pass-
ing by some words to another level. In the act of skimming, you 
focus only on the essential ideas and skip over the insignificant, 
marginal, and secondary. The question is, how can you recognize 
the essential ideas in the course of your skimming and focus on 
them, not the other ideas? The following sections help you get the 
most out of skimming.
Knowing when to skim
The first step in recognizing the essential ideas when you skim is 
knowing when to skim. Some materials and situations practically 
require skimming:
 
✓ Needlessly lengthy white papers and convoluted business 
reports are almost impossible not to skim.
 
✓ Newspapers, with their ready-made word clumps, are designed 
for skimming. (See Chapter 6 for more on reading in clumps.)
 
✓ If you’re on a time crunch, you often have to skim because 
you don’t have enough time to read the material.
You may already be a skimmer
Even speed readers skim a little bit. They gloss over connecting words and other 
little words in the course of their reading. In the interest of speed, words such as 
the, and, for, and with fall under the radar.
In this paragraph, I’ve removed the connecting and little words, but you can still get 
the meaning. This paragraph demonstrates what happens when you skim rather 
than read:
 
 Horse ran meadow to woods. We chased but soon lost sight where went. I 
called several times. Came back, looking tired, the harness still her neck.
This paragraph reads like an old-fashioned telegram, but you can understand the 
meaning. In the next paragraph, I restored the connecting and little words. Speed 
read it and note what happens when you come to a word I previously removed. You 
may well skip right over it.
 
 The horse ran through the meadow and to the woods. We chased after her but 
soon lost sight of where she went. I called out her name several times. Finally 
she came loping back, looking a little tired, with the harness still around her 
neck.

 Chapter 10: Other Reading Strategies . . . 169
But sometimes you can’t find the essential ideas by skimming. If 
the reading material is especially meaty, you can’t skim. You have 
to read or speed read the material. In much of your reading, you 
may even skim part of the article and read other parts. Think of 
skimming as an extra tool that you can use in addition to speed 
reading to get your reading done on time.
 
Often a work’s opening paragraphs and the concluding paragraphs 
present the author’s main ideas. Opening paragraphs often outline 
what the author plans to prove, and closing paragraphs explain 
why the author’s proof is justified. Read these paragraphs closely; 
don’t skim them.
Bottom line: Use your judgment about when to skim. If you decide 
to skim, don’t feel like you’re losing something. You occasionally 
come across valuable material when you skim; when that happens, 
just stop skimming.
Grasping skimming techniques
Getting the essence from reading material without reading all the 
words boils down to knowing what parts to read and what parts 
to pass by. Following are some tips and techniques for recognizing 
what is important to read in the act of skimming.
Know what you want
Before you start skimming, ask yourself what you want to get from 
the book or article underneath your nose. Do you want to know 
about King Zog of Albania? Do you want to know how to sharpen 
an engraving tool? If you know exactly what you want from your 
reading, you can skim faster and better.
Think of two or three terms that describe what you want to know, 
and as you skim, keep an eye out for those two or three terms. 
Aimlessly skimming with no particular purpose can cause drowsi-
ness, and eventually, sleep.
Read vertically as well as horizontally
When skimming, you move your eyes vertically as much as you 
move your eyes horizontally. In other words, you move your 
eyes down the page as much as you move them from side to side. 
Skimming is a bit like running down stairs. Yes, you should take 
one step at a time, and running down stairs is reckless, but you 
also get there faster by running.

Part III: Advancing Your Speed-Reading Skills 
170
Think like the author
Every chapter, article, book, and Web page is written to make an 
argument or point of some kind, and if you can detect the author’s 
strategies for making his argument, you can separate the impor-
tant from the unimportant material in the course of your reading. 
You can focus on the original, meaningful material and skip over 
the material that just supports the author’s argument without 
advancing it.
Detecting the author’s strategies requires you to put yourself in 
his place. Besides noticing the material on the page, notice how 
he presents the material. See whether you can recognize how the 
author places background material, secondary arguments, tangen-
tial information, and just plain frippery — anything that isn’t essen-
tial to the thrust of his argument — that you can skip. Chapter 11 
provides detailed information about how to think like an author.
For example, an article about oil production in Saudi Arabia may 
begin with two or three background pages about the history of 
oil development on the Arabian Peninsula. If you recognize these 
paragraphs as background (and you already know the history oil 
development in Saudi Arabia), you can skip them and save yourself 
a couple of pages.
Preread before you start skimming
As “Prereading to Get the Lay of the Land” explains later in this 
chapter, you preread to examine an article before you read it. By 
prereading an article before you skim, you can pinpoint the parts 
of the article that require your undivided attention and the parts 
that you can skip.
Try to detect the main idea in the introductory paragraphs
The introductory paragraphs usually express the main idea, argu-
ment, or goal of an article or chapter. Read these paragraphs closely. 
They tell you what the author’s aim is, which can help you decide 
early on whether the article or chapter is worth reading in detail.
Sometimes the opening paragraphs, like a table of contents, lay out 
the course that the article or chapter takes. For example, scientific 
papers often begin by describing a problem of some kind, how the 
paper attempts to solve the problem, how others addressed the 
problem, and what conclusion the paper reaches. 
Read the first sentence in each paragraph
The introductory sentence of each paragraph usually describes 
what follows in the paragraph. When you skim, read the first sen-
tence in each paragraph and then decide whether the rest of the 
paragraph deserves a read. If it doesn’t, move on.

 Chapter 10: Other Reading Strategies . . . 171
Don’t necessarily read complete sentences
When skimming, you don’t even have to read complete sentences. 
If the start of a sentence holds no promise of the sentence giving 
you the information you want, skip to the next sentence. Read the 
start of sentences with an eye to whether they will yield useful 
information, and read them all the way through only if they appear 
to be useful at first glance.
Skip examples and proofs
Authors often present examples to prove a point, but if you believe 
the point doesn’t need proving, you can skip the examples. For 
instance, suppose you’re reading an article about the American 
Civil War in which the author says the war was inevitable. To 
prove the point, the article spends several pages looking into the 
slavery question, the differences between the economies of the 
North and South, and the polarizing 1860 presidential election. If 
you accept the author’s premise that the war was inevitable, you 
can skim very quickly over the examples that prove this point 
because you don’t need the proof.
Practicing skimming techniques
The two most important techniques to bear in mind when you 
skim are to move your eyes vertically as well as horizontally and 
to understand before you start skimming what information you’re 
looking for. Exercise 10-1 is designed to give you a little practice 
skimming. Follow these steps to complete the exercise:
 
1. Take a deep breath and brace yourself as though you’re 
about to run the 100-meter dash.
 
 Skimming requires as much concentration as you can 
muster. Get ready to go fast but also be thorough as you 
look for information on the page.
 
2. Imagine that you’re interested in getting the following 
information about the Internet: what was ARPANET, the 
predecessor of the Internet, and how does data travel on 
the Internet.
 
3. Start skimming “A Brief History of the Internet” by Peter 
Weverka (Practice Text 10-1), directing your eyes from 
black dot to black dot.
 
 The black dots encourage you to read vertically as well 
as horizontally. Try to resist the urge to read horizontally 
only. Take in words with your peripheral vision.

Practice Text 10-1
Most historians trace the beginning of the Internet to 
Sputnik, the first satellite to successfully orbit the earth. 
After Russia launched Sputnik in 1957, the United States 
embarked on an ambitious national project to bridge what 
was called the “technology gap” and catch up to the 
Russians in science and technology. As part of that effort, 
the Department of Defense established the Advanced 
Research Projects Agency, or ARPA, in 1958. The Agency’s 
job was to oversee the research and development of new 
technology for military use.
ARPA employed scientists and engineers in universities and 
laboratories throughout the United States. These scientists 
and engineers needed a way to exchange information and 
collaborate with one another. To this end, ARPA developed 
the first computer network, called ARPANET, in 1969. The 
network permitted researchers throughout the United 
States to dial in to and access four host computers — three 
in California and one in Utah — over the telephone lines.
To speed the transmission of data, ARPANET employed a 
novel means of sending information over the telephone 
lines called packet switching. Instead of data being sent in a 
continuous stream, it was divided into smaller units called 
packets and sent all at once over available telephone lines. 
Arriving at their destination, the packets were recompiled 
— in other words, the data was reassembled so that it could 
be read or interpreted. Like ARPANET, the Internet is a 
packet-switching network. Packet switching makes it 
possible for data to travel very quickly, because the packets 
can arrive out of order, withstand delays in transmission, 
and travel by many different routes to their destination. By 
the strictest definition, the Internet is simply a 
packet-delivery system. It can deliver information packets 
anywhere in the world in less than a second.
ARPANET was the forerunner of the Internet. In ARPANET, 
data did not pass through a central hub; instead, all the 
host computers were connected to all the other host 
computers. This revolutionary decentralized design 
permitted data to take many different routes from one 
computer to another because the computers were 
interconnected. And if one part of the network failed, the 
network’s interconnectedness made it possible for other 
parts to pick up the slack and continue transmitting data by
A Brief History of the Internet

 Chapter 10: Other Reading Strategies . . . 173
a different route. Moreover, the decentralized structure of 
ARPANET made it easier to add computers to the network.
In the beginning, only four host computers — computers 
that other computers can connect to, similar to what we call 
Web servers — were available on ARPANET, but universities 
and research centers soon understood the value of being 
able to collaborate over a network, and more host 
computers were added. By 1971, there were 23 host 
computers on ARPANET. In 1972, e-mail was invented so that 
researchers could quickly exchange messages, and network 
traffic increased dramatically. In 1977, ARPANET featured 
111 host computers. By 1989, ARPANET had become a 
“network of networks,” with some 100,000 host computers, 
and the Internet as you know it today had arrived.
Did you find out what ARPANET was? Did you discover how data 
travels over the telephone lines on the Internet? This information 
is in the essay. You really have to concentrate, and you have to 
know what you’re looking for, to skim successfully.
Scanning for the Information 
You Need
Think of scanning as a hyperactive form of skimming. You speed 
through the text in search of information without any regard for the 
overall gist of the author’s ideas. All you want is information about 
a specific topic — George Washington, the influenza virus, copper 
production in 19th-century Peru, the Battle of Hastings, or whatever. 
To help you become a top-notch scanner, the following sections give 
you tips on scanning as well as a bit of scanning practice.
Getting the hang of scanning
When you’re scanning, it helps to think in terms of targets. Think 
of an informational target you want to hit and then try to hit it in 
the text. Here are some other tips for scanning:
 
✓ Use all your powers of concentration. Scanning is boring as 
all get-out, so you may be inclined to slip into laziness. But if 
you get lazy and fail to concentrate, you won’t find the infor-
mation you want.
Practice Text 10-1 (continued)

Part III: Advancing Your Speed-Reading Skills 
174
 
✓ Scan for the two or three search terms that describe the 
information you want. You can recognize terms more readily 
on the page if you have them in mind while you scan.
 
✓ Use the Find command to scan a Web page. Press Ctrl+F (the 
Find command), enter a search term, and press Enter. Your 
Web browser scrolls to the first instance of the search term 
you entered (if the term appears on the page at all).
 
✓ Look at all italicized words. According to popular publish-
ing convention, authors often italicize and explain terms the 
first time they use them. If you’re reading a printed book or 
magazine article that conforms to these conventional editorial 
standards, you can look to italicized words for explanations 
and perhaps for the information you need.
 
✓ Don’t be shy about using the table of contents and index. 
Why scan when you can look up the information you need in 
the index? Why pore over numerous pages when the table of 
contents can direct you to the information you want?
Exercising your scanning skills
Exercise 10-2 demonstrates why scanning with a clear image of 
what you are looking for makes for more efficient scans. In the 
exercise, you look for the names of Alaskan cities in a large list:
 
1. In Practice Text 10-2 scan for the name Napakiak.
 
 Run your eyes down the list of names until you spy 
Napakiak.
 
2. Go back to the beginning of the list and scan for the 
name Bettles.
 
3. Close your eyes for a moment and picture the letters in 
the name Kasaan.
 
 This time, you’ll have a picture in your mind when you 
scan.
 
4. Start at the beginning of the list and scan for the name 
Kasaan.
 
 Did you find it more quickly when you scanned with an 
image of the word?
 
5. Close your eyes for a moment, picture the letters in the 
name Egegik, and then scan for it.
 
 I hope this exercise demonstrated that scanning with a 
clear image of what you’re looking for makes scans go 
faster.

Prereading to Get the Lay 
of the Land
Prereading is a bit like sizing up an item before you buy it. You 
wouldn’t buy the brand-new car without driving it around the 
block first, so why should you spend a bunch of time reading a 
book or article without sizing it up beforehand? Prereading can be 
a real timesaver.
Prereading involves examining the main features of a book, maga-
zine article, or Web page before you read it to find out whether it 
or parts of it are worth reading. In the following sections, I show 
you where to find these features and how to judge the value of 
reading material by prereading it.
Sizing up the reading material
No matter what type of reading material you’re faced with, you can 
tell a lot about it by prereading these important features:
 
✓ Title: You can’t judge a book by its cover, but you can often 
judge it by its title. With luck, the title is descriptive and 
includes, as so many titles do, an equally descriptive subtitle 
to help you decide whether this is the book or article you’re 
looking for.
 
✓ Author: Look at the author’s credentials to find out whether 
the author knows the topic. If you had to choose between two 
articles about molecular biology, and the author of one article 
was a biologist and the other a theologian, which article 
would you choose?
 
✓ Publication date: Take note of the publication date to see 
whether the book or article is up-to-date (if that matters in 
your reading). Look for a book’s publication date on the back 
of the title page.
 
✓ Headings and subheadings: Examine headings to find out 
what information is in the book. They also give you a sense 
of how well the author organizes information and builds 
to a conclusion. If the headings and subheadings describe 
topics that are all over the map and don’t logically follow one 
another, you may be looking at a book or article that isn’t well 
thought out — or worth reading.

 Chapter 10: Other Reading Strategies . . . 177
 
✓ Graphics, charts, and tables: Study these visuals and any 
accompanying captions; they provide a vivid picture of the 
information offered in the article or book and can give you a 
clue as to whether you’ll find the info you’re looking for.
 
✓ Paragraph length: Thumb through the book or article to 
get a sense of how many paragraphs it has and the average 
paragraph length. Each paragraph typically presents a single 
thought. Generally speaking, therefore, an article with many 
short paragraphs presents many thoughts but doesn’t elabo-
rate on them; an article with many long paragraphs doesn’t 
present as many thoughts but is more thorough in describing 
each one.
 
After you finish prereading, estimate how much time you need to 
speed read the article, chapter, or Web page. Chapter 5 explains 
how to calculate your words-per-minute reading speed. If you 
know your reading speed and roughly how many words are in the 
reading material, you can estimate your reading time by dividing 
the total number of words by your words-per-minute rate.
Getting some prereading practice
Exercise 10-3 is designed to give you a little prereading practice 
and help you understand what to examine in a chapter or article 
you preread. The exercise presents two versions of the same 
essay: one that highlights the material you preread and fills in 
the rest of the essay with nonsense, and a second that gives you 
the entire essay. You preread in the first essay and then read the 
entire second essay, answering a set of questions after each read-
ing to compare how much you pick up by prereading with how 
much you gather by reading. You may discover that sometimes 
prereading is almost as fruitful as regular reading.
Follow these steps to complete the first half of Exercise 10-3:
 
1. Preread the first version of the essay “Commit to Making 
Positive Changes” (Practice Text 10-3a).
 
 I’ve boldfaced the material you want to focus your preread-
ing on and turned the other text into Latin nonsense. Pay 
attention to the bolded information because that’s what 
the end-of-reading-quiz covers.
 
2. Take the prereadng questions quiz.
 
 Note your score so you can compare it to your second quiz 
score later in the exercise.

Commit to Making Positive Changes
by Tom Hopkins
In my seminars and my books, I have a lot to say about the 
vast importance of having goals voluptate, felis nec nulla, 
urna wisi amet dignissim suspendisse.
I’m not alone in believing that goals are vital; sodales ali-
quam arcu ut lobortis ligula, amet integer elit tempora maece-
nas ut. Nulla pharetra nibh pellentesque.
Ligula, amet review the basic rules of putting the power of 
goals to work for you.
 
• Write your goals down. Ut per, aliquam non duis 
aenean, nec nullam interdum sit curabitur duis, dui 
tempor dui id justo nibh pellentesque.
 
• Review your goals regularly. Nec nulla, urna wisi amet 
dignissim suspendisse vestibulum.
 
• Keep your goals with you. Dolor nam, velit quis quam 
in amet diam. Malesuada turpis sodales dolor voluptate, 
felis nec nulla, urna wisi amet dignissim suspendisse 
vestibulum, nam vestibulum vitae aliquam laoreet est 
mattis pellentesque.
 
• Make sure your goals are realistic. Dictum ut sodales 
litora justo penatibus, earum urna, eros ac, volutpat 
amet, felis nec nulla, urna wisi amet dignissim non duis 
aenean in magna eros sem in ipsum.
Nulla pharetra nibh the second goal I wrote down as a long-
term goal when I was 21 years old. Eu curabitur, turpis adipi-
scing nascetur vivamus.
I was sitting in an airplane. It was my first flight. Nulla 
pharetra nibh pellentesque consectetuer arcu, nulla euismod, 
euismod ridiculus malesuada dolor nam, velit quis quam in 
amet diam. Malesuada turpis sodales dolor voluptate, felis nec

I asked the man next to me, “What is that cute little plane?” 
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, integer condimentum lacus ultri-
cies egestas posuere sodales, turpis praesentium imperdiet 
nulla tellus vehicula.
Now the surprising thing about a goal that’s in writing is, if 
you concentrate on it every day, it will become real. Commodo 
phasellus ut per, aliquam non duis aenean, nec nullam interdum 
sit curabitur duis, dui tempor dui id justo. Dictum ut sodales

I’ll never forget the first time we landed to refuel. Nam ege-
stas mauris eleifend ac sed condimentum, et eleifend, ipsum 
tempus, ipsum felis pede nullam vivamus viverra integer velit.
That long-term goal turned out to be a $30,000-per-month 
goal, which turned out to be unrealistic for me. Fusce 
scelerisque malesuada sollicitudin mi, blandit ipsum nullam 
porttitor eget quod pellentesque, dignissim fringilla nunc sed 
maecenas, nec pulvinar rutrum augue proin, eu donec elit

Eu curabitur, one thing you have to realize about long-term 
goals is there will be times when you’ve got to make deci-
sions to change your goals. Volutpat et nulla est tempor, id 
donec lectus sit, leo sit cursus conubia placerat eget hyme-
naeos et nulla.
 
• Act on your goals. Felis pede nullam vivamus, non wisi 
mattis.
 
• Give yourself rewards for achieving a goal. Dignissim 
fringilla nunc sed maecenas, nec pulvinar rutrum augue 
proin, eu donec elit molestie dolor non.
 
• Plan how you’ll make your goals happen. Nam egestas 
mauris eleifend ac sed condimentum, et eleifend, ipsum

Commit to Making Positive Changes
by Tom Hopkins, author of Selling For Dummies, 2nd Edition
Originally published in 1980
In my seminars and my books, I have a lot to say about the 
vast importance of having goals that pull you forward, instead 
of relying on your ordinary needs to drive you.
I’m not alone in believing that goals are vital; practically every 
modern thinker or speaker on the subject of success extols the 
benefits of goal setting.
So let’s review the basic rules of putting the power of goals to 
work for you.
 
• Write your goals down. Unwritten goals are wishes that 
do nothing; written goals are active contracts you’ve 
made with yourself.
 
• Review your goals regularly. Otherwise they’ll fade from 
your memory and amount to zero.
 
• Keep your goals with you. If you keep the cards you’ve 
written your goals on with you, you can review and 
revise them in spare moments. The whole idea is to 
make them a living, vital part of your life and a powerful 
influence on your daily decisions.
(continued)

Part III: Advancing Your Speed-Reading Skills 
182
 
• Make sure your goals are realistic. Goals you don’t 
believe you can achieve are worse than useless because 
they blind you to goals you could achieve. And, they dis-
courage your belief in the whole goal-setting and achiev-
ing process.
Let me tell you about the second goal I wrote down as a long-
term goal when I was 21 years old. This is how vivid I want goal 
setting to become.
I was sitting in an airplane. It was my first flight. I was flying 
from California to Arizona. I’d never been in a plane before. 
You might remember your first flight. I was sitting there scared 
to death. We were taking off, and I looked out the window to 
the right and on the runway next to our plane, this beautiful 
little plane took off.
I asked the man next to me, “What is that cute little plane?” He 
said, “That’s a jet — a corporate jet.” I said, “Boy, that’s cute.” I 
took out my goal setting device right then and there and wrote 
it down — “jet, ten-year goal.”
Now the surprising thing about a goal that’s in writing is, if you 
concentrate on it every day, it will become real. I will never 
forget the day that the jet arrived. It was ten years later to the 
day. I had just finished a program in Baton Rouge, LA, and as 
I stood there on that runway and that little plane came out, I 
thought, “This is it. Ten years and I’ve arrived.”
When I got on the plane, the pilot welcomed me on. I said, 
“This is it. I’ve arrived.”
And do you know what happened? After awhile, it’s just 
another thing. A fun toy. A big toy.
I’ll never forget the first time we landed to refuel. The pilot 
came back and said, “We’ve refueled,” and handed the receipt 
to me — $882. I said, “Is this for the month?” It wasn’t.
That long-term goal turned out to be a $30,000-per-month goal, 
which turned out to be unrealistic for me. Even though I was 
earning enough to afford it, I always thought of it as an extrava-
gance. It was out of my comfort zone for me to have that plane. 
It just wasn’t a part of my reality. That’s why I only had it for 
two months.
You see, one thing you have to realize about long-term goals 
is there will be times when you’ve got to make decisions to 
change your goals. Some people are so afraid of a long-term 
goal, though, they’ll set no goals. That’s the sad part of it.
Practice Text 10-3b (continued)

 Chapter 10: Other Reading Strategies . . . 183
 
• Act on your goals. Nothing happens unless you make it 
happen.
 
• Give yourself rewards for achieving a goal. Your drive to 
achieve will wither and die if you don’t feed it some ben-
efits at least once in a while.
 
• Plan how you’ll make your goals happen. If you don’t 
plan in detail how your goals will be achieved, how can 
you make them happen?
 
• Resolve conflicts between goals immediately. People 
often set up goals that are in direct conflict with each 
other: Spend more time with the kids; spend more time 
planning and preparing for sales work. When you dis-
cover such a conflict, it alerts you to the necessity of 
making hard choices and scheduling more effectively.
 
• Make your goals relevant to your family. Unless you 
involve your family in them, your goals will conflict with 
the aims of your loved ones. This is certain to increase 
tension within your family and make the achievement 
of your purposes more difficult. Don’t leave them out; 
instead, get them on your side. “If I win this sales con-
test, we’ll all go to Disneyland.”
 
• Preserve the inspiration of your goals by keeping them 
up to date. Your life is dynamic; your desires and capa-
bilities are under constant change. New information may 
at any time make some or all of your present goals obso-
lete. When things change for you, change your goals. 
They’re not carved on Mount Rushmore.
 
• Recap your goals annually. At the end of the year, go 
over every goal you’ve set the previous year and see 
how much you’ve really accomplished. This is a great 
motivator in which to launch a whole new, even more 
productive year.
Comprehension Questions
 
1. Why does Tom Hopkins value goal-setting so highly?
 
A. Because setting goals provides special incentive to 
move you forward
 
B. Because normal motivations are insufficient

for success
 
D. Because you need a sense of humor

How did your score on the two quizzes compare? I’m betting you 
scored equally well on both quizzes. I also hope that this exercise 
demonstrated how valuable prereading is. Sometimes you can 
get away with prereading an article or chapter without reading it 
because prereading points you to the parts of reading material that 
you really need to focus on.

 Chapter 10: Other Reading Strategies . . . 185
Postreading to Reinforce 
What You Read
After you finish reading an article, chapter, or Web page, consider 
postreading it, or rereading the essential parts. In a postread, you 
know where the essential parts are and you can find and read them 
very quickly.
Postreading is an excellent way to retain what you have read. It locks 
the information you acquired into your long-term memory. Postread 
all material you’ll be tested on or material that is important to your 
job or career — in short, postread whatever you want to lock away 
in your memory. (Head to Chapter 3 for more info on short- and long-
term memory.)
 
Here’s a great way to retain what you read: Describe it to your-
self. After you finish reading an article, for example, summarize it. 
Outline the key points and describe the conclusion as though you 
wrote the article yourself. Putting an article in your own words 
makes it easier to remember. Studies show that on average you 
forget 40 to 50 percent of what you read unless you make a con-
scious effort to remember it.

Taking Advantage of Writing 
Structure to Read 
More Quickly
In This Chapter
▶ Getting the gist of a paragraph
▶ Following the author’s thought patterns
▶ Taking your cue from signal words
▶ Skipping subordinate clauses
W
hat if you could wave a magic wand over a book or article 
and instantly see only the information you need? You’d 
save hours of labor separating the information you need from the 
information you don’t need.
Scientists are still many years away from perfecting this magic 
wand. Until they perfect it, this chapter provides tips and tricks 
to help you locate the information you want and bypass needless 
information without a magic wand. This chapter further refines the 
reading strategies in Chapter 10 by showing you where to look in 
a paragraph to detect the main thrust or idea. It suggests how you 
can follow the author’s line of thought throughout an essay and in 
so doing take from the essay only the information that’s useful to 
you. It also explains how signal words can guide you to information 
and how you can save time by skirting subordinate clauses.
 
The techniques described in this chapter are especially useful 
when taking standardized tests. In these tests, when time is of 
the essence, being able to quickly pick up the author’s meaning, 
and knowing when you can skim or skip ahead, is vital. Head to 
Chapter 13 for more on speed reading standardized tests.

Part III: Advancing Your Speed-Reading Skills 
188
Getting to the Main Idea in a 
Paragraph with Topic Sentences
You may remember from your English composition class that all 
writing is constructed from paragraphs and that each paragraph 
is supposed to present one idea. A complex idea requires a long 
paragraph consisting of many sentences, whereas a simple idea 
requires only a sentence or two. Strung together, the paragraphs 
present an argument or narrative of some kind. For example, they 
describe a trip across the wilds of Borneo or the behavior of the 
stock market in the past five decades.
Going straight to the main idea of each paragraph significantly 
increases your reading speed. You don’t have to read as much to 
get a firmer grasp of the author’s fundamental ideas. (This quality 
differentiates it from skimming, a reading method in which you look 
at headings, captions, and so on to quickly find a work’s overall 
meaning. See Chapter 10 for more on skimming.)
The question is: How do you recognize the main idea in a paragraph 
amid all the details? How do you zoom to what really matters in 
each paragraph?
Understanding topic sentences
The best way to get the main idea in a paragraph is to locate 
the topic sentence. This sentence describes the subject of the 
paragraph and its main idea. If you can develop a nose for locat-
ing topic sentences, you can get the main idea from paragraphs 
quickly and thereby improve your reading speed.
Typically, the topic sentence comes first in a paragraph, and the 
remaining sentences elaborate on the topic sentence. In this para-
graph, for example, the topic sentence makes a simple assertion, 
and evidence for the truth of this assertion follows on the heels of 
the topic sentence:
Rainfall has been increasing steadily in Yoknapatawpha 
County since 1995. In that year, annual rainfall was 32 inches. 
By 2008, it was 40 inches, with an increase each year between 
1995 and 2008, except for 1999, when the annual rainfall level 
fell to 29 inches.

 Chapter 11: Taking Advantage of Writing Structure to Read More Quickly 189
But sometimes the topic sentence isn’t the first sentence in the 
paragraph. Sometimes it’s buried deeper. In this paragraph, the 
second sentence is the topic sentence:
Looking at rainfall in Yoknapatawpha County since 1995, a 
clear trend is evident. Except for 1999, when the annual rain-
fall level fell to 29 inches, rainfall has increased steadily since 
1995. Between that year and 2008, rainfall rose from 32 to 40 
inches annually.
The author of the following paragraph is a bit of a windbag and 
takes his time getting to the main idea. In this paragraph, the topic 
sentence is the last sentence:
Is it getting wetter or drier in Yoknapatawpha County? A quick 
look at the record gives a clear answer. Between 1995 and 2008, 
rainfall rose from 32 to 40 inches annually (although in 1999 it 
dipped to 29 inches). From this information, it’s plain to see 
that rainfall in the county has increased steadily since 1995.
Locating the topic sentence
Because the topic sentence can be located anywhere, how can you 
spot the topic sentence and get to the main idea in a paragraph? 
Here’s how:
 
✓ Read the first sentence carefully. Three times out of five, the 
topic sentence is the first sentence.
 
✓ Consider what basic property or characteristic of the para-
graph describes. This attribute is the paragraph’s main idea, 
so the sentence that expresses it is your topic sentence.
 
✓ Think about the paragraph’s purpose. The paragraph most 
likely wants to impart a particular piece of information. If you 
can figure out what that piece is, you know the paragraph’s 
topic and can find the sentence that presents it.
 
Observe the author’s writing style to determine where she likes 
to put the topic sentence in paragraphs. After you’ve spent some 
time with an author, you can begin to see where he or she likes to 
put topic sentences. In formal writing, the topic sentence almost 
always comes first in paragraphs. Chatty writers tend to put the 
topic sentence in the middle or end of paragraphs. Knowing your 
author’s style helps you locate the topic sentence faster.

Thinking Like the Author
Different authors use different strategies in their work, and if you 
can identify and detect these strategies, you can find and absorb 
the author’s ideas more efficiently. This section explains how to do 
just that by taking knowledge levels into account and paying atten-
tion to structure.
 
A good way to detect the author’s strategy for presenting ideas is to 
turn quickly through the text, paying special attention to headings.
Taking knowledge level into account
Every book and article assumes that the reader has a certain 
amount of knowledge of the topic at hand. For example, I wrote the 
For Dummies book you’re currently reading on the assumption that 
you’re a beginning speed reader. If I were writing this book for an 
audience of reading educators, I would assume they already have a 
background in speed-reading techniques, and I wouldn’t spend as 
much time describing speed-reading fundamentals.
Consider yourself lucky if every article and book you read is writ-
ten to your knowledge level. Usually you have to read above your 
knowledge level or below it because the material is more complex 
than you want or too simple for your needs.
After you’ve had a taste of the article or book you’re reading, con-
sider what knowledge level it’s written to and change your reading 
accordingly:
 
✓ If the reading material is too complex for your taste, read a 
little more slowly. You’re likely to encounter terminology and 
background information that you don’t know.
 
✓ If the reading material is simpler than what you need, read 
quickly and skim where you can. Read more aggressively than 
usual and cherry-pick information from the text.
Paying attention to structure
Essays and articles, like buildings, must have a structure or frame-
work if they’re going to hold up, and you can make your reading 
more efficient if you pay attention to structure. After you know 
how a piece is structured, you can focus on the parts that inter-
est you and skim or skip the rest. The following sections describe 
some common writing structures.

 Chapter 11: Taking Advantage of Writing Structure to Read More Quickly 191
The basic essay
In its most basic form, an essay has the following structure (you 
may remember this from school):
 
1. Introduction describing what’s in the essay and what the 
essay aims to prove or demonstrate
 
2. Argument presenting facts in order of significance support-
ing the essay’s argument
 
3. Conclusion summarizing the facts with a statement declar-
ing how the facts support the argument
To quickly read this kind of essay, you can read the introduction 
to see whether the essay is worth reading, read the facts that are 
unknown to you (skipping the known facts), and read the conclu-
sion only if you need more convincing or you’re unsure how the 
argument leads to the conclusion. In a basic essay, the conclusion 
is foreshadowed by the introduction, so reading the conclusion is 
optional.
The news story
News stories like the kind found in newspapers also have a simple 
structure because they’re written to be read quickly. In the open-
ing paragraph, the author tells you the when, where, what, why, 
who, and how. After that, the story presents ever-widening levels 
of detail with the idea that you can quit reading whenever you 
want. News stories don’t end with summary conclusions. The 
structure of a news story looks something like this:
 
1. Introduction explaining when, where, what, and how
 
2. Body presenting increasingly more refined details and 
background information
Compare and contrast
The compare-and-contrast structure presents items, ideas, and so on 
to describe a topic and highlight its special qualities. For example, 
an author may compare the public transportation systems of Paris 
and Tokyo to highlight challenges facing civil engineers.
In this structure, the author introduces several subtopics one at a 
time and then draws comparisons and makes contrasts. While you 
read, take note when a new subtopic begins and skip or skim it if 
you’re already familiar with it. Slow down for subtopics with infor-
mation that’s new to you.

Part III: Advancing Your Speed-Reading Skills 
192
Division and subdivision
The division-and-subdivision structure divides a topic into subtopics 
and further subtopics to make it easier to understand. This kind 
of piece can be the easiest or most difficult to read, depending on 
whether the author wrote descriptive headings and subheadings:
 
✓ If the author writes a good heading, you can preread the head-
ings and subheadings to locate the information you need. 
(Chapter 10 explains prereading.)
 
✓ If the headings aren’t descriptive, skim the essay to get a 
sense of how it’s divided into topics and subtopics and try 
to locate the information that’s meaningful to you.
Cause and effect
Authors use the cause-and-effect structure to explain why an 
event or condition (such as lung cancer) occurs and what its 
consequences are.
The cause-and-effect structure looks something like this:
 
1. Causes of the event
 
2. The event
 
3. Consequences of the event
As a reader of a cause-and-effect essay, you can save time by dis-
tinguishing between the direct and indirect causes (if the author 
doesn’t do a good job of it), and focus on the direct causes. You 
can also save time by focusing on the area (causes, event, or con-
sequences) with the information you need.
Chronological
In the chronological structure, the author describes events accord-
ing to a timeline, with the earliest event first and the others follow-
ing after. History articles are almost always written this way.
 
As you read a chronological essay, always remember what year or 
time period you’re reading about and note how one subject links to 
the next. Doing so helps you retain what you read.
Looking Out for Signal Words
Signal words tell you where the author is going next, and if you’re 
alert to these words, you can improve your reading efficiency. You 

 Chapter 11: Taking Advantage of Writing Structure to Read More Quickly 193
can tell what direction the author is going in and judge right away 
whether to keep reading, skim, or skip ahead. Signal words cue 
you to the author’s line of thought. They tell you when the author 
is about to present a contrast, comparison, conclusion, additional 
argument, or example. Keeping an eye out for signal words can 
make you a more efficient reader because signal words help you 
decide whether to keep reading, skim, or skip ahead.
Contrast signals
Contrast signals introduce a thought or description that contrasts 
with a previously described thought or description. Contrast sig-
nals include
although, but, conversely, despite, however, instead, in oppo-
sition, on the contrary, on the other hand, nevertheless, none-
theless, rather than, still, then again, while
Here are examples of how contrast signals are used:
The team lost many of its important players to injury. 
Nevertheless, the team remained a formidable opponent.
Although Munich was the most populous city in West 
Germany, Bonn, a small university town, was the capital.
Rather than study fungi as they did until quite recently, mycol-
ogists now study yeasts.
When you encounter a contrast signal and believe that the author 
is about to draw a contrast, decide whether reading the contrast-
ing thought will clarify the author’s argument. If you don’t need a 
clarification, skim or skip ahead.
Comparison signals
Comparison signals tell you when the author is going to compare what 
was already described to something new. Comparisons underscore 
the similarities and differences between objects, concepts, and so on 
to bring these characteristics to light. Comparison signals include
and, by comparison, by the same token, correspondingly, 
equally, in the same way, likewise, similarly

Part III: Advancing Your Speed-Reading Skills 
194
These examples demonstrate how comparison signals are used:
By comparison to the Greeks, the Romans were also excellent 
scientists, especially in the field of engineering.
Similarly, Placido Domingo had a strong tenor voice and a keen 
acting ability.
Likewise, the next governor faced many economic problems, 
and he had few resources for tackling them.
If you understand the quality being described that the author 
wants to illuminate with a comparison, don’t bother reading the 
comparison. Skim or skip ahead.
Example signals
Example signals are pretty self-explanatory: They introduce an 
example. After all, using an example is the easiest and best way to 
strengthen an argument. Here are some common example signals:
as an example, for example, for instance
Here are some sample example signals (say that five times fast):
Construction costs have risen precipitously. As an example, 
the cost of sheetrock has risen from 1 to 2 dollars per square 
foot.
Forest eco-systems are susceptible to a variety of distur-
bances. For example, fires typically occur at a 30- to 50-year 
interval.
All is not well in Denmark. For instance, consider last year’s 
presidential election.
If you’re in agreement with the author and don’t require an exam-
ple to understand his point, skim or skip over the example.
Additional argument signals
Additional argument signals cue you when the author is about to 
give more reasons to support her argument. These signals include
also, and, as well, besides, furthermore, in addition, moreover, 
what’s more

 Chapter 11: Taking Advantage of Writing Structure to Read More Quickly 195
Check out these examples of additional argument signals:
The ancients considered it a remedy for the common cold. 
They also took it for breathing ailments and allergies.
Besides, the knights carried another weapon to strike terror in 
their opponents — the longbow.
You can visit the outstanding art museums and galleries. 
Moreover, you can spend the day at one of the city’s many 
beaches.
If you’re already convinced by the author’s argument, you can 
skim or skip ahead when you come to an additional argument 
signal. Keep reading if you remain unconvinced and you still want 
to be persuaded.
Causation signals
Causation signals tell you that the author is about to describe 
the result of a previously described activity or phenomenon. 
Causation signals include
as, because, consequently, given that, for this reason, owing 
to, seeing that, since, therefore, thus
Here are some causation signals in action:
It was much too cold even for ice fishing. Therefore, they 
stayed home and watched hockey on TV.
Owing to a lack of foresight and planning, they had to declare 
bankruptcy.
Because of this simple oversight, the wall crumbed and the 
plain was flooded.
When you encounter a causation signal, decide whether you 
already know the result (or it’s worth knowing). Then skim or skip 
ahead if you don’t need or care to know the result.
Conclusion signals
Conclusion signals indicate when the author is about to draw a 
conclusion. Typically, conclusion signals appear at the bottom of a 
paragraph or article. Conclusion signals include
accordingly, as a result, consequently, finally, in brief, in con-
clusion, in short, in sum

Part III: Advancing Your Speed-Reading Skills 
196
These examples show how authors use conclusion signals:
Finally, when the verdict was delivered, it became a matter not 
for us but for the law books.
In conclusion, there are only three types of soil according to 
this parable — where the ground is hard, where it is rocky, and 
where it is capable of sprouting seeds.
The audience accordingly left the theater in a state of bewilder-
ment, wondering what they had just witnessed.
When you see a conclusion signal, keep reading if a wrap-up of 
what you just read is useful to you; if the conclusion is foregone in 
your opinion, skim or skip ahead.
Recognizing and Skipping 
Subordinate Clauses
Subordinate clauses get that name for a reason: They convey 
information that is secondary to the essential idea or thrust of the 
sentence. Subordinate clauses are sometimes called dependent 
clauses because they depend on other parts of the sentence to 
give them meaning.
In the following example sentence, the subordinate clause tells you 
how long the country waited, but this information is secondary 
to the real news — that the king was safe (I put the subordinate 
clause in italics so that you can find it more easily):
The entire country, which had been waiting for weeks for news 
about the king, learned that he was safe in the castle.
Because subordinate clauses convey secondary information, con-
sider skimming or skipping them when you’re in a hurry. The easi-
est way to recognize a subordinate clause is to look for the relative 
pronouns that typically introduce subordinate clauses:
which, whichever, who, whoever, whom, whose, whomever, 
whosoever
Exercise 11-1 gives you practice in recognizing subordinate clauses 
and demonstrates why skipping these clauses can save you time. 
In the exercise, you read two sets of sentences. In the first set, 
you read the entire sentence, and in the second, you skip over the 
subordinate clauses. Afterward, you note how long it took to read 
each set of sentences.

 Chapter 11: Taking Advantage of Writing Structure to Read More Quickly 197
Follow these steps to complete the first half of Exercise 11-1:
 
1. Using a timer, read Sentences 1 through 10 of Practice 
Text 11-1 in their entirety and note where the subordi-
nate clauses occur.
 
 Each sentence contains one subordinate clause.
 
2. In Appendix B, mark down how long you take to read 
Sentences 1 through 10.
Practice Text 11-1
 
1. The Sierra Madre, which is the tallest of the mountain 
ranges, loomed in the distance.
 
2. We worried because Mr. Haines, who owned the dog, had 
recently left the city.
 
3. The people whose cheers egged him on were suddenly 
ashamed.
 
4. The woman, who wore a gray blouse and skirt, left her keys 
there.
 
5. Whichever makes the grade, St. Louis or Detroit, will win 
the prize.
 
6. The carpenter, who does very fine work, is available now.
 
7. Whoever they turn out to be, the outlaw gang will be pun-
ished accordingly.
 
8. Poor old Bill, whose car it was, thanked the firefighters.
 
9. Ms. Watson, who supervised the construction of the build-
ing, said it was complete.
 
10. The apple pie, which turned out to be delicious, was sitting 
on the window sill.
Follow these steps to complete the second half of Exercise 11-1:
 
1. Again using a timer, read sentences 11 through 20, skip-
ping the subordinate clauses.
 
 When you see the relative pronouns which, who, or whose, 
skip ahead.
 
2. Note how long you take to read Sentences 11 through 20 
in Appendix B.

Part III: Advancing Your Speed-Reading Skills 
198
Practice Text 11-1 (continued)
 
11. A single church spire, which came to a narrow point, stood 
out against the sky.
 
12. We shouted at the cat, which kept scratching us, to cut 
it out.
 
13. The baseball players whose bats they were told us to stay 
and watch the game.
 
14. The man, who wore a stripped shirt and short pants, ran 
away.
 
15. Whichever comes first. the Chevy or the Ford, will receive 
our praise
 
16. The student, who is first in her class, is waiting for us.
 
17. Whoever they are, the whole kit and caboodle are in for a 
surprise.
 
18. Ms. Wilcox, whose house we visited, knew him too.
 
19. The dean, who was forced to apologize, looked upset.
 
20. The trophy case, which turned out to be made of glass, 
shined in the brilliant light.
I’m betting you took less time to read the second set of sentences. I’m 
also guessing that you lost very little in terms of comprehension when 
you skipped over the subordinate clauses. When you’re in a hurry, 
glide over subordinate clauses without reading them or paying them 
much attention.

Improving Your 
Comprehension

In this part...
W
hat’s the use of reading if you don’t understand 
the author’s words? Part IV looks into the all-
important matter of how to improve your comprehension 
when you read.
Take a look at Chapter 12 for guidance on improving your 
vocabulary. Chapter 13 is a catchall chapter with informa-
tion on speed reading while taking standardized tests and 
reading textbooks and newspapers, among other things. 
Regardless of your situation, you’re sure to fi nd something 
useful in Chapter 13.

Chapter 12
Expanding Your Vocabulary 
to Become a Better 
Speed Reader
In This Chapter
▶ Exploring how you acquire new vocabulary words
▶ Tackling prefixes, roots, and suffixes
T
he larger your vocabulary is, the faster you can read because 
you don’t stumble as often on words you don’t know or recog-
nize. When you read words that you’re already familiar with, you 
read beyond the words for their meanings. In the act of reading, 
you absorb ideas, thoughts, feelings, and descriptions, not indi-
vidual words. You see the forest, not the trees.
This chapter offers advice for expanding your vocabulary so you 
can become a better speed reader. It explains how you acquire new 
vocabulary words and how you recognize and interpret prefixes, 
root words, and suffixes in words.
 
By the way, be sure to check out Appendix A if you are interested 
in expanding your vocabulary. Appendix A lists prime words, the 
2,000 most common words in the English language. Prime words 
comprise about 75 percent of words you encounter in your read-
ing, so mastering them goes a long way toward knowing the words 
you need in your reading.
Understanding How Your 
Vocabulary Expands
Educators debate about how to enlarge children’s vocabularies. 
One side says to have them memorize words, and the other is in 

Part IV: Improving Your Comprehension 
202
favor of giving them more reading experience and trusting them to 
grasp new vocabulary words in reading material that is meaningful 
to them. I side with the second group.
When most people hear the word vocabulary, they have dreary 
memories of the former kind of vocabulary instruction. Typically, 
the teacher would give out a list of vocabulary words, and you’d 
look up the words in a dictionary and write down their definitions. 
A day or so later, you took a quiz on the words, and you had to 
regurgitate their definitions on a piece of ruled paper (which made 
you kind of nauseated for real). You wondered whether you’d ever 
have the occasion to use the vocabulary words in real life.
Unfortunately for schoolchildren the world over, memorizing 
vocabulary words is one of the least efficient ways to expand your 
vocabulary. Studies show that you learn new words best when the 
words have meaning for you or you discover them in context.
Discovering vocabulary 
words by meaning
No matter how arcane or hard to pronounce it is, you can pick 
up and retain a new word if it has meaning for you. Studies show 
that the best way to acquire more vocabulary words is by real-
world experience, not artificial memorization. When you need a 
new word, you learn it. This ability explains why most people’s 
vocabulary ceases growing after adolescence — they have fewer 
experiences that require them to learn new words. By age 5, most 
children have a vocabulary of about 4,000 words; by age 7, they 
know 20,000 words; and by age 10 they know 35,000. After that, the 
world isn’t as new as it was before — kids have less to discover — 
and the average person’s vocabulary grows at a much slower rate.
For example, consider the case of the woman who set out to become 
a gourmet cook. In the beginning, the names of cooking utensils like 
zester, wok, lamé, and passatutto were incomprehensible to her. After 
she got her hands on these utensils and used them in her kitchen, 
however, she could pass you the zester without blinking an eye. 
Absorbing these new words wasn’t hard for her because she literally 
had hands-on experience with these cooking utensils, and knowing 
their names was necessary to her goal of becoming a gourmet cook.
Or consider what happens when you become ill. Because your health 
is at stake, you soon become intimately acquainted with hard-to-
understand words from the medical profession that previously meant 
nothing to you. You want to master the words so you can intelligently 
discuss your health with your doctor, and you’re soon able to throw 
these words around almost as well as your doctor can.

 Chapter 12: Expanding Your Vocabulary . . . 203
Discovering vocabulary 
words by context
You can also acquire new vocabulary words by context in the 
course of you reading. Whether you know it or not, you have a 
built-in aptitude for learning words by context. You don’t have to 
consult a dictionary in your reading when you want to understand 
a new word. You learned new words by context when you first 
began to speak, and you certainly don’t need to stop now. After 
all, no 3-year-old ever consults a dictionary, and yet a 3-year-old’s 
vocabulary grows at a very fast clip.
When you come across a word you don’t know, study it for a minute. 
See whether any part of it looks familiar. Perhaps you recognize a 
prefix, root, or suffix in the word that gives you a clue to its mean-
ing (later in this chapter, “Looking at Prefixes, Roots, and Suffixes” 
explains what those elements are). Perhaps the sentence and para-
graph where the word is found tell you what the word means.
Consider these sentences. Can you tell by context what the words 
in italics mean?
The Bishop carried a large crosier. It was shaped like a shep-
herd’s crook, only it was ornate and encrusted with jewels.
The English dramatist W.S. Gilbert, who once remarked “I hate 
my fellow man,” was a famous misanthrope.
She loved to study, so much so that her friends started calling 
her a bluestocking.
The amount of storage space on computers keeps getting 
larger. My first computer had only 15 kilobytes of storage. My 
next one had 20 gigabytes. Pretty soon we will measure stor-
age in terabytes and petabytes.
 
The main point to remember about enlarging your vocabulary 
while you read is to not gloss over words you don’t know. Pause in 
your reading and give them a moment’s thought. You can’t learn 
new words if you don’t take the time to decode and absorb them.
 
To expand your vocabulary when reading, stretch your reading 
boundaries a little. As well as reading the metro section of the 
newspaper, for example, read the business section, where you 
can find business terminology and investment jargon you’ve never 
heard before. Read books outside your field of interest and scope 
of understanding. Next time you find yourself staring at the myriad 
of magazines on a magazine rack, choose a magazine you’ve never 
read before. Stray to obscure aisles of the library or bookstore and 
see what you discover.

Part IV: Improving Your Comprehension 
204
Looking at Prefixes, 
Roots, and Suffixes
One way to get a head start on expanding your vocabulary is to 
be able to recognize and interpret prefixes, roots, and suffixes in 
words. Many English words are constructed from the same pre-
fixes, roots, and suffixes. Master these affixes (as linguists call 
them) and you can interpret many words you don’t understand 
without having to resort to a dictionary.
For example, consider the word neologism. If you know this word’s 
prefix, root, and suffix, you can understand its meaning without a 
dictionary:
 
✓ neo: This prefix means “new”; you can also find it in the 
words Neolithic and neophyte.
 
✓ log: This root means “word”; it also appears in the words dia-
logue, epilogue, and monologue.
 
✓ ism: This suffix indicates a condition or manner. It also shows 
up in the words baptism and criticism.
You can tell from decoding this word’s prefix, root, and suffix that 
a neologism is (drum roll, please) a new word or phrase.
Putting in a kind word for the dictionary
Don’t hesitate to keep a dictionary nearby and consult it when you stumble upon a 
word you don’t know. Circle each word you look up, and the pages of your diction-
ary soon fill with circled words. When you come across a circled word in the act 
of looking up a word definition, quiz yourself to see whether you understand the 
circled word’s meaning.
You can also consult online dictionaries. Looking up a word online is often easier 
than looking it up in the pages of a fat, unwieldy book. Here are a few options:
 ✓ American Heritage Dictionary: www.bartleby.com/61/
 ✓ Dictionary.com: dictionary.reference.com/
 ✓ Merriam-Webster: www.merriam-webster.com/
 ✓ Yourdictionary.com: www.yourdictionary.com/
The Open Directory Project maintains a Web page with links to many different 
kinds of dictionaries, including foreign-language and specialty dictionaries. Head to 
www.dmoz.org//Reference/Dictionaries to check out this resource.

 Chapter 12: Expanding Your Vocabulary . . . 205
The following sections look at common prefixes, roots, and suffixes 
with the aim of helping you decode words as you read them and 
add words to your vocabulary. Get acquainted with these affixes; 
knowing their meanings can help you decipher most Greek- and 
Latin-derived words in a snap.
Peeking at prefixes
A prefix appears at the beginning of a word to give the word a new 
inflection or meaning. Table 12-1 lists common prefixes and their 
meanings and lists example words to help you understand what

Chapter 13
Applying Speed Reading to 
Various Reading Tasks
In This Chapter
▶ Speeding through the news
▶ Staying focused on online articles
▶ Eliminating the e-mail slog
▶ Speed reading nonfiction and textbooks
▶ Sticking it to standardized tests
T
his chapter explores reading challenges and strategies that 
come with common reading tasks such as keeping up with 
the news and dealing with a flood of e-mail. It also gives advice for 
readers faced with daunting nonfiction books or textbooks. You 
also discover tips for nailing standardized tests.
 
Though I don’t specifically mention all kinds of literature and com-
munication here, you can use the strategies in this chapter (and 
throughout this book) to speed read magazines, memos, sales 
reports, trade journals, medical articles — the list is endless.
Speed Reading the Newspaper
Newspapers are built for speed reading. The newspaper is divided 
into sections — news, sports, business, and so on — to help you 
quickly locate articles that interest you. On the front page, the 
article that the editors deem most important occupies the upper-
right columns; the second most important article appears in the 
upper-left columns. Some articles have subheadings that spell out 
what information is available. In news articles, facts are presented 
in descending order of importance so that you can get the gist of 
a story by reading the first one or two paragraphs and then keep 
reading if you decide you want to know more. The narrow columns 

Part IV: Improving Your Comprehension 
222
help with reading speed because they encourage you to take in the 
five to seven words that span each column with a single eye fixa-
tion, and that increases your reading speed.
That doesn’t mean you can go full blast whenever you read the 
newspaper. You have to slow down from time to time, depending 
on the type of article you’re reading:
 
✓ Fact reporting: You can read articles that report bare facts — 
like the kind that are found on the first page — quickly. These 
articles explain the how, where, who, when, and why. You can 
speed read this information.
 
✓ Explanation: Slow down when you encounter an article that 
attempts to explain the news. These articles offer opinion as 
well as fact, so you have to take extra time to distinguish the 
author’s opinions from fact and read the opinions with a criti-
cal eye.
 
✓ Opinion: Read opinion pieces like the kind found on the op-ed 
page slowly. These articles aren’t structured like the other 
articles in the newspaper. In an opinion piece, the author 
constructs an argument, and you have to mind how the argu-
ment unfolds to see whether you agree with it. Because opin-
ion pieces are subjective, you have to read them skeptically 
(and perhaps seek out opposing views as well). This practice 
requires more reading time.
Finding news to speed read online
Here are some good online places to look for news about your favorite topic:
 ✓ All the Web News (www.alltheweb.com/?cat=news): Search for news 
by keyword or click the Advanced Search link to search for news by category.
 ✓ Alta Vista News (news.altavista.com): Search for news by keyword. 
You can make choices on the Topic, Region, and Date Range drop-down menus 
to direct your search.
 ✓ Google News (news.google.com): Search for news by keyword in 4,500 
news sources or by browsing in different categories.
 ✓ World News Network (www.wn.com): Search in news sources outside the 
United States.
 ✓ Yahoo! News (news.yahoo.com): Search for news by keyword or by 
browsing in different categories for stories collected by Yahoo! editors.
By the way, you can locate any newspaper’s home page from the Metagrid Web 
site. Its address is www.metagrid.com

 Chapter 13: Applying Speed Reading to Various Reading Tasks 223
 
Be extra alert when the author of a newspaper article ventures his 
or her opinion in a fact-reporting or explanation article. In these 
articles, determining whether you’re reading a fact or an opinion is 
difficult. By necessity, you have to read more slowly in these cases 
to separate facts from opinions.
Managing Online Articles
Many people do the majority of their reading on the Internet. 
Where speed reading is concerned, the same basic rules apply to 
reading online and reading words printed on good old-fashioned 
paper. Reading online, however, has a couple of advantages and 
disadvantages.
The advantages of reading online have to do with being able to manip-
ulate the appearance of text. You can use commands in your Web 
browser to enlarge or shrink the text and make reading more comfort-
able for you. (In Internet Explorer, choose View➪Text Size and select 
an option on the submenu; in Mozilla Firefox, choose View➪Zoom 
In or Zoom Out.) You can also enlarge the Web page you are reading 
to full-screen size (press F11). At full-screen size, the Web browser 
menus and toolbars are hidden, which makes it easier to focus on the 
text. (Press F11 again to display menus and toolbars).
The disadvantages of reading online all boil down to one central 
problem — it’s harder to focus and concentrate when reading 
online, and focusing and concentrating with more force of will is a 
basic principle of speed reading.
Tips for reading computer screen text
Reading lots of text on a computer screen can be uncomfortable, but these helpful 
hints make computer reading less of a strain on your eyes. Make sure your monitor 
is in the proper light. If you’re using a flat-screen LCD monitor, put it in direct light. 
LCD monitors are sidelit or backlit, and they’re easier to see in full lighting. If you’re 
using an old-fashioned CRT monitor (one of those bulky jobs that weighs a ton), 
keep the monitor out of direct light to prevent glare.
Try experimenting with the knobs and controls on your monitor. Twist and turn 
them until you find a look for the screen that is comfortable for your eyes. And you 
can adjust your Web browser to shrink and enlarge the text on-screen. Check out 
“Managing Online Articles” in this chapter for directions.

Part IV: Improving Your Comprehension 
224
Think of all the distractions and temptations you’re subject to 
when you’re online. If you start to get bored, you can always go to 
a different page or site, and you can get there faster than you can 
snap your fingers. Hyperlinks in the text all cry out for you to click 
them and go elsewhere. Some Web pages play music or sound, 
which can be a distraction. Have you checked your e-mail lately? 
Maybe somebody you want to hear from has written you.
You have to redouble your efforts at concentration when you 
speed read online. Bear down and really focus on what you’re read-
ing. Pretend that you’re reading from a printed page. That way, you 
aren’t as tempted by the many distractions of the Internet.
Handling E-mail Correspondence
If you’re one of those unfortunate souls who receives 30, 40, 50, or 
more e-mail messages daily, you owe it to yourself and your sanity 
to figure out a scheme for speed reading, prioritizing, and storing 
all that e-mail.
You can read most e-mail messages quickly because e-mail mes-
sages are by nature short and to the point. As for long e-mails, use 
the same speed-reading techniques you use, for example, to read an 
essay, and don’t be afraid to scan and skim (check out Chapter 10).
Just remember that all e-mail programs offer you the opportunity 
to choose a font and font size that make reading e-mail easier. If 
you read your e-mail in a Web-based program such as Google Mail, 
you can change the size of e-mail text by changing the text size set-
ting in your Web browser (see the preceding section for resizing 
details). If you read your e-mail in a program such as Outlook 2007, 
look for the menu commands that control the font and font size of 
text and experiment with them until you find a font and font size 
that makes reading the messages easier.
A place for everything
You can’t speed read an old e-mail if you can’t find it. To prioritize and sort e-mail, 
set up a folder scheme for storing the mail and place e-mail messages in the cor-
rect folders after you read them. For example, create and name an e-mail folder for 
each project you’re working on and then shunt e-mail messages into the project 
folders as you finish reading them. This strategy makes it easier for you to locate 
and reply to e-mail messages.

 Chapter 13: Applying Speed Reading to Various Reading Tasks 225
You can save time by weeding out mail that doesn’t need reading 
in the first place. When you check your e-mail, start by deleting all 
messages that don’t matter to you. If your e-mail program has a 
spam filter, use it. Spam filters prevent junk e-mail from arriving in 
your inbox to torture you. 
Prereading Nonfiction Books
It’s true — you can’t judge a book by its cover. But you can tell a lot 
about a nonfiction book by prereading it, or examining the particulars 
before you read the first page. (Check out Chapter 10 for more on the 
art of prereading.). By prereading, you can tell what information is in 
the book and whether reading part or all of it is worthwhile.
Examine these parts of a book before you read it:
 
✓ Table of contents: Glance at the chapter titles and headings 
to find out what’s in the book. You can also tell a lot about an 
author’s ability to organize ideas and present arguments from 
the table of contents. If the topics in the table of contents are 
presented in a logical manner, if each topic leads succinctly into 
the next, you’re holding a well-organized book in your hands.
 
✓ Index: Scour the index for information about the topic you’re 
interested in. If the information you need isn’t in the index, 
the book probably isn’t worth reading.
 
✓ Preface: You can usually find a good description of the book’s 
purpose in the preface, as well as information about the 
author’s background and credentials.
 
✓ Introduction: A good introduction explains what is covered in 
the book. Plus, you can get a feel for the author’s writing and 
determine whether the book will be easy to read or a slog.
 
✓ Chapter summaries: Find out whether the last paragraph of 
each chapter offers a summary of the chapter; if it does, read 
those last paragraphs first. You can get a rock-solid idea of 
what the book covers this way.
 
While you’re examining your nonfiction book, take a look at the 
copyright page to see when it was published. If the book covers a 
subject that has undergone changes in recent years, the book may 
be out of date and not useful to you. The copyright page is located 
on the flipside of the title page.

Part IV: Improving Your Comprehension 
226
Tackling Textbooks
I’m guessing that if you have to read a textbook, you have no 
choice in the matter because a teacher or professor assigned it 
to you. I bet your textbook is many pages long and would crush 
your big toe if you happened to drop it there. And I imagine your 
instructor assigns many pages as though you have nothing else to 
do with your time, and you want some advice about speed reading 
them so that you can go out (or, you know, get some sleep) later.
Earlier in this chapter, “Prereading nonfiction books” explains how 
to examine a book to find out what information it offers before 
you begin reading. The prereading advice for examining nonfiction 
books also applies to textbooks. Here are some specific tips for 
reading textbooks quickly:
 
✓ Read the glossary first (if your textbook has one). Taking the 
time to acquire words you don’t know from the glossary is 
worthwhile because it enables you to read the textbook that 
much more quickly when the time comes to start reading.
 
✓ Scour the pages for graphs, charts, and tables. Especially 
in science textbooks, graphs, charts, and tables sometimes 
tell half the story. Acquainting yourself with these items is an 
excellent way to get a feel for the information that the text-
book has to offer.
 
✓ Find out what your teacher or professor wants you to learn 
from the textbook and seek out that info. No sense in slaving 
over text you’re not accountable for. Plus, you probably paid 
a small fortune for that textbook; your teacher or professor 
owes you an explanation about what to read in it.
 
✓ Develop an underlining or note-taking scheme and mark the 
textbook as you read. My favorite note-taking technique is to 
draw a dot next to passages in the book that I think are impor-
tant or worth reviewing. Later, I can quickly scan for these 
important passages. (See Chapter 10 for more on scanning.)
 
✓ Improve retention by reviewing and quizzing yourself. 
When you finish reading a chapter or selection, pause a 
moment and summarize to yourself what you just read. 
Make up half a dozen questions about the material and then 
answer them. This technique helps you retain what you read. 
Retention matters more than usual when reading textbooks 
because you’re usually quizzed or tested about textbook 
material. And though this practice takes a bit more time ini-
tially, it actually saves you time in the long run because you 
don’t spend as much time rereading later.

 Chapter 13: Applying Speed Reading to Various Reading Tasks 227
Speed Reading Standardized Tests
Here’s a little-known fact that can help you immensely when you 
take a standardized test such as the SAT, LSAT, or a driver’s license 
exam: Every standardized test is really a speed-reading test.
Standardized tests don’t measure what you know as much as 
they measure how well you can apply logic and reason to differ-
ent topics. If you can read the questions and test material more 
quickly, you get more time to think through to the right answers. 
A standardized test measures how much time you give yourself to 
think, and if you can speed read, you get more time for thinking.
To test my theory, try this experiment: Next time you watch a TV 
quiz show such as Jeopardy! that requires you to read questions, try 
applying speed-reading techniques to your reading. You’ll read the 
questions faster, get more time to find the answers, and discover 
Helping your child become a speedy reader
To become a speed reader, one of your first challenges is to stop vocalizing when 
you read. If you say the words when you read, you can’t read quickly because 
saying words to yourself takes time — time you can use to speed ahead with your 
reading.
Most people vocalize because that’s how they learned to read. In the learn-to-read 
phase, first, second, and third graders learn to sound out words by recognizing 
letter combinations on the page and speaking these combinations as sounds in 
the act of reading.
If you want your child to become a speed reader (or at least a better reader), your 
first task is to discourage the vocalization habit. Starting in the third or fourth grade, 
have your child concentrate on reading without vocalizing. Tell him to see and read 
more than one word at a time and process the words without sounding them out.
If your child continues to move his lips in the act of reading, have him chew gum, 
hold a finger over his closed lips, or hold a pencil in his lips while reading. Present 
this correction as a fun activity for your child to engage in, and he’ll quickly break 
the vocalization habit.
Studies show that children from households where parents and other family mem-
bers read are better readers than other children. These children understand that 
reading is a pleasurable activity, not an onerous chore. Make books and reading a 
part of your family’s daily life if you want your child to read well. If you have young 
children who aren’t of reading age, read to them on a regular basis. It will give them 
a big head start when it comes time for them to read on their own.

that you answer the questions correctly more often. You can apply 
the extra time you gain by speed reading to rummaging in your 
brain for the right answer.
Here are some tips for taking standardized tests:
 
✓ Preread the test before you answer any questions. No cheating; 
wait until your allotted time begins, of course. Find out which 
parts of the test are easiest for you and answer the questions in 
those parts of the test first. If time is a factor in taking the test 
and you believe you can’t answer all the questions, answering 
the easiest questions guarantees you a higher score.
 
✓ Speed read the test’s reading comprehension questions 
before you read the selection text. In other words, if the 
reading selection is “The History of Ohio,” read the questions 
about Ohio history before reading the essay. This way, you 
know what to look for in the text as you read and you can 
skim or skip reading material you aren’t tested on.
 
✓ Know how the test is scored. If you know which parts of the 
test matter most to your score, you can focus on those parts 
and improve your score. 
 
✓ Adopt the speed-reading mindset during the test. Read aggres-
sively and hungrily. Focus like a laser beam on the page in 
front of you and concentrate with all your might. Speed reading 
improves not only reading skills but also concentration skills.
Reading for Pleasure
In all the talk of reading efficiency and reading speed, you can easily 
forget that reading is one of life’s greatest pleasures. And because 
it’s so pleasurable, savor the reading experience when you feel the 
urge. Slow down and enjoy the novels, biographies, math treatises, 
history books, or whatever type of books you love most.
Don’t hesitate to throw aside the rules of speed reading from time 
to time if doing so increases your reading pleasure. When reading 
poetry, you want to vocalize. You want to hear and revel in the 
sounds of the words. Reading the speeches of the great orators 
is much more rewarding when you slow down to hear the words. 
Make your own rules when it comes to pleasure reading. You can 
slow down or speed up, vocalize or not, as you please.
My hope is that discovering how to speed read allows you to get 
your obligatory reading done more quickly so you can get to your 
pleasure reading sooner.

T
his part of tens chapter offers — count ’em — ten fundamental 
techniques for improving your reading speed. These suggestions 
represent the basics of speed reading. You can adopt these tech-
niques and get a big head start in your speed reading adventures.
Make the Speed-Reading 
Commitment
Half the task of becoming a speed reader is making a commitment 
to read faster. By now you’ve spent quite a bit of time as a reader, 
and you’ve probably fallen into some slow reading habits. You’re 
used to hearing the words as you read them or regress or dawdle 
when you read. You don’t go at it conscientiously with the goal of 
getting as much meaning as you can from your reading. To be a 
speed reader, you must renounce slow reading habits and make 
the commitment to reading in an entirely different way.
Focus Like a Laser Beam
Speed reading requires more brainpower, concentration, and 
determination on the reader’s part. To speed read, you must focus 
intensely — and not just on the author’s words. As well as taking 
in the words, you have to be attuned to the flow of ideas and the 

Part V: The Part of Tens 
232
author’s strategies for presenting his or her argument. You distin-
guish between the main ideas and the details as you read. You’re 
aware of your reading goals and, to meet those goals, you decide 
when to slow down and speed up in the course of your reading. 
(See “Vary Your Reading Rate” later in this chapter for more on 
when to change up your speed.)
See It, Don’t Say It
In the act of reading, most people vocalize (hear the words as they 
see them on the page). But vocalizing slows you down, so seeing 
words without hearing them is an essential skill if you want to be a 
speed reader.
To keep from hearing words when you read, turn off your ears. Try 
to squelch your inner voice. If you move your lips when you read, 
try chewing gum or placing a pen or pencil between your lips. 
Occupying your mouth and lips while you read prevents you from 
moving your lips — and from hearing the words as you read them. 
Head to Chapter 2 for more on vocalizing and how to stop it.
Resist the Regression Urge
Regression is the term reading educators use for rereading. People 
regress for different reasons, but whatever the cause, it slows 
down reading and lowers comprehension. (Chapter 2 gives you the 
lowdown on the causes of regression.)
To prevent yourself from regressing, resist the urge. When you 
feel the need to reread, just keep chugging along. You may be 
surprised to discover that rereading isn’t as necessary as you 
thought, and you’ll develop more confidence in your reading and 
find yourself regressing less and less.
Widen Your Vision Span
A primary goal of speed reading is to be able to read many words 
at once. To accomplish this feat, you must widen your vision span 
(the number of words you can read horizontally and vertically on 
a page). The more words you can see and understand at once, the 
faster you can read.
A good speed reader can take in 10 to 14 words at a time. In 
your reading, get in the habit of taking in four or more words at 
a stretch. You can do that by seeing and processing the words 

 Chapter 14: Ten Quick Techniques to Improve Your Reading Speed 233
as images, not as sounds, and by literally widening your vision. 
Instead of reading word by word, try to read phrase by phrase or 
sentence by sentence.
Preread It
Before visiting a foreign country, most people consult a guidebook 
to decide what to visit. The guidebook gives them the flavor of the 
country and points them to outstanding places that are worth visit-
ing. Similarly, you can increase your reading speed by prereading 
your document (looking at its landmarks before you start reading 
it). If you’re reading a book, glance at the table of contents and 
index. If you’re reading an article, read the headings, subheadings, 
captions, pull quotes, graphs, and charts first.
Prereading helps you set your reading goals and points you to the 
areas of interest. Maybe only a few parts of an article are worth 
your time — prereading helps you locate these parts.
Vary Your Reading Rate
Just because you’re a supersonic speed reader doesn’t mean you 
always read at lightning speed. Part of being a speed reader is 
understanding when to slow down and when to speed up.
When you get stuck in traffic or find yourself on a slick stretch of 
highway, you slow down for safety’s sake to make sure you have 
better control of your car. The same is true of reading. When you 
come to a hard-to-understand passage or a paragraph that requires 
more than the usual amount of attention, slow down a bit. Reading 
isn’t the act of seeing words on the page but rather the act of com-
prehending the words, and sometimes slowing down is necessary 
for comprehension.
And when you come to a passage or paragraph that doesn’t 
require as much attention, go full speed ahead.
Read for the Main Ideas
You can’t be a speed reader and a stickler for details. Too much 
attention to detail or a reverence for minor arguments can keep 
you from quickly recognizing and comprehending the author’s 
main ideas or themes. In your reading, see whether you can 
sense how the material you’re reading is structured around its 

Part V: The Part of Tens 
234
main theme or idea, and when you find where that theme or idea 
is located, pounce on it. Your goal is to get the gist of what the 
author is saying, not get the flavor of all the details.
Use the Eye Sweep
When you come to the end of one line in your reading and need to 
go to the next line, don’t dawdle — quickly sweep your eyes to the 
next line. This practice increases your reading speed and reinforces 
the sense of urgency you need when speed reading.
 
In the beginning of your training, you may use a pacer to facilitate 
going quickly and directly to the next line. However, I don’t recom-
mend using a pacer for long; you can get in the habit of eye sweep-
ing soon enough without having to use the pacer for long.
Get Your Eyes Checked
This last one isn’t really a technique, but it’s important if you want 
to be a speed reader. The eyes, besides being the windows of the 
soul, are also the windows through which you read, and you can’t 
see very much if the windows are dirty. Your eyes need to be in 
good working order for you to reach your speed-reading potential.
When was the last time you had your eyes checked or were fitted 
for a new pair of glasses? Visit your optometrist to make sure your 
eyes are fully prepared to help you in your speed reading.

Chapter 15
Ten Exercises for Keeping 
Your Eyes Speed-Reading 
Ready
In This Chapter
▶ Strengthening your eyes
▶ Making your eye muscles more flexible
▶ Resting your peepers
E
yesight is controlled by muscles in your eye sockets and eye-
balls, and like the rest of your muscles, you can strengthen 
them through exercise. Eye strength comes in handy for speed 
reading, which taxes your eyes more than regular reading because 
it requires your eyes to cover more distance on the page. By 
making your eye muscles stronger and more flexible, you can 
improve your clarity of vision and slow down the natural eyesight 
deterioration that occurs with aging.
This chapter presents ten eye exercises to improve your eye 
health and, by connection, your speed reading. These exercises 
help you strengthen, rest, and make your eye muscles more flex-
ible so that your eyes can jump quickly across the page and you 
can be a better speed reader.
Eye Squeezes
Doing eye squeezes relaxes your eyes, makes your eye muscles 
more flexible, and increases the flow of blood and oxygen to your 
eyes and face. This exercise takes about three minutes:
 
1. As you inhale deeply and slowly, open your eyes and 
mouth as wide as you can and stretch out all the muscles 
of your face.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
236
 
2. As you exhale, close and squeeze your eyes as tightly as 
you can while also squeezing all the muscles of your face, 
neck, and head and clenching your jaws.
 
3. Hold your breath and continue squeezing for 30 seconds.
 
4. Repeat Steps 1 through 3 four more times, take a short 
break, and then do another set of five squeezes.
 
Don’t attempt eye squeezes in an office or other location where 
other people can see you. Your eyes are closed during part of 
this exercise, so trust me when I say that you look awfully strange 
while you’re doing it.
Thumb-to-Thumb Glancing
Thumb-to-thumb glancing works the muscles in your eye sockets 
that control peripheral vision and stretches the eye muscles in 
general to make them healthier and more flexible.
 
To get the most from this exercise, try to glance at your thumbs 
without moving your head.
 
1. Sitting or standing, look straight ahead, stretch your arms 
out to your sides, and stick up your thumbs.
 
2. Without turning your head, glance back and forth 
between your left and right thumbs ten times.
 
3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 three times.
Tree Pose
The tree pose is a yoga balancing exercise that’s essentially a more 
advanced version of thumb-to-thumb glancing (covered in the pre-
ceding section). It works your peripheral vision and makes your 
eye muscles more flexible. You can’t cheat on this exercise (not 
that you’d try) because if you do it incorrectly, you’ll topple over. 
The tree pose exercise takes about five minutes, including resting 
time between sets.
 
Do this exercise standing beside a chair or table — something you 
can grab onto if you start to fall.
 
1. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart and stare at a 
fixed point eight or ten feet in front of your nose.
 
2. Raise your hands and press your palms together at chest 
level.

 Chapter 15: Ten Exercises for Keeping Your Eyes Speed-Reading Ready 237
 
3. Maintaining your balance, slowly raise your left foot to 
knee level.
 
 Or, if you want to make like a true yogi, place your left foot 
on your inner right thigh.
 
4. Without moving your head, turn your eyes as far as you 
can to the left and focus on an object in the farthest 
corner of your left-hand field of vision and then do the 
same to your right.
 
 If you move your head, you’ll lose your balance.
 
5. Repeat Step 4 for 30 seconds, maintaining the balanced 
position, and then lower your left foot to the ground.
 
6. Repeat Steps 1 through 5, raising your right foot and bal-
ancing on your left.
Do three sets, standing on your left and right foot for each set.
Eye Rolling
The next time someone rolls his eyes at you, don’t get angry — 
congratulate him for giving his eyes a workout. As an exercise, 
eye rolling strengthens the extra-ocular muscles of the eye socket 
that control the position of the eyeball and makes your eyes more 
flexible.
Instead of finding exasperating occasions to roll your eyes, try the 
following exercise, which only takes about a minute.
 
1. Sit looking straight ahead.
 
2. Roll your eyes clockwise and blink.
 
3. Roll your eyes counterclockwise and blink.
 
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 five times.
Eye Writing
This exercise gets you to move your eyes in ways unrelated to 
normal seeing, which gives them a good workout. Like eye rolling 
(discussed in the preceding section), eye writing exercises the 
extra-ocular muscles of the eye socket and is especially good for 
increasing the eyeball’s flexibility and range of motion. Eye writing 
couldn’t be simpler:

Part V: The Part of Tens 
238
 
1. Look at the wall on the other side of the room (or the wall 
that is farthest away from you).
 
2. Imagine that you’re writing your name on the wall with 
your eyes.
 
 In other words, move your eyes as you would move a paint-
brush if you were painting the letters of your name on the 
wall. Try writing your name in block letters and then in cur-
sive letters. Write your name large. Be sure to dot your i’s 
and cross your t’s.
The 10-10-10
This exercise is called the 10-10-10 because it asks you to stare 
at an object that is ten or more feet away for ten seconds every 
ten minutes when you’re reading intently. The 10-10 strengthens 
the eye’s ciliary muscle, a very important muscle that changes the 
shape of the eye lens so you can focus on nearer objects or farther 
objects. Here’s how you do it:
 
1. Look up from your reading and focus on an object that is 
at least 10 feet away.
 
2. Focus on the object for 10 seconds and return to your 
reading.
 
3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 every 10 minutes.
Athletes, especially baseball players, have very strong ciliary 
muscles in their eyes. They have to be able to track a fast-moving 
ball as it moves from a distance to points closer and closer to their 
bodies. Imagine for a minute that you’re a batter watching a pitch 
come toward you or you’re an outfielder watching a fly ball come 
your way. You can feel the ciliary muscles in your eyes changing 
shape.
Change of Focus
Like the 10-10-10 in the preceding section, this exercise increases 
the strength and flexibility of the ciliary muscles used in focusing. 
After age 40, you lose 10 percent of the strength in your ciliary 
muscles every year, so this exercise is especially good for people 
in their fourth decade and beyond. Follow these steps:

 Chapter 15: Ten Exercises for Keeping Your Eyes Speed-Reading Ready 239
 
1. Hold your index finger five or six inches in front of your 
nose and focus on your fingernail for about 5 seconds 
until you can see it clearly.
 
2. Over about 5 seconds, slowly move your focus to an 
object eight or ten feet in front of you and focus on it 
until you see it clearly.
 
3. Slowly move your focus back to your thumbnail over 
about 5 seconds.
 
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 ten times.
Palming
Palming is a technique for resting the eyes. When duty calls and 
you must keep reading in spite of tired eyes, take a 3- to 5-minute 
break and practice this technique. Your eyes will thank you for it.
 
You can also rest your neck and shoulders while palming.
 
1. Rub your palms together to warm them.
 
2. Place your bent elbows on your desk or table and cup 
your hands with your palms facing toward you.
 
3. Close your eyes and slowly lower your eyes and head 
onto the palms of your hands, trying to keep any light 
from penetrating between your fingers.
 
4. Breathing slowly, rest on your cupped hands for 3 to 5 
minutes without applying pressure to your eyeballs, and 
think of a happy occurrence or beautiful place.
Hooded Eyes
Hooded eyes is another technique for relaxing your eyes; do this 
exercise two or three times when your eyes need a quick timeout.
 
1. Close your eyes halfway and concentrate on stopping 
your eyelids from trembling.
 
 As you concentrate on your eyelids, you’re really relaxing 
your eyes.
 
2. With your eyes still half closed, gaze at a faraway object.
 
 Your eyes stop trembling.

Eye Massage
You’ve probably tried this one before. Massaging the eyes is as 
good for the eyeballs as a shoulder or neck massage is for those 
areas. But easy does it — you’re not doing a Swedish massage or 
anything.
 
1. Close your eyes.
 
2. Gently roll your fingertips over your eyelids, massaging 
your eyes for a moment or two until they start to relax.
Don’t press too hard! While you’re at it, you may give your temples 
and forehead a light massage.

Ten Tips for Making 
Your Speed-Reading 
Skills Permanent
In This Chapter
▶ Redoubling your commitment to being a strategic speed reader
▶ Sharpening your speed-reading mechanics
▶ (Re)checking your progress periodically
T
o be a speed reader, you have to keep your speed-reading 
skills up to snuff. Unless you sharpen your skills, they erode 
over time. This brief chapter is for people who have become speed 
readers and want to prevent their speed-reading skills from slip-
ping. It explains a handful of actions you can take to make your 
speed-reading skills permanent.
Renew Your Commitment
Speed reading is more than just a matter of acquiring speed-
reading techniques. You also have to make the commitment 
to being a speed reader, and after you become a speed reader, 
renew your commitment from time to time.
Tell yourself, “I want to read faster and get more out of my read-
ing,” and then think of steps you can take to reach this goal:
 
✓ Don’t vocalize when you read. (See Chapter 2 for more on 
vocalizing.)
 
✓ Make a conscious commitment to read more than one word at 
a time. Chapter 6 gives you the skinny on reading in clumps.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
242
 
✓ Read with more concentration.
 
✓ Expand your vision span so you can take in more words when 
you read. Chapter 6 can help you out here as well.
Expand Your Reading Vision
To make your speed-reading skills permanent, continue to expand 
your reading vision by using the guidelines in Chapter 6. As 
Chapter 3 explains in loving detail, your eyes fixate on words or 
groups of words in the act of reading. As you read from left to right 
across the page, your eyes take in 1 to 14 words at a time. The 
more words you can read at once, the faster you can read.
Keep working at taking in more words at once. When you come to 
the end of one line, don’t swing your eyes to the start of the next line. 
Move to a place partway into the next line and start reading there. 
Similarly, don’t read to the end of each line — try to take in the last 
four to five words without moving your eyes to the end of the line.
Shush Your Inner Reading Voice
Because I can’t say it enough, I’m going to say it again: To be a 
speed reader, you must silence your inner reading voice. You 
must cultivate the habit of reading without hearing your own voice 
recite the words.
Dropping the vocalization habit (discussed in Chapter 2) is the 
first big hurdle you must cross to become a speed reader, and you 
have to keep that persistent voice quiet for continued success.
When you’re actively engaged in speed reading and you hear the 
voice, make a conscientious effort to suppress it. Focus on the 
shapes of words. Try to process the words and take in their mean-
ing with your visual faculties only.
Read More Often
If you want your speed-reading skills to be permanent, you have to 
make reading a part of your daily life. When you read more often, 
you acquire more vocabulary words and therefore become a faster 
reader. Because your vocabulary is larger, you don’t have to stop 
as often to ponder what a word you don’t know means.

 Chapter 16: Ten Tips for Making Your Speed-Reading Skills Permanent 243
Reading more often also increases your breadth of knowledge, and 
that in turn increases your reading speed. For example, you don’t 
have to stop to think about background information because you 
already know it from your previous reading.
Rather than watch TV before you go to bed, read a book or maga-
zine. Your dreams will be sweeter, I assure you.
Be a Goal-Oriented Reader
No matter what the endeavor, your chances of succeeding are 
better if you set goals for yourself. This fact of life is why speed 
readers set goals for themselves when they read. If you ask your-
self, “Why am I reading this and what do I want to get from this 
reading?” before you start reading a book or article, you’re able to 
read much more aggressively.
Asking that simple question makes your reading much more pro-
ductive because you establish goals when you read. As you read 
along, you can skim or skip material that doesn’t help you reach 
your goals. And if you come to paragraphs that get to the heart of 
why you’re reading, you can read those paragraphs more carefully 
and get more out of your reading. Chapter 10 helps you figure out 
how to get what you need and get out.
Enlarge Your Vocabulary
To continue to be a speed reader, you must always work to enlarge 
your vocabulary. The larger your vocabulary is, the faster you can 
read because you don’t have to stop and ponder as many unknown 
words.
Chapter 12 explains how you acquire new words and how to 
actively seek out vocab expansion. It also presents common pre-
fixes, roots, and suffixes to help you decode new words as you 
encounter them.
Be a Strategic Reader
Above and beyond reading mechanics, you must continue to refine 
your strategic reading abilities if you want to be a long-term speed 
reader. For example, you must read word groups and thought 
units, not words alone (see Chapter 7). Another helpful habit: 
Become a bird’s-eye view reader — instead of burying your nose in 
the pages, read from on high, noting such points as how the author 

Part V: The Part of Tens 
244
is makes her argument and whether you can skim or skip certain 
paragraphs (or even the entire work). Chapters 10 and 11 cover 
the habits of these wily readers.
Occasionally Time Yourself
You can tell for certain whether your speed-reading skills are 
eroding by timing yourself when you read. Chapter 5 offers a test 
to measure your reading speed (and Appendix B has a place for 
recording your scores on this test). From time to time, take the 
test in Chapter 5 to see whether your reading speed is decreasing 
or increasing. If you find yourself slipping, try to determine why 
and then brush up on the appropriate skills.
Do Your Exercises
I hope you complete all the exercises in this book on your way to 
becoming a speed reader. And I recommend doing the exercises 
again to keep up your speed-reading skills. In fact, I recommend 
doing the exercises again and again and again.
For that matter, next time you’re reading a newspaper, book, or 
magazine, pretend you’re doing a speed-reading test. Apply all you 
know about speed reading to the text in front of you. See whether 
you can tackle your newspaper article, book chapter, or magazine 
article like a tried-and-true speed reader.
Visit the Optometrist
Your ability to speed read is only as good as your ability to see 
words on the page. If you aren’t yet 40, you’re in for a surprise 
where your eyes are concerned (and if you’re over 40, you prob-
ably know what I’m talking about).
Starting around age 40, your eyesight starts to deteriorate. You 
have trouble reading small print. You have to hold the menu far-
ther and farther from your face as the years go by, until by age 50 
your arm isn’t long enough and you end up with stew when you 
thought you ordered steak.
To avoid such culinary disasters and keep your speed reading up 
to par, have your eyes checked regularly after the age of 40, and get 
yourself a pair of glasses if necessary. You can’t speed read without 
them. If your peepers are already healthy, thank your lucky stars 
and then keep them that way with the eye exercises in Chapter 15.

Part VI
Appendixes

In this part...
You’ve found them — the appendixes stashed away 
at the end of this book. Appendix A lists the 2,000 
most common words in the English language; these words 
represent about 75 percent of the words you encounter 
in your reading, so knowing them can greatly increase 
your reading speed and comprehension. Appendix B is 
a worksheet for tracking your scores on the exercises 
in this book.

Appendix A
Uncovering the Prime Words
T
his appendix lists prime words and discusses how these 
common words can improve your vocabulary (an essential 
speed-reading tool) and put you on the fast track to speedy read-
ing. It also lists these 2,000 words so you can get cracking.
Discovering Prime Words
To find out what the most commonly used words are, my com-
pany, The Literacy Company, downloaded all the books available 
on Project Gutenberg (www.gutenberg.org), the online digital 
library consisting of more than 13,000 books (about 548 million 
words altogether). We entered all the books in a database and then 
queried the database to find out the 2,000 most popular words.
I call these words prime words because they’re the primary words 
you encounter in your reading. Based on our experiment with 
Project Guttenberg, these prime words represent 75 percent of all 
the words in the English language. That means that you can master 
the prime words and rest assured that you know 75 percent of the 
vocabulary words you need in your reading.
After you get the prime words down, your reading comprehension, 
retention, and recall increase because knowing the prime words 
gives you these advantages in your reading:
 
✓ You recognize the words immediately, so you don’t have to 
decode them.
 
✓ Your eyes don’t fixate on the words (so you can read them as 
part of word groups).
Prime Words List
Following are lists of the 2,000 prime words divided into 10 groups 
of about 200 words per group. Group 1 lists the most common 
prime words; group 10 lists the least common.

Part VI: Appendixes 
248
Read this list to make sure that you know all the prime words. 
When you come to a word you don’t know, circle it, and go back 
and research the circled words to get their meanings. You may 
have to look up the words you circled in a dictionary.
 
Although this book is about speed reading, don’t feel like you have 
sit down and cram a bunch of unfamiliar words into your brain this 
afternoon. The way to eat an elephant is one bite a time, so take out 
your fork and tackle these prime words in whatever manageable 
chunks work for you.

Appendix B
Your Speed-Reading 
Progress Worksheet
T
his appendix is a worksheet that you can use to track your 
progress on various exercises in this book. It also explains 
how to calculate your WPM (word-per-minute) reading rate and 
your ERR (effective reading rate) for any given reading selection.
Calculating Your WPM Rate 
and ERR
Some of the exercises in this book ask you to calculate your WPM 
reading rate and your ERR. Chapter 5 explains these rates in detail; 
you can use the following formulas to calculate them.
Use this formula to calculate your WPM (word-per-minute) reading 
rate:
 
_______________ Number of words in the reading selection
÷ _______________ Time to read the reading selection (enter 
fractions of minutes as decimals)
= ________________ WPM
Use this formula to calculate your ERR (effective reading rate):
 _______________ WPM rate
× _______________ Percentage of comprehension questions 
answered correctly (enter as a decimal)
= ________________ ERR

Use this worksheet to enter your scores for exercises in this book. 
I recommend doing these exercises more than once, and for that 
reason, I have included places for recording more than one score 
by date for each test. Some exercises in this book don’t require 
you to enter scores in this worksheet, and I didn’t include places 
here for recording your scores on those exercises.
