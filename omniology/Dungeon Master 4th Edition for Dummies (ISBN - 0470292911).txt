About the Authors
Bill Slavicsek began playing the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS roleplaying game with
his friends during his formative teenage years in New York City. This was in
1977, the same year that Star Wars and Terry Brooks’s The Sword of Shannara
debuted. This trilogy of epic fantasy combined with comic books and horror
novels to forever influence Bill’s outlook on life and entertainment. In 1986,
Bill’s hobby became his career when he joined the staff of West End Games.
There, as an editor and game designer, Bill worked on a number of board
games and roleplaying games, including Ghostbusters, Paranoia, Star Wars:
The Roleplaying Game, and Torg: Roleplaying the Possibility Wars. Later, Bill
went on to use his vast knowledge of the Star Wars films and associated
extensions to write two editions of A Guide to the Star Wars Universe for
Lucasfilm, Ltd. (published by Del Rey Books). 
1n 1993, Bill joined the staff of TSR, Inc., then publishers of the DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS game lines, as a game designer and editor. His design credits for the
company include the Alternity Science Fiction Game (which he co-designed
with Richard Baker), the d20 Modern Roleplaying Game, the d20 Star Wars
Roleplaying Game, the Star Wars Miniatures Game, Urban Arcana, Council of
Wyrms, and the EBERRON Campaign Setting. 
Since 1997, Bill has been the R&D Director for Roleplaying Games, Book
Publishing, and D&D Games for Wizards of the Coast, Inc., the company that
now publishes all DUNGEONS & DRAGONS novels and game products. He oversaw
the creation of the d20 Roleplaying Game System and the latest editions of
the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. Bill leads a talented staff of game designers,
developers, and editors who produce award-winning game products for
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS and other d20 System game lines, including roleplaying
game supplements and accessories, adventures and campaign books, and
prepainted plastic miniatures. He lives with his wife Michele, their cat Pooh,
and more comics, toys, and books than he knows what to do with — and
that’s okay by him. 
Richard Baker is an award-winning game designer and a best-selling author.
He’s worked on the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game lines since 1991. Rich traces his
D&D experience back to 1979, when he began playing the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
game as a 7th-grader. He spent a significant amount of his high school and
college years playing D&D at every opportunity, and after serving as a sur-
face warfare officer in the United States Navy, Rich decided to take a shot at
working on the game he grew up playing — and so he joined the staff of TSR,
Inc., and became a game designer. 

Rich’s list of D&D design credits numbers over 60 game products, including
the Origins Award–winning Birthright Campaign Setting, the Alternity Science
Fiction Roleplaying Game (which he co-designed with Bill Slavicsek), and the
3rd Edition DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. He has also served as creative director
for the Alternity and FORGOTTEN REALMS game lines. As an author, Rich has
published ten fantasy and science fiction novels, including Swordmage, the
Last Mythal trilogy, and the New York Times bestseller Condemnation.
Rich is currently employed as a senior game designer at Wizards of the Coast,
Inc., and works every day on new products for the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game.
He married his college sweetheart Kim in 1991; they have two daughters, 
Alex and Hannah. When he’s not writing (a rare occurrence), Rich likes to
hike in the Cascades, play wargames, and root for the Philadelphia Phillies —
because somebody has to.
James Wyatt is a game designer and sometime novelist who joined the
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS design staff in 2000. He credits The Lord of the Rings and
D&D with starting him on a winding life path that has taken him through a
college degree in religion and a Master of Divinity degree, on through a short
stint as an ordained minister in two United Methodist churches in Ohio, and
still onward past some time as a technical writer before finally landing at
Wizards of the Coast.
James won Origins Awards for his work on the FORGOTTEN REALMS adventure
City of the Spider Queen and the EBERRON Campaign Setting, and he was the
main designer for the award-winning Oriental Adventures sourcebook. He
spent three years on various teams as one of the lead designers for the fourth
edition of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game and compiled wisdom from the great-
est minds in gaming for the fourth edition Dungeon Master’s Guide. He’s also
the author of three fantasy novels set in EBERRON.
James is now the Lead Story Designer for DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, which means
he leads a team of writers and creative geniuses to shape the story and
worlds of the D&D game, as well as writing the polished prose of background
and flavorful material for the D&D rulebooks. His wife, Amy, is an artist, actor,
home-school teacher, minister, and spiritual director as well as a great sound-
ing board for his novel and game ideas. James and Amy have one son, Carter,
who wants his father’s job.

Dedication
Bill Slavicsek: To DMs everywhere, past, current, and future. The world
needs you, now more than ever. Dream it up, play it, and have fun!
Richard Baker: To Kim, Alex, and Hannah for putting up with a lot of work in
evenings and on weekends for many months now. “Understanding” is an
understatement.
James Wyatt: To Carter, whose boundless creativity is constantly inspiring,
even (or especially) when I can’t keep up.
Author’s Acknowledgments
Bill Slavicsek: The newest edition of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game owes its
existence to a lot of talented people. The work that James, Rich, and I have
done on this For Dummies book would not have been possible if not for the
original effort of a formidable team of creatives and business people. Thank
you to my creative team on the massive redesign project, which included Rob
Heinsoo, Andy Collins, James Wyatt, Mike Mearls, Chris Perkins, Kim Mohan,
Michele Carter, and Jeremy Crawford. Also thank you to the brand team, who
help bring D&D products to market, which includes Liz Schuh, Scott Rouse,
Kieren Chase, Sarah Girard, Linae Foster, and Martin Durham.
I have to also acknowledge the efforts of the rest of my game design staff.
This amazing collection of designers, developers, and editors work every day
to push the envelope and expand the horizons of our products, and as much
as I lead them, they influence the way I think about and approach game
design and D&D. Every part of this For Dummies book owes at least a little to
the ideas and work of Richard Baker, Greg Bilsland, Logan Bonner, Bart
Carroll, Bruce Cordell, Peter Lee, Stephen Radney-MacFarland, Julia Martin,
David Noonan, Peter Schaefer, Stephen Schubert, Chris Sims, Rodney
Thompson, Rob Watkins, Jennifer Clarke Wilkes, Steve Winter, and Chris
Youngs.
Finally, thanks to everyone at Wiley Publishing who worked with us on this
book, including Amy Fandrei, Jean Nelson, and Virginia Sanders, and to every-
one at Wizards of the Coast, Inc., who help us make great games and other
great products on a regular basis.

Richard Baker: Many people of exceptional creativity have worked on the
D&D game over the years. Without the work of game designers, editors, and
artists such as Gary Gygax, Dave Arneson, Jim Ward, Kim Mohan, Zeb Cook,
Jeff Grubb, Steve Winter, Bruce Nesmith, Tim Brown, Troy Denning, Roger
Moore, Ed Greenwood, Mike Carr, Harold Johnson, Andrea Hayday, Jon
Pickens, Lawrence Schick, Skip Williams, Dave Sutherland, Jeff Easley, Larry
Elmore, and countless others, D&D would not have grown into the beloved
hobby of millions of fans across the world. Countless other authors, artists,
developers, and editors have contributed over the years; we’re sorry that we
can’t thank them all.
A special acknowledgment is in order for Peter Atkinson, Ryan Dancey, and
other folks who were instrumental in bringing the D&D game and many of its
designers to Wizards of the Coast, Inc. Through their efforts, they reinvented
and reinvigorated the game at a difficult and crucial time in its life cycle.
I’d like to add a special thank you to good friends and colleagues who have
shared in my own D&D games over the years, including Ed Stark, John
Rateliff, David Eckelberry, Shaun and Miranda Horner, David Wise, Thomas
Reid, David Noonan, James Wyatt, Warren Wyman, Duane Maxwell, Andy
Weedon, and Dale Donovan. I’ve had a lot of fun saving the world with you
guys!
James Wyatt: It has been a privilege and an honor to work with so many
people of such tremendous genius and creativity on such an exciting project
as the D&D game. I wouldn’t have this job and be where I am today if it
weren’t for a few key people: Bill Connors, Dave Gross, Bill Slavicsek, and
Rich Baker. Even more, I wouldn’t know a thing about being a Dungeon
Master if it weren’t for the great authors of Dungeon Masters Guides past,
those who came before and on whose shoulders I was lucky enough to stand:
Gary Gygax, Zeb Cook, and Monte Cook. Then there’s the DMs I’ve been lucky
enough to play with at various times over the past eight years: Dave Noonan,
Ed Stark, Rich Baker, Warren Wyman, Andy Collins, and Bill Slavicsek. 
I also want to thank the Imperium Romanum crowd, my gaming group “back
home”: Paul Gries, David Silbey, Mark Lawrence, David Lieb, David
Wallenstein, Matt Lewkowicz, Doug Leonhardt, and several others who
passed through from time to time. Thanks for everything, folks.

Dungeon Master 4th Edition For Dummies 

Foreword
I
t is time to step up your game.
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS has been reinvented with its 4th Edition. A lot of sacred
cows have met their maker, a plethora of mechanics have been rethought and
overhauled, a host of basic tenets questioned and made anew. Traditional
classes have been reforged with an eye towards playability and old monsters
have returned with a nod to ease of use. Yet the core of D&D remains, the
part of that is absolutely necessary for the game to be. The art that is the
heart of the game.
The fine art of Dungeon Mastering.
Being a DM is a quantum leap up from merely playing the game. You aren’t
keeping track of a single character but rather coordinating a full-fledged
world. You’re not worrying just about what is behind the next door but about
how the epic adventure will ultimately resolve. You have to be ready for any-
thing that a group of creative, inventive, and downright devious players will
throw at you over the course of a game session. You are host, team leader,
narrator, head bad guy, playwright, supporting cast, ringleader, and ringmas-
ter, all at the same time.
It is a very tall order. Fortunately, Bill, Rich, and James put it all together in
one package for you.
I can vouch for Bill’s DM credentials. For many years now, a group of us cre-
ative types, present and former members of Wizards of the Coast, have gath-
ered at his house every Thursday night for our weekly game. Bill has used us
as a test-bed for new projects he has worked on, including the Star Wars RPG,
d20 Modern, EBERRON, the new arrangement of the Planes, and now 4th
Edition. Yes, we get to play the first drafts (and take the initial lumps) of the
new systems. It’s a tough job, and Bill makes it a heckuva lot of fun.
Rich is no slouch in the DM department either, as an author and game
designer with world-building credentials from way back, and has spent a
small eternity managing Wizard of the Coast’s sprawling, chaotic, eternal
campaign, the FORGOTTEN REALMS. Oh, and in one of his first projects, for a
D&D-in-space campaign called Spelljammer, he put battleship guns on an
asteroid and took it out for a spin. So he thinks outside the box as well as any
devious player.

Dungeon Master 4th Edition For Dummies 
xx
And James Wyatt brings it all together and up to date as the lead designer on
the new Dungeon Master’s Guide for 4th Edition. This one volume is the sum-
mation of over 25 years of D&D history, explaining not only the what and how
of running a campaign, but the why as well. James produced the most read-
able and well-reasoned version of this classic and necessary book, and now
helps distill it into this format.
Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition For Dummies gives you a box of tools. Dungeon
Master 4th Edition For Dummies shows you what you can build with those
tools. Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition For Dummies gives you a rainbow of
paints. Dungeon Master 4th Edition For Dummies shows you what you can 
portray with those paints. Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition For Dummies
opens the door to a new universe. Dungeon Master 4th Edition For Dummies
goes through that door, and shows you how to create your own worlds and
delight and entertain your players. 
There is a whole new universe out there — it’s time to go play.
Enjoy.
Jeff Grubb
Co-founder of the Dragonlance campaign setting and co-creator of the
FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign setting, Jeff is the author of over a dozen novels,
thirty short stories, and more game products than is either polite or proper
to mention. When he’s not building worlds for computer game companies,
he’s making up Chuck Norris jokes about the 4E fighter exploits. Some of his
characters in Bill’s Thursday Night Games have been Moondog Greenberg the
kabalistic biker, Whappamanga the Wookiee, Captain Keldon of the interpla-
nar ship Dragon Roar, and Emm the Inappropriately Exuberant warlord.
Dungeon Master 4th Edition For Dummies 

Introduction
T
he DUNGEONS & DRAGONS roleplaying game has been exciting and expanding
the imaginations of players around the world for more than 30 years. The
key components to a good (or better yet, great) game of D&D include enthusi-
astic players; a fun adventure; and a good (or better yet, great) Dungeon Master.
The Dungeon Master (also known as the DM) applies imagination, game rules,
and creative flair to make every game session fun and memorable for the entire
game group. Indeed, DMs firmly believe that the role they take on in the D&D
game provides the most rewarding, creative, and fun experience available.
It’s good to be the DM!
We’ve carefully crafted this book to make the role of Dungeon Master more
accessible to D&D players. Not everyone has the temperament and mindset —
or the desire — to be the DM for a gaming group. But if the idea of creating
scenarios or even entire worlds of adventure for your friends appeals to you,
you owe it to yourself to explore the role of the DM.
And, if you’re already DMing for your gaming group, the hints and tips layered
throughout this book will help you become a better DM . . . perhaps even a
great DM. Goodness knows that the D&D game — and the world, really —
needs more great DMs.
About This Book
We wrote this book because the nice folks at Wiley Publishing, Inc., liked our
previous For Dummies books and they asked us to update this book for the
4th Edition of the D&D game. But we also wrote it because we have a passion
for the D&D game, and we want to share that love with as many people as
possible. We wrote in our previous For Dummies books that the DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS game speaks to and feeds the human condition. As a game of the
imagination, D&D builds on the myths and fantasies that shape our culture. 
In an age when so many activities involve isolated people, D&D is a social
experience. Nothing else — no computer game, no board game, no movie —
comes close to delivering the interactive and unlimited adventure of the 
D&D experience.

It’s the Dungeon Master who makes much of that creative, social, and interac-
tive experience possible. Simply put, you can’t play the D&D roleplaying game
without a Dungeon Master. The DM is essential, and a good DM is worth his
or her weight in gold pieces!
Even if you’ve run a hundred games, this book provides the advice you need
to expand your gaming techniques. Experienced Dungeon Masters will find
hints, tips, and advice designed to elevate your game to new levels: From
improving your game sessions to creating adventures and crafting cam-
paigns, we cover it all. If you’ve never run a game as the DM, this book is a
great place to start. We explain the ins and outs of Dungeon Mastering and
offer plenty of advice on how to become the best DM you can be.
About This Revision
This book is a complete revision of the original Dungeon Master For Dummies,
updated to make use of the 4th Edition D&D rules. It doesn’t just update the
rules material, though. It’s revised to speak to new assumptions about the
role of the Dungeon Master and the way he or she interacts with the other
players. Frankly, it’s also rewritten to remove what would otherwise have
been a duplication of what’s already in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. The origi-
nal Dungeon Master For Dummies did such a good job of explaining how to be
a Dungeon Master that the 4th Edition Dungeon Master’s Guide learned from
its example and included a lot of the same kinds of advice! 
As an example of what we mean, take a look at Chapter 7 in this book. In the
original book, that chapter was a simple sample dungeon. Now the Dungeon
Master’s Guide (DMG) gives you a sample dungeon, so here in this book we
help you make the best use of the sample dungeon in the DMG instead.
Similarly, Chapter 8 discusses how to make the best use of Fallcrest, the
sample “home base” in the DMG, rather than creating a new base town for
you to use.
Why You Need This Book
New Dungeon Masters need this book because it’s written by D&D experts to
serve as a comprehensive guide for DMing. Even though the D&D Dungeon
Master’s Guide is a great resource, it glosses over topics we cover here in
much more detail. This book offers more examples, including a complete
adventure to complement the short dungeon in the Dungeon Master’s Guide.
2
Dungeon Master 4th Edition For Dummies 

It’s written as a training manual in a straightforward, direct manner (the For
Dummies style).
With this book, you discover facts about running the D&D game that many
seasoned DMs have never realized. Do you know how to build balanced
encounters to best challenge your party? Do you know the tricks to keeping 
a game session moving? Do you know how to wing it when your players try
something really unexpected? How do you make a ruling when they try some-
thing that goes beyond the boundaries of the game? Thanks to our years of
experience and our unprecedented access to the Wizards of the Coast’s
Research and Development department, we’ve filled this book with insider
knowledge and examples that can’t help but make you the best DM you can be.
Seasoned Dungeon Masters can always be made better, and we try to share
our knowledge and experience in every chapter of this book. The D&D game
is as unlimited as the imaginations of its players, and something fresh and
new is always waiting to be discovered. We shine a light in all the myriad cor-
ners of the game to help you find details you never knew were there, or at
least remind you of something you haven’t used in a while. We want to make
you a better DM because better DMs make for better games.
How to Use This Book
You can use this book in many ways. You can read it cover to cover, in chap-
ter order, and follow along with our loose narrative that explains the con-
cepts of Dungeon Mastering from the basics to the most advanced applications
of the role. Alternatively, you can glance at the Table of Contents or index and
jump around to the chapters, sections, or pages that most interest you. That
works fine, too.
If you’re new to the idea of being the Dungeon Master, we suggest starting
with Part I. It helps explain the DM’s role more fully and provides the founda-
tion for the chapters and parts that follow. If you’ve run a few game sessions,
explore the information in Part I to see whether you’re fully utilizing the
tricks and tools available to you. Then move on to Part II to take your DM
style to the next level. If you’re an old pro, jump to whatever section of the
book strikes your interest. Even in chapters that seem below your level of
experience, we bet you can find something new and fresh to try at the gaming
table. And we’re sure that everyone will find something exciting and fun in
the Part of Tens.
This book assumes you have at least some experience with the DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS game. If this isn’t the case, we suggest you start with this book’s
3
Introduction

companion volume, Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition For Dummies. You might
also want to buy the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Roleplaying Game Starter Set from
Wizards of the Coast.
We wrote this book assuming that, as a somewhat experienced D&D player or
DM, you have the core D&D game books — Player’s Handbook, Dungeon
Master’s Guide, and Monster Manual. We refer to these volumes often through-
out these pages. This book isn’t a replacement for any of your D&D game
books; it’s a companion piece designed to make the information in those vol-
umes clearer and easier to understand, while adding new information specifi-
cally designed to make you a better Dungeon Master.
This book’s Cheat Sheet is a handy DM screen you can use to conceal your
notes (and perhaps your die rolls) from your players. On the side that faces you,
it also presents some of the most common things you need to look up during a
game, such as the definitions of conditions, target DCs and damage numbers for
when you’re improvising, and common attack and defense modifiers.
D&D Terminology
The DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game, like other intensive activities, has a lot of
jargon that can sometimes make comprehension a bit tricky. We wrote this
book using as much plain language as possible, but you’re still going to need
to know some of the terms that long-time players take for granted.
Here’s a quick recap of a few common terms that we use over and over:
 DUNGEONS & DRAGONS: The original roleplaying game of medieval fantasy
and adventure. In the game, players take on the role of imaginary char-
acters defined by a series of statistics, cool powers, and magical abili-
ties. The game is played around a table or other comfortable location
where players can spread out books and papers and roll dice. D&D (the
short form of the name) is a game of the imagination, part group story-
telling game and part wargame. There are no winners or losers in this
game; the point is to build an exciting fantasy story through the actions
of the characters and the challenges set forth by the Dungeon Master.
 Dungeon Master: One player is the Dungeon Master (the DM). Other
players control single characters, while the DM controls all the monsters
and enemies, narrates the action, referees the game, sets up the adven-
tures, and develops the campaign. Every D&D game needs a DM.
4
Dungeon Master 4th Edition For Dummies 

 Player character: The character controlled by a player is called a player
character (PC). A player character might be a powerful fighter, a sneaky
rogue, a crafty wizard, or a charismatic cleric, for example.
 Nonplayer character: A character controlled by the Dungeon Master is
called a nonplayer character (NPC). An NPC might be a friend, a hireling,
a merchant, or a villain, for example, that the player characters interact
with in some way.
 Adventure: The player characters are adventurers in a fantastic world
of magic and monsters. Multiple PCs (controlled by players) join together
to form an adventuring party to explore dungeons and battle amazing
creatures such as dragons and trolls. Each mission (or episode of the
story) is called an adventure. An adventure might last for a single ses-
sion of play or stretch over the course of several game sessions.
 Campaign: The D&D game doesn’t have to end with a single adventure.
When the same characters continue from one adventure to another in an
ongoing storyline, the overall story is called a campaign.
 Dice: The D&D game uses dice to resolve actions and determine other
factors where the outcome isn’t certain. The twenty-sided die is the
most important, as all major actions in the game are resolved using it.
The game also uses a four-sided die, a six-sided die, an eight-sided die, a
ten-sided die, and a twelve-sided die. You often see abbreviations used
for dice where d is followed by the number of sides for that particular
die, such as d20, d4, d6, d8, d10, and d12. Sometimes you need to roll
multiple dice of a specific shape, such as three ten-sided dice, which is
abbreviated as 3d10. Sometimes you need to roll multiple dice and add a
modifier, such as two four-sided dice plus two, which is abbreviated as
2d4 + 2.
 Player’s Handbook: The first of the three books that make up the rules
of the D&D game. This volume contains the basic rules of play and char-
acter creation. No D&D player should be caught without one.
 Dungeon Master’s Guide: The second of the three books that make up
the rules of the D&D game. This volume contains the information the
Dungeon Master needs to run the game, set up adventures, build cam-
paigns, and award treasure and experience to the player characters.
 Monster Manual: The third of the three books that make up the rules 
of the D&D game. This volume is packed with monsters to challenge
even the toughest D&D heroes and contains information that every DM
needs to know.

Introduction

How This Book Is Organized
Dungeon Master 4th Edition For Dummies consists of five parts. The chapters
within each part cover specific topics in detail. In each chapter, we start with
the basics of the topic and build from there. Whenever a point needs further
clarification, we reference the appropriate chapter so you can immediately
find any additional information you need. Whenever it comes up, we also
refer you to the appropriate place in one of the core D&D game books, or
even in Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition For Dummies if we think something in
that book will help.
Part I: Running a Great Game
Dungeon Master, meet your game. Game, meet your Dungeon Master. The
chapters in this part assume you’re a new to moderately experienced DM 
and provide all kinds of tips and methods for running and improving your
D&D game. 
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering
The chapters in this part are designed to take your Dungeon Mastering skills
to the next level, with advanced discussion topics, techniques, and options.
Even experienced DMs can find something new and exciting in this part.
Part III: Creating Adventures
Ultimately, every DM wants to try his or her hand at creating an original
adventure. In this part, we provide advice and guidance on how to craft mem-
orable adventures, and we wrap up this part with a sample dungeon that
shows the techniques in action.
Part IV: Building a Campaign
This part explores methods for stringing individual adventures together to
create an ongoing campaign. Discussing themes, villains, and plots, we get to
the heart of what turns a series of adventures into a memorable and exciting
campaign.
6
Dungeon Master 4th Edition For Dummies 

Part V: The Part of Tens
No For Dummies book is complete without this section of top-ten lists. We
take this concept to a new level by presenting encounters, maps, and traps
that you can use in your own D&D games.
Bonus chapters and full-color pages
You can find three bonus chapters on the Dummies.com Web site at
www.dummies.com/go/dungeonmaster4e. The first two bonus chapters
give ten major and ten minor quests you can use as the basis for an adven-
ture or for side stories. The third bonus chapter provides ten epic-level
encounters, complete with maps, monsters, and traps.
We also included eight full-color pages filled with fantastic artwork in the
middle of this book. We hope the artwork will give you inspiration for your
next adventure!
Icons Used in This Book

Running a 
Great Game

In this part . . .
T
his part of Dungeon Master 4th Edition For Dummies
speaks to all D&D Dungeon Masters. Whether you’re
thinking about running a game of D&D, have recently
joined the ranks of DMs, or have a bit of DMing experience
under your belt, the chapters in this part provide all kinds
of tips and techniques for improving your D&D game. The
final chapter in this part walks you through using the
sample dungeon in the Dungeon Master’s Guide, helping
you jump right into the action behind the DM screen.
After mastering the techniques in the earlier chapters,
this sample dungeon makes a great practice tool to hone
your DMing skills.

Chapter 1
The Role of the Dungeon Master
In This Chapter
 Discovering the role of the Dungeon Master
 Finding what you need to play D&D
 Exploring the many expressions of Dungeon Mastering
 Understanding the goals of Dungeon Mastering
You know what DUNGEONS & DRAGONS is. It’s the original roleplaying game,
the game that inspired not only a host of other tabletop roleplaying
games, but most computer roleplaying games as well. A roleplaying game allows
players to take on the roles of characters in a story of their own creation.
Part improvisation, part wargame, the D&D game provides a unique and
unequalled experience. For a game like D&D to work, one of the players in a
group must take on a fun, exciting, creative, and extremely rewarding role —
the role of Dungeon Master.
Thanks to the presence of a Dungeon Master (DM), a D&D game can be more
interactive than any computer game, more open-ended than any novel or
movie. Using a fantastic world of medieval technology, magic, and monsters
as a backdrop, the DM has the power of the game mechanics and the imagi-
nation of all the players to work with. Whatever anyone can imagine can
come to life in the game, thanks to the robust set of rules that are the heart 
of the D&D game. The rules and imagination can take your game only so far,
however. The heights your game can reach and the fun you can have with it
depend on the creativity and involvement of the Dungeon Master.
Do you have a burning desire to create adventures or even entire D&D worlds?
Do you enjoy being at the center of the action, helping your friends have a
rollicking good time? Then maybe the role of Dungeon Master is right for you.
In this chapter, we look at the role of the Dungeon Master and see how a good
DM makes for a good game of D&D. 

What Is a DM?
A Dungeon Master is one of the players in a DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game group.
The other players each create a single character and use that character to
interact with the imaginary world depicted in the game, but the DM plays a
pivotal role that goes beyond that of the other players. In short, the Dungeon
Master runs the game. You can get along without a fighter, rogue, or cleric, 
at least for a game session or two, but it’s harder to play a game of D&D with-
out a DM.
Because the D&D game is as wide open as the imaginations of the players, 
the presence of a DM to act as a moderator, story designer, and narrator is
essential. The players interact with each other and the imaginary environ-
ment through the actions of their characters, and the DM describes each
scene, directs the action, and plays the roles of the monsters, villains, and all
the other people (the butcher, the baker, and the innkeeper) that the charac-
ters meet on every adventure.
As the DM, you aren’t competing against the players. Rather, you set up inter-
esting, exciting, even challenging situations, and then you use the game rules
to fairly and impartially allow events to play out. You don’t know how things
are going to turn out, and neither do the players. That’s one of the elements
that makes the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game so much fun. When you and the
players get together to play out a compelling group story, everybody wins!
So You Want to Be the Dungeon Master?
The Dungeon Master (or DM) plays a special role in the D&D game. The DM
controls the pace of the story and referees the action as it unfolds. The power
of creating worlds and controlling dragons resides in the hands of the DM. As
DM, you are the master of the game. The rules, the setting, the action, and
ultimately the fun all radiate from you. Sounds like something you just have
to do? Well, being the DM involves having a great deal of power. We show you
how to use that power wisely and with great responsibility so that you and
the other players have a fun experience.
We also show you that the role of DM doesn’t have to mean a lot of work and
hardship. We provide plenty of tips and shortcuts to help you along the way.
Although Dungeon Mastering can sometimes be as easy as showing up to the
game (just like the other players), more often than not the DM has to do a
little bit of upfront preparation so that the game session unfolds smoothly.
With our hints and techniques, it can look as though you spent hours work-
ing on your adventure. Granted, some DMs do spend hours on their craft, 
12
Part I: Running a Great Game 

creating the adventure before the game session, and that’s a big part of the
fun for them. But if you’re like us and you don’t have a lot of free time to
devote to your role as DM, we think you’ll appreciate the time-saving sugges-
tions we provide in this book.
Being the DM doesn’t have to be a full-time job. If you’re already a player in
another DM’s game, you might take a turn as DM for just a single session to
try your hand at the DM’s job. When you’re comfortable with it, maybe you
can take turns, alternating sessions, adventures, or campaigns so that each
player in your group gets some time behind the DM screen and some time as
a regular player. Even if you DM most of the time, it can be good to enjoy the
game from a player’s perspective once in a while.
So you want to be the Dungeon Master? From the moment we saw the origi-
nal Dungeon Master’s Guide lo those many years ago, so did we. So come
along. You’re in good company!
What Do You Need for Playing?
The D&D game has few requirements but lots of options. In addition to play-
ers, a Dungeon Master, and an adventure, you need (to a greater or lesser
extent) the following items to play the game:
 The game itself: D&D is a unique type of game, a roleplaying game,
that’s presented in three core books — Player’s Handbook, Dungeon
Master’s Guide, and Monster Manual. There’s also the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
Roleplaying Game Starter Set that comes in a box for people new to the
hobby.
 Dice: The D&D game uses a unique collection of dice, each with a different
number of sides. Dice add a random element to the game; in fact, they
turn D&D into a game (as opposed to merely an improvisational activity).
A set of D&D dice includes at least one each of the following types of dice:
Type of Dice
Abbreviation
Four-sided dice
d4
Six-sided dice
d6
Eight-sided dice
d8
Ten-sided dice
d10
Twelve-sided dice
d12
Twenty-sided dice
d20
13
Chapter 1: The Role of the Dungeon Master

In addition to the basic set of dice, it pays to have extras of certain types
of dice. For example, you might find it handy to have several extra d8s
or d10s when rolling damage for powers. The players ought to have sev-
eral sets of dice (one set per player is best) so that they don’t have to
waste time collecting the dice they need from all over the table.
 Character sheets: Every player needs a character sheet that details the
character he or she is playing. You can photocopy a character sheet out
of the Player’s Handbook or purchase a pack of deluxe character sheets.
Players should use a pencil to fill out their character sheets because the
game stats change as the character gains experience and picks up loot.
The D&D Insider Web site (www.dndinsider.com) also provides PDF
versions of the character sheet that you can download and print for per-
sonal use.
 DM screen: As DM, you need a DM screen. It provides useful charts and
tables you need in the game and helps you hide your maps and notes and
other accouterments so that the players can’t peek at what’s to come.
 Miniatures and a battle grid: D&D Dungeon Tiles provide a ready-to-use
battle grid, a play surface where your miniatures can represent tactical
situations (such as combat encounters). D&D Miniatures booster packs
contain a variety of cool monsters and hero figures that you can use to
represent characters in tactical situations. Although miniatures and a
battle grid aren’t strictly necessary, they do speed up play and help
players better visualize the fantastic situations you put their characters
in. (They’re also pretty cool and fun to collect, and you can use them to
play a more competitive version of the game, if you like.)
 Pencils and paper: D&D players need a way to keep notes, track their
progress through a dungeon, write down what kind of treasure they find,
and otherwise record important game information. For this reason, it
pays to have a lot of pencils (with good erasers), paper, and graph paper
handy during a game session.
The Expressions of Dungeon Mastering
In many ways, the Dungeon Master is the focus of a D&D game. When you
decide to become a DM, you decide to take on a special role that sets you
apart from casual and dedicated players alike. You moderate the game rules.
You set the pace of the story and action. You determine the challenges that
the player characters must face, and you give depth and reality to the game
world you create. 
It boils down to this fact: The Dungeon Master takes on a lot of functions in
the game. To help you better understand this fact, we’ve divided the role into
14
Part I: Running a Great Game 

its many expressions. This division is kind of artificial, set up so we can dis-
cuss the role of the DM in a logical and clear manner. In reality, many of these
expressions blend into each other or might not even come into play in a typi-
cal game session. Still, exploring the role of DM is easier when you look at it
in this fashion. We discuss each of these expressions of DMing in the sections
that follow, and we delve deeper into each expression in later chapters.
DM as rules moderator
When the players gather around the table for D&D, as the DM, you’re in charge.
This means that you make the call when the game rules aren’t clear or when the
rules can be interpreted in different ways. Like an umpire at a baseball game or
a referee moderating a basketball game, you have to use the rules as you under-
stand them and apply them to the situations that present themselves.
The DM also makes the call when players attempt to do something that isn’t
exactly covered by the rules. Sure, the rules clearly spell out how to make
attacks, cast spells, and use physical skills such as Athletics. The fun of a role-
playing game such as D&D, however, is that players can — and often do — try
to have their characters accomplish amazing things that go beyond the limits
of the rules.
Just remember to be fair and consistent. If you treat every player in the same
way and follow the logic of your past rulings, everything should work out
fine. If you come up with a way to handle a specific type of action, apply that
same ruling the next time that action or something similar occurs. 
The best moderator DM has a solid understanding of the rules of the game.
Make sure that the players know about any changes (or house rules) you’re
incorporating into the game. When a situation comes up that isn’t covered by
the rules, make a decision. Don’t be afraid to ask the players for suggestions,
but remember that your decision is final. The adventure must go on, so
decide on a ruling and get back to the action of play as quickly as possible.
The DM has the ultimate authority over the game, even over something that
is clearly covered in a rulebook. Use this power wisely. If you decide to over-
turn a rule for the game, clearly explain to the players why you’re doing it
and then make a note of the change so that you can fairly and consistently
apply the rule change in the future. The same goes for house rules and new
rules you create. The players must trust you in this role, or the game will
come crashing down around you. Nothing earns that trust better than when
you make fair and consistent rulings on a regular basis.
So, the best moderator DM is fair and consistent and has a solid grasp on the
rules.
15
Chapter 1: The Role of the Dungeon Master

DM as narrator
Your campaign exists in your imagination and the imaginations of the players.
For everyone to get the most out of the game, the DM must serve as a narra-
tor for the action.
This doesn’t mean that you tell the players what their characters do. The
decisions regarding player character actions should always rest in the hands
of the players. Instead, you serve as the portal into the imaginary world, the
eyes and ears (and other senses) of the characters. If you do this well, the
game really comes alive.
As the narrator, you describe what happens as the player characters interact
with the world. You tell them what they see, what they hear, what they smell.
(But never what they do!) In a roleplaying game, the action scrolls across the
imagination of the players, and anything you can do to paint a vivid and accu-
rate picture of the scene makes the action more immediate and immersive.
You describe the monster that just leaped out of the clinging shadows. You
describe the stench of evil that wafts out of the dark, gaping chasm. Don’t
just give the players the facts. Make sure to tell them what their characters
see, hear, smell, and even what they feel and taste when appropriate. Make
sure to describe everything from the player characters’ point of view. Don’t
reveal anything they shouldn’t have immediate access to, such as what’s
beyond the closed door or what’s inside the locked chest. Be descriptive,
using words that show the players what’s around their characters — what
they can see and otherwise sense about the immediate environment.
The Dungeon Master’s Guide discusses the ins and outs of narrative descrip-
tion in the sections on “Narration” (pages 22–23) and “Dispensing Information”
(pages 26–27).
A good narrator DM shows players the results of their characters’ actions by
using evocative, exciting, and vibrant words and descriptions.
DM as a cast of thousands
Each player controls one character in the game. You, as the DM, control the
entire supporting cast, called nonplayer characters (NPCs). All the roles from
the bit characters to the prominent allies and adversaries that inhabit your
campaign are yours to use as you see fit. These are the people (and creatures)
that the player characters interact with, and they’re all yours to breathe life
into. Most of your NPC cast of thousands will require only a key descriptor or
16
Part I: Running a Great Game 

a single detail that helps you play a role. Many NPCs can even be improvised
on the spot as the need arises. You need to create full-on game statistics for
an NPC only if that character is an opponent or a major ally. Otherwise, just
like in the movies, you need to put together only as much as you think you’re
going to use in the game.
Whether an NPC serves as a walk-on or has a minor or major role in the story,
play each one as an individual. Roleplay! Nothing makes an NPC come alive
like roleplaying a key feature to give him or her personality and pizzazz. For
major NPCs, such as the dastardly villain or the regal king who hires the adven-
turers, roleplay to the hilt. Even the lowliest kobold minions, though, really
come alive if they have distinctive voices — even if all they ever say is, “I am
slain!” Ham it up, act it out, and make each character memorable in the scene.
As a cast of thousands, a good DM needs to separate his or her role as DM
from his or her role as the controller of the supporting characters. Your NPCs
shouldn’t know everything that you know about the story and the previous
actions of the player characters. Also, your NPCs shouldn’t become the
heroes of the story, outshining the player characters and stealing the spot-
light from them. Be fair (there’s that phrase again) and play each NPC within
the confines of the specific role you imagined for him or her. Sure, you want
to sometimes get the drop on the player characters, but most of the time, if
the players make smart choices or the dice fall in their favor, don’t use your
power to get the upper hand. If the player characters have set a perfect
ambush for your goblin raiders, let the goblin raiders stumble into it. 
Remember to apply the same standards you use as game moderator to your
nonplayer characters as well as to the player characters. Provide good chal-
lenges so that a good story can develop, but don’t view yourself as the play-
ers’ opponent. And don’t alter the rules to make your supporting NPCs more
powerful or important. Let that develop naturally or leave it alone and keep
the action moving.
The best DM as a cast of thousands uses a variety of voices, mannerisms,
attitudes, and accents to make each NPC interesting and unique.
DM as player
The DM as player covers some of the same ground as the DM as a cast of
thousands. However, whereas the DM as a cast of thousands really speaks to
the roleplaying aspects of D&D, the DM as player speaks to the parts of D&D
that are all game. The DM gets to play too, and much of a DM’s enjoyment
comes from rolling dice and seeing what happens — just like any of the other
players.
17
Chapter 1: The Role of the Dungeon Master

So, when the monster needs to decide what to do during an encounter, or
when the villainous lich lord ponders which of its many necromantic powers
to use, or when the hired scout weighs her options when deciding whether to
help the adventurers or flee to a safer place, that’s when the DM gets into
character, decides on a course of action, and rolls some dice.
The DM must keep a solid separation between his or her functions as a player
and the near-omniscient abilities he or she possesses as moderator, narrator,
and creator. It’s a good idea to have a plan for how monsters and other non-
player characters will behave. This plan doesn’t need to be elaborate; it just
needs to provide a guideline or two on how to run the character or monster
in an encounter. If you use a published adventure, those cues are built into
the text. If you make up your own adventure, you need to set the cues.
Cues should be simple and straightforward. Monsters usually fight to the
death, though some might attempt to flee or surrender when reduced to half
or one-quarter hit points. Some monster cues might include tactics such as
“attack the strongest defender first” or “pile on the controller or striker as
soon as you see them.” Other cues might provide guidelines on how and
when to use the monster’s special abilities. Just jot down enough information
so that you have an idea about how you want the encounter to play out. You
can always make changes on the fly, in the heat of the battle. But always stay
fair to the role of the monster, its purpose in the adventure, and what it
should reasonably be able to figure out from its own perspective (not the
near-omniscient perspective you have as DM).
The best DM as player plays fair and lets the adventure develop as it will.
DM as social director
We’ve said it before, and we’ll say it again: D&D is a social experience. As
such, the role of social director more often than not falls to the Dungeon
Master. The DM often hosts the game group, invites the players, sets the
schedule, and provides a portion of the entertainment by running the game.
Now, all these functions can be spread out among the gaming group, but we
discuss the role of social director as an expression of the DM for purposes of
explanation.
First, you must form your gaming group. This can happen naturally among
friends with a common interest, or you can go out and actively recruit play-
ers from a gaming club, in a gaming store, at school, or at work. Because it’s
hard to play D&D without a DM, the DM is the one who usually goes about
forming the gaming group.
18
Part I: Running a Great Game 

Then, you have to set up the particulars of when and where your gaming group
will meet. This is rather similar to planning a party or other social get-together.
You need a when that works for the majority of the group, a regular time when
the group will get together for the express purpose of playing D&D. This could
be every week (for example, every Thursday evening from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m.); or
every other week (the second and fourth Sunday of every month, from 1 p.m. to
6 p.m.); or once a month (the first Saturday of every month, from 10 a.m. to 4
p.m.); or whatever other consistent schedule works for you and the group. The
where can be the DM’s house, or you can rotate playing locations among the
group, or you can meet in a conference room at work or school, or you can meet
wherever everyone can get to and be comfortable while playing the game.
The Dungeon Master’s Guide discusses some of the practical questions of
gathering a group, finding a place to play, coordinating food and beverages,
and structuring the game session. See sections “The Gaming Group” on pages
6–7, “Table Rules” on pages 14–15, “Getting Started” on page 19, and “Ending”
on page 29.
Sometimes the good social director DM must also play mediator when the
players themselves have a disagreement. Disagreements are inevitable. Just
strive to keep everyone civil and respectful of each other, and do your best to
help them reach an equitable solution. Sometimes this can be as simple as
having them roll dice if the disagreement involves dispute over an in-game
item, such as a piece of treasure or a newly discovered magic item.
Sometimes more work needs to be done, and it’s okay for you to ask them to
table the argument for now and get back to it after the game session ends so
that the rest of the group can continue the game. 
A good way to keep in contact and make sure everyone knows when and where
the next game session will be held is e-mail. Sending out reminders is a great
way for the DM to stay on top of the social director role. And if you handle the
e-mails with a little bit of flair and creativity, you can even treat them as an
extension of your game world. Perhaps the reminder for the next game session
is sent out by the villain that the group has been tracking for the last couple of
sessions, degrading them (in the villain’s voice, of course) for being unable to
catch him. That should get everyone to the gaming table on time!
The best DM as social director keeps in touch with the players between ses-
sions and keeps everyone talking to each other to work through disagreements.
DM as creator
You might be the type of Dungeon Master who uses only published adven-
tures and campaign setting books. Or you might be the type of DM who looks
19
Chapter 1: The Role of the Dungeon Master

to purchased items for inspiration but tends to create adventures from
scratch. Either way, you have a role as a creator when you’re the DM.
Every decision, every rules call, every utterance by a monster or a villain,
every descriptive flair you add to your narration of a scene — all of these
things and more reveal the creator inside you. The DM creates whole worlds
one encounter at a time. That’s a big part of the fun of being the DM: You get
to lay the foundation for the story, the adventure, and the world that will
unfold with every game session you play. Sure, the players add to the story
and the world through the actions of their characters, but it all begins with
the DM.
Even if you decide to use published adventures, you still get to express your
creativity by making subtle changes to better fit what has happened earlier in
your campaign or to react to something unexpected that the player charac-
ters do. We dive into this expression of Dungeon Mastering in more detail
later in the book, especially in Parts III and IV.
The best DM as creator rewards the players who make the effort to immerse
themselves in the game world by providing an experience that’s every bit as
engaging as a well-written book or great movie.
The Goal of Dungeon Mastering
The earlier sections in this chapter cover, in broad strokes, the many hats
worn by the Dungeon Master. But what’s the goal of being the DM? Why do
you do it? A number of goals exist, but it boils down to this: to have fun. The
DM gets to have fun by running the game, crafting the adventures, and narrat-
ing the story of the player characters. When the DM and the players both
have a fun and satisfying experience, the game of D&D really shines as a
social experience.
Whether you like moderating the rules, narrating the story, or creating the
adventure — or taking on any of the other expressions of DMing we discuss
in this chapter — the reason to be the DM, the only reason, is because you
enjoy it. When you have fun, the whole group has fun, and that’s what games
such as D&D are all about.

 Making preparations before a game session
 Understanding game etiquette
B
efore swords are drawn and deadly spells are whispered in the dark,
someone has to arrange a game session. Usually, that someone is the
Dungeon Master. You need to find some players, pick a time and place to play,
and figure out what sort of adventure you can throw at them. Without play-
ers, the adventure you create or pick out doesn’t get played. Without an
adventure, you have nothing for the players to do. When a great group of
players comes together for a great adventure, that’s when the D&D game is at
its best! This chapter explores those two essential ingredients. 
Gathering a Game Group
The DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game requires a group of people to play. The group
can be as small as two (a Dungeon Master and a single player) or as large as
eight or more. The best size depends on what you’re comfortable running,
but we’ve found that groups of five to seven people work out best (one DM
and four to six players). You want enough people to make up a good group of
adventurers, but not so many that players have to wait a long time for their
turns to come around again. 
Here’s an interesting fact: All of the current D&D products are written with
the assumption that your game group contains five player characters. That’s
how the writers and game developers of D&D products balance the encoun-
ters and determine the level of difficultly of a challenge — what would be
challenging for a party of five characters of a specific level? If your group has
fewer than five player characters, you might want to tone down encounters

that you find in published material. On the other hand, if your group has
more than five player characters, you might want to increase the number of
opponents or otherwise compensate to increase the challenge for the party.
(Part II of this book provides tips and advice on how to do this and other
advanced DMing techniques.)
You want to recruit players from among those people who like to play games,
have an interest in fantasy, and enjoy stories about action and adventure.
People who love fantasy films such as The Lord of the Rings movies, enjoy
reading books by authors such as Terry Brooks or George R. R. Martin, or
engage in computer games such as Neverwinter Nights or World of Warcraft all
possess at least the potential to enjoy the D&D game.
Finding players
Some people are lucky enough to have a group of friends ready and willing to
play the D&D game. Everyone else has to go out and find players to partici-
pate in an adventure. You can accomplish this in a number of ways; we dis-
cuss a few of the ways you can find players for your D&D game in the
following subsections.
Friends and relatives
Existing friends and relatives make good sources to draw D&D players from.
Of course, you want to ask only the people you feel might have at least some
interest in this kind of activity. It doesn’t pay to try to turn someone who
hates games or who despises fantasy into a D&D player. Such attempts often
just result in a bad experience for everyone involved. 
School
Many high schools and colleges have game clubs of one kind or another.
These extracurricular activities provide a good source of players and might
even provide you with access to existing D&D game groups. If you’re in
school, check to see whether your school has an active game club — and if
not, look into starting one!
Work
If school is behind you, your place of business might contain folks with an
interest in D&D who could join your regular game group. Or, depending on your
work environment, you might even be able to play D&D at your workplace
during lunch or after work hours. You can use lunchtime or after-hours games
to kick off a workplace campaign. If you’re lucky enough to have a workplace
with conference rooms and interested players, you have almost everything
you need right there to get a gaming group started. (We use conference
22
Part I: Running a Great Game 

rooms at the Wizards of the Coast building to run D&D games at lunch and in
the evenings for fun, and we often play as part of work at other times during
the day!)
D&D Insider
Another good source of helpful DM information (and D&D information in 
general, such as news about upcoming products) is the D&D Insider Web site
(www.dndinsider.com). A robust online community hangs out at the Web
site, engaging in message board discussions and debates, playing online D&D
games, and attending online seminars. You can find gaming stores in your
area, upcoming D&D events and conventions, and other information that can
help you build your gaming group. Using the D&D Game Table, you can also
gather old or new friends around a virtual table on the internet for a D&D
game! See Chapter 12 for more about using the Internet.
Game store
Your local game or hobby store might have space dedicated to in-store play
where you can meet players from your area. If not, most such businesses pro-
vide a message board where players can post “gaming wanted” ads and make
connections. Through your gaming store, you should be able to hook up with
players who are interested in getting into a D&D game.
Conventions
Conventions devoted to D&D and other roleplaying games take place all 
over the world throughout the year. Huge conventions such as GenCon
(www.gencon.com) and Origins (www.originsgames.com), as well as
smaller regional game conventions, provide weekends full of more gaming
than you can imagine. The local cons are better for finding gamers to play
with on a regular basis, but nothing beats the larger cons for nonstop D&D
action at a scale that could leave you breathless. In addition, many comic
book and fantasy conventions (such as the San Diego Comic-Con, www.
comic-con.org) run gaming tracks where you can get in some D&D in
between panels, special presentations, and wandering the exhibit halls.
RPGA
The ROLEPLAYING GAMERS ASSOCIATION (or RPGA) is devoted to making it easier 
to enjoy face-to-face DUNGEONS & DRAGONS experiences. Run by Wizards of the
Coast’s Organized Play department, the RPGA is a global gaming group that
runs sanctioned roleplaying events all over the world. Joining the RPGA is
easy, and your free membership lasts a lifetime. Because finding a gaming
group can be challenging and because creating new adventures can be time-
consuming, the RPGA provides free DM material and makes an event calendar
available to members so they can find games happening in their community.
Check out the RPGA online at www.wizards.com/rpga.

Chapter 2: Preparing for Play

Inviting players to the game
When you go about inviting potential players to play the game, you might not
want to initially start out looking for an ongoing commitment. You want to
make sure the people you invite to play enjoy the experience, and you want
to make sure that each person is a good fit for the group. Start out slowly,
with a single event. In some ways, think about this first session as you would
any gathering with friends. There isn’t a lot of difference between planning
for an evening of D&D and planning for an evening of playing poker or watch-
ing DVDs.
In fact, when you establish it, your weekly (or monthly, or whatever) D&D
game resembles a weekly poker game. You and your gaming buddies get
together at regular intervals, either in the same place or at alternating loca-
tions. You play at a table with game pieces (in the case of the D&D game, dice
24
Part I: Running a Great Game 

and miniatures and books instead of cards and chips). And the table usually
overflows with snacks and refreshing beverages of one sort or another.
Before you invite the players to the first game session, decide on the following:
 When should the players create characters? Decide whether you want
the players to create characters before they arrive or at the table. If the
players know what they’re doing, they can make characters on their own
and come to the first session ready to play. But if they’re still learning
the game, it’s a good idea to devote the first session to making charac-
ters so you can help them through the process and check what they’re
doing as they go. Also, creating characters at the game table allows the
players to discuss options and form a more compatible party of adven-
turers, covering each of the character roles. (“We need a leader! Who
wants to be the leader?”)
If you’re playing with people who are totally unfamiliar with the game,
you might want to use pregenerated characters for this initial game ses-
sion. You can find ready-to-use player characters in Dungeons & Dragons
4th Edition For Dummies (Wiley Publishing, Inc.), in the D&D Roleplaying
Game Starter Set, or in the adventure Keep on the Shadowfell. After you
and the group get a session or two of the game behind you, you can
start over and let everyone create exactly the characters they want to
play. After seeing the game in action, everyone will be able to make
better informed decisions concerning class, race, ability scores, and
powers for their characters.
 When and where are you playing? For the first session, you need to
pick a location to play and a time that’s convenient for you and the 
players.
 How long do you and the players feel comfortable playing the first
time? We find that two to four hours makes a good beginning session
length. 
 Who’s in charge of snacks and beverages? Do you want to suggest that
everyone bring snacks and drinks to share, or do you want to make it a
bring-your-own-snacks kind of event? Either way is fine, just so long as
you let everyone know what’s expected of them.
Make sure that you ask the players to let you know whether they plan on
attending the game. Inevitably, someone is going to get sick, become busy, or
otherwise be unable to attend, so you want to have prior warning. If you invite
six people into the game and only four can make it, you still have enough play-
ers for the game to go on. If the number falls too low, you want to have time
enough to reschedule or to let those players who are attending know that you
might have to change your plans for the evening. (Some rousing battles using
the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Miniatures Game, or a favorite board game, can fill the
space when you don’t have enough players for the adventure.)
25
Chapter 2: Preparing for Play

Using a Published Adventure
As the Dungeon Master, you have to determine what adventure you want to
run for your game session. If this is going to be your first adventure (for you
or your group or the players’ newest characters), we recommend starting
with something official. The Dungeon Master’s Guide, the D&D Roleplaying
Game Starter Set, Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition For Dummies, and this book
(see Chapter 19) all have ready-to-use adventures designed for 1st-level char-
acters. If you’re looking for an adventure for an established group of higher-
level characters, you can turn to a number of sources.
Wizards of the Coast products
As the publishers of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game, Wizards of the Coast
makes a number of adventures and publishes new adventures all the time.
Current in-print adventures include Keep on the Shadowfell (1st to 3rd level),
Thunderspire Labyrinth (4th to 6th level), and Pyramid of Shadows (7th to 
10th level). 
D&D adventures provide solid plots, exciting encounters, and great villains to
throw at the player characters. The great thing about published adventures,
whether they’re designed for generic D&D or one of D&D’s campaign worlds
(such as FORGOTTEN REALMS or EBERRON), is that they provide a good basis for
your work. You can run them exactly as they’re written, or you can make
subtle to sweeping changes to make the adventure uniquely your own. 
Here’s a secret that so few DMs seem to be aware of: You don’t have to be
running an EBERRON (or whatever) campaign to use an EBERRON (or whatever)
adventure. Take any published adventure that catches your eye, change
names and locations to suit your campaign, and you have a ready-to-play
adventure where most of the work of crafting encounters and creating mon-
ster stats has already been done for you.
Dungeon magazine
Wizards of the Coast also produces the official Dungeon magazine. This
monthly online periodical contains all kinds of tips and advice for DMs, and 
it also provides encounters, lairs, and three or four full-length adventures 
for characters of varying levels in every issue. It makes a great resource for
DMs looking for something to run on a moment’s notice or for exciting

encounters to drop into any campaign. Find out more about Dungeon maga-
zine at www.dndinsider.com.
RPGA
Members of the RPGA gain access to convention-style adventures for all
levels of play. Because they’re designed to be played through in a four- or
five-hour convention slot, these adventures are great for filling in those
evenings when you’re not quite prepared for your regular game with your
friends. You can also use these adventures to run sanctioned events. Check
out www.wizards.com/rpga for more information.
Other d20 publishers
Wizards of the Coast allows other companies to produce material for use
with D&D — including adventures — under a license called the Game System
License (GSL). Look for the d20 SYSTEM logo, shown in Figure 2-1, for products
that are compatible with D&D.
Creating Your Own Adventures
When you have some experience with being a Dungeon Master and feel ready,
you can create your own adventures for your campaign. Most DMs (ourselves
included) use a mix of published adventures and their own creations to gen-
erate their ongoing campaigns. We recommend that new DMs start out by
using published adventures to get a feel for how adventures come together,
and then start altering published adventures to suit the purposes of their
campaigns. After you’ve had some experience, go ahead and make your own.
Part III of this book is devoted to helping you in this endeavor.
Even when you get to the point where you’re creating your own adventures
on a regular basis, you can still utilize published adventures in your cam-
paign. Running a published adventure every so often gives you a break from
Figure 2-1:

Chapter 2: Preparing for Play

adventure creation. Plus, we’re confident that you’ll find something in every
published adventure that you can lift out and use in your adventures. Use
every available resource to your best advantage, we always say.
Making Preparations before the Game
Before the big night (or afternoon, or whatever) of your game session, in
addition to informing the players about the particulars of character creation,
time, location, and snack expectations (as we describe earlier in this chap-
ter), you have a few more things to do to get ready. As Dungeon Master, you
need to have a working knowledge of the rules of the game. More often than
not, the players will turn to you to explain how a particular portion of the
game works or to ask how to accomplish something in the game. You need to
be ready. This doesn’t mean that you need to memorize the Player’s Handbook
and Dungeon Master’s Guide from cover to cover. But you do need to know
and understand the basics of play — combat, task resolution, movement. For
everything else, you just need to have a sense of where to go in the rulebooks
to look something up. 
If you’re using the D&D Roleplaying Game Starter Set as the foundation of
your first game session, you have less material to know and deal with. If
you’re diving right in with the full version of the game, you have a bit more
material to peruse before game night. There are no tests; this isn’t school.
D&D is a game and it’s fun, so don’t sweat the details. Just be ready for the
big picture, and you’ll do fine.
When in doubt about where to find a rule, use the rules you do know and
make something up. The goal is to keep the adventure moving, not to neces-
sarily make sure that a player character’s attempt to grapple the owlbear
goes exactly according to the rules. You can always research the rule in ques-
tion after the game. If it turns out that your ruling was way off and had an
adverse effect on the player characters, you can decide to make it up to the
players in some way at the next game session. Part II of this book deals with
these kinds of advanced DMing issues and techniques in greater detail.
The other thing you want to do before the game session is prepare your
adventure. If you’re using a published adventure, read through it and make
notes on things you want to change or add or on rules you might need to
refer to for particular encounters. If you’re using an adventure of your own
creation, make sure you finish creating it — or at least as much of it as you
plan to run at the session — before the time of the event. You can’t play D&D
without an adventure, and the DM must be prepared.

ready to run a published adventure.
Establishing the Ground Rules: 
Gaming Etiquette
As in any social experience, a D&D game benefits from common courtesies
and ground rules that are followed by players and DMs alike. These rules of
conduct aren’t revolutionary, but it’s good to review them with your gaming
group so that everyone knows what’s expected of them when they come to
play D&D: 
 It’s the DM’s show. Players need to be kind to the DM and accept the
DM’s authority over the game. Likewise, when the DM makes a mistake
(and it will happen), he or she should be willing to change a decision if
that decision had negative repercussions for a player character.
 Play fair. Players shouldn’t cheat, even to save their characters’ lives.
There are ways to deal with bad rolls (even ones that will result in a
character’s death) that don’t force a player to stoop so low as to cheat.
 Accentuate the positive. Players should compliment the DM on a good
game. Likewise, DMs should praise players when they have their charac-
ters do something especially clever or heroic or just plain fun.
 Let the players play. The DM needs to be kind to the players, treating
them fairly and letting them make their own decisions. The DM shouldn’t
force the player characters to follow a specific path through the adven-
ture, shouldn’t punish them for being clever, and shouldn’t intentionally
and maliciously try to kill them.
 It’s the players’ game, too. The DM needs to treat players with respect
and should ask them for their opinions on difficult rules interpretations.
 Eliminate the negative. The DM and the players should leave the real
world behind when they play D&D, including any disagreements or lin-
gering bad feelings that might otherwise color the way they play for a
particular session. The DM and players should avoid distractions that
make it hard for everyone to enjoy the game.
 And most importantly, have fun!

Running the Game
In This Chapter
 Understanding the DM’s role
 Exploring the parts of a game session
 Discovering ways to end a game session
 Examining out-of-session activities
You’ve gathered a group of players. You’ve invited them to a game. You’ve
made all your preparations, planning a number of interesting encounters
and even a few surprises. Now comes the moment of truth. Now comes the
game session.
There really aren’t any hidden secrets to making the game session come off
well so that everyone has fun. That said, if you know going in what a typical
game session might look like, you’ll have an easier time of it. In this chapter,
we explore the game session by breaking it down into its component parts.
Then we provide tips and advice on how you can make the most out of each
of those parts.
This chapter covers the basics of running a game session. In Part II of this
book, we expand upon many of the topics we discuss in this chapter.
Taking Charge as Dungeon Master 
and Running the Game
As we point out time and again in this book, the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game
features a unique element that makes it different from all other games — the
role of the Dungeon Master. The DM is a movie director, storyteller, and com-
puter processor all in one. The DM tells the players what their characters see
and hear, determines the outcomes of their actions (with the help of the rules

and the dice), and keeps the adventure moving. Because of the presence of
the DM, players can have their characters try anything, go anywhere, or risk
everything. The only limits are the imagination of the gaming group and the
dice rolls the players make.
During a game session, the DM narrates the adventure, runs all the charac-
ters and monsters not controlled by the other players, and determines the
course of the story by evaluating the actions of the player characters and the
results of the dice rolls.
DM laws
The DM is the final authority when it comes to a rules question or dispute. In
the following list, we give some pointers for being a good arbiter in your role
as the DM:
 Make it up when you’re in doubt! It’s better to keep the game moving
and the story progressing than to get bogged down looking up rules or
arguing about a result.
 Say yes! It’s better to make a generous interpretation that rewards the
players for doing something creative and interesting than to look for a
reason why something fun won’t work.
32
Part I: Running a Great Game 

 Use ability checks to determine success if the players try to do some-
thing that isn’t otherwise covered by any other rules.
 Remember that you as the DM aren’t competing against the players.
Instead, you’re like a referee who helps advance the story and chal-
lenges the players.
 Don’t think of the adventure as your story. Don’t think of the adventure
as the players’ story. It’s the group’s story. Let everyone participate in
advancing the story.
 Be fair above all else. If you determine that a rule should work in a spe-
cific way, make sure it works that way in the future. Don’t play favorites.
Be consistent.
If you do these things, everyone will have a good time.
DM basics
The DM runs the game, so even if you’re using a published adventure and not
creating your own, you need to read the adventure before the game session
and think about possible outcomes and twists and turns. Then you can bring
the adventure to life as the players make their contributions to the tale through
the actions of their characters. Why read a published adventure beforehand?
Because the game session will go more smoothly if you as the DM have a feel
for the pace of the story and know how to adjust the plot based on the actions
of the player characters. 
After setting the scene for any particular encounter, pose a question to the
players, such as “What is your character going to do?” Asking a question gets
the players thinking and makes them imagine the scene so they can decide
what to do. The answer to the question leads to all kinds of action, excite-
ment, and surprises for everyone involved. Use your own imagination, the
game rules, and the results of the dice to determine what happens as the
action unfolds.
Narrating
When you narrate an adventure, you bring the imaginary adventure to life.
Narration takes a number of forms. First, you present a scene to the players,
which usually ends with the question, “What is your character going to do?”
If you use a published adventure, the narration is often provided to you in the
form of read aloud text (portions of the adventure meant to be read aloud or
paraphrased for the players). If you’re using your own adventure or if the
players ask a question that isn’t covered by the read aloud text, you get to
make something up. Be careful, though. Don’t reveal more details than the
characters would be able to acquire with a casual glance. If the players want
33
Chapter 3: Running the Game

their characters to spend more time studying or examining something, let
them know that time passes. You might even want to call for a Perception
check or other appropriate skill use check.
The second form of narration occurs after a player answers your question about
what his or her character is going to do and you call for the appropriate die roll.
You interpret the results and feed it back to the players in as engaging and imag-
inative a method as you can muster. Don’t just say, “Okay, you got an attack
result of 18. That’s a hit. Roll damage.” Liven it up with more descriptive words
and phrases. For example, “Your mighty swing hits the orc squarely in the chest.
The orc appears to be staggered by the blow, but it doesn’t fall down!”
Running NPCs and monsters
When the player characters meet nonplayer characters, monsters, and vil-
lains in the course of an adventure, the DM gets to run them. Play these non-
player characters according to their Intelligence and Wisdom scores, any
notes you have concerning their goals and motivations, and in response to
the actions of the player characters (PCs). Even a friendly character or crea-
ture can be driven to violence if treated poorly by the PCs. Remember to play
the monsters fairly and to keep your knowledge as DM separate from what
the monsters can be expected to know according to the story and what has
happened previously in the adventure.
Winging it
At some point, the players are going to step off the anticipated path of the
adventure or try to do something strange and unexpected. That’s okay. In
fact, it’s encouraged! That’s what makes the D&D game a unique and won-
drous experience. More to the point, the DM is there for just such an occa-
sion. When a situation comes up that you haven’t planned for, make
something up! When the player characters leave the map, wing it! Be fair, be
consistent, have fun, and everything will work out. See the section on keeping
the game moving in Chapter 10 for more on this important DM technique. 
Playing through the Game Session
The game session provides the means for you to play the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
game. It’s the time that you and the other players have set aside for the
express purpose of playing D&D, of exploring imaginary dungeons and battling
mythical monsters of all descriptions. In the following sections, we examine
the game session from two perspectives: the first game session and a typical
game session in an ongoing campaign.
34
Part I: Running a Great Game 

Setting ground rules
After you’ve formed a game group and picked an evening or weekend afternoon
or other convenient time when everybody can spend a few hours playing
D&D, set up the ground rules as outlined in Chapter 2. Make sure everyone
knows and agrees to the ground rules and understands the basics of how the
game is played. (We discuss how you can best teach D&D in Chapter 6.)
Remember your time limit; you’re going to want to wrap up about 15 minutes
early so that you and the players can deal with after-game notes, cleanup,
and other post-game activities.
If a meal (or two) makes up part of your game session, make sure that every-
one knows when you plan to break for eating and what contribution everyone
is expected to make to the meal. 
Settling in as everyone arrives
When the players arrive, give everyone a chance to get settled and socialize.
This is a time-honored ritual for the beginning of D&D games everywhere, and
you shouldn’t try to fight it. D&D is as much a social event as it is a game, so let
the players talk and joke and catch up before the game swings into high gear.
If this is your first game, have the host show everyone where to put coats
and jackets, as well as point out where the bathroom and other necessities
can be found. If the host has any ground rules concerning his or her home,
make sure that the players know them and follow them. Remember that cour-
tesy to the host means you’ll be invited back to play there again. If the host
asks players to remove their shoes before walking across the carpet, to use
coasters to keep refreshing beverages from leaving a ring on the table, or
whatever, the players should abide by these requests. Don’t forget the intro-
ductions if some of the players don’t know each other!
If this is an ongoing game, everyone knows the rules and all of the accessible
and important locations associated with the play area. They each have a
favorite place to store their outer garments, and they know where to find the
glasses and bowls and silverware. The thing to watch with an existing group
(and this really isn’t too much of a problem) is that the initial socializing can
go on and on. Allow this settling-in period to continue for a little while, but
eventually you’ll want to ask everyone to wrap up their conversations and
move to the gaming table so you can get started.
Gathering around the game table
The game table is the term we use for where you play a game of D&D. In real-
ity, it might be a table surrounded by comfortable chairs, such as found in a
35
Chapter 3: Running the Game

kitchen or dining room. Or it might be a coffee table surrounded by couches
and chairs, such as found in a living or family room. As long as you have
places to sit, flat surfaces where you can roll dice and spread out battle grids
and miniatures, and space to put snacks and drinks and books, you have a
D&D game table.
The play area should be situated in such a way that the DM can spread out
his or her material while still being seen and heard by all the players. The DM
needs room for a DM screen, notes, game books, miniatures, and whatever
other accouterments he or she needs for the game session. Much of this
material needs to remain hidden from the players to maintain the mystery
and surprises associated with the adventure.
As game groups play from session to session, you’ll see some interesting
habits begin to develop. Players will inevitably take the same seats from ses-
sion to session. Indeed, sometimes a player will complain to no end if another
player takes his or her seat. Watch for these habits. Be amused by them. Let
them develop. They give your game group personality and color that you’ll
remember for years.
When everyone has found a place and gotten ready, you can begin the game.
Updating characters
Existing campaigns eventually reach the point when the player characters
have earned enough experience points (XP) to advance to the next level. You
need to decide whether you want to allow the players to update their charac-
ters on their own time or whether you want to set aside a portion of the game
session for this activity. Just as with character creation (see Chapter 2), if
you have them level up at the table, you can participate in the process,
answer questions, and make sure they’re following the rules correctly.
If you decide to make character updating part of the game session, it proba-
bly should happen at the beginning of the session. If you have the players do
the updating away from the table, use a portion of the beginning of a session
to review what the players did to their characters. As DM, you aren’t just
checking to see whether the characters are legal; you need to know what
direction the players have taken their characters and what abilities are in the
group so you can better plan future adventures. Take a look at new powers
the characters have learned and new feats they’ve acquired. It’s a good idea
to pay particular attention when characters cross the threshold into new
tiers of play — make sure you know what paragon paths or epic destinies
they adopt because those decisions can say a lot about the player’s goals for
the character.
36
Part I: Running a Great Game 

37
Chapter 3: Running the Game

Opening with the prologue
You’ve had the out-of-game-socializing portion of the game session. You’ve
had the character creation/review/update portion of the game session. Now
it’s time to get to the adventure!
If this is your first game session with this group (or with this group of charac-
ters), start out with what we like to call the prologue. Like the prologue of a
novel or the part of a TV show or movie before the main title and credits roll,
the prologue for a D&D game sets up what is to come. Use it to set the scene
of your campaign world or at least to establish where the player characters
are as the adventure opens. Don’t make your opening too elaborate or too
long. You want to get to the action as soon as you can, not have the players
sit around and listen to you wax poetic about your world’s dozen moons or
the ruling members of the kingdom or whatever. Just provide enough infor-
mation to set the scene and get things off and running. You can work in other
details naturally as the adventure unfolds.
Another good thing to do at the beginning of your first game session is to let
the players introduce their characters. Let them briefly state their charac-
ters’ names and classes, describe what they look like, and mention what
others might notice upon seeing them for the first time.
Don’t worry about this for the first time you play, but when you start a new
adventure or campaign in the future, you might want to get information (such
as character background, old enemies, most feared monsters, or long-term
character goals) about the player characters beforehand so that you can
work that information into the plot or background you want to establish for
the campaign. Nothing roots the players and their characters in your world
more than having a place for their characters to immediately fit into. If the
player characters have a bit of history in the world, the world feels a bit more
real. See Chapter 11 for explicit ideas in this area.
We have one last consideration for you before the adventure gets going. Do
the player characters have a history with each other? Do they know each
other? Or are they meeting for the first time when the adventure begins?
There’s no correct way to do this, but you should be aware of what each
direction might mean to the game:
 If the player characters start the adventure already knowing each other,
you can establish that they have a rapport and a desire to help each other
right from the beginning. This can be a little artificial, but without this
connection, you can run into some bad player character interaction 
for no reason. Possible starting connections include that the player
38
Part I: Running a Great Game 

characters grew up together in the same village or town, that they have
been working together for a short time prior to the start of the adven-
ture, that they all serve the same master or patron who has provided
their training to date, or that they all got together to face a menace in
the past and continue to work together as they seek to find it and
destroy it. These are just examples. You can and should include the play-
ers in a discussion to set up party connections if this is something you
want to establish right off the bat.
 If the player characters meet for the first time at the start of the
adventure, you run the risk of one player character’s goals going against
the goals of another player character or the entire party. This can still
work out, and it’s often fun to see the players develop connections natu-
rally as the adventure plays out, but it can be risky. At the very least,
you should have the players come up with compatible goals and choose
compatible alignments so that party cohesion doesn’t suffer. (See the
sidebar in this chapter, “Player character alignment.”)
Recapping the previous session
If you’re running an ongoing campaign, then at the beginning of most game
sessions, the prologue is replaced by the recap. (At the start of a new adven-
ture or at other key story moments in a campaign, it might be appropriate to
have another prologue moment.) The recap helps get players back into the
story and gets them thinking about what happened last time and what they
might be expecting (or dreading!) in the upcoming session.
39
Chapter 3: Running the Game
Player character alignment
The D&D game allows for players to choose any
alignment for their characters. Alignment is a
tool for developing a character, not a carved-in-
stone proclamation about how a character must
behave. It’s a guideline, not a decree.
That said, we’ve found that, at the very least,
characters in a party need to have compatible
alignments. Nothing can destroy a campaign
faster than good-aligned characters and evil-
aligned characters in the same party deciding
to work against each other. Frankly, we’ve found
that evil alignments are better left to the mon-
sters and villains; player character parties work
out better when the characters take on good
alignments or stay unaligned. Motivations for
adventures come together easier, character
interaction goes more smoothly, and the heroic
aspects of D&D shine through in ways that just
don’t happen when players play evil characters.

Now, you as the DM might give the recap of the previous session, but where’s
the fun or advantage in that? You know what happened, and you also know
the behind-the-scenes stuff that you don’t want to inadvertently give away if
you tell everyone what happened last time. Better to have the players give
the recap. This accomplishes three main things for you:
 It lets you see what the players remember and think they’ve figured out
about the events and situations that they’ve previously encountered. 
 It lets you get a feel for the story from the players’ points of view (which
are always going to be at least slightly different from your own). 
 It allows the players to make conclusions and throw out ideas that you
can use to best advantage later in the adventure.
Start a game session by asking the players for a recap of the previous session.
When we’re acting as DMs, we each have different methods. For instance, Bill
starts his game sessions by asking his players “What happened last time?” or
“Where were we?” (Of course, his players often respond “You were about to
give us experience points!” What started long ago as a way to see whether
their DM was paying attention has since become a running gag around the
game table.) Let each player add something to the telling. You get to see what
they remember, what they think is important, and sometimes what they think
is going on behind the scenes. You know what? Sometimes what they come
up with is better than what you have planned. Here’s a secret: They’ll never
know whether you decide to take one of their ideas and use it in place of
yours. You wind up looking good, and they feel clever — everybody wins!
Taking on encounters
The heart of every adventure, the unit in which adventures and game ses-
sions are built, is the encounter. Most encounters in a game of D&D include a
battle with one or more monsters. Encounters in a typical game session fall
into two broad categories:
 The combat encounter: Combat encounters are structured in rounds,
where most of the rules of the game come into play. Most of the encoun-
ters in your adventure are, or will evolve into, combat encounters. 
 The noncombat encounter: An encounter that doesn’t involve combat
is, naturally, a noncombat encounter. This might be a skill challenge,
which requires multiple skill checks as the player characters attempt to
defeat a natural hazard, a deadly trap, or a tense negotiation. It could be
a puzzle, which tests the players’ minds as well as (or instead of) the
characters’ abilities. 
During a game session, you might run a single dramatic encounter with a
complex battle scene and waves of multiple monsters, or you might have time
for a number of short encounters. It all depends on not only the encounter
40
Part I: Running a Great Game 

you’ve developed but the actions of the player characters. Even an encounter
you thought would take the whole session can be cut short by clever play,
the use of a powerful spell, unexpected diplomacy, or simply by the player
characters turning south in the dungeon instead of going north. Let this kind
of thing play out naturally. Never force a battle or a specific kind of encounter.
The fun of the game is seeing what the players do with the situations you set
up — let them play out with the player characters’ actions.
You don’t have to lose that exciting encounter you were planning with the
blackfire dracolich just because the player characters didn’t open the right
door in the dungeon. Save it for another time or move it to another place in
the dungeon as you see fit.
When you run noncombat encounters, you don’t necessarily have to keep
track of whose turn it is or exactly where every character is standing on the
battle grid. Just make sure that all the players get a chance to participate and
don’t let any single player (including yourself!) hog the spotlight. Certainly,
however, combat encounters work best when run in strict initiative order and
with the use of a battle grid and miniatures.
For combat encounters, think about what elements will make visually inter-
esting and dynamic battles. (We cover this in more detail in Chapter 13.)
Consider not only the monsters or other opponents to throw at the party, but
think about the terrain in which the fight will occur. Fighting in a plain dun-
geon room of stone is fine, but battling it out in a cavern filled with a lake of
molten fire is really exciting and turns the terrain into a participant in the
battle.
Handling combat
Combat encounters are where the D&D game really comes alive, and they can
also be where your head starts to explode. Tracking initiative, handling the
various effects of powers on both the player characters and their opponents,
moving creatures around on the battle grid, keeping track of monster hit
points, remembering which monster on the grid is which — there’s a lot
going on in combat, and a lot of it is the DM’s job. 
There are plenty of tricks you can use to keep things under control, but the
most important is to delegate. If you’re playing D&D, you have a table full of
reasonably smart people you can call on to help you manage the information
load of even the most complicated combat encounter. For example, you
might have one player act as the initiative tracker in combat. It’s that
person’s job to tell the other players (including you) when it’s their charac-
ters’ turn to act. Or you might tell the players that it’s their job to remember
both conditions they put on monsters (“Hey, remember I gave that orc a –2
penalty on this attack.”) and conditions the monsters put on them (“. . . and 
I roll a saving throw against being slowed.”). Use your players’ collective
41
Chapter 3: Running the Game

knowledge of the rules, too — though you might need to remind them to cor-
rect you and the other players gently, when it’s necessary (“Oh, remember
that you can’t shift past the corner of the wall like that.”).
Most DMs (or designated players) use one of two methods to keep track of
initiative: cards or a list. The Dungeon Master’s Guide discusses tracking ini-
tiative on pages 38–39. It covers some of the pros and cons of using cards or
lists and whether a list is visible to the players or hidden behind the DM
screen. In addition, it gives advice on how to handle sudden changes to the
initiative order, such as when a character decides to hold his or her actions
until later in the round. Page 220 in the DMG is a set of combat cards you can
photocopy to track initiative and other information in your game.
Tracking monster hit points and conditions
Keeping track of monster hit points (hp), penalties, and conditions that come
and go as combat progresses is pretty straightforward, but the more mon-
sters and characters are involved in the encounter, the more complex it can
become. Choose a way to track these conditions that works best with the
way you track initiative:
 Combat cards: If you’re using cards (like the combat cards in the back of
the Dungeon Master’s Guide) to track initiative, keep track of monster hit
points right on the card. When a monster is affected by a penalty or con-
dition (such as being dazed or slowed), note the condition on the card
as well.
We find it useful to write the condition down, note when it ends (either
at the end of someone’s turn or with a save), and put a little box or circle
beside it. Then, when the condition ends, put a check in the box rather
than crossing out the name of the condition. In many encounters, mon-
sters and (especially) characters suffer from the same condition multi-
ple times. When this happens, you can just put another check box after
the condition name instead of writing it out again. 
 Initiative list: Keep track of monster hp and conditions right next to
their names on the initiative list. 
 Statistics blocks: If you’re running monsters from a published adventure
or from a printed copy of their statistics, you can write on the page right
next to the relevant statistics. Record a monster’s hit points near the hit
point entry on its statistics — and you’ll find it easy to see when the
monster is bloodied and whether something happens when it gets blood-
ied. If it has a penalty to its defenses, note that near its defenses line. If it
gets an attack penalty (or bonus), note it near its attacks. If it’s dazed,
put that near its speed (because that most likely means it’s not going to
move on its turn). 
If you don’t want to write in your book, you can use sticky notes 
stuck on the Monster Manual page or in your adventure to track this
information.
42
Part I: Running a Great Game 

 Condition cards: You can also use cards to indicate conditions and
penalties, perhaps even with the definitions of the conditions copies onto
the cards. Players can put these cards on top of their character sheets or
on the top of their own power cards to remind them of conditions affect-
ing their characters. As DM, you can put them on top of monster statis-
tics or clip them to the combat cards you use to track initiative.
Telling the monsters apart
In an encounter with three orc brutes and two orc archers, it can be tricky to
keep track of which orc is bloodied, which one is dazed, and which one has a
–2 penalty to its next attack roll. There are two basic methods you can use to
help you keep track of which monster is which.
 Distinguish the miniatures: If you have three different miniatures that
can all represent orc brutes, you can use them. Otherwise, you can use
little stickers on the miniatures’ bases, some other kind of marker on or
under the miniature, or even hand-painted details to distinguish three
otherwise identical orcs from each other. Then, wherever you track
information about the monsters, you can identify the orcs by those
details. Your combat card for the orc brutes might show, for example,
that the orc with the greataxe (a different miniature than the others), the
orc with the little skull sticker on its base, the orc with the blue mag-
netic disk beneath its base, or the orc with a blood-red shield is the one
that’s bloodied and dazed.
 Use position: Often, it’s enough to remember that one orc archer started
out more to your right and the other one more to your left. Even as they
move around in battle, their relative positions can stay fairly constant.
You might also note that one orc archer is the one Travok is attacking,
while the other is the one that’s been shooting at Baredd. You can track
their hit points on a combat card or your initiative list using the same
relative position (hit points for the orc on the left go on the left), or with
a word or two noting which orc goes with which hit point total (write
“Travok” by the one Travok has been beating on). 
Using markers on the table 
A marker placed on the battle grid can be useful for more than just differenti-
ating one orc brute from another. Some groups find them useful for indicating
which monster is the ranger’s quarry, which monster is under the warlock’s
curse, and which ones are marked by the fighter or the paladin. A marker
might also show the location of the wizard’s cloud of daggers or the cleric’s
spiritual weapon. Alternatively, you can use different-colored markers to show
conditions affecting creatures on the battle grid — a black disk might mean
the creature is stunned, whereas a purple one means it’s slowed.
What makes a good marker? You can buy colored magnetic disks that fit
underneath a Medium miniature’s base. Smaller cardboard tokens work well,
too. Glass beads, small tokens from a board game, coins, or even candies can
43
Chapter 3: Running the Game

do the job. It’s best if you can use different color markers to mean different
things — and be consistent about what each color means, so you and your
players will develop a shared vocabulary. 
Ending a game session
Time management comes into play during a D&D game session. Remember
that you and the group agreed to a specific end time for the session, and you
want to wrap up play about 15 minutes prior to that so you can cover record-
keeping and other post-game activities (see the following section). Make sure
that you don’t let the PCs start a long battle just before you’re ready to wrap
up the session.
How do you end a game session? If the adventure reaches a natural conclusion,
you’re set. But many adventures require multiple sessions to play through. In
this case, you might consider the cliffhanger approach. Let the player charac-
ters get to the start of the next encounter. Let them see what’s waiting for
them. Then leave them hanging and wanting more by saying, “To be continued
next game session!” This leaves everyone ready and eager to get back to the
game at the next available opportunity. Just be careful not to actually start the
encounter. It’s tough to keep track of a combat or challenge encounter in the
middle of the action. Better to start the battle fresh at the next game session.
Closing with an epilogue
Save about 15 minutes or so at the end of the game session to handle the epi-
logue. Here’s where you let the players have a brief post-game discussion,
where they can make a few preliminary plans within your hearing (to help
you plan for the next session better), and where you can provide information
for them to jot down in notes or on character sheets. 
Review the encounters for the session and calculate experience points for the
party. 
You can find the XP tables and the rules for awarding experience points on
page 120 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.
You might also want to set up some activities for the players to deal with
between sessions. Have them decide what they want to do next (if you haven’t
left them at an obvious next step in the adventure) and let you know before
the next session. If the break occurred at a place where this is possible, let
them go shopping for their characters, upgrade their characters, or look for a
new rules supplement to add to the game for the next session — all pending
your approval, of course.

Narrating the Adventure

 Checking out the story-related roles of the DM
 Bringing your adventure to life
A
t its best, the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game is more than just a series of
extended combat encounters. It’s the ultimate interactive story, where
players and Dungeon Master alike help determine what happens next. To
make sure that the story gets as much of your attention as moderating the
rules, we use this chapter to get you into the basics of the DM’s role as narra-
tor and a cast of thousands. With a better understanding of how to approach
those two related roles, a DM can improve the story-related aspects of the
D&D experience.
Understanding D&D as a 
Storytelling Experience
Without even trying, the D&D game tells a story. That story revolves around
the player characters, and it grows with every action the player characters
perform, every monster they defeat, and every challenge they overcome.
Imagine what happens if you do a little planning and preparation! With fore-
shadowing, plotting, memorable villains, and spectacular locales, the story
aspects of the game can shine through in exciting, tense, and fun ways.
The group story concept
The DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game provides a fun, interactive method for telling
group stories in a fantasy setting. What’s a group story? A group story is a

story told cooperatively by a group of people. A D&D group story uses the
setting and game mechanics to provide a framework for how events unfold. It
isn’t a story in the traditional sense; the scenes that make up the story come
together as the players play the game.
The DM contributes to the group story by providing the world in which the
game takes place, establishing the setup and background for every adven-
ture, and by playing the monsters, villains, and other nonplayer characters
that inhabit the world.
Speaking of the world, the DM can simply let the implied world of D&D shine
through or use an existing campaign world, such as FORGOTTEN REALMS or
EBERRON, or the DM can create his or her own campaign setting. (See Chapter
22 for advice and suggestions for creating your own campaign world.)
The players contribute to the story by creating the characters they’re going
to play. These are the heroes of the story, the protagonists that eventually
become the true movers and shakers of the campaign — if you play long
enough for them to reach the highest levels of the game. Remember that the
player characters provide the interface for interacting with the imaginary
world of D&D. But they can be so much more than that. As players imagine
the backgrounds and personalities of their characters, their quirks and man-
nerisms, their goals and desires, they use these tools to contribute to the
group story.
When the player characters encounter monsters or some other form of
danger, and when the dice hit the table, that’s when the actions of players
and DM alike contribute to and influence the ongoing group story. Because
everyone contributes to the story and because of the random element of
dice, no one knows what’s really going to happen next. And therein lies the
power and fun of the D&D game.
An ongoing epic
Other games have a set beginning, middle, and end. Each session of D&D that
you play, however, is just one tale in a continuing epic set in a medieval world
where magic and monsters fill the land. This epic stars the characters that
the players create, characters that improve and develop from one adventure
to the next. Furthermore, events have consequences. Treasure, equipment,
and magical items that the player characters find can be used in subsequent
adventures, and monsters and villains can escape to trouble them again in a
future game session. So your adventures operate just like the episodes of a
weekly television series or like individual novels in a trilogy or series.
46
Part I: Running a Great Game 

The DM’s role
So, to bring it all back to you, the Dungeon Master, here’s an overview of your
role in all this: 
1. You select the adventures to run for the players (either creating them
yourself or using published adventures).
2. You create the campaign in which these adventures take place (either
overtly, with lots of planning, or just by letting the world develop natu-
rally with each adventure you run).
3. You narrate the adventure by setting each scene and describing the
results of the player characters’ actions.
4. You portray the cast of thousands that inhabit the world, playing all the
characters that aren’t the player characters — the extras, the friends
and foes, the monsters. (It really never adds up to thousands, by the
way. That just sounds more impressive than “a cast of dozens.”)
Telling Interesting and Exciting Stories
Rule number one: Don’t get too attached to your story idea. Sure, the DM sets
up the particulars of a story, but the group determines how it plays out.
Really, your task as the DM is to set up the story idea (or premise), a back-
ground, a cast of monsters and any nonplayer characters you think you need,
and the opening event that kicks off the adventure. After that, you have to let
the player characters lead the way. If you try to push them in a direction they
don’t want to go, the story will feel forced, and the game might break down.
Let the player characters do what they want and go where they will, and the
story will come together naturally and in surprising ways.
You have plenty of tools to help you with this, not the least of which are the
encounters you’ve prepared. Encounters make up the scenes of the story, but
they usually aren’t constructed to happen in any particular order. Sure, in the
adventure presented in Chapter 7, we number the encounters and present
them in an order. How the player characters navigate the dungeon — which
doors they open or pass, which corridors they explore and in what order, and
so on — determines when and how the encounters are, well, encountered.
Here’s the big secret to running a great adventure and telling a fantastic group
story: The action and the drama take place in the encounters. As good as the
premise you create might be, as intricate as the plot you decide to weave
becomes, the story happens in the encounters. That’s where the players and
47
Chapter 4: Narrating the Adventure

DM come together to perform actions, make decisions, and ultimately
advance the story with good roleplaying, good tactics, and a lot of dice
rolling. So, as the DM, you have to let the encounters and what happens in
them override whatever plot you imagined for the story. Again, it isn’t your
story. It’s the group’s story. And the group needs the freedom to tell it. 
Does this mean that your perfectly crafted plot (whether you made it up
yourself or purchased an adventure) is subject to the whims of the player
characters? For the most part, yes. You can use advanced techniques to steer
the plot or get the story back on track if it strays too far (as we describe in
Chapter 10), but for now just go with the flow and see where the group’s
imagination takes the story. 
Making a story a D&D story
D&D adventures are all set in a world that’s roughly equivalent to medieval
Europe. The rules of D&D become the physics of the world — magic works,
monsters are real, and heroic adventurers journey across the land. Every 
typical D&D setting follows certain conventions.
The Dungeon Master’s Guide gives an overview of these fundamental conven-
tions on page 150 and talks about what happens if you alter them on page
151. There are three conventions you shouldn’t mess with, though:
 D&D worlds are medieval. Medieval in this context means that no
modern technology is available in the world. Characters wear armor and
wield melee weapons such as longswords and battle axes. Gunpowder
doesn’t exist. The world has progressed to something akin to the
medieval Europe, but the knob has been turned up as far as the fantasy
is concerned. Castles and temples dot the landscape. People walk or
ride horses (or more exotic mounts). Farms are plentiful in the settled
lands, but vast reaches of unexplored wilderness spread out around
these pockets of civilization, and when the maps say “Here be dragons,”
you should really heed those words. Note that this isn’t historical
medieval, but instead it’s the medieval world of fairy tales, novels, and
fantasy movies. It’s all Camelot and knights and Robin Hood.
 D&D worlds are permeated with magic. From magic-using classes
(such as wizards, warlocks, and clerics) to magic items of all descrip-
tions, the wonders of spells and arcane knowledge make for exciting and
mysterious trappings for stories and encounters. Because of the pres-
ence of magic, the medieval setting becomes wondrous and frightening.
With magic, heroes can accomplish miracles, villains can launch plots to
take over or destroy the world, and a sense of wonder (both dark and
light) fills the land.
48
Part I: Running a Great Game 

 D&D worlds are filled with monsters. The monsters come in all shapes
and sizes. Some are relentlessly evil, others overtly friendly, and many
can show up to help or hinder adventurers as their own whims and the
needs of the story dictate. In many ways, monsters are the ultimate man-
ifestation of magic in the land because most D&D creatures depend on
magic to exist, if not to survive. Undead monsters, misshapen creatures,
giants, and constructs of all descriptions — the monsters of D&D fill vol-
umes and provide you with a huge toolbox of opponents to challenge
the player characters.
Some DMs break these conventions when they create their own campaign
worlds, but we don’t recommend that until you have some experience and
rules knowledge under your belt. Indeed, some believe that if you change
these fundamental concepts too much, you’re no longer playing the D&D game.
We say that as long as you start with these concepts and use the game system,
feel free to take your game in the direction that best suits you and the players
and leads to a fun and rewarding experience for everyone involved.
Choosing an adventure premise
As a new DM, you should start with simple adventure premises. You can
always go for bigger and more complex story ideas later, when both you and
the other players have a better feel for the game. Adventure premises can
come from anywhere, just as long as you couch the premise in the conven-
tions of D&D. Pull a plot from a movie or novel and think about how it would
work in a D&D world. You can draw inspiration from all kinds of sources. The
following list describes some simple adventure premises:
 Capture: The adventurers take a job to capture the leader of a marauding
band of goblins that have been raiding the village and the surrounding
area.
 Discover: The adventurers seek to discover the hidden tomb of the
Knight of the Flaming Sword.
 Escape: The adventurers have been captured by the evil priest of
Asmodeus and must find a way to escape the dungeon beneath the vile
temple.
 Protect: The adventurers have been hired to protect the baron’s envoy
and get her safely to the meeting in Wellford, a village that lies on the
other side of the Forsaken Forest.
 Rescue: The adventurers must rescue the dwarf prince from the troll
Nurgo before the monster feasts on its captive’s royal flesh.
 Search: The adventurers come across an ancient dungeon just waiting
to be explored.

Chapter 4: Narrating the Adventure

Mastering the Adventure Narration
You could make the comparison that a D&D game creates a movie that the
players watch in their collective imagination. It’s the most interactive and
immersive movie ever created (at least until your next game session), but it
kind of plays out as a movie nonetheless. Of course, you don’t film or record
this movie, and you can replay it only as a memory.
Still, just like a movie, your D&D game needs a few things. It needs stars —
the roles filled by the player characters. It needs a director, cool special
effects, and a cast of thousands — the roles filled by the DM. By manipulating
these roles, the DM narrates the adventure and brings together the elements
of the group story.
Directing the adventure
The Dungeon Master directs the action by establishing scenes and providing
a portion of the motivation that the player characters need to open the dun-
geon door, leap down the dark hole, or otherwise head to where the action is.
When you use a published adventure, this material is provided for you. You
get a ready-to-use scene with background and setup material, as well as some
hooks and motivations to get the player characters (PCs) to interact with the
scene. 
When you set the scene, make sure to play up the drama and tension of the
moment. Be descriptive. Show, don’t tell, the players what their characters
see and hear with strong adjectives and evocative language. Look to pub-
lished adventures, including “Kobold Hall” in Chapter 11 of the Dungeon
Master’s Guide and “The Necromancer’s Apprentice” in Chapter 19 of this
book, for examples of this in action.
Your enticements need to be subtle enough not to hit the PCs like a brick, but
overt enough for them to notice. For example, in your description of the
scene before them, you can slip in that they see a glint of gold among the
blanket of bones that cover the floor, or spot an ancient book lying open in a
corner, or notice an arcane glow from among the pile of weapons and armor,
or hear the muffled cry of a prisoner in distress. Not every scene or
encounter needs this kind of enticement, depending on the overall story and
motivation of the player characters, but once in a while it helps to move the
PCs in a particular direction.
When the player characters take the bait, the encounter takes place in all its
glory. Keep these do’s and don’ts in mind:
50
Part I: Running a Great Game 

 DM as Director Do’s:
• Do set the scene, describing what the PCs see, hear, and smell with
evocative language.
• Do exude drama and tension and excitement in your scene 
descriptions.
• Do entice the PCs to interact with the scene by subtly calling atten-
tion to features that reward closer inspection.
 DM as Director Don’ts:
• Don’t tell the players what their characters are doing; that’s up to
them to decide.
• Don’t give away all the secrets of the encounter in your descrip-
tion; allow the players to experience the fun of working some of it
out for themselves.
• Don’t overwhelm the players with too much detail. A description
can be evocative without being long.
Adding special effects
Good fantasy movies need good special effects, and your D&D game is no
exception. The world where the player characters adventure is imaginary,
but the game works best when you and the players suspend your disbelief
and act as though it’s real. The more real the characters and the world feel,
the better the roleplaying experience will be. That’s where the Dungeon
Master comes in.
By thinking in terms of a movie, the DM tries to make the imaginary action of
the D&D game as visual and as real as possible. The DM describes what the
player characters see and otherwise sense — make those descriptions as
vibrant and colorful as possible. Published adventures, such as the sample
adventure in Chapter 11 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide, help by providing the
basics of such descriptions for you, but you need to breathe life into those
descriptions by the way you present them.
When you describe a monster, imagine that creature as it would look in your
favorite fantasy/science-fiction movie. When you narrate the effects of an
arcane spell, imagine it as a cool special effect exploding across the screen.
Remember that you have an unlimited budget for your special effects because
most of the action takes place in your group’s imagination, so spare no expense
in the telling of the story.
51
Chapter 4: Narrating the Adventure

Use all five senses when you narrate. Don’t just tell the players what their
characters see; tell them what they hear, smell, taste, and feel, when appro-
priate. A depth of sensory descriptions promotes believability in the world
and a connection to the story.
Be consistent. No world, not even an imaginary one, should be arbitrary. If
you describe a door in the north wall of the chamber, it should be there later
when the player characters ask about it. And if it isn’t there from one
moment to the next, you need to have a good reason why not. A mysterious
door that fades in and out of existence is cool — as long as that’s what you
meant to do with it.
You need to get used to improvising. No adventure — not a published one,
not one you create from scratch — can account for every minute detail or
every possibility. As the DM, you need to provide the little extras that make a
scene believable, and you need to be ready to wing it when the player charac-
ters decide to do something that the adventure writer didn’t think of. Be
inventive, be creative, and have fun when these moments occur. In general,
they lead to the scenes that everyone will remember most strongly.
Finally, you need to be responsive to the players. When the players need
more information about what’s around them, provide more detail. Let them
ask questions, and provide the answers in ways that build the story, provide
drama, and still make the players work for the hidden details and the secrets
of the encounter. On the other hand, when the players get bored with your
exposition and want to get to the action, stop talking and start fighting!
Although most of the special effects at your command involve evocative
descriptions, exciting delivery, and abundant imagination, remember that
cool play surfaces and miniatures can help you and the players better visual-
ize the action of the story. Illustrated battle maps, such as those available in
many published adventures and D&D Miniatures products, describe the area
where an encounter takes place. Even dry erase or wet erase battle grids, where
you make a rough sketch of the encounter area, help players get a better idea
about the tactical situation their characters find themselves in. And minia-
tures or other tokens that represent the PCs and the monsters they face pro-
vide all the foundation you need to help everyone’s imagination kick into high
gear. See Chapter 10 for more on using visual and tactical aids in the game.
 DM as Special Effects Wizard Do’s:
• Do treat the game as a cinematic event.
• Do describe what characters can discern with all five senses when
providing narration.
• Do pull out all stops when describing your special effects — you
have an unlimited budget, after all.
• Do be consistent in your descriptions of people, places, and things.
• Do improvise when players try unexpected things.
52
Part I: Running a Great Game 

• Do be responsive to the needs of the players; expand descriptions
when they need more information and cut your narration short
when they’re ready to get to the action.
• Do use battle maps, miniatures, and other visual aids to help the
players better imagine the scene.
 DM as Special Effects Wizard Don’ts:
• Don’t use bland language and technical terms when narrating the
action.
• Don’t use gamespeak (rules, terms, and jargon) when narrating the
story.
• Don’t be arbitrary in your descriptions of people, places, and things.
Playing the nonplayer characters
The players control the heroes of your D&D game, the player characters. You
control all the other characters that inhabit the world — the monsters, the
villains, the patrons, the villagers, and so on. We collectively call this cast of
thousands the nonplayer characters (NPCs). Just like the players, you strive
to give your characters unique personalities and memorable traits. When the
details come together, your NPCs come alive.
All of the NPCs are your characters, and they run the gamut from the shop-
keeper and innkeeper who provide goods and services for the player charac-
ters to the foul vampire lord raising undead monsters in the catacombs
beneath the ruined temple. Although your world might have thousands or
even millions of people in it, you need to deal with only the dozen or so that
the player characters might actually decide to interact with in a given adven-
ture. The following subsections provide some tips for creating and control-
ling interesting nonplayer characters.
Villains and other opponents
As DM, you get to do something unique in the D&D game — you get to play
the bad guys!
For the monsters and opponents that are meant to face the adventurers in a
single encounter, you don’t need to worry about details beyond what you
need to run the encounter. For major villains and recurring opponents, give
some thought to fleshing out their personalities and motivations. Consider
why they’re doing what they’re doing, why they’re in the location where the
player characters encounter them, and how they interact with the things
around them. (This is important when building dungeon environments espe-
cially.) Vary the intelligence of your opponents. Villains don’t have to be
stupid. Make some of your bad guys as dumb as rocks, others as smart as
rocket scientists (or at least the medieval equivalent of rocket scientists),
and let the rest fill the gamut between.
53
Chapter 4: Narrating the Adventure

Don’t be afraid to make your villains totally evil. The worse they are, the
more satisfying it will be for the player characters to defeat them. That said,
not every opponent that sets out to challenge your adventurers needs to be
evil. You might throw in some well-intentioned do-gooders, good NPCs with
an agenda that conflicts with the player characters, or other adventurers
who just want to get to the treasure first, any of which can make for interest-
ing encounters or even whole adventures every now and then.
Sometimes you’ll plan for a villain to have a major role in your campaign.
Other times, an opponent winds up proving just too evil and fun to use up in
a single encounter. That’s when you turn him (or her, or it) into a recurring
character. A recurring villain can be a constant thorn in the side of the adven-
turers or could show up infrequently, when they least expect it, to cause no
end of trouble. 
Allies, innocent bystanders, and everybody else
Although playing villains and monsters certainly takes up a lot of your non-
player character time, you also have to be ready to portray the rest of the
world’s population — at least those that come into contact with the player
characters. These types of NPCs provide information, resources, resting
places, expert assistance, background, obstacles, aid, motivation, amuse-
ment, and more for the player characters. They add color to the story. In
many cases, these NPCs require only a name, a brief description, and a rele-
vant skill or two. Because most if not all of the nonplayer characters that fill
this role are never meant to get into combat, you don’t have to give them a
full set of game statistics (or “statting them out” in gamespeak).
Remember that it’s the player characters’ story and that they should always
get to be the heroes. For this reason, don’t create NPCs that you use to con-
stantly show them up, pull their fat out of the fire, or otherwise leave the
player characters with nothing heroic to do. For example, never craft an
adventure where the player characters need to be inactive to win the day. It
might have worked as the climax to Raiders of the Lost Ark, but you never
want the player characters to close their eyes and do nothing while someone
or something else earns their victory for them. That just isn’t good D&D.
 DM as Nonplayer Character Do’s:
• Do give your nonplayer characters personality by creating quirks,
mannerisms, and oft-repeated phrases.
• Do ham it up and use different voices for different types of charac-
ters. (One DM we know imagines particular actors in the roles of
his NPCs, and he imitates those actors when playing his NPCs. His
imitations are terrible, but they add to the fun and make every NPC
feel unique.)
54
Part I: Running a Great Game 

• Do talk in character and encourage the players to do the same.
• Do be consistent, remember the names and mannerisms of the
NPCs you introduce, and take notes so you can pick them up again
when they appear in a future adventure.
 DM as Nonplayer Character Don’ts:
• Don’t waste time by overstatting your nonplayer characters; give
them only the powers and skills they’ll need for the role you want
them to play in the adventure.
• Don’t use nonplayer characters to overshadow or outshine the
player characters.
• Don’t take the side of the monsters or players when running NPCs;
instead, play NPCs to the fullest without actively making things
easy or difficult for the player characters.
Bringing the Adventure to Life
You’ve figured out how to narrate your adventure. You have a handle on run-
ning the monsters and nonplayer characters. Now all you need to do is make
sure the rest of your adventure is as exciting and dramatic as you can make
it. The following sections provide several ideas to keep in mind, whether
you’re creating your own adventure or using a published one, such as the
adventure in Chapter 19.
Creating fantastic locations
Every DUNGEONS & DRAGONS adventure requires an amazing and imaginative
location to help drive home the fantastic elements of the game. Sometimes
the entire adventure takes place in a single area; other times the adventurers
travel from one fantastic location to another to accomplish their goals. Because
the only limit to the worlds you create is your own imagination, try to think
big, think amazing, think strange and exotic, and think fantastic. Why set an
encounter in just any old woods when you can send the player characters into
the heart of the Everdark Forest? In a world where magic exists, you don’t even
have to be limited by mundane, real-world physics. Let the player characters
scale a mile-high castle tower, or explore a coral maze deep beneath the Blood
Sea, or invade the lava-filled mines deep below the Forbidden Mountains.
No matter what type of encounter you plan to run (combat, challenge, or
roleplaying), you can make the encounter that much more memorable and
55
Chapter 4: Narrating the Adventure

fantastic by setting it in an extraordinary location. Imagine running a battle
along a crystal bridge that spans a jagged chasm or challenging the player
characters to cross a ruined expanse as fountains of flame erupt from the
ground without apparent rhyme or reason. What about presenting a roleplay-
ing encounter in an exotic marketplace filled with fantastic beings of all
descriptions?
The adventure we present in Chapter 19, as well as the advice strewn through-
out Part III, should provide you with plenty of examples of fantastic locations
and advice on how to use them to get your own imagination flowing.
Describing intense battles
At its heart, the D&D game revolves around combat. Heroic adventurers must
often battle foul villains and vile monsters in order to save the day. When you
get to a combat encounter, make sure that you narrate the action in a way
that generates drama and excitement for everyone involved. The selection of
opponents, both how tough they are and how many of them are involved,
takes care of a lot of this, but you still need to bring the intensity and danger
home with your narration of the action.
For example, don’t just relay information in dry gamespeak. Liven it up with
evocative imagery and powerful language. Paint a picture with your words.
The following list shows a boring and a more interesting way of narrating
combat:
 Weak narration: “The hobgoblin attacks.” [DM makes the attack roll.]
“18 — that hits your character.” [DM rolls for damage.] “The hobgoblin
does 6 points of damage. Then it shifts one square away from your char-
acter. Your turn.”
 Stronger narration: “The huge hobgoblin roars a challenge, and the ter-
rible smell of its breath crashes against you like a wave. It swings its
jagged longsword,” [DM makes the hobgoblin’s attack roll, sees that it
succeeds, and rolls for damage] “connecting with a bone-rattling strike
that deals 6 points of damage. With a wicked grin, the hobgoblin leaps
back and barks a guttural laugh as it prepares to strike again.”
Combat encounters demand opponents, a location, complications, and a goal
to make things interesting. The following list briefly examines these concepts:
 Opponents: A normal encounter pits a group of player characters
against multiple opponents, usually with a mix of different types of mon-
sters. Why? Because if you throw a single monster at the party of adven-
turers, it gets to act once for every four (or more) times the player
characters act in a round. That isn’t fun for you, it isn’t a particularly
interesting challenge for the players, and it just doesn’t make for an
56
Part I: Running a Great Game 

exciting encounter. (Solo monsters, such as dragons and beholders, are
designed to work by themselves, but even they can sometimes benefit
from having a little help in the form of weaker and simpler minions.) The
game is designed to let you throw a group of different monsters at your
players’ characters, with the monsters filling different roles just as the
player characters do. 
 Location: Just like in a movie, your scene or encounter will become
more exciting and memorable if it takes place in an exciting and memo-
rable location. Why set up a fight in a plain old dungeon chamber when
you can set it in a dungeon chamber with walls of glistening stone and a
floor of black obsidian that makes for slippery footing? Or what if the
floor is covered in the bones of the monster’s earlier victims? Remember
that anything you can imagine you can throw into your encounter loca-
tions. Not every location needs to be fantastic and complex, so save the
really cool stuff for your major encounters, but don’t be afraid to put a
few twists and some detail into every location you present.
 Complications: Now, don’t overuse this technique, but you can make a
standard combat encounter more exciting and dangerous by throwing in
a complication or two. What do we mean? Well, complications are traps,
hazards, innocents in distress, or anything else that forces the player
characters to split their attention between their opponents and some-
thing else. The slippery floor in the preceding bullet shows one kind of
complication. Suddenly, in addition to battling whatever opponents are
in the encounter, the player characters must also worry about slipping
and falling. Or what if the pile of bones they have to walk over shifts and
slides and sometimes gives way to plunge a character into bony darkness?
 Goal: The goal of most combat encounters is to defeat the opponents
and move on. For example, the player characters might need to fight
their way past the ogres guarding the gate of the evil sorcerer’s keep,
survive the sudden attack of a hungry umber hulk, or slay the foul car-
nage demons that guard the holy relic they seek. How the player charac-
ters achieve that goal makes up the action of the encounter.
Giving the players exciting challenges
Another type of encounter the player characters might face is the skill chal-
lenge encounter. A skill challenge encounter requires many of the same foun-
dation items as seen in the combat encounter. However, the opponent in a
challenge is the challenge itself.
What’s a skill challenge? Fundamentally, it’s a game mechanic that requires
the characters to achieve some number of successful checks before they get
a smaller number of failures, as explained in Chapter 5 of the Dungeon
Master’s Guide. In addition to making skill checks, though, the players might
make ability checks, use spells or tools in clever ways to solve problems, and
57
Chapter 4: Narrating the Adventure

most important, think their way past some obstacle. Traps, natural hazards,
obstinate nonplayer characters, gaping chasms, a fast and furious chase, and
other obstacles can constitute skill challenges.
A skill challenge can also work really well in combination with a combat
encounter, helping to build tension and excitement. You can also pit charac-
ters against multiple challenges at the same time — making them negotiate
with a petulant ghost at the same time as they’re struggling to disarm a deadly
trap, for example. See Chapter 14 for more on crafting good challenge
encounters.
Roleplaying in encounters
All encounters should provide opportunities for roleplaying. In combat
encounters, the player characters might exchange insults and taunts with the
bad guys. In some skill challenge encounters, the player characters might dis-
cuss, in character, the best methods for overcoming the challenge as time
ticks by. Other skill challenge encounters, though, require some amount of
roleplaying as the primary activity in the encounter. 
In these roleplaying-focused encounters, the player characters must talk to,
convince, bluff, bribe, negotiate, intimidate, or otherwise interact with non-
player characters to advance the plot. You could handle these interactions
with plain skill checks, but the same principles of narration that make for
interesting combat encounters apply even more here: You and your players
should never let the result of a die roll pass as narration. When a player rolls
a Diplomacy check, encourage the player to describe what the character is
saying or even to give the speech in character. It’s a great idea to give a
bonus on these checks (+2 is fine) to reward players for throwing themselves
into the drama of the encounter. 
Interactions with NPCs can often lead to combat or another kind of skill chal-
lenge encounter (such as a chase), depending on where the interaction takes
you. Use all the same tricks and narration techniques you would for other
types of encounters, and roleplaying encounters will come together — often in
ways that are more fun and memorable than combat or challenge encounters!

Dealing with Players
In This Chapter
 Examining D&D as a social event
 Understanding the game group concept
 Exploring the relationship between players and DMs
 Dealing with mistakes
 Exploring the idea of sharing the DM role
T
he Dungeon Master has a unique relationship with the other players. In
this chapter, we focus on the interaction between DM and players and
how to use that interaction to make for a more memorable and enjoyable
gaming experience.
D&D: A Social Experience
Some people go bowling every Saturday night. Some people get together every
other Thursday for a few hands of poker. Some people meet up once a week to
have dinner parties, to watch DVDs, or to play board games. Some people 
do all these things and more and still find time to have a weekly or monthly
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game session. Just like any other social experience, a D&D
game requires a time, a place, and a group of friends. The best way to keep
your game group together and ensure that everyone wants to return for each
session (and in most cases, can’t wait for the next session) is to remember that
a D&D session is a social experience and to treat it accordingly.
D&D is a game. A game session needs to be fun. D&D is a social experience.
Social experiences need to be fun. (See a pattern developing here?) The best
way to maximize your fun potential is to make sure that everything you need
to feed both the game and the social experience is ready and available for 
the game session. Make sure that everyone in the game group shares in this
aspect of the session — no one player (not even the DM) should be responsi-
ble for bringing all these things together. Social experiences require locations

and participants. In the case of D&D, you need a place to play and you need
players. Social experiences need refreshments. For a D&D game, this could
include a full meal (lunch or dinner) at most, snacks and drinks at least. Make
sure that whatever plan you choose is agreed upon by the rest of the group
and that everyone shares in the expense. Finally, you need the game itself,
and that’s mostly in the hands of the Dungeon Master to provide.
If you skipped Chapter 2, take a look at that chapter before pulling together a
game session. It shows you how to prepare to run a game session. The rest of
this chapter discusses the relationship between the DM and the players.
Looking at the Game Group
A D&D game group consists of at least one Dungeon Master (though some-
times multiple players share this role) and a number of players that regularly
get together for the express purpose of socializing and playing the DUNGEONS
& DRAGONS game. Some game groups have just enough players, but others
have a bigger membership with the idea that not everyone can make it to
every game session. A few groups have such a small membership that play-
ers routinely control multiple characters in an adventure.
None of these group models is inherently better than the others. You work
with what you have or what you feel comfortable with to get to the ultimate
goal — to have fun playing D&D.
Comparing DMs and Players
The Dungeon Master’s primary role, especially from the players’ perspective
(though most players might not consciously realize this), is to help the play-
ers find the fun in the game. This happens in subtle ways, as the DM sets up
situations, encounters, and adventure hooks. It happens in overt ways, when
the DM controls the pacing of a scene to get the player characters to where
the action is — even if the DM has to bring the action to them. Sometimes
players fumble around following a false lead or going after an incidental
occurrence that has caught their imagination but has nothing to do with the
adventure the DM is running. In such a case, you might steer them back on
track by inserting an encounter that gets them back into your plot, or you
might wing it and see where the players’ interest takes you. Winging it is a
little harder, though, and we discuss the fine art of making stuff up for the
sake of keeping the game moving in Chapter 10.
60
Part I: Running a Great Game 

Being the DM
The first rule to remember when you’re the Dungeon Master is that neither
you nor the players can learn everything at once. As you learn the rules, dis-
cuss them with the players so that they learn them, too. Take it slowly and
have fun, and everything will work out fine.
Your role as the DM is to make the game fun for the players and for yourself.
Nothing else should take priority over this DM responsibility. Whatever con-
stitutes a fun experience for you and the players is the right way to go, even if
that style of play goes against everything we say in these pages. That said,
use this advice and tailor it so that it applies to you and your game group.
Your best skill, one that we can’t teach you in the game or in this book, is
communication. That’s the key to excelling at all of the many roles that the
DM must fill in the game. Become not only a good speaker but a good listener,
and you will transform from a good DM into a great one.
Interacting with players
The following list provides pointers to help you interact and communicate
with the players in the best possible way:
 Be fair. You need to earn the trust of the players. When they trust you to
treat their characters fairly, they’ll cheerfully ignore rules mistakes and
hesitations in the action as long as they believe you’re playing fair and
that you aren’t picking on them. 
 Be consistent. If a rule works a specific way on one encounter, it should
work that way all the time. If a nonplayer character has a limp and talks
with a strange accent, that character should behave the same way the
next time the player characters meet him or her.
 Be impartial. You may play the monsters and villains as smart and pow-
erful or dumb and weak, depending on their role in the adventure, but
you still need to impartially interpret the rules when it comes to resolv-
ing actions between PCs and NPCs. If you don’t deal impartially in this
area, you will lose the trust of the players. And that’s bad for you and for
the game group.
As DM, you sometimes have to mediate disagreements between players,
and in these situations you need to be impartial as well. Whether the
players can’t agree over the best way to divide treasure, or if one player’s
action harms another player’s character, or whatever the issue winds up
61
Chapter 5: Dealing with Players

being, you need to help them reach a fair and equitable resolution so
that everyone can get back to the game. The game is fun; arguments
aren’t fun. Mediate the conflict with calm words, logic, and good humor.
And, when all else fails, let the dice decide. Who gets the +2 safewing
amulet? Maybe the character who doesn’t have a +2 cloak or amulet yet,
who would benefit most from it, or the character whose player rolls the
highest result on a d20.
 Be entertaining. You are the narrator and the cast of thousands that
inhabit the world. You are the window through which the players experi-
ence the fun and adventure, so strive to be as entertaining as possible.
Play your villains and monsters with gusto. Make the players really
despise or hate or feel sorry for the bad guy, as appropriate to the story.
Use evocative and exciting language to describe environments, scenes,
and the action of the adventure. Make every moment action-packed, 
suspense-filled, scary, funny, or tense, as appropriate for the scene and
the situation. When the whole group gets caught up in the fun of the
story, that’s entertainment!
 Be prepared. You don’t do yourself or the players any favors if you
aren’t ready to run the game session. Better to engage in a different
activity than to try to run a D&D adventure when you haven’t made all
the necessary preparations. You can alleviate some of the work by
selecting a ready-to-run adventure, such as the ones presented in this
book, but even then you need to read and review that material before
sitting down to run the game. When you use published adventures,
study the way they’re designed so you can use some of the same tricks
when you get around to crafting your own adventures. If you’re orga-
nized, ready, and prepared, the game session will run that much more
smoothly.
62
Part I: Running a Great Game 
It isn’t a competition
You aren’t competing against the players. The
D&D roleplaying game is a cooperative game,
not a competitive one. The victory conditions
consist of having fun and telling an exciting
group story. The player characters work together
to accomplish their team goals; they don’t seek
to beat, defeat, or otherwise achieve individual
wins.
Likewise, it isn’t you against them. Even though
the DM runs the monsters and villains, the DM
doesn’t win the game by defeating the player
characters. Sure, that result might happen
occasionally, as long as it happens fairly and
still leads to a satisfying story. Many players’
D&D memories include great tales of sorrow
and tragedy as the heroes went down in a blaze
of glory against a powerful and hated foe. But
this should be the natural outcome of good and
fair play. Never use your powers as DM to go
out of your way to destroy the player charac-
ters. That isn’t fair. It’s just mean and will lead to
the disintegration of your game group. It all goes
back to that trust thing.

What do you want out of the game?
Here’s a great discussion topic for you and the game group to bat around before
you get too far into your D&D play: What does everyone want out of the game?
As DM, you should honestly tell the players why you want to run D&D, what
you hope to get out of it, and how you imagine the campaign developing if
everyone sticks with it. Initially, this might be as simple as saying, “I want to
try this roleplaying game thing because it looks interesting and I think it will
be fun.” Later, you might develop deeper goals related to creativity, story-
telling, world-building, and so on. Or, you might still just want to run D&D
games because it’s a fun thing to do.
Players might have all kinds of reasons for wanting to play, but initially they
might not have any expectations. Some players like the creativity of building
a character and playing a role, immersing themselves in the story and the
fantasy of D&D. Others like the action and combat aspects of the game, and
the highlights for them occur every time a new monster arrives on the scene
to challenge them. Others get into the game mechanics, looking to maximize
their characters through smart play and statistical optimization. 
This eventually leads to deciding on the style of D&D game you want to run
to best meet these expectations. Chapter 9 goes into this topic in more depth
because it isn’t something you should try to figure out as a new Dungeon
Master. That said, here’s a brief rundown on some typical game styles so you
can get a sense about the different styles of the D&D game:
 Hack-and-slash: A straightforward, action-oriented style of play that
focuses on fighting monsters and getting treasure. Little time is spent
developing the roleplaying side of player characters, you provide few
encounters that don’t involve combat, and the story never strays very
far from the dungeon. This style is also called kick in the door adventur-
ing. We usually refer to players who prefer this style of play as power
gamers. Power gamers typically work to maximize their statistics and
abilities to take full advantage of the game mechanics.
 Deep-immersion storytelling: Talking, roleplaying, and developing com-
plex personas for every player character take center stage in this style
of play. Entire game sessions might pass without a single die being
rolled. The story is the thing here, as well as character development and
character interaction. Combat encounters are few and far between as
adventures deal with intrigue, negotiations, and political maneuvering.
We usually refer to players who prefer this style of play as roleplayers.
 Something in between: More than likely, your campaign and play style will
eventually develop into something that falls somewhere between the hack-
and-slash and deep-immersion storytelling extremes. The best adventures
have a good mix of action, story, and interaction to keep all players happy.
63
Chapter 5: Dealing with Players

In the end, there’s no right or wrong way to play D&D. Just match the style to
the overall personality and desires of the group so that everyone can have
fun playing the game.
Increasing the fun quotient
The DM can increase the game group’s fun quotient by following these simple
principles:
 Understand the players. Although discussing what they might want out
of the game is a good start, a DM also has to observe indirect cues and
play patterns to fully understand the players.
 Provide something for everyone. When you figure out what the players
want (through discussion, observation, or both), you can adjust the
adventures to cater to each of them. Depending on the group, you can
deal with this collectively (by adjusting the play style) or individually
(by providing encounters that speak to each player in turn).
 Maintain a high level of energy. Players take their cues from the DM, 
so you need to keep your enthusiasm up, your level of energy high, and
your sense of excitement focused and on track. The players will respond
and perform likewise.
 Move it, move it, move it. Pacing is everything. Never take away the
players’ sense of control over the actions of their characters, but
develop the skills to nudge them along or reshape the adventure to mini-
mize slow periods, keep the action going, and help bring the players
back to the fun.
Periodically look around the gaming table and ask yourself this question: Are
we having fun? If the answer is “yes,” don’t worry too much about pacing and
action. If your group is enjoying a long negotiation with a swaggering bug-
bear, let the scene play out. If you look around and see players fiddling with
their dice, looking bored, or starting to get distracted, the answer must be a
resounding “no.” That’s when you need to make an adjustment, move the
adventure along, and help the players find the fun. When all else fails, have a
wandering monster show up, or have a villain kick in the door, or have some
other event occur to get the group back to the action.
Setting Ground Rules and Expectations
To help you get along with the players, we suggest that you work together 
to establish some ground rules that have nothing to do with the game itself
but can help everyone know what to expect from the interactions around the
64
Part I: Running a Great Game 

table. The following sections describe some of the issues that might eventu-
ally crop up around the gaming table. It helps if you discuss these things with
the players and decide on answers before you get too far into your campaign.
This section expands on the discussion of DM style on page 12 of the
Dungeon Master’s Guide and the section on table rules on pages 14–15. Be
sure to check that latter section for advice on related issues, such as han-
dling missing characters or letting players run multiple characters.
Choosing a theme and style
If you imagine the D&D game you want to run as a movie, what’s the movie
like? What’s the soundtrack? Is it a sweeping, grandiose epic like The Lord of
the Rings, with a symphonic score, tear-jerking moments of self-sacrificing hero-
ics, and pulse-pounding battles against sinister foes? Is it more like the quirky
humor of Pirates of the Caribbean, combining swashbuckling action and creepy
monsters with wisecracking humor and physical comedy, underscored by
music that swings between nautical jigs, sinister foreboding, and upbeat action?
Is it a horror movie with shrieking strings, or a comedy with a laugh track?
Movies and soundtracks are an easy way to think about the theme and style
of your D&D campaign. At the game table, the visuals are in your mind and
the imaginations of your players, but the game plays more smoothly if you’re
all watching the same kind of movie — if one of your players is the guy who
always laughs in a horror movie, it might be hard to hit the tone you’re look-
ing for. Using background music as a prop helps reinforce the tone and get all
the players on the same page, especially if you select your soundtrack with
the same care that film directors do. (Tip: If you want sweeping and epic,
remove the “Concerning Hobbits” track from the Fellowship of the Ring
soundtrack in your playlist.)
One of the most important elements of style you need to consider is how
much humor you’re after in your D&D campaign. Either a grand epic or a silly
romp in the spirit of Monty Python and the Holy Grail can provide a fun experi-
ence for you and your players, but it’s better if you and the players agree on
how you want to approach your fantasy before getting too far into an adven-
ture. Nothing can destroy a game group faster than a DM intent on running a
serious game when the players want to crack jokes and turn everything into a
comedy. Bear in mind that even the most serious stories benefit from moments
of humor, especially in the form of a wise-cracking hero or a funny villain. 
We recommend that you approach your campaign and the adventures that
comprise it in a serious manner. Let the humor come naturally, with you play-
ing it straight so that the tone remains heroic and fantastic. Keep the in-game
action tense and suspenseful, though it can be fun to throw in the occasional
light-hearted encounter or adventure. 
65
Chapter 5: Dealing with Players

Adding new players
Players come and players go. It happens. People move. People get busy.
People decide that they want to do something else with their time. Hopefully,
you’ll also have new players waiting in the wings to join the group when this
happens. First, discuss a potential new player with the group to make sure
everyone is comfortable with this person joining them. Then bring the new
player up to speed on the campaign and the various house rules that you and
the group use. Finally, you have to integrate the new character into the cam-
paign in a logical and fun way. The group can meet the new character on the
road, rescue him or her from the dungeon, find him or her at a guild hall, or
any number of other ways you and the players can imagine. 
You also need to decide at what level to start the new character. We recom-
mend that the new player create a character that is the same level as the rest
of the game group. So, if the players have 5th-level characters in the game,
have the new player create a 5th-level character to join them.
Bringing books
What books do you want the players to have at the table, and do you want to
allow them to reference them during the game? In general, the only thing you
probably don’t want players looking up during an adventure are the statistics
in the Monster Manual of the monsters you just surprised them with, but
that’s up to you.
New D&D game supplements come out all the time. You need to decide how
you want to introduce new rules or content from these supplements into the
game. When you find a new supplement or rule that you want to add to the
game, we recommend that you inform the players of this during one of your
after-session discussions. This way, they can explore the book and come
back to you if they find something in it they want to try with their characters
(new powers, feats, classes, paragon paths, or whatever). For new monsters
or magic items, no discussion is needed. Just drop the new feature into the
next logical location in your adventure.
On the other hand, players will also pick up D&D supplements that interest
them, and you should encourage them to discuss with you any content they
would like to try out in the game. If it looks okay to you, work with the player
to make the new content available in your campaign.
However you decide to handle this, we encourage you to use a BYOB policy.
It just makes good sense for everyone to “Bring Your Own Books” to the
game. A player, for example, should have his or her own copy of the Player’s
66
Part I: Running a Great Game 

Handbook instead of constantly borrowing someone else’s during or after the
game. 
Players shouldn’t need to bring an armload of books to every game session.
Most players can get by just fine with between one and four books: the
Player’s Handbook at minimum, and also the book the character’s class
appears in, if it’s not the Player’s Handbook. Many players will also want
access to the power source book for their characters’ class. If you’re running
a game set in a published campaign world, your players might want the
Player’s Guide for that world. So a player with a dwarf fighter in a generic D&D
setting just needs the Player’s Handbook and maybe Martial Power. A player
playing a gnome bard in the FORGOTTEN REALMS setting needs the Player’s
Handbook, Player’s Handbook II (where the gnome race and bard class both
appear), perhaps Arcane Power, and the FORGOTTEN REALMS Player’s Guide.
(Note that Player’s Handbook II and Arcane Power will be published in 2009,
and so may not yet be available as you read this.)
As DM, you might want to have more books on hand, which can be a good
reason to play at your house. On the other hand, if you’re running a pub-
lished adventure, all you really need is the Player’s Handbook, the Dungeon
Master’s Guide, and the adventure, which should contain all the monster sta-
tistics and other information you need to run it. If you run a campaign in a
published setting, you’ll want the Campaign Guide for that setting on hand 
as well. 
Managing off-topic discussions
Insist that the players get all their off-topic discussions concerning work,
school, new movies, the latest episodes of favorite TV shows, or whatever
out of the way during the pre-game socializing period. During the game,
everyone needs to stay focused on their characters and the adventure. 
Still, people talk, and D&D is a social experience. Play it by ear and try to
keep everything fun, but you don’t want the entire game session to devolve
into jokes and chatter. You’re there to play D&D, after all.
Considering computers
It’s increasingly common for players to bring laptops to the table so that they
can keep records of their characters, notes on the campaign, and resources
to reference. This is usually okay, unless you have players who spend so
much time typing and looking at the screen that they aren’t paying attention
to the game. 
67
Chapter 5: Dealing with Players

The computer can also be a powerful tool for you to use as the DM, but not if
it draws your attention away from the table and takes up too much time.
Using the programs that are part of D&D Insider, you can use a computer
screen (or a large-screen TV attached to your computer!) as a battle grid,
with personalized virtual miniatures for each character. You can use the com-
puter to track initiative and the status of characters and monsters (hit points
and conditions). You can even use the Internet as your game table, assem-
bling a gaming group of players who can’t meet face-to-face. Chapter 12 offers
more suggestions for using the Internet to enhance your game.
68
Part I: Running a Great Game 
Who rolls the dice?
As a general rule, we recommend that you roll
the dice for all monsters and NPCs and that the
players roll the dice for their characters.
However, sometimes a die roll can reveal more
than you want the players to know. For exam-
ple, if a player rolls to search for a trap in a dun-
geon corridor, any result will color how that
player treats that corridor moving forward. A
poor roll tells the player that her character
should proceed cautiously, because a trap
could be somewhere ahead. A good roll, on the
other hand, reveals a hidden trap or sounds the
all-clear, allowing the characters to proceed
without a care in the world. The adventure pro-
ceeds more satisfyingly if the player doesn’t
know for sure whether his or her character suc-
ceeded at the Perception check, or the Stealth
check, for example. 
In cases where players shouldn’t know the
result of a die roll, the DM should make the roll
in secret. Consider making the following skill
checks for the players, rolling the dice in secret: 
 Bluff
 Diplomacy
 Insight
 Perception
 Stealth
It won’t destroy the game to let the players make
these rolls, but you keep some of the suspense
and tension up if you make the rolls for them.
How do you narrate these types of situations?
Well, if you roll the dice for the player charac-
ters’ Perception checks, for example, you tell
them what they perceive. Failed rolls indicate
that you should narrate the scene without
revealing anything unusual about the forest
ahead, but successful rolls tell you to find a way
to slip hints into your narration. Of course, a
failed check and a check when there is nothing
unusual to notice sound a lot the same when
you narrate them. Here’s what we mean:
 Failed Perception checks or checks made
when there’s nothing unusual to notice:
“You scan the forest ahead and strain to
hear any unusual sounds. A calm wind rus-
tles the leaves of the overhanging trees,
and birds chirp as they hop among the
branches. You hear the distant rush of
water from a nearby river.”
 Successful Perception checks when
there’s something unusual to notice: “You
scan the forest ahead and strain to hear any
unusual sounds. A calm wind rustles the
leaves of the overhanging trees, and birds
chirp as they hop among the branches. You
hear the distant rush of water from a nearby
river. You also catch a few whispered words
that you can’t make out and the tiniest glint
of sunlight on metal. Someone must be
hiding up ahead, trying not to be seen or
heard.”

Sharing DM Duties
Being the Dungeon Master is fun! Why should you get to have all that fun by
yourself? And why shouldn’t you get to be a player every now and then? You
and your group can use a number of approaches to spread the fun around
and let everyone have a turn behind the DM screen — or everyone who
wants a turn, anyway.
Guest DMs
Even if you’re the primary DM for your group and the group is happy with
that arrangement, sometimes someone else in your game group might want
to try his or her hand at DMing the game. One way to give this player a turn
behind the screen is to treat him or her as a temporary “guest star” DM. You
continue with the campaign that you have already established, allowing the
other players to continue playing the characters they have created and
advanced, while you step into the role of player for an adventure and another
player takes over the DMing duties for a while. This gives you a chance to
just play a single character and experience the fun of seeing the adventure
unfold from the other side of the table. It gives the other player a chance to
be the DM, and the game can never have too many DMs.
If you have a really energized and creative group, you might have a number of
players who would love to get a crack at being the DM. Let them each run an
adventure over the course of a few sessions, with you picking up the cam-
paign either between their adventures or after a few months of guest DMs.
This can be a one-shot experience, or if everyone wants to, you can establish
regular schedules for each DM to run an adventure for the group. The story
retains continuity as long as everyone uses the same campaign and player
characters, but the game group also gets to experience the variety and cre-
ativity of different styles of DMing.
Shared-world campaign
In Wizards of the Coast’s line of FORGOTTEN REALMS novels, many different
authors tell their own stories within the context of a single campaign setting.
Around the world, thousands and thousands of DMs tell their own stories in
the same setting. If your game group has multiple people who want a regular
turn behind the DM screen, a good way to make that happen is to use a shared
world. If you can agree on a single setting for the campaign — whether it’s a
published setting like the FORGOTTEN REALMS or EBERRON, a setting based on
books you’ve all read, or something you create together — you can divide up
the world and let each DM tell his or her own stories in a defined portion of
the world. Characters can travel from region to region, so individual players
69
Chapter 5: Dealing with Players

can use the same characters in adventures run by different DMs. Or you can
have different sets of characters for each DM’s part of the world. 
The big advantage of a shared-world campaign is the potential for crossover.
Even if you normally have different characters for each DM’s adventures, you
have the potential to mix them up once in a while. Events in one DM’s adven-
tures can have an impact in the other DMs’ games. For a really special event,
you can bring characters together, letting each player run two or three char-
acters for a special adventure, perhaps the climax of a tier of play. 
Multiple campaigns
Of course, you can also just let different DMs run their own campaigns, taking
turns over the course of months or years to let each DM tell the stories that
he or she wants to tell. This lets your game group not only experience differ-
ent DMing styles, but also play in a variety of different campaign worlds. Each
player makes a new character for use in each new campaign.
This means that the group switches playing styles and characters a lot, but
that isn’t necessarily a bad thing. For example, our game group consists of
Bill, Rich, Michele, Kim, James, and Chris. Bill, Rich, and Michele all take
turns as the DM. Bill runs an EBERRON game when he DMs, and the other play-
ers all create characters that fit into that setting. Rich runs a FORGOTTEN
REALMS campaign, with a more classic and high-fantasy feel than Bill’s game.
Michele runs something different, using a variation on the D&D rules,
designed for running adventures in the modern world, to create a campaign
where all the players run characters that work for a top-secret agency of
super spies. With each DM in the group running a game in a different cam-
paign setting, the group experiences a whole lot of variety, which keeps this
particular game group fresh and exciting.

D
epending on the makeup of your game group and how often players join
or leave the group, eventually the task will fall to you to teach someone
how to play the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. Consider this a wonderful oppor-
tunity to help spread the word about the game you love to play. By teaching
the game, you not only create new players for your game group (ensuring
that you always have people to play D&D with), but you can make certain
that you explain the rules in a way that best complements the game you like
to run. 
Share your hobby with others, and it will grow and prosper. As we’ve said
time and again: Play more D&D, it’s good for you! For DMs, we amend that
and say: Teach more D&D, it’s good for everyone!
In this chapter, we suggest using the key elements of D&D (which we describe
in more detail in the “Teaching Key Elements to New Players” section, later in
this chapter) as the model for how you teach the game to new players. Using
the key elements approach, you introduce new players to D&D in the follow-
ing stages:
1. Provide new players with a brief overview about what D&D is and the
campaign world you run.
2. Give new players a lesson on using the core mechanic and what their
characters can do in the game.
3. Walk them through the character sheet. This is necessary whether you’re
preparing the new players to create characters or to use ready-to-play
characters that you provide.

4. Run through the key nongame aspects of your group’s game, such as
when you play, where, and what responsibilities the group shares.
5. Take new players through a game session. The best way to learn the
game is to see it in action in a game session. 
Make sure you keep the new player’s first game session moving at a pace that
encourages question asking and answering, and take the time to explain game
concepts to the new players as they come up.
At the end of this chapter, we also highlight some of the key changes that
make the 4th Edition of the D&D game different from past editions. Whether
you have a whole group of experienced players transitioning to 4th Edition,
or you’re just trying to help one such player get up to speed, this section can
help with a quick summary of some of the biggest changes. 
Dungeon Master as Teacher
No matter how clearly we write the rules of the game, how many DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS Roleplaying Game Starter Set packages we create, how many For
Dummies books we write, or how many online game demos we build, the fact
of the matter is that the easiest way to learn a game like DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
is to sit down with a group that already knows how and just play. The con-
cepts and activities are just novel enough to make some people scratch their
heads when they try to wrap their minds around it without actually seeing
the game in action. The reality is that the game, at its core, isn’t really that
hard or that complex. Getting to that core, however, can sometimes be tricky.
When you introduce new players to the game, remember that players who
are taught by a good teacher in a fun game are more likely to have positive
experiences with D&D. Fun experiences provide them with a foundation that
can be built upon, and they’re more likely to become D&D players for life.
Consider it an honor and a privilege to be able to introduce new players to
your favorite game. Be patient with new players. Make them feel welcome
and try to make the learning as fun and as simple as possible. Don’t get frus-
trated because a new player doesn’t understand all the rules right out of the
gate. Use this opportunity to encourage the new player to become the sort of
gamer you want to play games with. Answer all questions in simple terms,
trying not to use too much jargon or gamespeak. You should stick to the
basics of the game, though, and let some of the answers come as you play.
For you as the DM to be a good teacher, you need to keep a few things in
mind, as we discuss in the following sections. 
72
Part I: Running a Great Game 

Teaching the basic rules
To teach the game, you need to have a clear understanding of the basic rules of
D&D. These key elements usually figure into the first things you teach a new
player when explaining the game. We discuss these key elements in more detail
later in this chapter (in the “Teaching Key Elements to New Players” section).
The big thing to remember is that you shouldn’t try to teach all the rules of the
game at once. That’s too much for you to do, too much for the new player to
absorb, and frankly, nobody needs to know all those rules right off the bat.
When you teach the game, we recommend giving a rundown of the basics and
then getting the new player right into the action. Seeing the rules in play and
having fun playing are the best ways to learn D&D.
Showing how to create a character
You need to understand how to create D&D characters so that you can help a
new player make a new player character. Ask the new player what kind of
character he or she wants to play. Then point the new player to the right
class and race to help him or her get going. If the new player doesn’t know or
have an idea for a character, briefly explain the race and class options and
see whether anything interests the player. 
Sometimes providing a new player with a ready-to-play character (such as
the ones in Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition For Dummies) works best for the
73
Chapter 6: Teaching the Game

purposes of teaching the game. After the new player gets a feel for things, he
or she will have a better sense of the kind of character he or she wants to
create and play for the long haul. 
You also need to give the new player a quick rundown on the character sheet,
so he or she knows how to read it. Just hit the highlights (as detailed later in
this chapter in the section “Explaining the most important parts of the char-
acter sheet”); the rest of the sheet will make sense when the player needs to
refer to it.
Relaxing and having fun playing the game
D&D is a game. It’s fun! When you teach a new player, you need to relax and
have fun so that the new player relaxes and has fun, too.
A new player doesn’t want to get bogged down in the rules and doesn’t need
to know what every number or statistic on his or her character sheet means.
You can help keep things fun and relaxed for both you and the new player by
saving the more intricate rules and statistics for when they come up in play. 
Making Use of Helpful Aids
A number of aids are available to help you teach new players how to play the
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. We review these aids and how to best use them for
this purpose in the following sections.
D&D Roleplaying Game Starter Set
The DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Roleplaying Game Starter Set is designed specifically
to serve as a first D&D roleplaying experience. It comes with a configurable
dungeon play surface, ready-to-play characters, ready-to-play adventure sce-
narios, basic rules, dice, Dungeon Tiles, and tokens for characters and mon-
sters. You can use it to discover how to DM, to bring a new game group up to
speed, or to teach new players the game. Or, you can use parts of it for any of
those purposes.
Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition 
For Dummies
The companion volume to this book, Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition For
Dummies, explains the D&D game in simple, clear language. You can refer to it
74
Part I: Running a Great Game 

for advice on how to present the game’s concepts to new players, or to brush
up on your own understanding of the game. It makes great reading for new
players, and we suggest that you let the new players know that it can help
them get up to speed very quickly. It also contains ready-to-play characters
that new players can use, and it features an adventure that you can run, either
as an introduction to the game or just as part of your ongoing campaign.
Keep on the Shadowfell
The first 4th Edition adventure, Keep on the Shadowfell provides a ready-to-
play adventure and more. It also includes pregenerated characters, quick-
start rules for both players and the DM, and wonderfully illustrated battle
maps of fantastic locations in various parts of the adventure. The maps in
particular can really help bring the adventure to life for new players.
Dungeons & Dragons Miniatures
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Miniatures starter sets and booster packs provide color-
ful, plastic miniature figures depicting a huge variety of characters and mon-
sters from the D&D world. Accessories such as battle maps and miniatures
are especially helpful for new players because they give the game a more tra-
ditional look (board and pieces) and help players better visualize the situa-
tions you throw at them. The tactical elements of the D&D game are best
served with some kind of visual representations, so you might as well use the
coolest and best-looking visual representations you can find. Plus, players
love to associate their characters with a special and specific miniature figure.
Teaching Key Elements to New Players
The following sections present one method for teaching the D&D game to
new players. It isn’t the only way, and after a while you’ll develop your own
method and style. But here are some advice and examples to help you out
the first few times you get to bring new players into the fold.
Explaining the premise of D&D
Start out by giving the new player a little background. What is the DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS game? It’s a roleplaying game. It’s kind of like a tabletop version of a
computer game, or a grown-up and sophisticated version of make-believe. It
lets players participate in exciting adventures in an imaginary world of magic
and monsters, where the only limit to what the player characters can do is
the players’ imaginations.
75
Chapter 6: Teaching the Game

You might find that new players have experience with other kinds of games
that are similar to D&D in some important ways. Anyone who has played a
massively multiplayer online roleplaying game (such as World of Warcraft or
even Dungeons & Dragons Online: Stormreach) has a basic understanding of
some key elements of the D&D game — you create a character, control that
character through multiple adventures or quests, fight monsters, and advance
in levels. Even someone who has played a Pokémon electronic game has
some exposure to these basic concepts, as well as rules elements like hit
points. Use the new player’s knowledge and experience, whatever it is, to
make the transition into D&D easier.
D&D is different from many other games in the following ways:
 The player creates and plays a character. In a D&D game, the player
plays a character that he or she creates. This character improves over
time, becoming more powerful and more famous in the imaginary world
where your adventures take place. A character is defined by race (human,
dwarf, or elf, for example); class (fighter, cleric, or wizard, for example);
game statistics; and the personality the player develops for the charac-
ter as he or she plays the game. This is similar to what you do in an
online game, but D&D gives you much more freedom and flexibility to
create the character you want to play.
 Play continues. When the player creates a character for a D&D game, 
he or she plays that character from one game session to the next. The
adventures are kind of like an ongoing television series, and the player
characters are the stars. With each adventure the player participates in,
his or her character grows and develops, becomes more powerful, and
generally takes on greater and greater challenges as the campaign
unfolds. Again, this is similar to an online game — but in D&D, you don’t
do the same adventure more than once, and the things you do in one
adventure can have important effects on later adventures.
 Nothing limits the action. Unlike board games or computer games, there
are no limits to what a player character can do in a D&D game. Not only
can the character attempt to do anything imaginable within the confines
of the character’s powers and abilities, the game also offers endless
adventure possibilities and a multitude of choices for developing a char-
acter over time.
 Everyone wins. The D&D game is cooperative. The players work
together to overcome the challenges the Dungeon Master presents. The
DM presents adventures and narrates the action. In this way, players
and DM play the game and tell a group story. If the characters survive
and overcome the challenges (or die spectacularly and memorably while
trying) and everyone has a fun and exciting time, then everyone wins.
76
Part I: Running a Great Game 

Describing the world of D&D
No matter what setting you play in, the world of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
game consists of a number of constant factors that remain true across every
campaign. Some of these are defined by the background story of the game,
and some by the rules of the game. These constant factors include:
 A medieval world: A D&D world is modeled after a fantastic version of
the medieval period of European history. It’s an imaginary, magical ver-
sion that comes out of story books and legends more than out of any
actual history text. The technology of the world matches what you prob-
ably think of when you think of the world of King Arthur, Robin Hood, or
The Lord of the Rings (books or movies). People travel on foot or on
horseback, gunpowder doesn’t exist, and most battles occur using hand-
held weapons such as clubs and maces and swords. The world contains
castles and dark forests and knights and monsters, among other things.
 A magical world: Everything of fantasy exists in a D&D world, from fan-
tastical creatures to magic spells to powerful arcane items. A forest
might be an enchanted forest or a cursed forest. Good wizards and evil
high priests abound. And player characters might find all kinds of magic
items and artifacts — often as a result of a long and harrowing adventure
or quest of some sort.
 A world of monsters: In addition to all kinds of magic, a D&D world is
inhabited by monsters of every description and disposition. Monster is
kind of a generic term, because monsters can be good or evil, helpful or
harmful, depending on the situation and the adventure. From great drag-
ons to small goblins, monsters come in all shapes and sizes.
Showing how to use the core mechanic
The core mechanic of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game is that you roll a d20 and
hope to roll high. Everything else is just details.
You resolve any action in the game that has a possibility of failure associated
with it (and a subsequent meaningful consequence) by using the core
mechanic. These actions include making an attack, using a skill, or using an
ability. To determine whether an action succeeds, follow these steps:
1. Roll a d20.
2. Add any relevant modifiers. You can explain to a new player that a modi-
fier is a bonus or penalty that is added to the d20 die roll. Modifiers
77
Chapter 6: Teaching the Game

come from a variety of game statistics, such as ability scores and skills,
and always include one-half the character’s level.
3. Compare the result to a target number.
The DM sets the target number either by using numbers that are predetermined
(such as the Difficulty Class of a lock or a monster’s Armor Class) or by deter-
mining a target number using the rulebooks and the relative difficulty of the task
as a guide. If the result is equal to or greater than the target number, the action
succeeds. If the resulting number is less than the target number, the action fails.
Explaining what a character can do
The D&D game is played fairly loose until a tactical situation (such as a combat
encounter or some skill challenge encounters) comes up. Then everyone plays
the game in rounds. In a round, a character can try to do anything the player
can imagine, but that’s structured within the different types of actions. On a
player’s turn in combat, the character can take up to three actions: 
 A standard action, which usually means using a power
 A move action, which almost always means moving one or more squares
 A minor action
78
Part I: Running a Great Game 

Remember to explain that you can take a move or minor action instead of a
standard action, or a minor action instead of a move action. Most often, char-
acters do this in order to move twice, but occasionally characters attack and
use two minor actions.
Explaining character role
Character classes in the D&D game put a character into one of four roles,
which primarily determine the key functions that character performs in
combat. The four roles are defender, striker, leader, and controller. When
you’re teaching a new player how to play the game, it’s more important for
the player to understand the character’s role than to get how a class fills that
role. The player of a fighter or paladin, for example, needs to know that the
defender’s job is to stand up in the front of the other characters and get
attacked. The character roles are defined on page 16 of the Player’s
Handbook, but here’s a quick pointer for new players:
 Defender: High defense means you can stand up to monster attacks and
protect the other players. You stand toe-to-toe with monsters and pin them
down so they don’t go after the more vulnerable characters in the party.
 Striker: High offense makes you good at dishing out damage to one mon-
ster at a time. You move around a lot, either making ranged attacks or
darting in and out of melee combat.
 Controller: You’re all about controlling the field of battle, dishing out lots
of damage to groups of monsters or restricting their actions. Low defenses
and hit points mean you want to stay out of reach of monster attacks.
 Leader: You might not actually lead the party, but like the best leaders,
you make everyone better at what they do. You’re the primary healer for
the group.
Explaining the most important 
parts of the character sheet
You need to walk a new player through the parts of the character sheet that
come into play most often during the game. The sheet has a lot of stuff on it.
Tell the player that the following bits are the most important parts and that
you’ll explain everything else when it comes up in the game:
 Character class and level: A character’s class defines how he or she fills
one of the roles — clerics and warlords are both leaders, for example,
but they fill that role in different ways. Level is a relative measure of how
powerful the character is. 
79
Chapter 6: Teaching the Game

 HP: This lists the character’s hit points. When a monster or other oppo-
nent successfully attacks the character, the player subtracts the amount
of damage from the character’s current hit point total. When the charac-
ter’s hit points are reduced to 0 or less, he or she is defeated and out of
the fight.
You can save the big discussion on the specifics of character death and
dying for later in the game.
 Healing surges: A character can be healed only a certain number of
times per day, which is the character’s number of healing surges. Each
time the character receives healing, he or she regains hit points equal to
his or her healing surge value, which is one-quarter of the character’s
normal maximum hit points. 
 Defenses: The character’s Armor Class (AC), Fortitude, Reflex, and Will.
These numbers represent how tough it is to hit the character with a vari-
ety of attacks in combat, serving as the target numbers that opponents
need to achieve to damage the character with an attack.
 Speed: This is the distance (in squares) the character can move with a
normal move action. If the character moves twice instead of moving and
attacking, he or she can move up to twice the listed number in the round.
 Initiative: To decide who goes first in a combat round, each player
makes an initiative check. The player rolls a d20 and adds his or her
character’s initiative modifier. That determines when the character can
act in the round.
 Powers: Powers are a character’s primary attacks and other special abil-
ities usable in combat (and sometimes in other situations as well). Most
powers include an attack (targeting a specific defense) and an effect,
often including damage. Whenever a character uses an attack power, 
the player rolls a d20 and adds the attack bonus. If the result equals or
exceeds the target’s defense, the attack hits. If the attack roll succeeds,
the player usually rolls damage, using the dice and adding the modifiers
shown in this section on the character sheet.
For example, Regdar the fighter (one of the sample characters we pro-
vide in Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition For Dummies) can use his cleave
power to attack with his greatsword (+8 versus Armor Class); if he suc-
ceeds, he deals 1d10+4 damage, and an enemy who’s adjacent to the
fighter takes 4 damage.
One essential element to note about each power is whether the charac-
ter can use it at will, once per encounter, or once per day. 
 Everything else: Show the player where to look on the character sheet
when those sections become pertinent during the game.
80
Part I: Running a Great Game 

Making the Transition from 
the 3rd Edition to the 4th
If a new player has played a previous edition of the D&D game, there’s less for
him or her to learn in terms of the basics of the game. The player may have
some questions about the new rules in the 4th Edition of D&D. You might also
have a group of players who have experience with previous editions and who
are making the transition to the new edition.
Bring returning players up to speed on the following important differences in
the rules in the 4th Edition of the D&D game from previous editions:
 Attacks and defenses: In past editions, some attacks involved attack
rolls against Armor Class, and others forced the target to roll Fortitude,
Reflex, or Will saving throws to avoid the effects. Now, all attacks use
attack rolls against one of four defenses: Armor Class, Fortitude, Reflex,
or Will.
 Actions in combat: Actions are simplified in 4th Edition. Many actions
that used to be standard or move actions are now minor actions.
Standard actions are usually the most interesting things you want to do
on your turn. Move actions are almost always some kind of movement.
Minor actions cover everything else, from opening a door to drinking a
potion. Minor actions also include key powers and class features like
healing word for the cleric and warlord, divine challenge for the paladin,
hunter’s quarry for the ranger, and warlock’s curse for the warlock.
 Powers: Powers are no longer the exclusive province of spellcasters
such as clerics and wizards. All characters have a choice of exciting and
interesting powers that can be used to attack in every round of combat.
Every character also has a mix of at-will, encounter, and daily powers.
 Healing: Characters essentially have four ways to heal damage they’ve
taken in the 4th Edition:
• Second wind: Once per encounter, a character can use a healing
surge. This is a standard action, except for dwarves (who can use
second wind as a minor action).
• Healing word: Clerics and warlords have a power called healing
word. This is a minor action for the leader character, and it lets the
target use a healing surge. Because the leader adds bonus healing
on top of the target’s healing surge value, this is a great deal,
almost like getting two healing surges for the price of one.
81
Chapter 6: Teaching the Game

• Other powers: Some other powers allow healing as well. Some of
them use healing surges, some let one character spend a healing
surge to heal another character (the paladin’s lay on hands, for
example), and some heal without using surges.
• Short rest: Between encounters, if characters spend a few minutes
catching their breath, they can spend as many healing surges as
they want, up to their daily limit, to heal up to as close to full as
they want to be.
 Opportunity attacks: Opportunity attacks are a lot simpler than in 3rd
Edition. When your PC is standing next to a monster, there are two
things you can do that let it take an opportunity attack on your charac-
ter: move, or make a ranged or area attack. The same simple rule applies
to opportunity attacks your character takes against a monster. Most
monsters can’t make opportunity attacks against characters who aren’t
next to them, even if they have long reach. Casting a spell doesn’t pro-
voke opportunity attacks unless it’s a ranged or area spell — a close or
melee spell is safe. No other actions, such as standing up from prone,
pulling something out of a backpack, or stabilizing a dying friend, pro-
voke opportunity attacks. And more important, you never have to look
at a table to figure out whether an action provokes an opportunity
attack or not.
 Critical hits: When you roll a natural 20, you get a critical hit and deal
maximum damage (plus some extra dice if you have a magic weapon).
There’s no confirmation roll and no double damage.
 Saving throws: You don’t roll a saving throw to see whether something
affects you — that’s what your defenses are for. You roll a saving throw
to see whether you can shake off an effect that’s already taken hold.
There are no types of saving throws, and very few modifiers. Whenever
you make a saving throw, you just roll 1d20 and hope for a 10 or better.

Your First Adventure: Kobold Hall
In This Chapter
 Preparing for the sample adventure 
 Adjusting the adventure for your gaming group
 Running the sample dungeon
W
e’re taking all the advice we provide earlier in the book and using it to
show you how to run your very first DUNGEONS & DRAGONS adventure,
using the sample adventure in the Dungeon Master’s Guide as a starting point.
As we walk you through Kobold Hall, we provide plenty of advice and behind-
the-scenes information to make your first experience as Dungeon Master run
as smoothly as possible. This is the good stuff — go ahead and dig in!
This chapter is all about the adventure presented in Chapter 11 of the
Dungeon Master’s Guide, a short excursion into kobold-infested ruins called,
aptly enough, Kobold Hall. This chapter will make more sense to you if you
have the adventure in front of you as you read. You’ll find it on pages 210–219
in the DMG. 
Getting Started with the Adventure
Whenever you prepare to run an adventure for a D&D game session, you should
consider the items discussed in the following sections. You might come to
develop other preparation habits as you become more comfortable in your role
as Dungeon Master and as you become more comfortable with the game, but
the following sections provide a solid approach to DM preparation.
Knowing the players
As we discuss in Chapters 5 and 9, you need to have a sense of the kind of
game the players want to play in. This includes getting a sense of the kind of

characters they like to play, the way they approach the game, the kind of
adventures they prefer, and the style of play they try to emulate. 
Now, for your first adventure, you don’t need to know the players’ wants and
needs for the game inside and out. In fact, you might not have much of an
idea about their views on that at all when you start out. When you do figure
that all out (through candid conversations, observation of play patterns, or
both), it gives you a powerful tool for adventure planning and preparation.
For your first session, you basically just need to know how many players are
coming to the game. The Kobold Hall adventure is designed to challenge a
group of five 1st-level player characters. If you have more or fewer than five
players, you should adjust the encounters so they remain challenging but not
deadly for your group. We give some suggestions about how to do that in the
later section, “Making Changes to the Adventure.”
Knowing your adventure
Never approach your game session cold. That’s just trouble waiting to
happen. It all comes back to being prepared. Whether you’re preparing to run
Kobold Hall, another published adventure, or one you’ve created, make sure
you’ve prepared before the game session starts by following these steps:
1. Read through the adventure so you have a sense of the story and the
pacing, as well as an understanding of the main villain and the encoun-
ters that the player characters will have to deal with. For your first ses-
sion, preparation is easy — just review the adventure in the Dungeon
Master’s Guide.
2. Review the encounters in the adventure and identify the ones your
group is most likely to get to in the course of your next session. Give the
most likely encounters a careful look, making sure you understand the
suggested monster tactics, the monsters’ powers, and the features of the
encounter areas.
For Kobold Hall, it’s a simple job — there are only five encounters. The
characters will get through about one encounter an hour (perhaps fewer
if you and the players are still learning the game). If you’ll be playing for
three hours, look at the first three encounters. 
3. Gather any other materials you’ll need for the adventure, including your
battle grid, miniatures (or other markers to represent the monsters),
and dice. If you use Dungeon Tiles, set out the tiles you’ll need to build
the rooms in the dungeon ahead of time. If you use a dry- or wet-erase
battle grid, you might want to sketch out the first encounter area or two
so that you can get right to the action when you start the game session.

Understanding the adventure format
The format of a published D&D adventure is designed to make your job 
running the adventure as easy as possible. An adventure begins with some
amount of introductory material that sets the stage for the action and explains
how the encounters fit together. In Kobold Hall, that introduction is the first
two pages. Page 210 provides a brief summary of the situation, three hooks
you can use to get the players involved, a paragraph of read-aloud introduc-
tion for the players, a short introduction for the DM, and a note about trea-
sure. Then page 211 shows a map of the whole dungeon.
After the introductory material, the encounters that make up the adventure
appear on separate pages. Short encounters fit on a single page, and longer
ones take up two facing pages. Each encounter entry includes setup informa-
tion, read-aloud text to introduce the players to the encounter, statistics
blocks for the monsters in the encounter, a close-up tactical map of the
encounter area, descriptions of the features of the area, and notes about the
monsters’ preferred tactics in the encounter. The tactical map shows the
positions where the monsters begin the encounter. Pages 212 through 219 of
the Kobold Hall adventure contain these tactical encounter descriptions.
Making Changes to the Adventure
Using a published adventure makes it easy to get ready for a game with a min-
imum of preparation time. It can also be a great starting point for you to craft
85
Chapter 7: Your First Adventure: Kobold Hall

encounters that are better suited to your own group of players than anything
the adventure’s author could create without spending time at your game
table. Making changes to a published adventure might seem daunting — or
maybe even a little presumptuous — but it’s actually an easy way to make the
game that much more fun for everyone. It’ll also help you understand how
encounters are put together.
Making encounters easier or harder
If your group of players has more or fewer than five players, you should
adjust the encounters in a published adventure to account for that difference
in group size. 
There’s an easy guideline for adjusting the difficulty of an encounter to
account for extra or missing players: Find a monster whose level is the same
as the encounter level. For each player more or less than five in your group,
add or remove one of those monsters. It’s a good idea to add soldiers or
brutes first, and take away controllers or skirmishers first. You can also add
or remove traps or hazards, following the same principle.
For example, the first encounter in Kobold Hall (Area 1: Sludge Pit, on page
212 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide) is a level 1 encounter. It consists of five
1st-level monsters, so it’s very easy to adjust for different group sizes:
 Two players: Use one of each kind of kobold.
 Three players: Remove one kobold slinger and one kobold skirmisher.
 Four players: Remove one kobold slinger.
 Six players: Add one kobold skirmisher.
 Seven players: Add one kobold skirmisher and one kobold slinger.
 Eight players: Add two kobold skirmishers and one kobold slinger.
The simple guideline works well for some encounters, but it doesn’t work for
every instance. If you run into trouble, the next approach is to figure out how
many experience points you need to add or subtract from the encounter to
make it an appropriate challenge for your group. You’ll need to reference
pages 56–57 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide to do this.
The basic formula is simple: You want to build an encounter where the total
XP reward is equal to the XP value of a single monster of the encounter’s
level multiplied by the number of characters in the party. 
As an example, look at Area 4: The Big Boss (pages 216–217). This is a level 4
encounter for five player characters (worth a total of 850 XP), but there’s no
level 4 monster in the encounter. It’s as challenging as it is primarily because
of the number of monsters and traps involved. If your group is larger or smaller
86
Part I: Running a Great Game 

than five players, you’ll want to adjust the encounter so that it’s still encounter
level 4 for your group. That means the total XP value of all the monsters (and
the trap) should be about equal to the XP value of a 4th-level monster (175 XP)
times the number of players in your group. Here’s how you might adjust it:
 Two players: Target 175 XP × 2 = 350 XP. Use the rolling boulder trap,
one kobold dragonshield as the “big boss,” and one kobold slinger.
 Three players: Target 175 XP × 3 = 525 XP. You can cut 325 XP by remov-
ing the spiretop drake, one of the kobold dragonshields, and one of the
kobold slingers. 
 Four players: Target 175 XP × 4 = 700 XP. You need to cut about 150 XP.
You can cut one of the kobold slingers (100 XP) and still be in the right
ballpark.
 Six players: Target 175 XP × 6 = 1,050 XP. You need to add 200 XP. Add a
third dragonshield and another slinger.
 Seven players: Target 175 XP × 7 = 1,225 XP. You need 375 XP more than
what’s in the encounter now. Add two dragonshields and a spiretop drake.
 Eight players: Target 175 XP × 8 = 1,400 XP. You’re adding 550 XP to the
mix. At this point, you might decide that the Skull Kickers have a shared
leadership structure with two kobold wyrmpriests as co-chieftains, plus
two more dragonshields and a second rolling boulder trap! 
Solo monsters, like the dragon in area 5 of Kobold Hall, can make these
adjustments tricky, because there are no monsters to remove for a small group.
Depending on the size of your group, you might want to replace the dragon with
a different monster, adjust the monster’s level, or add helper monsters to the
encounter. The dragon encounter is a 3rd-level encounter, so your target XP
value for this encounter is 150 XP (the value of a 3rd-level monster) times the
number of players in your group. Here are some suggestions for that encounter:
 Two players: Target 150 × 2 = 300 XP. Replace the dragon with a guard
drake (level 2 brute, 125 XP) and a kobold slyblade (level 4 lurker, 175
XP), or a rage drake (level 5 brute, 200 XP) and a spiretop drake (level 1
skirmisher, 100 XP).
 Three players: Target 150 × 3 = 450 XP. You could bring the dragon down
two levels because a level 1 solo monster is worth 500 XP. Alternatively,
you could replace it with a different monster or group of monsters. Two
rage drakes (5th-level brutes worth 200 XP each), or perhaps a rage
drake (200 XP), a spitting drake (3rd-level artillery, 150 XP), and a spire-
top drake (1st-level skirmisher, 100 XP), would preserve the draconic
theme of the encounter at a manageable level of difficulty.
 Four players: Target 150 XP × 4 = 600 XP. You could reduce the dragon’s
level by 1, since a level 2 solo monster is worth 625 XP. The dragon
would take a –1 penalty on its attacks and defenses and lose 32 hit
points. (See “Increasing or Decreasing Level” on page 174 of the Dungeon
Master’s Guide.)
87
Chapter 7: Your First Adventure: Kobold Hall

 Six players: Target 150 XP × 6 = 900 XP. You could use a black dragon (level 
4 solo lurker, 875 XP) instead of a white, or add a spitting drake (level 3
artillery, 150 XP). You could also advance the white dragon one level,
giving it a +1 bonus to attacks and defenses and 32 extra hit points.
 Seven players: Target 150 XP × 7 = 1,050 XP. You could use a green dragon
(level 5 solo skirmisher, 1,000 XP) instead of a white; add two spitting
drakes; or advance the white dragon two levels (giving it a +1 damage
bonus in addition to increasing its attacks, defenses, and hit points). You
could also add either of the encounters designed for two players.
 Eight players: Target 150 XP × 8 = 1,200 XP. Add either of the three-
player encounters.
Appealing to player motivations
Besides adjusting encounters to suit the size of your group, another way you
can modify Kobold Hall is to tweak the adventure to suit the motivations of
your players. Player motivations are discussed on pages 8–10 of the Dungeon
Master’s Guide, and page 105 of that book includes some more discussion of
how to appeal to different players. Here are some suggestions for how to
modify Kobold Hall to suit the composition of your group:
 Actors: As written, Kobold Hall doesn’t offer a lot of opportunity for the
interaction encounters where actor players thrive. If you have actors in
your group, it’s worth spending a little more time with the adventure
hooks to let the player characters interact with NPCs in town. Roleplay
the kobolds before and during the combat encounters — the kobolds in
area 3, for example, can taunt the player characters and berate them for
interrupting the skull-skull game. You might also make the dragon talk
before attacking, giving the characters a chance to plead for their lives
and the actor players a chance to shine.
 Explorers: Kobold Hall used to be a walled keep for a minor human lord,
but the adventure’s introduction says that lord’s name and history are
long forgotten. You can engage explorer players by inventing some his-
tory for the place and providing some clues to the background you
invent. Explorers will be intrigued to learn that the altar now dedicated
to Tiamat (in area 2) used to be a shrine to Ioun, and that the stone
coffins hold the remains of a long-lost noble line. What if the players find
some heirloom of the family, spurring them to find any surviving heirs to
the line?
 Instigators: Instigators don’t need much help to enjoy the game, and
Kobold Hall gives them plenty of what they like best — chances to make
things happen. From the sludge pit in area 1 to the rolling boulder in
area 4, the environment is interesting and dangerous enough to keep
instigators happy. 
88
Part I: Running a Great Game 

 Power gamers: Kobold Hall already offers plenty to keep budding power
gamers engaged: tough combat encounters with plentiful rewards. If
your group includes any power gamers, make sure the magic items the
characters find as treasure match up with the desires and specialties of
the characters. You can replace the +1 lifedrinker longsword in the white
dragon’s hoard (in area 5) with whatever type of weapon is most appeal-
ing to a melee-oriented defender or striker character, for example.
 Slayers: Nothing to worry about here — slaying kobolds is all the reward
these players need. Of course, slayers will also enjoy getting to prove
their mettle against a dragon!
 Storytellers: It’s important to help storyteller players understand that
any adventure is both a story in its own right and part of the larger story
of the campaign and its heroes. As with actor players, don’t gloss over
the adventure hooks and quests, which provide much of the story con-
text for the characters’ excursion into Kobold Hall. Storytellers will be
eager to learn why these kobolds seem so well organized and aggressive,
and you should make sure it’s clear that the dragon’s influence is to
blame. Pay attention to the suggestions for further adventures (page 219
in the adventure), and think about how you can tie this adventure in
with the next one you plan to run. Finally, look for ways you can make
the adventure personal for the storytellers in your group, hooking them
in with individual quests that relate to the background they create for
their characters. For example, a friend or relative of one of the charac-
ters might have been injured or captured in a kobold raid on the King’s
Road.
 Thinkers: The tactical situations in the combat encounters of Kobold
Hall should engage the thinkers in your group. You might also add
puzzle elements to one or two areas of the dungeon. For example, the
treasure in area 2 might be hidden in a secret compartment that requires
either solving a riddle or manipulating a physical puzzle to open. 
 Watchers: By definition, a watcher is hard to engage, and it’s important
to remember that it’s okay — watchers have fun because of the com-
pany around the table, not because they’re totally hooked by the game.
Don’t take it personally! Also, make sure that whenever any player comes
up with an unexpected strategy or a cool idea, you reward it and run with
it. That’s the best way to show the watcher that players who are involved
and engaged make the game more fun for everyone at the table.
Transforming the kobolds
Kobold Hall was designed, in part, to show off the variety that exists even
among kobolds, which have always been among the weakest creatures in the
D&D game. The adventure includes statistics for five different kinds of kobolds:
level 1 skirmishers, level 1 artillery (slingers), level 1 minions, level 2 soldiers
89
Chapter 7: Your First Adventure: Kobold Hall

(dragonshields), and the level 3 artillery leader, the wyrmpriest. You have a
lot of variety there, and the traps and drakes in the encounters mix things up
even more, but some players find the waves of kobolds a little repetitive. 
You can inject some more variety into the adventure with some simple mon-
ster substitutions. You could replace a kobold skirmisher in area 1 with three
kruthik hatchlings (level 2 minions), for example. The more Monster Manual
volumes you have available, the more options you have for substitutions.
In theory, you could replace all the kobolds in the adventure with different
monsters, dramatically altering the flavor of the adventure. Goblins could 
fill in for most of the kobolds, with goblin sharpshooters replacing kobold
slingers, goblin warriors standing in for kobold skirmishers, goblin cutters in
place of the kobold minions, hobgoblin soldiers instead of kobold dragon-
shields, and a hobgoblin warcaster serving as the big boss instead of the
wyrmpriest. There are only a few cases where the goblin levels are different
from the kobold levels, and they’re not so different that they’ll make a huge
change to the difficulty of the encounters. You might also decide to replace
the drakes that appear in the adventure, using dire rats or kruthik young
instead of guard drakes and a rat swarm instead of a spiretop drake. 
Expanding the adventure
Another way to add some variety to the adventure and add hooks to engage
your players is to simply add encounters. By simply adding doors, halls, and
rooms to the dungeon map, you can add decision points to make the dungeon
more interesting, and you can add encounters to expand the story you’re
telling with the adventure. If you’re planning a marathon D&D session of eight
to ten hours (hey, it happens!), adding three or four encounters will fill out
the adventure to fit the time you have. Adding that many encounters will also
expand the adventure enough that characters who complete the whole thing
will probably reach 2nd level.
The easiest places in the dungeon to add rooms are south of areas 2 and 3, and
north of area 3. The map shown in Figure 7-1 provides one way to add two
encounter areas to the original map of Kobold Hall, adding a couple of decision
points. A simple alternative, suggested in the original adventure, is to expand
the dungeon with more tunnels and caves below the dragon’s lair, but that
means the dungeon remains very linear, offering no real choices to the players.
Chapter 23 provides ten examples of heroic-tier encounters that you can 
use to expand this adventure. The map in Figure 7-1 incorporates two of
those encounters — Hobgoblin Guards (a level 3 encounter) and Goblin Lair
(a level 1 encounter). It’s up to you to decide how the goblins and kobolds
get along: Are they working together under the dragon’s leadership? Are the
goblins trying to establish a lair here and drive the kobolds out? Explore
some possibilities and see where your imagination takes you.

Running the Adventure
Kobold Hall is a simple adventure without much in the way of plot or 
decision-making, but it’s a great introduction to the game for new players —
or players who are new to 4th Edition. The rest of this chapter walks you
through what you need to do to run the adventure for your players.

It’s just a game
Remember to relax and have fun. We can’t
stress this enough — DUNGEONS & DRAGONS is a
game. It’s a fun game. You might not get every-
thing right, but you can’t get it wrong, either.
Play to the best of your ability and the players’
abilities, and don’t worry if you don’t get all the
game rules quite right the first time out. You have
our permission to make mistakes. (As if you even
need it!) So what are you waiting for? Get your
game group together and start having fun!

Grounding the characters
As the players are creating their characters, refer to the section “Involving
the Players” on pages 208 and 209 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide. For each
character, find the character’s race and class in that section and talk with the
player about his or her place in the home base of Fallcrest. 
For example, Amy is creating an eladrin wizard named Meriele. You might
suggest that she traveled to Fallcrest for one of two reasons: to study with
Nimozaran or to look into the state of her ancestral home in the Moon Hills.
Maybe she came for both reasons, or one reason is just a pretext and the
other is her true motivation: She could easily have found a wizard tutor
among her own people, but seeking Nimozaran also gives her a convenient
excuse to see whether her family’s tales of owning land in the Moon Hills
have any truth to them.
Meanwhile, Carter is creating a dragonborn warlord named Balarash. Looking
at the dragonborn and the warlord entries, you see a name in common —
House Azaer, the small, tiefling-owned trading company in town. Discussing it
with Carter, you agree that Balarash has been working as a caravan guard for
House Azaer, though he’s seeking more fame and glory than that job is likely
to provide. 
Hooking the characters
When the characters are ready to go, it’s time to start the adventure. Page
210 in the Dungeon Master’s Guide provides three hooks you can use to draw
the characters into the action going on at Kobold Hall. One hook might be
enough to bring the whole group on board, particularly if it’s a close-knit
group. The “Kobold Bounty” hook is a straightforward hook for characters
who are looking for adventure — the Lord Warden makes a public announce-
ment of a bounty on kobolds, and the characters just have to claim it. 
If you’ve grounded the characters in the town already, it’s easy to add hooks
that appeal to specific characters (and their players). Perhaps the charac-
ters do hear about the kobold bounty. But Meriele also hears Nimozaran’s
concerns about how well the kobolds seem to be organized (the “Terrible
Secret” hook). And it turns out that Balarash was guarding the caravan from
Winterhaven when kobolds attacked it and stole Teldorthan’s dragon hide, 
so he has a good reason to try to get the dwarf armorer’s stolen goods back
(the “Dragon Hide” hook). Just like that, the group has three good reasons to
go to Kobold Hall.
92
Part I: Running a Great Game 

It’s okay to gloss over the interactions that lead to these hooks. Just make
sure that the players have the chance to ask any questions they have, so you
can move things along to get to the action. You can find more information about
Teldorthan and his stolen dragon hide on page 204 of the Dungeon Master’s
Guide, more about Nimozaran on page 204 (Septarch’s Tower), and more
about the Lord Warden, Faren Markelhay, on page 201 (Moonstone Keep).
Getting to the action
Now it’s time for the main event — the characters’ excursion into Kobold
Hall. Start by giving each player a moment to introduce his or her character
to the other players, telling them the character’s name, race, and class, and 
a brief description of what the other characters see when they look at the
character. Then read the “Players’ Introduction” on page 210 of the Dungeon
Master’s Guide. That read-aloud text brings the characters through a quick
journey to the ruined manor and right up to a trapdoor leading to the dun-
geon. Next, ask the players what they want their characters to do.
The most straightforward thing they can do is open the trapdoor and head
down the stairs to area 1. Here are a few other things they might try, with
notes you can use to help narrate the action. If a player wants his or her char-
acter to try something different, go for it! Listen to what the character wants
to do and then decide how best to adjudicate the action.
Examine the Trapdoor: Any characters that want to examine the trapdoor —
perhaps looking for signs of passage, searching for a hint that it’s trapped, or
listening for signs of life below — should make a Perception check. Regardless
of the results of the check, you can describe the trapdoor in a little more
detail — it’s old and worn, made of wood bound together with iron bars, with
a heavy iron ring to lift it. If a character gets a 15 or better on a Perception
check, give more information relevant to whatever the character’s looking for:
 There are some footprints visible around the trapdoor, and enough
scuffs and smears appear around the edge of it to suggest that it sees a
fair amount of use. The footprints are small, animal-like prints with three
clawed toes.
 There’s no sign that the trapdoor is trapped.
 There’s no sound behind the trapdoor.
Make Preparations: Characters might want to light torches, draw weapons,
or otherwise get ready to descend into a dungeon. Listen to what the players
describe their characters doing and take note of any significant preparations
that could affect later encounters. 
93
Chapter 7: Your First Adventure: Kobold Hall

Open the Trapdoor: Any character can pull the trapdoor open without making
a check. You might want to tell the players that it opens silently on well-oiled
hinges, or that it creaks open loudly. Behind the trapdoor, the characters see
stairs leading down into the darkness, with only a hint of an eerie green glow
coming from somewhere inside.
Area 1: Sludge Pit
As soon as the characters open the trapdoor, it’s time to start laying down a
tactical map. (See Chapter 10 for advice about using tactical maps.) Start
with the stairs and perhaps the 10 feet of hallway beyond. If you’re using D&D
Dungeon Tiles, you can put down a single 2x4 tile with stairs and a landing.
Ask the players to position their miniatures on the stairs, showing you the
order in which they make their way down.
Once the first characters start down the stairs, you can show the players 
the rest of the room and read them the read-aloud text at the start of the
encounter. The kobold’s shouted warning, “Intrudersss!” is a cue that combat
is beginning, so you can go straight from read-aloud text to initiative rolls.
Roll initiative once for the kobold skirmishers and a second time for the
kobold slingers, record those numbers, and ask the players for their charac-
ters’ initiative results as well. Then combat begins, with everyone acting in
initiative order.
Using the Pit: Although the adventure text describes what happens when 
PCs fall into the pit, it’s far more likely that kobolds will end up down there,
caught in the goo. The kobolds don’t have powers that can push or slide
characters over the edge, and their low Strength scores mean they’re not
very good at using the bull rush action (see page 287 in the Player’s Handbook).
Player characters, on the other hand, have a wide selection of powers to
move enemies around the battlefield, from the wizard’s at-will thunder wave
and the fighter’s at-will tide of iron to the warlock’s nasty 1st-level daily power,
curse of the dark dream. The pit has the same effects on the kobolds as it
does on PCs. Remember that characters and monsters can make a saving
throw to avoid falling into the pit when a push or slide would otherwise send
them tumbling. 
Shifty Kobolds: Kobolds have a special racial ability to shift as a minor
action. This means, among other things, that a kobold can shift (for example,
to move next to a character), attack an adjacent enemy, and then shift again
(so it doesn’t end its turn next to a character). A kobold can also attack, shift
away, and then move farther away from its target, without provoking oppor-
tunity attacks. Bear these two things in mind as you run the kobolds:
94
Part I: Running a Great Game 

 Player characters aren’t shifty. It’s easy for players, especially new play-
ers (or players who are used to 3rd Edition rules), to see a kobold’s shift
as a minor action and assume that they can do the same, or forget that a
shift normally requires a move action. Watch out for characters imitating
the kobolds, and emphasize that the kobolds are using a special power
that breaks the normal rules.
 Kobolds aren’t geniuses. Let a player character fighter feel cool and
special because a marked kobold tried to shift away from him or her,
provoking an immediate attack because of the fighter’s combat chal-
lenge class feature. Let the kobolds make this mistake once, but after
that they should probably wise up around the fighter. 
The Portcullis: For the characters to get deeper into the dungeon, they have
to get past the portcullis on the east wall. If one of the characters is a halfling,
he or she can slip through the portcullis as the kobolds do and pull the lever
on the other side to open the gate. Otherwise, a character needs to make a
successful Strength check (DC 15) to force the portcullis up. In the heat of
battle, make the players roll checks if their characters try to lift the portcullis.
When the fight is over, though, it’s safe to assume that the characters will get
the portcullis open through repeated tries. 
Between Encounters: After the characters have defeated the kobolds, let the
players know that you’ll assume the characters take a short rest after every
encounter unless they tell you otherwise. A short rest lets them spend heal-
ing surges and regain any encounter powers they spent during the encounter,
so they can start the next encounter more or less fresh. 
After the characters defeat the kobolds, take their short rest, and get the
portcullis open, they can take the narrow staircase down to area 2.
Area 2: The Tomb
Once again, start the encounter by having the players arrange their minia-
tures or otherwise show you how they’re going down the stairs — who’s in
front, and who’s bringing up the rear. Because the staircase is only 5 feet
wide, they have to go down these stairs in single file. (When the encounter
begins, remember and remind the players that a character can move through
an ally’s square, so they can move past each other on the stairs.) After
they’re arranged on the stairs, read the read-aloud text to start the encounter.
Using Perception: At the start of the encounter, ask the players what their
characters’ passive Perception scores are and make a note of the numbers.
(A character’s passive Perception is equal to 10 + the character’s Perception
check bonus. It’s as if the character rolled a 10 on a Perception check.)
95
Chapter 7: Your First Adventure: Kobold Hall

Any character with a passive Perception of 20 or higher notices that there’s
some kind of mechanism in the helms set in the niches. A character with a
passive Perception of 25 or higher (unlikely at 1st level) spots the trigger
stone nearest the bottom of the stairs, and that character can see other trig-
ger stones as he or she moves around the room. 
Characters can also attempt Perception checks to find the trigger stones, par-
ticularly once they know there’s a trap in the room. It’s a standard action to
look around for a trigger stone and make a Perception check. If the player
rolls a 25 or better, you can point out the locations of any trigger stones in
sight.
Keeping Track of the Trap: The trickiest thing about running this encounter
is keeping track of where the trigger stones are. Keep the map in front of you
as characters move around the room, and pay particular attention when they
cross in front of the alcoves containing the trapped suits of armor. 
On the kobolds’ turn, keep an eye on the map as well. The kobolds shouldn’t
enter squares that trigger the traps. Have them try to end their turn in a
square next to trigger stones, so that characters who move up to attack them
will trigger the trap. 
96
Part I: Running a Great Game 

Resolving Creative Solutions: Inevitably, players will come up with creative
solutions for dealing with the trap beyond the countermeasures listed in the
book. Keep an open mind and try to reward clever thinking with good results.
For example, characters might try to block the darts as they fire out from the
trap, perhaps by holding a shield in front of the visor or throwing a cloak
over the armor. You might decide that characters get cover against the trap’s
attack (a –2 penalty on the attack). Could a character turn the armor so the
darts fire into the alcove, or turn the helmet so the darts can’t go out the
visor? You might ask the character to make one or two successful DC 20
Strength checks, sort of like a very simple skill challenge. If you can remain
flexible and think on your feet, you’ll go a long way toward teaching your
players that D&D is a game about creative thinking and problem solving,
encouraging them to try anything they can think of!
Describing the Altar: Tiamat’s symbol, a star shape formed from five talons
or teeth, appears on page 163 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide. If the players
want their characters to examine the altar, you can describe that symbol.
They could also attempt Religion checks (DC 15 to 25) to learn more about
the doctrine of Tiamat, which is described on the same page.
Area 3: Skull-Skull!
Once again, have the players arrange their miniatures on the stairs before
you read them the read-aloud text. It can be fun to see how quickly your play-
ers figure out what’s going on in this room. If they need a hint, angry kobolds
might scream, “Big hairies interrupt our skull-skull game!” in their high-
pitched voices. 
Using the Pit: Turnabout, they say, is fair play. In area 1, the kobolds didn’t
have any way to push characters into the sludge pit. Here, the skull-skull
stone can accomplish that while the kobolds keep a safe distance from the
pit. The kobolds’ goal is to keep the characters from getting through the
door, and the pit can help them accomplish that goal.
Using Minions: This encounter illustrates a useful principle for designing
encounters that include minions: Don’t show all the minions to the player
characters at once. This encounter begins with two minions up on the plat-
forms in view of the characters, and two others behind the platforms. The
two visible minions are also far enough apart that a single area attack is
unlikely to affect them both. This arrangement covers the greatest weakness
of minion monsters, which is their susceptibility to area attacks. 
97
Chapter 7: Your First Adventure: Kobold Hall

Area 4: The Big Boss
The start of this encounter assumes that the kobolds in this room heard the
sounds of fighting from area 3, just down the hall, and are ready for the char-
acters’ arrival. The kobolds in this room didn’t run to join the fight in the hall
because their primary duty is to protect the chieftain. Here, they have a trap
they can turn against the intruders to help keep their wyrmpriest safe.
Using the Boulder: The boulder rolls around the room at a speed of 8, which
means it can actually move 16 squares each round, because it’s not taking any
other actions except opportunity actions to attack characters it rolls over. 
The kobold slingers prefer to use their glue shot against characters who are
in the path of the boulder. 
Marking Characters: In another example of turnabout being fair play, the
kobold dragonshields can mark player characters, just as paladins and fight-
ers can mark monsters. The kobolds use this ability in the same way PC
defenders do — they mark opponents that might otherwise attack the wyrm-
priest. A simple mark, without the additional threat of a paladin’s divine chal-
lenge or a fighter’s combat challenge, might not be enough to keep characters
from attacking the wyrmpriest, but it’s much like giving the wyrmpriest a
defense bonus. 
Area 5: The True Threat
The map for this encounter doesn’t quite agree with the read-aloud text, and
we recommend that you go with the text in this case — give the players a
sense that their characters are descending through natural caverns stretch-
ing deep below Kobold Hall. 
Spotting the Dragon: Roll a Stealth check for Szartharaxx (using his Dexterity
check, 1d20 + 1) and compare the result with the characters’ passive
Perception checks rather than asking them to roll Perception checks to begin
the encounter. Any character whose passive Perception is lower than the
dragon’s Stealth check is surprised at the start of the encounter.
Troubleshooting: The trickiest thing about this encounter is the possibility
that the dragon might kill one or more characters. If the characters are worn
thin after fighting the kobolds in area 4, you can encourage them to take an
extended rest before they venture down into the dragon’s caves. If they get
98
Part I: Running a Great Game 

into a fight with the dragon, make sure the players realize that their charac-
ters can run away. Szartharaxx is proud and won’t follow them out of the
cave, giving the characters the chance to escape, recover from the fight, and
perhaps return better prepared.
Roleplaying the Dragon: Szartharaxx is a brutal opponent, but he’s also rea-
sonably intelligent. On his turn in combat, let the dragon talk with the charac-
ters. He could just taunt them — playing with his food, perhaps — or he
could boast about some of the information that appears in the “Setup” sec-
tion of the encounter (how he ate the rival kobold chieftains and collects trib-
ute from the Skull Kickers, for example). If you’re planning ahead, he could
drop some hints that lead the characters to whatever adventure you plan to
run next. 
Ham it up! Find a voice you can do easily that suggests a dragon — it could
be a fierce growl, a menacing hiss, or a low whisper. What word might a
dragon use to refer to player characters? Bipeds? Mammals? Meat?
Dragons of myth and fantasy fiction are memorable opponents, and
Szartharaxx should be the same. Make sure the characters know his name 
(at least how to pronounce it — SAR-tha-rax), and give them something to
remember him by. Of course, a fight to the edge of death is usually pretty
memorable, but it’ll be even more so if you play the dragon as more than just
his combat statistics.
Doling out the treasure from Kobold Hall
Page 126 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide shows ten treasure parcels that repre-
sent the total amount of treasure a party of five 1st-level characters should
acquire before they reach 2nd level. The Kobold Hall adventure gives out five
of those ten parcels:
 A bag containing 60 gp in area 2. This is parcel 9.
 Area 3 contains scattered treasure worth a total of 200 gp, which is
parcel 5.
 A +1 staff of the war mage (a level 3 magic item) in area 4. This is 
parcel 3.
 The dragon’s treasure in area 5, including 100 gp, a pearl worth 20 gp,
and a +1 lifedrinker longsword (a level 5 magic item). The monetary trea-
sure is parcel 7 or 8, and the sword is parcel 1.
99
Chapter 7: Your First Adventure: Kobold Hall

If you use either of the story hooks to draw the characters in to the adven-
ture, they’ll earn more treasure as quest rewards:
 If you use the Dragon Hide hook for the adventure, Teldorthan’s reward
of 200 gp is parcel 6 plus an extra 20 gp (or half of parcel 10).
 If you use the Kobold Bounty hook, the total reward (assuming the
characters kill all the kobolds) is 290 gp. That’s parcel 6 plus parcel 7 
or 8, but it comes up 10 gp short.
If you use both hooks, you should change the promised reward to make use
of different treasure parcels. It would be perfectly reasonable for Teldorthan
to promise a magic item (parcel 2 or 4) instead of monetary treasure if char-
acters complete his quest, and Nimozaran could also give a magic item reward. 
Depending on how many quests you gave the characters to hook them in to
the adventure, they will have completed six to eight encounters’ worth of XP.
If they complete all three quests, they’ll reach 2nd level, and in that case you
should make sure they’ve acquired all ten treasure parcels for 1st level.

W
hether you’ve just run your first successful D&D game or you’ve been
DMing for a while, it’s time to start thinking about doing this DMing
thing on a regular basis. Just as millions of people enjoy a regular Friday
night poker game, bowling league, or movie night, most D&D players partici-
pate in an ongoing D&D game. Maintaining a game group that meets on a reg-
ular basis (once a week, once every two weeks, once a month, or whatever
works for you) is the next natural step for a Dungeon Master.
Setting up a regularly recurring game has a lot of advantages:
 The game has a chance to grow. Most importantly, a recurring game
gives you the opportunity to evolve the D&D game into a more reward-
ing experience than you can achieve with a single game session. You can
tackle extended adventures that require multiple game sessions to finish
and add broad storylines to the game, and the players can keep their
characters and grow them over time by gaining experience points,
acquiring magic items, and building their characters’ personalities and
backstories.
 You’ve got players right where you want ’em. You don’t have to go
searching for players every time you want to play D&D — you can stick
with the players you already have. 
 Everyone knows the niceties. You can easily establish some basic game
etiquette and table manners for the game because the players are all reg-
ulars and they know how things are supposed to go. 

Choosing the Right Format
You can take a lot of different approaches to running a regular D&D game.
Although most experienced D&D players will tell you that the “best” game is
a long-running campaign where they’ve kept the same characters for years
and the DM hand-builds a meticulously detailed world to explore, the truth is
that sort of complicated commitment isn’t the right game for everybody. You
might expect to play with the same group only for a couple months (over a
summer break, for example), so what would be the point of trying to build a
game world that would take years to explore? Sometimes the best game is
one you run only for a few sessions.
When you’re deciding how to build an ongoing D&D game, ask yourself these
questions: Do you want the characters to continue from session to session?
Do you want the adventure to continue from session to session? Do you want
the game to continue from adventure to adventure? Take a look at Table 8-1.
The answers to these questions can help you settle on a good model or
format for your game: the standalone session, the dungeon-of-the-week, the
one-shot campaign, or the continuing campaign (each of which we explain in
the coming sections).

The standalone session
At the most basic level, an ongoing D&D game consists of bringing back the
same players for a game on some sort of regular basis. Nothing else must con-
tinue from session to session — and with the standalone session, each time
the group plays, it’s a new adventure featuring new characters.
104
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

The standalone session has some important advantages:
 It’s simple. Because nothing continues to the next session, you have no
record-keeping to speak of. 
 It gives you the opportunity to try very different styles or scenarios
each time you play. One week the players can be barbarians and out-
casts hunting monsters in the arctic wastes, and the next week they can
be urbane swashbucklers and nobles solving a murder mystery in a
great medieval city. You can explore a tremendous variety of D&D adven-
tures this way.
 It’s a great format for giving players the chance to try their hands at
being the Dungeon Master. It’s only one game session, after all.
The standalone session has three disadvantages. You have to make up or find
new adventure material each time you play. You can’t try out very long or
involved adventures unless you have a lot of time available for the game ses-
sion. The players don’t have an opportunity to become familiar with their
characters or develop them over time.
Making up a new character takes time, and you want to maximize the playing
time you get out of every game session. It’s a good idea to tell the players a
day or two ahead of time what kind of characters they’ll need to bring for the
next game, and you should ask them to show up ready to play. At a minimum,
the players need to know what level to give to their characters.
Run your D&D game as a series of standalone sessions if . . .
 Your D&D game sessions are infrequent or hard to schedule.
 The players don’t invest in their characters and like making up new
characters more than continuing to play old ones.
 The membership of your game group changes frequently.
The dungeon-of-the-week adventure
The dungeon-of-the-week adventure format resembles the standalone session,
except that the players keep the same characters from session to session. As
with the standalone session, you save yourself the trouble of coming up with
broad storylines or campaign details, and the record-keeping is minimal, so
this is a fairly easy game format for the Dungeon Master to run. However, the
players have the chance to become familiar with their characters and
advance them over time. It’s also easy to move from this model into a “real”
campaign if the group wants to do so later on.
105
Chapter 8: Running an Ongoing Game

Run your D&D game as a dungeon-of-the-week adventure if . . .
 Your D&D game sessions are infrequent or hard to schedule.
 The players like advancing existing characters more than trying out new
ones.
 The players view continuing story elements as a distraction and like to
play a style of game that’s fast and light.
The one-shot campaign
The one-shot campaign is one long adventure that spans many game sessions
because exploring a deep dungeon isn’t the work of just one evening. A D&D
group can tackle about one encounter in an hour of gaming, so any adventure
that features more than three to five distinct encounters might require multi-
ple sessions to complete, depending on how long your session lasts. Most
Dungeon Masters routinely run extended adventures that stretch across
months of real time, tackling a few rooms in a big dungeon every week until
the player characters have explored the whole thing. 
Your group might need to play once or twice a week for months to get
through an epic adventure, but when the adventure is finished, it’s done. You
put away the dungeon, the players retire the characters, and the next time
you begin a D&D game, you can start with a party of brand-new characters
tackling a brand-new dungeon. 
The big advantage of the one-shot campaign is that you tailor the scope of
your ongoing game to the adventure material and play time you have avail-
able. If you get an adventure from Dungeon magazine (online at D&D Insider)
or buy a ready-to-play D&D adventure from your game store, you have every-
thing you need to run a game lasting weeks or months — you don’t need to
scramble each week to come up with something to throw in front of the play-
ers. The players have lots of time to become familiar with their characters
and usually get to advance them at least a few levels over the course of the
game.
Run your D&D game as a one-shot campaign if . . .
 You have one good adventure to run, and you expect it will take at least
a few game sessions to play it out.
 You have a real-world time constraint to consider, such as a school year,
a summer break, or a military deployment.
 You want to present some story elements and character advancement
but don’t want to track an evolving storyline and campaign history over
multiple adventures.
106
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

The continuing campaign
Many D&D players feel that the game is at its very best when they get to keep
their same characters week after week. Over time, the players get to know
their characters and watch them grow in power, experience, and heroic repu-
tation. The adventuring party moves from one dungeon or adventure to the
next, which often presents an entirely new threat unrelated to the challenge
of the previous adventure. When you string two (or more) adventures
together for the same group of characters, it’s a continuing campaign. The
players keep their characters, and you slowly build up a history of dungeons
plundered and monsters defeated by the heroes.
Campaigns invest the players in your D&D world and allow for the rewarding
experience of growing a character over time. This format is the best for enter-
taining players who like to roleplay their characters, and it gives you your
best opportunity to engage in the rewarding job of world-building — making
up your own world to serve as the setting for your D&D games. However, it
requires a modest amount of record-keeping and work on your part to keep a
campaign running smoothly for adventure after adventure.
Run your D&D game as a continuing campaign if . . .
 You have several adventures you’d like to run for your gaming group.
 You enjoy the process of world-building and want to show off your 
creativity.
 The players enjoy roleplaying and exploring their characters in depth.
 The membership of your game group tends to remain stable over time.
107
Chapter 8: Running an Ongoing Game

Building a Basic Campaign
Although you can run standalone sessions or present dungeon-of-the-week
adventures indefinitely, most Dungeon Masters eventually move on to pre-
senting an ongoing campaign. A campaign is simply a string of adventures in
which the same cast of player characters takes part. At the most basic level,
the campaign is nothing more than the sequence in which you throw unre-
lated adventures at the same group of player characters. At the deep end, a
campaign is a sprawling world populated with memorable NPCs, deadly vil-
lains, and riveting storylines that keep the players coming back for years.
Don’t let this intimidate you; we’re starting at the shallow end.
Creating the home base
One key component of a basic campaign is some sort of home base — a set-
ting and collection of familiar characters to serve as the framing device for
your D&D game. The home base gives the player characters roots in your
game world. It’s a place for the player characters to care about, a place they
want to protect. When the PCs need to trade loot for useful gear, the home
base is where they go. When the PCs need to get advice or guidance about
how to solve a problem, some NPC at the home base is the person they’ll ask.
And when the PCs begin to explore the world outside the dungeon, the home
base is where they start.
Over time, you can use the home base as a springboard for designing your
own D&D world. But for starters, a good home base needs only NPCs, com-
merce, and story.
Home base NPCs
Unless the players like to roleplay complete misfits, every character in the
party implies a network of NPC patrons, advisers, friends, and rivals. For
example, if one of the player characters is a cleric of Erathis, it’s natural to
ask where other devotees of Erathis might be found. If another player charac-
ter is a wizard, it’s good to know whether the home base has any kind of orga-
nized wizards’ guild or someone who might serve as a mentor and tutor.
When you populate the home base, think about including NPCs who fill the
following roles:
 An authority figure, such as a mayor or lord, who can ask the PCs to
help out the town by solving problems (and thus providing adventure
opportunities)
 A sage, a counselor, or an adviser who can answer questions for the PCs
108
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

 A merchant who can buy loot and sell items and equipment the PCs are
interested in
 A healer who can use rituals to fix injuries or curses that the PCs can’t
handle with their own rituals
 Innkeepers, bartenders, and other common folk as needed to make the
home base feel like, well, home
Commerce
The player characters need access to people who will give them gold in
exchange for valuables they recover from monster lairs. The PCs also need a
place to commission rituals they can’t do themselves and buy useful magic
items such as potions, scrolls, and wands.
Give some thought to how you want to handle magic items in your campaign.
Can the characters sell items they don’t want at the home base? Can they buy
items from someone in town? Or do they have to rely on rituals to enchant
and disenchant items on their own? 
The home base should have most (if not all) of the following services and
goods available:
 A temple or similar place where the PCs can obtain healing rituals (espe-
cially important for low-level characters who don’t yet have access to
the rituals needed to fix problems such as disease, curses, and death)
 An armorer’s and weaponmaker’s shop, selling most common weapons
and armor
 A dealer in unusual adventuring gear (sunrods, lock picks, and other
dungeoneering supplies) and minor magical items, such as potions or
ritual scrolls
 A place to meet potential NPC contacts, hirelings, or allies
Story
The home base should be a distinct locale with its own memorable features,
setting, and history. You don’t need a lot of this at first; these elements can
grow over time. Just add a detail or two each time the player characters
return to their home base. As the players discover more about what’s going
on in and around the home base, you’ll be surprised at how they begin to
identify with the place their characters view as home. Important story ques-
tions to address include
 Where are the nearest dungeons, ruins, or monster lairs? How do the
locals view these places?
 What does the place look like? Is it a mining town in the hills? A 
half-forgotten seaport on a fog-shrouded coast? A frontier outpost 
surrounded by vast forests?
109
Chapter 8: Running an Ongoing Game

 What do the residents do to feed themselves? To make money?
 Who’s in charge?
 Who keeps order in the town?
 Are there any potential villains or opponents living in or near the town
that the PCs will need to deal with?
Linking adventures together
A vital step in creating an ongoing campaign is to provide a link from one
adventure to the next. For example, the player characters defeat the orc
warchief of the Stonemarch and drive away the orcs that had been raiding
Winterhaven. For your next adventure, you have a vampire-hunting expedi-
tion in the crypts beneath the dwarven halls of Hammerfast. How do you tie
these adventures together into a continuing story?
110
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 
Getting the players to help
Keeping track of all this stuff can get compli-
cated. Ask the players to help you with the
details, so that you can focus on presenting the
adventure instead of note-keeping. Here are
some jobs you can divvy out to the players:
 Treasure recorder: This player writes down
every bit of loot the player characters
recover, where they got it, which character
is carrying it, and what the party ultimately
does with it. 
 Journal keeper: This player records the sig-
nificant events and encounters of the
evening’s game session, including which
NPCs the player characters meet, which
monsters they fight, and any potential clues
they discover. 
 Initiative organizer: This player maintains
the initiative order in combat. (This isn’t
really record-keeping, but having a player
take over this job frees up the DM to con-
centrate on creating an exciting battle.)
Giving out these sorts of jobs to the players
helps take some of the burden off your shoul-
ders and also gives the players something else
to help them stay focused on the game and
invested in what’s going on. At the end of the
game session, ask the players helping you to
give you a copy of their notes or to write them
up at greater length and send them to you in the
next day or so. By reviewing the party’s journal,
you might spot mistakes you made in present-
ing the adventure or vital clues the player char-
acters missed, or you might find opportunities
to improve the adventure by throwing the play-
ers a twist they don’t expect.
The Internet is a great tool for tracking and
sharing your group’s journal and records. D&D
Insider provides tools you can use to keep notes
on your campaign and share records among
your players. Alternatively, simply having the
player who keeps the campaign journal post
those notes on a blog makes them readily
accessible to you and the other players.

The short answer is that you don’t have to. After the player characters defeat
the warchief of the Stonemarch, they return to their home base. You might
start your next session like this:
You spend a few days resting and recuperating in Fallcrest, spending a bit 
of your hard-won treasure. You can do any shopping you want to do, or
enchant magic items of your level or lower. When you’ve been back about
three days, a dwarf messenger finds you and presents you with a letter from
the High Master of Hammerfast, a strong and wealthy town to the east.
The letter says that the High Master has heard of your success against the
orcs, and she requests you to come to Hammerfast on urgent business.
Something about an undead problem. What do you want to do?
Do you see what happened there? You dropped the hook for the next adven-
ture right in the players’ laps. This technique might seem a little heavy
handed, but most D&D players understand that you’re just trying to get their
characters to the adventure, and they’ll forgive you for being so transparent
about it.
When you’ve gotten the hang of starting the next adventure after the current
one ends, you can start working on some more elegant transitions. Sometimes
you should allow the players to choose between adventures — in the preced-
ing example, the player characters might receive a summons from the High
Master of Hammerfast at the same time that they’re studying an old treasure
map they found in the warchief’s loot. Which adventure hook they follow is
up to the players. Giving the players some choice over what their characters
do next helps to build the illusion of a three-dimensional, living world that is
waiting for the characters to make up their minds. Of course, you need to
have at least two adventures ready to run when you offer the players the
choice of which to play next.
You’ll find that it’s useful to sow the seeds of future adventures by working
foreshadowing elements into the current adventure. In the earlier example,
you should make a point of telling the players about the treasure map among
the warchief’s possessions when they find it so that you don’t have to go
back later and say, “Oh, and you found a treasure map, and followed it, and
here you are.” If you want to try your hand at creating encounters or modify-
ing an adventure, you could add an encounter in the orc warchief adventure
that foreshadows the vampire adventure coming next. For example, you
could create an encounter with a traveling dwarf merchant who turns out to
be a vampire during the course of the adventure against the warchief and his
minions. When the player characters defeat the vampire and examine her
possessions, they find gold coins stamped with the seal of the town of
Hammerfast. Later on, when the heroes receive the message from the High
Master, the players already expect that the adventure in Hammerfast might
involve vampires.
111
Chapter 8: Running an Ongoing Game

Outlining a campaign arc
Like any good story, a campaign needs a beginning, a middle, and an end. You
don’t need to plan out every adventure the characters will have over the
course of 30 levels, but sketching out a campaign arc is still a good idea. If
you have at least a basic outline of what you want to accomplish over the
course of the campaign, you’ll have an easier time planning adventures as
you go and tying those adventures together.
A good way to think about a campaign arc is in terms of an overarching
theme or story. The story could be a struggle against a villain who grows in
power alongside the player characters, or a long-term quest against increas-
ingly powerful minions and servants of an epic threat like a demon prince or
primordial. A campaign arc built around a theme might feature a lot of adven-
tures involving particular types of creatures, such as aberrant monsters or
dragons. 
The simplest way to create a campaign arc is to select published adventures
that suit your theme and arrange them in order from lowest-level to highest.
You can fill in the gaps with adventures you create yourself, with published
adventures that you alter to fit with the campaign theme, or with adventures
that have nothing to do with the theme at all. 
Next, think about story elements you can use to link the adventures together.
That could be as simple as making the characters members of an organiza-
tion dedicated to ridding the world of evil dragons, or bringing them into con-
flict with a group that reveres evil dragons. For a richer story, you could
weave several different groups with different (sometimes conflicting) goals
around the central theme of the campaign. 
For example, say you want to build a campaign arc that brings the player
characters into conflict with various cultists and minions of the demon
prince Orcus over the course of their careers, culminating in a climactic
battle with the demon prince himself when they’re 30th level. A simple story
explanation for this ongoing quest could be that the characters are all mem-
bers of a crusading order of knights dedicated Pelor or Bahamut, who are
opposed to Orcus in principle. The characters share a common goal and
motivation, and that can be enough to drive the campaign.
Alternatively, the characters might come at the campaign from a number of
different perspectives. Perhaps the cleric and the fighter are devoted to Pelor
and seek to obliterate Orcus’s evil from the world. But say the paladin serves
the Raven Queen, who opposes Orcus because the demon prince seeks to
usurp her control over death. The wizard, meanwhile, has a mysterious
mentor who sends her on quests opposing Orcus for reasons that aren’t quite
clear — until later in the campaign, when the players learn that this mysteri-
ous mentor is actually an evil lich who worships Vecna! 
112
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

By placing the characters in the context of organizations, religions, and rela-
tionships, you add story elements to your campaign arc that might suggest
adventure ideas or minor quests along the way. The cleric’s personal devo-
tion to Pelor is sufficient motivation for early in the campaign, but at some
later point you might want to involve NPC servants of Pelor who either sup-
port the cleric or take issue with his methods and become antagonists. The
wizard’s evil mentor could provide a significant subplot that actually dis-
tracts the characters from fighting Orcus for a while around the middle of the
campaign. 
Fundamentally, sketching out a campaign arc is about creating story ele-
ments and starting to brainstorm how they fit together. You’ll figure out the
details as the campaign progresses and as new ideas occur to you. But
sketching out the basics ahead of time helps you move the story on toward
the events you have in mind.
Using the Sample Base: Fallcrest
To help you get started, the Dungeon Master’s Guide provides an example of a
typical home base — a human settlement called Fallcrest that’s located near
a couple of good dungeons for the PCs to explore. Fallcrest is a small town
that can serve as the home base for a group of beginning player characters.
113
Chapter 8: Running an Ongoing Game
Taking a cue from your TV
An ongoing D&D campaign has a lot in common
with TV series such as Star Trek or Buffy the
Vampire Slayer. You have a continuous cast of
player characters who are like the stars of the
show, and each adventure is like an episode of
the series. You might have a recurring villain or
threat who appears every now and then. And
your D&D game should be about the player
characters in the same way that a TV series is
about the main characters.
In an episodic series like Star Trek, each week’s
show (or adventure) presents a problem or
challenge, which the heroes then tackle. At the
end of the show, the problem’s been solved. For
the next show, the Enterprise goes to a new
planet, encounters a new problem, and the
characters have a new adventure. You don’t
have to spend a lot of time explaining how the
Enterprise got to the new planet or why it was
sent there; all that’s really important is the fact
that it’s there now. Substitute dungeon for
planet and swap a long ride or march for warp
speed, and you have the makings of a D&D
campaign. 
Even a very episodic series like Star Trek does
have some connections between episodes.
Sometimes events or characters from earlier
episodes resurface in later ones. When you use
this technique in your game, it reminds the play-
ers that their characters’ successes and fail-
ures might come back to haunt them at some
future date.

You can introduce Fallcrest before the player characters ever set out on their
first adventure. Some characters might be natives of the area; others might
be travelers who happen to find themselves in the town when adventure
comes to call. 
We think it’s best to start the action of the campaign at the door of the dun-
geon, not at the home base. It’s fine to talk with players about their characters’
roots in town, their mentors or patrons, and the reasons they’re at the dun-
geon. But give the players a good taste of heroic deeds and dark dangers
before you show them a place where their characters do ordinary things like
bartering for goods or talking to people who don’t want to kill them. Fallcrest is
the answer to the question, “So where do we go when we leave this dungeon?”
The first time the player characters walk or ride into town, you should give
them a brief description of what the place is like. The following read-aloud
text is designed to do just that:
A pile of stone rubble alongside the old King’s Road, ruins of a long-fallen
watchtower, signals your arrival into the outskirts of Fallcrest. Soon the hills
and forests give way to tended fields and orchards, then the walls of town
come into view, gray and forbidding stone. The rush of the river greets your
ears, along with the distant roar of the Nentir Falls. 
In Chapter 7, we discuss how to ground player characters in Fallcrest using
the information on pages 208 and 209 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide, and
from there how to draw them into an adventure in Kobold Hall. In the rest of
this chapter, we talk a little about how to use the information in Chapter 11 of
the Dungeon Master’s Guide to turn your adventures in the surrounding area
into a campaign.
Story elements and your campaign
The Fallcrest chapter (Chapter 11) in the Dungeon Master’s Guide is full of
story elements that you can use in your campaign if you want to. These 
elements fall into three categories: 
 Player character backgrounds: Part of giving your players roots in
Fallcrest is tying them in to the story elements that exist in the town.
When you connect a player character warlord to Nimozaran the Green,
you’re also connecting that character to the history of the town, to the
wizard’s halfling apprentice, and to Nimozaran’s need for gold. Tying a
warlord to House Azaer gives the character an interest in events across
the Nentir Vale, and might bring the character into conflict with
Barstomun Strongbeard as he tries to extend the influence of the
porters’ guild. 
114
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

As you work with your players to establish their characters’ back-
grounds, be sure to pay attention to the elements of those backgrounds
that interest the players the most. Those are elements you should make
an effort to weave into your campaign arc.
 DM interest: As you read through the information about Fallcrest and
the Nentir Vale, make notes about which story elements intrigue you.
Paragraphs that begin with “DM Tip:” are pointers to adventure oppor-
tunities, but you don’t have to use them all. Note the ones that appeal 
to you and look for ways to tie them to character backgrounds and 
other events. For example, perhaps two DM tips stir your interest: 
the note about the ancestral sword of the Markelhays (in the section
“18. Wizard’s Gate,” page 203) and the description of Serim Selduzar 
(in the section “4. Nentir Inn,” page 200). You could easily link these two
story elements by having Serim concoct a plot to retrieve the Markelhay
sword, using the PCs as his agents. Or he might seek to discredit the 
current Lord Warden by bringing Aranda Markelhay’s cowardly flight to
public attention. 
 Ignore the rest: Just because the Dungeon Master’s Guide says some-
thing about Fallcrest, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s true in your
campaign. If certain story elements in the chapter don’t hold any appeal
to you, ignore them. If you have no desire to send the player characters
to fight bandits at Raven Roost, Grundelmar at the House of the Sun
(area 10) doesn’t need to have any interest in conditions on the Trade
Road. The dwarf priest might point the characters in the direction of a
different adventure, or he might not have anything interesting to con-
tribute to their lives at all.
Adventures in and near Fallcrest
The Fallcrest chapter (Chapter 11 in the Dungeon Master’s Guide) is full of
adventure ideas. The description of the town itself mentions no less than
three dungeons within and below the town:
 The Tower of Waiting (area 1)
 Ancient Crypts and Moonstone Caverns (area 9)
 The Catacombs (area 15)
Beyond the town itself, the rest of the Nentir Vale is equally rich in ancient
ruins and haunted catacombs:
 Gardmore Abbey
 The Sword Barrow
 Kalton Manor
115
Chapter 8: Running an Ongoing Game

 Keep on the Shadowfell
 Kobold Hall (detailed in the same chapter)
 Raven Roost
 Ruins of Fastormel
 The Fanged Jaws of Kulkoszar (in the Stonemarch)
 Temple of Yellow Skulls
 Thunderspire
Most of these are just story ideas that you can flesh out into full dungeons for
your campaign. And these are just the dungeons — you can also create urban
adventures within Fallcrest or one of the other towns in the area, or outdoor
adventures anywhere in the Nentir Vale. See Part III in this book for more
information on designing your own adventures.
Three of these dungeons are already detailed in published D&D products.
Kobold Hall, of course, is fleshed out in the Dungeon Master’s Guide, although
there’s plenty of room for you to expand it if you desire. The Nentir Vale was
also designed as a springboard for the published D&D adventures Keep on
the Shadowfell and Thunderspire Labyrinth. You can run your characters on
these adventures and the third in the series, Pyramid of Shadows, and bring
them all the way from 1st level to 10th level without using any of the other
plots or story elements in the chapter. However, you can enrich your cam-
paign by using these story elements as subplots and detours as the charac-
ters follow the main plots of the adventure series.

Chapter 9
Choosing Your Game Style
In This Chapter
 Catering to player styles
 Figuring out your style as DM
 Establishing your own style and setting the tone
E
veryone who sits down to play D&D as a player or a DM has a preferred
style of game play. Some people are most comfortable with combat-
heavy games that shy away from involved storylines or extended roleplaying.
Others view combat as a means to an end and don’t mind if some game ses-
sions don’t involve any kind of fight. As DM, you might decide to run your
game with tight control over the rules, or you might prefer to let your players
help you in your role as rules adjudicator so you can relax and focus on the
story.
If you’re wondering which DM style is best, the answer is simply whichever
style makes your game work best. If you’re a natural storyteller, it would be a
shame to ignore your strengths by running a game where you never get to
use that skill. At the same time, you should also consider the sort of game the
other players are hungry for. If they love beating monsters in fights, you’ll
have a hard time keeping them interested and involved if you run a game
where they never get to do what they like best. So, the best game is the game
that lets you do what you do best and gives the players what they want, too.
Pages 8–10 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide discuss player motivations, with an
emphasis on what you can do to keep your players happy. Page 12 goes on to
discuss some elements of DM style that we explore more in this chapter. 
Analyzing the Players
If a D&D adventure is a movie or an episode of a TV series, the Dungeon
Master is the scriptwriter, director, and supporting cast all rolled into one.
Like any good moviemaker, you need to think about the audience you’re
trying to reach with your game — the players. If the players are interested in
a fast-paced shoot-’em-up sort of game, they aren’t going to be entertained by

exploring their emotional range with hours of free-form roleplaying. Similarly,
if the players like to invest their characters with personalities and manner-
isms that no one ever notices because they do nothing but fight, fight, fight,
they aren’t going to be as satisfied with the game you’re running as they
could be. To present a game that the players will want to come back to week
after week, you need to figure out what they’re looking for in a game and give
it to them on a regular basis.
Different people look for different experiences in D&D games. Some players
want to see how many monsters they can beat, some players like the chal-
lenge of trying to act out their characters’ parts, and some players show up
just because they like to socialize and don’t really care much about the game.
If your D&D group includes players from opposing extremes, you need to pre-
sent a variety of different play experiences to keep everyone happy and
entertained.
The Dungeon Master’s Guide outlines eight motivations that tend to bring
people to the game table:
 Actor: Enjoys playing a character to the hilt.
 Explorer: Wants to know all there is to know about the game world.
 Instigator: Wants to get right to the fun.
 Power Gamer: Enjoys getting more powerful.
 Slayer: Likes beating on monsters.
 Storyteller: Thrives on the narrative of the game.
 Thinker: Wants to figure things out.
 Watcher: Likes hanging out with friends.
Most people don’t come to the table for just one reason or enjoy just one
part of the game — fortunately, human beings are more complicated than
that. This means that even the most serious slayer is capable of deriving
some enjoyment from the parts of the game that involve roleplaying and
interaction, and dyed-in-the-wool actors can have a good time with intense
combat action as well. 
Understanding these basic motivations is a start — you then need to put that
knowledge to good use. Get a piece of paper and jot down the names of the
players in your game, and then think of things each player seemed to espe-
cially like or dislike about your last session. What sort of character does each
player play? Does the player try to speak in character, or is he or she more
hands-off when it comes to roleplaying? What bores the player?
You don’t have to do this in secret, by the way. Don’t worry about skewing
the results of the experiment by letting the subjects know that they’re being
observed. In fact, you’ll probably get better and more accurate information if
118
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

you simply ask the players what they like best about D&D and what they
hope to get out of the game. Here’s a sample player survey you can use to
figure out what the players like:
1. What was your favorite part of the game tonight?
Players who liked “talky” roleplaying encounters best might be explorers
or actors; players who preferred a combat encounter are more likely
slayers or power gamers; and players who enjoyed a puzzle or tricky
challenge might be thinkers.
2. What was the part you liked the least?
Players who liked the combat encounters least are probably actors.
Players who didn’t like encounters with lots of talking or diplomacy are
probably slayers or thinkers.
3. What do you think is coming next? How do you expect the story to con-
tinue next week?
A player who is closely following the story of the adventure and thinking
hard about what comes next is probably an explorer or actor. A player
focused on the next big obstacle to defeat may be a power gamer or
thinker, but a player who doesn’t care what comes next might be an
instigator or slayer.
4. How would you improve the game?
Pay attention to what your players are asking for — that’s the easiest way
to figure out what sort of game style they prefer. You don’t always have to
give the players exactly what they want (in fact, it’s better DMing to
always keep your audience wanting a little more), but you might want to
rethink your current adventure if it looks like it isn’t going to be the
adventure that any of your players are most interested in playing.
Balancing Play Styles
Players naturally like D&D games that cater to their personal style. Players
who are actors at heart naturally think that the best game is one that lets
them spend the whole evening speaking in voice and demonstrating their
skills at roleplaying. To entertain those players, you can’t present a whole
session full of nothing but combat.
In general terms, you should adjust your own game style to reflect the tastes
of the players. For example, say you have five players at the table: Two
actors, one explorer, one slayer, and one thinker. For this group, most of the
adventures should include an even split between combat encounters and
opportunities for interaction and exploration. On the other hand, if the group
is composed exclusively of power gamers and slayers, the vast majority of
119
Chapter 9: Choosing Your Game Style

your game should be spent in dungeons and battle scenes. The only reason
to throw a noncombat encounter at this group is for the sake of pacing and
variety.
DM Styles: Running the 
Game You Run Best
When you’re thinking about DMing a game session or adventure, the first
thing you should ask yourself is what sort of game you want to run. Do you
want a game with plenty of fighting? A roleplaying-heavy game with lots of
NPC interactions? A low-level game in the heroic tier or a game in the upper
levels of paragon or epic play? Before you give any real thought to what the
players might like best in the game, you need to decide what you would like
best. If you try to run a game that you aren’t really interested in running, it’s
going to show.
Are you more comfortable handling action-oriented games that emphasize
getting to the fight or challenge fast, or games that are more about roleplay-
ing and storytelling? Do you like to stay narrowly on task, or do you prefer a
more spontaneous approach to the game?
How you answer these questions can help you determine what type of DM
you are. Most Dungeon Masters fall into one of five basic types: the action
movie director, the storyteller, the puzzlemaker, the worldbuilder, and the
connector. Just as many players like a mix of power gaming and roleplaying,
you’ll find that most DMs like to run games that include some elements from
several of these styles. 
Take a look at the descriptions that follow and see whether you can recognize
yourself. The player descriptions we use in the following sections refer to the
player motivations (actor, explorer, instigator, power gamer, slayer, story-
teller, thinker, and watcher) discussed in the Dungeon Master’s Guide.
Action movie director
If you’re an action movie director, you enjoy the game most when the player
characters are locked in mortal combat against some horrible monster.
Everything else in your game exists for the purpose of describing how and
why the heroes move from one fight to the next. Some of the fight scenes
might be important to the overall story of the adventure or the campaign (for
example, a climactic battle against the boss monster), whereas other fight
scenes don’t have any real purpose in advancing the story of your game, but
instead exist solely for the purpose of testing the player characters’ abilities
to survive them (for example, a fight against a wandering group of monsters).
120
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

You might be an action movie director at heart if . . .
 The game gets easier to handle when you tell the players to roll initiative.
 You like to create straightforward adventures with plenty of fighting,
such as the typical dungeon crawl.
 You find it difficult to create unique mannerisms or voices for the NPCs
and often don’t bother to try.
 You’re most comfortable dealing with players who are power gamers or
slayers, and you don’t know how to react to the things that actors say or
do in the game.
Storyteller
If you’re a storyteller DM, you’re out to tell a riveting tale, stocked with great
villains, memorable allies, and supporting characters. It has a great twist at
the end that leaves the players emotionally drained. Fights in your game
serve the story, not the other way around — you’re inclined to view a fight
with a monster that the player characters don’t strictly have to fight (such as
a group of wandering monsters) as a distraction from the real business of the
game session. 
You might be a storyteller if . . .
 The game is easiest for you when you’re roleplaying an NPC with a spe-
cific part to play (ally or villain) in the adventure.
 You like to create sophisticated adventures that include significant
events and encounters that don’t take place in a dungeon.
 You take pride in crafting memorable mannerisms and voices for the
NPCs the player characters have to deal with.
 You’re most comfortable dealing with players who are actors or explor-
ers, and you find it hard to keep power gamers or slayers immersed in
the story.
Worldbuilder
You’re a worldbuilder DM if you’ve built a fascinating and deeply textured
game world, and you want to share it with your friends. The best way for
them to explore this imaginary world is through the eyes and experiences of
their player characters in your D&D game. Adventures you run reveal specific
features of your campaign world. Sometimes this might be a battle against
some evil faction or monstrous race that poses a grave threat to your world,
but in other cases your adventure might be designed to reveal something
about the ancient history, politics, or magical secrets of your world.
121
Chapter 9: Choosing Your Game Style

You might be a worldbuilder if . . .
 Your favorite part of the game is the creative exercise of inventing
towns, kingdoms, and nonplayer characters before the game session
even starts.
 You rarely use adventures you don’t create yourself.
 You provide the players with extra information or options for character
creation that help them to ground their characters in your world.
 You’re most comfortable dealing with players who are explorers or
thinkers, and you find your game easily derailed by instigators or over-
enthusiastic actors.
Puzzlemaker
Your goal as puzzlemaker is to test the players’ wits, not their characters’
capabilities. You like to present puzzles, riddles, mysteries, and exotic obsta-
cles that don’t have an answer in the game — instead, the players have to
figure out what’s going on based on the clues you’ve given them. A tricky
combat encounter (for example, fighting against invisible, flying archers) can
be a puzzle of sorts, but your favorite challenges and obstacles don’t require
any sort of attack rolls or skill checks. If the players figure out what’s going
on, they beat the encounter. If not, they don’t, and it doesn’t matter how
much magic or power their characters wield. 
You might be a puzzlemaker if . . .
 Your favorite part of the game is when the players try to figure out how
to beat a tricky problem.
 You design encounters that can’t be defeated by the use of any skill, feat,
spell, or magic item.
 You like to use a lot of props and handouts in your game.
 You’re comfortable with thinkers and explorers, but power gamers are
unhappy because your adventures don’t let them use their characters’
abilities.
Connector
If you’re a connector DM, you see your game as a set of evolving relationships
between the player characters, their NPC allies, and the signature villains 
or monsters. Like the storyteller, you’re mostly interested in telling a great
story — but you see the story as something that spans multiple adventures.
122
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

The Big Story in your game is the story of the characters, and that story
spans many adventures. If the storyteller’s dream is to build an adventure
that’s as riveting and moving as J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings trilogy,
you want to build something as character-driven and engaging as George R.R.
Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire series. Discovering the destiny of each charac-
ter in your group is the ultimate goal.
You might be a connector if . . .
 Your favorite part of the game is when the players talk to each other in
character.
 You design factions and foes that the player characters must deal with,
and then you create adventures that serve to present them to the players.
 You allow the players to determine what adventure comes next by
choosing for themselves the things their characters are interested in.
 Actors and explorers immerse themselves in your games, but power
gamers and slayers wish you’d give them more combat.
Establishing Your Own Style
If you’re like most Dungeon Masters, you probably recognize characteristics
of your D&D game in several of the DM styles we discuss in the preceding
sections. The best games involve a little bit of everything, so your own per-
sonal style should revolve around the parts of the game you enjoy the most.
Although you should naturally try to play to your strengths, you also need to
keep your audience in mind. Each encounter, challenge, NPC interaction, or
bit of narration you present to the players in the course of an adventure
serves a purpose. Whether you intend it or not, these adventure elements
make some types of players happy while boring other types. If the table is full
of bloodthirsty slayers, don’t try to run a game that emphasizes connectivity.
If the players are actors, don’t feed them a game of fight, after fight, after
fight. Most players have the courtesy and patience to wait through the game
elements they don’t like very much in order to get to the game elements they
like the best, but you need to be aware of your audience.
Even if the players are hardcore power gamers or actors, it isn’t a bad idea to
include an occasional “wrong” sort of encounter simply to change the pacing of
your game. The players will appreciate the opportunity to use some different
brain cells and try new things, as long as they get to come back to the parts of
the game they like best. Unless you’re pretty sure that all the players are one
specific type of player and your game style caters directly to them, you’ll find it
best to mix elements of several DM styles into your own unique style.
123
Chapter 9: Choosing Your Game Style

Setting the Tone
If your DM style describes the elements you like in your D&D game, tone
describes how you like to run your game. Do you try to keep the game
moving fast, or do you let the players roam along at their own pace? Do you
carefully prepare every encounter, or do you prefer a more spontaneous
style? Are you striving to be the affable narrator of the player characters’
tale, or do you gleefully seek to destroy any player characters that fall into
your clutches?
The tone of a game is a pretty subjective standard. It combines particular
mannerisms, philosophy, and game goals into a distinct flavor that’s different
for every DM. The best we can do here is present a handful of sliding scales
for you to consider; set each pointer where you’re comfortable.
Autocrat or facilitator?
Do you expect to be in charge of the game table, or are you comfortable shar-
ing authority?
If you see the role of the DM as an autocrat, that means you take responsibil-
ity for adjudicating the rules and keeping the game moving. You’re confident
in your knowledge of the rules, and you’d prefer that the players not question
your judgments. You keep track of initiative and all the conditions and other
effects on monsters and characters. If you’re running a game for less experi-
enced players, this approach can help them enjoy the story of the game with-
out the rules getting in the way. The drawback is that you’re not giving your
players any incentive to learn the rules or feel any ownership of the game.
Running the game as a facilitator means that you’re there to help the story
along, but your players are partners in the process. You don’t have to be a
rules expert — if a question comes up, your group will find an answer
together. You’re comfortable delegating the tasks that you find burdensome,
which helps your players feel invested in the game. On the down side, finding
consensus about the rules and sorting out who’s doing what can sometimes
take time — time where the game story isn’t moving forward.
Arbiter or narrator?
Ask yourself whether you prefer to simply adjudicate the actions the players
take or actively narrate the adventure at hand. 
An arbiter is content to let the players succeed or fail on their own, offering
few (if any) hints to help them overcome difficult challenges or solve tricky
puzzles. Running a game based on strict adjudication is easier in some ways
124
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

because you don’t have to figure out how you’re going to help the players
through the tough spots. DMing as an arbiter is good for concentrating on the
basics of the game (controlling monsters and evaluating player actions)
instead of trying to juggle storyline elements at the same time you’re trying
to adjudicate the game. On the down side, it’s hard to run a high-energy game
if you maintain such a passive role. 
A narrator actively narrates the game and is interested in telling the player
characters’ stories. You want to see conflict and resolution, the development
of characters, and the advance of your campaign’s various plots and story-
lines. If the players stall out on a tough puzzle, you look for ways to move the
story along rather than allow the players to dump the adventure and go do
something else — you’re invested in their success. Active narration requires
you to be more interactive and creative in your DMing. You might have to
construct “patches” for your adventure on the fly so that the story continues.
(For instance, if the villain manages to escape when the heroes assault his
lair, a narrator might spontaneously add a chase scene to the adventure or
have the villain “leave behind” clues about his plans so that the players can
still acquire the key plot point information they were expected to get by
defeating their foe.) Active narration is good for keeping the players engaged
and interested, but it requires more spontaneity and ability to make things up
on the fly.
On-task or player-paced?
Some Dungeon Masters try to keep their games moving and keep the players
engaged in advancing the adventure, but other DMs allow the players to pace
themselves. 
If you’re an on-task DM, you can definitely tackle more encounters and
resolve more of the adventure, and you have a tighter control over the dra-
matic pacing of the game. The down side is that you, as the DM, are always
“on.” You don’t get many chances to organize your thoughts or re-energize
yourself because you’re trying to get as much of the game into the available
time as you can.
The player-paced DM allows the players to set the pace for the adventure.
Allowing the players to pace themselves is easier on you in many ways, but
you’ll find that you don’t get as much of the D&D game under your belt in a
game session. The players might feel like they’re at loose ends if you don’t
provide at least some pressure to make decisions, take actions, and actively
advance the plot. On the other hand, this style of game works very well for
players who enjoy roleplaying and exploration out of combat. As long as the
players are having fun, why worry about getting to the next fight or finishing
the adventure in a timely manner? 
125
Chapter 9: Choosing Your Game Style

Preparation or improvisation?
Do you like having every detail of your adventures planned out ahead of time,
or are you happier winging it?
If you put a lot of emphasis on preparation, you carefully plan your adven-
tures in advance. You read every page of a published adventure before bring-
ing it to the game table, and if you create your own adventures, you write out
the details of each encounter area in as much detail as a published adven-
ture. You try to account for every possibility, and you have details of loca-
tions, encounters, and interactions ready at your fingertips. The good news is
that you have a really good chance of having your game run smoothly, with
everything going exactly as planned. The bad news is that players can be
unpredictable, and if they decide to go in a different direction than you’d
planned, you might get pushed out of your comfort zone. You’ll have to fight
the temptation to railroad the players down the paths you’ve prepared for
them, but the reward of a well-planned, richly detailed adventure might make
up for the feeling of being steered down paths the players might not have
chosen for themselves.
If you’re more comfortable with improvisation — or just don’t have the time
for all that preparation — you let the adventure go where the players’ desires
and your own sudden inspiration take it. Your prepared encounters might be
notes scribbled on a map, pointing you to pages in the Monster Manual, or
you might not even have a map. You never have to worry about being caught
unprepared, and your players know that their decisions make a real differ-
ence in the course of their adventures. The risk is that your game might lose
any real sense of a story that moves forward beyond the immediate whims of
the characters. Make sure things happen to keep the game moving, and make
sure those things point toward a story that ties all these encounters together
into an adventure.
The key to successfully winging it is to give yourself a head start by building
up a reserve of Interesting Things — monsters you’d like to try out, map
sketches of rooms with interesting features or dangerous traps, villains that
can make a sudden appearance to liven up a boring game, or quirky NPCs for
the player characters to meet and interact with. You don’t have to arrange
these things in any particular order, but the technique of winging it works
best when you don’t have to stop and scrape together character stats or try
to draw dungeons on the fly. You might find it useful to check out D&D Web
sites, magazines such as Dragon or Dungeon, or even unused parts of source-
books and adventures you have on your shelf to build up your reserve of bits
you might improvise with later. If you stock up a folder in your DM binder
with emergency adventure material, you’ll never have to worry about the
player characters taking a wrong turn again.

T
he best DUNGEONS & DRAGONS games engage the players on several levels. A
great game involves the players in a story that’s dramatic, compelling,
and masterfully paced. It creates a backdrop that includes fantastic land-
scapes, magical vistas, shadowy perils, and terrible monsters. A great game
presents challenges that encourage players to use their characters’ resources
wisely, make good decisions, and work together so that everybody wins.
The point of including a compelling story, inspiring setting, and challenging
situations in your D&D game is to make the game exciting. Exciting games
entertain the players, and it’s a lot easier to Dungeon Master for players who
are having fun than players who are bored.
Maximizing Imagination
One of the unique characteristics of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game is that a
lot of the game — most of it, really — takes place within the imagination of
the participants. Much like reading a good book, playing the D&D game lets
players create a continuous mental picture or visualization of the action. You
can literally play a D&D game with your eyes closed, just opening them long
enough every so often to roll some dice or jot down a note or two. 

Narrating for all five senses
In most D&D games, you hit stretches where the Dungeon Master is narrating
events, creating scenery, or describing creatures or obstacles for the players.
In a published adventure, you’ll see text set off as read-aloud text, printed in
italic type, in boxes, or otherwise distinguished from text that’s for the DM’s
eyes only. The idea is that the DM can read these passages aloud to set the
scene for the players when the adventuring party reaches that point of the
adventure.
When you’re telling the players what’s going on around their characters,
don’t limit yourself to just what they see. Tell them what their characters are
perceiving with all their senses. Consider these two examples:
Example 1: You hiked up into the mountains to the abandoned dwarven
citadel. You stand in front of the old gates, which lie in ruin. Yellowed skulls
stuck on poles stand on either side of the path leading to the gate. They’re
marked with runes of some kind.
Example 2: You hiked up into the mountains to the abandoned dwarven
citadel. You’re standing in front of the old gates, which lie in ruin. The air is
cold and damp, and you’re chilled to the bone. Yellowed skulls stuck on
poles stand on either side of the path leading to the gate, each bearing a
crudely painted rune in the Davek script. A thin haze of acrid smoke drifts
out of the dark doorway, and from deep in the mountain comes the distant
ringing of hammers on steel.
The first example isn’t bad, but the second provides a lot more sensory infor-
mation. The characters hear hammers striking anvils. They smell smoke.
They feel cold and wet. Although the players may or may not be able to read-
ily imagine what the scene looks like, everybody knows what hammer strokes
sound like, everybody knows what smoke smells like, and what it feels like to
have cold, wet clothes. The listeners supply these details, making your
description of the scene far more real and engaging than one that appeals
only to visuals.
More evocative descriptions are great, but as a general rule, a DM monologue
of any sort — adventure background, read-aloud text, villainous speeches,
anything — shouldn’t be more than about a minute long. That means keeping
things you read to the players to 100 words or fewer. Give a good description
and then get on to the action before the players get bored. 
Mixing the mundane and fantastic
One of the reasons that the world of the D&D game is compelling is because
players actively try to imagine what things look like, sound like, and feel like
around their characters. It’s part of the escapism of the game, and it allows
128
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

everyone to have fun roleplaying. Forming a clear mental picture of what’s
going on also helps players to figure out ways to overcome challenges and
defeat monsters. The easier you make it for the players to immerse their
imaginations in the game, the more compelling and interesting the game
becomes. 
Imagination is fabrication, and like any good fabrication, it should be
grounded in truth. The more that things from the normal, mundane, everyday
world are true in your game world, the easier it is for the players to imagine.
Consider this example:
Example 1: Your trail leads into the Gresgil Forest. Anda, the great blue sun,
is high in the sky. Ryth, the lesser red sun, hovers over the horizon, while
Gel, the yellow sun, will not rise for some hours yet. The giant purple tree-
ferns tower over your heads, weaving and sighing in the wind. The mewling
cries of flerrbits drift hauntingly through the air. Suddenly, goblin warriors
leap out of the shadows at you. It’s an ambush!
Chances are good that the players are straining mental muscles trying to pic-
ture what the heck this place looks like. Is this normal to people presumably
born in this world? Or are the characters supposed to feel as weirded out as
the players likely do? Are the giant purple ferns dangerous? What in the
world is a flerrbit, and does it eat people? When the goblins jump out, the
actual encounter is anticlimactic. “At last!” the players cry, “Something
normal!”
Compare that with this example:
Example 2: Your trail leads into the Gresgil Forest. It’s early afternoon, but
underneath the trees the day seems gloomy, warm, and still. There isn’t
much undergrowth, but green curtains of moss hang from the branches of
the gnarled oak trees. Distant birdsong drifts down from the canopy.
Suddenly, goblin warriors leap out of the shadows, filling the air with war-
cries! It’s an ambush!
Now you’ve given the players a setting that’s accessible and believable. The
players might not envision exactly what you had, but you can guess they’re
going to get pretty close.
In general, if you assume that a lot of things in the game are the way they are
in the real world (or the real world of an imagined Middle Ages), you can
spend more of your “imagination capital” on the exceptions. Save your most
fantastic touches for things you want the players to pay attention to. Add
interesting details if you like (rain, sunshine, cold or hot weather) and then
get on to what you want the players to pay attention to — the goblin ambush.
129
Chapter 10: Creating Excitement at the Game Table

Suspending disbelief
The whole point of a roleplaying game is to pretend for a bit. Everybody
knows that people can’t just chant a magic ritual and whisk themselves a
hundred miles away in the blink of an eye, but for the purposes of the game,
we pretend that some people are powerful wizards. Wizards can employ
magic, and magic includes rituals, such as Linked Portal, which lets them do
exactly that. In other words, players choose not to apply their natural skepti-
cism or disbelief to the game.
The key to maintaining the players’ suspension of disbelief is to meet their
expectations about their characters, the world, and the game. Anything that
doesn’t fit expectations and forces the players to reevaluate what they know
about the game — or the setting where the game takes place — drags the
players out of active visualization and lets their natural disbelief come rush-
ing back in. It’s like hitting a giant Pause button on the game.
Failed expectations come in three basic flavors, as we describe in the follow-
ing sections.
This world is a joke!
If you show the players that they’re supposed to treat your game like a joke,
that’s what they’re going to do. Sometimes that can be fun, but most D&D
games work better if you play the world seriously and let the players find the
humor for themselves. One of the most common tip-offs that your game isn’t
serious is a bad name. Names like Lord Binky, Tim the Wizard, or Castle
Stupenderous tell the players “don’t take this world seriously, and don’t try
to get invested in the game — it won’t be worth your effort.”
Capricious rules
The rules of the D&D game set a lot of boundaries on what exactly characters
can and can’t do. Arbitrarily changing the rules on the players is a sure way
to jar them out of their suspension of disbelief, especially if doing so creates
a negative result in the game. 
For example, the fly spell (a 16th-level wizard utility power) lets a character
fly — and a strong character can carry anything aloft he normally could carry
while walking, so he can pick up a buddy and fly him across a chasm. If you
suddenly inform the players, “Sorry, but the fly spell just doesn’t work if you
try to carry somebody else,” you’re asking for trouble. Despite the fact that
you’d like to preserve that chasm as an obstacle in your game, nothing in the
spell description implies that you can’t carry your buddies if you’re strong
enough. In fact, you’re inviting the players to go look at the description of the
spell and the rules for carrying loads. Whatever you were trying to accom-
plish in the game grinds to a halt as the players try to figure out what works
and what doesn’t work in your particular D&D world. 
130
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

Illogical consequences
Players expect that their actions in the world result in logical consequences. If
the characters defend an elven village against a dragon’s attack, the players
expect gratitude from the elves. If a villain gets pushed off a cliff, the players
expect that the bad guy falls and gets hurt or killed. If the characters purchase
a scroll with the Passwall ritual so they can break into a vault where they
know treasure is hidden, they expect to find the treasure when they finally get
in — or at least find a reason as to why the treasure isn’t there anymore.
DMs sometimes fall into the illogical consequences trap by sticking too
closely to the script. If the person who designed the adventure had no idea
that the characters might figure out a way to get into the vault right at the
beginning, it’s tempting to just say “you can’t get in,” or “the treasure isn’t
here.” But a better answer is to reward the players’ ingenuity and resourceful-
ness with the success they earned, even if that “breaks” the adventure and
causes you to do some fast thinking. 
Setting the mood
What do you do if you’re going to watch a scary movie? You turn down the
lights. Similarly, you might find that you can help the players get in the right
frame of mind for the game by using lighting, backdrops, and background
music to create the right atmosphere.
Lighting
If you want to convey an atmosphere of mystery, fear, and suspense, consider
keeping the lights low around the gaming table. Don’t make it so dark that the
players can’t see what’s written on their character sheets or read the results
of their die rolls, but other than that, darker is usually better. 
Music
Music is a pretty powerful tool for imagination, especially if it’s appropriate for
the current tempo of your game. Music is naturally a matter of taste, but what-
ever you and your friends prefer, you want to make sure it isn’t too loud — you
don’t need to spend the whole game session trying to shout over your own
background music.
The following genres of music make good background or mood music for
D&D games:
 Movie soundtracks: Most soundtracks don’t have much singing that
might distract your listeners with lyrics, and they’re created specifically
for the purpose of evoking emotion from the listener at dramatically
appropriate moments. Horror, fantasy, and science fiction movie sound-
tracks usually fit the mood and work best for D&D adventures. 
131
Chapter 10: Creating Excitement at the Game Table

 Game soundtracks: A small number of game soundtracks are available.
They have the virtue of being created specifically for the purpose of pro-
viding background music for D&D games or other roleplaying games, but
your mileage may vary.
 Classical music, classic rock, or heavy metal: These types of music can
work for the game if you find the right piece or the right artist and
album. But watch out for music that contains lyrics, which can be dis-
tracting to you and the players.
Don’t be afraid to save background music for specific game events, especially
combat encounters. If you have a pounding, heroic battle-theme playing
when you’d really rather have an atmosphere of lurking dread, your music is
getting in the way of imagination. Above all, don’t get so caught up in fussing
with the music that your attention is on changing tracks instead of on the
players. If you use background music, get it ready before the players arrive
so that all you have to do is push a button to get the selection you’re after.
Consider using a computer or MP3 music player (such as an iPod or Zune) to
create multiple playlists you can use for different parts of the game session.
You might have a playlist full of creepy atmospheric music to use when the
characters are exploring the catacombs, another playlist of dramatic sound-
track music for combat encounters, and a third playlist with more relaxed
music for the times when characters are in town or traveling across the coun-
tryside. Make sure you can change the music easily when the mode of the
game changes, and your players will notice the difference in mood.
Showing, not telling
One of the most powerful tools in the Dungeon Master’s arsenal is the ability
to show the players what’s going on instead of just telling them how the
action unfolds. You could take 10 minutes to describe a dungeon chamber in
exacting detail . . . or you could simply draw a map that shows the players
exactly how the room is laid out and where the monsters are standing. 
Page 25 in the Dungeon Master’s Guide discusses props you can use to show
your players exactly what you’re talking about — such as miniatures, illustra-
tions, and handouts. These props make visualizing what’s going on a snap
even for unimaginative players.
Telling — Descriptions without a visual aid
Say that one of the rooms in a dungeon you’ve created is an evil shrine. If the
player characters approach the altar in the center of the shrine, mummies
lurking in sarcophagi along the walls will burst out and attack. To describe
the room in careful detail, you might have to say something like this:
132
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

The room beyond the door seems to be a shrine of some sort. A big altar of
black stone stands at the far end of the room, about 40 feet from the door. You
can see two other exits: a passage that leads off into darkness in the middle of
the wall on your left, and an iron-plated door just to the right of the doorway
you’re standing in. The shrine is about 30 feet wide, and the ceiling is quite
high, almost 20 feet tall. Four big stone sarcophagi line the walls; two on your
left, two on your right. They’re carved in the image of ancient warriors in
armor. Above the altar hangs a twisted skeleton of bronzed bones — the
bones of a dragon, it seems. Purple tiles cover the floor in a semicircle extend-
ing about 10 feet from the altar, and three rows of low stone benches run the
width of the room, with narrow walkways on the outer edges.
Hopefully not every room in your dungeon gets this kind of over-precise
boxed text. However, there isn’t much here that the players won’t need to
know sooner or later. They need to know what features in the room might
pose a threat (the skeleton, sarcophagi, and odd purple-tiled floor), and they
need to know what in the room might invite a closer look (the altar). But how
many people could sort out a good mental image of the room and its contents
based solely on that verbal description? Which details would some listeners
just miss entirely? Which details would they visualize incorrectly?
Showing — Descriptions using a visual aid
Imagine that instead of reading boxed text to the players, you draw a map for
them or build one out of D&D Dungeon Tiles. Figure 10-1 shows what the
room looks like.
Figure 10-1:
The altar
room.
133
Chapter 10: Creating Excitement at the Game Table

If you show the players the map while describing the room, you might say
something like this instead. A word in bold type indicates that you would
point to the relevant feature on the map. 
The room beyond the door seems to be a shrine of some sort. Here at the
far end of the room is a big altar of black stone. Above it, there’s a twisted
skeleton of bronzed bones hanging from the ceiling — the bones of a
dragon, it seems. This semicircle is formed of purple tiles in the floor. You
can see two other exits: a passage that leads off into darkness here, and an
iron-plated door here. These are big stone sarcophagi carved in the image
of ancient warriors in armor, and here are three rows of low stone benches.
The ceiling is quite high, almost 20 feet above you.
The second description is much like the first — but with a visual diagram of
the room’s layout in front of the players, most of the room’s details are crys-
tal clear. You have to explain this room only one time instead of answering
question after question about what’s where.
Maps you create for the players fall into two categories:
 Map sketches: When all you want to do is clarify your description of a
room by providing a diagram, a map sketch is all you need. A map
sketch is simply a way to convey information to the players in an effi-
cient format. Figure 10-1 is an example of a map sketch. You can’t set it
on the table and use it as a board for your miniatures, because your
miniatures are too big. But the map sketch shows players exactly where
each feature in the room is located, and the map can certainly serve as a
template or guide you can follow for drawing a tactical map of the same
room.
Graph paper is the easiest way to present a map sketch to the players.
However, it’s a sketch — you don’t need to be perfect. Any information
you provide will be an improvement over verbal description alone.
 Tactical maps: A tactical map is a large map you create that serves as a
board for everyone to play out a combat encounter on. A tactical map
uses a scale of 1 inch = 5 feet. Each square on the map is therefore a 
5-foot square. Miniatures (if you use them in the game) are in the same
scale as your map, so you can actually set your miniatures on the tacti-
cal map to show exactly where each character or monster is during each
round of the fight.
Several handy game products are available for use in creating tactical
maps. Official D&D Dungeon Tiles are easy-to-use cardboard tiles that
you can put on the table in any configuration. With beautiful art on
every tile, depicting an enormous variety of terrain features and dun-
geon dressing, they can really bring a tactical map to life. The same kind
of vivid art, in predesigned encounter areas, appears on the poster-size
maps you can find in published D&D adventures, D&D Miniatures starter
sets, D&D Icons miniatures sets, and some other products. Poster maps
134
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

are great for dramatic and climactic encounters, especially if there are
large monsters or large numbers of monsters involved. Some poster
maps also work well if you fold them in half, giving a smaller but still
interesting area for an encounter.
Many people use a battle map for tactical maps — a vinyl mat covered in a
1-inch square grid. You can draw rooms on the battle map by using wet-
erase markers, like those you would use with an overhead projector. You
can also find flip chart pads marked in 1-inch grids at office supply stores.
You can draw tactical maps on these, though they’re hard to re-use. 
Pacing the Game
Whether you’re engaged in a scene that the players are visualizing entirely in
their minds or one that they’re experiencing in a more tactile, concrete pres-
entation, we recommend actively managing the game’s dramatic tension. In
short, you don’t want things to get boring. 
The rules of dramatic tension are simple: 
 Start small and work up to a climax.
 Don’t waste time on challenges or scenes that don’t threaten the charac-
ters or advance the plot in some way.
 Always leave ’em wanting more.
Cliffhangers
The oldest technique for dramatic tension in the book is the cliffhanger.
Instead of playing out each game session to its absolute conclusion, look for
an opportunity to stop a little short. If you do it right, the players will be posi-
tively chomping at the bit to find out what happens next. Instead of reaching
a convenient stopping place and staying there, take the player characters
right up into the beginning of the next big danger — and then call it a night.
Let the players spend the rest of the week wondering how in the heck their
characters are going to get out of whatever fix you dropped them in when
you ended the last D&D session.
The cut-away scene
Imagine that your D&D game is a movie, and you’re the director. You’re shoot-
ing a scene where Lidda the Rogue is exploring a secret passage in an evil
shrine, while her friends are waiting behind her. Suddenly, fiendish dire rats
135
Chapter 10: Creating Excitement at the Game Table

set on Lidda in the dark passageway, while fanatical temple guards find her
friends and attack. How would you shoot the scene? You could just run the
combat one round at a time, letting the characters take their turns in order
regardless of whether they’re in the same fight. Alternatively, you might use
the cut-away scene technique: You could play through several rounds of one
fight scene and then cut away to the other scene. Your “camera” follows Lidda
for a time as she explores the passage and encounters the dire rats, and then
it jumps back to the rest of the characters when the temple guards burst into
the room, and then jumps back to Lidda after the first round or two of the
temple guard fight, in time to see how she’s doing against the dire rats.
The cut-away scene works best when the player characters are divided. They
might be only a few feet away in another room, or they might be engaged in
completely different adventures that are only loosely linked to each other.
Spend 5 to 10 minutes dealing with one discrete storyline in your adventure;
then put that action on hold (usually at a dramatic moment, using the
cliffhanger technique) while you switch over to DM one of the other players
through whatever his or her character is doing; then switch away again when
you’re ready.
Cut-away scenes are incredibly effective in both books and movies — just as
soon as something reaches a breaking point, the action jumps away to
another character and follows him or her for a time. At the gaming table,
keep your cut-away scenes short. Remember, while you’re giving attention to
one character or group of characters, other players at the table are sitting
around doing nothing except watching and listening. Try to give each player
at the table about the same amount of your time and energy.
Getting to the fun fast
Many D&D adventures contain a serious flaw: In one way or another, they
make the players search for the fun. If the players can’t figure out what their
characters are supposed to be doing or just hit what seems to be a dead end,
they get frustrated.
Obstacles that sometimes get in the way of finding the fun include
 They didn’t find the secret room. If the characters have to find a well-
hidden secret door in your dungeon in order to keep playing, you might
be hiding the fun. Make sure that plenty of clues exist elsewhere in the
dungeon to suggest how to find secret places.
 They didn’t talk to the right guy. If the characters have a whole town full
of people to interview in order to locate the one NPC who can tell them
what they need to do next, you’re hiding the fun for everybody except
the most die-hard actor players. When you design your adventure, make
136
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

sure that multiple NPCs possess clues that can point the characters in
the right direction. Some clues might be better than others, but at least
the odds of figuring out someplace to go next are pretty good.
 They didn’t solve the puzzle. Sometimes you might stump the charac-
ters with a riddle or physical puzzle. If they need to solve the puzzle of
aligning the levers in the room the right way to open the otherwise
impassable door and just can’t do it, you stop the adventure dead. Make
sure that clues are available if the players need the help.
 They didn’t bring the right magic. Maybe the characters needed to
have access to a specific spell or ritual (say, the Water Breathing ritual
or the fly spell) to get past an obstacle. Provide clues ahead of time that
suggest to the players what preparations they’ll need to succeed, or
make sure that a detour route is available. The detour can be difficult
and dangerous, but that will just reward those characters who prepared
for the challenge.
Making the players use their brains is perfectly okay. Every now and then, the
players should hit challenges or obstacles that make them think hard about
what to do next. You just need to make sure that they’ll be able to come up
with an answer when they have to stop and figure things out.
Keeping the Game Moving
Every good Dungeon Master has a set of techniques, tricks, and mannerisms
that help keep the game in motion and help to keep it interesting. These tools
are a part of your DMing style. When you don’t know what exactly to do next,
use the simple techniques in the following sections to think through to the
answer.
What does the monster do?
The player characters are in the middle of a fierce battle against a bone devil,
and the bone devil’s turn comes up. What does it do? Which character does it
attack? You have to make a decision, and while you’re pondering the ques-
tion, the game is frozen for the players.
The bone devil is smart, dangerous, and actually pretty straightforward.
Although it has four special powers, one course of action is usually the clear
best choice: Use fiendish focus as a minor action and then make a double
attack against the same target. If it hits with both claw attacks, it can use its
poison sting as well, dishing out a lot of damage to that one target. 
137
Chapter 10: Creating Excitement at the Game Table

Who does it attack? Answering the following questions is one way to think
through that question pretty simply:
1. Is it marked?
If the fighter or paladin (or another character) has marked the devil, it’s
usually a good idea for the devil to attack that character. You should
always assume that monsters with more than a few points of intelligence
know the consequences of any condition put on them, so the devil
knows it’ll take damage for attacking someone other than the paladin or
take an attack if it ignores the fighter. It should have a pretty good
reason to ignore a mark.
2. Is there a clear threat?
If it’s not marked, a monster should go after the character it perceives as
most dangerous. In the same way that smart players concentrate their
attacks on the most dangerous foe first, smart monsters try to take
down the heaviest hitters before those characters kill them. A smart
monster like a bone devil is probably good at figuring out who’s a dan-
gerous enemy, which might mean teleporting past the fighter and pal-
adin to beat on the wizard or rogue. In the mind of a dumb monster, the
most dangerous foe might be “the one who just hurt me.” 
3. Who can it reach?
Other things being equal, a monster will attack whoever it can most
easily get to. It’s usually easiest to attack an adjacent foe rather than
trying to move around, but a bone devil’s ability to teleport means that
it can easily get to any character within 8 squares. 
4. Does it have too many (or no) suitable targets?
When the monster has more than one logical choice of targets, or it isn’t
clear which character it would consider the biggest threat, let the dice
decide. For example, if two characters are next to the devil, the devil’s
not marked, and neither one is clearly more dangerous than the other,
pick up a d6 — if the result is 1–3, the bone devil attacks the character
on its left; if the result is 4–6, it attacks the one on its right.
You can also let the dice decide the answers to questions you just haven’t pre-
pared for. If the players surprise you by offering a pair of orc guards a bribe to
let them pass deeper into the dungeon, and you honestly have no idea whether
the orcs might be amenable to such an arrangement, you could toss a die to
see how likely they are to let greed overcome bloodthirstiness. For example,
you could say to yourself, “On a scale of 1 to 10, just how bribable are these
orcs?” and throw a d10 to see what you get. If you roll a 1 or a 2, take it as an
indication that the orcs are offended that the heroes think they can just buy
their way through the dungeon. If you roll something like a 9 or 10, well, clearly
those orcs aren’t happy with the pittance the dark overlord pays them and are
more than willing to line their pockets any way they can. If you know the orcs
are hostile, don’t bother making a random roll — just play the encounter out
accordingly.
138
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

Here are two important caveats for letting the dice decide: 
 If an intelligent monster clearly has a best choice for its action, the
monster should probably take it. A mind flayer confronting several
player characters at the same time will almost certainly use its mind
blast attack. That’s the smartest thing it could do, and mind flayers are
cunning, intelligent monsters.
 If an option or decision clearly makes for a more interesting or excit-
ing adventure, don’t let the dice screw it up. You might have had no
plans at all for allowing the heroes to bribe the orc guards, but it would
be a shame to stomp on the players’ creativity by refusing to allow the
ploy a chance to work.
Can I try this?
Player characters have an array of exciting and interesting powers at their
command, but sometimes the players want to try something different —
something not covered by either their characters’ powers or the basic rules
of the game. Remember, this is a good thing. It’s one of the things that makes
playing D&D different (and, in our opinion, better) than playing a computer
game — characters can try things the designers of the game or adventure
never dreamed of. As the DM, it’s your job to tell them what happens when
they try.
When players want their characters to try something the rules don’t seem to
cover, the best answer you can give is, “Make a check.” That could be a skill
check, an ability check, an attack roll, or sometimes just a “luck check” that’s
akin to rolling to decide how bribable the orcs are — how lucky is the charac-
ter at the moment? 
The Dungeon Master’s Guide (page 42) gives some guidance on how to set the
Difficulty Class (DC) for a check that’s not covered by other rules, but it ulti-
mately comes down to a judgment call. You have to decide on the following
three factors: 
 What’s reasonable? Use your common sense. Sometimes, players will
want to try things that shouldn’t have a chance of succeeding, even in
the fantastic world of D&D. If a character who has been polymorphed
into a horse wants to climb a tree, no Athletics check he could possibly
make will get him up those branches. The best Diplomacy check in the
world won’t let a character persuade an NPC to jump off a cliff. A rogue
can’t blow out a candle that’s on the other side of a closed window. You
get the idea.
139
Chapter 10: Creating Excitement at the Game Table

On the other hand, the world of D&D is magical, and some things that
aren’t possible in the real world can happen in a fantasy world. A human
could jump a 40-foot chasm . . . if he’s an epic-level character with magi-
cal help and the dice fall just right. Don’t shoot down an action that’s
clearly within the spirit of the rules.
 How hard is it? Use moderate DCs most of the time, but listen to your
gut when the player tells you what he wants to do. If your first instinct is
to say, “No way!” then use a hard DC. If your first reaction is more like,
“Sure, you can do that,” then use an easy DC. But bear in mind the level
of the characters and the things the rules say they should be able to do.
With a running start and an Athletics check result of 30, a character can
break real-world long jump records. A DC 30 check is hard for characters
at the top of the paragon tier, and it gets close to moderate for epic-level
characters. Epic-level characters are supposed to be superheroic, so
keep that sense of scale in mind when picking a difficulty.
 What happens next? Even if the character doesn’t reach the DC you
picked, or you think the task was just about impossible anyway, try to
reward the player with interesting consequences. Sometimes that might
mean leaping out of the frying pan and into the fire, but for a lot of play-
ers, that’s reward enough. (It’s often instigator players who try crazy
things, and they’re just as happy to land in a new mess as long as things
are happening.) A minor combat benefit is an appropriate reward — 
perhaps the maneuver knocks a monster prone, pushes it one square, 
or grants the character combat advantage on his next attack against it. 
Powers exist to let the characters and monsters break the rules in cool ways.
It’s okay to let the characters do things that aren’t covered by the rules, but
watch out for two pitfalls:
 Improvised actions shouldn’t be better than a character’s powers,
except in a very specific, very narrow situation. It’s great for players to
come up with cool ways to take advantage of the circumstances, but
they shouldn’t be designing their own powers that are better than the
powers they get from their class. It’s great to let a character kick over
the brazier to burn the orc warchief, but don’t make it work so well that
they start carrying burning braziers around so they can do it in every
fight.
 Let powers be powers. If the players see a monster do something cool
and want to try it themselves, it’s worth reminding them that monsters
have powers, too. The kuo-toa harpooner in the Monster Manual can stab
characters with its harpoon and reel them in. If the characters kill the
kuo-toa and take its harpoon, can they do that? They can try, but they
won’t be as effective, because the characters don’t have the power that
the kuo-toa does.

Should the DM cheat?
Dice are fun, but terrible things can happen to the game if the dice fall badly
too many times in a row. Should you change the hit points or Armor Class of
a monster? Should you fudge a die roll now and again? In short, should you
cheat? 
141
Chapter 10: Creating Excitement at the Game Table
Should you let a character die?
Sooner or later, it’s going to happen: One of your
monsters scores a critical hit, or a player fails a
crucial saving throw, and before you know it, a
player character meets an untimely end. Should
you really go ahead and tell the player that the
character is no more?
Killing off a character is a big deal. You’re
knocking one of the players out of the game for
a time, likely for the rest of the session. Either
he’s waiting around for the other PCs to take his
character back to someplace where a raise
dead ritual can bring the hapless hero back, or
he’s sitting at the table busily making up a new
character. Worse yet, a lot of players just hate to
get a character killed. Nobody likes to lose, after
all, and getting killed definitely feels like a form
of losing.
On the other hand, not killing a character also
poses problems. The risk of losing (getting a
character killed) makes the game exciting. If the
players come to realize that their characters
aren’t in any real danger because you won’t
allow a game result that causes a character
death, what’s the point of playing out the adven-
ture? Success is assured, after all. There’s no
dramatic tension.
Our considered opinion is that the best games
include the risk of character death but that
characters should rarely if ever be killed in arbi-
trary, malicious, or meaningless ways. Although
a ferocious orc warpriest might be inclined 
to murder a helpless character with a coup 
de grace in “real life,” in your game you can
choose for the orc warpriest to stay focused on
the characters who are still fighting back.
Instead of wasting a round to finish off a
downed character, the monster keeps flailing
away at the other characters. If a character
fails an Acrobatics check while crossing a
chasm on a narrow log, you might think about
having the character hit a ledge 20 or 30 feet
down and taking some damage instead of falling
1,000 feet to certain death. You might even fudge
a combat result by announcing a missed attack,
turning a critical hit into an ordinary hit, or delib-
erately understating damage dealt to a charac-
ter, as long as the players can’t see what your
dice actually say. Just try not to make it obvious.
So when should you go ahead and let a char-
acter die in the game? We think there are only
three good answers:
 When the party is facing a dramatically
important battle
 When a character tries something that is
obviously highly risky and exceedingly
stupid
 When the players have developed a sense
that their characters have nothing to fear in
your game
Even then, don’t be malicious about it. When the
characters are in one of those situations, you
can simply decide that you aren’t going to work
very hard to avoid killing a character if that’s
what the players’ actions and the dice decide.

Well, the DM really can’t cheat. In one sense, you’re in charge, and what you
say goes. It’s certainly in your rights to sway the results one way or another
to keep the game moving or to keep players happy. Still, many DMs like to
follow the same rules that the players must abide by. That’s perfectly accept-
able, but it takes away some of the control you otherwise can exercise to
make a fun and exciting game.
You might be tempted to cheat to spare a player character from a grisly and
untimely death. We go into more detail about character death in the nearby
sidebar, “Should you let a character die?”
Whatever way you decide to come down on this issue, never let the players
know when you’re bending the rules. The players need to be able to trust
your die rolls so they know you’re not playing favorites. It’s important for
them to believe their characters are always in danger, and they’ll change
their behavior if they suspect that you always fudge the action in their favor.
With no element of risk, the reward will be less sweet. So, our advice is to
play it straight, fudge when appropriate, and keep the players guessing.

Growing Your Game
In This Chapter
 Building a world for your D&D game
 Using your own rules and increasing character creation options in your game
 Involving the players in the campaign
M
ore than any other hobby you can name, the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game
inspires creativity. Power gamers and slayers seek out innovative ways
to develop their characters through the clever use of new magic items, spells,
and tactics. Storytellers and explorers gradually accumulate a library of sto-
ries about their characters’ backgrounds, personalities, and accomplish-
ments. Dungeon Masters constantly search for new adventure material to
throw in front of the players, and many also take the time to create highly
detailed settings for their games, complete with iconic villains, political
maneuvering, living history, and ever-growing storylines for the players to
interact with. There’s really nothing else like it.
In this chapter, we take a look at ways to expand the scope and creativity of
your regular D&D game. Growing your game keeps it fresh, interesting, and
vital for the players. 
Setting Your Game in a World
The first big questions to ask when you’re thinking about trying to expand
the scope of your game are, “Is there a world outside the adventure my play-
ers are currently involved in? Can they explore it? What will I tell them if they
do?” In other words, does anything important happen to the player charac-
ters when they aren’t in a dungeon?
Setting your D&D game in a living, changing game world is an excellent way
to grow your game. All of a sudden, you have room for virtually endless cre-
ativity. If you’re creative, energetic, and willing to pour a lot of time into your
hobby, there’s virtually no limit to the amount of world-building you can do.

We’ve seen Dungeon Masters who have built worlds of astounding scope and
detail, with dozens of pages of maps, hundreds of NPCs, and thousands of
words of history, culture, and arcane lore. 
If you don’t feel you have the time, energy, or native creativity to build your
own game world, consider using a world somebody else has built for you.
You can adapt the setting of almost any fantasy fiction to your D&D game
with a little work. Or you can pick up an official DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game set-
ting such as FORGOTTEN REALMS or EBERRON. If the players are already fans of
the fantasy story or setting you select to build the campaign around, you
have a great head start in getting them involved and interested in your game.
You can always settle on an approach that combines both of these elements.
For example, you might use an established setting like the FORGOTTEN REALMS
but drop in any dungeons, towns, characters, or monsters you create into the
game setting whenever it’s convenient for you. Or you can start with a world
of your own creation but borrow elements of the FORGOTTEN REALMS or EBERRON
to flesh out the details. It’s your game, after all. 
It can be daunting to wrestle with a whole planet when you begin your D&D
game. You might find it easier to think about starting with a microcosm
instead of a macrocosm. Begin your campaign with the dungeon and a simple
base town and then grow your game outward only when the player charac-
ters need to venture into some new domain or locate some new resource.
Why bother to fill pages and pages with notes about the interesting folk of
the Isles Beneath the Dawn when the player characters haven’t ever gone
more than 10 miles from the town they started in? Draw maps of far places
and write descriptions of exotic towns and people whenever you like, but you
don’t have to do either until the player characters are ready to venture into
that particular corner of your game world. 
We take a longer look at building your own campaign in Part IV of this book.
Adding New Rules Elements
Most DUNGEONS & DRAGONS games begin with almost 1,000 pages of game mate-
rial: the Player’s Handbook, Dungeon Master’s Guide, and Monster Manual.
Although you can create a bewildering variety of characters and adventures
with the rules and options in these three core rulebooks, you will find that an
immense amount of additional game material is available if you want more
choices. For example, there are eight character classes in the Player’s Handbook,
but future Player’s Handbook volumes, campaign settings, and articles in Dragon
magazine will provide plenty more, including classes such as the barbarian,
swordmage, druid, artificer, and monk, to name just a few. Many players find
that trying out a new class gives them a chance to do something in the game
they haven’t done before. The more options you allow into your game, the more
ways your players have to create the characters they have in mind.
144
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

Adding rules options to please the players is fine, but most DMs introduce
new rules elements for their own benefit on a very regular basis. Naturally,
you might want to create unique and memorable villains who make use of the
same sort of extra options that are available to player characters. You’ll also
find that the game benefits from a regular infusion of new monsters and new
magic items.
Not all rules elements are born equal. Some are very easy to implement in
your game and have a relatively limited effect. Others might require you to
really bone up on a complex new aspect of the game and will change every-
thing you do at the game table. The following sections provide a quick look at
the types of rules elements you might choose to include in your game, in
ascending order of difficulty. 
Monsters and magic items
Veteran D&D players have a pretty good idea of what’s in the Monster Manual.
They might not remember off the top of their heads how many hit points a
troll has, but they do know that dealing fire or acid damage is the best way to
finish off the regenerating monster. Using a monster that no player in the
party has ever fought before makes jaded players sit up and take note
because they realize that they don’t know how much danger their characters
are in. All of a sudden, it’s like they’re neophytes again, and they have to
figure out the best way to beat the monster with no out-of-character rules
mastery to help them along.
145
Chapter 11: Growing Your Game
Where can I find all this stuff?
If you like a game with a broader selection of
character options, monsters, magic treasure,
and everything else, you’re in luck — so do a
lot of other DMs. You can find all sorts of addi-
tional D&D material in a number of places.
Wizards of the Coast, Inc., publishes a variety
of official DUNGEONS & DRAGONS sourcebooks
and supplements, many of which include all
sorts of new material you might want to incor-
porate in your game. A number of other game
publishers publish D&D material through a free
licensing agreement with Wizards of the Coast.
Dragon magazine, now published online, is an
excellent source of new material. You can find
a tremendous amount of material on various
Web sites, from the D&D Insider site (www.
dndinsider.com) to any number of fan-
created Web sites. (We take a longer look at
sources for D&D material in Chapter 12.) Finally,
you can create brand new monsters, classes,
powers, and magic items for yourself.

Adding a new monster to the game is about the easiest new thing you could
possibly add. It’s entirely in your control whether the players ever encounter
the creature. If the monster proves troublesome (it isn’t clear how its special
abilities work, it seems too weak, or it seems too deadly), you never have to
include it again — just make a point of not using it in any more encounters.
An easy way to add a new monster to an adventure is to pick up a DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS Miniatures Game booster pack. Chances are good that you’ll find a
new monster (or a monster that you’ve rarely used before), along with its
game statistics, that you can use on the spot in your adventure. This way, it’s
a surprise for you and the players.
Rituals and magic items
When you make a new ritual available in your game, a ritual caster can buy
and master it the next time the adventurers happen to pass through a big
town. Likewise, characters can buy or enchant new magic items pretty much
as soon as they know the items exist. In other words, the players can put new
rituals and magic items into play more quickly than almost any other rules
element you add to your game.
New rituals are definitely cool. Players who have wizard characters or have
invested in the Ritual Caster feat are often eager to find rituals beyond what’s
covered in the Player’s Handbook to give their characters new and interesting
capabilities. Similarly, players enjoy finding or creating magic items that 
complement their characters’ abilities or cover their weaknesses in just the
right way.
If a new ritual or magic item proves to be detrimental to your game, it’s rela-
tively easy to remove it, negotiating with the player to replace it with a simi-
lar item or ritual that’s more balanced. That’s easier than having to take back
a paragon path choice or rework a set of feat selections.
Powers and feats
Making new powers and feats available in your game doesn’t provide you
with many new DMing possibilities, but it does provide players with the abil-
ity to explore new character abilities and archetypes. In general, these
options help players to specialize their characters and develop signature
combat tactics, combos, or strategies for besting the monsters. 
146
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

Unlike monsters, you don’t control these rules elements after you introduce
them into your game — it’s up to the players to decide whether they want to
take advantage of them when they advance their characters over time. Along
the same lines, it’s a little tricky to remove these elements from your game
after you make them available. If you find that a certain power or feat is caus-
ing trouble in your game, you have to convince the players to retrain their
characters to get rid of the problem. 
Character classes and races
Just like feats and powers, new character classes and races are primarily
player options. These options tend to sit at the slow end of the “speed of
introduction” scale, but they’re also about the most exciting new options
your players will come across. 
You aren’t likely to see much use of new character races unless a new player
joins your group or an old player gets his or her character killed and decides
to try something else. By far the best opportunity to introduce a new charac-
ter race is when the players are first making up their characters for a brand-
new game.
New classes are theoretically easier to introduce during a continuing cam-
paign because any character might choose to dip into a new class through
multiclass feats, but even then you’ll see the full capabilities of a new class
only when a player makes a new character of that class. 
Additional character classes and races do provide a staggering wealth of new
options for adventuresome players to try out. Consider this example: Say you
decide to add the sorcerer character class from Player’s Handbook 2 to your
game. You haven’t added just one new character type — you’ve added
dozens, because the existence of the sorcerer invites an experienced player
to try building a human sorcerer, a dragonborn sorcerer, an eladrin sorcerer,
or a tiefling sorcerer, or to try different character builds, such as a chaos sor-
cerer or a storm sorcerer, and so on.
Paths and destinies
Paragon paths and epic destinies are all about players choosing just the right
game element to reflect the way they imagine their characters developing as
they advance into the higher levels of the game. Both are decisions that play-
ers make only once, at specific points in their characters’ career (11th level
and 21st level), so the options that the players have available at those
moments are pretty much the options they’re stuck with. 
147
Chapter 11: Growing Your Game

That said, if a player with a 13th-level character comes to you with a new
sourcebook, points to a paragon path in that book and explains that this new
path perfectly exemplifies the way the player sees the character, you might
want to let the character adopt that path. The retraining rules in the Player’s
Handbook don’t allow retraining paragon paths, but you can certainly break
that rule for good reason. And the appearance of a new path that perfectly
expresses a player’s character concept is a very good reason.
Getting Players Involved in the Game
New places to explore and new character-building options are all very good,
but the single best way to grow your D&D game is to increase the players’
investment in the continuing success of the game. If you can succeed in get-
ting the players to care about your game, they’ll drive your campaign’s story-
line, seek out new rules options, and build better, more interesting characters
for the game — and that in turn will push you to present adventures and chal-
lenges that they’re interested in tackling. You motivate the players; the play-
ers motivate you. Everybody wins!
Players are most likely to become deeply invested in games where their char-
acters continue from week to week, so if you want to get them involved and
keep them involved, you need to create a campaign (see Chapter 8). The fol-
lowing sections share tricks and techniques for getting players wrapped up in
a campaign — and keeping them that way.
Crafting good backgrounds
The first step in encouraging players to care about your game is to encourage
them to care about their characters. Challenge the players to create interest-
ing and appropriate backgrounds for their characters. Even a few scribbled
notes to record a player’s creative thinking about who his or her character is
and where he or she comes from is better than nothing.
When the players create new characters, ask them to think up answers to
some or all of the following questions:
 Where was your character born? Where was he or she raised?
 Does he or she have a family? Why did your character leave them to
take up a life of adventuring?
 How did your character learn to do whatever it is his or her character
class does? How did your fighter learn to fight? How did your wizard
learn to use magic?
148
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

 Who are your character’s enemies? Are there any monsters that he or
she particularly hates or fears?
 Does your character have any interesting mannerisms or characteris-
tics? How did he or she come by them?
You might need to offer a concrete reward to the players for taking the time
and trouble to craft a good back story for their characters. For example, you
might give newly created characters a potion of healing if their players create
good backgrounds for them. A consumable magic item such as that potion
isn’t going to unbalance the game, but it’s a good incentive for even the
power gamers in your group to create interesting back stories that help drive
the campaign.
Using character goals
Just like real people, well-crafted characters change over time. They learn
new things, they develop history with allies who aid them and with villains
who oppose them, and they strive to make progress toward goals they deem
desirable. Players naturally want to see their characters grow and change.
Power gamers want to see their characters gain impressive new abilities and
garner respect in the game world, and roleplayers want to see their charac-
ters make progress toward personal story goals — quite possibly goals they
imagined when they first created their characters, however many levels ago
that might be now.
So how do you figure out what the characters in your game want? You ask the
players. It’s that simple. You don’t even need to spend time at the gaming
table doing it — an e-mail, a hallway conversation, or a phone call between
game sessions will do just fine.
Keep in mind that character goals can change over time. Things that seem
important to a player starting a 1st-level character might become passé when
that same character hits 9th or 10th level. You should periodically check
back with the players to find out whether their characters’ goals have
evolved since the last time you asked.
Character build goals
Gaining levels is a lot of fun, and each time a character gains a level, the
player gets a chance to select new and exciting rules options — new powers,
new feats, even paragon paths and epic destinies. Many players begin low-
level characters with their eyes already set on a signature move, tactics, or
capability they can’t wait to get their hands on. For example, a player with a
rogue character might look forward to the day he masters the hide in plain
sight power (a 16th-level utility exploit); a warlock might anticipate the level
at which she can enter the life-stealer paragon path and start collecting life
sparks; or a paladin might dream of the day he finds a holy avenger sword.
149
Chapter 11: Growing Your Game

When you find out what the players’ character-building goals are, make a list
of things you’ll need to plan for future adventures. Some paragon paths and
epic destinies suggest special adventures or quests; magic items are associ-
ated with particular levels. If you make notes of these things at the start of a
campaign, you’ll have an easier time shaping your campaign to include them
later on.
Character build goals are easy on the DM because usually you don’t have to
do much more than provide the normal amount of character advancement in
the game for the player to make progress toward the goal. Some build goals
might require a little work — for example, if a player wants to see his or her
character gain a particular magic item (that holy avenger sword, say), you
will eventually need to place that item as treasure in an adventure or even
design an adventure around the character’s quest to find the desired item.
The alternative is waiting until the character is at a high enough level to
create or buy the item, which is a less satisfying way of achieving such an
important goal.
Story goals
Character goals that don’t involve gaining specific abilities or options are
story goals. Story goals might be seeded all the way back in a character’s
background (“I’m hunting the six-fingered man who murdered my father so I
can avenge my father’s death”) or be acquired during the course of a charac-
ter’s adventuring career (“the vampire Erissyl killed our brave comrade Jozan
during our assault on the Ebon Tower; someday we will hunt her down and
avenge Jozan’s death”).
Story goals are significantly more work for you because each story goal
demands an adventure to resolve it. To help players achieve their story
goals, you have to provide adventure content that refers to these hopes and
aspirations. In the examples from the preceding paragraph, you’ll eventually
need to figure out how the player character can learn the identity of his or
her father’s killer, where that person or creature is now, and what he, she, or
it will do when confronted by a vengeful hero. On the bright side, the story
goals that the players share with you ought to provide a wealth of ideas for
creating adventures the players will care about.

O
ne of the biggest challenges you face as a Dungeon Master is simply
coming up with new material for each game session. Although there’s
no limit to the amount of adventures and encounters you can create with
nothing more than a bit of graph paper and some scribbled notes to yourself,
many DMs feel they can’t afford the time to generate everything in their
games from scratch. Learning how to acquire a steady stream of adventures,
encounters, maps, storylines, and villains for use in your game without
spending an inordinate amount of time doing so is just part of the fine art of
DMing a regular game. So, if you’re interested in presenting the best game
you can with the least preparation possible, read on!
Buying Published Game Material
The most obvious way to get good gaming material without doing all the
work yourself is to pay someone else for it. For this hobby, that means going
down to the bookstore or game store and buying professionally published
material for your game. If you’ve poked around the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS shelf
at your bookstore or visited your Friendly Local Gaming Store, you’ve proba-
bly noticed that literally hundreds of game accessories, sourcebooks, adven-
tures, and resources are all sitting on the shelves alongside the Player’s
Handbook, Dungeon Master’s Guide, and Monster Manual. 

Most of these game books are designed, illustrated, and edited by profession-
als, so you might find that that they’re as good as or better than adventure
material you can create yourself. However, this isn’t always true — quality
can vary widely from publisher to publisher and sourcebook to sourcebook.
Before you drop money on a new game sourcebook, take a few minutes to
thumb through the book and see whether you like what’s in there.
Understanding what’s out there
Published material for the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game falls into four broad 
categories: 
 Print material from Wizards of the Coast, Inc., the company that pub-
lishes D&D. This includes the core rulebooks (Player’s Handbook,
Dungeon Master’s Guide, and Monster Manual); additional volumes in the
core rulebook series (such as Player’s Handbook 2); sourcebooks (such
as Martial Power or Manual of the Planes); and print adventures (such as
Keep on the Shadowfell and Pyramid of Shadows).
 Online material on D&D Insider, also from Wizards of the Coast. This
includes the contents of two online magazines — called, aptly enough,
Dragon and Dungeon — as well as electronic tools to enhance your
game.
 Print or PDF material from a number of other publishers that produce
d20 material. d20 sourcebooks and adventures make use of Wizards of
the Coast’s Game System License agreement to publish game material
that’s compatible with the D&D game.
 Online, fan-created material you find on D&D Insider or other Web
sites. 
Adventures
One type of game product you can find is a published adventure (sometimes
referred to as modules) for the D&D game. A well-designed adventure includes
an interesting storyline, challenging encounters and puzzles, cool maps, and a
memorable collection of monsters and villains. More importantly, it saves you
a lot of time and work. All you need to do is spend a couple hours reading
through the adventure so you know what’s going on and how to get the player
characters involved in it. In a pinch, you can probably do without even that
much preparation and just drop the PCs right in.
Official DUNGEONS & DRAGONS adventures include the “H series” of adventures
in the heroic tier: Keep on the Shadowfell (H1), Thunderspire Labyrinth (H2),
and Pyramid of Shadows (H3). You can run these adventures independently or
join them into a series that forms a connected storyline. That story continues
with the “P series” of paragon-tier adventures and continues into the epic tier
with the forthcoming “E series.” 
152
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

Dungeon magazine is another great source of adventures. It launched its own
30-level adventure path in issue #156 (July 2008), but every issue is chock-full
of adventures you can drop into your campaign, making it easily the best buy
in gaming, whether you subscribe to D&D Insider or purchase individual
issues in PDF format. Dungeon also includes short features such as ready-to-
use villains and campaign advice to enhance your game and make your job
easier. 
Wizards of the Coast also publishes a few adventures specific to campaign
settings (such as Scepter Tower of Spellgard for the FORGOTTEN REALMS) and
occasional super-adventures. Finally, several other companies publish some
excellent D&D-compatible adventures under the d20 license agreement.
Adventures typically include
 A fully detailed dungeon, castle, temple, or similar site to explore
 Custom-built monsters or villains to fight
 A background and storyline that makes the adventure more three-
dimensional than a simple dungeon crawl
 A couple new monsters or magic items, as necessary
Using a published adventure requires less creativity and preparation than
creating your own adventure. Whether that’s worth paying for depends on
your own personal preferences and circumstances. Even if you don’t use the
whole adventure, however, you can usually use parts of it, such as maps or
monsters, for your own campaign.
Player resource books
Sourcebooks that are devoted to exploring specific types of characters and
introducing new character options fall into the player resource book cate-
gory. Foremost among these are the volumes of the Player’s Handbook series,
but this category also includes power source books such as Arcane Power,
books of equipment and magic items (such as the Adventurer’s Vault series),
and player’s guides for specific campaign worlds. 
Player resource books might include some or all of the following:
 New character races
 New character classes
 New powers and builds for existing classes
 New feats
 New paragon paths and epic destinies
 New magic items and rituals
 Organizations or sites relevant to the new material
153
Chapter 12: Using Every Available Resource

In general, player resource books don’t have much material you can use for
generating adventures and encounters for the players. However, the players
will find a lot of interesting new options for their characters.
DM resource books
Sourcebooks aimed at the Dungeon Master usually provide new threats,
rewards, or storylines for use in the game, as well as more advice for DMs
and more tools for your DM toolbox. Every book called a Dungeon Master’s
Guide or a Monster Manual is a book in this category, as are in-depth monster
studies such as the Draconomicon series and Open Grave, planar source-
books such as Manual of the Planes, and campaign setting guides.
DM resource books typically include
 New monsters, traps, and hazards
 Storylines, themes, or adventure suggestions
 Ready-to-play encounter sites, monster lairs, or short adventures,
including maps and monster or villain statistics
 Organizations, villains, and sites relevant to the new material
DM resource books naturally have more pages devoted to material you can
use for creating adventures and encounters for the players, and fewer pages
for new character options. Many also include chapters that have ready-to-
play adventures, encounters you can drop into your game with no additional
preparation, or keyed locales or sites you can easily borrow for use in your
own game.
Don’t overlook sourcebooks that are tied to particular game worlds. Each
year, Wizards of the Coast publishes a campaign guide, a player’s guide, and
an adventure for a new world you and your players can explore, beginning
with the FORGOTTEN REALMS in 2008 and EBERRON in 2009. A number of other
companies produce their own game settings that are compatible with D&D.
Even if you don’t play in one of these game worlds, you might find that you
can drop products such as these (or great portions of them) into your own
game setting with a minimum of work. Of course, your mileage may vary.
Miniatures and game play accessories
Not every D&D accessory involves something you read. Most DMs discover
that they need physical tools for their games as much as they need new
adventures and additional source material. If you use miniatures at the
gaming table, you’ll find that you really can’t ever have too many.

Figuring out what you need
It isn’t unusual to find that you can’t make use of everything in a particular
sourcebook in your game. Maybe the players don’t have the “right” mix of
character races or classes, or maybe you find that some of the material just
isn’t appropriate for the setting of your campaign. Fortunately, most well-
designed sourcebooks have plenty of material that you can pillage for almost
any game.
The single most important guiding principle in evaluating published source-
books and adventures is simply this: Does it strike you as cool? If the subject
matter is interesting to you, you’ll find a way to make it fit into your game,
and your game will be the better for it. Conversely, if you think it just isn’t
that interesting, it doesn’t matter how appropriate the sourcebook is for your
game or the players — you won’t have fun trying to build your game around
your new purchase. Save your gaming dollars for things that really inspire
you, and you’ll be happier in the long run.
Assuming that you’re going to stick to the cardinal rule and focus on things
that strike you as interesting, what else should you look for in a sourcebook
or adventure? The following sections pose questions that you should ask
yourself when you’re deciding whether to buy a particular new sourcebook.
Does it require a restart?
You might find that you really can’t use a new sourcebook or adventure
unless you’re willing to restart your game with brand-new characters appro-
priate for the material you’ve just purchased. For example, if you buy the
EBERRON Campaign Guide and decide that you really want to run a campaign
set in the world of EBERRON, you’re best off restarting your game with new
characters at 1st level, facing new challenges and tying in to the themes you
want to emphasize in your game. 
It’s up to you and your group to find a balance between playing a campaign
that never ends and restarting your campaign every time the player charac-
ters reach 5th level. You might let every campaign run the full course from
1st level to 30th, restarting every year or so. You might start some campaigns
at higher levels or end them at lower levels. But restarting your game every
once in a while is a good thing — it gives both you and your players a chance
to explore new ideas for characters and adventures.
One way to get the best of both worlds is to have two or more campaigns
going at once. If you buy a new adventure you really want to run, but it’s
designed for characters of a level vastly different from the level of the charac-
ters in your present campaign, you could wait until the characters reach that
155
Chapter 12: Using Every Available Resource

level, either in the current campaign or in the next one. But you could also
put your campaign on hold for a little while, have the players make up new
characters of the appropriate level, and run the new adventure as a brief
sideline from your main campaign. If you or someone else in your group
wants to start up a new EBERRON campaign while you’re in the middle of your
long-running FORGOTTEN REALMS game, why not try taking turns? You don’t
need to alternate sessions, but trade off every four sessions or so — let the
players work their way through a short adventure or major chapter of a
longer adventure and then change gears to play in a different world, with dif-
ferent characters, for a while.
Is it applicable to the player characters in this game?
Say you’re running a game in which none of the player characters have
classes that draw on the martial power source. You have a paladin and a
swordmage (from the FORGOTTEN REALMS Player’s Guide) as defenders, a war-
lock as a striker, a cleric as leader, and a wizard controller. Should you buy a
copy of Martial Power? That sourcebook is aimed at players of fighters,
rogues, rangers, and warlords, and by design you’re not going to find much in
that book to appeal to other characters. Similarly, a book all about elves is
great, but if none of the players in the game has an elf character, it’s hard to
see why you would really need it. 
Remember, if the topic of the adventure or sourcebook really catches your
eye, you can always choose to make it a central theme in your game. 
What can I pillage?
Even if you encounter difficulties when trying to incorporate all the new
ideas or material from a sourcebook into your game, you can usually find
something that you can use with little work. Most sourcebooks include a
couple of maps, a few good adventure suggestions, or even just a monster or
two you can drop into your game with no preparation.
You can usually pillage some or all of the following from almost any 
sourcebook: 
 Monsters: Most D&D sourcebooks or adventures include at least one or
two new monsters. Check to see whether the sourcebook includes
unique monsters you can use somewhere else in your game.
 Adventure hooks: Many sourcebooks offer a number of adventure sug-
gestions. Good ideas for adventures are invaluable.
 Maps: If you’re cartographically challenged, you’ll often find that the
best way to map out your next dungeon is to simply use a map from one
of your sourcebooks and create your own keyed encounters and chal-
lenges based on that map. Check out the sourcebook’s maps and see
whether they’re interesting, well-rendered, and easily adaptable to multi-
ple purposes.

Using D&D Insider
D&D Insider is a subscription-based suite of tools and resources on the
Internet, created by Wizards of the Coast and designed to enhance your
game. Some elements of D&D Insider are similar to printed resources — the
types of material in the online Dragon and Dungeon magazines are the same
as what you’d find in printed sourcebooks and adventures. Other elements
are unique to the digital environment. You can discover more about D&D
Insider at www.dndinsider.com.
The D&D magazines
Prior to 2008, Dragon and Dungeon were printed magazines available on news-
stands and by subscription. Now, they’ve moved online, where they provide
the cornerstone of the D&D Insider suite. The two magazines combined contain
roughly 180 pages of all-new content each month, which is like getting a new
sourcebook chock-full of useful resources delivered to your computer each
month. The content in Dragon is more player-focused, with articles that expand
character options, explore elements of the D&D world, and preview material
from upcoming Wizards of the Coast sourcebooks. Dungeon, though, is just for
you, the Dungeon Master. Each issue includes several ready-to-play adventures,
as well as regular columns full of advice to make your game better. 
You can find Dragon magazine at www.wizards.com/dragon, and Dungeon
at www.wizards.com/dungeon.
157
Chapter 12: Using Every Available Resource
Which edition?
Most of the time, you’re better off spending your
gaming dollars on material designed for the cur-
rent, 4th Edition of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
game. However, your hobby store might stock
older 3rd Edition DUNGEONS & DRAGONS supple-
ments, or even older books from prior editions.
Although they aren’t compatible with the cur-
rent edition, you might find these out-of-date
sourcebooks have enough maps, adventure
hooks, or story ideas to make them worth a
second look, though you’ll need to do some
work to make them current with your game. 
Some types of sourcebooks are more useful
than others if the rules in them are obsolete. For
example, books detailing campaign settings can
be quite useful regardless of the edition of the
game they’re designed for. You might even find
setting books for other game systems useful for
inspiration for your campaign, in the same way
you might draw on a fantasy novel to help flesh
out your own setting. On the other hand, a book
with a heavy emphasis on rules elements, such
as a book full of 3rd Edition feats and classes,
will be much harder to use in a 4th Edition game.
As always, your mileage may vary.

D&D Compendium
The D&D Compendium is a searchable database containing all the options
that are an official part of the D&D game — every race, class, paragon path,
epic destiny, skill, feat, power, item, and ritual that appears in a printed
sourcebook or one of the online magazines. Even if you’re not a D&D Insider
subscriber, you can use the search function of the Compendium as a detailed
index to your printed books. If you’re a subscriber, the Compendium search
will give you the full rules text of all these elements. It’s a great way to pre-
view what’s in a new sourcebook before you decide to buy it or even to
replace the physical books on your shelves. 
The D&D Compendium is located at www.wizards.com/default.
asp?x=dnd/insider/compendium.
The D&D Game Table
You can use the D&D Game Table to play a completely digital version of
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS — sitting with your friends around a virtual table on the
Internet, referencing the D&D Compendium instead of printed rule books, and
using character sheets stored online. The D&D Game Table provides virtual
Dungeon Tiles and miniatures, includes built-in voice chat, helps you track
initiative in combat, and lets you share pictures and handouts with players
online. The goal is to replicate the tabletop gaming experience as closely as
possible, so it’s still D&D and not a computer game. You’re still interacting
with other people in a game run by a Dungeon Master. But in other ways it’s a
lot like playing a multiplayer online game — you can play when it’s conve-
nient for you with friends who might be scattered across the globe, or with
strangers you find in the lobby of the Game Table application. 
The D&D Game Table can also be useful for a game you play at a physical
table. With a computer connected to a large-screen TV or projector, you can
display vivid 3D dungeons to your players and make use of all the helpful
tools to make combat run more smoothly. 
At the time of this writing, the D&D Game Table is still in development. Find
out more at www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/insider/
gametable.
The D&D Dungeon Builder
The D&D Dungeon Builder is a simple click-and-drag dungeon tile mapper you
can use to create beautiful dungeon maps and tactical maps for your D&D
game. Whether you’re playing on a physical tabletop or the digital D&D Game
Table, the D&D Dungeon Builder is an easy way to make great-looking maps. 
158

Like the Game Table, the Dungeon Builder is still getting its final polish.

Using the Rest of the Internet
Besides the ready-made tools available as part of D&D Insider, the Internet
offers some great ways to keep track of the details of your regular D&D game.
For example:
 Web site: You can create a Web site devoted to your game that your
players can access anytime they want to read up on what’s going on in
the game world. Nobody has to carry around a big, disorganized note-
book or misplace handouts you provided if an ongoing journal of your
game is a persistent, ever-growing section of your Web page.
A Web site is also a great place to keep information that’s generally
useful for your game. For example, if you have a set of rules or notes
about which game sourcebooks you allow in your game and which ones
you don’t, you can build a Character Creation tab or page for your site. If
you have extensive notes about the people or places in your game world
that you think the player characters ought to be familiar with, write
them up and post them on a World Atlas or Campaign Gazetteer page.
 Blog: Blogs (short for Web logs, which are online journals for those of
you who haven’t joined the 21st century yet) are excellent formats for
maintaining a lasting journal of your game. Like with a Web site, you can
use a blog to keep an online journal of your game that the players can
access anytime they please.
Most blog hosts allow users to leave comments on blog entries, so your
players can easily add their own comments to an entry journaling the
latest adventure.
You might also want to collect and maintain electronic versions of the play-
ers’ character sheets and keep the updated files on your Web site. That way,
if a player doesn’t show up or forgets his or her character sheet, you can
always hop on any Internet-connected computer and download the latest ver-
sion of a character should you need it. Similarly, you can ask the players to
contribute interesting content about their characters to your site.
One of the more interesting techniques DMs use to keep player interest in
their campaigns bubbling is to use a Web site or blog to publish an in-world
newsletter — articles, missives, correspondence, or similar documents writ-
ten “in character” that show what’s going on in the game world. Imagine what
sort of flier or pamphlet a town crier might read from in a town where the
player characters are involved in dangerous dealings, heroic rescues, and
deadly monster hunts, and post that on your Web site or blog. Are the writers
159
Chapter 12: Using Every Available Resource

of the pamphlet friends of the heroes, who celebrate their successes? Or are
they suspicious, narrow-minded gossips who delight in passing along every
petty rumor they can find? Creating the Web page or blog entries for the game
world’s newsletter takes a little work, but it’s a great payoff for the players.
Finding Story Inspiration
Many Dungeon Masters choose to create their own adventures and cam-
paigns out of nothing more than their imaginations. If you’re one of those
DMs, good for you! Devising exciting adventures and crafting a fantastic
world for your D&D game are some of the most rewarding parts of being a
Dungeon Master.
However, even the most creative DM can use a helping hand every now and
then. For some people, it’s a matter of time; depending on the amount of
detail and contingency planning you deem necessary in preparing adventures
for the players, designing a big dungeon might take up your hobby time for
weeks and weeks. Other DMs have the time but find it hard to come up with
original ideas on demand. When your creation well runs dry, try some of the
options in the following sections.
The real world
The first place you can look for ideas is right in front of you. Between the
Earth’s astonishing variety of terrain and climate and the similarly broad
canvas of human societies in different places and times, you can find zillions
of ideas for interesting adventures. If you need a floor plan for a castle, why
not base your map sketch on the plan of a real castle? You can find plenty of
books about castles at your local library or bookstore, or you might do well
to hop online and use your favorite search engine to see whether anybody’s
ever posted that sort of information to the Web.
Naturally, books on medieval life, history, or castles in general are useful to
many D&D games. Encyclopedias often have interesting articles on a variety
of these topics. In addition to references on medieval Europe, keep your eyes
open for books or articles pertaining to other times — the Dark Ages or the
Renaissance, for instance — and other cultures, such as the medieval Arabic,
Byzantine, Malinese, or even Chinese or Japanese Empires. Even modern-day
examples of exotic places and cultures might prove inspirational. National
Geographic is a treasure trove of ideas for a D&D game. If you check out the
interesting locales, maps, and portraits of societies and customs from all over
the world, you can find something in every issue.
160
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

Fantasy fiction
Over the years, thousands of authors have created tens of thousands of fan-
tasy stories. There’s no reason you can’t quietly borrow elements of a couple
from your own favorites for use in your D&D game. As long as you’re subtle
about it (for example, don’t create an adventure that’s all about taking the
Sole Ring of Ultimate Might to Mount Woe in order to destroy it in the vol-
canic fires where it was forged), the players might not even notice that your
adventure was inspired by a book you read.
If you want to use your favorite fantasy story as inspiration for your game,
here are a few guidelines to keep in mind:
 Short stories are better than novels; a short story can easily inspire a
single adventure.
 Stories with lots of action make for better games than stories that are
driven by the relationships of the characters. 
 The more obscure, the better; try to avoid stories the players are inti-
mately familiar with.
 Fantastic it up — most fantasy fiction is less fantastic than D&D, so con-
sider changing human kingdoms or characters into creatures of a more
fantastic nature.
 File off the serial numbers. Make sure you change names of places and
characters enough so that the players won’t recognize them.
Robert E. Howard’s Conan stories or Fritz Leiber’s The Adventures of Fafhrd
and the Gray Mouser tales are good examples of the sort of fiction that lends
itself to conversion into D&D adventures. You could do worse than to model
an adventure after Howard’s The Devil in Iron or Leiber’s Swords of Lankhmar. 
Movies and TV
Imagine this scenario: An honest lawman is hired to clean up a rough-and-
tumble mining town, but when he does his job too well, the corrupt mayor
calls in the hired guns to kill the lawman and stop him from setting things
right. It’s a plot from a Western, right? Not exactly — this is from the Sean
Connery movie Outland, which was really just a Western story with a science
fiction setting. If the formula works for Hollywood, it can work for you, too.
There’s no reason you can’t borrow the basic plot structure of almost any
action movie, replace some of the thugs and villains with monsters, and pre-
sent it as a D&D adventure for the players.
161
Chapter 12: Using Every Available Resource

TV shows also have some lessons for a DM in search of creativity. Unlike a
movie, which usually ends with the biggest and most satisfying resolution
possible for the hero, a TV show is a serial. A single episode can’t resolve
every problem the hero faces, because if it does, the viewers have no reason
to tune in next week. Your D&D game is more like a TV show than a movie; at
the end of the adventure, you need plenty of reasons for the players to come
back and see what happens next.
A well-written TV show commonly introduces an immediate problem that can
be resolved with reasonable satisfaction in the single episode you’re watch-
ing, but it also throws in elements of long-term plots and developments that
might never be resolved. Think of The X-Files: In every episode, Mulder and
Scully discover, investigate, and then deal with (or just survive) some imme-
diate threat, but in the background, several important storylines and recur-
ring figures keep the series-spanning meta-plot moving forward with
appearances by characters such as Cancer Man and Deep Throat.
It’s hard to imagine a better example of a serial adventure format for a D&D
game. Replace Mulder and Scully with the player characters, the immediate
problem of the episode with the dungeon they’re currently exploring, and the
meta-plot characters with long-term patrons or master villains appropriate to
your campaign, and you have the ingredients of a great campaign.
The collision of ideas
Want to know one of the big secrets of the creative process? Here it is:
Anybody can think up something new by taking two different things and
mashing them together. When you’re really stuck, try pairing up a couple
ideas or notions that don’t seem to have anything to do with each other, and
see where it takes you. 
For example, take pirates and a wizard’s tower. How could you build an
adventure around those components? Maybe the player characters want to
explore the wizard’s tower, but first they have to find the pirates who know
where it is and infiltrate their operation. Maybe the player characters can
find and explore the tower easily enough, but just when they think the adven-
ture’s over and they’re about to leave with the loot, a band of pirates shows
up to take the treasure away from them. Or maybe the wizard who dwells in
the tower has hired a pirate band to comb the seas in search of a magic gem
he needs for some special rite, and the player characters have to beat the
pirates to the prize — and then survive the wizard’s wrath. There are a dozen
more adventure hooks where those came from, all based on the collision of
two simple ideas.
162
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

Talking with Other Gamers
One final resource deserves mention in this chapter: the community of
gamers that exists across the world. You aren’t the only Dungeon Master out
there looking for an adventure for your Friday night game. Kicking around the
idea for an adventure with just one other DM can help you spot plot holes,
work out refinements to your basic premise, and come up with a hundred
other things you might not have thought of before. Other DMs might have
advice on how to handle characters that seem to be causing trouble in your
game, suggestions for challenges and traps the players would never expect
from you, or even old adventures and encounters they’d be willing to swap in
exchange for some of your own old game material.
Joining a game club
Depending on where you live and what you do, you might be closer to a net-
work of other D&D fans than you think. Many high schools and colleges have
gaming clubs for their students, which provide you with a supply of potential
players as well as a chance to network with other DMs. Local gaming clubs
often have arrangements with schools, libraries, or hobby stores for regular
game nights, providing a safe and convenient place to play D&D.
If you don’t have a gaming club close at hand (or if your school days are
behind you), some of the better hobby stores around often sponsor their
own game nights. Check with your Friendly Local Game Store to see whether
it sponsors any D&D nights.
Finally, there’s a worldwide network of D&D fans known as the RPGA
(ROLEPLAYING GAMERS ASSOCIATION). You can find RPGA chapters all over the
country. The RPGA sponsors several special programs that reward you for
joining and DMing for other members. You can find out more at
www.rpga.com.
Corresponding on the Web
If you don’t happen to have a local gaming club available, the Internet offers
the opportunity to communicate with countless other gamers. Message
boards at several popular gaming-related sites offer you an excellent forum
for seeking help with particular plot problems, difficult characters, purchas-
ing decisions, or adventure design.

We’re sure you’ve heard it before, but be careful about who you talk to online.
If you’re a minor, you should ask your parent or guardian before you visit any
online forum, chat room, or bulletin board. And never, ever provide any per-
sonal information to anyone you don’t know.
Wizards of the Coast Web site
www.wizards.com
The official Web site of Wizards of the Coast, Inc., provides support for all the
games the company publishes, including the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. You
can find previews of new and upcoming products, various articles and game
content, message boards, and pointers to mailing lists.
EN World
www.enworld.org
The EN World Web site is about the busiest D&D and RPG site out there other
than Wizards of the Coast itself. It’s a great place to find out about d20 prod-
ucts not published by Wizards of the Coast, so if you want to hear what
people are saying about other d20 companies, this is probably the place to
start looking.

The Candlekeep Web site is devoted to the FORGOTTEN REALMS world. The dis-
cussion here tends to run more toward the details of the world (some might

ative muscles and create your own adventure. 
That’s where this chapter comes in. We show you how to craft a solid adven-
ture, even if you don’t think you’re up to the challenge. In this chapter, we
examine the tools of adventure design and set the foundation for the rest of
the chapters in Part III. 
Breaking Down the Parts 
of a D&D Adventure
For the Dungeon Master, creating adventures can be a wonderful outlet for
creative expression and imagination. Although not everyone can be a Tolkien
or a Salvatore, every DM can craft solid, fun D&D adventures.

Adventure design doesn’t strive to craft a complete story. The DM provides
only part of the story — the rest comes out through the game and the actions
of the player characters. The DM sets up the basic plot and a rough structure
for an adventure, leaving the conclusions to come when the game is played.
This means that how things turn out will be a surprise to everyone, including
the DM. That’s part of the fun of the D&D game.
Like everything in life, adventure design becomes a lot easier when you break
it down into parts. Deal with each part, and soon you have a complete and
vibrant adventure. An adventure is a collection of related encounters that
create a cogent storyline. An adventure promises a story, offers obstacles, pro-
vides opportunities for each player character to shine, and delivers a threat.
As you build your adventure, think in terms of setting scenes. You set up the
beginning for each scene in the story, providing a place for the player charac-
ters to make a decision or select a course of action. Don’t think about end-
ings, because you want the adventure to play out through the actions and
ideas of the players and their characters. 
Always ask the players “What do you want to do?” or “What do you do now?”
End each part of your setup with one of these or a similar question, showing
that it’s always up to the players to decide the next course of action for their
characters.
Adventures consist of the following parts:
 The premise: The hook you use to catch the players’ interests and pro-
vide motivation for their characters.
 Encounters: The space for action and drama. This is where the game is
played. Encounters come in two basic forms: 
• Combat encounters
• Noncombat encounters, including skill challenges, trap encoun-
ters, puzzles, and interaction with nonplayer characters (NPCs)
 The end: The adventure usually winds up with a climactic encounter
and provides a variety of options for moving on to the next adventure.
The rest of this chapter examines these parts, as well as the other tools you
use to craft D&D adventures.
The premise
A premise sets up the promise of your adventure. It’s an initial situation that
gets the player characters involved. Some of the premise is background, the
things that happened before the adventure begins. Some of the premise is the
opening hook, the scene you use to start the adventure and get the player
characters interested. 
168
Part III: Creating Adventures 

169
Chapter 13: Tools of the Trade
Where to start?
Sometimes you’ll want to start an adventure
right at the beginning. However, this means that
a lot of the game is spent dealing with setup and
motivations. Every once in awhile, for variety, try
starting an adventure in the middle of the action.
Come up with an opening scene that’s reminis-
cent of action movies, something exciting and
intriguing, with plenty of flair and style so that
the players get caught up in the game. Start out
with a call for action and let the players decide
how and why their characters get involved.
There’s always a risk that the players will decide
to turn the other way, but in the end, everyone is
here to play D&D. Most of the time, if you dangle
the action in front of them, the players will jump
to get their characters involved. After all, that’s
where the fun is.
Using the example premises given in “The
premise” section, here’s how to start in the
middle of the action:
 The player characters are on the road to the
village of Welton when they come around a
bend and spot an ancient and partially col-
lapsed tower. The place looks abandoned
and very gloomy in the twilight darkness of
the forest. Suddenly, an eerie light flares in
one of the tower windows, and the player
characters notice something move in the
shadows around them. Unearthly growls fill
the woods, and the things in the shadows
leap toward them. What do the player char-
acters do?
 On the road to the City of Far Spires, the
player characters come upon a richly
appointed elven caravan. The caravan is
being attacked by marauding bugbears, and
already many of the elf guards have fallen.
What do the player characters want to do?
 The player characters have been hired to
guard the vaults of the dwarf lords. There
are seven connected vaults, each contain-
ing something more valuable than the last.
Over the past three weeks, the first three
vaults have been robbed. Now the fourth
vault is under the protection of the player
characters. Suddenly, the vault falls into
complete darkness, and the PCs hear a
strange, twisted laugh. “So you think you
can stop me?” the laughing voice calls from
the darkness. “Then let the contest begin!”
What do the player characters want to do?
The background is what has gone before, the lead up to the start of the adven-
ture. It could be long and complex — the war between the dwarves and the
giants has been going on for decades when one dwarf and one giant approach
the player characters with a plan for ending the conflict. It could be brief and
to the point — something has been killing town folk every night for the past
month and now the town elders are seeking help.
Examples of adventure premises include
 Lights have been seen in the abandoned Tower of the Mad Wizard, and
strange creatures have been spotted roaming just outside the village of
Welton.
 An elf priest needs someone to guard her and the ancient Elrooven Cask
that she seeks to transport to the City of Far Spires.

 A thief has been robbing the vaults of the dwarf lords, getting around
every trap and ward the dwarves have put in place. The thief must be
stopped before the next vault is plundered.
Encounters
Every DUNGEONS & DRAGONS adventure consists of encounters. Encounters are
where the action takes place. Encounters can be broadly grouped into two
categories: combat and noncombat encounters. With these basic building
blocks, you can construct adventures.
Every encounter is kind of like a miniature, concentrated version of the entire
adventure. An encounter has a premise and a setup. It has a location. It has a
goal. And it has a connection to the next step in the adventure.
Encounter goals can be summed up by the verb that best describes the
action required to complete the encounter — capture, defeat, discover,
destroy, escape, find, negotiate, obtain, protect, rescue, and survive are a few
examples. In an encounter, the player characters might have to defeat the gar-
goyle guarding the magic fountain, destroy the evil ring in the pool of molten
lava, find the hidden tomb of Baranka the Vile, or survive the dangers of the
Chamber of One Hundred Deaths. 
The following subsections take a closer look at the types of encounters you
can use to build your adventure.
Combat encounters
In most D&D adventures, the majority of encounters are combat encounters.
When you think of the D&D game, combat encounters are the scenes you usu-
ally imagine. 
In combat encounters, the player characters must face and defeat monsters
or other DM-controlled opponents. Combat skills and spells see the most use
in these encounters.
A combat encounter works best when it combines interesting monsters and
other challenges with an interesting setting where movement and tactics can
come into play. In the section on “Building Encounters” in this chapter, we
discuss how to plan encounters that account for the characters’ capabilities
and challenge them accordingly. 
Noncombat encounters
Noncombat encounters feature an obstacle of some kind — a hazard, a trap, 
a nonplayer character they don’t want to fight, or a generally dangerous 
170
Part III: Creating Adventures 

situation — that the player characters must overcome to attain the goal of
the encounter. These include scenes where PCs must talk to, convince, bluff,
bribe, insult, persuade, negotiate, interrogate, beg, or otherwise interact with
an NPC to advance the adventure. Skills are the primary tools characters use
to complete these encounters, which is why they’re called skill challenges.
Characters can also use utility powers and ability checks, as well as ingenuity
and quick thinking, to complete a challenge.

Chapter 13: Tools of the Trade
What makes an adventure exciting?
Remember that the players (or their characters)
can’t see the behind-the-scenes machinations
of your villains or the clever plot twists that you
have liberally sprinkled throughout the adven-
ture. You want your adventures to have the feel
of a great fantasy novel or movie, but you can’t
rely on the same tricks that those mediums use.
Don’t just imagine your adventure as a series 
of fights occasionally interrupted by periods of
talking. When you do, you shortchange one 
of the most compelling parts of the game —
playing a role. Give some thought to the per-
sonalities, motivations, and goals of your non-
player characters, especially the key villains
and anyone you expect the player characters to
deal with in noncombat encounters. In this way,
even scenes where combat never breaks out
can be memorable and exciting.
In addition to the goblins and orcs you use to
provide the player characters with rows of bad
guys to take down, you want to be sure to
include competent adversaries for them to
encounter. From common enemies to arch vil-
lains, make sure that these spotlight opponents
can stack up against the player characters. This
doesn’t mean that all your villains must be
super-powerful, but they shouldn’t be too weak,
either. Set up and play an intelligent villain, 
and that NPC can seem more powerful in the
game than it does on paper. And when you
create that villain for the climactic encounter,
make sure the NPC can stand against the player
characters for a few rounds, or that the NPC is
supported by henchmen or bodyguards who
can add weight to the scene.
Consider that the best fights take place in amaz-
ing places. Any combat encounter can be excit-
ing, but a combat that involves deadly monsters
and a dangerous or challenging location can be
memorable. Imagine a fight in a huge cave full
of pits, chasms, and ledges, where the terrain
becomes both an ally and an enemy as the
battle rages on. What if a fight takes place in
dense fog that gives concealment to creatures
1 square away and makes it impossible to see
anything beyond that? What about a chamber
comprised of raising and lowering platforms
that move at random and keep the opponents
apart? 
Remember: The players take their cues from
you. Your descriptions of each action that
occurs, the location of each important object
and participant, and the general environment
are crucial to letting players imagine the scene
and make intelligent decisions for their charac-
ters. How you pass on information can help set
the tone of a scene, as well. Speak quickly and
intently to add intensity to the action. Be slow
and deliberate when you want to build atmos-
phere or suspense. In this way, the players will
(perhaps even unconsciously) pick up on your
verbal cues and will become better at visualiz-
ing the scene and will make better decisions 
for their characters’ actions with each game
you play.

Situations where the characters interact with a helpful NPC — a character
who sends them on a quest or gives them information, perhaps, or a prisoner
they find and free along the way — aren’t actually encounters. They can be
great opportunities for roleplaying and move the story of the adventure ahead,
but it’s not an encounter unless there’s some possibility of meaningful failure. 
The end
Every adventure has an ending. Create a climactic encounter to end your
adventure. It should involve elements that have been hinted at throughout
earlier scenes, and it should provide the pay off that the player characters
have been waiting for — they get to deal with the main villain or at least dis-
rupt the main villain’s plans and save the day, for the time being.
The climax is where all the answers wait to be discovered — the true plan,
the true villain, the true evil behind it all. The climax is also where the main
battle usually occurs — where the player characters face the boss monster
and everything is on the line.
Not every adventure needs to be earth-shattering or deal with huge stakes,
but the end should still entail a payoff.
Sometimes your adventure is just one in a series that will take the player
characters up in level and unveil greater and greater threats along the way. In
these cases, you don’t want to have your villain defeated at the end of the
first adventure in the series. Instead, you should provide assistants and min-
ions — some that are powerful in their own right — to give the player charac-
ters someone to defeat and some insidious plan to foil with each adventure,
even if another plan is revealed right at the end.
Creating Dungeon Maps
Site-based adventures, which are usually dungeon crawls, are the easiest
adventures to design and run. Site-based adventures use encounters keyed to
a map, and the map provides a natural flow for the adventure.
Use graph paper when drawing your dungeon map. Each square equals 5 feet.
Mark encounter areas with some kind of key (numbers or letters work best),
and note any special features, such as doors, curtains, furniture, and traps.
Later, when the player characters have moved through an area, make notes
right on your map to remind you which doors they unlocked, which traps
they set off, and which monsters they defeated.
172
Part III: Creating Adventures 

It’s usually a good idea to keep the key to your map on a separate sheet of
paper from the map itself. If you marked an encounter area as 1 or A, use that
same notation on your key page. On the key, make notes about each area on
the map, including monsters, traps, and treasure. These notes should be as
long or as short as you’re comfortable with so that you can easily run your
adventure from them.
If you’re building a really simple dungeon, you can put the key right on the
map, noting the monsters that appear in a room right in the room, or perhaps
in the margin of the map, with a line drawn to the appropriate room. Just
remember that the less detail you put into your dungeon key, the more you’ll
be called on to improvise with details as you run the adventure. 
You can stay as simple or get as complex as you want with the details of your
dungeon. A simple dungeon is often static, meaning that you set the monsters
in place and that’s where they stay until the player characters encounter
them. A dynamic (and therefore more complex) dungeon features notes on
contingency plans the monsters have in place and often sets conditional
statements such as “if the PCs do this, then that occurs.” 
Use the various examples of maps shown throughout this book, such as the
dungeon map in Chapter 19, as guidelines when creating your own maps. You
can also refer to the maps in the Dungeon Master’s Guide or a published
adventure, but remember that you don’t have to be a professional cartogra-
pher to make a useful dungeon map! 
The Dungeon Master’s Guide has a lot of good advice about drawing maps that
make for exciting combat encounters. In particular, look at the points on page
60 (“Interesting Areas”), the three approaches outlined on page 110 (“Setting
Details”), and the mapping tips on pages 112–113 (“Mapping the Site”).
One simple and fun way to create a map for your dungeon is to lay it out on a
big table using D&D Dungeon Tiles. You might find that the art on the tiles
inspires you to add interesting elements to your dungeon rooms, and if you
build your dungeon this way, you’ll be sure that when you’re running the
adventure you can construct the tactical map for each encounter using the
tiles you own. You can also use the D&D Dungeon Builder, a component of
D&D Insider, to build a map with Dungeon Tiles right on your computer screen.
Chapter 12 discusses the Dungeon Builder and D&D Insider in more detail.
Building Encounters
In general, you populate a dungeon (or any kind of adventure) with oppo-
nents to challenge the player characters. Some of these opponents take the
173
Chapter 13: Tools of the Trade

form of traps or natural hazards, but the majority of the opponents appear in
the form of monsters or villains.
You can take monsters right out of any one of a number of ready-to-use
sources, including the D&D Monster Manual and sourcebooks such as
Draconomicon: Chromatic Dragons or Manual of the Planes.
You can also craft a monster yourself by building an opponent from scratch,
modifying an existing monster in some way, or creating an NPC with a charac-
ter class. Chapter 10 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide is full of advice on how to
craft these opponents, including simple modifications to existing monsters
(changing its appearance or adjusting its level), templates you can apply to
expand a monster’s capabilities, and rules for building NPCs. 
A master villain is often an elite or even a solo monster, making it feel like a
significant threat even if its level isn’t any higher than the player characters’
level. If you want a villain to be a persistent nemesis, you can advance the vil-
lain’s level as the player characters gain levels, so the master villain remains
a signature foe throughout the player characters’ career. 
What kind of monsters and villains are right for your dungeon adventure? That
depends on the story you want to tell and the level and number of the player
characters. As a general rule, a good challenge for a group of characters is a
group of the same number of monsters of the same level as the characters. 
Encounter level
Every monster in the game has a level, just as player characters have levels,
and the two are meant to be directly comparable: a 5th-level character should
spend a lot of time fighting 5th-level monsters. The concept of encounter level
measures how tough a given encounter is for a specific group of PCs. It’s rela-
tive to the number of characters in the party, and it serves as a quick mea-
sure of whether the encounter should be easy, tough, or darn near impossible
for that group of player characters to deal with. A group of seven 5th-level
monsters facing a group of five 5th-level characters is actually a fairly difficult
6th-level encounter for that party. Up against a group of seven 5th-level char-
acters, though, it’s a 5th-level encounter, a perfectly appropriate challenge. 
When you craft each encounter in your adventure, assign monsters to hit the
encounter level you want associated with the encounter.
You’re going to want to review the information on pages 56–57 of the Dungeon
Master’s Guide. It tells you how to build encounters and determine their
encounter level.
174
Part III: Creating Adventures 

A lot of the time, you want the level of the party to match the level of the
encounter. Some encounters should be easier than average; some should be
harder. Table 13-1 describes the optimal mix of encounters to throw at the
PCs over the course of an adventure. (This table is adapted from the table on
page 104 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.)
Table 13-1
Encounter Difficulty
% of Total Encounters
Encounter Difficulty
Encounter Level
10%
Moderately easy
Party level –1
40%
Moderate
Party level +0
40%
Challenging
Party level +1
10%
Very challenging
Party level +2 or +3
The percentages relate to the overall dungeon you design. For example, if you
design a dungeon with ten combat or challenge encounters, one should be
moderately easy, four should be moderate, four should be challenging, and
one should be very challenging.
If you use this distribution of encounters, the characters will advance one
level after they complete eight encounters and one major quest of their level
(or a ninth encounter). Those eight encounters would consist of one moder-
ately easy encounter, three each of moderate and challenging, and one very
challenging encounter. If you use a ninth encounter instead of a major quest,
it should be moderately difficult.
Monster roles
Just as player characters have roles, monsters also have roles, which are single-
word summaries of the job they’re expected to perform in combat encounters. A
monster’s role is a tool to help you build the monster into an encounter and run
that encounter, sort of a shorthand description of the kinds of abilities it has.
These are the six main monster roles:
 Artillery: These monsters try to stay out of melee combat, using ranged
and area attacks to hurt the characters from a distance. 
 Brute: These monsters stand in melee and dish out lots of damage.
They’re pretty easy for characters to hit (they have low defense scores),
but they have lots of hit points. 
175
Chapter 13: Tools of the Trade

 Controller: These monsters don’t mind getting up close and personal,
using short-range attacks, close powers, and melee attacks to alter ter-
rain, control their opponents’ actions, or inflict penalties or negative
conditions.
Remember that a monster controller, such as a mind flayer mastermind,
isn’t the same as a player character controller, such as a wizard. Player
character controllers generally stay back out of hand-to-hand combat,
using area and multiple-target ranged attacks to control the field of
battle. Monster controllers are more like leader player characters,
although with a greater focus on harming their foes than on helping
their allies (unless they’re also leader monsters). 
 Lurker: These monsters tend to make very damaging attacks every
couple of rounds, with some means of staying out of harm’s way in the
rounds between. Some lurkers use stealth or invisibility, while others
turn to stone or become insubstantial so they’re much harder to
damage.
 Skirmisher: These monsters are all about mobility, moving rapidly
around the encounter area, shifting a lot, and using powers like mobile
melee attack or flyby attack to hit characters and run away.
 Soldier: Like brutes, soldiers stand up front in melee and beat on char-
acters. They have normal hit points but high Armor Class, letting them
take a lot of punishment before they drop. They also have abilities that
help them pin characters down next to them, very similar to player char-
acter defenders.
Minion is sort of a role, but it also falls into the same category as words like
elite and solo, which tell you how much of a threat a monster is compared
with other monsters of its level. Minions count as fractions of monsters, elite
monsters count double, and solo monsters are five monsters in one — a
whole encounter wrapped up in a single hide.
The most straightforward way to build an encounter is to choose five mon-
sters of the characters’ level, using a mix of monster roles. Choose a melee-
focused monster — a brute or soldier monster — and use two or three of
them to stand toe-to-toe with the player character defenders and melee strik-
ers. Choose an artillery monster to hang back and used ranged attacks
against the characters, and use one or two of them. Then fill out the
encounter with controllers, lurkers, or skirmishers. 
Keep things simple by using only two or three different monsters and using
one to three of each one. An encounter with three ghouls and two blazing
skeletons is a interesting mix of two different monsters in two different roles
(soldier and artillery). An encounter with a ghoul, a boneshard skeleton, a
blazing skeleton, a wraith, and four vampire spawn fleshrippers presents the
176
Part III: Creating Adventures 

same level of challenge to the player characters, but if Dungeon Masters
earned experience, it would give you twice as much — it’s that much harder
to run. The logistical challenge alone, of keeping track of five different sets of
monster statistics, is enough to make this encounter unnecessarily compli-
cated. There are ways to manage that challenge, and this could be a success-
ful encounter, but it presents a serious risk of making your head explode.
Simpler is usually better.
The encounter templates presented on pages 58–59 of the Dungeon Master’s
Guide offer quick and easy ways to build encounters using an interesting mix
of monster roles. An encounter with three ghouls and two blazing skeletons
is an example of the Double Line encounter template. Page 59 also offers a
straightforward guide to modifying those templates by using minions, elite
and solo monsters, traps, and hazards.
Terrain, hazards, and challenges
Every character’s powers give that character interesting things to do in
combat, interesting choices to make each round a fight goes on. Even a fight
that’s nothing more than a group of player characters facing a group of mon-
sters in a bare room offers a lot of tactical opportunity, based purely on the
powers of the characters and monsters involved. That said, good use of ter-
rain, hazards, and challenges adds another dimension to a combat encounter. 
Terrain and hazards make movement more important. In a featureless room,
movement is unrestricted (unless it’s affected by powers that limit move-
ment). Characters and monsters can gain combat advantage by flanking their
opponents, but otherwise movement isn’t very important or interesting.
Some kinds of terrain, though, slow or restrict movement or add skill checks
to movement. Hazards make a character’s or monster’s precise position in
the room significant because the position might open the creature or charac-
ter up to damage or some other penalty. Monsters can position themselves
so characters can’t get into flanking positions without dealing with difficult
terrain, or they can take cover to make themselves harder to hit. Characters
can use powers that force movement to put monsters in danger from a
hazard or to knock them over a cliff or down a pit. 
Forced movement is a ready option for many characters and monsters in the
game. That makes a fight in precipitous terrain potentially deadly. Heed the
advice on page 44 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide, and don’t use drops of such
altitude that a fall would automatically kill a character or monster. Falling off
a cliff or into a pit should hurt — in terms of both the damage it deals and the
time it takes to get back up to where the fight is — but it shouldn’t mean
instant death. 
177
Chapter 13: Tools of the Trade

Adding a skill challenge to a combat encounter gives the characters an addi-
tional threat to consider besides the immediate threat of the monsters, and it
gives one or more characters in the party something else to do besides use
attack powers to damage and hinder the monsters. It’s a lot like adding
another monster to an encounter, but a monster that the characters can’t
deal with using normal means. 
The most common example of this kind of added complexity is a trap the
characters trigger at the start of an encounter. While the rest of the party
fights the monsters, a character trained in Thievery (often a rogue or war-
lock) uses that skill to shut down the trap. For this to work, the trap has to
either make attacks every round, just like a monster, or it has to make
progress each round toward its ultimate goal of killing or imprisoning the
characters. The room might be slowly filling with water, the walls of the room
might be closing in on the characters, or a portcullis might slowly lower
across the only exit from the room. In any event, the trap presents an immi-
nent threat, so the characters can’t afford to simply ignore it until all the
monsters are dead.
A skill challenge embedded in a combat encounter doesn’t have to be a trap,
though, and it doesn’t have to distract only the character trained in Thievery.
It could involve negotiation (using skills such as Bluff, Diplomacy, Insight, and
Intimidate); physical feats (Acrobatics, Athletics, Endurance); or working out
a puzzle (knowledge-based skills such as Arcana, Dungeoneering, or Religion).
Perhaps while the characters fight shambling zombies in the ancient crypts,
they have the opportunity to bargain with the spirits that haunt the crypts to
prevent the spirits from re-animating the zombies the characters kill. Or
while the party fights what seems to be a never-ending stream of rat swarms
pouring into the storm sewers, one or more characters swim down into the
raging waters and struggle to close the valve the rats are coming through. Or
the characters must figure out how to close the demongate while more car-
nage demons spill through the gate each round.
In all these examples, the skill challenge involves an immediate threat. Dealing
with the skill challenge doesn’t end the combat encounter, but until the char-
acters deal with it, the fight keeps getting harder. More monsters might join
the fight every round on a certain initiative count, or each time the charac-
ters fail a skill check associated with the challenge. 
Ideally, a challenge that you include as part of a combat encounter should
offer the characters some choices: They might decide to let the rogue handle
it while the rest of the party fights the monsters, or they might decide to let
the fighter hold back the monsters while the rest of the party deals with the
challenge. Any individual monster in a combat encounter offers the same
decision to the player characters — “How much of our attention does this
single threat deserve?” 
178
Part III: Creating Adventures 

Encounter scripts
As described on pages 62–64 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide, an encounter
script is a tool you can use to help you plan terrain, hazards, and other ele-
ments of a combat encounter. It’s not a written script like the text of a play or
movie, but just an outline in your mind of how you expect an encounter to
play out. By taking the time to think through the way your players are likely
to approach an encounter, you can anticipate problems that might come up
and plan solutions to them.
Here’s where you have an advantage over every professional adventure
designer in the world: You know your players. When designers at Wizards of
the Coast or another game publisher write an adventure for publication, they
can anticipate only how a typical group of players, whatever that is, might
approach an encounter. Your players might follow a similar script, but they
might have nothing in common with that imagined “typical” group, which
means they might take on an encounter in a completely different way.
Because you know your players — at least after you’ve been playing together
for a while — you can design better encounters for them.
Think about an encounter script in terms of the encounter’s start, its goal,
and how it unfolds.
Encounter start
Where are the characters and the monsters when the encounter starts? In a
stereotypical dungeon, the characters break down a door and find monsters
in a room beyond. That can work, but it often leads to a bottleneck in the
doorway — a couple of characters and a couple of monsters stand toe-to-toe
by the open door, and the rest of the combatants can have trouble getting into
good positions. Think about how to draw all the characters farther into the
room, even if that means that monsters hold back or pull away from melee.
You can also think about ways to start the encounter with the characters
already smack in the middle. Maybe the characters enter a room and start to
cross a bridge across a chasm when carrion crawlers start worming up from
the chasm beneath them. Or archers start launching arrows at them from an
overhead gallery. Or goblins swarm into the room ahead of them and behind
them. Or all of the above! An encounter that begins with the characters facing
threats coming at them from opposite directions — or even all sides — is
going to be a lot more dynamic than one that starts with a simple faceoff.
If you’re using minions in your encounter, make sure they’re not all clumped
together at the start of the encounter. A cluster of minions is just waiting for
a large area attack from the wizard, rendering the minions quickly irrelevant.
179
Chapter 13: Tools of the Trade

Spread minions out. Reveal them in stages — maybe two are visible at the
start of the encounter, two more run into view on their first turn, and the rest
come up behind the characters in the second round. The party wizard should
shine in any fight that includes minions, but that doesn’t mean that he or she
should wipe out all of the minions in the first round of combat!
Encounter goal
Every encounter has a goal, something the characters are trying to accom-
plish. Much of the time, it’s an unstated goal, something along the lines of
“kill these monsters and take any treasure they might be guarding.” Often,
though, other goals factor in to the encounter, from something as simple as
“get to the door on the opposite side of the room” (presumably because it
will bring the characters closer to the ultimate goal of the adventure) to a
complex goal such as “use the magic torch of blue fire to ignite the braziers
on all four altars (while fighting off the cultists), and then kill the demon that
appears, dealing the final blow at the same moment as the full moon reaches
its zenith, shining a beam of light down the shaft in the ceiling to reveal the
mystic rune on the floor.” The encounter’s goal has a lot to do with how it
actually plays out. 
180
Part III: Creating Adventures 
Structure your adventure for the players
You want to make sure that you create an
adventure of the right length and complexity 
for your game group. A group that meets spo-
radically probably wants to play shorter, less
complex adventures, and it would be difficult to
build a continuous storyline from adventure 
to adventure. On the other hand, a group that
meets frequently can handle the complexity of
longer plots that continue on from adventure to
adventure. Keep in mind that good adventures
include things the players like to do — things
they find fun. 
Whether the adventure you’re creating is a
simple dungeon crawl or a part of a larger cam-
paign, keep these tips in mind: 
 Always include situations where players
can make choices. 
 Always vary the types of encounters you
build into the adventure so at least one
encounter will interest each player.
 Always think of encounters where each
player character has a moment to shine.
 Avoid leading the player characters or rail-
roading them just to get to what you’ve
designed; players need to feel like they
have a say in the direction of the adventure. 
 Avoid creating encounters where the player
characters are simply spectators — the
PCs need to be in the thick of the action. 
 Avoid creating encounters that continu-
ally nullify player character powers and
abilities.

How the encounter unfolds
Think about how your players typically respond to the start of a combat
encounter. Do your defenders charge the nearest opponent, move forward
cautiously and ready an attack for the first creature that moves adjacent, or
make their way toward the biggest perceived threat? Is your striker a melee-
focused ranger or a rogue, or an archer ranger or a warlock? Does your group
have a cleric or warlord who wades up beside the fighter, or a cleric who’d
rather hang back away from the action? 
Take what you know about the encounter and start imagining how it’s likely
to play out. Think about the strategy your players are likely to employ and
consider ways for the monsters to foil those strategies. Your goal isn’t to com-
pletely shut down the players’ road to victory, but to put obstacles in the way
so that it’s an interesting fight, something that makes them break a sweat.
An encounter script is a tool for you to plan an encounter, not a prescription
for how the characters must play it. Your goal is to make an interesting, chal-
lenging, and ultimately exciting encounter for your group of players, not to
make them follow a predetermined (or optimal) sequence of actions to
achieve a predictable result. 
Rewards
The last piece of the adventure design puzzle revolves around rewards.
Rewards include experience points and treasure, as well as the pure player
satisfaction of solving a mystery or completing a goal. Rewards are the
benchmark a DM uses to show the players how well they’ve played and how
good their characters are, based on the challenges they overcome. 
Experience points
Most players are as eager to find out how many experience points their char-
acters earned for the adventure as they are to see what kind of treasure their
characters found. After all, the experience point total a character has earned
determines his or her level. Updating characters who have gone up a level is
great fun for most players, and many will pore over the Player’s Handbook,
carefully reading the descriptions of feats and powers before choosing which
ones are the coolest or most optimized for their characters.
181
Chapter 13: Tools of the Trade

Calculating how many experience points the PCs earned for the adventure is
easy. Every monster and other challenge has a level that determines its XP
reward value. Page 120 in the Dungeon Master’s Guide has a comprehensive
table for determining XP awards by level. 
Treasure
Treasure comes in a number of forms. Monetary treasure includes gold, as
well as gems, jewels, and other things that the party can easily convert to
cash. Then there’re magic items, weapons, armor, and other items found in
dungeons or on defeated monsters and other opponents.
Pages 124–129 in the Dungeon Master’s Guide provide guidelines for assigning
treasure to the encounters in your dungeon. Try to include a mix of treasure
types throughout your adventure. If you give just coins in one treasure
parcel, give gems or art objects in the next.

The Dungeon Adventure
In This Chapter
 Designing dungeons
 Reviewing dungeon adventure structure
 Adding a dynamic element to dungeon crawls
T
he original adventure structure for roleplaying games is the dungeon
crawl. When you want to get started creating your own adventures, we
recommend using the basic form. Dungeons, after all, are half of what the
D&D game is all about!
What is a dungeon? The D&D game uses that term broadly to mean many dif-
ferent kinds of environments. A dungeon is usually underground, but it might
also be an ancient ruin half-swallowed by the wilderness. A dungeon is almost
always made up of interconnected rooms and corridors — a structured envi-
ronment for the player characters to explore, with choices represented by
branching corridors and rooms with multiple exits. Some dungeons are rela-
tively small, such as a cluster of natural caves behind a waterfall. Others are
sprawling complexes with many different levels, such as a series of tombs and
catacombs beneath a city.
Some dungeons are places of legend in the D&D game, such as Castle
Ravenloft, the Tomb of Horrors, and the Temple of Elemental Evil. For anyone
who has played the game in the past, one or more of these legendary names
will conjure images of danger, excitement, and thrilling fun. By using the
advice and tips we provide in this chapter, your dungeons can accomplish
the same thing for your fellow players.
Check out Chapter 17 for suggestions on how to build a dungeon adventure
by using random elements. It’s a fun and fast method for creating an adven-
ture quickly or on the fly. At the very least, Chapter 17 should give you some
ideas on what to put into the dungeon crawl that you design with the meth-
ods we describe in this chapter.

Designing Your First Dungeon
When you’re creating a dungeon crawl (also called a site-based adventure),
you need to prepare several elements to make a complete adventure:
 A story idea
 A map of the dungeon
 A key to the locations on the map
The key to the locations on the map describes encounter areas that are trig-
gered when the player characters arrive there. You want to use all the tools
and building blocks presented in Chapter 13, applying them to the map of the
site that you create.
Plotting the dungeon’s story
Dungeon crawls tend to be linear adventures where the encounter locations
provide the impetus to move the plot forward. In other words, the dungeon
map provides the structure and flow of the story. Depending on the complex-
ity of the dungeon map that you create, the player characters can have a
single path to follow or multiple ways to get to the goal of the adventure.
Here’s that dragon and the egg conundrum: Which comes first, the dungeon
map or the story idea? Our answer is that it doesn’t matter because the 
creative process is different for everyone, so we don’t stifle and muck with
your creativity by telling you The One True Way to design a dungeon crawl
adventure. 
If you start out with a story idea, you draw a map to fit that story and fill it
with encounters that help you develop the storyline. On the other hand, you
might prefer to start out by drawing a cool map, and then crafting a story to
take advantage of its pattern. There’s no right way to approach this; over the
years, we’ve used both approaches in our personal games as well as in pro-
fessional projects.
However you approach the creation of your dungeon crawl adventure,
remember that the main action and most of the story takes place in the dun-
geon itself. This doesn’t mean that a dungeon crawl will limit your creativity,
however, because dungeons can take a wide variety of forms. They can be
carved corridors of stone or natural passages through caverns. Really, any
confined place can be used as a dungeon, whether it’s a cave complex, a
wizard’s stronghold, or a king’s castle.

Part III: Creating Adventures 

Drawing the map
You need graph paper to draw your map. You don’t need to be an artist to
make a useful map. Just make it as clear as you can and make notes about the
encounter areas. If you can’t draw a sarcophagus, for example, don’t sweat it.
Make a rectangle and write sarcophagus next to it (or just “S”) so that you can
remember what that rectangle represents. 
Why use graph paper? There are a number of reasons. Almost everything in
the game is expressed in terms of 5-foot squares. Those nice little squares on
graph paper simplify your job of translating encounter areas into 5-foot
squares. Plus, the grid pattern makes it easier to draw straight (or nearly
straight) lines as you draw your map. 
Here are some suggestions to make your dungeon map drawings better: 
 Larger areas are better than smaller areas when it comes to creating
encounter zones. Why? Because you want to have room for the player
characters and monsters to move around. A dynamic battle that involves
tactical movement is better than a static battle where everyone lines up
and stands still until the fight ends.
On the other hand, don’t make encounter areas so big that they 
won’t work on the gaming table. Especially if you use miniatures and
miniature-scale maps at the table, you want your encounter areas to fit
within the space you can depict for play. A room more than 100 feet (or
20 squares) across is difficult to transfer to a tabletop battle grid.
A good way to think about the size of an encounter area is in terms of
Dungeon Tiles. An area consisting of two or three 4x8 tiles, connected by
smaller tiles, is a good size for most encounters. 
 Wider corridors are better than narrow corridors. In general, you
should make the corridors in your dungeon two squares (10 feet) wide.
This allows player characters to walk side-by-side as they explore the
dungeon, and it provides room for Large-sized creatures to move around
freely. If you plan an encounter with multiple Large-sized creatures, you
want to give them room to move and position themselves easily. If they
have to line up, one behind the other, the PCs aren’t dealing with multi-
ple monsters — they’re fighting them one at a time. Neither the mon-
sters nor the PCs can move around much, and that makes for a boring
fight.
If you plan to use Huge-sized creatures for encounters, consider making
your corridors at least three squares (15 feet) wide to accommodate
these monsters. Encounter areas should be sized accordingly, as well.
 Think about circular paths. We don’t mean round rooms and arcing
hallways, which are difficult to draw on a grid. Rather, as you think
about encounter areas, consider placing combat encounters in areas
that suggest a continuous path of movement. That might be a pair of
185
Chapter 14: The Dungeon Adventure

rooms connected by two different hallways, a room split by a chasm
spanned by two bridges, or a twisting maze of goblin warrens that are all
interconnected. Circular paths allow for combat to unfold on multiple
fronts — the characters start fighting in one area but then have to
change their tactics as new monsters appear to one side or even behind
them. You can expand this concept to think about figure-eights, which
are best if the encounter begins with the characters smack in the
middle. 
The sample dungeon in Chapter 19 includes a good example of a figure-
eight in play. Take a look at encounter area 11 in Figure 19-2. The three
distinct rooms are each connected to an adjacent area by two separate
paths, giving characters and monsters in this area lots of interesting
ways to move around.
Marking the encounter areas
Corridors connect to rooms and chambers in your dungeon, but you can
craft encounter areas so that encounters take place either in the corridors or
in the rooms. You don’t want the players to come to expect that combat or
challenges will occur only in rooms, and that nothing much will happen in the
hallways of the dungeon. The best dungeons mix it up so that some encoun-
ters occur in corridors and some rooms are empty. If you mix it up, the play-
ers will always be guessing about when the next encounter is going to spring
out at them.
Mark your encounter areas on your dungeon map with numbers or letters.
You’ll use these same numbers or letters when you fill in your map key (see
the “Making a key” section, later in this chapter). Feel free to make short
notes on the map itself, next to encounter areas, if you want to jot down
details such as what the symbols you’ve created are or other notes to aid
your memory. For example, you might want to note such things as fountains,
statues, pillars, pits, gates, steps, and other dungeon contents. 
Consider which encounter areas will work best for the different encounter
types we describe in Chapter 13. You want to make sure to include a mix of
encounter types as you design your dungeon. Note that dungeons don’t have
to be huge, with dozens of encounters, to be satisfying and fun. For your first
couple dungeon designs especially, keep it short and to the point, with about
eight to ten encounters of various types.
Also consider the placement of encounter areas and how that might affect
the flow of the adventure. Encounter areas that are few and far between make
for lulls in the action. Encounter areas that are close to each other might
escalate into large running battles due to proximity and monster mix. And
you want to decide whether to include alternative routes through the dun-
geon, or whether to create a single path for the adventure.
186
Part III: Creating Adventures 

Making a key
You’ve marked the encounter areas on your map with a number or a letter
code. Maybe you even used both to better represent the expected flow of the
adventure. You might have made some notes on the map, but you need to
make a full-fledged key to best run your dungeon crawl as an adventure. What
goes on the key?
Set up your key in sequential order so that you can find things quickly. If your
map is labeled 1, 2, 3, and so on, then make the key in the same fashion:
Describe encounter area 1, then 2, then 3, and so on. 
Each keyed encounter should get some attention. You can make these
encounter notes as detailed or as brief as you want, as long as you can work
with them in the heat of the game session. Nothing is more embarrassing
than finding yourself trying to interpret your own obscure notes in the
middle of a dramatic encounter. So, our advice is to be as clear and as com-
plete as you need to be for your own use.
Each entry in your key should include the setup for the encounter, a descrip-
tion of the encounter area, the scene, monsters, tactics, and rewards.
Setup
The setup portion of each encounter entry in your key includes what’s in the
encounter area, what’s going on before the player characters arrive, and what
the goal of the encounter is. 
Description
The description part of a key entry takes three forms:
 What the player characters can see and otherwise notice as they arrive
187
Chapter 14: The Dungeon Adventure
Look to the book!
We include good examples of maps and dun-
geon adventures in various places in this book.
Refer to them for inspiration and to see how to
design them as you read through this chapter.
Chapter 19, for example, features a full-length
dungeon crawl. Chapters 23 and 24 feature
encounters and maps that you can use to round
out your dungeon design. (Bonus Chapter 3,
available in PDF format at www.dummies.
com/go/dungeonmaster4e, features epic-
level encounters and maps.) Use the examples
we’ve provided to make your own dungeon
designs better. That’s why we wrote them!

 What player characters can see and otherwise notice with skill checks
(such as Perception or Insight)
 What’s behind the scenes that only the DM knows
In a published adventure, the first part is covered by a “read aloud” section.
You don’t need to write read aloud text, but you do have to improvise a
description when the PCs enter the area. Whether you improvise or write out
a read aloud paragraph or two ahead of time, make sure that your descrip-
tion of the encounter area provides enough information and clues so the
players can visualize the scene and determine whether they need to have
their characters perform some action (such as making a Perception check to
find a secret door).
Scene
The scene portion of a key entry describes the action you expect to happen
in the encounter. Now, player characters have a way of doing the unexpected
and making the scene play out completely different from what you had imag-
ined, but that’s okay. You still want to have a general idea of what you think is
going to happen in the encounter.
Monsters or NPCs
You need a list of the monsters or NPCs involved in the encounter. (This
mostly applies to combat encounters, but it could apply to interaction
encounters, as well.) This can be as simple as recording a name and noting a
page number in the Monster Manual for you to refer to during the game ses-
sion, or as complex as creating an NPC or unique monster with a character
class. 
You can jot down any stats on your key that you think you’ll need to refer-
ence quickly (such as defenses, hp, attack bonus, damage), but it’s usually
okay to go to the Monster Manual or other source when the encounter starts.
Try to have the correct pages flagged for easy access if you can.
Tactics
Tactics can apply to either combat or noncombat encounters, and they detail
the behavior of the monsters or NPCs. If the PCs do this, the monsters or
NPCs do that. You don’t have to come up with every contingency; just plan
out a primary action for the monster and a backup response if the PCs do
something unexpected.
In general, monsters of low intelligence don’t have any tactics more sophisti-
cated than “leap at the nearest character and try to kill or eat him or her.” On
the other hand, a clever villain with a number of options at his disposal (for
example, an evil NPC wizard) should begin a battle with a plan — an idea of
which characters he wants to take out of the fight first and a plan for getting
away or summoning reinforcements if a fight goes poorly.
188
Part III: Creating Adventures 

Rewards
When the encounter ends, what rewards do you have waiting for the player
characters? In addition to experience for defeating the monsters or accom-
plishing the goal of the encounter, you might include some kind of treasure.
Follow the guidelines presented in Chapter 13 (or page 125 of the Dungeon
Master’s Guide) for creating appropriate rewards.
Adding Depth to Dungeon Crawls
Most dungeon crawls are designed with static encounters — encounters that
don’t affect each other. This means that Encounter 2 begins when the player
characters reach that spot on the map, with no regard as to what happened
in Encounter 1 or what might happen in Encounter 3. The player characters
can arrive at any encounter location whenever they want, stay for as long as
they want, and come back later to find the site just as they left it. 
Static adventure design is easy and straightforward. You don’t have to put
too much thought into how the occupants of the encounter areas relate to
each other or interact. All you need to figure out is what’s in the encounter
area and what happens when the player characters arrive there.
You can add more depth and realism to your dungeon crawl by designing
dynamic encounters. Dynamic environments include evidence of intelligent
organization and cooperation between monsters in different encounter areas.
As the player characters move through the dungeon, the occupants take
actions to respond to the invaders. Perhaps patrols become more frequent if
the player characters leave evidence of their arrival behind them or if they
allow a monster to escape from an encounter area. Traps are reset, areas are
restocked with defenders, treasures are moved, and paths are blocked off as
the monsters work to defend the dungeon.
You can start small, just making a few encounters dynamic. Or you can go all
out and develop the whole dungeon as a dynamic environment. Dynamic
encounters are more challenging to create than static encounters, but the
reward in game play is worth it. In addition to a map and a key, you need to
work out a plan for the dynamic portions of the dungeon. In general, consider
these factors in your design for a dynamic dungeon:
 Defensive plans: Whether it’s the plans formulated by monsters in two
adjoining encounter areas, in a section of the dungeon, or across the
entire dungeon, you need to think about how the monsters react to the
threat posed by the player characters after that threat becomes obvi-
ous. Do they increase patrols and create more opportunities for wander-
ing monsters to encounter the PCs? Do they increase defenses by setting
189
Chapter 14: The Dungeon Adventure

(or resetting) traps, locking doors, and taking other protective mea-
sures? Do they increase the number of guards at particular encounter
sites, leaving less important or valuable areas less defended?
 Conditional requirements: Encounter areas need conditional require-
ments, which are events or situations that trigger escalated responses
from the monsters. A monster escaping to warn the rest of the complex,
for example, can be a conditional requirement. Examples of subtler con-
ditions include the PCs moving a statue, taking an item, springing a trap,
or opening a specific door. What do you want the player characters to
have to do to put the dungeon inhabitants on higher alert status? That’s
what goes into this section of your dungeon notes.
 Time frame: Make time a factor for your dynamic dungeon. Time pres-
sure can add tension and suspense to an adventure. And if the dungeon
changes depending on the time, it comes more alive. Are more or fewer
guards on duty at night? Do patrols move around according to a strict
schedule? Is something terrible going to happen at the stroke of mid-
night unless the player characters accomplish something? Use time to
make your dungeon dynamic.
 Long-term plans: To better understand how the inhabitants of the dun-
geon react in a dynamic situation, you need to have a grasp of their long-
term plans. What does your boss monster hope to accomplish? Does the
boss monster or villain NPC plan to send minions to raid the nearby
town three nights from now? Are the monsters cooperating to build a
powerful golem to unleash on the village? Is the villain NPC using the
orcs to collect the components he or she needs to cast a spell to release
a demon from captivity? Whatever the long-term plans, if you know what
they are, you can use them to determine dynamic actions in your dun-
geon adventure.

The Wilderness Adventure
In This Chapter
 Designing outdoor adventures and encounters
 Taking a look at the wilderness adventure structure
 Understanding how wilderness adventures differ from dungeon crawls
P
layer characters do not live in dungeons alone! Every once in a while,
you have to let them get out of the deep darkness and into the sunshine.
That’s where wilderness adventures come in. However, the entire adventure
doesn’t have to take place in the great outdoors. You can develop specific
encounters that take advantage of the wilderness and what it has to offer,
making them portions of a larger adventure. The sample adventure presented
in Chapter 19 handles wilderness areas in this manner, for example.
As with the dungeon, you can get as complex or keep it as simple as you like
with wilderness adventures. It all depends on your tastes and the need of the
story you want the adventure to tell. In this chapter, we examine the wilder-
ness as a full adventure and as specific encounters. We discuss how this type
of adventure is and isn’t like a dungeon crawl, and we give you some sugges-
tions about how to get the most out of the wilderness in your D&D campaign.
Designing a Wilderness Adventure
You can make a very satisfying D&D game experience by starting and ending
every adventure you run in the dungeon. But there’s so much more to the
world than the dark and secret places that never see the light of the sun.
Player characters need to get out more. That’s where the wilderness adven-
ture (or encounter) comes in.

Do you want to know what the big secret to designing a wilderness adventure
is? Treat it like a dungeon! Outside areas can be handled just like any other
site-based adventure. Sites for the wilderness include the road (or path, or
trail), clearing, hill, forest, lake, garden, graveyard, and swamp. Map the site,
add monsters, and you have an encounter. String encounters together, and
you have an adventure.
What is the wilderness?
For the purposes of creating a D&D adventure, the wilderness is any outdoor
environment beyond the confines of the dungeon. When player characters
leave the safety and relative comfort of the town, village, or city, they enter
the wilderness. In the wilderness, the wild things roam. The maps are incom-
plete, and they say things like “Here Be Dragons” in the large open spaces to
signify — quite literally — that dragons and other monsters are present.
The trick to designing wilderness site-based encounters and adventures is to
treat them like dungeons. Never try to block out an entire trek through the
wilderness — instead, you want to map out and play only the exciting parts
of the trip. For long periods of travel, it’s okay to fade from one action scene
to the next with just a little narration to help progress the story and give a
sense of the passage of time. 
To make an ordinary wilderness into a D&D wilderness, you want to add
some elements of fantasy. Obviously, adding D&D monsters provides a fantas-
tic element, but you can take it further. Trees whose leaves sparkle in the
night, waterfalls that are miles high and drop between colossal sculptures of
ancient kings, and forests of ambulant plants are all examples of natural envi-
ronments that have had an infusion of the magical and fantastic.
The Dungeon Master’s Guide discusses wilderness adventuring on pages 66
(“Outdoor Terrain”), 107 (“Wilderness”), 114 (“Outdoor Settings”), and
158–159 (“The Wild”).
In the following sections, we discuss some of the basic types of outdoor envi-
ronments that you can use in your wilderness adventures.
Deserts
Deserts are dry wastes. They can be hot and sandy or cold and ice-covered.
They are desolate regions where food and water are hard to find and survival
requires supplies, equipment, magic, skill, and more than a little luck.
Deserts often feature sporadic oases, extreme climates that might require
Endurance checks, harsh weather, sand (or snow) storms, sink holes, and
other hazards.
192
Part III: Creating Adventures 

Forests
Forests make up much of the wilderness we imagine when we think of the
typical D&D world. Forests usually feature paths or roads, rivers, lakes, thick
clusters of trees and other vegetation, and the occasional clearing. A temper-
ate forest is one example of this type of environment. Others include arctic
conifer forests, rainforests, and jungles.
Finding food and water usually isn’t a problem in a forest, and except for the
occasional storm, the weather and climate generally don’t present a danger to
the player characters. What makes the forest dangerous are the animals and
creatures that roam the dark, dense places covered by the canopy of leaves.
Hills
Hills tend to provide topography more than environment, as forests and
deserts can both be hilly. From gently rolling mounds to craggy piles of rock,
hills provide an interesting environment to travel through or engage in a
deadly ambush. Hills are also good places to put entrances to dungeons and
monster lairs.
Mountains
When you think mountains, think about areas of jagged, barren rock that rise
above the tree line. Travel is difficult, requiring characters to climb or find
irregular paths up and down the rocky surfaces. Water is usually plentiful
(unless the mountains are in a desert), but food might be hard to come by,
especially in winter. Hazards include avalanches (which might be falling rocks
or sliding snow and ice), crumbling surfaces, and various monsters (which
might be dragons and other flying creatures that tend to like to lair high in
the mountains). Mountains are good places to put entrances to dungeons and
monster lairs.
Plains
Plains can be any of a number of flat terrain types, including savannas, prairies,
grasslands, tundra, and farmlands of all descriptions. Rolling hills and bluffs
sometimes break the monotony of these regions. Food and water, although not
as abundant as in the forest, are relatively easy to come by. Although player
characters can see a long way across the flat expanses in the plains, they can,
in turn, be seen from a far distance — in the daytime, at least, or if they light a
fire at night. On the other hand, even an open plain might contain high grass
that can conceal dangerous predators or gnolls lying in ambush.
Swamps
Swamps, wetlands, and marshes are wet and teeming with life. Set at low ele-
vations and usually along the edge of a lake or river, there’s almost no way to
cross a swamp and remain dry. The ground might be spongy in places, muddy
193
Chapter 15: The Wilderness Adventure

in others, and completely under murky water everywhere else. Although water
is everywhere, it might not be safe to drink (see “Disease,” on page 49 of the
Dungeon Master’s Guide). Food in the form of fish and game is reasonably
plentiful. Deep in the swamp, player characters might encounter the lair of a
witch or a shaman, the hiding place of a dark shrine, or the ruins of some
ancient tower.
Oceans
The first requirement of an ocean adventure is a means of transportation. A
number of rituals and magic items allow the player characters to venture into
or onto the water for a short time (for example, a Water Breathing ritual or a
feather boat), but if they expect to travel more than a couple miles from shore
or remain at sea for more than a few hours, they need to purchase, hire, or
confiscate a ship for their use. Assuming their vessel is well-provisioned, food
and water aren’t really a problem. Adventurers sometimes find themselves
undertaking epic voyages to visit haunted islands, search out pirate lairs,
hunt sea monsters, or descend below the waves to explore the ruins of
sunken cities.
Underdark
The vastest and most perilous wilderness in many D&D settings is the
Underdark — a boundless realm of interconnecting caverns, rifts, vaults, and
dungeons far below the surface. Many dungeons at their lowest levels lead
into the Underdark. The Underdark is the domain of terrible monsters, such
as aboleths and mind flayers, and it’s home to the sinister and cruel drow, or
dark elves. Most of the Underdark consists of natural caverns, some so large
that whole cities lie within, so the landscape is similar to a conventional dun-
geon environment in many ways. Water and food can be hard to find, but a
more pressing concern to the traveler is the presence of all sorts of malevo-
lent and hungry monsters. In the depths of the Underdark, the heroes might
visit a cavern-castle of the drow, venture into the twisted maze of a fell lich,
or blunder into a watery shrine of the insane kuo-toa. 
How to use the wilderness
Often, you will use wilderness encounters as framing sequences for your
adventures. Do the player characters need to get to the Pyramid of Bala-
Tuum? First, they need to cross the Desert of One Thousand Dangers! Do
they need to find the Cave of the Lost Clan? Then they have to explore the
terrible Storm Mountain to find it. These present travel encounters for you to
use. Sure, you could say, “You travel for 30 days and 30 nights across the burn-
ing desert until you see the ancient pyramid rising out of the sand ahead of you.”
But a better, more exciting option is to have a few encounters in the wilder-
ness as the player characters make the journey.
194
Part III: Creating Adventures 

You can even set an entire adventure in the great outdoors. For example, you
might send the player characters into the Whispering Swamp to discover
what has turned the murky water into blood. Or you might have them hired
on as guards for a caravan intent on crossing the Zarven Plains. 
In all cases, treat each encounter as a site or location, even if the area con-
tinues beyond the scope of your graph paper. Use clusters of trees, rocky 
formations, water, and other natural boundaries as the “walls” of your out-
door dungeon. Then populate each encounter, as we discuss in Chapters 13
and 14.
Another way to deal with wilderness travel is to structure the travel itself as
an encounter, by building it as a skill challenge. The “Lost in the Wilderness”
sample skill challenge on page 79 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide is a good
example, but you can also design a skill challenge where the characters are
searching through the wilderness for a hidden temple, following the trail of
some fleeing bandits, or simply trying to survive the hazards of the Blistering
Fen. They might use Perception to find signs of a trail, plenty of Nature
checks to follow the lay of the land, Endurance to survive the hazardous con-
ditions of the environment, Athletics to navigate challenging terrain along the
way, and any other skill you (or your players) can imagine being useful. It’s
still a good idea to spruce up the skill challenge with an occasional combat
encounter (you might consider linking combat encounters to failed checks in
the skill challenge), but using the travel as a skill challenge makes getting
across the wilderness more than just a backdrop for random encounters on
the way to a “real” adventure.
195
Chapter 15: The Wilderness Adventure
One encounter a day
One thing to bear in mind as you plan encoun-
ters for characters on a long overland trek is
that characters are tougher if they know they
don’t have to hoard their resources. If they
know they’re going to have only one encounter
over the course of a day’s travel, they’ll go into
that encounter loaded for bear — they’ll 
spend every daily power at their disposal, 
they’ll spend their action points in every fight,
and they won’t have to worry about running out
of healing surges. As a result, you can make
these encounters considerably more difficult.
An encounter whose level is lower than the
characters’ level is just a speed bump in a
wilderness adventure. If every encounter is 2 or
3 levels above the player characters’ level, the
players will hardly bat an eye.
On the other hand, you can also set up a wilder-
ness journey so that the characters can’t stop
to take an extended rest every night. If the ban-
dits they’re following don’t stop to rest, the
player characters can’t afford to either. If a pack
of gnolls is hot on their heels, they have to keep
moving. In situations like these, you can throw
encounters at the characters on successive
days, knowing not only that they’re running out
of daily powers and healing surges, but they
might also be exhausted from traveling for days
without rest. 

Wilderness Adventure Outline
The following list provides an example outline for a wilderness adventure.
Use it as a guide when you create your own wilderness encounters and
adventures. In this example, the player characters begin a trip to reach the
city of Paragon on the Jagged Coast.
 Encounter 1: The Silver Hills. On the third day into the trip, the PCs are
ambushed by ogres where the road cuts through the Silver Hills. Map:
ambush site, road, hills, and hidden ogre bands.
 Encounter 2: The Forest Shrine. On the fifth day of the trip, the road
enters the Dark Woods, a dangerous forest avoided by most travelers.
Within the forest, in a clearing, the Shrine of the Unicorn has been cor-
rupted by a howling hag. The hag decides to lure the PCs to the shrine
so that she can sacrifice them to her dark god. Map: forest trail, clearing,
corrupted shrine, and the hag’s lair.
 Encounter 3: The Lonely Swamp. On the eighth day of the trip, the road
winds around the Lonely Swamp. The PCs come across the remains of a
merchant caravan that appears to have been attacked on its way from
Paragon to Griffonford. A badly wounded caravan guard tells the PCs
what happened and asks them to enter the swamp to recover the parcel
they were carrying and the sorcerer who was protecting it. “She is the
daughter of the lord of Paragon,” he gasps, “and the item must be recov-
ered at all costs.” Map: swamp, shambling mound encounter areas, and
the mad wizard’s lair.
This is just an example of how to structure a wilderness adventure. Don’t try
to play out every second of travel. Get to the action and run those encoun-
ters, but don’t try to narrate every step along the way.
196
Part III: Creating Adventures 
Putting the wilderness in your dungeon
Another option for using wilderness encounters
is to just put them in your dungeon. For exam-
ple, create an ice cavern, a chamber filled with
a subterranean swamp, or an underground
forest of mushrooms as tall as trees. The world
of D&D is permeated with magic, after all, and
you have every right to put a blazing hot desert
in one dungeon room and a lake as deep as the
ocean in another. That way, even if you and the
other players never want to leave the comfort-
able confines of the dungeon, you can present
different climates and environmental hazards
for the player characters to overcome.

Chapter 16
The Event-Based Adventure
In This Chapter
 Designing event-based adventures
 Using timelines and flowcharts
A
ll adventures have a story. Some stories are implied by the encounters;
others are central to the adventure. In this chapter, we examine the
event-based adventure and talk about how you can set up adventures that are
more complex than simple dungeon crawls. By using events and the actions of
the player characters to drive the plot forward, you can create surprisingly
rich stories that play out through your adventures.
Designing Event-Based Adventures
What do we mean by an event-based adventure? Instead of letting encounter
areas on a map drive the adventure (and thus build the story), specific
events drive the progress of these types of adventures. Events can be off
stage (the player characters might have no way to influence them) or on stage
(the events are specifically triggered by the actions of the player characters).
And in all cases, later parts of the story are “unlocked” or “opened” by the
actions the player characters perform.
For example, perhaps the player characters are in a major city on the eve of
the coronation of a new king. At first, it seems like little more than an excuse
for a great deal of celebration, but several events draw them into an adventure
and keep the adventure moving along at a breakneck pace. First, wererats erupt
from the city sewers during the great feast the night before the coronation.
Next, a mysterious stranger approaches the characters and tells them that a
conspiracy is afoot to murder the new king before he is crowned. He knows
the plans of the conspirators intricately because he was one of them until he
turned traitor. Then the informant turns up dead — murdered by wererats.
Can the characters take the incomplete information they received from their

informant and clues left by the attacking wererats and piece together the
entire nefarious plot before the coronation? 
The reactions of the player characters change the events that can occur, or
the order in which things happen, or both. Event-based adventures focus on
trying to accomplish a specific quest or mission, and the encounters build
upon that effort. There’s usually more to an event-based adventure than
“explore the dungeon” or “kill all the monsters.” These adventures are some-
times called story-based adventures because the structure is more like a
book or movie than an exploration of a site.
The basic difference between a dungeon crawl and an event-based adventure
is that you build an event-based adventure with encounters keyed to events
instead of to locations. The two best methods for plotting and organizing an
event-based adventure are the flowchart and the timeline. We discuss both of
these methods in the following sections.
The flowchart
When you create an event-based adventure, one way to organize your
encounters is by using a flowchart. You want to create at least a few paths
through the adventure so that the players don’t feel that their characters are
being railroaded through events to the conclusion you want to happen. You
can accomplish this in many ways, but we show you one method that doesn’t
take a lot of work and sets up an adventure that feels wide open from the
players’ point of view.
Imagine the flowchart as if/then statements that lead from one encounter or
event to the next. The branches that flow from each encounter can be as few
as one or two, or as many as you’re comfortable handling. Certainly, you
don’t want to design such a complex flowchart that many portions of the
adventure you’ve prepared will never get used. But you do want to present at
least the illusion of choice for the player characters.
Think of a flowchart as a dungeon. The player characters explore each
encounter in the flowchart, just as they explore each chamber in the dun-
geon. They might take the left-hand path, or they might decide to forge
straight ahead. 
A simple flowchart presents an encounter with two choices that each lead to
another encounter with two choices. Then paths lead to one of two encoun-
ters that lead to the climactic encounter. Figure 16-1 shows this basic
encounter flowchart.
198
Part III: Creating Adventures 

So, using an example of “murder as event” to build this adventure, here’s how
the key to the first encounter in this flowchart might look.
Encounter 1: The player characters, while walking through the town of Blue
Oaks late at night, hear some kind of commotion coming from a nearby alley.
It sounds like a struggle of some sort is taking place. A terrible scream marks
the end of the struggle, and the PCs and the night watch arrive in the alley
from different directions at almost the same moment. A body is sprawled
across the alley floor, and blood is splattered everywhere. An examination of
the area shows no sign of the murderer, but the body — that of a barkeep who
was well known in town — has been slashed with what appears to have been
vicious claws. The man’s left arm was ripped off and is nowhere to be seen.
The watch officer says that this is the fifth such murder in as many nights.
Each victim was missing different body parts: the right leg was taken from the
first victim, the right arm from the second victim, the torso from the third
victim, and the left leg from the fourth victim. Each victim seemed to have
been attacked after leaving the Open Door Inn, the same establishment where
the latest victim worked. He also explains that the watch is at a loss as to
what to do. If the player characters can help, the town would appreciate it.
The town scholar, a wizard named Avolid, examined all the bodies and may
know more. The hour is late, but perhaps some sense of this violence can be
made in the morning.
If the PCs want to investigate the Open Door Inn, then go to Encounter 2.
If the PCs want to talk to the town scholar, then go to Encounter 3.
Fill in each encounter area with a skill challenge or combat encounter, leaving
clues that provide paths to the next encounters shown on the flowchart. One

199
Chapter 16: The Event-Based Adventure

way this adventure might turn out is that the player characters keep being
led back to Avolid, the town scholar. This unassuming wizard has turned to
necromancy and the dark arts and is using a troll to murder town folk and
collect body parts for his dark project — he’s building a flesh golem! The
climax encounter occurs after the flesh golem is animated — the player char-
acters must defeat it and its dark master before it rampages through the town.
The timeline
Another method for setting up an event-based adventure is the timeline.
When you build an adventure around a timeline, things happen despite the
actions of the player characters, and there is often a sense of tension and
pressure created by the advancing clock. The adventure kicks off with an
event that clearly appears to be the first step in an unfolding plot. Time (or 
at least, the illusion of time) becomes as much an opponent and obstacle as
the villains and monsters you use to populate the adventure.
What do we mean? Well, there really isn’t a ticking clock counting down to
some terrible explosion, but you certainly want the player characters to feel
that way. The truth is that although you have outlined a timeline for events in
the adventure, you as the Dungeon Master get to decide when to advance the
adventure along the timeline. As long as the players are having fun and
accomplishing things, hold off unveiling the next event in the timeline. When
the players get bogged down, lose their way, or become bored, that’s the time
to advance to the next event.
The timeline lays out how and when events in the story take place.
Sometimes the player characters can do things to delay or speed up the
occurrence of these events, and sometimes they can alter events or unlock
new paths through the timeline, depending on the adventure you’ve created. 
A typical timeline can be simple and straightforward, describing events that
will happen at specific moments in the adventure. One way to do this is with
simple descriptions:
1. The first night, 2 a.m.: A man is attacked and murdered about two
blocks from the Open Door Inn. His right leg is removed by the murderer
and taken away. 
2. The second night, 1 a.m.: The next murder takes place, near the stables.
The victim is found with the right arm missing.
3. The third, fourth, and fifth nights: Another murder happens on each
subsequent night, and each time, another part of the victim’s body is
200
Part III: Creating Adventures 

removed. The murderer has now collected a right leg, right arm, torso,
left leg, and left arm.
4. The sixth night, 3 a.m.: The last murder takes place in the town square.
This time the murderer needs the victim’s head and the brain housed
inside it.
Another way to set up a timeline adventure is by setting the events for spe-
cific times, but building an open-exploration area where the player characters
can investigate as they see fit until the next event takes place. You might set
up a timeline with open-exploration areas between events as follows:
1. Event 1, 2 a.m.: The PCs hear the struggle and screams as the fifth
murder occurs. The PCs may investigate any or all of the following
before Event 2 occurs:
• The murder site (skill challenge encounter)
• Avolid’s magic shop (skill challenge encounter)
• The victim’s residence (skill challenge encounter)
• The sewer network (skill challenge or combat encounter)
• The old warehouse (skill challenge or combat encounter)
2. Event 2, 3 a.m. the next night: The sixth and last murder takes place.
In this model, you set up the parts of the town that the player characters can
explore and the people they can meet to ask questions of. The player charac-
ters can visit these sites in any order, providing the illusion of a wide-open
story and player control. You need to prepare skill challenges and combat
encounters (for explanations of the different kinds of encounters, see Chapter
3). When they have almost run out of things to do, the next event occurs. This
opens up new parts of the town to explore, new suspects and witnesses to talk
to, and new dangers as the PCs get that much closer to solving the mystery.
You can even combine a flowchart and a timeline to make a more integrated
and complex adventure. It all depends on the story you want to set up.
Using Flowcharts and 
Timelines in Dungeons
There’s no reason not to try to design a dungeon crawl adventure that also
uses a flowchart or a timeline. These can add greater depth to the story and
201
Chapter 16: The Event-Based Adventure

a touch of drama and realism not necessarily available in a typical dungeon
crawl.
When you’re designing a dungeon, you can use a flowchart to determine how
the dungeon denizens react to the actions of the player characters. For exam-
ple, if the player characters defeat Palehorn the minotaur, then Tusenmaug
the black dragon puts the guards in rooms 7, 8, 9, and 10 on high alert. A flow-
chart can also be useful for tracking the main villain. If the player characters
disarm the trap in room 13, then Vlanis the Vile moves to room 16 to unleash
the hell hounds.
A timeline provides the same tension and time pressure in a dungeon envi-
ronment as it does in any adventure setting. Perhaps the dungeon is slowly
filling with water, flooding rooms and corridors at a predefined pace. Or an
earthquake threatens to destroy the entire dungeon complex, with parts col-
lapsing as time passes. The time pressure can also be more subtle, as in
these examples:
 The number of guards and patrols increase as time passes.
 More monsters arrive in response to a summons by the dungeon’s arch
villain.
 The arch villain is getting closer and closer to completing the evil cere-
mony with each passing hour the player characters spend lost or explor-
ing the complex.
Try any or all of these options as you create adventures for your game group.
If something doesn’t work, improvise your way through the current adven-
ture and try again the next time. Remember that the players don’t know what
you’ve planned, so if you need to make adjustments behind the screen, go
ahead and do it. Nothing in your adventure notes really happens until it takes
place in the game.
If the PCs get stuck and aren’t sure what to do next, you can keep the adven-
ture from coming to a halt by having a monster or NPC show up, kick in the
proverbial door, and attack the PCs on the spot. The sudden appearance of a
new threat injects some tension into the adventure and gives the players a
chance to refocus. The seemingly random encounter also allows you to plant
a clue on the assailant that will help the PCs get on the right track about what
to do next.

The Randomly Generated
Adventure
In This Chapter
 Running a D&D game with no preparation
 Creating a dungeon with random rolls
 Generating a random monster
 Determining random treasure
S
ometimes, you just don’t have enough time beforehand to prepare an
adventure for a D&D game. Maybe you and your friends spontaneously
decided to play some D&D, and you need to come up with something fast.
Maybe you found yourself with time to kill, but you need a little help to start
your creative juices flowing. Whatever the reason, you might find that randomly
generating a dungeon full of monsters is the best way to start playing fast.
Chapter 10 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide includes tables you can use to gen-
erate a random dungeon map, and you can find suggestions about how to
randomly build encounters. In this chapter, we expand that material with
more advice about how to use the random dungeon tables, example encounter
decks, and suggestions for including random treasure in the mix. With this
information and the tables in the Dungeon Master’s Guide, you can quickly and
easily create and populate a fun dungeon with hardly any prep time at all.
Using the Random Dungeon Tables
The tables in Chapter 10 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide (pages 191–192) pro-
vide you with all you need to randomly generate a complete dungeon.
Note that random generation can have some strange results. Feel free to
modify, ignore, or roll again if you wind up with results that don’t make sense
to you.

Getting started
If you don’t create the whole map ahead of time, you need to pick a starting
point for your randomly generated map. All of the starting areas in the
Dungeon Master’s Guide begin with a stairway descending from some feature
on the surface down into a first room — the place where the player charac-
ters enter the dungeon for the first time. To determine what lies above the
dungeon, roll a d20 and look up the result on Table 17-1 or choose a result
that strikes you as interesting.
Table 17-1
Surface Setting

Dungeon Lies Beneath . . .

13
Desolate cemetery or forgotten mausoleum
14–19
Road, trail, or path with no other noteworthy
structures
20
None; the dungeon was built as a concealed
stronghold underground
When you know what’s above the dungeon, you can choose an appropriate
length for the stairs leading from the surface feature down into the labyrinth
below. In general, the stairs descend from 10 to 40 feet; longer stairways usu-
ally consist of several shorter flights. 
Now choose one of the room designs shown in the Dungeon Master’s Guide
and draw it in the center of the graph paper you’re going to use for your dun-
geon map. Each of these configurations offers several exits leading in differ-
ent directions, so you can’t be sure where the randomly generated map might
lead. The stairway leads back up to the surface and is the place where the
player characters begin their adventure.

Part III: Creating Adventures 

Using D&D Dungeon Tiles to 
lay out a random dungeon
The tables for chambers, corridors, and even chamber features are designed
with D&D Dungeon Tiles in mind. This section describes how to use tiles with
the random generation tables in the Dungeon Master’s Guide.
Corridors table (page 191): Use 2 x 4 tiles for most corridors. If you roll a 2
on the table (“Straight 8 squares”), put down a 2 x 8 tile and roll again.
Otherwise, put down a 2 x 4 tile for the corridor and then a door tile or
another 2 x 4 tile for a branch or turn in the corridor. Use a 2 x 8 tile for the
crossing corridor in a three- or four-way intersection. Use 2 x 4 stairs tiles for
stairs branching off from the corridor.
If you plan to have encounters with a lot of very large monsters, consider
using wider corridors. Use 4 x 4 and 4 x 8 tiles instead.
205
Chapter 17: The Randomly Generated Adventure

Chamber Size and Shape table (page 191): The square, rectangle, and octa-
gon chambers are easy to build with D&D Dungeon Tiles:
 Square, 8 x 8: One 8 x 8 tile, or two 4 x 8 tiles
 Square, 10 x 10: One 8 x 10 tile, one 2 x 8 tile, and one 2 x 2 tile
 Rectangle, 6 x 8: One 4 x 8 tile and one 2 x 8 tile
 Rectangle, 8 x 10: One 8 x 10 tile, or one 8 x 8 tile and one 2 x 8 tile
 Rectangle, 10 x 16: Two 8 x 10 tiles
 Octagon, 8 x 8: Four 4 x 4 tiles with diagonal cuts
 Octagon, 8 x 12: Four 4 x 4 tiles with diagonal cuts and one 4 x 8 tile
 Octagon, 12 x 12: Four 4 x 4 tiles with diagonal cuts, three 4 x 4 tiles,
and one 4 x 8 tile
For irregular chambers, you can use tiles that depict caverns, or simply lay 
4 x 4 and 2 x 4 tiles in an asymmetrical arrangement to make a room of roughly
the right size. Area 1 in Kobold Hall (page 212 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide)
is a good example of an irregular chamber of about 8 squares by 10 squares.

Part III: Creating Adventures 
Random dungeon tips
As your randomly generated dungeon map
expands, corridors or rooms might hit the edge
of your piece of graph paper. You can address
this in one of two ways:
 Exercise some discretion and alter the
random results to produce a dungeon that
fits on the piece of graph paper. 
 Simply continue your dungeon onto another
piece of paper. 
Depending on the twists and turns your dice
generate, a corridor might double back and run
into a part of the dungeon that’s already been
mapped. You can choose to make your current
corridor into a dead end so that it won’t disrupt
what you’ve already mapped. Or you can have
your corridor meet the already-mapped corridor
or chamber. If you’re creating the dungeon as
the players go through it, have the corridor end
in a secret door — clearly, the player charac-
ters missed it when they were exploring the
area on the other side.
At your discretion, chasms might lead to other
levels of the dungeon. You can treat a chasm as
a stairway that eventually leads down to a new
starting area for a dungeon. It’s up to you to
determine how deep the chasm is, but bear in
mind the guidelines on page 44 of the Dungeon
Master’s Guide so low-level characters don’t
plummet to their deaths.
When you use a stairway to descend to a new
level of the dungeon, you can either treat it as a
corridor and roll on the corridor table to con-
tinue your map on the next level, or you can
choose a new starting configuration from the
samples in the Dungeon Master’s Guide.

Door Types table (page 191) and Chamber Exits table (page 192): Most dun-
geon chambers should have walls at least 5 feet thick separating them from
neighboring rooms or corridors. When a door leads from a corridor to a
chamber, or from one chamber to another, use a 1 x 2 door tile as a spacer
between the two areas. Even if there’s no door, you can use a blank 1 x 2 tile
to create that space.
Chamber Features table (page 192): All of the features mentioned on this table
appear in various D&D Dungeon Tiles sets. Most of them are on 2 x 2, 2 x 4, or 4
x 4 tiles. If you want, you can replace this table with a simple d6 roll: 1–2 means
use a 2 x 2 tile, 3–4 means a 2 x 4 tile, and 5–6 means a 4 x 4 tile. Then pull a tile
at random from a stack of the tiles you own and use whatever feature is on it.
Random Encounters
Player characters exploring a dungeon might encounter wandering monsters
as they traverse the various corridors and passages, and of course they’re
bound to face monsters guarding treasure in various chambers. To determine
what monster(s) the player characters face when roaming corridors or when
they kick in the door in a random dungeon, you can consult Tables 17-2
through 17-4, as appropriate for their level.
These tables present simple encounter groups assembled using monsters
from the Monster Manual. Each encounter is made up of five monsters of the
appropriate level (or the equivalent, using minion, elite, and solo monsters),
making it appropriate for a party of five characters of the same level. This
simple encounter construction makes it easy to adjust for more or fewer
characters — simply add or subtract monsters until you have the same
number of monsters as the number of characters in the group.
We include the page number where the monster can be found in the Monster
Manual (in parentheses) in the tables.

Part III: Creating Adventures 

Using a Random Encounter Deck
A random encounter deck is a great way of preparing to improvise. With a deck
of D&D Miniatures statistics cards (or index cards with monster statistics from
the Monster Manual), a small box of miniatures, and a selection of either poster
maps or D&D Dungeon Tiles, you can be ready to run a simple D&D adventure
at a moment’s notice — which can be a great thing at a gaming convention, on
a rainy afternoon, or in the waning hours of just the right party.
Pages 194–195 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide describe how to build and use
an encounter deck. 
In the following sections, we offer some additional tricks to make a random
dungeon more interesting, and then we offer a sample encounter deck
designed for 1st-level characters.
Special cards
Special cards liven up a random encounter deck by creating minor story 
elements within an encounter. The boss monster described in the Dungeon
Master’s Guide (page 195) is an example of a special card you can include in
209
Chapter 17: The Randomly Generated Adventure

an encounter deck, but it’s not the only possibility. To add some variety to an
encounter deck, consider some of the following options.
Enemy: The monster represented by this card is the lone survivor of an evil
group that fought and was defeated by the other monsters in this encounter.
It could be part of an evil adventuring party or just a member of a monster
pack that ran afoul of the other monsters in the dungeon. The survivor fights
both the monsters and the player characters in this encounter. 
When you draw an enemy, set it aside. Draw an additional card to replace it,
and then build the encounter as normal. The enemy appears in the room with
the other creatures, but it isn’t on those creatures’ side.
An enemy can be a monster or an evil nonplayer character (NPC), but it
should be the only creature of its kind in your encounter deck. (That’s why
it’s the lone survivor.) Its level can be anywhere from the same level as the
party to about three levels higher. The tougher it is, the more damage it can
do to the other monsters in the encounter, but it’ll also be that much harder
for the player characters to defeat.
Friend: The monster represented by a friend card is the lone survivor of a
good adventuring party, and the other monsters in the encounter have just
finished off the rest of that party. The survivor joins the player characters in
fighting the monsters.
When you draw a friend, set it aside. Draw two additional cards and then build
the encounter as normal. The friend appears in the room with the other crea-
tures, but fights on the side of the player characters. After the fight, the grate-
ful friend heads for the surface, unless you have other plans for the creature.
Various humanoid monsters or NPCs can appear as friends. Its level should
be one or two levels lower than the player characters’ level.
Lock and Key: The adventurers find a locked door and a key to that door, 
not necessarily in that order. This option uses two cards: a Lock card and a
Key card.
When you draw a Lock card or a Key card, set it aside. Draw an additional
card to replace it, and then build the encounter as normal. (If you draw both
cards, set aside only the first one you draw. Shuffle the other back into the
deck and draw a card to replace it.) After the encounter is complete, the
characters find the lock or the key.
The Lock card represents a locked secret door hiding a treasure cache. The
lock on the door is beyond the capabilities of the characters to open with
Thievery. The Key card is the key to that lock. If the characters find it, they
can take it with them in order to open the lock.
If you use this option, set aside three treasure parcels to go inside the secret
treasure cache (see the later section, “Generating Random Treasure”).
210
Part III: Creating Adventures 

Sample encounter deck
Table 17-5 provides an example of an encounter deck suitable for a party of
5th-level characters. Following the guidelines in the Dungeon Master’s Guide,
it contains monsters from level 3 to level 10, with a mix of roles.
The monsters in the deck mostly fall into two categories or themes: undead and
orcs. The undead also include cultists of Orcus, and the orc faction has a couple
of allied demons. These themes begin to suggest the outline of a story that
holds this random encounter deck together. Perhaps the rampaging orcs serve
Baphomet, Demogorgon, or another demon prince who’s opposed to Orcus, and
the two factions are actually enemies within the dungeon. (That would suggest
that you shouldn’t build encounters using monsters from both factions, unless
you intend them to be fighting each other as well as the player characters.)
Three monsters don’t fit these categories. A carrion crawler is marked as an
enemy, so it will be fighting whatever creature it appears with, but it has
apparently been drawn to the dungeon by the scent of all these undead. A
dwarf, marked as a friend, could end up providing important information
about the activities of the cult of Orcus amidst all these undead. Finally, a
young black dragon provides a nasty distraction from all the orcs and undead.

Generating Random Treasure
What’s the point of risking life and limb in some dismal, monster-infested
dungeon if the player characters don’t come home with a king’s ransom in
gold, gems, and wondrous magic items?
You can generate random treasure simply by rolling a d10 and choosing the
treasure parcel for the player characters’ level that corresponds to the roll.
After you’ve given out a parcel, don’t give it out again — either reroll that
result if it comes up again or treat that result as meaning “no treasure here.”
If you’re using an encounter deck to generate encounters, you can include
one card for each treasure parcel of the characters’ level. (Treasure parcels
appear on pages 126–129 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.) When you draw one
or more treasure parcel cards, set them aside and draw new cards to replace
them. If the characters defeat the monsters in the encounter, they find the
treasure as a reward. 
You can choose the specific form that a treasure parcel takes — the particu-
lar magic item the characters find and whether a monetary parcel is gold,
gems, or art objects — ahead of time or on the spur of the moment. 
In a really random dungeon, one way to handle magic item parcels is to have
the characters roll to see who gets each parcel that contains a magic item.
Each player rolls a d20, and the player with the highest result claims the
item. That player can then choose any item of the specified level.
The characters shouldn’t always find treasure lying in tidy piles on the dun-
geon floor. When you create a random dungeon treasure, you might want to
add a little detail by finding an appropriate container or containers for the
treasure, as determined by Table 17-6.

Even if a monster doesn’t have a chest for its treasure, intelligent monsters
usually look for some way to conceal their hoards, stashing them out of sight.
Player characters who defeat the monsters and traps guarding a room would
be well advised to look around and search in likely places, just in case the
monster has a hoard hidden somewhere nearby.

In This Chapter
 Understanding the challenges of DMing a paragon- or epic-tier game
 Dealing with new player character abilities
 Making high-level adventures feel special
G
aining levels is one of the best parts of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game.
Players are rewarded for their time, effort, and cleverness with new,
interesting character abilities; mighty magic items; great honor and responsi-
bility within the game world; and more sheer power to overcome the chal-
lenges they face. Adversaries such as goblins, orcs, and zombies no longer
pose a significant threat to the player characters — instead, they face more
awesome and deadly foes such as dragons, demons, or giants.
The 30 levels of the D&D experience are divided into three tiers to help define
this changing experience. Beginning characters are heroic adventurers —
they’re already a cut above the average person in terms of their capabilities
and their potential, but this is just the start of their rise to power. When they
reach 11th level, they enter the paragon tier, becoming everything that word
suggests — perfect examples of excellence, embodying a specialization
within their chosen classes reflected in their paragon paths. At 21st level,
characters cross the threshold into the epic tier, where they become truly
superheroic, wielding the power of archmages or demigods.
Creating adventures to challenge paragon- or epic-tier characters can be
tricky, but it’s still possible. This chapter helps you design adventures that
take the player characters’ fantastic high-level capabilities — from flying and
invisibility to scrying and bringing back the dead — into account. 
Understanding the Paragon Tier
When characters reach 11th level and choose their paragon paths, you’ll
begin to see the game change in these general areas:
 Action point effects: Characters choose their paragon paths when they
reach 11th level. The attack power they gain at that level might not be

dramatically different from what they’ve had before, but right away,
paragon paths give characters new special effects that take place when
they spend action points, as well as other class-like features. Suddenly,
characters are doing new things — using at-will powers when they charge,
regaining expended powers when they use action points, and so on. 
 Utility powers: Utility powers begin to give characters new capabilities
both in and out of combat. Wizards fly and become invisible. Paladins
teleport next to threatened allies. Rogues bypass locks — and also
become invisible. Heightened mobility is the most significant effect in
these utility powers — see the later section, “High mobility,” for more on
handling this challenge.
 Rituals: Characters gain access to rituals that can significantly alter the
course of adventures. Passwall lets them bypass solid obstacles, and
Shadow Walk gives them a quick way to cross long overland distances.
Consult Mystic Sages increases the knowledge available to them, and
View Location opens the door to sophisticated scrying and spying tech-
niques. (See the later section, “Divination and scrying,” for more discus-
sion.) Raise Dead and Remove Affliction are almost routine at this point
(though the component cost for Raise Dead jumps dramatically when
the characters enter the paragon tier, to ensure that it remains relevant).
 Magic items: Characters have a greater number of more powerful magic
items. They can use more item powers in a day, and they gain access to
the impressive powers and properties of magic rings. Winged boots, a
ring of flight, or a flying carpet can allow characters to fly short distances.
Characters can have increasing amounts of resistance to specific
damage types.
 Access to powers: When a character reaches 11th level, he or she has as
many encounter powers as a 30th-level character — four — and three
daily powers (where an epic character has four). Paragon-tier characters
also have more ways to recover expended encounter or daily powers
and more access to the powers of magic items than characters in the
heroic tier. On top of all that, magic rings give characters an added
incentive to push on to finish more encounters in a day, because their
powers have better effects for characters who have already completed
milestones. Characters also have more access to healing powers that
don’t rely on healing surges. Combined, these factors mean that paragon
characters tend to push through more encounters in a day before stop-
ping for an extended rest. 
Understanding the Epic Tier
The epic tier takes the heroic fantasy of the earlier tiers and ratchets it up a
notch to become truly superheroic. Epic characters don’t dress in spandex
and fly through the streets of a fantastic metropolis, of course, but their
powers are appropriate for the challenges they’re facing: They might confront
216
Part III: Creating Adventures 

the oldest dragons, most terrible demons (including demon princes), and
potentially even gods such as Tiamat or Vecna at the pinnacle of their
careers. Epic characters are godlike, and they might carry titles like demigod
or Chosen as part of their epic destinies.
The changes you’ll see in the epic tier are similar to what happens at paragon
levels, but they’re taken to the logical extreme:
 Die hard characters: When characters choose their epic destinies, they
immediately gain some feature that sets them apart from lesser mortals.
From the demigod’s additional ability score increase to the archmage’s
ability to use one daily spell twice every day, epic characters have
subtle but game-changing features. As they advance toward their final
destinies, epic characters become highly resistant to death, with powers
that begin, “Once per day, when you die . . .” At least once a day, some
epic characters can treat death as just another temporary condition
they suffer through and recover from in the course of a few rounds of
combat.
 Utility powers: Epic utility powers have even more dramatic effects. Fly
gives way to mass fly, which can allow the whole party to fly for the dura-
tion of an encounter. The cleric’s purify wipes away conditions and ongo-
ing damage, again affecting the whole party. The paladin’s gift of life gets
a dead ally up and fighting again. Rogues and rangers gain some incredi-
ble mobility with powers such as dazzling acrobatics and safe stride.
 Rituals: Epic rituals continue the same themes found in rituals at
paragon levels. True Portal is the ultimate transportation ritual, letting
characters instantly reach any place they can define sufficiently.
Loremaster’s Bargain and Voice of Fate are powerful divinations, and
Observe Creature makes life very difficult for your major recurring vil-
lains. Raise Dead becomes more expensive again, but many characters
have other ways to recover from death.
 Magic items: The magic items of epic characters are more powerful still,
and characters have more access to their powers. Even potions, such as
the 30th-level potion of life, get significantly more powerful, offering
another way for characters to cheat death. Flight and damage resistance
are more common and more effective.
Understanding Specific Challenges 
for DMing High-Level Characters
Two categories of changes in high-level play can have dramatic effects on the
way you design adventures: the increased mobility that characters in these
tiers enjoy and their access to more information through divination and scry-
ing rituals.
217
Chapter 18: Paragon and Epic Adventures

High mobility
When characters in a party can fly or teleport routinely, vertical obstacles
such as chasms, cliffs, or pits become much less important. Instead of chan-
neling the player characters into exploring in a different direction, a chasm
now becomes a road, offering the player characters the ability to travel
throughout its length and depth. For that matter, many horizontal obstacles —
cavern lakes, gardens full of carnivorous plants, lava rivers, and so on — can
be crossed with impunity. 
Watch out for monsters that just can’t keep up with mobile characters at high
level. Many paragon and epic monsters have ranged attacks, even if they’re
not artillery monsters, or can fly themselves, to ensure that they can still
affect characters who are flying out of melee reach. But keep an eye on
encounters where the characters might be able to exploit their superior
mobility, and include artillery monsters or more mobile skirmishers to cover
the other monsters’ weakness.
Even at epic levels, it’s hard for a whole party of characters to fly for more
than a single encounter in a day, but that can be enough for them to bypass
the most dramatic obstacles of your carefully constructed dungeon. If noth-
ing else, though, those dizzying chasms and foreboding mountain ranges
make for interesting scenery for your epic-level party!
Divination and scrying
Just as mobility magic helps characters bypass physical obstacles, divination
and scrying rituals defeat information obstacles — situations where a lack of
some necessary piece of information prevents the player characters from
advancing through the adventure. For example, if the PCs don’t know where
the evil high priest’s hidden shrine is located, they can’t go confront him.
Before they can defeat their enemy and conclude the adventure, they have to
find out where his stronghold is by piecing together clues, interrogating min-
ions, searching likely spots, or generally going to some effort to figure it out.
But high-level characters have access to rituals that can defeat impediments
of this sort just as easily as a mass fly spell defeats a chasm.
The divination and scrying rituals most often used to bust through informa-
tion obstacles include Consult Mystic Sages and View Location in the
paragon tier, and Loremaster’s Bargain, Voice of Fate, and Observe Creature
in the epic tier. 
Fortunately, the game includes a key defense against hostile scrying. The
Forbiddance ritual is the best defense against both scrying and teleportation,
so consider warding your high-level villain’s private sanctum with this ritual.
218
Part III: Creating Adventures 

Making the Experience Match the Level
By the time the player characters reach 11th level, they’ve saved plenty of 
villages. They’ve beaten plenty of marauding monsters. They’ve rooted out
plenty of sinister cults and broken up plenty of slaver gangs. Moving into
paragon and epic play means that the characters should begin to take on
quests and tasks that feel like they’re worthy of a high-level party’s time and
attention.
Raising the stakes
The first thing you can do to make high-level characters feel like they’re
becoming more important in the game world is raise the stakes of whatever
adventure they take on. Instead of adventuring to save a village, paragon char-
acters now deal with threats to great cities, burgeoning kingdoms, or even the
world. Epic characters can save the world multiple times over and confront
forces that threaten the fabric of the entire universe — demon princes who
seek to overthrow the gods or primordials who want to return the world and
the Astral Sea into the swirling tempest of the Elemental Chaos.
A low-level party dealing with a bloodthirsty cult of Orcus, demon prince of
the undead, might face a single cult leader in one isolated shrine. At paragon
levels, the cult of Orcus might be a society of assassins who hold an entire
realm in terror, with the assistance of powerful demons. High nobles and
great merchants are secret members of the cult, and they work to shield the
cult from any organized efforts to stamp it out. When the heroes take on the
adventure, they’re facing a secret society with hundreds of members. At epic
levels, they might work up to an adventure where they face the demon prince
himself. The basic idea of the adventure is the same, but the stakes are a
dozen times higher.
Wowing the players with the setting
Early in their player characters’ careers, players expect to fight in modest,
mundane locales such as caves, crypts, ruined castles, and lonely wilderness
clearings. As the characters transition into high level, make the scenery
around the adventure more and more spectacular. Instead of grubbing
around in a dirty little cave only a few hundred feet from daylight, send the
PCs 20 miles down into the awesome black vault of the Underdark. Locate
your secret strongholds of evil atop awesome mountain peaks, in the fuming
calderas of volcanoes, or in the icebound ruins of a city of giants ringed by
colossal statues hundreds of feet high. The more remote, the better — if the
PCs have to make use of their prodigious magical gifts just to get to the
adventure, the players will understand why this was an adventure no ordi-
nary dungeon-delvers dared take on.
219
Chapter 18: Paragon and Epic Adventures

Other planes of existence, from the Elemental Chaos to the dominions of the
Astral Sea, make great settings for high-level adventures. The tumult of the
Elemental Chaos, the darkest reaches of the Shadowfell, noble eladrin courts
in the Feywild, and the bleak despair of the Nine Hells are breathtaking
adventure locales beyond anything the characters can experience within the
confines of the natural world.
When paragon characters start to feel like really hot stuff, parading through
the largest city in your world to the acclaim of all, a trip to the streets of the
City of Brass can bring them back down to earth, so to speak. When the local
nobility consists of efreets that are higher level than the paragon PCs, the
characters sit up and take notice. You can achieve the same effect at epic
levels by bringing characters to the Bright City of Hestavar, where Erathis,
Ioun, and Pelor don’t just have big temples — they make their homes there. 
Providing benchmark encounters
Once every adventure or two, it’s a good idea to remind the players of how
much tougher their characters are now compared to where they were a few
levels ago. Look for opportunities to throw the occasional weak encounter
into a high-level adventure. If you can find a benchmark monster or former
enemy who once seemed tough to the players, so much the better. For exam-
ple, if the player characters almost got wiped out by a pair of trolls when
they were 4th level, an encounter with five trolls when they’re 11th or 12th
level will show off just how far they’ve come since that one hard fight.

Chapter 19
Sample Dungeon: The
Necromancer’s Apprentice
In This Chapter
 Preparing for this adventure
 Running “The Necromancer’s Apprentice,” an adventure for five 2nd-level characters
 Adjusting the adventure to suit your group
T
he earlier chapters in this book bury you under an avalanche of helpful
advice and suggestions. In this chapter, we give you something concrete
and immediately useful — a second sample dungeon that you can use in your
D&D game. This one is a little longer and more involved than the sample dun-
geon presented in the Dungeon Master’s Guide, and it might take you two or
three game sessions to complete.
Dungeon Master Preparation
To run your best game, make sure that you know the adventure, the mon-
sters, and the key rules for obstacles, challenges, and special attacks the
player characters are likely to run into during the adventure. You certainly
don’t need to commit everything to memory, but the game will run smoother
if you’re familiar with the adventure and its features before you begin your
game session. 
Before you intend to play, read or review the following:
 The adventure contained in this chapter (naturally).
 The following monster descriptions from the Monster Manual (if you own
it): cave bear, choker, kruthik hatchling, kruthik young, orc berserker,
orc raider, skeleton, blazing skeleton, deathlock wight, wraith, and
zombie. You don’t need the Monster Manual to run the adventure,
because we include all the relevant statistics, but the Monster Manual
includes more thorough descriptions of these creatures.

 The description of Fallcrest and its surroundings in the Dungeon Master’s
Guide, Chapter 11. This adventure is set in Fallcrest, but you can easily
change the name or key personalities of the town to suit your own cam-
paign if you would prefer to use a different setting.
You might want to use sticky notes, paper clips, or some other handy method
to mark the pages in your rulebooks that you intend to refer to later. It will
save you time and page-flipping during your game session.
The Necromancer’s Apprentice
When the folk of Fallcrest’s outlying farmsteads report livestock killed, sinis-
ter creatures prowling around their homes by night, and evil whispers in the
wild woods, the player characters are called in to investigate and set matters
right. Their investigation leads them into a monster-haunted forest and the
long-abandoned home of a notorious necromancer . . . now occupied by a
new master.
This adventure is designed for five player characters of 2nd level. If your
group includes more (or fewer) than five players or the characters are higher
than 2nd level, you can adjust the adventure to compensate; see the section,
“Adapting the Adventure,” at the end of this chapter.
The material in this chapter is divided into two sections: Dungeon Master
information and information to be shared with the players. The material you
can read aloud to the players is marked “Read Aloud” and is set in italics.
Adventure premise
In the Cloak Wood a few miles west of the small town of Fallcrest stands the
lonely house of the infamous necromancer, Roburn. Years ago, Roburn
attracted the attention of the young Vesgin Markelhay, younger brother of
Faren Markelhay, lord of the town. Vesgin aspired to the magical arts, and
Roburn taught the ambitious young nobleman many secrets of dark magic.
Vesgin grew proud and cruel under Roburn’s tutelage, and he began to plot
the murder of his older brother so that he could take his “rightful” place as
lord of Fallcrest.
Vesgin’s attempt to assassinate Faren failed. When the depth of his brother’s
evil came to light, Faren threw Vesgin out. Then he set out after Roburn,
intending to drive off the necromancer who had poisoned his younger
brother with cruelty and ambition. But Roburn was gone. He apparently left
his lonely house to the birds and the beasts and has not been seen or heard
from since.
222
Part III: Creating Adventures 

It has been a number of years since Roburn and Vesgin studied together in
the sinister house in the woods. Vesgin grew in his knowledge of the necro-
mantic arts and took an apprentice of his own, Nathar. Finally, Vesgin decided
to return to Fallcrest and exact vengeance for all the injustices he suffered —
and the first step was to send Nathar to prepare his way.
At his master’s order, the young necromancer Nathar crept into the Nentir
Vale and took up residence in Roburn’s old house. Nathar intends to thor-
oughly spy out Fallcrest and the lands nearby, gather a warband of evil crea-
tures suitable for Vesgin’s work, and sow what chaos and fear he can in
preparation for Vesgin’s return. Vesgin told Nathar several of the secrets of
Roburn’s old abode, and the younger apprentice is eagerly searching out
every scrap of arcane lore remaining in the various tomes and books Roburn
left behind when he abandoned his home.
Nathar’s servants include a gang of orcs and a number of skeletons that
Roburn created, which now answer to the new wizard of the house. Roaming
the Vale by night, Nathar’s minions have started killing livestock, terrorizing
the outlying farms, and waylaying travelers in the wild and at lonely spots
outside of town. The folk of Fallcrest suspect that some sinister new denizen
might now inhabit Roburn’s house, but the last guardsmen who went to
investigate were attacked by a vicious bear in the woods and never made it
to the old necromancer’s home.
Starting the adventure
When you’re ready to start playing, read the text below to the players. The
text assumes that the characters have already completed the Kobold Hall
adventure from the Dungeon Master’s Guide. You can alter the text as you feel
the need.
Read Aloud: One evening, as you’re celebrating your victory over the kobolds,
a dour-looking old swordsman approaches you. He wears the silver cloak clasp
of the town watch. “I’m Gerdrand, sergeant of the watch,” he rasps. “You did
well against those kobolds up in the old manor, or so I’ve heard. There’s some
folks in town who could use more of your help. Are you willing?”
Give the players a moment to think up appropriate responses. Gerdrand is
here to point the characters toward the adventure, so the sergeant takes any-
thing short of outright hostility as an indication to explain more.
Sergeant Gerdrand’s request
This is a simple conversation, an opportunity for roleplaying as the charac-
ters get the information they need out of the sergeant. It’s not a skill chal-
lenge encounter, because the characters don’t need to make any checks and
they can’t really “fail” this interaction.
223
Chapter 19: Sample Dungeon: The Necromancer’s Apprentice

Gerdrand wants the player characters to go out to Roburn’s old home and
see what exactly is going on out there. He’s a little suspicious of wandering
adventurers, but he thinks the player characters are probably better able to
handle any trouble they might run into than his own guards or any kind of
town militia.
Read Aloud: Gerdrand glances up and down the street — none of the other
townsfolk are nearby. He lowers his voice. “The farmsteaders who live on the
outskirts of town are worried. Strange things have been happening lately — live-
stock missing, sinister faces peering into windows, and some sightings of orcs in
the Cloak Wood. Early this morning, old Arim sent one of his boys into town to
tell me that someone or something killed half a dozen of his sheep west of town.
There’s an old wizard’s cottage, known as Roburn’s house, not far from Arim’s
place, and I’m worried that some new evil is hiding out there. Do you think you
could look into this?”
Naturally, the players might have some questions. Sergeant Gerdrand
answers the PCs questions to the best of his ability:
 Who’s Arim? “A shepherd who lives with his sons a couple miles west of
town, just on this side of the Cloak Wood. He’s a steady man, and I’ve
never known him to scare easily. Follow the river southwest, then strike
west where the river bends. You can’t miss his place.”
 Who lives in the wizard’s cottage? “No one now, but it used to be Roburn’s
house. He was a brooding, unfriendly sort who lived up in the Cloak Wood
for many years, keeping to himself. He abandoned the place about ten years
ago, and hasn’t been seen or heard from since. Good riddance to him.”
 How do we find Roburn’s house? “There’s a trail leading into the forest
near Arim’s pasture. It’s about three miles from the pasture to Roburn’s
house.”
 Why don’t you look into it for yourself? “We did, but the Cloak Wood is a
dangerous place. A couple of my men were attacked by a vicious black
bear near Roburn’s house a few days ago. I’m afraid that this might be
more than the town watch can handle.”
 What’s in it for us? “If you can drive off whoever or whatever is skulking
around up there and put an end to these troubles, we’ll pay you 150 gold
pieces.”
Quest: Gerdrand presents the characters with a 2nd-level major quest:
Investigate Roburn’s old house and deal with whatever trouble is brewing
there. When they complete the quest, they’ll receive 125 XP each, and
Gerdrand’s promised reward of 150 gold pieces (for the group, not per char-
acter). That reward is most of treasure parcel 8 for a group of 2nd-level char-
acters. (The rest is made up in the final room of the dungeon.)
When the players are done talking with Gerdrand, the watch sergeant points
them toward Arim’s house and wishes them luck. 
224
Part III: Creating Adventures 

Ask the players whether they’d like their characters to do anything else while
they’re in town. For example, the players might want their characters to
stock up on arrows, buy a potion, or pick up special gear such as sunrods if
they have any money to spend. When the PCs are ready to continue, go on to
the section, “Arim’s pasture.”
Arim’s pasture
This is the scene of the most recent attack and the setting-out point for the
adventure. Figure 19-1 shows a map of the area. When the players tell you
that their characters are ready to begin, read the following text:
Read Aloud: You follow the river south from Fallcrest, then take a wagon track
west where the river bends. The track runs past several outlying farmsteads and
herdsmen’s cottages and then ends near a large cottage of fieldstone and turf, sur-
rounded by broad green pastures. You can see that one of the farther pastures is a
scene of slaughter. The carcasses of half a dozen sheep lie strewn about, and the
smell of blood hangs heavily in the air. None of the dead animals appear to have
been eaten. Just beyond the low stone wall broods the Cloak Wood, shadows thick
and dark under the gnarled branches. An overgrown footpath leads into the woods. 
Figure 19-1:

225
Chapter 19: Sample Dungeon: The Necromancer’s Apprentice

DM Secret: The livestock were killed during the night by the orcs who serve
Nathar, who were scrounging around Arim’s farm looking for something
worth stealing. They carried off two of the smaller animals and killed the rest
out of sheer brutality.
Arim and his sons
If the player characters stop at the cottage, they make the acquaintance of
the old shepherd Arim and his two strapping young sons. Arim is a lean, gray-
bearded fellow with a sturdy wooden quarterstaff and a leather sling at his
belt. He walks with a bad limp, the result of an old injury, and he never uses
two words when one will do. If the player characters question him about the
night’s events, he can’t add much more to the story.
 Did you see or hear anything last night? “No. The wind was up all night. I
didn’t notice anything until sunrise, when I got up.”
 Are the woods dangerous? “Never used to be. I’ve taught the predators to
stay away from my flock. But there’s some new beast out in the woods that
has no fear. I won’t let my boys go in there alone.”
 Where does the path lead? “To Roburn’s house, about three miles in. I
don’t go near it.”
Examining the scene
The players may have their characters take a closer look at the dead live-
stock. It’s gruesome work, but the player characters might learn something
for their effort. Ask the players which skills their characters are using when
they study the scene. Skills that might be relevant include Heal, Nature, or
Perception, but if your players come up with clever ways they might use
other skills, you can give them the same kind of information.
 Heal or Nature: A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Heal or Nature
skill check can determine that the dead livestock were killed by heavy
edged weapons, likely axes.
 Perception: A character who studies the ground around the dead ani-
mals can attempt a Perception check. If the character succeeds on a DC
14 check, he or she finds tracks around the slaughtered animals. The
prints of booted feet lead west into the woods.
What next?
When the players tell you that they’re ready to strike off in search of Roburn’s
house or choose to follow the tracks leading into the woods, move on to the
section, “The Cloak Wood.”
226
Part III: Creating Adventures 

The Cloak Wood
The footpath winds through the woods toward the necromancer’s old home
(refer to the map shown in Figure 19-1). It’s a few miles from the pasture, so it
takes the characters about an hour of marching to get there. Along the way,
they encounter some trouble. To set the mood for the players, use the follow-
ing to describe the march:
Read Aloud: The forest is dense and dark. Twisted trees with black trunks and
heavy overhanging branches make the footpath seem more like a tunnel than
trail. The air is warm, still, and gloomy, and there doesn’t seem to be a breath of
wind in here. You don’t even hear any birdsong.
Bear Attack
Encounter Level 1 (500 XP): About halfway to Roburn’s house, the player
characters run into the creature that attacked the town watch — a vicious,
bloodthirsty cave bear. The creature has noticed Nathar’s servants making
use of the footpath leading through its territory, and it’s waiting to ambush
the next person who comes up or down the path.
Setting up the Ambush: To set up this encounter, draw a winding path about
1 square wide along your battle grid or play surface, if you have one. All
squares off the path are considered difficult terrain — a creature must pay 2
squares of movement to enter each square of forest. Ask the players to
arrange their miniatures on the battle grid in the order in which their charac-
ters are marching. You can assume that the player characters are on the
path.
Spotting the Ambush: Next, roll a Stealth check for the bear (d20+4).
Compare the result to the player characters’ passive Perception checks (10
plus their Perception check modifiers). Any character whose passive
Perception check equals or beats the bear’s Stealth check result notices 
the monster. 
If nobody notices the bear, it gets a surprise round to act. It charges 4
squares to attack the character in the back of the party. The characters are
surprised, so the bear has combat advantage (a +2 bonus on its attack roll)
against them.
If one or more of the characters notices the bear, roll initiative. The bear and
any character who noticed it can act in the surprise round, taking a single
action before the surprised characters can roll initiative and join in the fight. 
When you place the bear on the battle grid, read the following:
Read Aloud: Lurking in the shadows of the forest is a big bear with a black pelt
and wide, slavering jaws. It hurls itself at you with a terrible roar, its eyes ablaze
with bloodlust!
227
Chapter 19: Sample Dungeon: The Necromancer’s Apprentice

The Bear’s Tactics: The aggressive bear assumes that after it downs a victim,
the rest of the party is likely to run off. (That’s how the fighting went with the
town watch, after all.) It bounds straight at the last character in line and
attacks.
On its first turn, the bear charges the party, so it can make only a melee basic
attack (with a +1 bonus for charging) at the end of the charge. On its next
turn, it uses its cave bear frenzy power to attack every adjacent character. At
the start of each turn after that, roll a d6 to see whether it can use cave bear
frenzy again. If it can, it does. Otherwise, its tactics are simple — it tries to
claw one character to death, focusing its attacks on its initial target.
After the Battle: If the bear is reduced to 10 hit points or less and two charac-
ters or more are still on their feet and fighting, it tries to run away — it’s over-
confident, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t know when to call it a day. For
purposes of awarding experience points, this counts as defeating the monster. 
Tell the players that you’re going to assume that the characters stop for a short
rest after each encounter unless they tell you otherwise. Remind them, if you
need to, that they can spend healing surges as they wish, and they regain the
use of any encounter powers they used during the fight with the bear.

Part III: Creating Adventures 
Cave Bear
A cave bear is a savage predator, much more aggressive than even the most territorial bears in
the real world. Its fur is banded with black and dark brown, and its yellow eyes seem to glow with
malice.

From the site of the bear’s ambush, it’s about another half-mile or so to the
necromancer’s cottage. Continue the adventure with the section, “House of
Roburn.”
Experience Points Award: If the player characters defeat the bear, the party
earns 500 XP.
House of Roburn
At the end of the footpath lies the house built by the necromancer Roburn. 
A map of the house and the surrounding area is shown in Figure 19-2. The
player characters reach the place about an hour after setting out from Arim’s
farmstead. When you’re ready to move on to this part of the adventure, begin
with the following description:
Read Aloud: The footpath ends in a sizable clearing at the base of a bramble-
covered hillside. A large, rambling house of fieldstone squats at the bottom of
the hill. Moss grows over the wooden shakes of its roof, and its small round win-
dows are dark and dusty. A thin stream runs out from a crevice in the hillside
near the house; the crevice is loosely covered by an iron gate. Smoke drifts sky-
ward from the ramshackle chimney atop the house, and an old oxcart leans
against one wall. The house seems to have only one door, which is fashioned in
a curious oval shape.
We describe the areas numbered on the map in the following sections.
Encounter Area 1: The Clearing
None of the house’s denizens spend much time outside by daylight, so the
clearing is almost always empty.
Read Aloud: The clearing around the house is covered with tall, dry grass and
bramble-bushes. There is a dusty yard immediately before the front door. The
oxcart leaning against the house is old but sturdy.
The players might fear that their characters will be seen from the house if
they enter the clearing, but in truth the house’s windows are so dark and
dusty that no one inside can really see out at all. As long as the player charac-
ters stay reasonably quiet, the orcs in the house (area 5) won’t know they’re
out here. However, if the player characters make any loud noises — shouting
or smashing things — the orcs hear them and get ready for a fight.
If the player characters wait and observe the cottage, no one comes out until
nightfall, when the orcs in area 5 emerge to begin another evening of maraud-
ing and troublemaking. If the player characters fight them here, use the statis-
tics provided in “Encounter Area 5: Orcs in the House” (and remember that
orcs defeated here won’t be waiting for the player characters inside the
house).
229
Chapter 19: Sample Dungeon: The Necromancer’s Apprentice

Encounter Area 2: The Spring and Gate
A spring rises deep in the crevice and serves as the house’s well.
Read Aloud: The cleft in the hillside goes back a good ways into the gloom. A
small trickle of a stream not more than a foot across spills out and passes under
the thickets nearby. The iron grate across the mouth of the cleft is hinged and is
secured by a rusty old padlock.
The padlock isn’t a very good one, but it is rusty and difficult to operate (DC
18 Thievery check). It can also be smashed off the grate by a couple solid
hammer blows, but that makes enough noise to alert the orcs in area 5. A
character could also force his or her way in by wrenching the grate loose,
which requires a DC 16 Strength check. 
Inside, the cleft goes back about 20 feet, narrowing until it becomes a tight
squeeze for almost anyone. Hidden around a bend in the crevice is an old
wooden trap door that leads down to area 8 in the dungeon level.
Encounter Area 3: The Front Door
Roburn gave his house only one entrance. However, one of the windows on
the west side of the house, leading into the bedchamber, is broken and has
become a makeshift entrance for the orcs. (See “Encounter Area 4: The
Broken Window.”)
Figure 19-2:
The clearing
and the
cottage.
230
Part III: Creating Adventures 

Read Aloud: The cottage door is made of fitted wooden planks, still streaked by
peeling yellow paint. In the center of the door is a keyhole that sits in a plate
worked in the shape of a grinning devil’s face.
The lock looks formidable, but the door is unlocked because the key is long
gone. Nathar’s servants simply use an iron latch on the inside, and they
secure it with a stout wooden peg if they remember to do so. The PCs can lift
the latch with a thin blade or a thief’s pick (Thievery DC 15) or force the
whole door with a good enough kick (Strength check DC 18). They can use
the oxcart in the clearing as an improvised battering ram (+2 bonus on
Strength checks to open the door) if any player thinks to try it.
If someone tries to open the latch and fails, the orcs in area 5 don’t notice
anything. However, if someone tries to break down the door and fails the
Strength check, the orcs definitely take note. They get ready for a fight.
If the player characters don’t seem to be able to get through the door,
remember that they can make multiple tries to break down the door with
Strength checks. Also, characters can use the Aid Another action to add a +2
bonus to another character’s Strength check, so multiple characters cooper-
ating should open the door, especially if they think of using the oxcart to
batter it down — but that will certainly give the orcs in area 5 plenty of warn-
ing that trouble’s about to show up. 
Listening at the Door: If any character decides to listen by the door, allow a
Perception check (DC 7). On a successful check, a character can make out a
low, growling conversation between two creatures (the orcs in the larger
room in area 5). Unless the character knows the Giant language, he or she
can’t make out what they’re saying. A character who speaks Giant can
quickly make out that a couple of orcs are arguing about which farmstead to
loot tonight. One wants to go back to the same place they went last night,
and the other wants to try someplace new.
Looking in the Windows: Peering in a window doesn’t do much good —
they’re small, dark, and so dirty inside and out that nothing can be seen in
either direction. A character could easily break a window in order to see into
area 5, but the orcs inside notice (and likely stab or shoot at any character’s
face they see peering in at them). However, one of the windows leading into
the bedchamber is broken and actually large enough for a character to climb
through. See “Encounter Area 4: The Broken Window.”
Getting on the Roof: Characters inclined to scramble on or around the house
can scale the walls with a DC 18 Athletics check. However, the noise of someone
walking around on the roof certainly alerts the orcs in area 5 to expect trouble.
Encounter Area 4: The Broken Window
Characters who examine the perimeter of the house can make a Perception
check (DC 12) to notice the broken window. If they notice it, read this text
aloud:
231
Chapter 19: Sample Dungeon: The Necromancer’s Apprentice

Read Aloud: One of the windows near the back of the house is broken. You see
shards of grimy glass on the ground outside, and the frame stands empty. It’s big
enough and low enough that you could probably climb through without much
trouble.
The orcs use this window as an emergency exit or entrance. A character (or
an orc) must use an entire move action to pass through the window, but it
doesn’t require a skill check. Characters who enter quietly through the
window can surprise the orcs inside, if their Stealth checks beat the orcs’
passive Perception check of 11. Characters must enter the window one at a
time, and the orcs are alerted as soon as one character rolls a Stealth check
below their passive Perception. 
Encounter Area 5: Orcs in the House
Encounter Level 3: Four of Nathar’s orcs use the main room of the old cot-
tage as their guardpost and sleep in the old bedchamber. If the player charac-
ters enter through the front door, here’s what they see:
Read Aloud: The front of the house is a dark, cluttered room filled with a thick,
acrid odor. There are two doors on the other side of the room. Old furnishings
lie heaped up against the walls. A pair of tall, ugly humanoids wearing ragged
leather jerkins stand near a cookfire in the hearth, growling defiantly at you.
“Ah, fresh meat,” one snarls.
If the characters enter through the broken window (area 4), they have a dif-
ferent view — they see what used to be Roburn’s bedchamber:
Read Aloud: This room looks like it was once a comfortable bedchamber, but it
is dark and dank now — it seems that a badly leaking roof overhead has
allowed years of rain and wind to ruin the furnishings and the plaster. The floor
is littered with the bones of small animals, and the room smells of mildew and
old, rotten meat. There are two creatures lying in tattered bedrolls at the far end
of the room, and two empty bedrolls nearby. 
When the characters enter either room, they see one orc raider and one orc
berserker, with the other two orcs in the other room. The orcs have no inter-
est in talking with the player characters and do their best to kill the PCs. 
Besides the door that connects the two rooms of the house, another door
leads down to the cellar (area 6), shown on the map in Figure 19-2. Neither
door is locked.
Surprise: If the characters come in through the broken window without
making too much noise (making a Stealth check that beats the orcs’ passive
Perception check of 11), the orcs are surprised and don’t get to act in the sur-
prise round. Otherwise, neither the orcs nor the characters are surprised, so
you can start the combat encounter with initiative rolls for both sides.
232
Part III: Creating Adventures 

Orc Tactics: If the orcs had a chance to get ready for the fight (because the
characters made a lot of noise at the door), the orc raider waits at the far
side of the room with its handaxes ready. It throws its handaxes at the char-
acters until it uses all four, and then it rushes up to attack with its greataxe.
The orc berserker, meanwhile, waits with its greataxe ready by the front door.
If the orcs weren’t ready for a fight, they’re at the position shown on the map.
The berserker moves up to engage the characters right away, while the raider
hangs back and throws handaxes.
As soon as a fight breaks out in either room, the orcs from the other room
come to join the fight, but they don’t necessarily take the fastest route to
where the action is. If the characters entered through the broken window
(area 4), one of the orcs in the main room runs out the front door and comes
up behind the characters in order to cut off their path to retreat. Similarly, if
the characters entered through the front door, one of the orcs in the side
room exits through the broken window and comes behind them.
Choker Add-On: In the second round of combat, a cavern choker creeps up
from the cellar and joins the fray. Nathar and his orcs found this creature lair-
ing in the house when they moved in, and they’ve taken to calling it “the
Sneak.” The monster isn’t fond of its new neighbors, but it fears them too
much to strike directly at them, so it spends a lot of time skulking about
spying on Nathar and his orcs. Nathar allows it to stay, hoping that he can
use the small monster as a spy and an assassin in Fallcrest. It takes the
opportunity of a fight breaking out to demonstrate its willingness to work for
Nathar by fighting the PCs.
233
Chapter 19: Sample Dungeon: The Necromancer’s Apprentice
Orc Raiders (2)
Orcs are savage, bloodthirsty marauders that can be coerced or bullied into serving a more pow-
erful master. They stand well over 6 feet tall and wear dirty leather armor. These orcs carry a
greataxe and four handaxes.
Orc Raider
Level 3 Skirmisher
Medium natural humanoid
XP: 150
Initiative: +5
Senses: Perception +1, low-light vision
HP: 46; Bloodied: 23
AC: 17; Fortitude: 15; Reflex: 14; Will: 12
Speed: 6 (8 while charging)
Greataxe (melee basic attack, standard action, at-will)  Weapon

Handaxe (ranged basic attack, standard action, at-will)  Weapon
Ranged 5/10; +7 versus AC; 1d6 + 3 damage.
(continued)

Make a Stealth check for the choker when it emerges from the cellar
(d20+10). Compare the result to the passive Perception checks of the player
characters. If it remains unnoticed, it attacks with combat advantage, choos-
ing a character that’s not already engaged in melee as its target. 
Defeating the Orcs: The orcs fight until two of them drop. Then the other
two try to make a fighting retreat out of the room, heading for the door that
leads down to area 6. Remember, it takes a minor action to open a door. Any
surviving orcs that make it out join Nathar in area 11 and fight the player
characters again when they reach that room.
When the orcs retreat, the choker disappears. It hides and tries to remain out
of sight, following the characters down into the dungeon below and attacking
again the next time they get into a fight.
234
Part III: Creating Adventures 
The orc raider ignores cover and concealment (but not total concealment) when making a
ranged attack against a target within 5 squares of it.

(continued)

Treasure: Most of the clutter in the room isn’t very valuable — mildewed old
chairs, well-worn tables, and several barrels and crates of goods such as
flour, molasses, sour ale, and other such staples (which Nathar and his orcs
brought with them when they moved in). Hidden under a loose stone by the
hearth (Search DC 15) is a leather pouch containing 60 gold pieces. (This is
treasure parcel 10 for a party of 2nd-level characters.)
Experience Points Award: If the player characters defeat the orcs — which
might mean that they kill all four, or it might mean that they kill two and the
others retreat — the party earns 650 XP. If they kill the choker as well, they
receive an additional 175 XP.
Encounter Area 6: The Cellar
The cellar seems to be a typical cellar — dank, dusty, and lined with wooden
shelves on the brick walls for the storage of food. 
Read Aloud: A flight of narrow wooden stairs descends from the front room of
the cottage to a small cellar below the house. The cellar is floored and walled
with brick, and it’s filled with the usual clutter of dusty wooden shelves and old
crates. You can see that part of the wall opposite the foot of the stairs is actually
a concealed door, its surface plastered and painted to match the surrounding
brick. It’s standing ajar, and flickering green light leaks out from around the
edges. Beyond is another set of stairs continuing down.
235
Chapter 19: Sample Dungeon: The Necromancer’s Apprentice
Cavern Choker
The choker is a small, rubbery creature about 3 feet tall. Its flesh is a mottled gray-green, and it has
long, spindly, boneless arms and legs. It’s a vicious, clever ambusher that hides in the shadows,
reaching out to seize unwary characters in its deadly grip.
Cavern Choker
Level 4 Lurker
Medium natural humanoid
XP: 175
Initiative: +9
Senses: Perception +3, darkvision
HP: 42; Bloodied: 21
AC: 17 (see also chameleon hide); Fortitude: 15; Reflex: 15; Will: 13
Speed: 6, climb 6 (spider climb)
Tentacle Claw (melee basic attack, standard action, at-will)
Reach 2; +9 versus AC; 1d8 + 3 damage, and the target is grabbed (until escape). A
target trying to escape the grab takes a –4 penalty to the check.
Choke (standard action, at-will)
Grabbed target only; +9 versus Fortitude; 1d8 + 3 damage.
Body Shield (immediate interrupt, when targeted by a melee or ranged attack against
Reflex or AC; recharges when the choker makes a successful tentacle claw or choke attack)
(continued)

The orcs are supposed to shut the concealed door when they come or go, but
they’re lazy and don’t often do so. If the door is actually closed, it requires a DC
20 Perception check for someone who doesn’t know it’s there to locate it. The
stairs lead down to the dungeon level (see the section “The dungeon below”).
The dungeon below
The biggest secret of Roburn’s house is that the cottage in the clearing was
only a small part of the necromancer’s lair. Beneath the hill behind the house,
Roburn excavated a small dungeon where he kept his valuables and per-
formed his sinister rites and experiments. A map of the dungeon under
Roburn’s house is shown in Figure 19-3.
The floors in the dungeon level are made of smooth, well-worn flagstones,
and the walls are dressed masonry. Everburning torches illuminate most of
the rooms.
Figure 19-3:
The dungeon
below.
236
Part III: Creating Adventures 
The cavern choker makes its grabbed victim the target instead. The choker cannot
use this power to redirect attacks made by a creature it is currently grabbing. 
Chameleon Hide (minor, at-will)
The cavern choker gains concealment until the start of its next turn. It can’t use this
power while grabbing a creature or while grabbed.
Skills: Perception +3, Stealth +10
See the cavern choker’s complete statistics on page 42 of the Monster Manual.
(continued)

Encounter Area 7: Roburn’s Sleepless Warriors
Encounter Level 2: The door leading to this room from the stairs is made of
iron, but it isn’t locked. The chamber beyond holds four undead skeletons
under Nathar’s command. 
Read Aloud: Two torches burning with eerie green flames illuminate this large
chamber. The room consists of two intersecting vaults, with four stone statues in
its center. Glimmers of light show two passageways leading into the gloom.
Standing in a ragged arc across the room are three skeletons, each draped in tat-
tered chainmail and carrying a sword and shield. With the clicking and rasping
of old bones, the skeletons turn toward you and advance with swords raised. At
the same time, one more skeleton — this one made of blackened bones engulfed
in flame — peers around the corner and prepares to hurl a ball of fire at you!
The undead monsters have been directed to attack any living creature that
enters the room without giving a special pass-sign (a clenched fist, held
across the chest). Nathar has taught the orcs in his service the pass-sign, so
orcs coming and going through this room aren’t attacked by the skeletons.
Roll initiative for the player characters and the skeletons when the player
characters enter the room. 
237
Chapter 19: Sample Dungeon: The Necromancer’s Apprentice
Skeletons (3)
A skeleton is the magically animated bones of a human warrior, draped in tattered chainmail armor
and carrying a large steel shield and a longsword. It strictly follows the orders given to it by its 
creator.
Skeleton
Level 3 Soldier
Medium natural animate (undead)
XP: 150
Initiative: +6
Senses: Perception +3, darkvision
HP: 45; Bloodied: 22
AC: 18; Fortitude: 15; Reflex: 16; Will: 15
Immune: disease, poison; Resist: 10 necrotic; Vulnerable: 5 radiant
Speed: 5
Longsword (melee basic attack, standard action, at-will)  Weapon
+10 versus AC; 1d8 + 2 damage, and the target is marked until the end of the skeleton’s
next turn. (A marked creature takes a –2 penalty on its attack roll if it makes an attack that
doesn’t include the skeleton as a target.)
Speed of the Dead
When making an opportunity attack, the skeleton gains a +2 bonus to the attack roll
and deals an extra 1d6 damage.
Skills: Perception +3
See the skeleton’s complete statistics on page 234 of the Monster Manual.

If the player characters forced one of the orcs in area 5 to retreat and pursue
the monster closely, the orc gives the pass-sign as it runs through this room.
Characters who are within 6 squares of the orc when it does so can make out
the sign with a DC 10 Perception check. Realizing that the fist-to-chest motion
instructs the skeletons not to attack requires a DC 15 Insight check (or a
good guess on the part of an observant player). 
Skeleton Attack: Skeletons are automatons that attack with relentless deter-
mination if ordered to do so. The skeletons simply move toward the nearest
character and attack. They continue until destroyed, or until the player char-
acters are all dead or retreat from the room.
The blazing skeleton is only marginally more intelligent than its cohorts. It
avoids melee combat as long as possible, hurling its flame orb at the nearest
character each round.
DM Secret: Nathar didn’t animate these skeletons, and he can command 
the undead warriors only because long ago Roburn, their original creator,
ordered them to follow the commands of anyone displaying a brooch in the
shape of a silver skull. Vesgin gave this brooch to Nathar when he sent him
back to Fallcrest.
238
Part III: Creating Adventures 
Blazing Skeleton
The fire-blackened bones of this skeleton are never burned, despite the raging fire that surrounds
its body and licks out to burn anyone that gets too close. It doesn’t wear or carry any gear, but it
forms its flames into fiery balls to hurl at its foes.
Blazing Skeleton Level 5 Artillery

Fiery Aura  Fire
Aura 1; any creature that starts its turn in the aura takes 5 fire damage.
Blazing Claw (melee basic attack, standard action, at-will)  Fire
+8 versus AC; 1d4 + 1 damage, and ongoing 5 fire damage (save ends).
Flame Orb (ranged basic attack, standard action, at-will)  Fire
+8 versus Reflex; 2d4 + 4 fire damage, and ongoing 5 fire damage (save ends).
Skills: Perception +4
See the blazing skeleton’s complete statistics on page 234 of the Monster Manual.

Treasure: No treasure is hidden in this room, but Nathar and his minions use
two of the wings of the room to store more supplies, including a couple of
water casks, several sacks of flour, small barrels of dried apples and smoked
meat, and other useful stores.
Experience Points Award: If the player characters defeat the skeletons, the
party earns 650 XP.
Encounter Area 8: The Cistern Room
Encounter Level 3: The door to this room is made of wood. It’s damp and
sticks a little (DC 8 Strength check to open), but it isn’t locked. Nathar and
his orcs don’t come in here, because the room is infested with kruthiks.
Read Aloud: A round hole in the middle of the floor smells of stagnant water,
and the floor around it is wet with water and brownish scum. On the far side of
the room, an old wooden ladder leads up into a shaft about 3 feet wide and dis-
appears into the shadows overhead. The whole room is dank and smells faintly
rotten, and the masonry is in bad repair — tree roots pierce the ceiling and
walls, and earth spills through the holes. You can hear a faint rustling sound
somewhere above.
The spring in the hillside beside the cottage lies almost directly over this
chamber and feeds the cistern below this room through a hidden pipe. With
this supply of water, Roburn could have hidden out beneath his own cottage
for weeks had he needed to. The wooden ladder leads about 15 feet up to the

Kruthiks are weird reptilian hunters that burrow through the ground and attack anything that might
turn out to be food. The young are about the size of large dogs.

trapdoor hidden in the back of the spring’s cleft (area 2). Roburn had the
shaft built to provide a secret escape route from the dungeon.
The kruthiks lurk in the tree roots and crevices in the walls. When suitable
prey (such as the player characters) enters the room, the burrowing mon-
sters scuttle out and attack. Roll initiative.
The kruthiks are quite hungry and don’t give up until they’re dead or they’ve
managed to down a character — at which point all the remaining kruthiks
swarm the character on the floor and begin feeding. Characters who choose
to retreat can shut the door on the kruthiks, trapping them in the cistern
room; the kruthiks can’t get through the door when it’s closed.
When Nathar or his servants need water, the necromancer’s apprentice
orders skeletons from area 7 to fetch water. The kruthiks ignore the skeletons
because animated bones don’t have enough meat on them to be food.
Cistern: The hole in the floor is a shaft that drops 50 feet into deep water,
which cushions the fall but presents the risk of drowning. A character that
falls into the cistern takes 1d10 damage from the fall and plunges 10 feet
down into the water. On that character’s turn, he or she can swim to the sur-
face with a DC 10 Athletics check and climb the shaft with a series of DC 15
Athletics checks (moving at half normal speed up the shaft).
Experience Points Award: If the player characters defeat the kruthiks, the
party earns 750 XP.

Encounter Area 9: The Crypt
Encounter Level (EL) 3: The door leading to this room is a locked door of
iron plate (Thievery DC 18, or Strength DC 22 to force open). Nathar found
the key during his explorations of the dungeon and carries it on his belt.
Read Aloud: A large crypt lies on the far side of the iron door. A number of
alcoves cut into the walls hold moldering bones, some still dressed in the rotting
remains of their funereal finery. As if awakened by your light, two decaying
corpses stagger to their feet, their eyes glowing red as they start toward you.
Vesgin warned Nathar to never open the crypt, and so far the necromancer’s
apprentice has avoided the temptation — even though he strongly suspects
that some desirable treasure must be hidden within. It’s lucky for Nathar that
he hasn’t looked in here yet, because the stout iron door of the crypt impris-
ons a very dangerous monster — a hateful, murderous type of undead known
as a deathlock wight. The deathlock wight has been trapped in the crypt for
many years, and it furiously attacks any living creature that enters the crypt.
The crypt extends away from the door and then turns, leading to more graves
around the corner. The deathlock wight awakens as the characters enter,
seeing a glimmer of hope for escape from the crypt where it has been
trapped for so long. Read this text to the players when the deathlock wight
comes into view:
Read Aloud: Hunched by the floor, a gaunt, pale figure clad in the shredded
remains of black robes crouches. An evil light flickers in its eyes. “At last,” it
rasps in a cold voice. “At last!” 
Zombie Tactics: The zombies mindlessly throw themselves at the nearest
characters, trying to bludgeon them to pulp.
The Deathlock Wight’s Tactics: The deathlock wight keeps its distance from
melee, hurling grave bolts at characters locked in combat with the zombies. If
characters get too close, it uses horrific visage to drive them back. The first
time a zombie falls, the deathlock uses reanimate to get it back on its feet, but
it can use this trick only once.
DM Secret: The deathlock wight is none other than Roburn himself. His
apprentice Vesgin betrayed the old necromancer before fleeing Fallcrest.
Vesgin imprisoned his former master alive in the crypt. Roburn died a few
days later, so consumed with hate for his former apprentice that he awoke
into undeath as a deathlock wight — still imprisoned in his own dungeon.
Vesgin has no idea that Roburn “survived” his experience, but he warned
Nathar to stay out of the crypt anyway, simply because Vesgin doesn’t want
his own apprentice to figure out how he repaid his former master.

Chapter 19: Sample Dungeon: The Necromancer’s Apprentice

Treasure: None of the bodies entombed here have any funerary wealth worth
stealing, but Roburn himself carries several valuables that he has long since
forgotten about. Around his neck is a fine silver chain set with moonstones
(worth 140 gp) and a +2 amulet of protection. He also still wears a gold ring
with an emerald and the signet of Roburn’s house (worth 150 gp and identify-
ing him as the ancient master of the place). (This is treasure parcels 1 and 5
for a party of 2nd-level characters.)
Experience Points Award: If the player characters defeat the deathlock wight
and the zombies, the party earns 800 XP.
Encounter Area 10: The Secret Passage
This passageway continues on for more than 200 feet, eventually ending in a
thick wooden door on the other side of the hill. Roburn built this as yet
another secret escape route.

Deathlock Wight
This undead creature possesses a semblance of life through the sheer force of its own hate and
violence. It resembles a desiccated human corpse, with tight, leathery skin; needle-like teeth; and
eyes aglow with evil.

Chapter 19: Sample Dungeon: The Necromancer’s Apprentice
Read Aloud: The ceiling of this narrow passage is only about 5 feet high. The
passage runs straight for a couple hundred feet with very little change, although
you pass several spots where roots have grown through the ceiling. It ends at a
stoutly built wooden door, secured on your side by a thick iron bar. A small glim-
mer of daylight peeks around the edges.
If the player characters open the door (it takes a DC 15 Strength check), they
find that it opens into a dense thicket on the far side of the hill from where
Roburn’s cottage stands. The surrounding foliage is so thick that the door
can’t be seen by anyone more than 10 or 15 feet away, and there are no trails
or sites of interest beyond — only more of the rugged hills and tangled trees
of the Cloak Wood. 
Encounter Area 11: Nathar’s Workroom
Encounter Level 5: Nathar spends most of his time puttering around in this
spacious workroom, engaged in various experiments and studies. Three orcs
wait here (more if an orc from area 5 escaped), ready to answer any com-
mands Nathar issues. There’s also a wraith haunting the place, a somewhat
annoying ally to Nathar. Begin with this description:
Zombies (5)
A zombie is a corpse brought to a semblance of life through vile necromancy. It obeys the com-
mands of its creator and fights to the death.

Read Aloud: A piece of parchment is stuck on this door by a nail. It reads “Stay
Out!” in Common.
The door leading to this room is closed but not locked. If any character tries
to listen at the door, have the player make a Perception check. On a result of
7 or better, he or she can discern the low rumbling of a furnace at work,
sounds of bubbling, and low rasping voices conversing with each other. (The
orcs are muttering to each other in Giant, arguing about what’s for dinner.)
This encounter area actually includes four distinct chambers — the main,
outer chamber, a teleportation circle in the lower left, a workroom in the
middle left, and a bedchamber in the upper left. When the characters open
the door, they can see only the outer chamber. Read this text aloud:
Read Aloud: This chamber is clearly a magician’s workshop. Three circles in
the floor are lined with glowing script, and power crackles in the air within
them. A small work table and chair stand off to the left. A passage straight
ahead ends in a black velvet curtain, green light glows from another passage to
the left, and to the right a short passage ends in a door. Three savage-looking
humanoids crouch on the floor near the center passage, looking up in surprise
as the door swings open.
This is a tough fight for a party of four 2nd-level characters. If the player
characters are already beaten up by the time they get to this room, this
encounter might finish them off. The warning sign posted on the door should
be a cue to the characters that they might want to consider resting up before
they barge in to face the necromancer’s apprentice in his lair. 
When the characters enter the other rooms in the area, either during or after
the fight, read these descriptions:
Teleportation Circle Read Aloud: An intricate pattern of magical circles is
carved into the floor of this room. They glow faintly green, and wisps of glowing
green dust blow across the floor in eddies of air.
Workroom Read Aloud: A large work table and an ornate chair made of bones
stand within a square chamber. A box of glowing script runs along the floor at
the base of the walls. 
Bedchamber Read Aloud: A large bed covered in sleeping furs sits in this
room, alongside a small writing desk covered with parchment, a low bookshelf
loaded with jumbled tomes and scrolls, and a large trunk. A fireplace blazes in
one wall, and two tapestries hang from the other walls. One depicts a sage in his
tower, and the other shows a starry night.
Starting the Fight: The orcs are engaged in conversation, but they’re ready
for a fight. They shout a warning to Nathar as soon as they see the charac-
ters. Roll initiative for everyone in the encounter normally, without a surprise
round, but Nathar and the wraith spend their first actions getting to the fight.
244
Part III: Creating Adventures 

245
Chapter 19: Sample Dungeon: The Necromancer’s Apprentice
The orcs are standing in the squares marked “O” when the fight begins; the
wraith is in the square marked “W” (in the chamber on the lower left); and
Nathar is in the square marked “N” (in his study, in the center left).
Tactics: The orcs stay in the front chamber and try to keep the player charac-
ters hemmed in this side of the room. They fight with their axes, and unlike
the orcs up in area 5, all three fight to the death — Nathar is watching them,
after all. 
Nathar throws aside the velvet curtain when the orcs shout their alarm and
scowls with rage and frustration at what he considers a petty interruption.
He throws spells from the doorway until he is seriously threatened, and then
he ducks back behind the curtain and retreats to his bedchamber in the
upper left. He drinks his potion of healing in the safety of that chamber and
then returns to the battle through either door. Nathar is quite proud and arro-
gant and won’t consider surrender — he fears the revenge that his master
Vesgin might exact if he gives up too easily.
The wraith is the hollow remnant of Roburn’s first apprentice, a man named
Therun. Vesgin killed Therun to secure his place as Roburn’s favored appren-
tice, and Therun’s spirit has haunted the house since. First Roburn, then
Vesgin, and now Nathar have tried to tame the wraith and bring it under con-
trol, with limited success. It fights the player characters, but when it’s in the
same room as Nathar, it mocks the necromancer’s apprentice, its hollow
voice whispering about how it will one day attack him just as it is attacking
the characters. When it’s bloodied, it starts describing how the characters
will kill Nathar as they are killing it.
Magic Circles: A creature standing inside any of the three magic circles in the
outer chamber gains a +1 bonus to all its defenses while it remains in the
circle. 
The teleportation circle in the lower-left chamber has no effect on creatures
within it. It’s used for rituals such as Linked Portal, which allow higher-level
casters to teleport from one such circle to another. A character trained in
Arcana can transcribe the sigils from this circle that would allow him or her
to teleport back to this circle from another location, but Linked Portal is an
8th-level ritual, so this circle is unlikely to be much use to the characters.
The runes in the workroom give a character inside the room a +2 bonus on
any Arcana check made while in the room. It’s useful for research and per-
forming rituals, but not much else.
Treasure: The trunk in the bedchamber contains an assortment of traveling
clothes and other elements of a well-to-do wizard’s wardrobe. None are par-
ticularly valuable. However, the trunk has a secret compartment (Perception
DC 15) that conceals a pouch with 140 gold pieces.

In the middle of the writing desk is a letter from Nathar to Vesgin, which
reads:
Master Vesgin:
As you have instructed, I have established myself in the house of your one-
time mentor, Roburn. I discovered several interesting texts in the secret
workshop below the house and have found them quite elucidating. In the
meantime, I have made a small beginning toward gathering about me such
servants as you may find useful when you make your return to Fallcrest. The
orcs are filthy savages, but they are hungry for the chance to fall on the
town. I think they will do nicely.
I trust you received Roburn’s map to the Temple of Yellow Skulls? I made a
copy for myself in case some misfortune befell your messenger. I shall for-
ward it at once if you did not receive the original.
Eagerly awaiting your next instructions,
Your obedient servant,
Nathar

Below the letter is a hand-drawn map, which shows the location of a place
marked “Temple of Yellow Skulls.” The map, and the evil shrine whose loca-
tion it reveals, are not described in this sample adventure. Feel free to use
this as a stepping-stone to an adventure you design yourself, which may or
may not involve more of Vesgin’s minions, or perhaps even the original necro-
mancer’s apprentice himself.
Most of the books on the bookshelf deal with magical theory and necroman-
tic studies, and a few actually contain rituals. Characters who search the
books carefully (over the course of an extended rest) find the Brew Potion,
Magic Circle, and Silence rituals.
Wraith
A wraith is an undead spirit infused with the essence of the Shadowfell. Its touch causes weakness,
and a creature it kills rises as a new wraith. 
Wraith
Level 5 Lurker
Medium shadow humanoid (undead) XP: 200
Initiative: +10
Senses: Perception +2, darkvision
HP: 37; Bloodied: 18
Regeneration 5 (if the wraith takes radiant damage, regeneration is negated until the end of its
next turn)
AC: 16; Fortitude: 13; Reflex: 16; Will: 14
Immune: Disease, poison; Resist: 10 necrotic, insubstantial (half damage from all attacks);
Vulnerable: 5 radiant (see also regeneration)
Speed: fly 6 (hover), phasing; see also shadow glide. Phasing means that the wraith can move
through obstacles and even creatures (provoking opportunity attacks as normal), but it must
end its movement in an unoccupied space.
Shadow Touch (melee basic attack, standard action, at-will)  Necrotic
+8 versus Reflex; 1d6 + 4 necrotic damage, and the target is weakened (save ends). (A
weakened character deals half damage with all attacks.)
Combat Advantage: The wraith deals an extra 1d6 necrotic damage against any target it has
combat advantage against.
Shadow Glide (move action, encounter)
The wraith shifts 6 squares.
Spawn Wraith: Any humanoid killed by a wraith rises as a free-willed wraith at the start of its
creator’s next turn, appearing in the space where it died (or in the nearest unoccupied space).
Raising the slain creature (using the Raise Dead ritual) does not destroy the spawned wraith.
Skills: Perception +2, Stealth +11
See the wraith’s complete statistics on page 266 of the Monster Manual.

Nathar’s magic armor is treasure parcel 4 for a 2nd-level party. The gold in
the trunk and the three rituals in the books (using their market price) consti-
tute treasure parcels 6, 7, and 9. The total value of the gold and rituals is 540
gp — 140 gp in coins, 75 gp each for the Brew Potion and Silence rituals, and
250 gp for the Magic Circle ritual — which is a little more than the total value
of those three parcels. (The extra 20 gp makes up the shortfall in Sergeant
Gerdrand’s promised quest reward.) It’s perfectly fine, in your own dungeons,
to add the value of different parcels together like this and split it up however

Nathar, Apprentice to Vesgin
Nathar is a short, saturnine fellow with a swarthy complexion, a short stiff beard, and a perpetu-
ally sour look to his face. He wears robes of black and carries a large, wavy-bladed dagger at his

Possessions: Nathar wears +1 fireburst cloth armor and has a potion of healing. His magic armor’s
property makes him always succeed on saving throws against ongoing fire damage, and its power
is the fireburst armor power detailed above. When he drinks his potion of healing, he spends his
one healing surge and regains 10 hit points.

you want. And don’t be afraid to use rituals and other valuable goods as trea-
sure, as long as they’re things that the characters will either want to keep or
easily be able to sell.
Experience Points Award: If the player characters defeat Nathar, the wraith,
and the three orcs, the party earns 1,025 XP. Add another 175 XP for each orc
berserker or 150 XP for each orc raider from area 5 that is present for the
battle.
Concluding the adventure
After the player characters defeat Nathar and his orcs, the mischief around
Fallcrest’s western farmsteads comes to an end — for now. Sergeant Gerdrand
of the town watch makes good on his promised payment of 150 gp. The char-
acters receive experience points (125 XP each) for completing their major
quest. Moreover, Gerdrand assembles a large company of townsfolk and mili-
tia to march up to Roburn’s house, block up the entrance to the cellar dun-
geon with rubble, and then burn the house down over the place, just to make
sure that no other evil creature finds a lair there.
If the player characters show Gerdrand the letter from Nathar to Vesgin, the
sergeant immediately recognizes the name of Lord Markelhay’s sinister
younger brother. He arranges an interview for the player characters with
Lord Faren, who questions them closely about everything they found in and
around Roburn’s house. (This is a great opportunity for the players to have
some fun relating the tales of their own cleverness, bravery, and luck, if
they’re so inclined.) In return, Lord Faren fills in the players on the story of
Roburn, Vesgin’s fall into evil, and his brother’s flight from justice — so feel
free to sum up the back story outlined in the “Adventure premise” section for
the players.
As for what comes next, that’s up to you. You can use the map that the player
characters find in area 11 to point the players toward a new adventure of
your own devising; feel free to change the Temple of Yellow Skulls into any-
thing else you need to describe the dungeon you’d like the player characters
to explore. 
Adapting the Adventure
In Chapter 7, we discuss some ways to make changes to a published adven-
ture to make it a better fit for your group of players and their characters. You
can certainly apply those principles to this adventure. The following sections
provide a few suggestions.

Adjusting for group size and level
“The Necromancer’s Apprentice” adventure should be reasonably challenging
for a party of five 2nd-level characters. Some encounters will be easier than
others, but they should all present a good challenge. However, if you have
more or fewer than five player characters in the party or if the characters
aren’t 2nd level, you can scale the encounters accordingly:
 Bear Attack: You can replace the bear with a pack of gray wolves to
make adjusting the encounter easier. Four gray wolves is worth the same
amount of experience points as the cave bear, and you can use more or
fewer wolves to suit your group. For a higher-level party (at least 6th
level), you could use a dire bear instead of a cave bear.
 Encounter Area 5: Orcs in the House: You can add or subtract orcs to
scale the encounter for a different party. You could replace the orcs with
gnolls for a higher-level party.
 Encounter Area 7: Roburn’s Sleepless Warriors: Add or remove skele-
tons to adjust the encounter difficulty. For a smaller group, you could
use decrepit skeleton minions in place of the normal skeletons, keeping
the blazing skeleton in place. For a higher-level group, use boneshard
skeletons.
 Encounter Area 8: Cistern Room: Add or remove kruthiks, or change
hatchlings to young or young to adults.
 Encounter Area 9: The Crypt: Add or remove zombies, use zombie min-
ions instead of regular zombies, or use chillborn zombies or even
zombie hulks to challenge more powerful characters. The deathlock
wight could become a battle wight or a flameskull in a tougher
encounter.
 Encounter Area 11: Nathar’s Workroom: Add or remove orcs. You can
adjust Nathar’s level up or down, giving him +1 or –1 to his attack rolls
and defenses for each level, plus or minus 6 hit points per level, and plus
or minus 1 damage for each two levels. (See page 174 in the Dungeon
Master’s Guide for more on altering a monster’s level.) 
Adjusting for player motivations
Unlike “Kobold Hall” in the Dungeon Master’s Guide, “The Necromancer’s
Apprentice” is designed to include elements that will appeal to a variety of
players with different motivations. Even so, if your group has strong prefer-
ences toward certain styles of play, you could make some adjustments to
account for them.
250
Part III: Creating Adventures 

251
Chapter 19: Sample Dungeon: The Necromancer’s Apprentice
 Actors: The characters have a chance to interact with Sergeant
Gerdrand at the beginning and end of the adventure, and with Arim the
farmer near the beginning as well, but when they reach Roburn’s house,
it’s pretty much hacking and slashing from that point on. Add some
appeal to actors by roleplaying the orcs as less than perfectly loyal min-
ions. Maybe the player characters can talk their way past the orcs in
Encounter Area 5, or persuade the orcs in Encounter Area 11 to desert
Nathar and leave the area for good. Better still, you could make the
wraith in area 11 a skill challenge rather than a combat challenge. With
four successful skill checks (using skills such as Diplomacy, Bluff,
Intimidate, Religion, or History against a baseline DC of 12), the charac-
ters might persuade the wraith to help them kill Nathar instead of fight-
ing them.
 Explorers: There’s a pretty interesting story behind Roburn’s house, but
it’s mostly invisible to the characters until they find Nathar’s letter in
what could very well be the last encounter of the adventure. You could
offer more to engage explorer players by dropping more hints about this
story earlier in the adventure. Gerdrand reveals a bit about Roburn;
Arim could reveal a little more. The orcs could drop hints about their
master’s identity, even if it’s just his name. 
 Instigators: Be ready to think on your feet when you have instigators in
your group. They’ll want to know details of the furnishings in Roburn’s
old house, particularly anything they might be able to throw at the orcs
or use to create difficult terrain. They’ll want to know what happens
when they push Nathar into his fireplace (suggestion: he takes 1d10 fire
damage, plus 1d10 fire damage when he starts his turn in the fireplace). 
 Power gamers: There should be plenty of combat in this adventure to
engage the power gamers in your group. You might want to step up the
rewards slightly — this adventure doesn’t give out treasure parcels 2 
or 3 for 2nd-level characters, which are both magic items that power
gamers will miss. See the later section, “Adding encounters and trea-
sure,” for more advice.
 Slayers: Plenty of tough combat encounters already make this adventure
appealing to slayers. You might want to pick up the pace through the
party’s interactions with Gerdrand and Arim at the start of the adven-
ture if your group is anxious to get to the slaying.
 Storytellers: Look for ways to hook your storyteller players directly into
the plot of this adventure. Gerdrand doesn’t have to be the party’s only
source of information about the events leading to the adventure. One or
more of the characters might have personal connections to the events
leading up to Vesgin’s departure from the area, including his attack on
his brother and his murder of Roburn’s other apprentice, Therun. One of
the characters might even be one of Arim’s sons, or the child of a neigh-
boring farmer. You might introduce minor quests to give these charac-
ters concrete goals parallel to the main plot of the adventure.

 Thinkers: The magic circles in Encounter Area 11 are practically begging
for a puzzle element to appeal to thinker players. It could be a puzzle
that they work out after they’ve defeated Nathar and the other dangers,
or maybe it’s an in-combat puzzle that changes the effects of standing in
the circles depending on how many circles are occupied, by whom, and
perhaps in what order. 
 Watchers: Our advice from Chapter 7 applies here as well: Remember
that it’s okay to let the watcher watch, but reward all the players when
they’re actively and creatively engaged with the game.
Adding encounters and treasure
As it stands, if the characters start this adventure with 1,000 XP (just enough
to be 2nd level), they won’t earn quite enough to reach 3rd level. The combi-
nation of all the encounter XP rewards and the major quest Gerdrand gave
them comes to 5,075 XP, or 1,015 XP per character, which is a bit shy of the
1,250 XP they need to gain a new level. If you want to expand the adventure a
bit, you can use encounters from Chapter 23 or create your own encounters,
setting them in or near Roburn’s old house. Perhaps Nathar has a few more
orc servants that the characters meet on the road, or a pack of wolves
afflicted by the same madness that drove the bear to attack the town watch
assaults the PCs as they leave the house. 
Whether you add encounters to the adventure or not, keep an eye on the
characters’ XP total. If they reach 3rd level before the end of this adventure,
you might want to add the two missing treasure parcels (parcels 2 and 3)
somewhere in the adventure to make sure that the characters keep up with
the magic items they should get. Of course, you can always add those in to
later adventures — better late than never!

Building a
Campaign

In this part . . .
O
kay, you’ve made your own adventure. The next step
for the renaissance Dungeon Master is to turn his or
her game into a campaign. In this section, we discuss how
to build a campaign, how to move from unrelated adven-
tures into a campaign format with ease and elegance, and
how to slowly grow the scope of your campaign. After all,
Rome wasn’t built in a day, and neither should your cam-
paign be built in one session!

 Using what the players give you
 Converting a campaign from a previous edition of D&D
M
aybe you’ve run a few games of D&D for your game group. Now you
want to start shaping those early sessions into the beginning of an
ongoing campaign. Sure, you could start over and plan the campaign from the
beginning, but why go to that trouble if you’ve been having fun and the play-
ers have grown fond of their characters? Those early adventures could have
been unrelated to the Big Story you want to start building, or you can find
dangling plot threads (such as an escaped villain) that you can weave into
the Big Story. 
Suppose a goblin warrior escaped in one of your first adventures. The player
characters probably were bummed by the fact that one of the monsters got
away, but more than likely they didn’t give it a second thought after the next
encounter or adventure began. What if that goblin warrior makes a deal with
an evil wizard or a demon, or what if he just happened to be the son of the
goblin chieftain? When he shows up again, more powerful, better equipped,
and leading a war band of dangerous goblins, the player characters are going
to be shocked, amazed, and sure that you planned the whole thing from the
beginning. In their eyes, you’re the best Dungeon Master ever! And that’s just
the way it should be.
But how do you build a continuous story for your D&D campaign? Really, you
do it by adding recurring elements one adventure at a time. You might have
the exact picture in your head of where you want the campaign to go, or you
might decide to figure it out along the way, but if you take it one step at a
time, before you know it, you’ll have a campaign developing that keeps the
players guessing and coming back each session to see what happens next.

Building a Campaign
The term campaign refers to the ongoing game created by the Dungeon
Master and his or her fellow players. It follows the linked adventures of a
group of player characters. A campaign can have a single ongoing storyline,
such as the quest to overthrow an evil kingdom, to save the peaceful lands
from the ravages of an escalating war, or to destroy a terrible artifact from
another realm. Then again, a campaign might follow several shorter plots, as
long as the setting and player characters remain more or less the same. 
A good campaign requires a bit more than simply stringing adventures
together. The following sections examine some of the details you should con-
sider as you plan out your D&D campaign.

The core rulebooks for the D&D game suggest a world set in an era of
medieval technology, where magic works and monsters are real. As you
create your own campaign world, you’ll add details to this world. Whether
you create everything yourself, use an existing campaign setting (such as
FORGOTTEN REALMS or EBERRON), or mix and match between the two, a campaign
is more than a backdrop or a series of related adventures. It’s everything in
your world except for the player characters. A well-run campaign seems to
unfold around the player characters, making them feel a part of something
real and exciting. 
Consistency is the key to a good campaign. When the player characters
return to a town for supplies and to rest, they should recognize the place and
the people that inhabit it. After you’ve established a level of consistency,
making occasional changes keeps the campaign vibrant and alive. If the
player characters come back to find that their favorite inn is now being run
by the daughter of their old friend the innkeeper, they experience a change
that doesn’t really affect them directly but makes them feel as though their
characters exist in a living world.
Using context
You need to decide the context in which the player characters are placed.
The context doesn’t need to be obvious right from the beginning (and if
you’re approaching this after a few sessions, it probably isn’t), but after you
figure it out, you can more easily design adventures and set goals for the
campaign. What’s the setting of your campaign? Will your adventures center
around a frontier town surrounded by monster-infested wilderness? Is there
256
Part IV: Building a Campaign 

one gigantic dungeon that the player characters will explore for the first five
or ten levels of their adventuring careers? Or do you expect to present the
heroes with a campaign that features mystery, intrigue, and skullduggery in a
great, decadent city oppressed by evil wizards?
Context might relate to the player characters. Are they mercenaries, or do they
work for a patron? Are they freelance adventurers in it for the gold and excite-
ment, or do they have a larger sense of purpose that sends them into the dun-
geon every week? The initial context you create might have to evolve based on
the decisions the players make when roleplaying their characters. (See the sec-
tion, “Building on What the Players Give You,” later in this chapter.)
The best way to maintain the context and build upon it is to be consistent. To
keep your campaign consistent, you need to take notes. Be consistent on
names, places, and details — both large and small. If the barmaid the PCs
meet at the Open Door Inn is Lani one week and Kati the next, the illusion of a
consistent and real world is broken. If the bell over the door to the general
store jingles when the PCs enter the first time, it should jingle every time —
unless you have a reason for making a change. 
Another way to give your campaign a sense of reality is by keeping track of
time. Track the passing of seasons, the change in the weather, the coming
and going of holidays, the schedule of caravans — building a calendar for
your campaign helps the players feel like their characters are adventuring in
a world that could be real.
Along with the passage of time, use change to show that your campaign is
alive. Events occur all the time in the real world, and they should take place
in your campaign world, as well. Prices rise and fall. New characters come
and go. Dry spells lead to drought. Long periods of rain or snow lead to
floods. Leaders change. New shops open. Not every event needs to lead to an
adventure or be campaign-shattering in nature. They just need to happen to
show that the campaign is alive and things happen regardless of the actions
of the player characters.
On the other hand, the actions of the player characters should also have an
effect on the campaign. If the PCs break the law, they become unwelcome in
the town. If they cause trouble for the local crime lord, they run the risk of
becoming a target of the underworld. If they save the town from a terrible
evil, the town reacts in a positive fashion. Your campaign should be a reac-
tive environment, allowing the actions of the PCs to be catalysts for change
as well as magnets for adventures.
Building on past events
Use events from previous adventures to provide motivation, drama, and con-
sistency. If you use what has gone before to prepare for what is still to come,
257
Chapter 20: Building a Continuous Story

you create a campaign that is more than just a series of unrelated adventures.
Here are some of the best way to build on past events to create a richer D&D
experience:
 Using recurring NPCs: Recurring nonplayer characters provide a power-
ful tool for bringing the past back into the present. These can be helpful
or ambivalent NPCs, such as various town folk who trade with the player
characters or provide news and information on a regular basis. They can
also be opponents and villains who keep coming back to challenge the
player characters. Don’t overuse this technique; when you use recurring
characters with care and precision, you create a more realistic campaign
that remembers its past and the past of the player characters.
 Developing relationships between PCs and NPCs: Allow the player
characters to develop relationships that go beyond the adventures they
participate in. Friendships and rivalries, love interests, mentors and
patrons, helpful informants — all these relationships and more should
be available to the player characters in your campaign. Let them
develop naturally over time as recurring characters come into and out of
the lives of the PCs.
When the player characters develop relationships, you can use these to
motivate them and spin off adventures. A trusted merchant needs the PCs
to protect a shipment, a friend is kidnapped, or a helpful monastery
becomes the target of an evil enemy. Don’t overuse this technique or the
player characters will never make any attachments, but every so often
you can hit them where it hurts and spur the campaign in a new direction.
 Changing it up: Allow for change in the campaign. As the player charac-
ters get to know the campaign world and become comfortable, change
things. If the leader of the night watch has become a trusted and too-
often-relied-upon friend to the PCs, have him disappear in the line of
duty. If the King’s Road was once peaceful and well protected, make it
become increasingly dangerous to travel. Such changes intrigue players
and make them anxious to find out the reasons behind them.
 Foreshadowing events: Always look for ways to foreshadow future
events in current adventures. And with a little cleverness, you can look
for opportunities to turn previous events into hints of upcoming plots
even when you didn’t plan it that way. 
Finding inspiration
Depending on whom you ask, there are anywhere from one to a dozen or more
basic stories. Certainly, many D&D adventures follow one of several very
common plot structures — plot structures shared by any number of novels,
258
Part IV: Building a Campaign 

comic book storylines, or action movies. For the purposes of having fun in
your D&D game, feel free to borrow from your favorite sources as you work
on building adventures and campaigns. Obviously, you have to watch out
that you don’t use something that the players will recognize and figure out
immediately, but you can alleviate that by changing and adding details.
Where should you look for inspiration? Start with fantasy novels and movies. A
villain, a plot, a monster, a kingdom — something in your favorite fantasy novel
or movie is just itching to get into your D&D campaign. Change a name, alter an
appearance, give a character a different race or class, and soon the inspiration
begins to morph into something that is almost completely your own.
Don’t stop at the fantasy section, though. You can do the same thing with
almost any genre and any medium. That new techno-thriller you just read?
That would make a great D&D adventure! You just need to “fantasy” it up so
that it fits into your campaign. Turn a terrorist cell into a demonic cult, make
a main bad guy a vampire, and change a real city’s name to Waterdeep (for
example), and you have the makings of an exciting series of D&D adventures.
Other sources of inspiration include comic books, movies and television
series of all types, computer games, and any idea-generating activities you
participate in. You can basically take the story you want to borrow and per-
form only the changes necessary to make it into a D&D story, or you can
simply use it as inspiration for storylines of your own creation. A few stories,
endless variation. That’s the secret. 
Choosing themes for adventures 
and campaigns
Themes help you and the players approach the game. You can have an over-
arching theme for the whole campaign, or you can vary the theme from
adventure to adventure. Remember the original Star Trek television series?
The overarching theme of the series was action and adventure with moral
overtones as Captain Kirk and his crew explored the vast reaches of space.
Every so often, however, the theme varied in individual episodes. The usual
serious episodes (“The City on the Edge of Forever,” for example) sometimes
gave way to lighter fare (such as “A Piece of the Action” or “The Trouble with
Tribbles”). Even so, it still remained Star Trek. You can do the same thing in
your campaign.
In the following sections, we discuss some themes you might want to base
individual adventures on or perhaps use for your entire campaign.
259
Chapter 20: Building a Continuous Story

Action and adventure
Most D&D adventures and campaigns fall under this theme, where characters
have a task to accomplish and obstacles to overcome. Such adventures are
full of . . . well, action and adventure! It’s the stuff that D&D is made of.
Exploring dungeons, visiting fantastic locations, battling terrible monsters —
that’s D&D! 
We suggest that you use action and adventure as the overall theme of your
campaign, and then vary the themes of individual adventures every so often
for a change of pace and to keep the players guessing.
Comedy
Comedy is hard. It’s hard to do humor well, hard to maintain through an
entire adventure (let alone an entire campaign), and it often causes game
groups to fall apart because no one takes the game seriously when every-
thing is presented as a joke. 
Don’t present every single thing as a joke in a comedic adventure — doing so
makes it very difficult for the players to take the game seriously and could
cause the game group to fall apart. Remember, many great comedies use a
conventional, ostensibly serious storyline as a place for the gags, wisecracks,
and caricatures to shine.
That said, as a change of pace, a good humorous D&D adventure can energize
a campaign. When it works, it’s memorable. When it falls flat, it has the poten-
tial to cause irreparable harm to your campaign. The purpose of a comedy-
themed adventure is fun for fun’s sake, setting up humorous situations that
have little or no actual danger or tragedy associated with them. Plans (both
villains’ and player characters’) go awry, amusing NPCs are commonplace,
and encounters tend to be strange and peculiar. Imagine using A Fish Called
Wanda or Monty Python and the Holy Grail as the inspiration for a D&D adven-
ture, and you can begin to see what a comedy-themed session could look like.
What might work best for your campaign is to limit the comedic element to
one or two NPCs who occasionally provide comic relief. Interaction with
these NPCs is best handled in small doses.
Espionage
Active and grim, the espionage theme involves political intrigue, spying,
assassination, sabotage, and other cloak-and-dagger activities that usually
require intricate planning, stealth, and roleplaying. This theme is hard to
maintain over the course of an entire campaign, but it makes for powerful
adventures when used sparingly.
260
Part IV: Building a Campaign 

Exploration
Similar to action/adventure, the difference here is that the search and discov-
ery of new places tends to be the point of each adventure and perhaps the
entire campaign. An exploration-themed campaign works if you set up a
strange new land for the player characters to explore and that becomes the
driving force of all your adventures. Although exploration is another example
of a theme that’s hard to sustain over an entire campaign, such adventures
form the basis of some of the most memorable game sessions that we’ve ever
Dungeon Mastered.
Horror
Horror-themed adventures or campaigns require the players and their char-
acters to be scared. This is almost impossible to accomplish unless the play-
ers are willing to get into the mindset and treat the situations you present as
though they were participating in a horror movie. 
When it works, horror and D&D make for a powerful combination. For horror
to work, it has to be intense and potentially overwhelming. Because the player
characters face monsters on a regular basis, you have to alter your approach
to the monsters in a horror-themed adventure. Keep the monsters out of sight
until the attack comes. Alter the powers and appearances of familiar monsters
or use new monsters for the first time to surprise and terrify the player char-
acters. Make your descriptions dark, creepy, and menacing. (If the Alien
movies were a D&D campaign, Alien would be a horror-themed adventure and
Aliens would be an action/adventure-themed adventure.)
Mystery
This is another theme that’s hard to maintain for an entire campaign but can
be used very effectively in specific adventures. A mystery is something to
solve, whether it’s a murder or a robbery or something else. One way to use
mystery as the theme of a campaign is to set up a Big Mystery that the player
characters must solve over the course of many adventures. Who killed the
player characters’ mentor and set them on the path of adventuring? Where
are the strange draconic monsters coming from? Who really controls the Cult
of the Red Hand? If clues to the Big Mystery are revealed every few adven-
tures, and some adventures relate directly to the Big Mystery, you’re using
mystery as the theme of your campaign. You can see examples of this theme
over the course of a campaign in television series such as Twin Peaks, 24, The
X-Files, and Supernatural.
Revenge
Revenge works as the theme of a campaign as long as not every adventure in
the campaign focuses on it. When the player characters must hunt down the
one-armed mind flayer that murdered their mentor or work to undermine the
261
Chapter 20: Building a Continuous Story

evil king who ordered the destruction of their village, revenge is the motiva-
tion for their adventuring and the theme of your campaign. The same holds
true when you use it as the theme for specific adventures. 
As with any long-term theme, revenge works best if you provide ways for the
player characters to have small victories along the way. If after a hundred
adventures the player characters are no closer to finding the one-armed mind
flayer, the players will feel very frustrated. (Revenge is best served cold, not
frozen solid.) The payoff has to come sometime, and then maybe it’s time to
end the campaign and start something new or to spin off the campaign in a
new direction with a new theme.
The Dungeon-of-the-Week 
Campaign Model
You’re building a campaign. You’ve selected a theme. How do you get it to roll
out from game session to game session? Use the tried and true television
series model — the dungeon-of-the-week campaign! Your campaign is just like
your favorite ongoing television series, and the player characters are the
stars in the show. Like the crew of the Enterprise (pick your favorite model
and era), they set off on an exploration mission — but the PCs explore the
depths of the dungeon instead of the depths of space. Like the characters
from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, they fight monsters every week,
often saving the world (literally) through their efforts.
If you imagine that your campaign is a television series, you can follow the
same rules that are used for any ongoing story. You want to establish certain
ground rules. For example, almost anything can happen between the start
and end of any particular episode or game session, just so long as things are
put back mostly as they were by the climax. Sure, you can and should allow
for major changes to occur, but you can control those changes and what they
mean for your campaign. You want to treat each adventure as the next
episode in your ongoing storyline. Some relate directly to the overall theme
of your campaign, and some are side treks that explore a different theme and
show off a different aspect of your world.
The easiest campaign to build uses the dungeon-of-the-week model (even
though some dungeons might take more than one session to complete). Each
time you need a new adventure, you create a new dungeon. Populate it with
encounters worthy of the level of the player characters, and create a memo-
rable villain to serve as the main antagonist or boss monster (see Chapter 21
for more on creating villains). Just as the two brothers in the TV show
Supernatural go to a new town each episode to deal with a new monster, so
too do the player characters in your campaign go to a new dungeon each
adventure.
262
Part IV: Building a Campaign 

Building on What the Players Give You
Our last bit of advice about campaign building is simple: Use what the play-
ers give you. It’s their story, too. Many players like to create interesting back
stories for their characters or think up long-term story goals and aspirations.
For example, a player might decide that her wizard character hopes to learn
the secrets of a long-forgotten tradition of elven high magic someday, or
maybe another player says that his barbarian character is the last survivor of
a tribe massacred by undead giants. Look for opportunities to incorporate
these player-invented plots into adventures from time to time. Not only does
it give you grist for your creative mill, but you’re guaranteed to provide an
adventure that is immediately compelling to at least one of the players.
Keep your ears open when the players are discussing the events of the
adventure — you’ll often hear them make suggestions that you never thought
of but you just have to use. So use them! Later, the players will think they
were clever for having figured it out, and you never have to let them know
that they actually came up with the idea.
That’s why we love to make the players recap the previous game session at
the start of the current one. Let the players tell you what they think hap-
pened. This often leads them to speculate, toss around ideas, and come up
with something you never thought of. Why should you do all the work? If the
players want to give you ideas (even if they don’t realize it), be willing to take
them. Take inspiration for your campaign from all sources, including the play-
ers. If anyone is thinking about the campaign anywhere near as much as you
are, it’s them. Let them help you. The campaign will be stronger because of it.
Converting an Old Campaign 
to the 4th Edition
If you played previous editions of D&D, the new 4th Edition offers both chal-
lenges and opportunities. Maybe you have a long-running campaign that you
want to continue while using the rules of the new edition, or at least a richly
detailed world you want to keep using as the setting for your adventures.
How do you convert the campaign and your world to 4th Edition? On the
other hand, a new edition is a good excuse (if you need one) to bring an old
campaign to a climactic ending and start over with something new, which can
be refreshing. 
263
Chapter 20: Building a Continuous Story

Basically, there are three ways to handle the transition from a previous edi-
tion of D&D to a new 4th edition campaign:
 You can gloss over the transition, mid-campaign or even mid-adventure,
making as few and as minor changes as possible.
 You can introduce a dramatic catastrophe, an excuse to change your
world to account for changes in the new edition of the game.
 You can end your campaign and start fresh with a new campaign set in a
new world.
In the following sections, we look at each of those possibilities in more depth.
Glossing over the transition
In the right circumstances, it can be really easy to transition your campaign
to use 4th Edition rules without even taking a break from the action. We rec-
ommend offering your players a choice of either creating 4th Edition versions
of the their characters or making entirely new characters. Ideally, enough
players will convert their characters that the party retains some continuity
and you can continue the adventures.
A few things might make this kind of transition a little more difficult:
 If you have created a detailed world already, you might feel the need
to explain the addition of new character races such as dragonborn.
(Tieflings and eladrin have roots in past editions of the game but have
new prominence in 4th Edition, so you might need to explain their new
roles, too.) You could just prohibit players from making characters of
these races, but it’s more interesting if you let these new races expand
your campaign.
 If everyone in your campaign is playing characters that are hard to
convert, you might lose all continuity in your player character group. If
your players played enough 3rd Edition that they grew tired of standard
options, they might all be playing classes like swordsage (from Tome of
Battle: The Book of Nine Swords) or spellthief (from Complete
Adventurer), which don’t have direct analogues in the 4th Edition
Player’s Handbook. You can look for conversion advice on D&D Insider
(www.dndinsider.com) and give your players plenty of creative
license. With creative conversion, using multiclass feats and perhaps
some judicious reflavoring of powers, your players might find that they
can create exciting new incarnations of their favorite characters.
264
Part IV: Building a Campaign 

 If everyone decides to make new characters even if they could easily
convert, your players might be telling you that they’re ready to start
fresh. Talk to them, but this could be a sign that you should explore
another option for transitioning your campaign.
After your players have converted their characters or created new ones, you
can pick up right where your campaign left off. Get the players to help you
explain where their old characters went and where their new ones came
from. Ease them into their new adventures while they get used to their char-
acters’ new capabilities.
One key question you should think about is what level the 4th Edition charac-
ters should be. You can leave them at the same level they were in the previ-
ous edition, as long as they weren’t above 30th level. But you might want to
look at the adventures you’ve been running and see whether the characters
should be higher level. For example, if your 3rd Edition player characters
were 7th level and fighting a lot of yuan-ti (which were appropriate chal-
lenges for 7th-level characters in 3rd Edition), you might consider having
your players re-create their characters at around 14th level, since yuan-ti in
4th Edition range in level between 13th and 17th. That’s a big jump, but it will
help you maintain a sense of continuity in the campaign.
Blowing up the world
In its 4th Edition incarnation, the world of the FORGOTTEN REALMS is undergoing
a major transition, which includes a hundred-year jump into the future. The
change to the 4th Edition rules is only one small reason for making such sig-
nificant alterations to the world, but if you want to bring cataclysmic change
to your campaign world, the new edition can be a convenient excuse.
The best way to blow up your world (in order to rebuild it again, of course) is
in the course of your campaign. Let the high-level characters of your past
campaign do what they can to fight the cataclysm, or at least minimize the
damage inflicted on innocent bystanders. Let them play a significant role in
rebuilding the world. 
You might take a page from the FORGOTTEN REALMS setting and let a magical
catastrophe sweep across your world, similar to the Spellplague. You could
set up a war among the gods that leaves the old player characters of the cam-
paign as the new gods of the world. Or perhaps a gateway to the Far Realm
springs open, unleashing aberrant terrors across the world, leading the
player characters into a climactic battle with a terror from beyond the stars
that resembles something out of the stories of H. P. Lovecraft. 
265
Chapter 20: Building a Continuous Story

The new face of your world is up to you, of course, but you might consider
reshaping your world more in the image of the default D&D world described
in the Dungeon Master’s Guide (page 150). If your old campaign featured a
mighty empire whose influence reached to every corner of the world, a new
campaign featuring characters a thousand years after that empire’s fall who
explore its ruins can be very satisfying for you and your players. Moving your
campaign into the future of your world gives you opportunities to tie adven-
tures to events that your players remember from the previous campaign.
You don’t need a terrible cataclysm to adapt your game to the 4th Edition
rules. The rules are meant to model the things that characters do in the
world, not define them according to the laws of some magical physics.
Different rules offer a different model, but the fictional “reality” of your world
doesn’t need to alter in any significant way. You can use a big change in your
world to explain what are fundamentally story changes — the appearance of
the dragonborn race, for example, or a change to the way the planes are
arranged in your universe. But less dramatic changes, or even a hand-waving,
“it’s always been this way” approach, can also do the trick. See what works
best for your world and your players and run with that.
Starting fresh
Many DMs (ourselves included) get very attached to the campaigns they run
and the worlds those campaigns are set in. Even so, it’s not a bad idea to
start over from scratch once in a while, and a new edition of the rules is a
perfect opportunity. Maybe there are stories you’ve been wanting to tell that
just don’t fit in your current campaign. Maybe your players are itching to
play a different class or race. Maybe it would be good to take a break from
your campaign’s epic, world-shaking adventures and return to the days when
young heroes set out to fight nasty kobolds.
If nothing else, starting fresh is a good way to get used to the new rules. You
could use “Kobold Hall” in the Dungeon Master’s Guide, “The Necromancer’s
Apprentice” in Chapter 19 of this book, and perhaps The Keep on the
Shadowfell to play beginning characters through a few levels of adventure.
When you have the hang of the new edition, you can come back to your old
campaign and transition it to the new rules, either smoothly or dramatically.
Or you might just decide to stick with the new campaign!
Whatever you decide to do with your campaign, make sure to listen to your
players and find a solution that’s fun for everyone.

Chapter 21
Creating Memorable Villains
In This Chapter
 Defining the villain
 Examining the hero/villain connection
 Reviewing villain archetypes
V
illains come in all shapes and sizes. From master villains to minor vil-
lains, evil overlords to minions and lackeys, every heroic player charac-
ter needs a villain to battle and defeat.
In this chapter, we look at villains and how to turn them into memorable
parts of your D&D game.
What Is a Villain?
Player characters can have lots of foes, but they should have only a few vil-
lains. When we talk about villains, we mean the main antagonists, the boss
NPCs or monsters and their chief lieutenants in an adventure, not the many
minions and monsters that populate the bulk of a dungeon. A villain is more
than a random monster or enemy (though every dungeon and adventure
needs those, too). A villain is the evil behind the adventure, the catalyst that
sends the player characters into action (whether they realize the connection
or not). 
For an NPC or monster to be a villain, he or she (or it) must possess most or
all of the following qualities:
 Villains (directly or indirectly) oppose the player characters. Villains
force the PCs to take action and make decisions.
 Villains are powerful adversaries, commanding great resources.
Villains might not be able to defeat the player characters in direct melee

combat, but with the resources at their command, they will have many
guards and should be able to give the PCs a run for their money.
 Villains should be, for the most part, unsympathetic. Most villains
should be despised and hated by the player characters.
 Villains want to do the wrong thing. Their motives and goals should be
excessive, selfish, and to the detriment of others. Evil is what villains do.
 Villains need to be hated, but in a good way. You’ve done your job if
you’ve created a villain that engages the emotions of the players and
makes them love to hate the character. 
You might be tempted to create villains with complex and “realistic” motives,
but here’s the deal: You don’t have to work very hard to make a villain make
sense. In the fantastic world of D&D, villains can be starkly, irredeemably evil.
Crazed cultists and bloodthirsty orcs don’t turn to evil because of traumatic
events in their past, social alienation, psychological disorders, or bad
choices. They can just be evil, pure and simple. Keeping things “black and
white” rather than drawn in shades of gray is good because you’re letting the
players know that their characters can concentrate on defeating evil, not
understanding it or redeeming it. Morally ambiguous villains should defi-
nitely be the exception in most campaigns, and not the rule.
268
Part IV: Building a Campaign 

Every Hero Needs a Good Villain
Heroes have always been defined by the villains that oppose them. Peter Pan
and Captain Hook. Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty. Luke Skywalker and Darth
Vader. These heroes are tied to their villains in ways that go beyond simple
storytelling. The villains are the heroes’ mirror images, potential selves, and
polar opposites all at the same time.
When you consider villains for player characters, remember that the villain
might have a particular hatred for a specific character but usually serves as
the nemesis for the entire party. Because of the ongoing nature of a D&D cam-
paign, you might want to think of villains in the same way that comic book
superheroes have rogues’ galleries. Batman can’t fight the Joker every issue,
so the writers and artists invented Penguin, Two-Face, and Riddler. In the
same way, the player characters in your campaign shouldn’t have to battle the
same orc leader every adventure. Although not every adventure needs an
arch villain that will hound the heroes across multiple story arcs, you do need
to populate most adventures with a master villain and a few minor villains, in
addition to the various monsters and obstacles that pop up along the way.
Good villains take work
What makes a good villain? You want the villains you create (or at least the
majority of them) to be plausible. Flesh them out. Give some thought as to
why a villain is doing what it is he or she is doing. How does a villain interact
with the rest of your adventure story? With the other denizens of a dungeon?
If you think that your villains are just bad guys for the player characters to
defeat, so will the players.
Villains don’t have to be stupid. Make your villains, or at least the majority of
them, smart. Some can be evil geniuses, some can just be savvy, and once in
a while a few can be powerful and dumb. Play them as smart as you want
them to be, but no more or less than that. A bugbear chieftain might not be a
brilliant strategist, but he can still be cagey and wily and able to match wits
with the player characters. A mind flayer master villain, on the other hand,
might be so intelligent as to have an amazing number of contingency plans
and multiple schemes within schemes unfolding at any given time.
Don’t be afraid to make some of your villains truly evil. Betrayal, devious lies,
and hideous acts of evil for evil’s sake allow you to paint compelling pictures
of your villains. And when the player characters see them for the evil crea-
tures they are, the feeling of success for defeating them will be that much
sweeter.
269
Chapter 21: Creating Memorable Villains

On the other hand, not all antagonists need to be evil. Sometimes rivals will
appear to challenge the player characters, and these rivals can be good-
meaning nonplayer characters or even monsters with their own agendas.
Setting up an opponent who the player characters can’t or don’t want to fight
directly can make for an interesting change of pace.
Give villains every chance to succeed
The diabolical dragon lord, the evil royal wizard, the murderous bounty
hunter with a taste for blood — the range of intelligent villains is endless.
Make your villains memorable, and they will become the hated foes of the
player characters without any special effort on your part. Some villains can
be recurring antagonists that appear from time to time to harass the player
characters; others can be designed to serve that purpose for only the span of
a single adventure.
Carefully crafting your villain is only half the battle. To make your villain truly
effective, follow these tips for playing your villain:
 Don’t let a major villain confront the player characters too early in the
adventure. Use lackeys and other minions to fight for the villain when-
ever possible. Eventually, you want to give the player characters the sat-
isfaction of confronting and defeating the villain, but not until the time is
right. The right time is usually at the climax of the adventure.
 Use every available resource to foil the player characters. Villains
should be sneaky and resourceful. Some villains can hide in plain sight,
and others have vast wealth and power at their command. The villain’s
tactics depend on the role you want the villain to play in the adventure
and campaign. Keep in mind that for every ability that the player charac-
ters have, there is usually a way for a villain to counter it.
 Sometimes, give a villain the opportunity to confront the player char-
acters and get away. Use this technique if you want the villain to meet
the PCs early in an adventure or if you want the villain to become a
recurring character. Create escape plans for some of your villains.
Through misdirection, disguises, secret passages, magic, and swarms of
minions, you can give a villain a chance to get away. Don’t force the
issue, though. If the player characters come up with a way to circumvent
the plan, let them. You can always create a new villain as a replacement.
 Don’t let the player characters fight on their terms. A smart villain
fights the player characters from a place of strength and only when he
or she is well and truly prepared. Confronting villains in their strong-
holds isn’t the smartest thing for the player characters to do, but it
should be the only place major villains are willing to put their own lives
on the line.

Part IV: Building a Campaign 

Villain Archetypes
Villains come in two basic forms: master villain and minor villain. An adven-
ture or even an entire campaign should have a single master villain, but it can
have as many minor villains as you feel comfortable including. Minor villains
allow the player characters to gain small victories along the way without con-
fronting the master villain too early. 
If you ask seven different creative people to define archetypes for master and
minor villains, you’ll get seven similar but different answers. In the following
sections, we provide our version of the master and minor villain archetypes
most appropriate for use in a D&D game.
Master villains
The master villain stands at the center of the evil plot, working to achieve
some evil goal through the use of evil means. We’re talking evil villains here,
not adversaries who might be good but oppose the player characters as
rivals.
271
Chapter 21: Creating Memorable Villains

The following list describes archetypes that would fit as master villains into
most D&D campaigns:
 Agent provocateur: This is the clever spy who infiltrates an organiza-
tion and works to destroy it from the inside. For example, how better to
bring down a church devoted to law and order than to place a hidden
agent of evil high within its ranks? The identity of this master villain usu-
ally remains a closely guarded secret until the end of the adventure or
series of adventures that he or she is associated with, and he or she
strews lots of deception and false trails along the way.
 Avenger: This is the villain who seeks to right a real or imagined wrong,
but in the most heinous way possible. He or she seeks to ruin and ulti-
mately destroy the object of the seething anger, perhaps in one-on-one
battle, by destroying wealth and reputation, or by using a death trap of
some sort.
 Conqueror: The conqueror wants to seize control. He or she could be a
warlord leading a vast army or could be after control of an organization,
a place, or a person. This villain wants to be the center of attention, the
272
Part IV: Building a Campaign 

leader, and wants to gain this position by the force of his or her own will
and the strengths that make him or her stand out from the common folk.
 Corruptor: The corruptor seeks to change the pure into impure, the
holy into blasphemy. On a small scale, the corruptor seeks to darkly
influence a single character or group of characters, such as a king,
priest, or town council. On a large scale, the corruptor seeks to alter an
organization, city, or nation, turning it from a thing of law and order to a
thing of oppression and violence. In D&D campaigns, the corruptor can
be an evil god or an archdevil as often as a human or a monster.
 Destroyer: The destroyer has one goal — to cause destruction. Instead
of conquering or corrupting a nation or an organization, he or she wants
to destroy it. Destroyers might have a reason for wanting to cause death
and destruction, but they might also simply want to cause destruction
for destruction’s sake. (Villains don’t need to be complex!) Demon
princes are the ultimate destroyers, but plenty of monsters can fill this
role at any level.
 Master thief: The master thief wants the prize and usually has a grand
plan for getting it. Gold, jewels, artifacts, ancient tomes . . . if it has
worth, value, and a hint of power, the master thief can’t wait to lay
hands upon it. No challenge is too great, no vault secure enough to stop
master thieves from plying their trade.
 Organizer: Some villains control vast syndicates, such as a guild of
thieves or a slaver ring. Using brains, influence, and an army of under-
lings, the organizer sits at the center of a web of intrigue to control crim-
inal activities of one sort or another. 
 Ravager: Another version of the destroyer, the ravager uses terror as a
means of operation. Why just destroy a village if you can terrorize (and
have fun with) the villagers first? Such is the method used by this vile
villain.
 Zealot: The zealot follows a cause to the detriment of everything else,
seeking to re-create the world (or a portion thereof) in the image of his
or her beliefs. These beliefs can be philosophical, political, or religious
in nature, and the zealot can work alone or as the head of a widespread
organization.
Minor villains
Minor villains are the trusted lieutenants of the boss monsters, servants of
the master villains but on a level above the typical minions and lackeys most
often employed to trouble the player characters.
273
Chapter 21: Creating Memorable Villains

The following archetypes work well as minor villains in most D&D campaigns:
 Advance agent: This is the vanguard for some sort of invasion, whether
of an enemy army or of supernatural forces from another plane of exis-
tence. The advance agent sets the stage and hints of greater threats to
come, all the while accomplishing things that make it easier for the next
part of the invasion to take place.
 Assassin: This is the favorite killing tool of the master villain, a powerful
and deadly enemy in his or her own right who has no regard for life and
is totally loyal to his or her master.
 Corrupted hero: What master villain doesn’t have an ex-hero in his or
her employ? This character shows the dark side of the player characters
and shows what happens when a hero falls to evil. A corrupted hero usu-
ally has a player character class, such as fighter or ranger or wizard. The
most effective corrupted heroes are often former servants of good deities,
clerics or paladins who have turned to the worship of evil gods.
 Inquisitor: When master villains needs answers, they turn to the inquisi-
tor. The inquisitor is trained in torture and intimidation, and he or she
enjoys inflicting pain and suffering on others to do the job.
 Soldier: Many lieutenants serving master villains fall into this category.
Trained in battle and tempered by past campaigns, the soldier is experi-
enced, competent, and persistent in the execution of his or her task.
 Thug: A thug has a single job in any master villain’s organization — to
fight as told and without thinking. The thug is more powerful than the
typical minions serving the master villain and is often used to fill key
encounters in an adventure.

Part IV: Building a Campaign 

Chapter 22
Bringing the World to Life
In This Chapter
 Starting small and building out
 Dissecting the parts of a world
 Bringing all the elements together
You’re an expert at crafting fun and exciting adventures. You’ve taken a
shot at making memorable master villains to plague the player charac-
ters. You’ve begun to link the adventures together to start building your cam-
paign. Now you have to put everything in context and start fleshing out the
world beyond the dungeons and other specific locations the player charac-
ters have visited. 
When it comes to world building, you can get as complex as you want or keep
it simple. For examples of fully detailed worlds, take a look at published cam-
paign setting books such as FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Guide and EBERRON
Campaign Guide (releasing in 2009).
We advise you to keep things simple to start out with for your home-brewed
world, but you can take the tips we provide in this chapter and make your
world as simple or as complex and detailed as you like. You can create what-
ever details you want to craft a living, breathing campaign world. 
The World in a Nutshell: 
The DM’s Notebook
When you’re ready to go beyond one-time adventures and start building a
world for your campaign, you need to get organized. Even if you keep your
world relatively simple and small, you have a lot more maps, notes, timelines,
and all other sorts of details to keep track of for a world than you do for a
dungeon or one-time adventure.

A really helpful tool when it comes to developing your campaign world is the
DM’s notebook. All you need for a DM notebook are some folders or a binder in
which you collect the following items, adding pieces as you build your world:
 Maps: You should have maps for your world, from large-scale maps that
depict the entire world, down to maps of regions or countries, to maps
of towns and dungeons. You don’t have to create all of these maps until
you need them, of course, but make sure that your DM’s notebook con-
tains all the maps you’ve drawn for previous and current adventures in
your world.
 Notes: You should keep the notes for your world in your DM notebook.
You might find it helpful to organize your notes into the following cate-
gories and place them in separate folders in your DM notebook:
• Notes about the various places of interest in your world, such as
dungeons, castles, towns, and so on, including any historical or
background information you’ve created for those areas
• A calendar and/or timeline for the campaign’s world
• Character sheets for major and minor villains and other important
NPCs
• Notes on minor NPCs
• Notes on past adventures, including treasure collected, monsters
defeated, and plot developments you want to remember
• Up-to-date copies of each of the players’ character sheets
• Notes about the player characters’ long-term goals
• Notes regarding any house rules you’re using
Your DM notebook can be a physical binder full of paper, of course, but it 
can also be a series of files on your computer or a bunch of hyperlinked Web
pages. The important thing is that it’s organized in a way that works for you,
so you can find and remember the information you need when you need it.
Building a World from the Inside Out:
Start Small and Add Details
What do you need in order to establish the basis of your campaign? You’ve
already begun if you’ve gathered a team of players and run through a couple
adventures. If you’ve followed the guidelines in Chapter 8, you’ve set up a
base for the player characters, a place where they can rest, train, obtain heal-
ing, buy equipment, and get missions. 
276
Part IV: Building a Campaign 

Take a look at the maps of Fallcrest and its environs presented in Chapter 11
of the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Those are good examples of maps of a town
and its surrounding area. You can always add detail and new locations as you
need them. The trick is not to worry about the parts of the world that the
player characters aren’t going to see right away. Leave the kingdom and the
world map for later. Just concentrate on your town or village and the adven-
turing sites that are nearby.
As the player characters gain levels, you can start expanding your world out-
ward in a circle from the starting areas, so that you have ready locations for
whichever direction the PCs decide to follow. Sooner rather than later, your
campaign world — or at least the parts of it that you’re using — starts to 
take shape. Keep the details simple until you know where the player charac-
ters want to go next, and then you can develop the next portion of your
world map, complete with environmental notes, adventuring sites, and the
next community where the PCs can get training, equipment, and rumors of
adventure.
Don’t do more than you need to. When filmmakers build movie sets, they
make only the portions that they need for the scene. Walls and rooms are half
built, and doors lead to nowhere. Follow the same approach as you develop
your campaign world: Determine where things are only as you need them. If
the player characters aren’t going to cross the mountains until they reach
10th level, you don’t need to do the work necessary to populate that region
until they get close to that point in their adventuring careers.
Conversely, don’t feel constrained to creating only the areas the PCs are
about to explore. Keep it simple, but if you really enjoy the process of creat-
ing the world, do whatever you feel like. Just don’t spend so much time creat-
ing the unexplored continent that you don’t put enough detail in the secret
valley that the player characters will explore in the next game session.
Putting the World Together
You’re ready to start piecing your campaign world together. We advise you to
start small, detailing and nailing down only what you absolutely have to. 
But what do you really need? You need to fix any locations already encoun-
tered in any adventures you have run to date. Begin by marking down on
your setting map or recording in your notes the sites of dungeons, towns,
ruins, and other such features the PCs have already explored. In addition to
these locales, consider what else might be necessary to sustain the illusion of
reality for your imaginary campaign setting.
277
Chapter 22: Bringing the World to Life

Player characters need a base of operations, a place where they can return
after an adventure to rest, purchase supplies, and train. From 1st to 3rd level
or so, a small town works best for this, though a village can suffice in a pinch.
You certainly don’t have to figure out who all the 2,000 people living in the
small town are, but you do need to put some thought into the places the
player characters are likely to visit. These places include the inn or tavern,
the general store, the magic shop, the weapons shop, the local church or
temple, the local keepers of the peace and other authority figures, and
anyone who can serve as trainers for the characters.
Climate and geography
You need to decide on the climate and geography for the area around your
starting village or town. A temperate climate probably works best and usually
presents the easiest solution. Geography should be a mix of terrain types,
such as forest, hills, and plains to start. Make a simple map that shows the
relative locations and shape of the land, using the map of the area around
Fallcrest as a guide (see the Dungeon Master’s Guide, page 206). Then you
need to add other locations of interest, including encounter sites from previ-
ous adventures you have run for this group of player characters.
The great thing about a fantasy setting is that you can just make things up.
Still, you want to apply some level of logic to the world you build. Don’t put a
scorched desert next to an arctic plain, for example, unless you come up with
a fantastical reason for such a juxtaposition to exist. 
You really need to consider only three basic climate types when building a
D&D campaign world:
278
Part IV: Building a Campaign 

 Cold climates resemble arctic and subarctic regions on Earth and usu-
ally feature wintry conditions throughout most of the year. Portions of
your world can have a cold climate, or you can make the climate persis-
tent throughout much of the land. 
 Temperate climates enjoy approximately equal periods of warm and
cold seasons throughout the year. 
If you set up a campaign that takes place mostly in a temperate climate,
remember to keep a calendar so that you can make the seasons pass as
the game progresses.
 Warm climates range from subtropical to tropical environments, featur-
ing summer (or hotter) conditions for most of the year. In extremely
warm regions, adventurers might suffer adverse conditions for wearing a
lot of armor and carrying a load of equipment.
Likewise, you can keep it simple for the geography of your world. A fantasy
setting doesn’t need to have complex geology, ecosystems, and environ-
ments. Con-sider eight basic geographic types as you construct your D&D
campaign world:
 Aquatic geography consists mainly of salt or fresh water, such as lakes,
oceans, rivers, and inland seas.
 Desert describes any dry area that has little to no vegetation. Warm
deserts resemble places like Death Valley and the Sahara, and 
cold deserts appear much like Antarctica. Player characters need to 
deal with survival issues in this kind of terrain, not the least of which 
is acquiring food and water (though magic can help in this).
 Forest terrain features large tracts of tree-covered land. Food and water
are usually plentiful, and animal life is abundant.
 Hills describe rugged, raised terrain that doesn’t reach the level of
mountains.
 Marsh terrain features low, flat, waterlogged areas, such as what 
is usually found in swamps and bogs. Travel through marshes can be 
difficult if not treacherous.
 Mountains feature high elevation, little level ground, and decreasing
sources of food and water the higher you ascend. Travel is difficult and
often requires special equipment.
 Plains describe any relatively flat area that isn’t also one of the other ter-
rain types covered. Food and water are usually plentiful in a plains region.
 Underground describes subterranean passages and caverns. The D&D
game assumes that there is a vast expanse of underground areas
(whether they’re naturally occurring, made by people or monsters, or
both) where many adventures take place. 
279
Chapter 22: Bringing the World to Life

The Dungeon Master’s Guide features a good discussion on what the assumed
D&D world is like, including population centers (pages 152–157), wilderness
areas (pages 158–159), and the various planes of existence (pages 160–161).
Sites of interest
By sites of interest, we mean the places you expect the PCs to explore and
adventure in. These sites should be scattered across your world map, and
you can add new ones whenever you see fit. 
You want to create enough sites of interest in the region to sustain the PCs’
adventure needs at least through the level to which the PCs’ home base can
support their needs. When the PCs can no longer get the weapons, armor,
magical supplies, and other equipment appropriate for their levels in the local
settlement or town, they should move on to a larger, more populated area.
The following subsections describe some of the sites of interest that you
should add to your world’s map as places the PCs will eventually explore.
Castles
Castles and other kinds of keeps and strongholds guard the land, providing
places of protection for the population, barracks for soldiers, and supply cen-
ters for armies. Your starting area should have a few of these structures, though
perhaps not immediately near your starting village or town. Of course, larger
and more important centers of civilization should get larger castles, but small
towns and villages might have only a keep to protect them. Evil warlords and
rival baronies also maintain castles, and you can use these as adventure sites
for when the player characters are ready to take on such a challenge.
Ruins
No campaign is complete without several crumbling towers, abandoned tem-
ples, ruined castles, or forgotten cities hidden in the swamps and forests of
your world. Ruins can reveal historical secrets about your campaign, and
most serve as great adventure sites due to the large concentration of mon-
sters that often make ruins into lairs. Ruins can be obvious and known or
hidden and yet to be discovered. They can exist in the wilderness, away from
settlements, or they can serve as the foundation upon which current settle-
ments have been constructed.
Dungeons
You can place dungeons wherever you need them to be. They take the form
of carefully constructed complexes or natural caverns that snake through
hillsides and underground. Sewer networks, basements, and actual dungeons
280
Part IV: Building a Campaign 

fall into the category of man-made (or monster-made) dungeons, and extensive
cavern systems can link caves that are dozens or hundreds of miles apart,
forming regions of sunless expanse often referred to as the Underdark. All
these places usually hold terrors and treasures beyond imagining, waiting for
player characters to explore.
Monster lairs
When you consider placing monster lairs, don’t worry about every cave or
crack or crevice that hides a monster. Concentrate on the places where the
unusually tough or intelligent creatures live, or focus on the areas occupied
by large congregations of monsters. The bandits hiding in the old mine, the
medusa’s macabre garden of victims turned to stone, a dragon’s treasure
cave, and the cemetery haunted by wights or wraiths all come to mind as
places worthy of entries on your constantly growing campaign map. Side
treks, filler encounters, and adventures on the fly can all be thrown together
quickly if you have a handful of monster lairs ready in your notebook.
Not all monster lairs need to focus on dangerous creatures or threats to the
player characters. A grove of friendly treants, the grazing grounds of a herd
of unicorns, and a druid’s circle are all examples of friendly to neutral mon-
ster lairs that the player characters might have reason to visit from time to
time. You can even set up special arrangements where monsters that are usu-
ally considered to be enemies have worked out a deal with a nearby settle-
ment that allows each side to exist more or less in peace.
Even though a D&D world is imaginary and fantastic, you want to put just a
little consideration into the ecology of your campaign. For example, when
you place a settlement, you should also consider how that settlement feeds
itself. Do its citizens hunt and gather from a large forest, fish from a river or
lake, or support themselves with vast tracts of farmland? Consider these
kinds of questions when choosing locations for monster lairs. Are there
enough prey animals available in the area for a large, predatory monster?
How do nearby monsters interact with each other? Do they assist each other,
ignore each other, or fight each other at every opportunity? You don’t need
to get too technical, because it’s just a game and a fantasy, but some amount
of forethought can help add a touch of realism to your campaign. Check out a
monster’s entry in the Monster Manual for some ecological information and
then use your own imagination to make it fit into your campaign. 
Unusual phenomena
To accentuate the fantastic nature of your D&D world, be sure to judiciously
include a few places that just couldn’t exist in the real world. Nothing says
you’re in a place of magic more than areas that inspire awe, wonder, and 
even fear.
281
Chapter 22: Bringing the World to Life

A waterfall of lava, a forest of wild magic, a lake of glowing liquid that heals
whoever bathes in it, and a blasted patch of badlands where magic doesn’t
work are all example of sites of unusual phenomena. Let your imagination 
go wild. How about a village where the fog never dissipates? Or a range of
hills where spectacular and deadly fountains of fire erupt without warning?
Or an ancient cliffside where a deep crack in the rock echoes with the warn-
ings of tragedies to come? Make these sites strange and spectacular and a
little otherworldly, and the player characters will certainly want to investi-
gate them and find out more about them.
Don’t go overboard with unusual phenomena and create dozens or hundreds
of them throughout your world. If you overuse this element, each one will feel
commonplace and less fantastic.
Other settlements
As the player characters strike out deeper into your world, they should
encounter other settlements of intelligent beings. Some of these should be
human, elf, or dwarf settlements or even places where the common races mix
and meet. Others can be settlements of monsters, such as places where gob-
lins or orcs gather. Vary the size and wealth of these settlements. Include
more humble villages across the landscape than sprawling cities. Check out
the discussion on towns and communities in the Dungeon Master’s Guide,
starting on page 152, for a detailed look at this topic.

Steal this campaign setting!
You can certainly do all the work of world build-
ing yourself, but you have other options.
Wizards of the Coast regularly publishes cam-
paign setting material, both in print and online
through D&D Insider (www.dndinsider.
com). The two flagship settings of the D&D uni-
verse are the FORGOTTEN REALMS and EBERRON.
The FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Guide book
presents a world that is very much a traditional
D&D setting and is easy to use as is or to borrow
elements from to create your own campaign 
world. In the EBERRON Campaign Guide book, on
the other hand, you can find a world that has
more of an attitude and an air of action that
harkens back to pulp adventures. Both of these
settings are fully DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. You can
play them straight up as written, modify them, or
steal from them to make your own world.
However you use them and other settings like
them, they make great resources for content-
hungry campaigns like yours.

tions for ready-to-play encounters to use in your own

Chapter 23
Ten Heroic Encounters
M
emorable encounters are the building-blocks of great adventures. In
this chapter, we present ten heroic-tier encounters you can drop into
your own adventure, use as the basis to build an entire adventure around, 
or throw at the players when you need something in a hurry — like when 
the player characters go right and all you’ve prepared is the left side of the
dungeon! 
The encounters presented in this chapter feature a map, monsters and traps,
some details to set the scene, and a level. As DM, you get to decide when,
how, and where to use these encounters. You can easily customize them by
changing the monster selection, omitting some of the special terrain features
or traps, or redrawing the maps to fit into your dungeon. All of the maps
included are designed to be easy to make with D&D Dungeon Tiles, but of
course you can use whatever battle grid works best for you.
Each map includes arrows that indicate the expected direction of travel for
the characters — they arrive at the arrow pointing into the dungeon rooms
and leave by one of the arrows pointing away. The descriptions of monster
tactics in these encounters assume this direction of travel, so you might need
to mix things up a little, including altering the starting positions of monsters,
if the characters come at the encounters from a different direction. 
The encounters in this chapter are designed to challenge heroic-tier characters
(characters of level 10 or below). Chapter 24 presents ten paragon-tier encoun-
ters (level 11 through 20), and Bonus Chapter 3 (available at www.dummies.
com/go/dungeonmaster4e) includes ten epic-tier encounters for level 21 
to 30.
Goblin Lair
Level 1 Encounter (500 XP)
 2 dire rats (R)
 2 goblin warriors (G)
 1 goblin blackblade (B)

Set Up: To get from point A to point B in the dungeon, the characters have to
get past these goblins and their pet rats. Figure 23-1 shows a map of the little
complex of rooms the goblins have claimed as their lair. 
Read Aloud: The passage opens into a wide hall dimly lit with flickering lamps.
Two more passages lead off to either side, but an enormous rat scurries toward
you out of the shadows!
Goblin and Rat Tactics: The goblin warriors focus on ranged attacks while
the rats engage characters in melee. The goblins try to use great position to
deal extra damage with their ranged attacks every round, and goblin tactics
to duck away from melee. If it starts its turn adjacent to an enemy, a goblin
warrior can shift away (a move action) and then use mobile ranged attack
(a standard action that includes both 3 squares of movement and a ranged
attack) to put some distance between itself and its attacker while still making
an attack. The goblin blackblade tries to find positions where it and a rat
flank a character in order to gain combat advantage.

Dire Rats (2)
A dire rat is an enormous rat the size of a large dog. Strange bony growths protrude from its back
and shoulders, and its teeth are more like fangs than the sharp incisors of a normal rodent.

Goblin Warriors (2)
Goblins are small, wicked humanoids that delight in plunder and cruelty. They’re the smallest of
the goblin race, but some would say that just makes them the meanest. They’re the size of halflings
but have green skin; deep-set, yellow eyes; and mouths full of jagged teeth. These goblins wear
leather armor and carry spears and javelins. Each warrior has 5 javelins it can throw before resort-
ing to melee attacks with its spear.

Elf Raiders
Level 2 Encounter (625 XP)
 2 guard drakes (D)
 2 elf scouts (S)
 1 elf archer (A)

Set Up: Many players are accustomed to thinking of elves as friendly humanoids
or even potential allies, but these elves and their drake pets are out for blood.
They view natural humanoids as savage monsters, and even fey player charac-
ters (such as elves or eladrin) as corrupted by their association with other
races. They’re not interested in conversation and attack without warning. Figure
23-2 shows a map of the ambush they set up for the characters.
Read Aloud: The hall opens into a wide, long room with a high ceiling, like a
grand temple now in ruins. The room narrows at the far end, where a door leads
out. Two toothy reptiles hiss at you nearby, while a few stealthy humanoids
crouch in and near two piles of rubble across the room. They look like elves, but
their drawn bows reveal their hostile intent.
Elf and Drake Tactics: The drakes stay near their beginning positions, ready-
ing charges if necessary to make sure the characters get far enough into the
room to give the archer and scouts clear shots. They engage characters in
melee, trying to keep the characters away from the elves as much as possible.
The elf scouts move more cautiously up into melee, attacking and then shift-
ing away. They try to engage the characters in or near areas of difficult ter-
rain to take advantage of their wild step abilities. 
The elf archer tries to stay out of melee combat, attacking with her bow and
using not so close to shift away from characters who get adjacent.

Guard Drakes (2)
These small reptiles are about the size of a dog, and are equally fierce and protective of their mas-
ters. They walk upright on their hind legs. They’re covered with green scales but have bright red
and yellow crests extending from their heads down their backs.

Elf Scouts (2)
Elves originated in the Feywild but now live in the wild forests of the world. Some are civilized and
live near human communities, maintaining friendly relations with other races, but other elves are
more wild and hostile. These elves are civilized enough to wear metal chainmail armor and wield
dual swords, but they’re hostile to the humanoid races of the world.

Hobgoblin Guards 
Level 3 Encounter (750 XP)
 2 hobgoblin soldiers (S)
 2 hobgoblin archers (A)
 flame jet trap 
Set Up: Four hobgoblins guard this key intersection in the dungeon, aided by
a deadly trap that sprays jets of flame across the room. Figure 23-3 shows a
map of the room and the trap.
Read Aloud: You come to a junction, with one passage leading off to your left
and a door ahead and to the right. Four fierce-looking humanoids in heavy
armor stand ready as you approach, baring sharp teeth in their reddish faces.
Perception DC 18: You notice nozzles in the wall to your left, and scorch marks
on the floor. 
Hobgoblin Tactics: The hobgoblins know the workings of the trap and do not
willingly enter squares the flame jets can reach. The soldiers move to take up
a position adjacent to each other as soon as possible, to benefit from their
phalanx soldier ability. Likewise, the archers try to remain within 5 squares of
each other in order to benefit from the attack bonuses they grant each other.
One archer uses his first standard action to activate the flame jet trap.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Flame Jet Trap
Ten large nozzles are set into the walls of this chamber. Each one spews a jet of flame 6 or 8 squares
long and 1 square wide, in a random sequence when the trap is activated. 
Level 4 Lurker Trap
XP: 175
Initiative: +6. The trap rolls initiative when a hobgoblin uses a standard action to activate the
trap at the control panel near the door.
Flame Jet (close attack, standard action, at-will)  Fire
Each round, on the fire trap’s turn, roll 1d10. The nozzle corresponding to that number
erupts in a blast of flame that fills an entire row or column of squares and attacks
every creature in those squares: +7 versus Reflex, 1d8 + 4 fire damage and ongoing 5
fire damage.
Countermeasures: A character adjacent to one of the nozzles can disable it with a DC 14 Thievery
check. If the random die roll indicates that a disabled nozzle should fire, the trap doesn’t attack
that round. If the character’s Thievery check fails by 5 or more, the nozzle fires immediately.
A character adjacent to the control panel can deactivate the trap with a DC 9 Thievery check,
or completely disable it with three successful DC 14 Thievery checks. If the character fails any
check by 5 or more, one random nozzle fires immediately.

Fiery Doom
Level 4 Encounter (925 XP)
 2 magma claws (C)
 1 magma hurler (H)
 2 fire bats (B)
Set Up: The obvious path through this area of the dungeon is blocked by a
chasm filled with bubbling lava. Worse still are the fiery creatures that are
drawn to this manifestation of elemental power. Perhaps the lava represents
a place where the Elemental Chaos is seeping into the world, and these crea-
tures have passed from that plane to the mortal realm. Or maybe a villainous
mage used the lava’s heat to summon these monsters to guard the deepest
parts of the dungeon. Figure 23-4 shows a map of the room where the fiery
monsters lair.
Read Aloud: Hot air blows gently in your faces as you follow this hallway. Up
ahead, you can see the dim red glow of molten rock as the passage opens into a
large room. Some of that glow comes from a spot on the floor near the far side of
the room, but some comes from strange, rocky outcroppings closer at hand. . . . 
Figure 23-4:
The room is
only a little
fiery. Its
inhabitants,
though, 
are hot.
295
Chapter 23: Ten Heroic Encounters

The Chasm: The fiery chasm is a 5-foot drop into a shallow pool of lava. A
character can jump the chasm with a DC 11 Athletics check (or DC 21 with 
no running start). A character who falls in takes 3d10 fire damage. A creature
that starts its turn in the chasm takes another 3d10 fire damage. A creature in
the chasm can climb out with a DC 10 Athletics check.
Elemental Tactics: The five creatures in this room are all elementals, native
inhabitants of the Elemental Chaos. The magma claws keep to the large
chamber, engaging characters in melee and using their spew lava ability to
hold down any character who tries to head down the side passage. The fire
bats and the magma hurler concentrate their attacks on characters who get
past the magma claws. The fire bats use fiery swoop as often as possible,
whenever two or more characters are close enough together for the bats to
use their power. All of the elementals avoid using their attacks that deal ongo-
ing fire damage against characters who are already taking ongoing damage,
instead spreading that damage around as much as possible.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Magma Claws (2)
These elemental creatures are made of earth and fire, assembled in a form that looks a bit like an
earthly scorpion, though without the tail. When they’re still, they resemble volcanic rock, and they
lie still until enemies get close enough to charge.

The fire bat can’t attack a target more than once in this fashion, and it must end its
movement in an unoccupied square.

Orc Reavers
Level 5 Encounter (1,226 XP)
 2 rage drakes (RD)
 3 orc raiders (R)
 4 orc drudges (D)
 1 orc eye of Gruumsh (E)
Set Up: Orcs are savage and bloodthirsty, but a strong leader can force them
into service, even service as boring as guard duty. These orcs occupy an
inner and outer chamber that might stand between the characters and the
villain’s inner sanctum, or might be the first guard post in an orc-filled dun-
geon. Figure 23-5 shows the chambers and a sample set of starting positions
for the orcs and their rage drake pets.
This encounter pushes the limit of experience points for a 5th-level encounter,
which is normally worth 1,000 XP. A 6th-level encounter is worth 1,250 XP, so
at 1,226, this one only barely counts as 5th level. You don’t need to do anything
differently based on this information; just be aware that it might be slightly
tougher than you would expect a 5th-level encounter to be — although the
minions should keep it from being overpowering. 
Read Aloud: A red-scaled lizard the size of a horse blocks the nearer of two
doorways on the right-hand side of this room, the only exits. Three gray-skinned
humanoids stand ready at your approach.
Orc and Rage Drake Tactics: The orcs and rage drake in the outer room try
to hold the characters back from the doors, but one orc drudge shouts a warn-
ing and tries to run out through the farther door leading to the back room.
The monsters in the back room hold their positions in that room until the
characters enter the room. At that point, the raiders try to use the twin hall-
ways to move around the party of characters, charging at strikers and con-
trollers who don’t wear heavy armor. 
(continued)

The eye of Gruumsh is the orcs’ leader. He avoids melee as long as possible,
using eye of wrath and swift arm of destruction to help his allies until an enemy
comes within reach of his spear. He saves chaos hammer for when he has at
least three targets close enough together to get caught in the burst.

Chapter 23: Ten Heroic Encounters
Read Aloud: You hear the sound of growling speech from up ahead, answered by
something almost like a bark. In the flickering light of a torch, you see a humanoid
figure with a head like a wolf or hyena, its eyes glowing green in the shadows. A
chorus of high-pitched cackling or barking erupts behind that nearest figure.
Gnoll Tactics: The gnolls choose a single target, probably a player character
defender, and concentrate their attacks on that character. The marauders
flank their chosen prey and stay adjacent to that character so the claw fight-
ers and huntmasters benefit from their pack attack ability when attacking that
character. If their chosen target falls, they select another character and
repeat the same approach.
Gnoll Marauders (2)
These bestial humanoids stand over seven feet tall. Their heads resemble those of hyenas, and

Chapter 23: Ten Heroic Encounters
Forest Hunters
Level 7 Encounter (1,500 XP)
 1 macetail behemoth (MB)
 2 razorclaw stalkers (R)
 2 vine horror spellfiends (V)
Set Up: This encounter takes place outdoors, but the map in Figure 23-7
assumes that the characters’ path is narrowly defined. They might be walking
up a narrow gorge, following a trail along the side of a cliff, or traversing a
narrow band of clear terrain between a river and the thick forest. You can
decide what the walls on the map represent, or just place more Dungeon
Tiles if the characters move off the edge of the map.
The monsters in this encounter are a diverse bunch, but they share a connec-
tion to the natural world. Perhaps they’re agents of a forest cult that has been
kidnapping villagers for blood sacrifices to the hungry spirit of the corrupted
forest. Or they might be champions of a group that views the civilized races
as interlopers in the wilderness and seeks to purge their cities and towns
from the landscape. They might just be hunters who find sport in hunting
intelligent game such as the player characters.
It’s a good idea to start the encounter with the characters at the edge of the
first large tile, already about 40 feet past the left entrance of the map. This
gives them a little room to maneuver backward if they want to.
Read Aloud: A few trees cluster around a small pond up ahead, and you see a
large shape thrashing around in the grass near the water. Its back is covered
with a hard, plated shell, and its head is studded with sharp horns. A tail tipped
with a heavy club swishes back and forth behind it. As it turns its massive head
toward you, two humanoids come into view near the closest trees. Back near the
pool, two masses of vines congeal into forms that vaguely resemble human
shape.
Figure 23-7:
Ah, the
great
outdoors!
What’s so
great about
it, anyway?

Features: Special features of this area include the following:
 Trees: The three large tree trunks each fill one square, blocking move-
ment through those squares and providing cover to characters behind
them. A character can climb a tree with a DC 12 Athletics check.
 Shrubs: Smaller trees and shrubs in the area are difficult terrain. Tiny
plants that don’t fill a whole square have no effect on movement.
 Rocks: Squares full of large rocks block normal movement, but a char-
acter can scramble over them at half speed with a DC 10 Athletics 
check.
 Pool: The shallow pool is difficult terrain. 
Monster Tactics: The macetail behemoth is well-trained to pin characters
down in melee combat. It uses tail sweep the first time at least two characters
are adjacent to it on its turn, and again as often as it recharges. The vine hor-
rors use lashing vine of dread to push characters into positions near the
behemoth, and caustic cloud against characters who are keeping their dis-
tance from the beast. The razorclaw stalkers stay in constant motion to bene-
fit from their skirmish ability, even if it means spreading their attacks across
multiple characters.

Stalking Shadows
Level 8 Encounter (1,750 XP)
 3 shadar-kai warriors (R)
 1 shadar-kai witch (W)
 1 spectral panther (P)
Set Up: Figure 23-8 shows a network of natural tunnels where dangerous
denizens of the Shadowfell hunt in the darkness. Four shadar-kai and their
spectral panther pet lurk in the perpetual gloom of these caves. They might
be guards protecting something beyond, a patrol through the territory of a
shadar-kai ruler, or even potential allies the PCs might be able to persuade to
help them defeat a cult of Orcus in the area. (In that case, you could struc-
ture this encounter as a skill challenge where the characters must use
Diplomacy, Arcana, and Religion to convince the shadar-kai to help them.)
Read Aloud: The walls of these stone tunnels seem to absorb all light, shroud-
ing the area in shadow.
Perception DC 25: Stealthy figures lurk in the shadows ahead, holding blades
at the ready.
Dim Light: Because of this area’s ties to the Shadowfell, no light source can
create bright light here. Creatures in the dim light have concealment to any
character that doesn’t have low-light vision or darkvision. (The shadar-kai
and spectral panther all have low-light vision.) Concealment imposes a –2
penalty on melee and ranged attacks against that creature.

309
Chapter 23: Ten Heroic Encounters
Shadar-Kai and Panther Tactics: The shadar-kai warriors engage three differ-
ent targets, locking them in melee and using cage of gloom to literally hold
them in place. The spectral panther moves among the engaged characters,
taking advantage of flanking positions whenever possible, and using spectral
form and invisibility to avoid attacks and gain combat advantage against tar-
gets it can’t flank. If a character engages the witch, the panther focuses its
attacks on that character. 
Figure 23-8:

Shadar-Kai Warriors (3)
Shadar-kai are pale humanoids that live in the Shadowfell and serve the Raven Queen, the god-
dess of death and fate. They’re a bleak and grim race that ornament their skin with tattoos and
piercings. These warriors wield katars and wear chainmail.

The shadar-kai warrior makes two katar attacks.
Cage of Gloom (melee attack, standard action, recharge 5 6)
The shadar-kai warrior makes a katar attack. If the attack hits, the shadar-kai warrior
makes a secondary attack as strands of shadow coil around the target. Secondary
Attack: +11 versus Reflex, the target is restrained (save ends).

of midnight blue and disdains the use of any weapon except the blackfire she conjures to wreathe
her hands.

Blackfire Touch (melee basic attack, standard action, at-will)  Fire, Necrotic
+11 versus Reflex; 2d6 + 4 fire and necrotic damage.
Beshadowed Mind (ranged attack, standard action, recharge 4 5 6)  Necrotic
Ranged 10, +11 versus Will, 2d6 + 4 necrotic damage, and the target has no line of
sight to anything more than 2 squares from it (save ends).
Deep Shadow (close attack, standard action, encounter)  Necrotic
This power creates an aura of thick, writhing shadows that extends 2 squares around
the witch. The witch and any other shadow creatures in the aura gain concealment.
In addition, enemies that enter or start their turns in the aura take 5 necrotic damage,
and enemies (including flying ones) also treat the area within the aura as difficult ter-
rain. The shadar-kai witch can sustain the aura as a minor action. However, the effect
ends if she uses shadow jaunt or moves more than half her speed on her turn.
Shadow Jaunt (move action, encounter)  Teleportation
The shadar-kai witch teleports 3 squares and becomes insubstantial until the start of
her next turn. While insubstantial, the shadar-kai witch takes half damage from all
attacks.
Skills: Acrobatics +8, Arcana +12, Perception +4, Religion +12, Stealth +13

Chapter 23: Ten Heroic Encounters
Spectral Panther
A spectral panther is a shadowy feline native to the Shadowfell. It’s invisible most of the time as it
hunts through the darkness, becoming visible only when it attacks.
Spectral Panther Level 9 Lurker
Medium shadow beast
XP: 400
Initiative: +13
Senses: Perception +10; low-light vision
HP: 76; Bloodied: 38
AC: 23; Fortitude: 22; Reflex: 24; Will: 20

Claws (melee basic attack, standard action, at-will)
+14 versus AC; 2d6 + 5 damage.

square adjacent to the spectral panther, at-will)
+14 versus AC, 1d6 + 2 damage.
Combat Advantage: The spectral panther deals an extra 2d6 damage against any
target it has combat advantage against.
Invisibility (standard action, usable only while in spectral form, at-will)  Illusion
The spectral panther is invisible until it makes an attack. It can end this effect on its
turn as a free action.
Spectral Form (standard action, at-will): The spectral panther becomes insubstantial.
While insubstantial, it takes half damage from all attacks. It gains a +5 power bonus to
Stealth checks but deals only half damage with its attacks. It can end this effect on its
turn as a free action.
Skills: Perception +10, Stealth +14 (+19 in spectral form)
See the spectral panther’s complete statistics on page 213 of the Monster Manual.
Big Trouble
Level 9 Encounter (2,200 XP)
 3 trolls (T) 
 1 oni mage (O)
Set Up: Wicked and stupid, trolls are easily bent to the will of a strong, smart
leader, such as the oni mage in the large room shown in Figure 23-9. This
could be a climactic encounter, the antechamber to the big villain’s hideout
with the trolls and oni as guards, or a side lair in a larger dungeon complex
where the trolls hunt, bringing the treasure they find to the oni mage.

312
Part V: The Part of Tens 
The doors leading in and out of this room are large and heavy, requiring a DC
15 Strength to open. (The trolls have a +10 Strength check modifier, and the
oni mage has a +11. Outside of combat, they can open the doors easily, assum-
ing an average roll of 10 on their checks. In combat, it’s almost trivially easy.)
At the start of the encounter, the oni mage is disguised as troll using its
deceptive veil power. Its greatsword is hidden in the rubbish beside its start-
ing position.
Read Aloud: The heavy door creaks open, revealing an enormous room
beyond. A large pool of foul-smelling brown water dominates the center of the
room, and piles of filth and rubbish are heaped against the walls. Three warty
green humanoids squat at the pool’s edge, looking up dimly at the noise of the
door. A fourth troll huddles against the right-hand wall.
Insight DC 25: There’s something different about the troll near the wall. Its face
is more expressive, its movements more calculated. You’d guess that it’s some
other creature disguised as a troll.
Figure 23-9:
Sometimes
deadly
things come
in really big
packages.

Features: Special features of this area include the following:
 Pool: The noxious pool is 10 feet deep. A character who falls into the
pool can swim out with a DC 10 Athletics check, but the vile stuff deals
ongoing 5 poison damage (save ends). The trolls and oni are effectively
immune to the poison because of their regeneration.
 Rubbish: The heaps of rubbish along the walls are difficult terrain.
Troll and Oni Tactics: The stupid trolls wade into melee with little concern
for their safety. They’re smart enough to avoid characters wielding fire or
acid, but otherwise display no tactical understanding or strategy. The oni
mage, on the other hand, fights much more intelligently. It turns invisible and
uses its freezing blast and lightning storm powers, then grabs its greatsword
from the rubbish pile and drops its disguise. It moves into flanking positions
with the trolls to gain combat advantage against the characters and uses its
magical abilities as soon as they recharge.

Close blast 5, +15 versus Fortitude, 1d8 + 6 cold damage, and the target is slowed
(save ends).
Lightning Storm (area attack, standard action, recharge 5 6)  Lightning
Area burst 2 within 10, +15 versus Reflex, 2d6 + 4 lightning damage.
Combat Advantage: The oni mage deals an extra 1d6 damage on melee attacks
against any target it has combat advantage against.
Deceptive Veil (minor action, at-will)  Illusion
The oni mage can disguise itself to appear as any Medium or Large humanoid. A suc-
cessful Insight check (opposed by the oni’s Bluff check) pierces the disguise.
Invisibility (standard action, at-will)  Illusion
The oni turns invisible until it attacks.
Elite: As an elite monster, the oni mage gets a +2 bonus on saving throws and has 1 action point
that it can spend during the encounter. 
Skills: Arcana +14, Bluff +15, Insight +12, Perception +7
See the oni mage’s complete statistics on page 201 of the Monster Manual.

Set Up: As the characters make their way across swampy ground, they come
across two young women weeping near a pool. Figure 23-10 shows the area.
This doesn’t have to be an outdoor swamp — it could be a vast underground
cavern lit by glowing mushrooms that tower over the fetid water, or an
ancient ruin half-drowned in a stinking marsh. 
The weeping women are actually bog hags. They try to lure the characters
close to the pool, then summon their allies — two chuuls hiding in the deep
water and a venom-eye basilisk lurking in the undergrowth nearby — to help
them kill and eat the characters.
Read Aloud: A pool of clear water comes into view, a welcome respite from the
mud and muck you’ve been trudging through. Crouched at the edge of the pool,
though, are two young human women, weeping and wailing. Seeing you approach,
they stretch out their arms. “Help us, travelers! Our sister has drowned!”
Insight DC 17: There’s something not quite convincing about the women’s grief.
Perception DC 21: A large reptilian form is half-hidden beneath a tree over
beyond the pool.
Features: Special features of this area include the following:
 Swampy Ground: The whole encounter area is swampy ground. Creatures
can’t run or charge in the area unless they have swamp walk, but other-
wise movement is unaffected. 
Figure 23-10:
Who says
wetter is

315
Chapter 23: Ten Heroic Encounters

316
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 Trees: The five large tree trunks each fill one square, blocking movement
through those squares and providing cover to characters behind them.
A character can climb a tree with a DC 15 Athletics check.
 Shrubs: Smaller trees and shrubs in the area are difficult terrain. Tiny
plants that don’t fill a whole square have no effect on movement.
 Rocks: Squares full of large rocks block normal movement, but a charac-
ter can scramble over them at half speed with a DC 10 Athletics check.
 Pool: What looks like a fairly small pool actually opens into a large water-
filled cavern. Two chuuls lurk under there, waiting for the hags to signal
them up to attack. Swimming in the pool requires a DC 15 Athletics check.
Monster Tactics: If they fool the characters, the hags wait until their prey is
right next to the pool; then they whistle for the chuuls and basilisk to attack.
Characters who notice either the hags’ poor bluff or the hiding basilisk aren’t
surprised by the attack and can act in the surprise round along with the mon-
sters. The chuuls erupt from the pool and attack the nearest characters, the
hags make claw attacks against the nearest characters, and the basilisk turns
its venomous gaze on the largest clump of characters it can affect.
Chuuls (2)
Looking somewhat like enormous crustaceans with poisonous tentacles, chuuls are strange aber-
rations sometimes associated with mind flayers. 
Chuul
Level 10 Soldier
Large aberrant magical beast (aquatic)
XP: 500
Initiative: +10
Senses: Perception +9; darkvision

Speed: 6, swim 6
Claw (melee basic attack, standard action, at-will)
Reach 2, +17 versus AC; 1d6 + 6 damage, or 3d6 + 6 damage against an immobilized
creature.
Double Attack (melee attack, standard action, at-will)
The chuul makes two claw attacks. If both claw attacks hit a single target, the chuul
makes a secondary attack against the same target with its tentacles. Secondary Attack:
+14 versus Fortitude, the target is immobilized (save ends). This is a poison effect.
Tentacle Net  Poison
A creature hit by a chuul’s opportunity attack is immobilized until the end of the
chuul’s next turn.
Skills: Perception +9
See the chuuls’ complete statistics on page 43 of the Monster Manual.

Chapter 23: Ten Heroic Encounters
Bog Hags (2)
Vicious fey that embody the decay and corruption of the swamp, bog hags can appear as beauti-
ful women to lure their prey. Once enemies are within reach, though, they reveal their true, hideous
forms and rend with their long, sharp claws.
Bog Hag

Claw (melee basic attack, standard action, at-will)
+15 versus AC; 1d8 + 6 damage.
Rending Claws (melee attack, standard action, recharges when first bloodied)
The bog hag makes two claw attacks against the same target. If both claws hit, the
hag deals an extra 5 damage to the target.
Unwholesome Presence: Aura 3; enemies in the aura gain only half the normal hit
points from spending healing surges.
Change Shape (minor action, at-will)  Polymorph
A bog hag can alter its physical form to appear as a beautiful young female elf, half-
elf, eladrin, or human. It can revert to its true form as a minor action.
Evasive Charge: The bog hag shifts 2 squares after charging.
Skills: Intimidate +12, Nature +12, Perception +7, Stealth +14
See the bog hags’ complete statistics on page 150 of the Monster Manual.
After the surprise round, the chuuls pin characters down in melee while the
hags charge in and shift out, taking full advantage of the swampy terrain. The
basilisk doesn’t emerge from its position unless it has to.
Venom-Eye Basilisk
Vaguely resembling a six-legged crocodile, a basilisk is a dangerous reptile with a deadly poiso-
nous gaze.
Venom-Eye Basilisk

damage (save ends). As long as the target is taking ongoing poison damage from this
attack, the target deals 2 poison damage to all creatures adjacent to it at the start of
its turn.

Chapter 24
Ten Paragon Encounters
T
his chapter presents ten encounters designed to challenge characters in
the paragon tier (level 11 through 20). See the beginning of Chapter 23 for
general information about the encounters presented in this chapter.
Serpent Cult
Level 11 Encounter (3,075 XP)
 Snaketongue celebrant (C)
 2 snaketongue assassins (A)
 5 snaketongue zealots (Z)
 2 crushgrip constrictor snakes (S)
Set Up: Who’s behind the strange disappearances and assassinations in the
city? This cult of Zehir, human devotees of the serpent god who have
received his “blessing” and become like the yuan-ti. Figure 24-1 shows their
hidden temple, which might be hidden in the jungle, tucked amid some
ancient ruins sacred to Zehir, or in an abandoned warehouse in a city slum.
Read Aloud: The air here is warm and humid, and it seems very dark despite a
hint of firelight flickering on the stone ahead. Yellow eyes gleam in the darkness
as a dry scraping of scales reaches your ears. 
Features: Special features of this area include the following:
 Pillars: A Medium or smaller creature in the same square as one of the
small pillars has cover.
 Brazier: Outside the snake pit is a large brass brazier full of flaming
coals, standing on an elegant tripod. An adjacent creature can knock it
over to attack another adjacent creature, making a Dexterity attack
against the target’s Reflex defense. On a hit, the target takes 3d10 fire
damage.

 Snake Pit: The center of the cult’s complex is a pit full of venomous
snakes, with a statue of Zehir overlooking it. Here the cult offers sacri-
fices to its dark god by throwing victims into the pit. A creature that
starts its turn in the pit takes 2d10 poison damage and ongoing 5 poison
damage (save ends).
Serpent Cult Tactics: The zealots and crushgrip constrictor snakes engage
the characters in melee as the celebrant hangs back, leading with his ranged
and area attacks. In melee, the assassins and the celebrant begin in their
humanoid forms, using their poisoned blades to deal ongoing poison damage
to characters and then switching to serpent form for the sake of higher
defenses and superior melee attacks. When their opponents save against the
ongoing poison damage, they switch back to humanoid form to deliver a
fresh dose of poison. 
If the celebrant or the assassin has an opportunity to bull rush a character
into the snake pit, the monster does so in serpent form.

Snaketongue Celebrant
In the absence of true yuan-ti to lead them, snaketongue cults of Zehir turn to priests of their own
kind, such as this celebrant. Mostly human, he wears a hooded robe that helps to hide his scaly skin

Rocky Road
Level 12 Encounter (3,500 XP)
 2 hill giants (H)
 2 galeb duhr rockcallers (R)
 2 galeb duhr earthbreakers (E)
Set Up: The characters are traveling along an old dirt road in the wilderness
when they encounter a pair of hill giants and their galeb duhr slaves. This
might be just a random encounter along the way to some other destination,
or the characters might be looking for something in or under the old ruined
tower on the map in Figure 24-2. Winding stairs in the tower might lead down
to a tiny cellar or into the characters’ next dungeon adventure.
Read Aloud: A crumbling ruin that was once a round tower lies scattered on a
hilltop ahead. The road runs straight ahead and past the tower, steps cut into
the hillside. An old statue stands near the top of the steps, and for a moment you
might think the hulking figure near it is another statue — but then it moves.
Perception DC 19: Some of the boulders scattered across the hillside seem to
be moving!
Features: Special features of this area include the following:

 Trees: The three large tree trunks each fill one square, blocking move-
ment through those squares and providing cover to characters behind
them. A character can climb a tree with a DC 12 Athletics check.
 Shrubs: Smaller trees and shrubs in the area are difficult terrain. Tiny
plants that don’t fill a whole square have no effect on movement.
 Rocks and Statue: Squares full of large rocks block normal movement, but
a character can scramble over them at half speed with a DC 10 Athletics
check. The statue blocks two squares and gives cover to creatures
behind it. 
 Rubble: The rubble and other debris in and around the tower are difficult
terrain.
 Pool: The shallow pool is difficult terrain. 
Giant and Galeb Duhr Tactics: The galeb duhrs are hiding at the start of the
encounter, looking just like the boulders that litter the field. They rely on this
disguise only until the characters get close enough to attack.
The giant in the tower begins by hurling rocks, while the one outside gets
into melee immediately. The galeb duhr rockcallers lead off with earthen
grasp against player character defenders or leaders, and then they roll into
melee. The giants attack restrained characters with their superior reach
while the galeb duhr earthcallers use ranged attacks against player character
strikers and controllers.

Chapter 24: Ten Paragon Encounters
Set Up: Figure 24-3 shows a ruined tomb that is the object of a githyanki raid.
The raiders have opened a vortex from their Astral home into this dungeon,
where they are seeking some relic that lies in an ancient sarcophagus. What
is it they seek? It might be some remnant of their race’s past, or an item they
believe can help them against their mind flayer foes — or something they
plan to use to conquer the world.
Read Aloud: An eerie blue light gleams on stone walls far ahead. The hallway
opens into a larger chamber, its floor split asunder in some ancient earthquake.
Four gaunt humanoids are spread around the room. Two of them are standing
near a huge stone sarcophagus, eyeing it with interest.
Features: Special features of this area include the following:
 Chasm: The chasm here is 60 feet deep. A creature who falls in takes
6d10 damage. Climbing out requires a DC 18 Athletics check.
 Astral Vortex: The swirling vortex of energy at the north end of the map
is linked to the Astral Sea. A creature in the vortex has concealment and
can make an Arcana check (DC 20) as a move action to teleport any-
where on the map. After teleporting, the creature has the insubstantial
and phasing qualities until the start of its next turn. (This works just like
the githyanki gish’s astral stride power, except that the range is greater.)
The vortex disappears 5 minutes after the start of the encounter.
 Rocks and Rubble: Squares full of large rocks block normal movement,
but a character can scramble over them at half speed with a DC 10
Athletics check. Rubble is difficult terrain.
 Sarcophagus: The large stone sarcophagus is the object of the githyanki’s
raid. A character can clamber over it with a DC 14 Athletics check. 
Githyanki Tactics: The githyanki warriors use telekinetic grasp and sustain it
as long as they can to keep characters near the entrance and away from the
sarcophagus. They engage the characters they have immobilized to gain
increased damage against those targets with their silver greatsword attacks.
The mindslicer tries to stay out of melee. As soon as any character crosses
the chasm, he flees toward the Astral vortex so he can better avoid character
attacks. He uses psychic barrage as often as it recharges, as long as he can
catch at least two characters in its area.
The gish leads off with a storm of stars attack against four different charac-
ters, and then uses force bolt as often as it recharges. He uses astral stride
every round to gain the benefit of being insubstantial, teleporting from char-
acter to character to do heavy damage with double attack where he’s least
expected.

Read Aloud (Left Side Doors): Behind a pair of doors carved with images of
snakes and snake-headed humanoids, you find what looks like a temple com-
plex. A great fire burns in an urn nearby, and flickering light to the right suggests
a similar blaze in a larger room in that direction. That room seems to wind
around and might connect up with the other set of doors behind you. A snake-
headed figure who might have stepped right out of one of the door carvings
stands behind the fiery urn, pointing a twisted staff in your direction.
Read Aloud (Right Side Doors): Behind a pair of doors carved with images of

An ornate carpet that looks hundreds of years old adorns the floor. An enormous
snake with a humanoid torso coils on the carpet, holding a scimitar and shield at
the ready, looking like something that stepped out of the door carvings to attack
you. To the left, flickering firelight illuminates what seems to be a fairly large room
that winds around, probably connecting up with the other set of doors behind you.

Features: Special features of this area include the following:
 Fire Urns: A creature pushed into one of the fire urns takes 3d10 fire
damage, and a creature that starts its turn in an urn takes 10 fire
damage. A character can tip an urn over with a DC 20 Strength check,
making an attack in a close blast 2: Dexterity versus Reflex, 1d10 fire
damage.
 Snake Pit: The yuan-ti keep a pit full of venomous snakes, where they
offer sacrifices to Zehir by throwing victims into the pit. A creature that
starts its turn in the pit takes 2d10 poison damage and ongoing 5 poison
damage (save ends).
Yuan-Ti Tactics: The abominations are the front-line fighters of this group of
yuan-ti, and they move to intercept the player characters as soon as possible,
shielding the malisons to the best of their ability. They use grasping coils to
hold their opponents in place. 
The malison incanter hurries from its starting position to get behind an
abomination right away so it can benefit from its deflect attack power. It uses
poisoned domination to control a player character defender (preferably) or
striker that is taking ongoing poison damage from an abomination’s attack. 
The malison disciple of Zehir fights alongside the abominations, taking
advantage of flanking positions and using its soothing words to dominate a
player character defender or leader.

with his cyclops servitors. These caves might be part of the Feydark, or the
fomorian party might be raiding into the caverns of the natural world. Or the
characters might pass unknowingly from a dungeon in the world to the cav-
erns of the Feydark, with no clear means of return.
Read Aloud: The walls of these caves are warped and gnarled like the roots of
an ancient tree, and the ceilings rise high above the relatively level ground. A
wide tunnel opens suddenly into a gigantic cave with more wide passages lead-
ing off in three directions. An enormous, hideously twisted giant hunches in the
middle of the cave, turning a baleful eye in your direction and emitting a wheez-
ing, rumbling sort of laugh. There’s a hint of movement from the other passages
as the giant hefts his mace and readies himself for battle.
Fomorian Tactics: The fomorian and the cyclopses don’t coordinate their
attacks together very effectively. Each creature chooses its own target and
attacks that target in preference to all others. The fomorian uses evil eye on a
player character defender, and uses skullcracker to deal extra damage to that
character as long as he or she remains immobilized. The cyclops ramblers
strike at individual targets and shift quickly away using Feywild alacrity and
the benefit of their evil eye power. The cyclops storm shaman tries to catch
multiple characters in its storm burst, but otherwise combines its evil eye and

Cyclops Ramblers (2)
Cyclopses are the willing servants of the fomorian rulers of the Feydark, believing the misshapen
giants are divine. They stand about 14 feet tall and have a single, glaring eye above their noses.
These cyclops ramblers wear chainmail and carry oversized greatswords.

Fomorian Warrior
A fomorian is an enormous and hideous giant. It would stand nearly 30 feet tall if it could stand
upright, but its posture is hunched and twisted in hideous deformity. Its skin is purple-gray and it
lacks any hair on its warped limbs or disfigured head. Its right eye is larger than the other and unnat-
urally blue compared with the steel gray of the other eye. Its right eye is the “evil eye” that it fixes
on its chosen target in melee. The fomorian wears hide armor and swings a mace appropriate to
its enormous size.

Drow Scourge
Level 16 Encounter (7,800 XP)
 Drow priest (P)
 3 drow warriors (W)
 Goristro demon (G)
Set Up: The drow are so much viler than even the most uncaring of their elf
and eladrin kin that it’s hard to categorize the depth of their evil, but possibly
their worst quality is that they regularly work and fight alongside demons.
Figure 24-6 shows an underground shrine where the drow pay their respects
to the Demon Queen of Spiders, their favorite goddess Lolth. 
Read Aloud: Hundreds of spiders skitter along the walls and floor of this pas-
sage, drawn inexorably forward toward whatever lies ahead. Some are as small
as the head of a pin, and some are bigger than your outstretched hands, but they
ignore you, scurrying away from your footsteps on the ground and marching
around or over obstacles in their way. Firelight flickers on the stone walls of a
large room ahead, and you can see spiders continuing to stream onward
through that room. But then you see something huge come into the light, some-
thing like a giant with the head and massive horns of a bull. It sniffs the air and
roars, and you see smaller humanoid forms behind it skulking in the shadows.
Features: Special features of this area include the following:
 Spiders: Spiders from across the region stream to the statue of Lolth and
disappear through a crack beneath it. The spiders have no actual effect
on the encounter — they’re only here for flavor, unless you decide other-
wise. Their escape route might suggest that there’s a secret tunnel
beneath the statue that the characters could find, for example, leading
them to their destination farther below.

 Fire: A creature pushed into the fire takes 3d10 fire damage, and a crea-
ture that starts its turn in the fire takes 10 fire damage.
 Statue and Blood Rock: A statue of Lolth, appearing as a spider with the
head of a female drow, stands in the back chamber of this area. It blocks
movement through its four squares, although a creature can climb up
onto and over it with a DC 20 Athletics check. A creature adjacent to the
statue can score a critical hit with any of its attacks on a natural roll of
19 or 20.
 Alcove: A statue of a winged demon holds a basin of water in this alcove. 
 Acid Pool: A shallow pool of bubbling green acid dominates the side
chamber to the right of the entrance. A creature that enters or starts its
turn in the pool takes 2d10 acid damage and ongoing 5 acid damage. 
Drow and Demon Tactics: The goristro demon charges into melee combat. It
charges (using goring charge) any time it has a chance to push a character
into either the acid pool or the fire, even if it provokes opportunity attacks
from a closer opponent. It doesn’t leave the large open area near the
entrance.

Chapter 24: Ten Paragon Encounters

The drow priest uses pain web to hamper characters engaged with the
goristro, making their attacks less effective and keeping them from moving
into better positions. The drow warriors use stealth and flanking to gain
combat advantage against the characters, avoiding anything approaching a
fair fight. They make use of the back passage to get out of sight and to move
around to advantageous positions.
When the demon falls, any surviving drow retreat to the statue of Lolth, rely-
ing on the blood rock to turn the tide of battle in their favor. The drow priest
uses spider link to heal herself and Lolth’s wrath to punish the warriors for
their failure to defeat the characters.

Part V: The Part of Tens
Drow Priest
The evil race of drow are defined by their devotion to the evil goddess Lolth, and the priests of Lolth
rule drow society — if it’s possible to call the suspicion and treachery these chaotic evil priests
foment anything like society. This priest wears fine chainmail, and the head of her mace suggests
the shape of Lolth’s spider-web symbol.

Drow Warriors (3)
Drow warriors are deadly combatants, but they’re not soldiers. Like all drow, they thrive on treach-
ery and stealth, taking advantage of every unfair opportunity that arises in a fight. They wear chain-
mail, because heavier armor would interfere too much with stealth, and they carry rapiers and hand
crossbows (with 20 bolts each). Their weapons are coated with a spider-derived poison that knocks
victims unconscious.

Diabolic Legion
Level 17 Encounter (8,600 XP)
 Bone devil (B)
 2 ice devils ( I )
 4 legion devil veterans (L)

343
Chapter 24: Ten Paragon Encounters
Set Up: An invasion force of devils has secured a foothold in the world, per-
haps in the service of some evil church or possibly on the direct orders of
Asmodeus or one of his archdevils. Figure 24-7 shows a map of their beach-
head, which might be a few rooms within a larger dungeon, a part of a great
fortress or crumbling ruin, or a secret foothold beneath a human city.
Read Aloud: These chambers are lit by raging fire. As the hallway opens up,
you see sinister figures to either side. On the left, a giant figure with an insect-
like head and spiked tail stands in front of a curtain of flame stretching from
wall to wall. On the right, a humanoid in spiked plate armor brandishes a sword
at you and snarls over its shield, revealing a mouth full of sharp fangs. Another
of the bug-headed devils stands behind it, and you see light as if from another
enormous flame.
Features: Special features of this area include the following:
 Curtain of Fire: The thin curtain of fire on the right side of the map deals
3d8 fire damage to any creature passing through it, and 2d8 fire damage
to a creature that starts its turn adjacent to the curtain. The bone and
ice devils pass through the curtain freely, since their fire resistance is
sufficient to ignore its damage. The legion devils avoid the curtain or
teleport through it. A bone or ice devil adjacent to the curtain can use a
minor action to turn off the fire until the end of its next turn.
The curtain blocks line of sight for nondevils, but the devils in this area
can see through it.
 Fire Storm: The thicker wall of fire on the left side of the map burns
hotter as creatures move within it, surrounding them with flame. A crea-
ture that enters a square within the fire storm takes 10 fire damage. Each
Figure 24-7:
When hell
breaks
loose, its
fires burn in
unexpected
places.

square the creature enters deals damage, so a character that passes
directly through the storm takes 20 damage in two separate attacks. The
legion devils can move freely through this storm because their fire resis-
tance negates each attack of 10 damage, and the bone and ice devils can
ignore the damage as well. 
The fire storm blocks line of sight for devils and nondevils alike.
 Mark of Asmodeus: The symbol of Asmodeus burns in eldritch fire on the
floor of the largest chamber. A devil in contact with the mark deals an
additional 5 fire damage with any attack that deals damage. A nondevil
that enters or starts its turn in a square of the mark takes 2d10 fire
damage.
Devil Tactics: The devils in the outer chambers make a fighting withdrawal to
the inner chamber in response to the characters’ attack. The bone devil uses
fiendish focus through the curtain of fire to weaken characters that engage
the ice devil. It shifts away from adjacent characters to use fiendish focus
without provoking opportunity attacks and then uses double attack with its
superior reach to attack a character suffering from a defense penalty.
The ice devils try to use chilling command on any characters suffering from
the bone devil’s poison sting or fiendish focus. Their preferred position is just
outside the bone devil’s aura of obedience, with their enemies just inside its
aura of fear.
The legion devils pull together at the start of the encounter, with the ones in
the outer chambers moving through the fire storm to reach the inner cham-
ber. They take up a position in tight formation to benefit from the defense
bonus of their squad defense ability.

 Fire giant forgecaller (F)
 2 firebred hell hounds (H)
 Azer beastlord (A)

347
Chapter 24: Ten Paragon Encounters
Set Up: Three fire giants, with their pet hell hounds and azer servant, guard
their sacred site, a scar in the earth where the fiery power of the Elemental
Chaos bubbles into the world. Figure 24-8 shows the site of this sacred forge,
where the giants pay homage to the titans of the Chaos.
Read Aloud: The mighty doors swing open to reveal a cavernous room bathed
in lurid red light. A black-skinned giant with hair and beard of fire stands right
by the door, raising its sword as it whirls to face you. Two more giants are in the
room, and a living fire in the shape of a hound stands near another pair of doors
set in the left wall.
Features: Special features of this area include the following:
 Chaos Chasm: A creature that falls into or starts its turn in the lava-filled
chasm takes 4d10 fire damage. If a bloodied creature ends its turn in the
chasm, it is transported to the Elemental Chaos. The creature finds itself
in a lake of fire in the Chaos and takes another 4d10 fire damage at the
start of its turn. If the creature heals so it is no longer bloodied, it can
fight its way back through the portal to the world by making a successful
Arcana check (DC 25).
Figure 24-8:
The forge is
where the
giants
themselves
were made.

 Fire Urn: A creature pushed into the fire urn beside the chasm takes
3d10 fire damage, and a creature that starts its turn in the urn takes 10
fire damage. A character can tip the urn over with a DC 20 Strength
check, making an attack in a close blast 2: Dexterity versus Reflex, 1d10
fire damage.
 Statue and Rubble: The giant-sized statue near the door blocks four
squares. The rubble near the chasm and in the hall is difficult terrain.
 Forge: The large forge in the smaller chamber to the left holds a blazing
fire. A creature pushed into the forge takes 3d10 fire damage, and a crea-
ture that starts its turn in the forge takes 10 fire damage.
Giant and Azer Tactics: The fire giants move to engage characters near the
doorway, but they leave room for the hell hounds to move around the fray
and flank characters. The forgecaller stays back near its starting position,
using flame burst indiscriminately (because the fire damage can’t hurt any of
its allies). 
The hell hounds move up to fight alongside the giants, maneuvering into
flanking positions. The azer beastlord uses on my command as soon as both
hell hounds are within the power’s 5-square range. Under the azer’s leader-
ship, the hell hounds use their fiery breath carefully, avoiding catching their
giant allies in the blast since their fire resistance isn’t high enough to negate
all the damage.

Death’s Chill
Level 19 Encounter (12,800 XP)
 Ice archon frostshaper (F) 
 3 ice archon rimehammers (R) 
 2 ice archon hailscourges (H)
Set Up: Archons were made to serve as the legions of the Elemental Chaos
when the primordials warred with the gods at the birth of the world. Today
they still serve as armies for the various warlords and potentates of the
Chaos, including titans and efreets. Come to the world on some mission of
conquest, these ice archons have made a temporary lair in the small cluster
of rooms shown in Figure 24-9. Or perhaps the characters are in the
Elemental Chaos, infiltrating the stronghold of a mighty lord who uses
archons as guards, and this is their watchpost.
Read Aloud: Ice covers the walls, floor, and ceiling of the hall as it opens into a
cluster of small rooms. It’s hard to find sure footing, but the creatures you see
ahead of you don’t seem to have any trouble. They’re made of ice, clad in blue
steel armor and bearing weapons of the same material.
Ice: A character who runs or charges in this encounter area must make a DC
15 Acrobatics check or fall prone at the midpoint of the move. 
Ice Archon Tactics: The archons fight together as a skilled unit, complement-
ing each other’s abilities. The rimehammer soldiers move to form a barrier
between the characters and the other archons. Because of their icy ground
aura, characters can’t shift around them, so two archons can effectively
block the 20-foot-wide passage with a square between them, allowing the
third rimehammer to move into a flanking position or attack characters that
are hanging back from the front line.

352
Part V: The Part of Tens
The frostshaper fights just behind the rimehammers, hurling icy bursts and
loosing ice javelins at targets behind the front rank of characters.
Occasionally it uses ice blade against front-line characters to recharge its icy
burst attack. Its icy aura effectively prevents characters from shifting any-
where near it, helping the rimehammers maintain control of the front line.
The hailscourges hang back from melee, using hail storm as often as possible.
They don’t worry about catching allies in the area of the hail storm, because
the other archons are effectively immune to the cold damage of that attack.
They use double attack to target single characters, focusing on characters
that are avoiding melee.

Ice Archon Frostshaper
Ice archons are human-sized elemental soldiers formed of solid blue and white ice. They wear
breastplates and helms made of icy steel that helps define their humanoid shape. Instead of legs,
they move about on pillars of ice that let them skate effortlessly over the icy ground. The frost-
shaper forms blades of ice from the water in the air, either wielding them in melee or hurling them
at enemies.

Winter Hunt
Level 20 Encounter (15,600 XP)
 Ghaele of winter (G)
 Treant ( T )
 3 wild hunt hounds (H)
Set Up: The noble eladrin of the Feywild aren’t always friendly to visitors,
and that’s particularly true of the cold-hearted ghaeles of winter, who view
mortals as interlopers in a world where they don’t belong and can never fit
in. Figure 24-10 shows the location of a ghaele’s ambush. The characters

355
Chapter 24: Ten Paragon Encounters
might be traveling through the Feywild when the ghaele and her allies attack
them, they could be seeking the ghaele or some treasure in her possession,
or they could be looking for the cave where the ghaele happens to be hiding.
Read Aloud: A hound begins to bay as you approach — a magnificent creature
with glowing yellow eyes and sleek, patterned fur. You see two similar creatures
nearby, among the trees — and then notice that one of the trees is moving!
Features: Special features of this area include the following:
 Trees: The three large tree trunks each fill one square, blocking move-
ment through those squares and providing cover to characters behind
them. A character can climb a tree with a DC 15 Athletics check.
 Shrubs: Smaller trees and shrubs in the area are difficult terrain. Tiny
plants that don’t fill a whole square have no effect on movement.
 Rocks: Squares full of large rocks block normal movement, but a charac-
ter can scramble over them at half speed with a DC 10 Athletics check. 
Fey Tactics: The fey don’t fight a straightforward, toe-to-toe fight. The treant
is the most likely to stand still in combat (partly just because of its size),
while the hounds dart in and out of combat with mobile melee attack, claim-
ing combat advantage when they can by flanking or attacking opponents
knocked prone by the treant’s earthshaking stomp. The ghaele hangs back
near the cave entrance and uses freezing ray. She uses chilling defiance and
imperious wrath in the same round if she has multiple foes within 3 squares of
her, and fey step or flight to avoid characters who get too close.

Chapter 25
Ten Things to Avoid When DMing
K
eeping track of all the things you’re supposed to be doing (or not doing)
when you’re behind the DM screen can be hard. You’re supposed to be
the unquestioned master of a 1,000-page game system . . . and a riveting story-
teller, talented worldbuilder, and passable amateur thespian, to boot.
You’re going to make a goof at some point, so in this chapter, we list some of
the DMing don’ts you should try hardest to avoid. These list items are Big
Picture problems that many DMs struggle with, not details of how the rules
work or what’s actually in the game.
Don’t Get Attached to Your Villains
When you spend hours crafting interesting, powerful, and charismatic villains
for your game, you can easily get attached to your favorite bad guys. It’s
especially easy when you’ve worked all week to come up with a great story-
line featuring that villain as the principal nemesis of the heroes for your next
game. You might be tempted to go to some effort to prevent the player char-
acters from beating your mastermind before they’re “supposed to.”
Here’s our advice: Don’t ever cut your villains a break. The stars of the story
are the player characters, and if the players outwit you or just blunder into
victory through sheer dumb luck, you need to let them win.
Don’t Try to Kill the PCs
Back in the dark old days of gaming, many Dungeon Masters cultivated a rep-
utation as “killer DMs.” They’d gloat over how tough their dungeons were,
what sort of mortality rate they achieved, and exactly how they humbled
even the most cocksure and disrespectful players by mincing, mashing, or
flat-out disintegrating their characters.

Here’s the deal: Killing a character is nothing to be proud of, because anyone
can do it. You can do in the heroes any time you like by dropping death traps
or monsters far above their power level into the adventure. Try throwing a
sphere of annihilation or a nightwalker at a party of 1st-level characters if you
don’t believe us. On second thought, don’t do that; just trust us that it’ll
mean game over.
You don’t win anything when one of your monsters or traps kills a player
character. There might be times in your game (possibly even most of the
time) when you’re indifferent to character deaths and let the dice fall where
they may — but don’t ever go gunning for the player characters. Clever,
vicious, or evil monsters may certainly do so within the constraints of a fair
and balanced encounter, but you shouldn’t.
Don’t Let the Players Become 
Too Frustrated
The ultimate measure of a successful D&D game is simply: “Did everybody
have fun?” If the players get stuck on a particular obstacle, opponent, or dead
end and become frustrated, you should intervene.
360
Part V: The Part of Tens

If you’re crafty enough, the players might not even realize that you’re helping
them because the exact form of your intervention doesn’t even seem to be
helpful. For example, imagine that the party is stuck in a dungeon room, con-
fronting a door that they can’t open until they solve a puzzle. The players
can’t figure it out, and they’re getting bored and frustrated — so you inter-
vene by suddenly throwing a couple of wandering monsters into the room.
You might have had no intention of giving the players a fight at this point in
the adventure, but now you’ve changed the challenge. And, if the player char-
acters discover a clue when they defeat the monsters, the players might not
even suspect you’re tossing them a softball to help them beat the puzzle.
Don’t Compete with Other Entertainment
Wherever and whenever you set up the game session, avoid playing while the
players are distracted by something else. For example, don’t try to run your
game while a couple players are over on the couch playing a video game, or
at the computer instant-messaging other friends, or keeping an eye on the
football game. D&D works best when you have the full use of the players’
imaginations, and you need their undivided attention for that.
If you find yourself trying to run the game with a truly unavoidable distrac-
tion (maybe the Big Game is on the TV in the other room, and several players
are really trying to keep half an eye on it), consider calling a break. Wait until
the players are ready to pay attention to the game before resuming.
Don’t Overcomplicate the Encounter
What’s better than a memorable villain or monster? Two memorable villains
or monsters! Three! Four! With arrow traps, and a lightning storm, and an icy
cliff the player characters are trying to climb!
Well, not really. The best encounters need only a group of monsters about the
same size as the player character group, plus one or two interesting terrain
elements, traps or hazards, or other special effects. Anything beyond that
becomes hard to keep track of for everyone.
Don’t Play Favorites
You’re only human, so it’s inevitable that you like some of the characters the
players bring to the game more than others. For that matter, you might just
like some players better than others (especially if your significant other is in
your game group). Be careful not to show preferential treatment at the table.
361
Chapter 25: Ten Things to Avoid When DMing

Don’t Give the Players Everything . . .
Players like it when their characters get rewarded. You might be tempted to
make sure the players like your game by giving their characters frequent and
powerful rewards — quick level-ups, powerful NPC allies, or great hauls of
magic items.
In our experience, players enjoy the rewards their characters gain much
more if they have a sense that their characters really earned them. To keep
the players interested in your game, make sure that they stay a little hungry.
If they aren’t anxious to get to the next reward because you’ve already given
it away, they have little motivation to play.
. . . But Don’t Be Stingy, Either
Conversely, the players deserve and expect regular rewards from your game.
Without a sense that their characters are indeed making progress and becom-
ing more capable and powerful, the players might begin to wonder why
362
Part V: The Part of Tens

they’re showing up. If a fighter in your game reaches 6th level and is still
toting around the scale mail and longsword he started with at 1st level,
you’re keeping that player from enjoying some of the fun the game promises.
Reward success appropriately, and the players can’t help but come back to
your game with just the right balance of hunger for the next big thing and real
satisfaction at the progress they’ve already made. To make sure you’re hand-
ing out treasure at the right rate, refer to Chapter 7 in the Dungeon Master’s
Guide.
Don’t Sit There Like a Lump
You can easily fall into the habit of parking behind your DM screen, reading
the adventure’s boxed text, and announcing attack results without any partic-
ular inflection. Some people are naturally low-key, and even a high-energy DM
can show up for a game tired or distracted. We don’t expect you to deliver
riveting lines every time you speak, but you need to make yourself the center
of attention to be an effective and engaging DM. That often means standing
up, moving around, and speaking with some animation and excitement.
Deliver your own colorful commentary when you’re narrating a combat. If the
ogre swings and misses, pantomime a gigantic swing and say something like,
“Wow, Jozan, that would’ve taken your head clean off your shoulders if it had
landed! Good thing you ducked!”
Don’t Center the Game on One Player
Don’t let one player do all the talking. If your gaming group includes a loud,
expressive, or flamboyant roleplayer who wants to engage every NPC he
meets in deeply immersive conversations, keep an eye on how the other play-
ers react. When you go one-on-one with a single player at the table, no one
else is playing D&D — they’re watching their fellow player play. You might
also run into this with a player who’s more of a power gamer than a role-
player; perhaps she insists on doing all of the thinking, planning, and leading
in the party. Go out of your way to keep less assertive or confident players
just as involved as the extrovert.
One of the classic ways a selfish player seizes the spotlight is to insist that
his character is going to go off and do his own thing, regardless of what the
rest of the party decides. Typically, that forces less assertive players to cave
in to his plan or puts you in the awkward spot of trying to DM two separate
parties at the same time. The next time the overly assertive player does this,
363
Chapter 25: Ten Things to Avoid When DMing

let him go off and separate from the group. Then, instead of using cut-aways
to give him equal time with the rest of the group, ignore him as much as pos-
sible. Give him a couple minutes of playing time every 20 or 30 minutes, stick-
ing with the rest of the group and following their adventure for the rest of the
time. When Mr. Assertive figures out that he’s playing less D&D, he ought to
come around.

Chapter 26
Ten Things to Do All the 
Time When DMing
K
eep these ten suggestions in mind whenever you run a D&D game.
They’ll help you keep your eye on the big picture and make you a better
Dungeon Master. You won’t have a chance to use all these suggestions simul-
taneously, but watch for opportunities to put them into play in your game
sessions.
Be Prepared
Review the rules. Know your adventure. Be prepared.
It all boils down to doing a little before-game reading and being organized.
Gather your adventure materials and notes before the game. Collect the
miniatures you want to use ahead of time. Mark the sections of any rulebooks
or Monster Manuals you plan to use in the game session. The players expect
you to be ready to run the adventure when the group meets up, and if you’re
prepared, everything will run that much more smoothly.
Provide Various Challenges
Don’t just present combat encounter after combat encounter in your adven-
tures. Player characters and roleplaying games can’t survive on combat
alone. You need to present encounters to challenge all character types, test-
ing the skills and brains and roleplaying abilities of the players and their
characters, at least every so often. This gives every character a chance to
shine at some point in the adventure, and variety helps make your adven-
tures more dynamic and satisfying.

Start Each Session with Action
As often as possible, kick off each game session with some kind of action.
Whether you drop the player characters into the middle of a fight, start off
with a chase, provide the means for a breathtaking escape, or let them wit-
ness some awe-inspiring or terrible event, starting with action leads to excite-
ment, and excitement leads to a good game session.
Look for Opportunities
Because you never know what the player characters are going to do, you
have to keep an open mind and look for opportunities to translate their
actions back into your plot. For example, the players might decide that some-
thing you never thought of is really behind the whole adventure. If it sounds
good to you, work it in! Look for places to drop hints and seeds that lead to
future adventures. And always try to make it look like you planned it 
all along, even if you just thought of it thanks to something the player 
characters did.
366
Part V: The Part of Tens

Exude Drama in Your Descriptions
Be entertaining. When you set the scene and describe the action, use evoca-
tive language, stand up, sit down, point, lean, talk slowly, talk fast, talk loud,
whisper, explain what characters see, hear, feel, and smell. In other words, do
whatever is dramatically appropriate to get the scene across to the players in
a colorful, fun, and informative manner.
Use Visual Aids
Maps, play surfaces, miniatures, music, and handouts of all descriptions help
add context and texture to the imaginations of you and the players. A picture
is worth a thousand words and helps you quickly get across the information
you’re trying to impart. So, use visual (and audial) aids. They’re good for the
game. And they’re fun, too.
Be Responsive
Take cues from the players. If your description is running on and the players
are beginning to get bored or fidgety, cut it short and move on. If they seem
to need more information, provide it. If they really want to get to the action
now, have a wandering monster show up or have the villains kick in the door.
So, be responsive to the needs of the players, and you will be rewarded with
attentive and excited play.
Be Consistent
When you create house rules, write them down. When you make a ruling on
something in a rulebook that you and the players don’t think is clear, make a
note of it. When you describe a nonplayer character (NPC) that the player
characters (PCs) meet, note any pertinent details so that you can play that
NPC the same way the next time they encounter him or her.
In short, be consistent as a rules referee and as a narrator. It makes for a
better game, builds trust, and helps encourage the fun.
367
Chapter 26: Ten Things to Do All the Time When DMing

Be Impartial
Impartially interpret the rules, whether you’re ruling on something for the
player characters or the monsters. The players won’t trust you if you play
fast and loose with the rules, or if you play favorites, or if you cheat to help
out your favorite monster or NPC. And if they don’t trust you, your game
group will collapse. Where’s the fun in that?
Have Fun
Relax! D&D is a game. There are no tests or pop quizzes. There aren’t any
right or wrong ways to play the game, because you can alter things to your
own style and taste. In the end, D&D provides a fun activity that’s part story-
telling and part wargame. Have fun with it, and the players will have fun, too!
