Introduction
L
ying just off the tip of Florida and stretching southeast across
258,998 sq. km (100,000 sq. miles) of the Atlantic Ocean, The
Bahamas are often called the South Sea Islands of the Atlantic. Many of
The Bahamas’ thousands of miles of perfect coral sand beaches remain
free of footprints.
Charting its own course from Britain since 1973, the archipelago is made
up of a landmass of 700 islands. The prospect of deciding which island is
right for you isn’t as daunting as that figure suggests. Most of the islands —
or islets, in some cases — aren’t inhabited. Of those islands that are
inhabited, only a few are graced with places to stay.
Don’t come here looking for mountainous interiors like the ones found in
Jamaica or Puerto Rico. Instead of hills, The Bahamas offer seascapes that
seem to stretch forever. For the most part, beaches of white, golden, or,
in some rare cases, pink sands ring the islands. If you’re flying over them
like a bird, you can see translucent waters shimmering in the sunlight —
pale aquamarine, blue sapphire, or what an aerial photographer once
called “dancing green.”
Entire books containing only photographs of these swirling water pat-
terns have been published. As more and more of the world’s seas
become polluted, the Bahamian waters alone make this island nation
worth a trip.
In Bahamas For Dummies, 4th Edition, we help you discover the islands,
focusing on the high points but also warning you about some of the low
points. Of course, we hit all the hot spots, like the well-touristed Nassau,
Paradise Island, and Freeport/Lucaya on Grand Bahama Island. But we
also take you to the less-visited and harder-to-reach islands, such as the
Exumas in the southern Bahamas, perfect for those visitors seeking an
escape for some serious R & R.
About This Book
You can use this book in three ways:
 As a trip planner: Whether you think you know where you want to
go in The Bahamas or you don’t have a clue, this book helps you
zero in on the right island (or islands) for you. Expect plenty of
insider advice — the kind you’d get from a trusted friend — about

cheapest airfare, to figuring out a budget, to packing like a pro. All
the chapters are self-contained, so you don’t have to read them in
order. Just flip to them as you need them.
 As an island guide: Pack this book alongside your sunscreen and
it’ll come in just as handy while you’re away. Turn to the appropri-
ate island chapters whenever you need to find the best beaches, a
tasty place to eat, a great snorkel or sail, a challenging golf course,
a hot nightspot, or tips on any other diversions.
 For an overview: If you want a feel for The Bahamas, peruse this
guide from start to finish to figure out which of the archipelago’s
pleasurable pursuits are right for you.
Be advised that travel information is subject to change at any time —
and this is especially true of prices. We suggest that you write or call
ahead for confirmation when making your travel plans. The authors, edi-
tors, and publisher cannot be held responsible for the experiences of
readers while traveling. Your safety is important to us, however, so we
encourage you to stay alert and be aware of your surroundings. Keep a
close eye on cameras, purses, and wallets — all favorite targets of
thieves and pickpockets.
Conventions Used in This Book
Bahamas For Dummies is a reference guide that allows you to read 
chapters in any order you want. Instead of providing guidebook 
“hieroglyphics,” the book is user-friendly, keeping abbreviations and
symbols to a minimum.
The following credit card abbreviations noted are used for the establish-
ments that accept them:
 AE: American Express
 DC: Diners Club
 DISC: Discover
 MC: MasterCard
 V: Visa
Dummies Post-it® Flags
As you’re reading this book, you’ll find information that you’ll want to reference as you
plan or enjoy your trip — whether it be a new hotel, a must-see attraction, or a must-
try walking tour. Mark these pages with the handy Post-it® Flags included in this book
to help make your trip planning easier!

We use $ signs to indicate the costs of hotels and restaurants so that you
can quickly determine whether you want to unpack your luggage at a
hotel or dine on the local cuisine (see the price table later in this section).
The $ system lists a range of costs so you can make fast comparisons.
The rates we use in our hotel recommendations are for two guests
spending one night in a standard double room during the high season,
which lasts from mid-December to mid-April. In the off season, tariffs are
sometimes lowered anywhere from 20 to 60 percent.
Most rates listed include only the room. In some cases, however, the
stated price includes breakfast. And in the rare cases of all-inclusive
hotels, the rates we present may initially seem very high, but we note
that one price includes everything: your room, meals, drinks, and all
those extra expenses, such as tips, taxes, most activities, airport pick-
ups, and returns for your departing flight. For restaurants, we give the
price range for a main course per person.
The following table shows the system of $ signs that we use to indicate
a range of costs for one night in a hotel or the price of a dinner main
course at a restaurant.

Foolish Assumptions
We made the following assumptions in preparing this guide:
 You may be a first-time visitor to The Bahamas in need of the “build-
ing blocks” to help you create a trip at a price that you can afford.
 You may have been to The Bahamas before, but you haven’t
explored them in a long time and you want sound advice about
what’s new and good and what’s changed since your last trip.
 You’re a busy person and don’t want to read a lot of background
and less-than-urgent information. After all, a vacation shouldn’t be
homework. You want a book that focuses quickly on the places
that’ll give you the best experience in the islands.
 Finally, we assume that you’re seeking value — that you want to get
the biggest bang for your buck in The Bahamas. So we help you
steer clear of pricey tourist traps.
If you fall into any of these categories, Bahamas For Dummies is for you.
Introduction 3

How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into seven parts. The chapters within each part
cover specific subjects in detail. You don’t have to read this book in any
particular order. In fact, think of these pages as an island buffet: You can
consume whatever you want, and no one cares whether you eat the
guava duff for dessert before you consume the conch chowder.
Part I: Introducing The Bahamas
In this part, we offer our opinions on the best attractions and experiences
The Bahamas have to offer, and we give you an overview of Bahamian
customs, music, festivals, cuisine, and “thirst-busters.” We also compare
and contrast the most popular islands of The Bahamas so that you can
decide which place (or places) best suits your tastes. Sure, they all have
gorgeous beaches, but that’s where the similarities end.
We also tell you the best and worst times of the year to travel to The
Bahamas. We explain high season (when prices go up) and low season
(when prices go down again), and we highlight the advantages and dis-
advantages of traveling during these times of year. We also provide a 
calendar of events in case you want to plan your trip to coincide with
a festival, tournament, or local holiday.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to The Bahamas
Part II lays out everything you need to know about how to plan a worry-
free trip. Because money is a primary consideration, we tell you how to
access your funds, and we provide tips on how you can stay within your
budget. We also help you decide how to travel to The Bahamas. If you’re
flying, you discover how to get hold of the best fares, or if you’re travel-
ing by cruise ship, we show you how to link up with some of the best
deals for your “floating hotel” to The Bahamas.
To help you plan a stay that’s tailored to your preferences, we explain in
detail the various accommodations awaiting you, from simple Bahamian
inns and guesthouses to mega-resorts. We offer trip-planning tips for
newlyweds, soon-to-be-newlyweds, families, singles, gays and lesbians,
seniors, and travelers with disabilities. You also find out everything you
need to know about the boring but vital stuff, such as getting a passport
and purchasing travel insurance.
Parts III through VI: The Islands
These parts are where we dish out the main course. The chapters in
Parts III through VI are the juiciest morsels of the book because they’re
packed with all the fun stuff that makes a vacation a vacation. For each
island or island group — New Providence, Grand Bahama (Freeport/
Bahamas For Dummies, 4th Edition

Lucaya), the Abacos, the Eleuthera chain (including Harbour Island), the
Exumas, Bimini, San Salvador, and some of the less-visited islands for
escapists — you get the lowdown on hotels, what to expect when you
arrive (from landing at the airport to dealing with local taxi drivers),
what restaurants to try and, of course, where to go and what to do,
including beaching it.
For each island, we include a section called “Fast Facts.” These quick
tips give you handy information that you may need, including phone
numbers to use in an emergency, where to find area hospitals and phar-
macies, where to find ATMs, and more. For the bigger islands, you find
“Fast Facts” at the end of the “Settling In” chapters. For the smaller
islands, you can locate them at the ends of the chapters.
Part VII: The Part of Tens
As in every For Dummies book, this lighthearted part is just for fun.
We share our ten favorite island experiences with you, along with ten
common myths about The Bahamas.
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout this book, icons highlight useful information. Here’s what
each symbol means:
Keep an eye out for the Bargain Alert icon as you seek out money-saving
tips and great deals.
Best of the Best highlights the best the destination has to offer in all 
categories — hotels, restaurants, attractions, activities, shopping, and
nightlife.
Watch for the Heads Up icon to identify annoying or potentially danger-
ous situations, such as tourist traps, unsafe neighborhoods, monetary
rip-offs, and other things to beware.
Look to the Kid Friendly icon for attractions, hotels, restaurants, or 
activities that are particularly hospitable to children or people traveling
with kids.
When you see the Tip icon, you find useful advice on things to do and
ways to schedule your time.
The Worth the Search icon points out secret discoveries or useful
resources that are worth the extra bit of effort to find.
Introduction 5

Where to Go from Here
Nothing’s like a vacation in the islands — when you plan it with the right
advice and inside tips, that is. Whether you’re a veteran traveler or a
rookie, this book helps you put together just the kind of trip you have in
mind. So, start turning these pages, and before you know it, you’ll feel
that warm island breeze on your face.

n The Bahamas, you can island-hop by boat or scuba dive along what
some devotees believe are the remains of the lost continent of Atlantis.
Or perhaps your idea of a perfect island vacation is to plunk yourself
down on a pink-sand beach with a frosted drink in hand. Whether you’re
looking for adventure or relaxation — or a bit of both — this chapter
points you to the best The Bahamas has to offer. Throughout the book,
look for the “Best of the Best” icons that highlight our picks.
The Best Beaches
 Cable Beach (New Providence): This crescent-shaped, sandy,
6.5km (4-mile) strip of shoreline is even better than Paradise
Island’s Cabbage Beach, which is more crowded. The prime beach-
front strip of Cable Beach came into prominence during the
post–World War II boom on the island, and today the beach is a
beehive of activities ranging from water-skiing to banana-boat
rides. Cable Beach isn’t always kid-safe, however — during the
winter months waters are sometimes rough. See Chapter 13.
 Cabbage Beach (Paradise Island): The sandy strands of Paradise
Island, across the waters from New Providence, are called Cabbage
Beach (no one’s quite sure how the beach got its name). Cabbage
Beach is the showpiece of Paradise Island; a spectacular strip of
sand running in front of the swanky Ocean Club Resort that’s ideal
for swimming, sunning, and watersports, such as Jet-Skiing and

parasailing. The big drawback to this beach is that it’s overcrowded
in winter. There’s no admission charge, but non-guests may be
charged to use the facilities of hotels along the beach. Cabbage
Beach stretches for 3km (2 miles), rimming the north coast from
the Atlantic lagoon all the way to the intimate Snorkeler’s Cove.
See Chapter 13.
 Xanadu Beach (Grand Bahama): In Samuel T. Coleridge’s Kubla
Khan, Xanadu is an idyllic, exotic, and luxurious place, and so is
this aptly named stretch of white sands. Xanadu Beach is located
on the most populated sector of this sprawling island and is con-
venient to the resorts of Freeport and Lucaya. The surf is most
often tranquil, and the white sands stretch for 1.6km (1 mile).
During the winter, Xanadu Beach is crowded, but it’s a year-round
magnet, with kid-friendly waters from spring to fall. The best water-
sports on the island are here. See Chapter 17.
 Tahiti Beach (Elbow Cay): Think South Pacific in The Bahamas.
Lying at the far southern end of remote Elbow Cay Island in the
yachting haven of the Abacos, this relatively undiscovered beach is
Paradise Found. After three days on this strip of white sands, you
lose all sense of time and space, and may be tempted to devote the
rest of your life to beachcombing. The sands of Tahiti Beach are set
against a backdrop of thick walls of palm trees. See Chapter 19.
 Treasure Cay Beach (Treasure Cay): Tucked away on a remote
island in the Abacos, Treasure Cay Beach is one of the best beaches
in The Bahamas, or even the Caribbean. Treasure Cay Beach is so
large — 5.5km (21⁄2 miles) — that you never feel crowded, even
during the high season. Nowhere else in the Abacos (or most any-
where else) can you find sand this soft and white. Unpolluted water
in striking shades of blue and green washes up on this peaceful
shore. See Chapter 21.
 Pink Sand Beach (Harbour Island): In our view, no beach in the Out
Islands — or even in Nassau, Grand Bahama, or Paradise Island —
tops this lovely strip of pink sands that stretches for a whopping
5km (3 miles). Swimming is idyllic year-round because the natural
harbor is protected by reefs that break up the turbulent sea’s waves.
Going sunning in the morning is best because afternoon can be a
bit shadowy. See Chapter 22.
 Ten Bay Beach (Eleuthera): These golden sands, lying just north of
Savannah Sound, are waiting for your beach towel. Don’t expect
watersports kiosks, fast-food stands, and vendors pushing handi-
crafts. Instead, expect relatively undiscovered sands opening onto
generally tranquil waters. In the 1960s, this beach was one of the
most fashionable in The Bahamas, but the exclusive clubs that
once flourished here are long gone, leaving . . . well, the beach.
See Chapter 23.

The Best Places to Get Away from It All
 One&Only Ocean Club (Paradise Island; % 800-321-3000 or
242-363-2501): This hideaway is the most exclusive on New
Providence and the adjoining Paradise Island. A true pocket of
posh, the Ocean Club was once a private club owned by A&P zil-
lionaire Huntington Hartford, but today it’s a glitzy sanctuary of 
elegance and charm. Surrounded by splendid terraced gardens, it
offers a country-club ambience, prime beachfront, and gourmet
dining. See Chapter 11.
 Viva Wyndham Fortuna Beach (Grand Bahama Island; % 242-373-
4000): Away from the hordes of Freeport or Lucaya, this resort
hotel sits on 11 hectares (26 secluded acres) and opens onto one of
the best white sandy beaches on the island. A stay at this hideaway
on the water is like being in a world far removed from bustling
Lucaya. Like an Italian version of Club Med. See Chapter 15.
 Hope Town Hideaways (Elbow Cay; % 242-366-0224): This series
of gingerbread villas lies across the harbor from where the ferry-
boats from Marsh Harbour arrive. The “hideaways” in this resort’s
name is apt. It is reached only by boat and lies on its own 11-acre
site. The grounds are beautifully landscaped and some of the
villas are large enough to sleep six guests comfortably. See
Chapter 19.
 Green Turtle Club & Marina (Green Turtle Cay; % 800-963-5450
or 242-365-4271): Boasting the most complete yachting facility in
its archipelago, this resort is one of the most charming of the “in”
spots. Green Turtle Club has some of the best fishing and diving
facilities. The villas include kitchens, and standard rooms are deco-
rated in the colonial style. Two small, white sandy beaches are
within walking distance. See Chapter 20.
 Treasure Cay Hotel Resort & Marina (Treasure Cay; % 800-
327-1584 or 242-365-8801): Boaters, golfers, fishermen, divers,
yachties, and just plain escapists retreat to this luxurious resort
on remote Treasure Cay. This resort boasts 5.5km (31⁄2 miles) of
spectacular sandy beach, and guests stay in privately owned
condos when the owners aren’t using them. The standout attrac-
tions here are the superb 18-hole golf course and the 150-slip
marina. See Chapter 21.
 Pink Sands (Harbour Island; % 800-OUTPOST or 242-333-2030):
Posh and sophisticated, this plush hideaway opens onto a 5km 
(3-mile) stretch of pink sandy beach sheltered by a barrier reef.
This luxury resort features a main house and one- and two-bedroom
villas spread across 10 hectares (25 acres) of property. This resort
serves the best meals in Harbour Island. See Chapter 22.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of The Bahamas 11

 Four Seasons Resort Great Exuma at Emerald Bay (Exuma; % 800-
819-5053 or 242-366-6800): The grandest resort to open in the Out
Islands, this 183-room resort is waking up this sleepy archipelago,
whose tranquil waters are loved by yachties. At the Four Seasons’
centerpiece is an 18-hole golf course designed by Greg Norman,
and the resort’s full-service spa and health club is also the finest in
the Out Islands. See Chapter 24.
 Club Med–Columbus Isle (San Salvador; % 800-CLUB-MED or
242-331-2000): One of the most remote — and luxurious — Club
Meds in the Western Hemisphere opens onto one of the most pris-
tine beaches in the southern Bahamas. This getaway attracts tennis
buffs along with scuba divers, honeymooners, and escapists. Other
enticements include the lavishly decorated public lounges and the
supremely comfortable bedrooms. See Chapter 25.
The Best Honeymoon Resorts
 Sandals Royal Bahamian Hotel (New Providence; % 800-SANDALS
or 242-327-6400): If you’re “any couple in love,” you can receive the
most lavish and catered honeymoon in New Providence or Paradise
Island. The way to go, of course, is to book one of the 27 secluded
honeymoon suites with semiprivate plunge pools. The staff handles
on-site wedding celebrations, and you’re supplied with everything
from the minister to the flowers, not to mention champagne and a
wedding cake. See Chapter 11.
 Wyndham Nassau Resort & Crystal Palace Casino (New Providence;
% 800-222-7466 or 242-327-6200): If you and your loved one want
glitter and bright lights instead of romantic isolation, this mega-
resort is for you. Honeymooners flock here for its wide array of
drinking, dining, and gambling options. Of course, when it’s time to
put up the DO NOT DISTURB sign and retreat to a king-size bed, that’s
all right, too. Ask about honeymoon package deals. See Chapter 11.
 Dunmore Beach Club (Harbour Island; % 800-891-3100 or
242-333-2200): The quintessential elegant hideaway. Dunmore
Beach club stands on its own 3.2 hectares (8 acres) of landscaped
rooms and opens onto the most beautiful beach in The Bahamas —
and pink at that. You sleep in romantic cottages with private patios
and can use the hot tubs in the units to get better acquainted with
your mate. See Chapter 22. 
 One&Only Ocean Club (Paradise Island; % 800-321-3000 or
242-363-2501): On lush acres between the golf course and a white
sandy beach, this resort is a chic — though costly — address.
Ocean Club is a haven of tranquillity, with fine dining, formal gar-
dens, luxury rooms and suites, and even reflecting pools that
stretch toward a cloister assembled stone by stone from Europe.
No staff on the island pampers honeymooners more, but if you
Part I: Introducing The Bahamas 
12

want to be left alone with your mate, the staff gently retreats. See
Chapter 11.
 Abaco Inn (Elbow Cay; % 800-468-8799 or 242-366-0133): For bare-
foot elegance in the sands and romance, this sophisticated little
hideaway is one of the gems of the yachting haven known as the
Abacos. Luxury villa suites with sunrise and sunset views are the
way to go. If you and your loved one find a hammock in the gar-
dens, the day is yours. See Chapter 19.
 Bluff House Beach Hotel (Green Turtle Cay; % 800-745-4911 or
242-365-4247): This hotel, located in a romantic spot on a secluded
beach, is an escapist’s dream. The hotel has a nautical charm with
British colonial overtones. The best honeymoon accommodations
are the spacious suites, with cathedral ceilings and balconies over-
looking the Sea of Abaco, and a beach nearby. The 4 hectares
(10 acres) on which the hotel sits are some of the most desirable
real estate in The Bahamas. See Chapter 20.
 Pink Sands (Harbour Island; % 800-OUTPOST or 242-333-2030):
This resort is the one place in all The Bahamas where we’d person-
ally go for a honeymoon. Chris Blackwell, who brought reggae star
Bob Marley to world attention, created the most sophisticated
hideaway in the Out Islands. It opens onto the pink sands of one of
the country’s greatest beaches, which stretches for 5km (3 miles).
The inn’s luxurious accommodations are set on an 11-hectare 
(28-acre), beautifully landscaped estate. See Chapter 22.
The Best Family Resorts
 Radisson Cable Beach Resort (Cable Beach; % 800-333-3333 or
242-327-6000): A well-organized kids’ camp lures families to this
sprawling 691-room resort, which opens onto some of the best
sands along Cable Beach right outside Nassau. The resort’s chil-
dren’s activities are the best organized on New Providence (though
they’re nowhere near the equal of Atlantis on Paradise Island).
An added plus is that many of the bedrooms contain two double
beds, making them suitable for families of four. Dining is no prob-
lem here because of the vast array of possibilities. See Chapter 11.
 Atlantis Paradise Island Resort & Casino (Paradise Island; % 800-
ATLANTIS or 242-363-3000): Imagine yourself and your kids washed
up on the shores of the lost continent of Atlantis. The Bahamas
don’t offer any other choices that are more fun for a family vacation
than this sprawling mega-resort, a true fantasy world that’s nautical
with a vengeance. The children’s programs (for ages4–12) are the
most spectacular in the country. Better yet, kids can spend hours
cavorting through a “sea world” of underground grottoes that sprawls
across 5.7 hectares (14 acres) and includes aquariums, underwater
viewing tunnels, and cascading waterfalls. See Chapter 11.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of The Bahamas 13

 Ritz Beach Resort (Lucaya; % 242-373-9354): Think Disney on
Grand Bahama Island. Surrounded by semi-tropical gardens, the
Ritz is in the midst of all the fun, next door to a water park and the
Pirates of The Bahamas Theme Park (all that’s missing is Johnny
Depp). Efficiencies, one-bedroom suites, or multi-level studio pent-
houses with private pools are available to suit the needs of your
family. See Chapter 15.
 Lofty Fig Villas (Marsh Harbour; % 242-367-2681): This family-
owned bungalow colony is for self-sufficient types who want more
of a Robinson Crusoe holiday. Vacationing families meet like-
minded people around the outdoor barbecue or the freshwater
pool. Each bungalow comes with a fully equipped kitchen and a 
private screened-in porch. See Chapter 18.
 Banyan Beach Club Resort (Treasure Cay; % 888-625-3060 or
242-365-8111): Right on a beach that’s widely hailed as one of the
world’s top ten, this resort offers spacious condos that are well
suited for families. All the condos come with complete kitchens,
and you can get burgers and hot dogs served at the beach bar and
grill. For larger families, two-bedroom accommodations with an
additional sleeping area are available. See Chapter 21.
 Four Seasons Resort Great Exuma at Emerald Bay (Great Exuma;
% 800-819-5053 or 242-366-6800): This resort is the only major
resort in the Exumas, or in all the southern Bahamas, that caters
to families, and it does so exceedingly well with its well-organized
children’s programs. If your budget allows, book one of the idyllic
beachfront properties that has one or two bedrooms. The array
of activities, the great beaches, the wide variety of dining options,
and the overall comfort make this resort a winning choice. See
Chapter 24.
The Best Restaurants
 Chez Willie (Nassau; % 242-322-5364): One of the most elegant
and romantic restaurants in New Providence, Chez Willie recap-
tures some of the magic of Nassau in the 1940s during the heyday
of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. The host, Willie Armstrong, is
the epitome of graciousness, and the French and Bahamian cuisine
is elegantly presented and beautifully prepared. See Chapter 12.
 Sun and . . . (Nassau; % 242-393-1205): This restaurant, which
serves Continental (mainly French) cuisine and seafood, is a
Nassau classic with an overlay of British charm. The chef uses
exceptional products along with a finely honed technique in the
kitchen and is known for his to-die-for soufflés. See Chapter 12.
 Sole Mare (Cable Beach; % 242-327-6200): The most elegant
choice for dining on the beachfront strip outside Nassau also
serves the finest Northern Italian cuisine on island. Candlelit tables
Part I: Introducing The Bahamas 
14

and a guitarist playing soft tunes add to its romantic allure. See
Chapter 12.
 Dune (Paradise Island; % 242-363-2501, ext. 64739): This elegant
dining choice is located on the lobby level of the chic Ocean Club.
French-born master chef and restaurant guru Jean-Georges
Vongerichten created this fine dining experience. With its trendy
décor and sweeping view of the ocean, Dune is a study in culinary
classicism, where flavors, aromas, and textures are perfectly com-
bined. See Chapter 12.
 Bahamian Club (Paradise Island; % 242-363-3000): A notch down
from the superb Dune, this strictly upscale establishment is one of
the leading restaurants in The Bahamas and is our favorite at the
sprawling mega-resort of Atlantis. It presents a superb French and
international cuisine nightly against a backdrop that evokes the
British colonial era. The restaurant serves the island’s finest cuts
of meats. See Chapter 12.
 Rock House Restaurant (Harbour Island; % 242-333-2053): On the
increasingly chic Harbour Island, the restaurant in the Rock House
Hotel serves superb international cuisine. Its hip bodega aura evokes
Miami, but it’s thoroughly grounded on the island. At lunch you can
get a rock lobster sandwich, but at night the chefs display their
culinary prowess with an array of satisfying dishes. See Chapter 22.
The Best Diving
 New Providence: Right off the coast of Nassau lies a spectacular
underwater world with many stunning dive sites that offer a
panorama of rainbow-hued fish, large sponges, and a wide variety
of coral reef life along with ocean holes, wrecks, old shipwrecks,
caves, and cliffs. One of the greatest dive sites is Shark Wall, which
is 16km (10 miles) off the coast of New Providence. Other good dive
sites are Southwest Reef, Razorback, Booby Rock Reef, and Rose
Island Reef.
The coastline of New Providence, called “the best-kept diving
secret in The Bahamas,” is home to some fascinating wrecks that
you can explore in shallow water, including the Mahoney and the
Alcora. The Never Say Never Again wreck was a backdrop for the
James Bond film: A 34m (100-ft.) freighter, seized as a drug runner,
was sunk by the film crew. Nearby, you can explore the remains of
an airplane prop created for another Bond thriller, Thunderball. The
best outfitter is Bahama Divers (% 242-393-5644). See Chapter 13.
 Grand Bahama: On Grand Bahama, you can hook up with
Underwater Explorer’s Society (UNEXSO; % 800-992-DIVE or
242-373-1244), which is one of the premier dive outfitters in The
Bahamas. Its escorted dives include a series of dramatic reef trips,
shark dives, shipwreck dives, and even night dives. See Chapter 17.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of The Bahamas 15

 Theo’s Wreck (Grand Bahama): This is one of the most famous
wrecks in The Bahamas, and it lies off Freeport. The site is ideal for
photo ops. In 1982, the 70m (230-ft.) freighter was deliberately sunk
just to attract marine life. It succeeded: The wreck teems with sea
turtles, moray eels, eagle rays, and horse-eyed jacks, among other
creatures of the deep. For spur and groove coral beds, you can also
explore other dive sites, including Gold Rock, Pygmy Caves, and
Silver Point Reef. If you’re an experienced diver, you can explore
these sites independently; otherwise, hook up with the previously
recommended UNEXSO. See Chapter 17.
 Marsh Harbour: You can explore the Abacos Train Wreck in 4.5 to
6m (15–20 ft.) of water. This wreck consists of two almost-intact loco-
motives lying on their sides. Another wreck in the area, Adirondack,
also lies in shallow water some 3 to 7.5m (10–25 ft.) deep. Marsh
Harbour is also the jumping-off point for the government-protected
Sea Preserve and Fowl Cay Land, both teeming with sea life in
shallow reefs. Divers have actually kissed barracudas here (not rec-
ommended!). Look for “The Towers,” two coral towers rising 23m
(75 ft.). The best outfitter is Dive Abaco (% 800-247-5338 or
242-367-2787). See Chapter 18.
 Exuma Cays Land and Sea Park: A major attraction of The Bahamas,
this park, inaugurated in 1958, is the first of its kind in the world.
The 35km-long (22-mile), 13km-wide (8-mile) natural preserve
attracts scuba divers to its 453 sq. km (175 sq. miles) of sea gar-
dens with spectacular reefs, flora, and fauna. You can access it
only by boat. See Chapter 24.
 San Salvador: Some of the best diving in the southern Bahamas
centers around this remote island, which is the site of Riding Rock,
a dive resort, and a Club Med. Some 40 well-preserved dive sites
are no more than 45 minutes away by boat from either resort.
You can experience wall diving here — diving amid stunning sea
walls at sites where the coral reef drops steeply. The underwater
photography is great here, and you can even arrange to night dive.
The best outfitter is Guanahani Dive Ltd. (% 242-331-2631). See
Chapter 25.
The Best Snorkeling
 New Providence/Paradise Island: Most of the big hotels and
resorts at Cable Beach and on Paradise Island lend or rent snorkel-
ing equipment. A number of intriguing sights await you, especially
at Love Beach on New Providence. Also attracting snorkelers are
such areas as Rose Island Reefs, Booby Rock Channel, the Goulding
Reef Cays, and Gambier Deep Reef, plus some underwater wrecks
lying in shallow water. Bahamas Divers (% 242-393-5644) can give
you the most helpful advice on snorkeling possibilities. The com-
pany’s branch on Paradise Island is located at the Sheraton Grand
Part I: Introducing The Bahamas 
16

Resort (% 242-393-8724). Also consider Hartley’s Undersea Walk
(% 242-393-8234), which allows you to walk through an underwa-
ter world. See Chapter 13.
 Grand Bahama: Resort hotels on island can hook you up with snor-
keling excursions, such as the ones offered by Ocean Motion Water
Sports Ltd. (% 242-374-2425), which is the best outfitter for snor-
keling. In addition, the outlet can connect you with any number of
other watersports, from banana-boating to water-skiing. The clear
water around Grand Bahama is wonderful for snorkeling because it
has a rich marine life. Snorkelers are fond of exploring Ben’s Cave, a
stunning cavern that’s part of Lucayan Caves, as well as the coral
beds at places like Silver Point Reef and Gold Rock. See Chapter 17.
 Elbow Cay: With its 209km (130-mile) string of beautiful cays and
some of the best beaches in The Bahamas, the Abacos are ideal for
snorkeling, especially in the waters off Elbow Cay. Visibility is often
great because the cay lies close to the cleansing waters of the Gulf
Stream. Mermaid Beach, a particularly colorful reef, is a favorite.
Sea Horse Boat Rentals (% 242-367-2513) provides equipment
and the best snorkeling advice. See Chapter 19.
 Green Turtle Cay: Because the Abacos have one of the world’s
largest barrier reefs, the island chain — and especially Green
Turtle Cay — is a snorkeler’s delight. Some of the colorful reefs
start at depths of just 1.5m (5 ft.). Immerse yourself in a world
of schools of fish along with coral caverns, huge tube and barrel
sponges, and fields of elk and staghorn coral. Snorkelers can con-
tact Green Turtle Divers (% 242-365-4271) or Brendal’s Dive
Center (% 242-365-4411). See Chapter 20.
 Stocking Island: George Town is the capital of Exuma, which is 
celebrated for its crystal-clear waters so beloved by yachties.
From George Town, Stocking Island lies across Elizabeth Harbour,
which is only 1.5km (1 mile) away. Stocking Island is a long, thin,
barrier island that attracts snorkelers who explore its blue holes
(ocean pools of fresh water floating on heavier salt water). The island
is also ringed with undersea caves and coral gardens in stunning
colors. Stocking Island also has some of the most gorgeous white-
sand beaches in the southern Bahamas. See Chapter 24.
 San Salvador: Following in the footsteps of Columbus, snorkelers
find a rich paradise on this relatively undiscovered island, with its
unpolluted and unpopulated kilometers and kilometers of beaches
that are ideal for swimming, shelling, and close-in snorkeling.
A week’s stay is enough time to become acquainted only with the
possibilities, including Bamboo Point, Fernandez Bay, and Long
Bay, which are all within a few kilometers of Cockburn (the main
settlement) on the western side of the island. At the southern tip
of San Salvador is one of our favorite places for snorkeling, Sandy
Point, and its satellite, Grotto Bay. See Chapter 25.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of The Bahamas 17

The Best Fishing
 New Providence/Paradise Island: The waters around New
Providence are thick with game fish. In-the-know fishermen long
ago learned the best months to pursue their catches: November
through February for wahoo found in the reefs, June and July for
blue marlin, and May through August for the oceanic bonito and
blackfin tuna. Nassau is ideal for sportfishing. Most boat charters
allow their passengers to start fishing within 15 minutes after leav-
ing the dock. The best outfitter is Born Free Charters (% 242-393-
4144), where anchoring and bottom-fishing are also options. See
Chapter 13.
 Grand Bahama: Off the coast, the clear waters are good hunting
grounds for snapper, grouper, yellowtail, wahoo, barracuda, and
kingfish. The tropical waters along Grand Bahama lure anglers in
search of “the big one” because the island is home to some of the
biggest game fish on earth. Many fishermen catch dolphins (not the
Flipper kind, though). And Deep Water Cay is a fishing hot spot.
The best outfitter is Reef Tours, Ltd. (% 242-373-5880). See
Chapter 17.
 Green Turtle Cay: The deep-sea fishing possibilities off the coast
of this cay draw anglers from all over the world. An abundance of
giant game fish as well as tropical fish live in these beautiful waters.
Both dedicated fishermen and more casual sportfishermen come to
the little island, seeking yellowfin tuna, a few dolphinfish, and the
big game wahoo, among other catches. Green Turtle Cay boasts
some of the best fishing guides in The Bahamas: weather-beaten
men who’ve spent a lifetime fishing the surrounding waters. The
best place to hook up with one of these guides is Green Turtle
Club (% 242-365-4271). See Chapter 20.
 Treasure Cay: In the Abacos, some of the best fishing grounds are
in the sea bordering this remote island. At the Treasure Cay
Marina (% 242-365-8250), fishermen from all over the world hire
experienced skippers to take them out in their searches for bar-
racuda, grouper, yellowtail, snapper, tuna, marlin, dolphinfish, and
wahoo. Deep-sea, sea-bottom, and drift fishing are yours for the
asking. The cay’s own bonefish flats are just a short boat cruise
from the marina. See Chapter 21.
 Exuma: Anglers from all over America descend on this beautiful
archipelago for deep-sea or bottom-fishing. Fishermen hunt down
kingfish, wahoo, dolphinfish, tuna, and bonito in the deepest
waters off the coastline of the Exumas. Many visitors also fly here
just to go bonefishing. Among other outfitters who can hook you
up with fishing outings is Club Peace & Plenty (% 242-345-5555),
which rents the necessary equipment and can arrange experienced
guides to accompany you. See Chapter 24.

The Best Sailing
 New Providence: Although sailing in the waters off New Providence
isn’t the equal of yachting-favorites the Exumas and the Abacos,
boaters can still find much to delight in. More organized-boating
excursions are offered in New Providence than anywhere else in The
Bahamas, especially by outfitters, such as Barefoot Sailing Cruises
(% 242-393-0820) and Majestic Tours Ltd. (% 242-322-2606).
You can also choose from an array of sunset cruises, like the ones
Flying Cloud (% 242-393-4430) offers, which feature its fleet of
catamarans. The most popular — and the most scenic — trip is
sailing to tranquil Rose Island, which is 13km (8 miles) east of the
center of Nassau and is reached after sailing past several small
uninhabited cays. In addition, Blue Lagoon Island, 4.8km (3 miles)
northeast of Paradise Island, is a magnet for boaters because it
offers seven white-sand beaches along with seaside hammocks.
The drawback to this island, however, is that cruise-ship passen-
gers flock here and many beach buffs come over on day trips. See
Chapter 13.
 Grand Bahama: On the beautiful waters off this large island, you
can go sailing aboard Ocean Wonder (% 242-373-5880), which is
supposedly the world’s largest twin-diesel engine glass-bottom
boat. This boat offers the best and most panoramic view of under-
life off the coast of Grand Bahama Island — a view most often
reserved for scuba divers. You can also go sailing aboard Bahama
Mama, a two-deck 22m (72-ft.) catamaran, on a Robinson Crusoe
Beach Party. The catamaran also sails at sunset on a booze cruise.
Superior Watersports (% 242-373-7863) operates this catamaran.
See Chapter 17.
 Marsh Harbour: One of the finest anchorages in the Out Islands is
found in Marsh Harbour, which is called “The Boating Capital of
The Bahamas.” The Moorings (% 888-952-8420 or 242-367-4000) is
one of the leading charter sailboat outfitters in the world, renting
boats to sail the waters of the Abacos. Passengers discover white
sand beaches and snug anchorages on uninhabited cays. Sailing
here is one of the great experiences of visiting The Bahamas. See
Chapter 18.
 Exuma: Yachties flock to these beautiful sailing waters to see some
of the most dramatic coastal scenery in The Bahamas. The National
Family Island Regatta, the most popular boating spectacle in The
Bahamas, is held here annually. Most recreational boating is in the
government-protected Exumas Cays Land and Sea Park, an area of
splendid sea gardens and rainbow-hued coral reefs that stretches
south from Wax Cay to Conch Cay. You can rent motorboats at
Minns Water Sports (% 242-336-3483) in George Town. See
Chapter 24.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of The Bahamas 19

The Best Shopping
 Nassau: Nassau is home to more shops than anyplace else in
The Bahamas. If you’re seeking anything from a Swiss watch to
British-made china, you can find it at one of the shops along Bay
Street in the heart of Nassau. Some of the merchandise — but
hardly all of it — sells at discounts that range from 30 to 50 per-
cent. You can purchase a lot of the merchandise for the same price
or lower in your hometown, so the wise shopper who knows his
prices can make off with the bargain merchandise. Surprisingly,
goods actually made in The Bahamas are hard to come by. If you’re
in the market for Bahamian handicrafts, you can stroll by the famous
Straw Market in Nassau, but watch which items you pick up — that
handicraft may have MADE IN TAIWAN stamped on it. See Chapter 13.
 Grand Bahama: The only island in The Bahamas to rival the shop-
ping in Nassau is the Freeport/Lucaya area. Much of the same
merchandise that’s sold in New Providence — including international
imports of china, perfume, crystal, gemstones, or watches — is
also for sale here at virtually the same prices. We’re drawn more to
the Port Lucaya Marketplace these days than to the more famous
International Bazaar at Freeport. The situation at both markets is
very tricky. We’ve found merchandise 20 to 40 percent lower than
Stateside prices displayed along with so-called “discounted” and
“duty-free” products that were actually cheaper in our hometown.
See Chapter 17.
The Best Nightlife
 Cable Beach: The partying crowd packs the bars and restaurants
at the resorts along this beachfront strip at night. Most of the
action is around the Crystal Palace Casino (% 242-327-6200) in
the center of Cable Beach. This resort and casino obviously evoke
Las Vegas and stand up well when compared to other glittering
casinos in the Caribbean. See Chapter 13.
 Paradise Island: The most glamorous casino in The Bahamas is
Atlantis Paradise Island Resort (% 242-363-3000), which is the
largest casino in the Caribbean. When you tire of blackjack, you
can also join the party at the resort’s Dragons Night Club (see
Chapter 13). 
 Grand Bahama: Most of the after-dark diversions on this island spin
around its casino: the Isle of Capri Casino at the Westin & Sheraton
at Our Lucaya Resorts (% 242-373-1333). In winter, guests can catch
periodic stage shows, which pack the house with Las Vegas–style
revues. Another popular gathering place is Count Basie Square at
the Port Lucaya Marketplace, where musicians perform live three
nights a week. And did we mention that it’s free? See Chapter 17 for
more information about nightlife on Grand Bahama.

ollowing in the footsteps of Columbus, Ponce de León arrived in
The Bahamas searching for the legendary Fountain of Youth, which
led to the discovery of Florida and the Gulf Stream. Chances are your
own discoveries won’t be quite as legendary. But part of the fun of visiting
The Bahamas is getting a taste of island life — and that means listening
to Junkanoo music, eating conch prepared in countless ways, meeting
the friendly locals (who’d rather not be called “natives”), discovering
guava duff (our favorite dessert), finding the bar that makes the best
Bahama Mamas and, in general, putting yourself on “island time,” which
is one slow-moving clock.
In this chapter, we’ve assembled some easy-to-digest cultural 
information — historical background, culinary tidbits, local lingo, and
films or books you may want to check out before your trip — that we
hope will help you better appreciate your own island discoveries.
History 101: The Main Events
This island nation has an exciting history — a tale of conquistadors,
pirates, rumrunners, and post-colonial prosperity. Here’s the story.
The early years
Columbus first landed in the New World somewhere in The Bahamas on
October 12, 1492. He landed on an island called “Guanahani” by the local
inhabitants, who were Arawak Indians known as Lucayans. Columbus
renamed the island San Salvador. Over the years, exactly which island

Columbus landed on has been much disputed. Recent research places
the first landing on Samana Cay, 105km (65 miles) southeast of the island
that today is known as San Salvador. (Just to make things more confus-
ing, San Salvador is also sometimes called Watling Island.)
The Lucayans Columbus encountered are believed to have come to the
islands from the Greater Antilles in the eighth century A.D. They were
seeking refuge from the Carib Indians then living in the Lesser Antilles.
The Lucayans were peaceful people who welcomed the Spaniards and
taught them a skill soon shared with the entire seafaring world: how to
make hammocks from heavy cotton cloth.
The Spanish conquistadors, who claimed the islands for their king and
queen, didn’t repay the Lucayans kindly. Finding neither gold nor silver
mines nor fertile soil, the conquistadors cleared out the population of
the islands, taking some 40,000 doomed Lucayans to other islands in the
Spanish empire to work in mines or dive for pearls.
Ponce de León voyaged here in 1513 looking for the legendary Fountain
of Youth. His journey led to the European discovery of Florida and the
Gulf Stream — but not the magic fountain. Ponce de León’s historian
described the waters of the Little Bahama Bank — just north of Grand
Bahama — as bajamar (pronounced “bahamar,” which is Spanish for
“shallow water”). This word seems to be a reasonable source of the name
“Bahamas.” Other than this mention, however, practically no references
were made to the islands first discovered by Columbus for 135 years.
The coming of the English
England formally claimed The Bahamas — by then unpopulated — in
1629. No settling took place, however, until the 1640s, following a reli-
gious dispute that arose in Bermuda. Dissident English and Bermudian
settlers (known as the Eleutheran Adventurers) sailed to an island called
Cigatoo, changed the name to Eleuthera (from the Greek word for free-
dom), and launched a tough battle for survival. Many settlers became
discouraged and went back to Bermuda, but a few hardy souls remained,
living on fish and salvage from shipwrecks.
Other people from Bermuda and England eventually followed, and they
helped settle New Providence Island in 1656. They planted crops of
cotton, tobacco, and sugar cane and established Charles Towne (named
in honor of Charles II) at the harbor.
Pirates and privateers
The promising agricultural economy of The Bahamas was short-lived.
Several of the governors of The Bahamas during the late 17th century
were corrupt, and soon the island became a refuge for English, Dutch,
and French buccaneers who plundered Spanish ships. The Spaniards
repeatedly attacked New Providence for revenge, and many of the 
settlers left. Those settlers who remained found supplying the rich
Part I: Introducing The Bahamas 
22

pirates to be a good source of income. Privateers, a slightly more
respectable type of freebooter (they had their sovereign’s permission
to prey on enemy ships), also found the many islets, tricky shoals, and
secret harbors of the islands to be good hiding places from which they
could stage their attacks on ships sailing between the New and Old
Worlds.
Late in the 17th century, the settlers changed the name of Charles
Towne to Nassau to honor King William III, who also held the title Prince
of Nassau. At the time, some 1,000 pirates still called New Providence
their home base.
Finally, the appeals of merchants and law-abiding islanders in favor of
Crown control were taken seriously, and in 1717 the lord proprietors
turned over the government of The Bahamas, both civil and military, to
King George I, who commissioned Captain Woodes Rogers as the first
royal governor.
Rogers captured hundreds of the lawless pirates. He sent some pirates
to England to be tried; eight were hanged, and the king pardoned others
after they promised to lead law-abiding lives. Later, Rogers was given the
authority to set up a representative assembly, the precursor of today’s
Parliament. Despite such interruptions as the fledgling U.S. Navy captur-
ing Nassau in 1776 (for only a few days) and the Crown Colony surren-
dering to Spain in 1782 (which lasted almost a year), the government of
The Bahamas since Rogers’s time has been conducted in an orderly fash-
ion. In early 1783 under the Treaty of Paris, Spain permanently ceded
The Bahamas to Britain, ending some 300 years of disputed ownership.
Loyalists, blockade runners, and bootleggers
After the American Revolution, several thousand Loyalists from the
former colonies immigrated to The Bahamas. Some of the immigrants,
especially Southerners, brought slaves with them and tried their luck at
planting sea-island cotton in the Out Islands. Growing cotton was unsuc-
cessful (the plants fell prey to the chenille bug), but the former deep
South planters learned to fish, grow vegetables, and provide for them-
selves in other ways.
The first white settlers of The Bahamas also brought slaves with them,
but when slavery was abolished throughout the British Empire in 1834,
they were freed. The settlers achieved a fairly peaceful transition,
although many years passed before any real equality between blacks
and whites existed.
During the American Civil War, blockade running brought prosperity to
The Bahamas. Nassau became a vital base for the Confederacy, with ves-
sels taking manufactured goods to South Carolina and North Carolina
and bringing back cotton. The Union victory ended blockade running
and plunged Nassau into an economic depression.

Important dates in Bahamian history
700 Lucayans emigrate to The Bahamas from the Greater Antilles, seeking refuge from
the cannibalistic Caribs.
1492 Columbus makes his first landfall in the New World, traditionally said to be at San
Salvador, although many historians dispute this theory.
1513 Ponce de León searches for the Fountain of Youth and discovers the Gulf Stream.
1629 England claims The Bahamas, which were then destitute of population.
1640s The first Western settlements are established.
1656 New Providence Island (site of Nassau) is settled.
1717 King George I orders Captain Woodes Rogers, the first royal governor, to chase
the pirates out of Nassau.
1776 The fledgling United States Navy captures Nassau but soon departs.
1782 The British Crown Colony surrenders The Bahamas to Spain.
1783 Spain signs the Treaty of Paris, ceding The Bahamas to Britain.
1833 The United Kingdom Emancipation Act frees slaves throughout the British Empire.
1861–65 Blockade-running during the U.S. Civil War brings prosperity to The Bahamas.
1920–33 Rumrunning during Prohibition in the U.S. revives a slumping Bahamian econ-
omy. The 1920s are a busy and prosperous time for bootleggers.
1933 The repeal of Prohibition causes an economic collapse on the islands.
1940 The Duke of Windsor, after renouncing the British throne, becomes governor of
The Bahamas as war rages in Europe.
1964 Sir Roland Symonette becomes the country’s first premier. The Bahamas are
granted internal self-government.
1967 Lynden Pindling, named premier in a close election, begins a long, notorious reign.
1968 African-Bahamian rule becomes firmly entrenched.
1972 Bahamians vote for total independence from Britain.
1973 On July 9, the Union Jack in New Providence is lowered for the last time, ending
more than three centuries of British rule.
1992 After 25 years, controversial Prime Minister Pindling goes down in defeat. Hubert
Ingraham, campaigning against corruption and recession, replaces him.
1994 Hotel mogul and entertainer Merv Griffin sells Paradise Island properties.
1995 Developers of the famed Sun City complex in Swaziland become hotel czars of
Paradise Island.
2002 Perry Gladstone Christie becomes the third prime minister in the nation’s history.

The islands’ next real economic boom resulted from Prohibition in the
U.S. Just like the blockade runners who preceded them — only with
faster boats and more of them — rumrunners plied the waters between
The Bahamas and the southeastern U.S. From the enforcement of the
18th Amendment in 1920 to the repeal of that law in 1933, bootleggers
used Nassau, Bimini, and Grand Bahama as bases for running contra-
band alcoholic beverages across the Gulf Stream. The U.S. Coast Guard
and the bootleggers waged a ceaseless battle on each other. The repeal
of Prohibition dealt another shattering blow to the vulnerable Bahamian
economy.
The war, the duke, and the woman he loved
On August 17, 1940, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor arrived in Nassau
following his appointment as governor of the colony. The duke abdicated
his throne as King Edward VIII so he could marry the woman he loved,
the divorcée American Wallis Simpson. The people of The Bahamas were
shocked that such a once-powerful figure was assigned to govern their
impoverished colony, which was viewed then as a backwater of the
British Empire. The duke tried to bring self-sufficiency to The Bahamas
and provide more employment for its out-of-work population.
World War II healed the wounds left over from the bootlegging days.
The Bahamas served as an air and sea station in the Atlantic; as a
result, the country inherited two airports built by the U.S. Air Force.
The islands also were strategically important when Nazi submarines
intruded Atlantic coastal and Caribbean waters. Today, some of the out-
lying islands still house U.S. missile-tracking stations.
A declaration of independence
In the years after World War II, party politics developed in The Bahamas
as independence from Britain seemed more possible, and change came at
the ballot box. In 1967, Lynden Pindling won a close election to become
prime minister. During the general election of 1972, the Bahamian people
voted for total independence. The people of The Bahamas agreed to be a
part of the British Commonwealth, presided over by Queen Elizabeth II.
Her representative in The Bahamas would be a governor-general, a posi-
tion with mostly symbolic power. In 1992, after years of corruption under
Pindling and countless exposés in the Miami Herald, Hubert A. Ingraham
became prime minister. In office, he pledged to promote quality tourism
for his nation.
In May 2002, Perry Gladstone Christie led the Progressive Liberal Party
to victory, becoming the third prime minister to govern the island
nation. Public opinion seems divided on Christie’s reign. Many voters
praise him as a progressive, modern leader; others have attacked him,
including scorching editorials in The Nassau Guardian. Christie has been
accused of receiving a vast amount of campaign money from known drug
dealers, an accusation that the prime minister denies.

Building Blocks: Local Architecture
The unique geography and history of The Bahamas contributed to a dis-
tinctive architectural feature — the Bahamian clapboard house — that
is today one of the most broadly copied styles in the tropics. But this
design wasn’t perfected and standardized until the early 19th century.
The earliest clapboard-sided houses were usually angled to receive the
trade winds. Large window openings and high ceilings increased airflow,
and awning-style push-out shutters shaded the windows and helped
direct breezes indoors, even during rainstorms. Unlike larger, more
impressive houses where foundations were massive edifices of coral,
brick, or stone, the first floors of Bahamian cottages were elevated on
low stilts or light masonry pilings to allow more air circulation. Raising
the building also kept the floor joists, beams, and planks above flood-
waters during a hurricane surge.
Ruggedly built of timbers whose ends were often pegged (not nailed)
together and pinned to stone pilings several feet above the ground,
Bahamian-style clapboard houses survived when many rigid and
unyielding stone-built structures collapsed during hurricanes. Modern
engineers claim that the flexibility of these structures increases their
stability in high winds.
Within The Bahamas, you can check out some of the best-preserved and
most charming examples of the Bahamian cottage style in Harbour Island
(off the coast of Eleuthera) and, to a lesser extent, in Spanish Wells and
Green Turtle Cay.
Living on Island Time
Island clocks aren’t wound as tightly as clocks in other parts of the
world. Life in The Bahamas moves much more slowly than many visitors
are used to. Waiters, salespeople, and hotel desk clerks operate at what
some outsiders consider too leisurely a pace. Especially in Nassau and
Freeport, you may find some poorly trained, less-than-accommodating
staff members here and there. But getting annoyed is a waste of energy.
Most travelers soon learn to go with the flow and get in step with island
time. If you’re going to enjoy your vacation, you have to crank your
expectations about time — and sometimes service — down a notch.
Words to the Wise: The Local Language
Bahamian dialect has its own cadence and musical rhythm. Sometimes
an educated Bahamian dining with you will speak a lilting Queen’s
English and then suddenly lapse into Bahamian dialect when he hits
on an emotional subject.
Part I: Introducing The Bahamas 
26

Accents in The Bahamas resemble those of the Caribbean region, just
south of these Atlantic isles. However, a trained ear can easily pick up
the difference. Some Bahamians sound as if they were imported from
Brooklyn. For example, woik is what you do fuh a living, and a waiter
will soive you.
Sometimes the letters v and w are interchanged. “So you wisitin’, ay?”
translates into “So you’re visiting, are you?” If a Bahamian tells you he’s
going “spilligatin’,” he means that he’s planning to “carry on bad” — he
intends to party and have an all-out good time. If he says he wants “to
conversate” (a common Bahamian variation of the verb “to converse”)
with you for a while, he wants to chat.
Some of the Loyalist villages, such as the ones found in Eleuthera,
including Spanish Wells, retain certain pronunciations that were in
use in the England of Shakespeare’s day. For instance, the glass that
someone serves your rum punch in may be called a goblet.
Taste of The Bahamas: Local Cuisine
When it’s time to chow down in The Bahamas, settings range from
casual family-run restaurants featuring local treats to elegant candlelit
dining rooms offering gourmet international fare. The main source of
food is the ocean. The steak you order may be juicy, but it didn’t come
from an island cattle farm. Instead, it was flown in to the airport and
taken to the restaurant, along with lamb and other meats, as well as
most of the fruits and vegetables on your plate.
You find plenty of good food here and some mediocre eats as well —
imported or not. Menus throughout the islands are varied. You may dine
on an Indian or Greek appetizer one night, an Italian or Tex-Mex main
course another night, and a French dessert the next night.
Are you traveling with fussy kids? Don’t worry. Burgers and fries, pizza,
fried chicken, pasta, sandwiches, and other child-friendly fixings are
easy to find, especially in Nassau and Freeport/Lucaya, where you find
some fast-food chains.
For the tastiest, most authentic (and least expensive) island cuisine,
head to the smaller, locally run restaurants, where the home-style cook-
ing revolves around the sea. Even the so-called island dishes at the
larger hotels and restaurants have American and Continental influences.
Eating like a local
Restaurants specializing in island cuisine commonly serve conch, fish
(especially grouper), and lobster. Among other local favorites are crab
and rice, okra soup, chicken and dough (dumplings), mutton, wild boar,
and souse, but these dishes are harder to find outside of people’s
homes. If you stop by a local restaurant in the morning and see men
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into The Bahamas 27

eating souse or conch salad, chances are they’re trying to kill hangovers;
locals believe that the hot peppers do the trick.
In the dining sections of the chapters, we sprinkle in a number of local
eateries serving authentic and affordable Bahamian cuisine. In Nassau,
sample island cuisine at Shoal Restaurant and Lounge or the Bahamian
Kitchen (see Chapter 12). On Grand Bahama Island, bite down at
Beckey’s Restaurant & Lounge or Fatman’s Nephew (see Chapter 16).
After you reach many of the Out Islands, Bahamian food is all you can
order in some of the smaller places, except for a first-class resort here
and there, including the ones found on Harbour Island. Other top loca-
tions to check out island treats include
 Stands on Potter’s Cay, the dock beneath the Paradise Island exit
bridge on New Providence.
 Many restaurants in The Bahamas’ Out Islands (see Chapters 22
through 25).
 Kiosks during Bahamian festivals such as Junkanoo (at Christmas
and New Year’s) and the National Family Island Regatta (in George
Town, Exuma, in Apr).
It’s all about conch
The star of the culinary show is conch (pronounced “konk”). On every
island at the edge of the water near boat docks, you see huge mounds of
discarded conch shells — the kind with the shiny pink spiral interior
that you put to your ear to hear the waves. Residents claim that conch
gives men “strong back” — in other words, this tasty mollusk can raise
the roof in the boudoir. No wonder the meat is transformed into so many
local favorites, including
 Conch chowder: A rich, spicy soup with vegetables and bits of
conch.
 Conch fritters: Golf ball–sized fried appetizers made with chopped
conch, herbs, flour, baking powder, and water.
 Conch salad: Minced raw conch marinated in lime juice and mixed
with chopped onions and peppers.
 Cracked conch: Pounded until tender, battered, and deep fried like
a breaded veal cutlet.
 Scorched conch: Raw meat washed with seawater and lime juice,
cut into large pieces and scored with a knife, and then rubbed with
hot pepper and topped with sliced fresh tomatoes and onions.
(You may catch fishermen on docks preparing this delicacy.)
 Steamed conch: Tenderized by beating or boiling, and then cooked
with sautéed onions, bell peppers, hot peppers, thyme, tomatoes,
and sometimes okra or carrots.
 Stewed conch: Made with a seasoned, flour-thickened gravy.

Dining on other Bahamian favorites
Fish, another staple, turns up for dinner, lunch, and even breakfast.
Grouper and snapper are the usual suspects. Boil fish (cooked with salt
pork, onions, and green peppers) is a popular morning eye-opener
that comes with grits. Many places also often serve delicately sweet
johnnycake (a mildly sweet bread) on the side. Also eaten as the day’s
first meal is stewed fish that comes in a rich brown gravy. Steamed fish
(which may sound bland, but is far from it), however, isn’t eaten before
noon and is cooked with a tomato base.
Local lobster is a bit tougher than the Maine variety, but it’s prepared in
lots of tasty ways: steamed, breaded, sautéed in butter, or topped with
grated cheese. To make minced lobster — a Bahamian winner served in
the shell — chefs shred the meat and cook it with tomatoes, green pep-
pers, and onions.
A limited number of chickens are raised locally in The Bahamas, mostly
on Eleuthera. Chicken souse is a popular dish made with chicken, onion,
sweet peppers, bay leaves, allspice, and other ingredients, as the cook’s
imagination dictates. This dish simmers in a pot for about an hour; the
cook then adds lime juice, and it simmers a little longer. Pig’s feet souse
is also a favorite dish.
Goats and sheep are also raised on the Out Islands. On a menu, “mutton”
can refer to either type of meat and is often curried. Bahamians catch
wild boar on some of the islands and hunt game birds, such as ducks
and pigeons. They also eat raccoon stew.
Most meats, including pork, veal, and beef, are imported. Even with
these meats, however, Bahamian cooks show their ingenuity with inter-
esting variations. For example, at an Out Island inn, we recently enjoyed
pork that was marinated with vinegar, garlic, onion, celery tops, cloves,
mustard, and Worcestershire sauce and then baked and served with
gravy. Even a simple baked ham is given a Bahamian touch — cooked
with fresh pineapple, coconut milk, coconut flakes, mustard, honey, and
brown sugar.
Many vegetables are grown in The Bahamas; others are imported. If you
have a cucumber, you can be almost certain that it’s from one of Edison
Key’s farms in North Abaco. They supply cucumbers to not only their
own country, but also to about 5 percent of the stateside market.
Bahamians also grow their own sweet potatoes, corn, cassava, okra, and
peppers (both sweet and hot), among other produce. Lunch and dinner
come with heaping portions of peas and rice, potato salad, coleslaw, or
macaroni and cheese — and sometimes all of them.
Guava duff is the dessert specialty of The Bahamas. This dessert, which
resembles a jellyroll, is made with guava pulp that has been run through
a food mill or sieve. Nobody seems to agree on the best method of cook-
ing it. One way you can make this dessert is to cream sugar and butter,
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into The Bahamas 29

and then add eggs and spices, such as cinnamon and cloves or nutmeg.
Make a stiff dough by adding flour and mix the dough with the guava
pulp, which you then place in the top of a double boiler and cook over
boiling water for hours. You can also boil or steam the dough, and some
cooks insist that you bake it. Guava duff is served with hard sauce (a
blend of butter, confectioners’ sugar, vanilla, and rum).
Other tasty Bahamian desserts and breads include coconut tarts, benne
seedcakes, and potato bread.
Drinking island cocktails
Vacationers and residents alike satisfy their thirst with beer, much of it
imported from the U.S., Germany, and The Netherlands.
These imports have a higher alcohol content than the same brands of
foreign beer sold in the U.S. The Bahamas’ high-quality brew is called
Kalik, named for the sound cowbells make in Bahamian Junkanoo music.
If you’re not a beer drinker, colorful rum and fruit juice concoctions are
the rage. Depending on who makes them, the ingredients and propor-
tions vary; most bartenders won’t reveal the secrets of their success.
Besides rum punch, the top three tropical island cocktails are
 Bahama Mama: Vat 19 (a white rum), citrus juice (often pineapple),
bitters, a dash of nutmeg, crème de cassis, and a hint of grenadine
 Goombay Smash: Coconut rum, pineapple juice, lemon juice, Triple
Sec, Vat 19, and a dash of syrup
 Yellowbird: Crème de banana liqueur, Vat 19, orange juice, pineap-
ple, apricot brandy, and Galliano
Of course, you can find colas and other sodas, bottled (and sometimes
freshly squeezed) juices, and bottled water on all islands. Although tap
water is safe for brushing your teeth, most people drink bottled or fil-
tered water.
Jumping to Junkanoo
The Bahamians maintain great pride in their original musical idioms, often
comparing their vitality to the more famous musical traditions of Jamaica,
Puerto Rico, and Trinidad. Other than spirituals, which share roots with
slave music from colonial North America, by far the most famous musi-
cal products are Goombay and its closely linked sibling, Junkanoo.
Goombay music is an art form with melodies and body movements that
are always accompanied by the beat of goatskin drums and, when avail-
able, the liberal consumption of rum. The most outlandish expressions
of Goombay occur the day after Christmas (Boxing Day), especially in
Part I: Introducing The Bahamas 
30

Nassau on Bay Street. Dancers outfit themselves in masquerade cos-
tumes with bizarre accessories and glittering colors that evoke the
plumage of jungle birds. Goombay musicians and dancers are almost
always male, a custom dating from the days of slavery, and before that,
originating in West Africa. However, in the “Jump-In Dance,” performers
dance in a circle at the center of which a solo dancer performs. To the
rhythm of drums, the star dancer selects another person to take his
place. Today this person is likely to be a female, who will then dance in
the circle and select a male to replace her.
Junkanoo music is to The Bahamas what reggae is to Jamaica. In other
words, you can’t miss hearing it. All hotels and resorts, and even some
restaurants, offer this music as part of the evening’s entertainment.
Some musical groups even call themselves “Junkanoo.” Hearing it per-
formed by locals in resorts or hotels is a lot safer than wandering the
back streets of Nassau at night looking for a local club. The music will
probably be just as authentic at the resort.
You can get a taste of Junkanoo at Café Johnny Canoe on Cable Beach,
where the weekly Friday-night parade turns this New Providence restau-
rant into a party (Chapter 12). If you want a close-up look at the elaborate
costumes, stop by the Junkanoo Expo at Prince George Dock in Nassau
(see Chapter 13).
Background Check: Recommended Books 
The checkered past of the archipelago — from pirates to shipwreckers
and rumrunners — comes alive again in Paul Albury’s The Story of The
Bahamas (Macmillan Caribbean). This 294-page book is the best of its
kind for a quick overview. Author Robert H. Fuson dug into the archives
and came up with The Log of Christopher Columbus (International Marine
Publishing), dating from 1492, of course. On seeing The Bahamas for the
first time, the explorer wrote: “I made sail and saw so many islands that I
could not decide where to go first.”
For a lighter read, try Ernest Hemingway’s Islands in the Stream (Charles
Scribner & Sons), the classic novel in which “Papa” created the fascinat-
ing fictional character of Thomas Hudson, tracing his life from his years
as a painter in Bimini in the 1930s through his anti-submarine activities
off the Cuban coast during World War II. The character of Hudson is
much like Hemingway himself.
Isles of Eden: Life in the Southern Family Islands of The Bahamas by
Harvey Lloyd, with a foreword by former Prime Minister Lynden Pindling
(Benjamin), chronicles the island people who live in this rarely visited
archipelago, which stretches 144km (90 miles) southeast of Nassau all
the way to Haiti. Lloyd blends unusual island photographs with social
commentary, history, and personal recollections.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into The Bahamas 31

If you go to The Bahamas for a close encounter with nature, The
Ephemeral Islands: A Natural History of The Bahamas by David G.
Campbell (Media Publishing Ltd.) is the best fauna-and-flora book you
can find. A well-written survey of the natural history of the island also
comes with beautifully illustrated color plates.
The Yachtsman’s Guide to The Bahamas (Tropic Isle Publishers, revised
annually) is an essential guide for all visitors considering boat tours of
The Bahamas. This guide is the standard one used by most yachties,
but Stephen Pavlidis is cutting in on the market with The Abaco Guide:
A Cruising Guide to the Northern Bahamas including Grand Bahama, the
Bight of Abaco, and the Abacos (Seaworthy Publications). Pavlidas is a
veteran of these seas, and his charts are the most accurate ones pub-
lished. Because he’s an active ham-radio operator, yachties in the
Abacos often talk to him.

Beach reads
Before heading for the sands, pick up a copy of Desmond Bagley’s Bahama Crisis
(Fontana/Collin). This mystery spins around the character of Tom Mangan, who lures
rich guests to his hotel in The Bahamas, where disaster strikes in a series of strange
accidents.
Barry Estabrook’s Bahama Heat (St. Martin’s Press) is whimsical and a good read,
dealing with the usual drug-running schemes in The Bahamas, but with more plot than
most. The cast of characters ranges from a rum-guzzling, charismatic pastor to a
crazed lesbian pilot.
Great descriptions of The Bahamas, especially underwater, appear in the fast-paced
Bahamas Blue, by D. C. Poyer (St. Martin’s Press). Poyer is a well-known writer of sea
adventures, and in this action-packed thriller he demonstrates both his love of the sea
and his contempt for the drug runners who abuse it.
One of the most evocative novels on The Bahamas is Paradise Overdose: A Novel by
Brian Antoni (Grove Press). Drug trafficking once again figures into this tale of a young
bachelor, Chris Angostura, whose life centers around women and cocaine. The trop-
ical paradise comes alive in the descriptions of beaches and turquoise seas, but the
profanity isn’t for the faint of heart.

W
hen measured against any region of the Caribbean, the Bahamian
archipelago — which lies entirely in the Atlantic Ocean — is the
number-one destination for visitors.
In this chapter, we help you decide which island is best for you by giving
you a rundown of the highlights and drawbacks of each of the most 
popular (and most accessible) islands. If you want casinos and mega-
resorts, for example, you may want to head for Paradise Beach, the most
expensive area in The Bahamas. But if you seek a remote, tranquil loca-
tion with pink sandy beaches and quiet inns, then Harbour Island may
be for you, although it’s also expensive. A fun quiz at the end of this
chapter helps you narrow down your island options.
For details on where to stay, where to dine, and where to play on each of
the islands covered in this book, check out Parts III through VI.
Introducing The Bahamas
Many people think that The Bahamas are in the Caribbean Sea when,
in fact, they’re surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean. But culturally, The
Bahamas are part of the Caribbean.
The Bahamas are an archipelago of some 700 islands (many mere islets)
and 2,500 coral reefs. These reefs extend for about 1,290km (800 miles)
on a northwest/southeast slant. The archipelago lies between the
Atlantic Ocean and the Straits of Florida, with channels separating
The Bahamas from Cuba and the island of Hispaniola (jointly owned
by the Dominican Republic and Haiti). Only about 20 of the islands are
inhabited.

George Washington called The Bahamas the “isles of perpetual June.”
They have a warmer climate than their northern latitude would suggest
because equatorial sea currents bathe them. And the refreshing trade
winds blowing in from the Atlantic rescue them from torrid summer 
seasons — the effect is kind of like natural air-conditioning.
The northern locale of these islands means that during winter months,
the weather is sometimes cooler than it is in the always-warm Caribbean.
(For more details about the best times to travel, turn to Chapter 4.)
Without question, most of these islands have beautiful beaches, superb
snorkeling, great scuba diving, and big-time boating and fishing. Each
island also boasts its own special character and atmosphere. This variety
means that you can easily tailor a trip to almost any desire or budget.
Finding the Right Island for You
The most frequently visited island in The Bahamas is New Providence,
which includes the resort areas of Nassau and Cable Beach on its north-
ern shore, and the offshore Paradise Island. New Providence is a world
of gambling casinos, cruise-ship arrivals, mega-resorts, Las Vegas–like
entertainment, and fancy restaurants.
The area’s cousin, which offers the same diversions but without so
much glitter, is the second-most visited island: Grand Bahama, with
its vacation “villages” of Freeport and Lucaya.
Don’t be misled by all the hype in Nassau and Freeport about shopping
bargains. You do save on tax, but prices on many international goods are
list, so you often pay what you would back home.
New Providence and Grand Bahama are where most of the dry-land
sightseeing is concentrated, from forts and museums to aquariums, 
gardens, and nature reserves. A couple of straw markets plus scores of
stores and boutiques are additional attractions. New Providence and
Grand Bahama are also the most accessible islands from the United
States because of frequent flights and ship or ferry connections.
If the thought of taking an elevator to the beach leaves you cold, you
may want to pass on the high-rises and impersonal crowds of Nassau,
Paradise Island, and Freeport/Lucaya and head to the Out Islands
instead.
The Out Islands are the most beautiful part of The Bahamas. Miles of
empty, golden sand beaches trim the clear waters. Except for scattered
small towns — villages, really — and only a few large-scale beach
resorts, nature has been left almost intact. Chickens, donkeys, sheep,
and goats wander freely through front yards and on roads. Boats, bicy-
cles, golf carts, and feet are more prevalent than cars on some islands.
Part I: Introducing The Bahamas 
34

The most visited of the Out Islands include, in order, the Abacos (with
Marsh Harbour, on Great Abaco, as its capital), Eleuthera (with its major
vacation spot of Harbour Island), and the Exumas (popular with the
boating crowd). Less visited and more alluring to those visitors who
seek offbeat locations is San Salvador, which is home to a Club Med, the
only major resort in the southern Bahamas.
The Out Islands aren’t as easy to get to as Nassau, Paradise Island, or
Freeport/Lucaya. In some cases, you have to take a plane (or two), a taxi
to a dock, a ferry, and then another taxi to your hotel. But the inconven-
ience of transportation is a small price to pay for the peacefulness of a
more secluded part of The Bahamas.
Knowing New Providence
A trio of destinations — Nassau, Cable Beach, and Paradise Island —
are The Bahamas’ main vacation areas, outranking its nearest rival,
Freeport/Lucaya, in charm, class, and grandeur. Nassau, Cable Beach,
and Paradise Island are adjoined, so you can stay in one and play in all
three.
An architectural delight of old-world charm, Nassau is also The Bahamas’
largest cruise-ship port. When ships are in port, the center of the city is
congested, with shops, restaurants, and other businesses overflowing.
New Providence is a mix of the ultra-modern and colonial quaint.
The majority of The Bahamas’ roughly 260,000 residents live on New
Providence. Nassau, the archipelago’s colonial capital, consists of a his-
toric center that stretches for about a dozen blocks and is four blocks
wide. Many government buildings have a rather grand neocolonial style
of architecture, and even smaller buildings boast wide balconies, lou-
vered windows, and wood construction. Aging forts, small museums,
gardens, and a zoo can amuse you when you’re not bouncing along the
waves on Jet Skis or off snorkeling or scuba diving.
The part of the city that attracts most visitors lies along the waterfront
and Bay Street, the main street of Nassau, which is a block away from
the water. As you proceed inland from Nassau, the buildings become
less grand, and the incomes of the families dwindle. Families on the
lower end of the economic ladder live on the fringes of Nassau.
Emerging in recent years is New Providence’s answer to Miami Beach:
Cable Beach. Reached by heading west from Nassau along West Bay
Street, Cable Beach opens onto a broad strand of golden sands lined
with mega-resorts. Plenty of casino action and a wide array of water-
sports facilities are available for fun on the beach.
Cable Beach’s major competition is the even glitzier Paradise Beach,
which lies on Paradise Island, reached by a bridge. Although technically
part of New Providence, Paradise Beach is a world unto itself. This
beach has come a long way since it was called Hog Island.
Chapter 3: Choosing Where to Go 35

Paradise Beach boasts the priciest real estate in The Bahamas. Its old-
world charm is long gone, and today it’s home to a colony of high-rises,
condos, second homes of the wintering wealthy, and gambling casinos.
Its centerpiece is the mammoth Atlantis Paradise Island Resort & Casino
(see Chapter 11).
Whether you’re looking for an old-fashioned guesthouse or a splashy
multi-story beach resort, you can find it in New Providence. Restaurants
and fast-food eateries cater to a range of tastes, from the burger-on-
the-run crowd to romantic couples enjoying Continental cuisine by 
candlelight overlooking a lagoon.
Sports lovers can find plenty of golf, tennis, and horseback riding to
keep them busy. Only a few nightclubs in Nassau itself are special. But
after dark, Cable Beach and Paradise Island light up with elegant bars,
dance floors, casinos, and Las Vegas–style stage shows.
Drawing everyone from American college students on spring break to
middle-aged gamblers, many hotels offer economical air/land package
deals. Nassau has a very limited number of hotels and not much in the
way of a beach. Most resorts are clustered along Cable Beach and on
Paradise Island. If you’re looking for a moderately priced place to stay,
find it on Cable Beach — not on Paradise Island.
Bottom line: New Providence isn’t the place for a cozy retreat. But if you
want plenty of diversions and you don’t mind crowds, it sizzles more
than anywhere else in The Bahamas. (For more information on New
Providence, see Part III.)
New Providence delivers a punch because it offers
 Plenty of sights: Nassau lures travelers with old forts, impressive
colonial buildings, small museums, manicured gardens, and a
small zoo.
 A variety of vacation playgrounds: Choose among action-packed
Cable Beach, historic downtown Nassau, and glitzy Paradise Island.
 Shops galore: Here you find The Bahamas’ largest selection of duty-
free stores and designer boutiques, plus the largest straw market.
But New Providence is far from being paradise. Here’s a look at the
downsides:
 No warm and cuddly hotel service: With thousands of visitors
arriving in Nassau every day, staffs at restaurants and hotels have
grown jaded by tourism. You won’t get the kind of service you may
get at an Out Island inn, where all the staff knows you by name.
 Crowds and congestion: If you live in a metropolis and want to
escape crowds on your vacation, Nassau isn’t for you. When cruise
ships pull in at the same time, passengers overrun shops at the

Straw Market and in the center of town. Visitors also crowd the golf
courses, beaches, and popular restaurants.
 A walk on the wild side: You can find safer places to be at night
than downtown Nassau. It has the highest crime rate in all The
Bahamas. Our advice is to take a taxi to where you’re going after
dark in the center of Nassau.
Getting to know Grand Bahama
After New Providence, the second-most popular attraction in The
Bahamas is the large island of Grand Bahama, which contains Freeport,
the second-largest city in The Bahamas. When compared to Nassau,
Freeport is rather unsophisticated. But its beaches at Lucaya are top-
notch, as are its duty-free shopping, glittering casinos, and two national
parks. When you want to capture some of the spirit of The Bahamas of
yesterday, you can escape from all this modernity by heading to the
funky little village of West End.
Grand Bahama has a much younger and trimmer look than Nassau.
Stately palms and pines border broad, landscaped boulevards. Modern
high-rise hotels, apartment buildings, and condominiums overlook
beaches and marinas. Smooth lawns sprouting flowering shrubs sur-
round stucco homes topped with terra-cotta tiles. The flip side of this
beauty is that Grand Bahama doesn’t offer much history. Too much of its
architecture is either kitschy or bland, with little local flavor.
The hotels in Grand Bahama endured a slump at the end of the 20th cen-
tury, but many of them are bouncing back after being vastly restored or
completely rebuilt. Even better news is that hotel rates on the island
tend to be moderate — none of the lodgings carry the high price tags
that shock you on New Providence.
Likewise, Grand Bahama has many good restaurants but not world-class
ones like those in New Providence. You can still eat well, especially if
you follow our recommendations. As for nightlife, Grand Bahama has
some, but no one ever mistakes it for Las Vegas.
Duty-free shopping remains one of the major attractions of Grand
Bahama, especially at the emerging Port Lucaya Marketplace and also
at the famous but rather tacky International Bazaar at Freeport.
Grand Bahama is perfect for the active vacationer. Topping most lists is
excellent scuba diving, snorkeling trips by kayak to offshore islets, the
chance to pet Flipper’s cousins in the Dolphin Experience (see Chapter
17), the island’s landscaped gardens and nature reserves, deep-sea fish-
ing and, of course, the golden sand beaches.
Bottom line: Grand Bahama is short on island spice but compensates
with its diversity of activities, ranging from gambling to watersports.

Grand Bahama Island
Chapter 3: Choosing Where to Go 39

Grand Bahama is a hit with travelers because
 Young destination: Developed during the 1960s, the ox-jaw shaped
island has been called a “mecca for fast-lane vacationers.”
 International appeal: Many Americans, Canadians, and Europeans
live and work here alongside Bahamians.
 Fewer hotels: The main beach resort area, Lucaya, isn’t nearly as
crowded with hotels as New Providence’s Cable Beach or Paradise
Island.
But Grand Bahama has its downsides:
 Little history: Unlike Nassau with its buccaneering past, the his-
tory of Grand Bahama is rather colorless, except when the
Confederate States used it as a supply depot.
 Less local appeal: The cultural scene here is much blander than in
Nassau or the Out Islands, where you can find lots of local flavor
and island spice.
 A jumping-off point for day-trippers: Unlike New Providence and
the Out Islands, Grand Bahama attracts a lot of day-trippers who
are on cheap cruises from Florida.
 Not many beach hotels: Not all the best hotels are on the golden
sands.
Arriving in the Abacos
Spanning 1,683 sq. km (650 sq. miles), the Abaco Islands form the
second-largest landmass in this island nation. The boomerang-shaped
chain is at the northernmost tier of The Bahamas, stretching 321km
(200 miles) from Walker’s Cay in the northwest to Cherokee Sound in
the southeast.
A true water world, the Abacos make a prime destination for sailing,
scuba diving, snorkeling, fishing, and island hopping. Green Turtle Cay
boasts one of the fanciest hotels in the Out Islands but, for the most
part, lodgings in the Abacos are laid-back. Travelers arriving in
September and October will find many hotels and restaurants closed
because of the lack of business.
Unlike the relatively flat and charmless island of Grand Bahama,
the Abacos are among the most beautiful islands in the nation. 
The man-made attractions are appealing as well. One of The Bahamas’
best golf courses is in the Out Islands at Treasure Cay. And, if you’re
into history and colonial architecture, you can enjoy the tidy New
England-style seaside villages on Elbow Cay, Green Turtle Cay, and 
Man-O-War Cay.

The Abaco Islands
Chapter 3: Choosing Where to Go 41

Here’s a rundown of the Abaco Islands:
 Marsh Harbour: Marsh Harbour is the capital of the Abacos. But
don’t expect congestion, even though it contains the only traffic
light in the Out Islands. A legendary port among boaters, Marsh
Harbour lies on Great Abaco Island and is a shipbuilding center.
The town lacks the New England charm of either New Plymouth or
Hope Town (see Elbow Cay and Green Turtle Cay in this list) and
instead has the feel of a small Florida town.
Everything is relatively new in Marsh Harbour, most of it dating
from the middle of the 1980s. The town’s growth originally was
fueled by drug money; it only recently discovered tourism. To meet
the demands of modern tourism, some excellent restaurants have
opened, as well as hotels, shops, bars, cafes, and boat outfitters.
For more information on Marsh Harbour, see Chapter 18.
 Elbow Cay: All motor vehicles are banned from the center of Hope
Town, the island’s Cape Cod–like village. Along the narrow, paved
streets, you find harborside restaurants and saltbox cottages
painted in tropical tones, with pink and yellow bougainvillea drip-
ping over stone or picket fences. Many Americans, Canadians, and
Europeans, who first arrived as vacationers decades ago, own some
of the biggest and most attractive homes.
People get around this small island by golf cart, bicycle, and foot,
but the boat is the primary means of locomotion. Amid a bobbing
mass of boats, Hope Town’s red-and-white striped lighthouse prob-
ably has had more photographs taken of it than any other sight on
the island. You can hike or bike to isolated Tahiti Beach, where
shelling at low tide is great fun. For more information on Elbow Cay,
see Chapter 19.
 Green Turtle Cay: The 18th-century New England–style village of
New Plymouth is idyllic for strolling. You can find out about the
Abacos’ seafaring past at the Albert Lowe Museum, housed in an
old cottage. Across the street, the Memorial Sculpture Garden
honors noteworthy Bahamians.
Boats take people around Green Turtle Cay more than wheels and
feet do. Coral colonies starting in relatively shallow water make for
some of the best snorkeling in The Bahamas, and diving is excep-
tional. You can spend a day on a deserted beach on an uninhabited
island. You can swim with stingrays, and the captain of your boat
can spear lobster and fish and then grill them for you right on the
beach.
 Its rooms decked with Oriental rugs and Queen Anne chairs, Green
Turtle Club and Marina is among the most upscale places to stay
in the Out Islands. Tiny Green Turtle Cay doesn’t have fairways, but
if you’re a golfer, you can take the ferry and a taxi (or charter a
Part I: Introducing The Bahamas 
42

boat) to the championship golf course at Treasure Cay. For more
information on Green Turtle Cay, see Chapter 20.
 Treasure Cay: A little sterile for our tastes, Treasure Cay feels too
much like a playground designed exclusively for visitors. Not much
of a local settlement was here before this resort developed during
the 1960s, so you won’t find any historic sites or old island commu-
nities. If not for the golden crescent beach and the rich blues of the
water, you may forget that you’re in The Bahamas.
This lack of local color doesn’t seem to bother the vacationers who
come to fish and play golf on one of the country’s best courses.
They stay in the attractive hotels, condos, and villas on the marina
and beach. Treasure Cay is close to the dock where you can catch
the ferry to Green Turtle Cay, and you can easily rent a boat to sail
to Elbow Cay, Man-O-War Cay, and other nearby islands. Rooms
are hard to come by in May during the Treasure Cay Billfish
Championship. For more information on Treasure Cay, turn to
Chapter 21.
Bottom line: Nirvana for divers, snorkelers, and anglers, the Abacos
offer many opportunities to sail off to different islands, each with its own
special allure. Many islands are uninhabited while others have man-made
attractions that run a distant second to natural beauty.
The Abacos are a good choice if you’re hoping for
 An underwater wonderland, fish tales, and great greens: The
Abacos have some of the most alluring scuba diving, snorkeling,
and fishing around and, in Treasure Cay, there’s a championship
golf course.
 Scenic villages: Historic seaside settlements on Elbow Cay, Green
Turtle Cay, and Man-O-War Cay are filled with pretty clapboard cot-
tages surrounded by white-picket fences.
 Spectacular sailing: With so many appealing islands clustered
together, the Abacos are called “the Sailing Capital of the World.”
Locals who love their islands claim that the Abacos are Paradise Found
and that they have no downsides. Even so, you may not like
 The travel time: Getting to these islands can take a while. You may
need a plane, a ferry, and a taxi to reach your destination. 
 Potential seasickness: Almost everybody in the Abacos uses boats
to travel more than they rely on wheels, so if you’re prone to sea-
sickness you may want to choose a different destination.
 Hardly any hotels: You don’t have many choices for lodging, and
most options are small and low-key.
Chapter 3: Choosing Where to Go 43

Hanging out on Harbour Island
Harbour Island is small — barely 5 sq. km (2 sq. miles) — but it’s one of
the most beautiful islands in The Bahamas. Its major attraction is a long,
broad, pink beach, tinted by pulverized coral and shells. The snorkeling
and scuba diving are first-rate. You can even reach shipwrecks on a
scuba outing. Perched on a bluff overlooking the water are several of
the country’s prime — and most expensive — inns and small hotels.
(Many accommodations and restaurants close here during the fall.)
Wander into Dunmore Town, and you stroll past historic churches, 
18th-century cottages with lacy gingerbread trim, and tropical flowers
nuzzling picket fences.
Harbour Island is affectionately known to residents as Briland. Briland
lures mainly American and Canadian vacationers, and more than a few of
them have snapped up prime real estate here. However, the island main-
tains a distinct Bahamian look and feel. At the harbor’s edge, old men
shoot the breeze while slapping dominos onto card tables. Chickens and
horses wander through front yards. Women trade gossip while selling
straw goods and shell jewelry from outdoor stalls. If those wares aren’t
upscale enough for you, go boutique browsing for Haitian paintings,
Balinese silver, and French wine vinegar.
In Harbour Island, you can don your drop-dead duds for candlelit cock-
tails one night and cool out over Kaliks (the local brew) in a smoky pool
hall the next. However, hipbones don’t usually start slipping until the
weekend, when anything from waterside hotel decks to cavelike local
bars morph into dance clubs. Mom-and-pop kitchens whip up Bahamian
favorites, such as cracked conch (pounded, battered, and fried) and
peas and rice. Hotels lure diners with gourmet creations. And don’t be
surprised if your waiter knows you went sailing before you tell him —
folks are friendly, and word travels fast. But don’t worry: With quiet
roads, romantic lookout points, and empty sandy strands, you can find
plenty of places to keep your privacy intact. For more information on
Harbour Island, see Chapter 22.
Bottom line: With some of The Bahamas’ finest small beach hotels, a
time-warp waterfront village, and a pink sand beach, you can’t go wrong
with Harbour Island — if you can afford it.
Harbour Island’s highlights include
 Pink sand: The hue of this stunning 5km (3-mile) beach is rosy, and
it runs the whole length of the eastern side of the island.
 Eye candy: Picture this scene: New England meets the tropics, with
white picket fences around colonial clapboard houses that are
shaded by palm trees.
 Small-town hospitality: Briland is so petite and friendly that residents
may start greeting you by name before you can say “cracked conch.”

Chapter 3: Choosing Where to Go 45
Before you decide on Harbour Island, however, consider the following:
 Cost: Harbour Island is one of the most expensive islands in The
Bahamas.
 Travel fatigue: A trip here from the U.S. requires a plane or two, a
taxi, a ferry, and another taxi.
 Quiet nights: What little nightlife there is wakes up mainly on the
weekends.
Eloping to Eleuthera
Eleuthera is a wisp of an island chain that stretches for a distance of
161km (100 miles) from north to south. It lies only 81km (50 miles) east
of Nassau, but in terms of atmosphere, it’s a thousand miles removed
from that busy scene.

Eleuthera
Part I: Introducing The Bahamas 
46

Even though the atmosphere is relatively quiet, Eleuthera remains one of
the most developed of the Out Islands when stacked against the Exumas
or the southern Bahamas.
However, Eleuthera’s heyday is long gone. The chic social scene is now
but a memory with the closing of such ritzy resorts as the Cotton Club
and the Winderemere Club in South Eleuthera. Today, the rich and
famous head for Harbour Island because the entire mainland of
Eleuthera doesn’t really have a state-of-the-art hotel.
At no point is Eleuthera more than 6km (4 miles) wide. Despite the
island’s size, some 10,000 people eke out a living on Eleuthera, which
hasn’t always been a friendly place to do so. What Eleuthera offers in
great abundance is a galaxy of beaches, an “endless summer,” and multi-
hued seas ranging from deep blue to aquamarine.
On Eleuthera, you don’t have to bother with historical sites or museums
because none exist. What we like to do is drive the Queens Highway
for the whole length of the island. We know of no more dramatic drive
in all The Bahamas. For the most part, you hug the coastline and get
stunning views of the seascape or landscape. The seaside villages you
come across have known better days, but it’s their decaying gingerbread
charm that attracts us in the first place. In Eleuthera, you get the impres-
sion that everyone was once here but now is gone. You can wander
about the most remote places, which you have all to yourself.
For more information on Eleuthera, see Chapter 23.
Bottom line: Come here if you’re the ultimate escapist, seeking unspoiled
beaches, few people, diversions mainly of your own creation, and life in
The Bahamas the way it used to be.
Consider a visit to Eleuthera if you’re hoping for
 Remote seaports and villages from long ago: With its fashionable
heyday long gone, the settlements of Eleuthera exist in a time warp.
Far removed from casino wheels and mega-resorts, the little inns of
Eleuthera take us back to the 1950s.
 Scenery and sights: Why come here? For the miles and miles of
unspoiled beaches, for gingerbread-trimmed houses hung with
bougainvillea, for bargains galore, for rolling hills, for lush green
forests, for sheltered coves, and for offshore coral reefs.
 Friendly people: Instead of being locked away in a high-rise hotel,
you get to meet the locals. The island doesn’t have any big towns —
only small settlements that welcome visitors.
For a look at the downside of Eleuthera, consider
 The absence of any top-rated hotels: If you want luxury, Eleuthera
sends you to Harbour Island. To live on “mainland” Eleuthera,
Chapter 3: Choosing Where to Go 47

you most often settle for “rental units,” which are clean but rather
basic — definitely not luxurious.
 No catering: Visitors find that everything is pretty much of a do-it-
yourself affair on Eleuthera. “Things,” as they’re called here, aren’t
very well organized. A lot of personal initiative is needed to make
your vacation wheels spin.
 Difficult transportation: Except for the main highway, roads are
often a disaster. Because no major car-rental companies exist, you
often have to negotiate with a local for a rental.
Exploring Exuma
Looking out the window of your plane, you can see that the water is 
different colors before you even get to Exuma. Strung out like stepping-
stones, these islands are surrounded by some of The Bahamas’ most
beautiful waters.
With a cay for every day of the year — and most of them uninhabited —
Exuma is prime sailing territory. A bridge joins Great Exuma and Little
Exuma, the two largest islands in the chain. Hotels and island action are
concentrated in and around George Town, Exuma’s pretty capital on
Great Exuma. If you happen to vacation here in April, you can catch the
festivities of the National Family Island Regatta. Far up north — and
accessible only by chartered boat — the gorgeous Exuma Cays Land
and Sea Park covers 160 sq. km (177 sq. miles) of islands and marine
life. See Chapter 24 for more on Exuma’s attractions.
You can make arrangements for sailing, snorkeling, diving, and fishing
through your hotel. Be forewarned, though, that George Town’s few
hotels aren’t located on the best beaches. For the best sandy stretches,
you have to take a ferry to undeveloped Stocking Island, which has a
sole hotel just across the harbor.
Bottom line: Exuma is a fine choice if sailing, R & R, and absorbing 
natural beauty are more important to you than man-made sights and
late-night entertainment.
Exuma has many idyllic qualities, including
 Water colors: Bring your camera, or no one at home will believe
you when you describe the range of aquatic hues.
 Small size: Petite hotels — a couple of hotels are on their own
islands — and friendly residents quickly make you feel at home.
 Parties: Well, sometimes, at least. On most Saturday nights, every-
one heads to Club Peace and Plenty’s dance party, and in April, the
festivities of the National Family Island Regatta bring many a far-
flung Bahamian home to Exuma.

Chapter 3: Choosing Where to Go 49
But Exuma isn’t always convenient because
 The marine park isn’t nearby: You may hear talk of the Exuma
Cays Land and Sea Park, but unless you charter a boat (or both a
boat and a small plane), you can’t get there from George Town,
where most vacationers stay.
 You may have to take a boat to the beach: George Town, where
most hotels reside, isn’t known for its beaches, and not all hotels
are on the sand. Better beaches surround Stocking Island, which is
a short ferry ride across the harbor.
 It can get crowded: During the National Family Island Regatta each
spring, George Town can get as packed as Cable Beach in February.

Savoring San Salvador
Lying 322km (200 miles) southeast of Nassau is the Bahamian island of
San Salvador, which is often confused with the Central American coun-
try of the same name. Some folks say that this scuba-diving mecca is the
first place that Christopher Columbus stepped ashore in the “New” World.
(The world that wasn’t new at all, of course, to the Native Americans
living there for at least five centuries.) Historians bitterly debate whether
the famed explorer ever came here, however, with some experts believ-
ing his first landfall was actually at Samana Cay, another Bahamian
island 105km (65 miles) to the south. But don’t tell that to residents of
San Salvador. They point you with pride to all the island’s monuments
that commemorate the world-changing event.
Columbus’s visit, if it happened at all, didn’t change San Salvador very
much. Most of this island is nearly as undeveloped as it was back in the
days when Lucayan Indians called it home. The interior is still interlaced
with a network of quiet lakes, and the main village, Cockburn Town,
couldn’t be much drowsier. Climb to the top of Dixon Hill Lighthouse,
and you get a sweeping view of the island and its pristine coastline.
Bicycling is another good way to see San Salvador.
Today, many visitors are avid divers who wax poetic about the variety
and bright colors of the coral and other marine life. Visitors don’t fre-
quent the best dive sites as much as the ones around New Providence
because San Salvador has only a couple of hotels. True, one hotel is the
sprawling Club Med, but not all the guests here are interested in scuba.
Although the other hotel, the locally run Riding Rock Inn Resort and
Marina, has long been a favorite among serious divers, it’s not large
enough to cause scuba gridlock at any diving sites.
The island’s two main beach hotels give vacationers a choice: Do you
want a small, unassuming scuba-lover’s hangout that’s dead-quiet during
the day (Riding Rock), or do you want a huge low-rise resort decorated
with an impressive collection of international folk art that’s like a play-
ground for adults (Club Med)? The bar at Riding Rock is the island’s
social center, and it hosts parties once or twice a week where vaca-
tioners hang out with locals. Although something’s happening every
night at Club Med, you can forget that you’re in The Bahamas after dark
because most people here aren’t locals. For more information on San
Salvador, check out Chapter 25.
Bottom line: Since Club Med hit the scene, San Salvador isn’t just for
divers anymore, but the underwater sights are still the main draw
beyond cooling out amid pristine surroundings.
San Salvador may be a good choice if you find the following activities
enticing:

 Serene scuba: More than three dozen unspoiled dive sites are less
than 45 minutes from shore.
 Fabulous digs: A great all-inclusive resort — one of the top of Club
Med’s line — sits along an excellent sandy stretch.
 Striking beaches: Finding shores that are more naturally stunning
is hard to do.
But, consider these downsides:
 Few hotels: Your choice of accommodations is basically between
an upscale Club Med and a modest diving-oriented resort.
 No real towns: Cockburn Town is more like a sleepy residential
neighborhood.
 Little island action: Don’t come here looking for any activities
other than what Club Med offers.

Visiting More than One Island
One island is certainly enough for most visitors, especially if you stay in
Nassau on New Providence or Freeport/Lucaya on Grand Bahama, where
you can find sights and activities to keep you busy beyond the waves.
If you need variety to spice up your life, consider an island that makes a
good home base for exploring other landfalls by boat, such as an island
in the Abacos or the Exumas. From many islands, checking out a second
island (or third or fourth) is as easy as hopping in a water taxi or a ferry,
or taking a snorkeling cruise.
For example, on a visit to New Providence, based at either Cable Beach
or Nassau, all you have to do is cross a bridge to enter another world —
Paradise Island. From New Providence, you can also take boats to offshore
cays. If you have the time, you can plan three nights in cosmopolitan
New Providence and then spend the rest of your vacation week in, say,
Harbour Island near Eleuthera.
Keep in mind that getting from some islands to others can be tricky,
especially when you need to fly. Visiting more than one Out Island by
air usually means that you have to return to Nassau between islands
because most remote islands don’t have air links, except by expensive
charter planes. Therefore, you may spend a lot of time sitting around
Nassau International Airport because some flights are once a day (or
even once every few days) and delays are common. See Chapter 6 for
more information.
Narrowing Your Island Choices
The following quiz helps you determine which islands are best suited to
your vacation style and interests.
Step 1: Get to know your “Rate the Islands”
scorecard.
The scorecard at the end of the quiz has a column for each island and a
row for each of the categories in our island-rating system. Use this score-
card to compile a rating for each island, based on the special-interest
categories that follow.
On a scale of 1 to 4 points, the top vacation destinations are rated in var-
ious categories, such as dining, nightlife, price, sights, diving, and more.
The lowest rating is 1, and the highest is 4. When an island isn’t listed, it
flunked completely. For example, golfers don’t go to Harbour Island
because it has no greens.

52

Step 2: Score islands based on what 
interests you.
Rate islands only in categories of interest to you. For example, if you
don’t play golf, skip that one. Write the scores for each island in the
appropriate row under each column in your scorecard. For example, if
you’re looking for luxury, go across row 1 of your scorecard and put 4
under New Providence, 3 under Harbour Island, 2 under San Salvador,
and 1 under Grand Bahama.
Keep racking up points until you review all the categories and give each
island a score for every category of interest to you.

Deciding When to Go
In This Chapter
 Evaluating the seasons
 Charting the weather
 Planning your trip around special events
T
he Bahamas have their high season in winter and their low season in
summer, but any time of the year can be a good time for a visit —
that is, if the weather holds. The off season can bring hurricanes, but
you receive plenty of warnings before these storms arrive.
This chapter highlights not only the weather but also the best year-
round happenings, from Junkanoo parades to sailing regattas.
Revealing the Secrets of the Seasons
Bahamian weather falls into two main seasons: winter (high season) and
summer (low season). The Bahamas are in the Atlantic Ocean, just north
of the warmer Caribbean region. For this reason, high season can mean
surprisingly cool weather, especially in the northern Bahamas. But cool
spells, if they descend at all, blow away rather quickly, and you’re back
on the beach after a day or two. The southern Bahamian islands, on the
other hand, truly live up to their reputation of being “June all year round.”
Visiting during high season
High season is roughly November through April, which is the cooler,
drier, and more expensive time of year to visit. Although average tem-
peratures in The Bahamas may vary only about 12°F throughout the
year, winter temperatures can sink into the 60s (about 18°C). Especially
during winter months, early morning and evening temperatures are
often cool enough to require sweaters or jackets, even when you wear
beach gear during the day. See Tables 4-1 and 4-2 for more info on the
weather.
If you’re not willing to risk a few days that are better suited to golf and
tennis than to sand and surf, you may not want to book your vacation
during January or February.

Spring break occurs during the high season (from late Feb to mid-Apr).
This time of year is when many hotels, restaurants, and beaches are
packed with vacationing American college students who have clearly
checked their inhibitions at the airport. If you’re not looking to party,
you may want to avoid the area. But if you’re here during these festive
weeks, you can treat yourself to an extra dose of entertainment, includ-
ing sporting events, beach parties, and musical performances.

In-season advantages
If you live in the northern climates that are swept with wintry blizzards,
nothing is more appealing than a white sandy beach under a summer-
like sun on a palm tree-studded Bahamian island in February. The best
reasons to visit during the high season are
 The winter weather in The Bahamas has been called “a perpetual
June.” The daytime temperature usually doesn’t dip below 70°F
(21°C).
 All restaurants, services, sports activities, entertainment, shops,
and facilities operate at full blast from mid-December to mid-April.
 The in-season is ideal for singles and honeymooners because 
families with children are gone and a more romantic atmosphere
prevails.
 Both the rainy season and the hurricane season are over. Except
for a rare cloudy day, you mostly have sand, sea, and sunshine.
Some visitors add an extra “s” to that allure — sex.
Part I: Introducing The Bahamas 
62

 The cuisine at resorts is better than ever. The resorts bring in top
chefs from both Europe and America during the winter months to
tease your taste buds.
In-season disadvantages
Of course, the greatest allure is enjoying sun and sand when much of the
United States and Canada is in a deep freeze. But here are the downsides:
 You find lots of people crowding around you in airport lounges, on
the most popular beaches, at the resorts’ buffet tables, at the best
restaurants (the lucky stiffs reserved the best tables before you
called), and in the casinos.
 Reservations become extremely important at resorts, car-rental
agencies, nightclubs, the best restaurants, and even for sports
activities, such as scuba-diving courses.
 You pay top dollar for everything from your hotel room to your car
rental. Hotel rates skyrocket, especially around the Christmas holi-
days. Nothing, including the merchandise in shops, is discounted in
winter.
 Expect a more frantic pace at the resorts when the guest count
reaches maximum capacity. Personalized service goes the way of
the trade winds.
Checking out the islands during low season
Low season — May to October — is warmer and wetter and, therefore, is
a less expensive time to travel to The Bahamas. Most rain falls between
June and October. Showers are usually brief, often coming in the late
afternoon, and sometimes the sun doesn’t even bother to stop shining
during downpours.
As pleasant as you may find the balmy subtropical summer, the low
season is also hurricane season. Officially, hurricane season lasts from
June to November, but these storms are most likely to arrive during late
August, September, or October. Although summer or fall travel can save
you a few bucks, it can also cancel your trip. You can, of course, insure
yourself in case you’re forced to cancel your Bahamian vacation because
of a hurricane (see Chapter 9).
The good news is that hurricanes aren’t all that common in The Bahamas.
Even if one is predicted to hit during your vacation, you usually have
enough warning (with the help of satellite forecasts) to rearrange your
plans. If you choose to travel during this time of year, you can keep an
eye on weather patterns by visiting the National Weather Service Web
site at www.nws.noaa.gov.
Chapter 4: Deciding When to Go 63

Off-season advantages
Although The Bahamas may seem more inviting during the winter, here
are the many reasons that your trip may be much more enjoyable if you
go during the off season:
 A less-hurried way of life prevails. You have a better chance to
savor the food, culture, and customs.
 Swimming pools and beaches are less crowded.
 Resorts offer year-round activities, like snorkeling, boating, and
scuba diving, often at reduced rates.
 Resort boutiques often feature summer sales.
 You frequently can get a table at a top restaurant without a 
reservation.
 You don’t have to wait for a rental car, tee time, or an open tennis
court.
 Some package-tour prices are as much as 20 percent lower, and indi-
vidual excursion fares are also reduced between 5 and 10 percent.
 You may have an easier time booking accommodations and flights.
 The very best of attractions — sea, sand, and surf, and plenty of
sunshine — remain undiminished in the off season.
Off-season disadvantages
Although the advantages of off-season travel outweigh the disadvan-
tages, here are some drawbacks to summer travel:
 You may end up staying at a construction site: Caribbean hoteliers
save their serious repairs and major renovations until the off season.
 Hotels often reduce their services and staff.
 Not all resort restaurants and bars are fully operational.
Perusing a Calendar of Events
The following are special events that you may want to keep in mind
when you plan your vacation.
Bahamians celebrate familiar holidays, such as New Year’s Day, Good
Friday, Easter, and Christmas, but you should also prepare for closed
businesses, shorter hours, or wild partying on Easter Monday,
Whitmonday (seven weeks after Easter), Labour Day (the first Fri in
June), Independence Day (July 10), Emancipation Day (the first Mon
in Aug), Discovery Day (Oct 12), and Boxing Day (Dec 26).

(1⁄4-mile) swim, a 5.5km (31⁄2-mile) run, and a 6.5km (4-mile) bike ride. This
festival occurs in early June. For more information, call % 242-332-2142.
July
Independence Week: Festivities, parades, and fireworks mark
Independence Week throughout the islands. The celebrations culminate
on Independence Day, which is July 10.
Annual Racing Time in Abaco: This event is an eight-day series of five

Chapter 5
Managing Your Money
In This Chapter
 Figuring out your budget
 Saving money without skimping on fun
 Choosing between paper and plastic
 Knowing what to do when you lose your wallet
A
fabulous vacation in The Bahamas doesn’t have to put you in the
poor house. Taking a few moments to figure out your expenses in
advance, deciding how to carry your money, and finding out what to do
if your wallet is lost or stolen can ensure a trouble-free vacation without
a financial hangover.
Planning Your Budget
To get an idea of your expenses, try taking a mental stroll through your
entire trip. Start with the cost of transportation from your home to the
airport, your airline tickets, and transfers to your accommodations.
Add your daily hotel rate, meals, activities and entertainment, and your
return to the airport. Then add in your transportation home from the
airport. And finally, just to be on the safe side, add another 15 to 20 per-
cent for other costs that may crop up. Table 5-1, “What Things Cost in
The Bahamas,” contains a few representative examples of prices on
transportation, dining, and entertainment options.
The lowest airfares and the cheapest resort rates are in effect from April
15 to December 15. If you must go during the Christmas and New Year’s
holidays, expect the steepest airfares and hotel rates. Resort prices tend
to fall right after New Year’s and then pick up again in February.
In general, you pay more for your hotel room than your other expenses.
Unless you’re at an all-inclusive hotel, you can escape your resort’s usu-
ally expensive dining tabs by sneaking away to a little Bahamian kitchen
where you can dine reasonably well on authentic island fare.
Special deals come and go in The Bahamas, even in the peak winter
season. Always check for last-minute deals; otherwise, you may end up
staying in a $275 double room on Paradise Island next door to a couple
who got a room with an even better view for less than $190.

Lodging
The biggest chunk of your budget goes to your accommodations. As you
flip through the island chapters, dollar signs ($ to $$$$$) indicate the
price category of each hotel. For an explanation of these price cate-
gories, turn to the Introduction at the beginning of this book. Notice that
hotel rates are all over the map and may include more than just your
room. Some rates cover breakfast or breakfast and dinner. Also, some
rates include taxes and gratuities but others don’t. The highest-priced
properties we list are all-inclusive resorts, which means that you can’t
compare their rates to the ones of other hotels without taking into
account that one price includes all meals, beverages, and most activities.
The prices of rooms within a single resort can vary as much as the
prices of hotels. Should you shell out top dollar to stay in an oceanfront
suite? Your answer depends on your budget and desire to fall asleep to
the sound of the surf or wake up to the sun shimmering on the water.
But if you find a garden room steps away from the shore just as attrac-
tive and comfortable, you can save the extra cash for something else.
The least you can expect to pay for a double room is about $85 (in the
low season) or $150 (in high season) per night at a small hotel — that is,
on a rack rate, or the top price a hotel charges for a room. See Chapter 7
for a discussion of rack rates and how to avoid paying them.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to The Bahamas

Transportation
Because The Bahamas lie right off the coast of Florida, getting here for
a beach holiday is most often cheaper than flying farther south to the
Caribbean. For specifics on saving money on flights, see Chapter 6.
After you pay for airfare, your transportation costs should be low. Taxis,
hotel shuttles, and public buses are readily available on some islands.
Many vacationers don’t rent cars for good reason: Gas is extremely
expensive in The Bahamas.
Most package deals include transfers between the airport and your
hotel. Ferries to Harbour Island, Green Turtle Cay, Elbow Cay, and 
Man-O-War Cay run $8 to $16 round-trip.
On New Providence (Nassau, Cable Beach, and Paradise Island), you can
get to most sights and attractions on foot or by public bus. Cab fares to
and from sights can add up fast, but you can always take a taxi tour of
several attractions. Half-day taxi tours begin at about $40 for adults.
Most taxi expenses are for transportation to and from restaurants.
Take advantage of the free shuttle buses offered by some resorts. You
can find such shuttles on Paradise Island and Cable Beach on New
Providence as well as in George Town, Exuma.
Dining
In each island chapter in Parts III through VI, we recommend our favorite
restaurants. Dollar signs ($ to $$$$$) indicate whether the restaurant is
cheap, expensive, or somewhere in between (see the Introduction for an
explanation of these price categories).
The prices we quote are for main courses at dinner, unless we state 
otherwise. When a restaurant has $$, for example, these signs mean 
that most of the dinner courses are in that price range, but some may be
more or less expensive. To get a picture of your total expenses, remem-
ber to estimate your beverage, appetizer, dessert, and tip as well.
À la carte hotel breakfast buffets can be expensive, but they’re often
elaborate. With everything from made-to-order omelets and waffles to
carved meats, an array of fresh fruit, and a variety of bread and cereals,
you often don’t need to eat again until dinner.
On the larger islands (New Providence or Grand Bahama), you can
sample some top-rate cuisine. But dinner for two at a top-drawer restau-
rant can easily run more than $100 — before the tip. Costs for these
meals are high because much of the food is imported. Quite a few chefs
are from Europe, however, so you’re treated to the imaginative creations
of some of the Continent’s best. Some of the best food comes from the
marriage of European and island cuisine.
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 73

Check out local restaurants outside the hotels and away from resort
areas. Not only do you come across savory home-style food, but you
also save money. Many of these local establishments aren’t much on
décor, and you may sit in metal chairs and dine on plastic tablecloths,
but the atmosphere is friendly and the price is usually right.
Staying in a rental unit with a kitchen or kitchenette can help you cut
costs. Even if you don’t feel like cooking every meal, you can save plenty
of money by not eating out for every breakfast or lunch. Likewise, if your
room has only a refrigerator, fill it with drinks, snacks, and fruit from the
local grocery store.
Sightseeing and outdoor fun
Of course, the two main activities in The Bahamas — swimming in that
beautiful, impossibly blue sea and basking on those sandy beaches — are
absolutely free. However, if you’re interested in activities like sightseeing
attractions, scuba diving, snorkeling, windsurfing, and water-skiing, they
usually cost extra.
In recent years, more and more of the all-inclusives are offering terrific
freebies like scuba and windsurfing lessons, free water-skiing, and free
snorkeling gear for the week. Some all-inclusive resorts even toss in a
free round of golf.
The costs for activities and attractions can differ greatly from resort to
resort and from island to island. The following are some popular activi-
ties and what you can expect to pay for them:
 Golfing on the go: Greens fees run $85 to $145 at most courses for
18 holes, including a shared cart, plus about $25 to $35 for club
rentals. If that price range isn’t expensive enough for you, try the
course at the Ocean Club on Paradise Island, where greens fees run
around $245. Some courses offer reduced fees for 9 holes in the after-
noon, and rates for both 9 and 18 holes drop during the off season
(roughly May–Oct). Arrange tee times as far in advance as you can.
 Indulging in watersports: Even at all-inclusive resorts, you have to
pay extra for scuba diving, which starts at $88 for a two-tank dive.
To sail off to a reef for snorkeling, expect to spend at least $30. If you
want to rent snorkel gear at the beach, you pay about $15. For deep-
sea fishing, expect to spend at least $75 per person. For details on
boat rentals, windsurfing, water-skiing, and golf (on New Providence,
Grand Bahama, and the Abacos), turn to the island-specific chapters.
 Taking a tour: Save a day to take an island tour, especially if you
aren’t renting a car. Even though taking an island tour may seem
very touristy, it’s cheaper and more convenient to take an organ-
ized tour than to take taxis, especially on Grand Bahama, where the
major attractions are spread out across the island. Island tours
begin at $40. See the individual island chapters in Parts III through
VI for information on destination-specific tours.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to The Bahamas 
74

Shopping
In 1992, the government abolished all import duties on a variety of
items, making for duty-free shopping. You save tax on perfumes, crystal,
leather goods, watches and clocks, jewelry, fine linens and tablecloths,
china, camera equipment, and binoculars and telescopes. If you’re in the
market for any of these goods, you can pay anywhere from 25 to 50 per-
cent less in The Bahamas than in the U.S. You can also take home up to
two liters of liquor duty-free, as long as you’re of legal drinking age in
your country of citizenship.
Save your most serious purchases for Nassau and Freeport/Lucaya,
which have the most variety of merchandise and the best discounts.
Stores on Cable Beach and Paradise Island charge more for their mer-
chandise because of higher rents, and shops in the Out Islands can’t
afford to be as generous in their discounting.
Nightlife
The center of Nassau is rather dead and dull at night, although Cable
Beach and Paradise Island are jumping, as is the Freeport/Lucaya area.
In the Out Islands, a drink in a pub or bar suffices for entertainment.
Because The Bahamas don’t have much spectacular nightlife, you’re not
likely to spend a great deal on it — and, in fact, you can bring your
budget under control by not doing so. That is, unless you gamble.
Then the sky’s the limit.
In general, cover charges for clubs range from $10 to $25. You can find a
lot of cheap entertainment because the lounges of the big resorts often
have live Bahamian bands entertaining you after dark. The price of
admission is the price of a drink.
Taxes
On your hotel bill, you pay resort taxes, gratuities, and sometimes an
energy surcharge. Some hotels include these extras in the quoted rates,
while others add them on to your bill. Make sure that you’re aware of
any extra charges that you pay, because they can easily inflate your
hotel bill by $20, $30, or even $60 or more per night, depending on the
cost of your room.
Total charges vary from hotel to hotel, but you can roughly expect to
pay a 12 percent resort tax and about $8 per day per guest (over age 12)
for housekeeping gratuity and energy surcharges for use of electricity.
Don’t gamble away your last few dollars in cash because you need extra
cash to leave the country. The airports collect a departure tax from
all passengers over age 12. You pay $15 if you’re leaving from New
Providence (Nassau) or Out Islands and $18 from Grand Bahama.
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 75

Cutting Costs — But Not the Fun
You can save money without shortchanging yourself of a good time.
Here are a few ways:
 Go during the off season. If you can travel at non-peak times
(from mid-Apr to mid-Dec, for example), you find hotel prices
are almost half the price they are during peak months.
 Look for a package deal. For many destinations, you can book air-
fare, hotel accommodations, ground transportation, and even some
sightseeing just by making one call to a travel agent or packager,
for a price much less than if you put the trip together yourself.
(Chapter 6 is your source for more on package deals.)
 Reserve a room with a refrigerator and coffeemaker. You don’t
have to slave over a hot stove to cut a few costs; several hotels
have minifridges and coffeemakers. Buying supplies for breakfast
saves you money — and probably calories, too.
 Always ask for discount rates. Membership in AAA, frequent-flier
plans, trade unions, professional organizations, AARP, or other
groups may qualify you for savings on car rentals, plane tickets,
hotel rooms, and even meals. Ask about everything; you may be
pleasantly surprised.
 Get a room off the beach. Accommodations within walking dis-
tance of the shore can be much cheaper than accommodations
right on the beach. Beaches are public, so you don’t need to stay
in a hotel that’s on the sand to spend most of your vacation at the
beach.
 Ask if your kids can stay in the room with you. A room with two
double beds usually doesn’t cost any more than a room with a
queen-size bed. And many hotels don’t charge you the additional-
person rate if the additional person is pint-size and related to you.
Even if you have to pay $10 or $15 extra for a rollaway bed, you can
save hundreds by not taking two rooms.
 Use a pay phone to call home. Avoid using the phone in your hotel
room to call outside the hotel. Charges can be astronomical, even
for local calls, which are sometimes at least $1 a pop (instead of
25¢ at a pay phone). When you call long distance, you may think
that you’re saving money by using the toll-free number of your call-
ing card instead of dialing direct. However, most hotels charge you
at least $1 to connect you to an outside line for the toll-free call.
On top of whatever your calling card bills you, the hotel also
charges you just for picking up the phone — whether or not you
reach the person you wanted.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to The Bahamas 
76

 Try expensive restaurants at lunch instead of dinner. Lunch tabs
are usually a fraction of what dinner costs at a top restaurant, and
the menu often boasts many of the same specialties.
 Walk a lot. A good pair of walking shoes can save you lots of money
on taxis and other local transportation. As a bonus, you get to know
your destination more intimately, as you explore at a slower pace.
 Steer clear of the casinos. If you can’t resist gambling, head to an
island without casinos. Only New Providence and Grand Bahama
offer casinos.
Handling Money
In The Bahamas, you can use U.S. dollars interchangeably with the local
Bahamian dollar — they have the same value. So you don’t have to
worry about exchanging your U.S. cash. If you’re carrying a currency
other than greenbacks, check out the “Converting currency” section
later in this chapter.
As you near the end of your trip, ask for your change in only American
dollars if you’re headed back to the States. Otherwise, you can end up
with unwanted Bahamian currency that you need either to spend or
exchange at the airport, and, if you exchange it there, you lose some of it
to service charges.
Carrying cash, traveler’s checks, or credit cards?
You’re the best judge of how much cash you feel comfortable carrying
or what alternative form of currency is your favorite. Credit and debit
cards, traveler’s checks, and cash are all welcome in The Bahamas, but
some forms of payment are more convenient (or cheaper) than others.
Using ATMs
The easiest and best way to get cash away from home is from an ATM
(automated teller machine), sometimes referred to as a “cash machine,”
or “cashpoint.” Nassau and Freeport have handy 24-hour ATMs linked to
an international network that almost always includes your bank at
home. For the most part, the Out Islands lack this convenience. Cirrus
(% 800-424-7787; www.mastercard.com) and PLUS (% 800-843-7587;
www.visa.com) are the two most popular networks. Check the back of
your ATM card to see which network your bank belongs to. The net-
works’ toll-free numbers and Web sites give specific locations of ATMs
where you can withdraw money while on vacation. You can use them to
withdraw just the amount that you need every couple of days, which
eliminates having to carry around a large green stash.
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 77

Of course, many ATMs are little money managers (or dictators, depend-
ing on how you look at it) that may allow you to withdraw only a certain
amount of money — a maximum of $200, say — per day. Check with your
bank about withdrawal limits before you set off on your vacation.
Another important reminder before you go ATM crazy: Many banks now
charge a fee ranging from 50¢ to $3 whenever a nonaccount holder uses
his ATMs. Your own bank may also assess a fee for using an ATM that
isn’t one of its branch locations. In some cases, you get charged twice
just for using your bank card when you’re on vacation. Reverting to trav-
eler’s checks may be cheaper (although certainly less convenient to get
hold of and use).
The most common bank branches in The Bahamas are offices of First
Caribbean International Bank. All these branches assess small fees for
their transactions.
Toting traveler’s checks
Traveler’s checks are a holdover from the days when people wrote per-
sonal checks instead of going to an ATM. On New Providence (Nassau,
Cable Beach, and Paradise Island) or Grand Bahama (Freeport/Lucaya),
finding a 24-hour ATM is easy, so you don’t need to carry traveler’s
checks or a wad of cash. On smaller islands, such as Eleuthera or the
Abacos, ATMs are few and far between, if not nonexistent, so carrying
traveler’s checks may be a good idea. Be aware, however, that in The
Bahamas, some restaurants tack on an additional service charge when
you pay with a traveler’s check.
You can get traveler’s checks at almost any bank. American Express
offers denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and (for cardholders only)
$1,000. You pay a service charge ranging from 1 percent to 4 percent.
You can also get American Express traveler’s checks over the phone by
calling % 800-221-7282; Amex gold and platinum cardholders who use
this number are exempt from the 1 percent fee. 
Visa offers traveler’s checks at Citibank locations nationwide, as well as
at several other banks. The service charge ranges between 1.5 percent
and 2 percent; checks come in denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500,
and $1,000. Call % 800-732-1322 for information. AAA members can
get hold of Visa checks for a $9.95 fee at most AAA offices or by
calling % 866-339-3378. MasterCard also offers traveler’s checks.
Call % 800-223-9920 for a location near you. 
If you choose to carry traveler’s checks, be sure to keep a record of their
serial numbers separate from your checks in the event that they are
stolen or lost. You get a refund faster if you know the numbers.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to The Bahamas 
78

Charging ahead with credit cards
Credit cards are a safe way to carry money: They also provide a conven-
ient record of all your expenses, and they generally offer relatively good
exchange rates. You can also withdraw cash advances from your credit
cards at banks or ATMs, provided you know your PIN. If you’ve forgotten
yours, or didn’t even know you had one, call the number on the back
of your credit card and ask the bank to send it to you. It usually takes
5 to 7 business days, though some banks will provide the number over
the phone if you tell them your mother’s maiden name or some other
personal information. 
Even though the Bahamian dollar is equivalent to the U.S. dollar, the two
currencies are still different. If you use a credit or debit card, when you
receive your monthly statement, note that the bank or credit card com-
pany added a currency conversion fee (usually about 2 percent) to your
charges.
Some credit card companies recommend that you notify them of any
impending trip abroad so that they don’t become suspicious when the
card is used numerous times in an unusual location. If the company
becomes suspicious, it may block your charges. Even if you don’t call
your credit card company in advance, you can always call the card’s
emergency number if a charge is refused.
Converting currency
Conversion ratios between the U.S. or Bahamian dollar and other curren-
cies fluctuate, and their differences could affect the relative costs of
your holiday. The figures in Table 5-2 were valid at the time of this writ-
ing, but they may not be valid by the time you depart. This table would
still be useful for conversions of small amounts of money, but if you plan
to make any major transactions, check for more updated rates prior to
any serious commitments.

Dealing with a Lost or Stolen Wallet
Be sure to contact all your credit card companies the minute you dis-
cover that your wallet’s been lost or stolen. Then file a report at the
nearest police precinct. Your credit card company or insurer may
require a police report number or a record of the loss. Most credit card
companies have an emergency number to call if you lose your card or it
gets stolen; they may be able to wire you a cash advance immediately or
deliver an emergency credit card in a day or two. Call the following
emergency numbers:
 American Express: % 800-221-7282
 MasterCard: % 800-307-7309
 Visa: % 800-847-2911
If you need emergency cash over the weekend when all banks and
American Express offices are closed, you can have Western Union
wire money to you (% 800-325-6000; www.westernunion.com).
Identity theft and fraud are potential complications of losing your wallet,
especially if you lose your driver’s license along with your cash and
credit cards. Notify the major credit-reporting bureaus immediately;
placing a fraud alert on your records may protect you against liability
for criminal activity. The three major U.S. credit-reporting agencies are
 Equifax: % 888-766-0008; www.equifax.com
 Experian: % 888-397-3742; www.experian.com
 TransUnion: % 800-680-7289; www.transunion.com
Finally, if you lose all forms of photo ID, call your airline and explain the
situation. The airline may allow you to board the plane if you have a
copy of your passport or birth certificate and a copy of the police report
that you filed.

Chapter 6
Getting to The Bahamas
In This Chapter
 Securing a great deal on a flight
 Cruising to The Bahamas
 Deciding if packages are right for you
U
nless you’re a long-distance swimmer, you have to get to The
Bahamas by air (commercial, chartered, or private plane) or by
sea (cruise ship or ferry). Of course, the quickest, easiest, and most 
convenient way to reach The Bahamas is by plane. Many people enjoy
cruising to The Bahamas, although these trips mean spending a lot more
time on the surf than on the turf.
Flying to The Bahamas
New York and Miami are the most popular U.S. gateway cities from
which to fly to Nassau (New Providence and Paradise Islands) and to
Freeport/Lucaya (Grand Bahama Island). Several other U.S. cities,
including Philadelphia and Atlanta, also offer direct service.
Nassau is the busiest and most popular entry point. From here, you can
make travel arrangements to many of the remote Out Islands. Freeport,
on Grand Bahama, also has its own airport, which serves flights from the
U.S. mainland, too.
Flight time to Nassau from Miami is about 35 minutes; from New York,
two hours and 30 minutes; from Atlanta, two hours and 5 minutes; from
Philadelphia, two hours and 45 minutes; from Charlotte, two hours and
10 minutes; from central Florida, one hour and 10 minutes; and from
Toronto, three hours.
Connecting airlines and islands
To help you get started making your travel arrangements, we break this
section down island by island so that you can tell how easy — or how
difficult — it is to reach the vacation spot you have in mind.

We list information about only nonstop flights and direct flights (where
you may touch down once, but you don’t have to change planes).
Therefore, if you’re not starting from one of the cities mentioned in the
preceding section, you probably have to change planes or even airlines
to get to the island of your choice. Keep in mind that no matter where
you start, to get to some of the smaller cays, you have to fly to one
island and then take a ferry or switch to a small airline. (See the individ-
ual island chapters for complete details.) Planes flying from Florida to
The Bahamas and from Nassau (New Providence) to other Bahamian
islands often carry fewer than 30 or 40 passengers.
Also, remember that flight schedules always change, so use the informa-
tion in this section to get a rough idea of what’s available. Some routes
are seasonal, with fewer flights or no flights at all, at various times of the
year. For up-to-the-minute details, call the airlines directly or check their
Web sites.
Flying to Nassau, New Providence (for Nassau, Cable Beach, and
Paradise Island): American Eagle (% 800-433-7300; www.aa.com)
offers about 12 flights each day from Miami to Nassau, as well as less 
frequent service from Ft. Lauderdale, Orlando, and Tampa. Bahamasair
(% 800-222-4262; www.bahamasair.com) flies from West Palm Beach,
Miami, Ft. Lauderdale, and Orlando to Nassau. Continental Airlines
(% 800-525-0280; www.continental.com) offers daily flights to
Nassau from Newark, Miami, Ft. Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach. Delta
(% 800-241-4141; www.delta.com) has several flights to Nassau, pro-
viding service from Atlanta, Orlando, and New York’s LaGuardia Airport.
JetBlue (% 800-JET-BLUE; www.jetblue.com), has one direct flight
daily to Nassau, from JFK in New York. U.S. Airways (% 800-428-4322;

least one flight daily to Miami, where a staggering number of connections
are available to Nassau and many other points within the archipelago
on several carriers. Prospective visitors from Australia or New Zealand
usually fly to London, where they take a connecting flight across the
Atlantic to Nassau on British Airways.
Flying to Paradise Island: Most visitors to Paradise Island arrive in
Nassau and commute to Paradise Island by ground transport. However,
Chalk’s International Airlines (% 800-424-2557 or 242-363-3115; www.
chalksoceanairways.com) flies daily from Ft. Lauderdale International
Airport directly to Paradise Island. This airline offers about five flights
on weekdays and around eight flights on Saturdays and Sundays. The air-
planes are Grumman G-73Ts; each aircraft carries up to 17 passengers.

daily from Nassau and West Palm Beach. You can find other connections
aboard Twin Air (% 954-359-8266; www.flytwinair.com), which wings
in from Ft. Lauderdale. Continental Connection (% 800-525-0280; www.
continental.com) flies to Treasure Cay from several Florida locales.
Getting to Eleuthera and Harbor Island: Bahamasair (% 800-222-4262;
www.bahamasair.com) flies daily from Nassau to North Eleuthera,
where you catch the ferry to Harbour Island. U.S. Airways Express
(% 800-428-4322; www.usairways.com) flies daily from Miami and
West Palm Beach to North Eleuthera.
Flying to George Town, Exuma: The most popular way to visit the Exumas
is to fly aboard Bahamasair (% 800-222-4262; www.bahamasair.com),
which offers twice-daily service from Nassau to George Town. Flights
usually begin leaving Nassau sometime around 6:30 a.m., depending on
the day. Be sure to call ahead, because flight schedules can change.
American Eagle (% 800-433-7300; www.aa.com) serves Exuma from
Miami daily. Other minor carriers that serve the archipelago include
Chapter 6: Getting to The Bahamas 83

Lynx Air International (% 888-596-9247; www.lynxair.com), which has
flights on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, with links from Ft. Lauderdale.
Air Sunshine (% 800-327-8900 or 954-434-8900; www.airsunshine.com)
flies from Ft. Lauderdale, but only on Mondays and Thursdays. You can
return to Ft. Lauderdale aboard this airline on Mondays and Fridays.
Flying to San Salvador: Bahamasair (% 800-222-4262; www.bahamasair.
com) offers flights six days a week from Nassau. Flight times constantly
change. The island’s most popular hotel, Club Med (% 800-CLUBMED
[888-WEB-CLUB] or 242-331-2000) flies guests in on weekly charter flights
from Miami. In winter, charter flights from New York are available once
a week.
Getting the best deal on your airfare
Competition among the major U.S. airlines is unlike that of any other
industry. Every airline offers virtually the same product (basically, a
coach seat is a coach seat is a . . .), yet prices can vary by hundreds of
dollars.
Business travelers who need the flexibility of buying their tickets at the
last minute and changing their itineraries at a moment’s notice — and
who want to get home before the weekend — pay (or at least their com-
panies pay) the premium rate, known as the full fare. But if you can book
your ticket far in advance, stay over Saturday night, and travel midweek
(Tues–Thurs), you can qualify for the least expensive price — usually a
fraction of the full fare. On most flights — even the shortest hops within
the U.S. — the full fare is close to $1,000 or more, but a 7- or 14-day
advance-purchase ticket may cost you less than half of that amount.
Obviously, planning ahead pays.
Periodically, the airlines hold sales in which they lower the prices on
their most popular routes. These fares have advance-purchase require-
ments and date-of-travel restrictions, but you can’t beat the prices.
As you plan your vacation, keep your eyes open for these sales, which
tend to take place in seasons that have low travel volume — from May
to October for The Bahamas.
Consolidators, also known as “bucket shops,” are great sources for inter-
national tickets, although they usually can’t beat the Internet on fares
within North America. Start by looking in travel sections in the Sunday
newspaper; U.S. travelers should focus on the New York Times, Los
Angeles Times, and The Miami Herald.
Bucket-shop tickets are usually nonrefundable or are rigged with stiff can-
cellation penalties, often as high as 50 to 75 percent of the ticket price.
And some bucket shops put you on charter airlines with questionable
safety records. Ask plenty of questions before you fork over your money.
Travel (% 800-781-4040; www.statravel.com), the world’s leader in
student travel, offers good fares for travelers of all ages. ELTExpress
Part II: Planning Your Trip to The Bahamas 
84

(Flights.com; % 800-TRAV-800; www.eltexpress.com) has excellent
fares worldwide, particularly to Europe. FlyCheap (% 800-FLY-CHEAP;
www.1800flycheap.com) is owned by package-holiday megalith
MyTravel and so has especially good access to fares for sunny destina-
tions. Air Tickets Direct (% 800-778-3447; www.airticketsdirect.
com) is based in Montreal and leverages the currently weak Canadian
dollar for low fares; it also books trips to places that U.S. travel agents
won’t touch, such as Cuba.
Frequent-flier membership doesn’t cost a cent, but it does entitle you
to better seats, faster response to phone inquiries, and prompter service
if your luggage is stolen or your flight is canceled or delayed, or if you
want to change your seat. And you don’t have to fly to earn points; 
frequent-flier credit cards can earn you thousands of miles for doing
your everyday shopping. With more than 70 mileage awards programs
on the market, consumers have never had more options. Investigate the
program details of your favorite airlines before you sink points into any
one. Consider which airlines have hubs in the airport nearest you, and,
of those carriers, which have the most advantageous alliances, given
your most common routes. To play the frequent-flier game to your best
advantage, consult Randy Petersen’s Inside Flyer (www.insideflyer.
com). Petersen and friends review all the programs in detail and post 
regular updates on changes in policies and trends.
Booking your flight online
The “big three” online travel agencies, Expedia (www.expedia.com),
Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), and Orbitz (www.orbitz.com),
sell most of the air tickets bought on the Internet. (Canadian travelers
should try www.expedia.ca and www.travelocity.ca; U.K. residents
can go for expedia.co.uk and opodo.co.uk.) Each has different busi-
ness deals with the airlines and may offer different fares on the same
flights, so shopping around is wise. Expedia and Travelocity will also
send you an e-mail notification when a cheap fare to your favorite 
destination becomes available. Of the smaller travel agency Web sites,
SideStep (www.sidestep.com) receives good reviews from users. It pur-
ports to “search 140 sites at once,” but in reality only beats competitors’
fares as often as other sites do.
If you’re willing to give up some control over your flight details, use a
service like Priceline (www.priceline.com; www.priceline.co.uk for
Europeans) or Hotwire (www.hotwire.com). Both companies offer rock-
bottom prices in exchange for traveling on a “mystery airline” at a mys-
terious time of day, often with a mysterious change of planes en route.
The mystery airlines are all major, well-known carriers, and the airlines’
routing computers are a lot better than they used to be. But your chances
of getting a 6 a.m. or 11 p.m. flight are pretty high. Hotwire tells you the
flight prices before you buy; Priceline usually has better deals than
Hotwire, and you now also have the option to pick your flights, times,
and airlines from a list of low prices that Priceline offers.
Chapter 6: Getting to The Bahamas 85

Great last-minute deals are also available directly from the airlines 
themselves through a free e-mail service called E-savers. Each week, the
airline sends you a list of discounted flights, usually leaving the upcom-
ing Friday or Saturday and returning the following Monday or Tuesday.
You can sign up for all the major airlines at one time by logging on to
Smarter Travel (www.smartertravel.com), or you can go to each indi-
vidual airline’s Web site. Airline sites also offer schedules, flight booking,
and information on late-breaking bargains.

Cruising to The Bahamas
Cruises to The Bahamas are usually either three- or four-day weekend
getaways or week-long itineraries. If you go on a week-long cruise, the
ship may stop at Nassau, Freeport, and/or one of several privately
owned Bahamian islands for a day at the beach en route to Caribbean
ports farther south.
If you’ve never been to The Bahamas, consider taking a cruise to
Nassau, where you can also enjoy Paradise Island and Cable Beach on
the same visit. Nassau has better shopping possibilities, better restau-
rants, and more entertainment than any other site in The Bahamas.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to The Bahamas 
86
Just a ferry ride away
A great way to get from the Florida coast to Freeport is aboard a modern ferryboat,
the sleek Cloud X, which transports you there in three hours. Launched in 2004, the
ferry sets sail from the port of Palm Beach Thursday to Monday at 9 a.m., with a return
voyage from Freeport at 6:15 p.m. The round-trip fare is $119 for adults, $80 for children
ages 6 to 12, and free for kids 5 and under. A $38 port charge is levied on passengers
of all ages. A trio of comfortable lounges, two bars, and a casino are on board to entertain.
This 367-passenger vessel sails under a U.S. flag. For more information, call % 866-
GO-FERRY (866-463-3779) or visit www.cloudx.com.

We provide a summary of cruise lines that sail to The Bahamas in the
upcoming section, but for detailed information, consider picking up a
copy of Cruise Vacations For Dummies or Frommer’s Caribbean Cruises &
Ports of Call.
Regardless of the ship you choose, your cruise will most likely depart
from the cruise capital of the world, Miami. A handful of vessels
also depart for Bahamian waters from Port Everglades (adjacent to
Ft. Lauderdale), Port Canaveral, and, in very rare instances, New York.
Many cruise-ship passengers combine a three- or four-day cruise with
visits to Orlando’s theme parks, Miami’s South Beach, the Florida
Everglades, or the Florida Keys and Key West.
Nearly all cabins aboard ships today have two twin beds that you can
push together, plus storage space (of varying size), a shower and a toilet
(ditto), and sometimes a TV showing a rotating stock of programs. If you
want to keep costs to a minimum when booking, ask for one of the
smaller, inside cabins (one without windows). If you’re the type who
likes being active all day and staying out late to enjoy the ship’s bars
and nightclubs, you won’t miss the sunshine anyway. On the other hand,
passengers of means can get suites that have an amazing array of pam-
pering options (including hot tubs on their own private verandas!).
Because cruise lines buy in bulk, they typically offer some of the best
deals on airfare to your port of embarkation. They also typically offer
extension packages that allow pre- or post-cruise stays at a hotel or
resort.
Getting around Freeport/Lucaya or Nassau is relatively easy, and the 
official shore excursions that most ships offer are dull and sometimes
restrictive, so decide what you want to do (shopping, swimming, snor-
keling, or gambling) and head off on your own during your stop at each
port of call. You certainly have time to relax at the beach or to enjoy
watersports (the chapters that follow give you details on what compa-
nies or outfitters to contact for equipment, so don’t feel dependent on
the cruise line for everything).
In Nassau, cruise ships anchor at piers along Prince George Wharf. Taxi
drivers meet all arrivals and can transport you into the heart of Nassau —
the center of most shopping and sightseeing activities. Duty-free shops
also lie just outside the dock area, but for shopping, you’re better off
going inside the city’s commercial and historic core.
As you disembark, a tourist information office is visible in a tall pink
tower, where you can pick up maps of New Providence Island or of
Nassau itself. The tourist information office conducts one-hour walking
tours from here if you’d like an overview of the city, with a guide point-
ing out historic monuments. Outside this office, an ATM can supply you
with U.S. dollars if your cash is running low. (For more information on
money issues, see Chapter 5.)
Chapter 6: Getting to The Bahamas 87

On Grand Bahama Island, your cruise ship will dock at a dull industrial-
looking wasteland on the western part of the island, far removed from
the center of all the action at Freeport or Lucaya. For shopping, sightsee-
ing, the best beaches, or gambling, you must take a $10 taxi ride to the
resort areas. Taxis await all arriving cruise ships.
Reviewing the major cruise lines
Here’s a rundown of the major cruise lines that serve The Bahamas.
Most of them focus on either Nassau or Freeport (or both).
 Carnival Cruise Line (% 888-CARNIVAL; www.carnival.com):
The cruise line that everyone’s heard of offers a big, loud, flashy
cruise party with lots of gambling, glitz, and crowds, so if you’re
looking for some quiet, reflective time, this cruise may not be your
cup of rum. Carnival’s best bet for The Bahamas is aboard the
Fantasy, which sails on three-night loops to Nassau and four-night
excursions to both Freeport and Nassau. Similar in appeal is the
Fascination, which visits Nassau and attracts passengers seeking a
“long weekend” at sea and in port.
 Disney Cruise Line (% 800-951-3532; www.disneycruise.com):
Launched with lots of publicity in 1999, the Disney Wonder is satu-
rated with the total Disney vibe and is specifically marketed to 
families. It succeeds in mingling state-of-the-art technology and
audiovisuals with lots of Disney razzle-dazzle. Disney also offers
the best-designed family cabins of any cruise ship, the biggest chil-
dren’s facilities, and even a number of adults-only areas, including
one swimming pool, a piano bar, a comedy club, and various social
venues. The three- and four-night Bahamian cruises depart from
Port Canaveral, Florida.
 Norwegian Cruise Line (% 800-327-7030; www.ncl.com): Norwegian
Cruise Line offers seven-night Florida-Bahamas transits aboard the
Norwegian Dawn, visiting Nassau and Great Stirrup Cay (the cruise
line’s private island). Generally inexpensive and emphasizing sports,
these ships attract a lot of active travelers in the 24-to-45 age bracket.
Activities and cuisine are routine but adequate. Passengers who
book on this cruise line want to travel to a hot-weather destination
in winter but don’t want to spend lavish sums for the experience.
A wide variety of cabins are available at a range of prices to cater
to a more diverse clientele than those usually found aboard Holland
America or Celebrity ships.
 Royal Caribbean International (% 866-3562-7626; www.
royalcaribbean.com): This is another cruise line that offers
The Bahamas (Nassau and Freeport) as a specific destination
instead of including the archipelago as a one-night stopover. Things
run smoothly on this middle-of-the-road cruise line, which has a
less frenetic atmosphere than Carnival’s mega-ships but a livelier
one than Celebrity or Holland America. The company is well run,
Part II: Planning Your Trip to The Bahamas 
88

and it offers enough on-board activities to suit virtually any taste
and age level. Although accommodations and facilities are more
than adequate, they’re not upscale, and cabins aboard some of the
line’s older vessels tend to be a bit more cramped than the indus-
try norm.
Getting the best deal on your cruise
Cruise lines operate like airlines, setting rates for their cruises and then
selling them in a rapid-fire series of discounts, offering almost whatever
it takes to fill their ships. For this reason, great deals come and go in the
blink of an eye, and most deals are available only through travel agents.
If you have a travel agent who you trust, leave the details to her. If not,
try contacting a travel agent who specializes in booking cruises. Some of
the most likely contenders include the following:
 Cruises, Inc., 1415 NW 62 St., Ft. Lauderdale, FL 33009 (% 866-325-
6893; www.cruisesinc.com)
 Cruises Only, 1011 E. Colonial Dr., Orlando, FL 32803 (% 800-278-
4737; www.cruisesonly.com)
 The Cruise Company, 10760 Q St., Omaha, NE 68127 (% 800-289-
5505; www.thecruisecompany.com)
 Kelly Cruises, 1315 W. 22nd St., Suite 105, Oak Brook, IL 60523
(% 800-837-7447; www.kellycruises.com)
 Hartford Holidays Travel, 129 Hillside Ave., Williston Park, NY
11596 (% 800-828-4813; www.hartfordholidays.com)
 Mann Travel and Cruises, 4400 Park Rd., Charlotte, NC 28209
(% 866-591-8129; www.manntravelandcruises.com)
Choosing a Package Deal
For The Bahamas, package deals can be a smart way to go. In many
cases, a package that includes airfare, hotel, and transportation to and
from the airport costs less than the hotel alone that you book yourself.
The reason is because tour operators buy packages in bulk and then
resell them to the public. 
Package tours can vary widely. Some package tours offer better classes
of hotel than others; others provide the same hotels for lower prices.
Some packages book flights on scheduled airlines; others sell charters.
In some packages, your choice of accommodations and travel days may
be limited. Some packages let you choose between escorted vacations
and independent vacations; others allow you to add just a few excur-
sions or escorted day trips (also at discounted prices) without booking
an entirely escorted tour.
Chapter 6: Getting to The Bahamas 89

If you’re dreaming of getting away from it all on one of The Bahamas’
undeveloped Out Islands, finding good package deals may be hard. Most
packagers concentrate on the larger hotels on the more popular islands,
such as New Providence or Grand Bahama.
To find package tours, check out the travel section of your local Sunday
newspaper or the ads in the back of national travel magazines, such as
Travel + Leisure, National Geographic Traveler, and Condé Nast Traveler.
Liberty Travel (call % 888-271-1584 to find the store nearest you;
www.libertytravel.com) is one of the biggest packagers in the
Northeast and usually boasts a full-page ad in Sunday papers.
Some packagers specialize in types of trips, such as scuba-diving adven-
tures, golf getaways, or casino excursions. Likewise, a few of the larger
hotels, such as the all-inclusive Club Med on San Salvador, offer money-
saving hotel packages that include charter flights. If you already know
where you want to stay, call that resort and ask whether it offers land/air
packages.
Another good source of package deals is the airlines themselves. Most
major airlines offer air/land packages. Several big online travel agencies —
Expedia (www.expedia.com), Travelocity (www.travelocity.com),
Orbitz (www.orbitz.com), Site59 (www.site59.com), and Lastminute.com
(www.lastminute.com) — also do a brisk business in packages. If you’re
unsure about the pedigree of a smaller packager, check with the Better
Business Bureau in the city where the company is based or go online to
www.bbb.org. If a packager won’t tell you where it’s based, don’t book
with it.
Here are some of the packagers that we prefer:
 American Airlines Vacations (% 800-321-2121; www.aavacations.
com) can arrange packages to Nassau, Cable Beach, and Paradise
Island (New Providence); Freeport/Lucaya (Grand Bahama); and
Exuma. These economical deals include discounted airfare,
hotel, and, if you like, a rental car, as well as meals (at certain
accommodations).
 American Express Vacations (% 800-335-3342; www.american
express.com) books trips to a couple of the smaller Bahamian
islands that many packagers ignore: Green Turtle Cay in the Abacos
and Harbour Island off the coast of Eleuthera. Of course, the com-
pany also sets up air/land packages to the most popular resort
areas: Nassau, Cable Beach, and Paradise Island (New Providence);
and Freeport/Lucaya (Grand Bahama). Nonstop charter flights from
Newark, New York, and Miami can take you to Nassau or Freeport.
 British Airways (% 0870-850-9850 in the U.K. or 800-247-9297 in
the U.S.; www.britishairways.com) offers travelers direct flights
Part II: Planning Your Trip to The Bahamas 
90

from Gatwick Airport outside London to Nassau. Call the airline or
visit the Web site for information on package deals.
 Caribbean Dive Tours (% 800-433-DIVE; www.worlddive.com)
makes one-stop shopping especially attractive, because this com-
pany arranges scuba-diving trips for individuals or groups that
include airfare, hotel, meals (in some cases), and all dives and gear.
 Club Med (% 888-WEB-CLUB; www.clubmed.com) features all-
inclusive options on Paradise Island and San Salvador.
 Continental Airlines Vacations (% 800-301-3800; www.
covacations.com) customizes hotel and air packages to Nassau,
Cable Beach, and Paradise Island that include transfers to and from
the airport. Depending on what hotel you choose, you can throw in
breakfast or both breakfast and dinner.
 Delta Vacations (% 800-221-6666; www.deltavacations.com)
coordinates packages from New York or Atlanta to Nassau, Cable
Beach, and Paradise Island that include air, hotel, and transfers
between your accommodations and the airport.
 Frontiers International (% 800-245-1950 or 724-935-1577;
www.frontierstrvl.com) features fly- and spin-fishing tours of
The Bahamas and specializes in saltwater-fishing destinations.
 Grand Bahama Vacations (% 800-545-1300; www.grandbahama
vacations.com) books charter flights with Laker Airways to
Freeport/Lucaya (Grand Bahama) twice a week from Ft. Lauderdale,
Baltimore, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Hartford, Memphis, Nashville,
Raleigh, Richmond, and Pittsburgh, as well as every other Saturday
from West Palm Beach. When you reserve your flight, you can also
book a bed at one of more than a dozen Grand Bahama hotels.
 Just-A-Vacation, Inc. (% 800-683-6313; www.justavacation.com)
specializes in all-inclusive resorts on the islands of The Bahamas,
mainly Nassau/Paradise Island and Grand Bahama Island.
 Kuoni Travel (% 01306-742-222; www.kuoni.co.uk) is another
British specialist that offers both land and air packages to The
Bahamas, including such destinations as Nassau and Freeport,
and to some places in the Out Islands. They also offer packages for
self-catering villas on Paradise Island.
 Maduro Dive Fanta-Seas (% 800-327-6709; www.maduro.com) can
set up a complete dive trip with one phone call. Packages for indi-
viduals or groups include airfare, hotel, meals (if you want them),
and all dives and gear.
 U.S. Airways Vacations (% 800-455-0123; www.usairways
vacations.com) arranges air/hotel packages, with nonstop
service to Nassau from Philadelphia or Charlotte, North Carolina.

hen visiting an archipelago as vast and, in some cases, as difficult
to reach as parts of The Bahamas are, choosing where to hang
your hat becomes all-important. Visiting The Bahamas isn’t like visiting a
city where you can check out of a hotel you don’t like the next morning
and take a taxi to another one.
Throughout this guide, we give you honest and candid descriptions
about what to expect from a hotel. We hope to match you up with the
right location for your island fantasy because if you land in the wrong
place, especially if you’ve already prepaid, your vacation may be disap-
pointing. This chapter tells you what you need to know about the types
of accommodations awaiting you on each island. In Grand Bahama and
New Providence, you have plenty of choices. In the Out Islands, the lack
of accommodations greatly restricts you.
Getting to Know Your Options
The Bahamas offer a wide selection of accommodations, ranging from
small private guesthouses to large luxury resorts. Hotels vary in size and
facilities, from deluxe (offering room service, sports, swimming pools,
entertainment, and so on) to fairly simple Out Island inns.
Hotel properties in the islands aren’t rated according to any rigid classi-
fication system or “star system.” The word “deluxe” is often used (or
misused) when “first class” may be the more appropriate term. “First
class” itself often isn’t first class. For those reasons and others, we pre-
sent fairly detailed descriptions of the properties in destination-specific
chapters throughout the book to give you an idea of what to expect.

However, even in the deluxe and first-class resorts and hotels, don’t
expect top-rate service and efficiency. “Things,” as they’re called in the
islands, don’t seem to work as well here as they do in certain fancy
resorts of California, Florida, and Europe.
Travelers to The Bahamas have the following options:
 Hotels, resorts, and inns
 All-inclusive resorts
 Villas, condos, and timeshares
 Guesthouses
No matter which option you choose, our accommodations’ price ranges
apply throughout the book. Check out Table 7-1 for an explanation of the
dollar sign symbols and the amenities you can expect at each price level.
Table 7-1
Key to Hotel Dollar Signs
Dollar Sign(s)
Price Range
What to Expect
$
$100 or less 
These accommodations are relatively simple and 
than $100
inexpensive. Rooms are likely to be small, and you
may not have a TV in your room. In some cases,
you may not have a phone in your room.
$$
$101–$200
These midrange accommodations are a bit
classier and offer more room, more extras (such
as irons, hair dryers, or microwaves), and a more
convenient location — perhaps on the beach —
than the preceding category.
$$$
$201–$300
Higher-class still, these accommodations begin
looking plush. Think chocolates on your pillow, a
classy restaurant, and maybe even expansive
views of a white sandy beachfront.
$$$$
$301 and up
These top-rate, most often beachfront, accommoda-
tions come with luxurious amenities, such as valet
parking, on-premise spas, and in-room hot tubs and
CD players — but you pay through the nose for ’em.
Hotels, resorts, and inns: Enjoying your stay
If you want to live in luxury, your best and sometimes only bets are
found on New Providence, with its array of hotels and resorts spread
from Cable Beach to Nassau to Paradise Island. The second-largest con-
centration of hotels and resorts is on Grand Bahama Island, mainly
around Freeport or Lucaya.
Chapter 7: Booking Your Accommodations 93

Except for certain pockets of luxury, such as Harbour Island off the
coast of Eleuthera, resort pickings grow slim as you explore the Out
Islands. Hotels are small except Club Med on San Salvador and the
Four Seasons Resort in the Exumas. Most of the Out Islands have inns
rather than large hotels. Some inns are very basic, often in dull concrete
blocks, but our recommendations have style and a bit of class.
We recommend mainstream hotels, resorts, and inns for
 Families that want plenty of amusements for their kids and sitters
close at hand
 Sports lovers who seek golf or watersports facilities
 Honeymooners or couples who want to focus on each other
 First-time visitors to The Bahamas
 Travelers with disabilities
Hotels and resorts also have a downside:
 Authentic island flavor doesn’t exist in most of these places.
 Guests tend to be resort-bound and don’t get to sample an island’s
offerings or charms.
 All the extra expenses add up quickly. You may get a shock when
it’s time to pay up.
All-inclusives: Simplifying your vacation
The all-inclusive resort concept finally has a foothold in The Bahamas.
At such resorts, one price includes everything — your room, all meals,
entertainment, many watersports (although some cost extra), and 
sometimes even drinks. Some people find that the cost of all-inclusive
holidays is cheaper than paying individually for each item, and others
appreciate knowing in advance what their final bill will be.
The first all-inclusive resort hotel in The Bahamas was Club Med
(% 888-WEB-CLUB), with its property on Paradise Island. This resort
isn’t a swinging-singles kind of place; it’s popular with everybody from
honeymooners to families. There’s another Club Med on San Salvador, in
the southern Bahamas, with more of a luxurious hideaway atmosphere.
The biggest all-inclusive resort of them all, Sandals (% 888-SANDALS;
www.sandals.com), came to Cable Beach in 1995. This Jamaican com-
pany is now walking its sandals across the Caribbean. The most famous
of the all-inclusives (but not necessarily the best), it caters only to
“Any two people in love.”
Part II: Planning Your Trip to The Bahamas 
94

Good candidates for all-inclusive resorts are
 Honeymooners
 Families
 Inexperienced travelers
 The budget-conscious
 The super-stressed
What are the downsides?
 Because you pay for everything in advance, you may feel obligated
to spend all your time at the resort and not venture out to see
what’s happening beyond the compound.
 At an all-inclusive resort, you live in a cocoon and miss what makes
your island special.
 Exuberant activity coordinators feel their job is to keep you occu-
pied day and night. This “organized fun” may not be for you.
Villas: Vacationing with the comforts of home
You may want to rent a villa, a good-sized apartment in someone’s condo
or timeshare, or even a small beach cottage (more accurately called a
cabaña).
Private apartments come with or without maid service, so ask upfront
exactly what to expect. This option is more no-frills than a villa or
condo. The apartments may not be in buildings with swimming pools,
and they may not have a front desk to help you.
Many cottages or cabañas open onto a beach, although others cluster
around a communal swimming pool. Most cottages are fairly simple,
containing no more than a plain bedroom plus a small kitchen and bath-
room. In the peak winter season, make reservations at least five or six
months in advance.
VHR Worldwide (% 800-633-3284 or 201-767-9393; www.vhrww.com)
offers the most comprehensive portfolio of luxury villas, condominiums,
resort suites, and apartments for rent not only in The Bahamas, but also
in the Caribbean. Hideaways Aficionado (% 800-843-4433 in the U.S. or
603-430-4433; www.hideaways.com), a travel club, publishes Hideaways
Insider, a 148-page pictorial directory of home rentals throughout the
world with full descriptions so you know what you’re renting. Rentals
range from cottages to staffed villas to whole islands. Annual member-
ship in Hideaways International costs $185 and includes perks such as
discounts on condos and resorts, and services such as airline ticketing
and car rentals.
Sometimes local tourist offices will also advise you on vacation-home
rentals if you write or call them directly.
Chapter 7: Booking Your Accommodations 95

We recommend villas for
 Families
 Groups of friends
 Honeymooners or couples craving privacy
 Independent travelers who want to connect with the island
But staying at a home-away-from-home also has its downsides:
 You don’t get the extensive dining facilities and other amenities of a
resort.
 A villa may not offer daily maid service and other niceties (like a
pool or Jacuzzi) that you consider vital to your relaxation.
 Few villas are located right on the beach; resorts usually snag the
prime real estate.
 You definitely won’t get (or be subjected to, depending on your
point of view) the nightly entertainment that almost every
Bahamian hotel trumpets.
 You’re more isolated, so you’d better really like your traveling com-
panion (if you have one).
 Of all the travel options, villas are the least likely to live up to their
brochure promises.
We recommend condos and cabañas for
 Families. You can feed your kids what you want and not suffer dis-
approving looks from the honeymooners at the next table when
junior flips his soggy cereal onto the floor.
 Groups of friends.
 Older couples looking for quiet.
 Long-term vacationers. Cooking your own meals is a great money-
saving tactic for an extended stay on an island.
 Independent travelers who want to connect with the island and its
people.
What are some drawbacks to staying at a condo or cabaña?
 You have all the comforts of home, but also all the work.
 Amenities are limited.
 You entrust your tropical dream to someone else’s decorating taste.
 When dinnertime comes, you’re the staff as well as the diner.

Guesthouses: Living like a Bahamian
The B&B-style guesthouse is where many Bahamians stay when they’re
traveling in their own islands. In The Bahamas, however, the term
“guesthouse” can mean anything. Sometimes so-called guesthouses are
really simple motels built around swimming pools. Others are small indi-
vidual cottages, with their own kitchenettes, constructed around a main
building in which you often find a bar and restaurant serving local food.
In the Out Islands, the guesthouses are no-frills. The ones we recom-
mend are clean and decent for families or single women. Many of these
guesthouses are very basic. Salt spray takes a serious toll on metal or
fabric, and chipped paint is commonplace. Bathrooms can fall into the
vintage category, and sometimes the water isn’t heated — but when the
weather is 85°F to 92°F outside, you don’t need hot water anyway.
On the other hand, some of these places are quite comfortable. A few
guesthouses are almost luxurious; and, in addition to giving you the
opportunity to live with a local family, they boast swimming pools, pri-
vate bathrooms in all rooms, and air-conditioning.
We recommend guesthouses for
 Older couples who like the bed-and-breakfast concept
 Long-term vacationers on tight budgets
 The independent traveler who needs a home base
Here are some of the drawbacks to staying at a guesthouse:
 You may be far from the beach, without a pool.
 The digs may not be glamorous.
 You may not get along with your host.
 Housekeeping standards vary widely.
 If a problem occurs, you’re stuck dealing one-on-one with the
homeowner.
Locating Lodging that Suits You
Where you want to sleep often determines your choice of island. The type
of accommodations you have in mind means that you should consider
some islands and write off others. For example, perhaps you’re dreaming
of napping in your personal hammock at the edge of a secluded beach
right in front of your individually decorated bungalow. Your choices are
very limited on New Providence and Grand Bahama. However, The
Bahamas’ Out Islands offer lots of small, peaceful, beachfront lodgings.
Chapter 7: Booking Your Accommodations 97

If your ideal vacation includes a hotel with a wide variety of restaurants,
Las Vegas–style extravaganzas, and nightly dancing, steer clear of The
Bahamas’ Out Islands and head to Cable Beach on New Providence,
Paradise Island, or Grand Bahama.
Certain hotels allow children under a set age to stay free or at reduced
rates in a room with an adult. Many dining rooms offer children’s menus
with lower prices and smaller portions than the regular fare. Policies
vary, so be sure to ask when making reservations.
Rooming on the main islands
Rooms in the larger hotels on New Providence, Paradise Island, and Grand
Bahama are air-conditioned (some also have ceiling fans) and come with
satellite TV and direct-dial telephones. Most rooms have two double beds
or one king-size bed, plus a balcony or patio. Many rooms are also
equipped with irons and ironing boards, coffeemakers, minibars or refrig-
erators, hair dryers, and in-room safes. Some rooms have Internet access
and sometimes even CD players. Hotels have U.S. newspapers — usually
from Miami or New York — available. Expect to find plenty of activities,
along with restaurants, shops, salons, and (on the premises or nearby)
watersports operators. Many hotels also have wheelchair-accessible
rooms. Likewise, some hotels offer supervised children’s programs.
In some cases, you’re on your own, without on-premises restaurants or
activities desks to provide information, help you set up excursions, call
taxis, or assist with other arrangements.
Bahamian landlords offer plenty of villas and condos for rent on the
main islands, but first-time visitors may want to skip them because you
should be familiar with the island and getting around by car.
The more elegant and expensive villa rentals offer maid service, and in
some cases, even your own cook — for an extra fee, of course. At cheaper
rentals, you may have to do your own cleaning and cooking.
Choosing the less developed islands
You won’t find high-rise hotels in the Out Islands. A few islands offer
posh digs with rooms and facilities as snazzy as the ones on busier
islands — for example, Pink Sands on Harbour Island (see Chapter 22)
or Green Turtle Club & Marina on Green Turtle Cay in the Abacos
(see Chapter 20). Still, these low-rise lodgings are far less formal than
upscale hotels on New Providence, Paradise Island, or Grand Bahama.
Accommodations on the less developed islands may or may not have
air-conditioning, but ceiling fans or good cross-ventilation does the trick
if they don’t. Some rooms have two double beds, and others have only
one. In rare cases, some rooms offer only twin beds. In the Out Islands,
many hotel rooms don’t have telephones, TVs, or radios. In hotels that
Part II: Planning Your Trip to The Bahamas 
98

do have TVs in the rooms, the channels are centrally controlled (usually
at the bar), so don’t be surprised if the mystery you’re watching sud-
denly turns into a soccer game just before the murderer’s identity is
revealed. If any of these amenities are important to you, ask about them
before you make your reservation.
In many cases in the Out Islands, you don’t have to worry about losing
your room key because you don’t get one in the first place. (No one
locks doors.) Forgot your beach reading? You’re likely to find a selection
of dog-eared paperbacks that previous vacationers left in your room.
You can even take one of those books home with you — as long as you
leave one of yours in its place.
You may be surprised to know that quite a few hotels have honor bars,
where no bartender is on duty. Guests simply take or mix their own
drinks, write them down, and pay for them when they check out. With
this trusting attitude, it’s no wonder that staff members at these small,
easygoing hotels quickly get to know guests. Staff members aren’t shy
about sharing tips about their favorite parts of the islands, either.
Independent families or groups of friends traveling together find villas,
condos, and hotel rooms with kitchens convenient places to stay on the
quieter, less developed islands. On less-developed islands, hotels are
small enough that managers themselves are usually willing to help you
make arrangements for watersports, dining, transportation, and other
activities that may or may not be on the premises.
If you or someone in your group is in a wheelchair, ask about the
specifics of the landscape and the facilities at hotels on the less 
developed islands. Some hotels, such as a few on Harbour Island and
Green Turtle Cay in the Abacos, have hilly grounds or lots of steps.
Understanding the Meal Plans
As you’re shopping around for your accommodations (whether while
consulting this guide or other sources like hotel Web sites), note that
prices are listed according to meal-plan options.
Many Bahamian resorts offer a European Plan (EP) rate, which means
that you pay only for the price of a room. Most of our hotel recommen-
dations have the EP rate listed. If you choose this option, you’re free to
dine at other resorts or restaurants. Another plan is the Continental
Plan (CP), which means that your room and a continental breakfast of
juice, coffee, bread, jam, and so on is included in a set price. A variation
of this plan is the Breakfast Plan (BP), which is a full traditional American-
style breakfast — eggs, bacon, pancakes, French toast, and hash browns.
Guests who don’t want to “dine around” at breakfast time prefer the
Continental and Breakfast plans.
Chapter 7: Booking Your Accommodations 99

Another major option is the Modified American Plan (MAP), which
includes breakfast and one main meal of the day, either lunch or dinner.
The final choice is the American Plan (AP), which includes breakfast,
lunch, and dinner. At certain resorts, you can save money by booking
either MAP or AP because the per-meal cost may be cheaper. If you dine
à la carte for lunch and dinner at various restaurants, your final dining
bill is likely to be much higher than if you stayed on the MAP or AP.
Aside from the savings in cost, meal plans have drawbacks if you like to
eat in a variety of places as a part of your holiday. You face the same
dining room every night, unless the resort you’re staying in has many
different restaurants on the dining plan. Many resorts have specialty
restaurants that serve a variety of cuisines, but these more expensive
restaurants aren’t included in MAP or AP and charge à la carte prices.
Dining at your hotel cuts down on transportation costs because taxis are
especially expensive. Nonetheless, if dining out and having many differ-
ent culinary experiences is your idea of a vacation and you’re willing to
pay the higher price, avoid AP plans or at least make sure that the hotel
where you’re staying has more than one dining room.
Before booking a room, investigate what you’re likely to save by booking
a dining plan. The meal-plan options may have a significant impact on
your choice of accommodations.
Finding the Best Room at the Best Rate
The rack rate is the maximum rate a hotel charges for a room. This rate
is the one you get when you walk in off the street and ask for a room for
the night. Hotel managers are happy to charge you the rack rate, but you
can almost always do better. Perhaps the best way to avoid paying the
rack rate is surprisingly simple: Just ask whether they can quote you a
better price. You may be pleasantly surprised.
In all but the smallest accommodations, a room’s price depends on how
you make your reservation. A travel agent may be able to negotiate a
better price with certain hotels than you can get by yourself. (The hotel
gives the agent a discount in exchange for steering her business toward
that hotel.) Making a reservation online through a hotel or airline Web
site often allows you to take advantage of special discounts. Reserving a
room through a hotel chain’s central toll-free number may not yield the
best rate because the representative may not be aware of local discounts.
Your best bet is to call both the local number and the toll-free number to
see which one gives you a better deal.
Package deals abound, and they’re always cheaper than rack rates.
Going to a reliable travel agent to find out what, if anything, is available
in the way of a land-and-air package before booking particular accommo-
dations is sometimes a good idea. For more on package deals, see
Chapter 6.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to The Bahamas 
100

To save money on accommodations, timing is also vital. The winter
season in The Bahamas runs roughly from the middle of December to
the middle of April, and hotels charge their highest prices during this
peak period. During the winter months, make reservations two months
in advance if you can. You can’t book early enough if you want to travel
over Christmas or in February.
The off season in The Bahamas — roughly from mid-April to mid-
December (although the off season varies from hotel to hotel) —
amounts to a sale. In most cases, hotels slash their rates by a startling
20 to 60 percent. This deal is a bonanza for cost-conscious travelers,
especially for families who can travel in the summer. For more tips on
helping you decide when to take your vacation in The Bahamas, see
Chapter 4.
Ask whether you can get an upgrade or a free night’s stay if you stay
an extra few days. If you travel during the marginal periods between
low and high season, you can sometimes delay your travel plans by
a week or ten days and get a substantial rate reduction. For example,
if you book a $300 room on April 12, the price may lower to $180 by
April 17 because mid-April marks the beginning of the low season in
The Bahamas.
Surfing the Web for hotel deals
Shopping online for hotels is generally done one of two ways: by booking
through the hotel’s own Web site; or through an independent booking
agency (or a fare-service agency like Priceline). These Internet hotel
agencies have multiplied in mind-boggling numbers of late, competing
for the business of millions of consumers surfing for accommodations
around the world. This competitiveness can be a boon to consumers
who have the patience and time to shop and compare the online sites
for good deals — but shop they must, for prices can vary considerably
from site to site. And keep in mind that hotels at the top of a site’s listing
may be there for no other reason than that they paid money to get the
placement.
In addition to Travelocity, Expedia, Orbitz, Priceline, and Hotwire, the
following Web sites will help you with booking hotel rooms online:
 www.hotels.com 
 www.quickbook.com
 www.travelaxe.net
 www.travelweb.com
 www.tripadvisor.com
It’s a good idea to get a confirmation number and make a printout of
any online booking transaction.
Chapter 7: Booking Your Accommodations 101

In the opaque Web site category, Priceline and Hotwire are even better
for hotels than for airfares; with both, you’re allowed to pick the neigh-
borhood and quality level of your hotel before offering up your money.
Priceline’s hotel product even covers Europe and Asia, though it’s much
better at getting five-star lodging for three-star prices than at finding
anything at the bottom of the scale. On the down side, many hotels stick
Priceline guests in their least desirable rooms. Be sure to go to the
BiddingForTravel Web site (www.biddingfortravle.com) before bid-
ding on a hotel room on Priceline; it features a fairly up-to-date list of
hotels that Priceline uses in major cities. For both Priceline and Hotwire,
you pay upfront, and the fee is nonrefundable. Note: Some hotels do not
provide loyalty program credits or points or other frequent-stay ameni-
ties when you book a room through opaque online services.
Reserving the best room
Somebody has to get the best room at a hotel or a resort, so it may as
well be you. Here’s how to go about getting the best room:
 Inquire about ceiling fans, air-conditioning, and whether the win-
dows open.
 Find out whether the room faces the water or the garage in back.
If you’re not going to spend a lot of time in your room, getting the
back view makes sense because it’s cheaper. Upper-floor rooms
with views cost more, too.
 Ask for a room, floor, or annex that was recently renovated.
 Ask about nonsmoking rooms.
 Avoid rooms overlooking outdoor nighttime entertainment or the
bar or lounge, if you’re a light sleeper.
Most Bahamian hoteliers wait until the slow season (summer) to do
major renovations. If you’re traveling other than in the winter months,
check to see whether your hotel is in the midst of renovating. If it is,
request a room away from the worksite. Those construction workers are
early risers.

O
ne-size-fits-all doesn’t pertain to vacations in The Bahamas.
Individual travelers or even people traveling with companions
or children often have special needs.
Some questions immediately come to mind. Where can couples honey-
moon or even tie the knot? What discounts or privileges can people
who’ve reached the golden age get? How wheelchair accessible are the
islands? Or are the islands gay friendly? In this chapter, we discuss the
challenges and opportunities that some travelers may encounter in The
Bahamas.
Traveling with the Brood: Advice for Families
If you have enough trouble getting your kids out of the house in the
morning, dragging them hundreds of miles away may seem like an 
insurmountable challenge. But family travel is immensely rewarding,
giving you new ways of seeing the world through smaller pairs of eyes.
A traveling brood plays a big part in your choices of accommodations,
dining, and activities. To help make matters easier, remember to look for
the Kid Friendly icon we use throughout this book. This icon calls atten-
tion to hotels and resorts, restaurants, or attractions that are especially
family friendly.
Kids vacationing at some beach resorts need not settle for just a sandy
shore. They’re treated to organized programs so comprehensive that
they rival summer camp. Some larger accommodations offer children’s
programs year-round.

Some programs are no more than a bored baby sitter in a room full of
toys or video games. Other programs have enthusiastic, well-trained
staff members who engage children in age-appropriate diversions,
from face painting and storytelling to beach Olympics and computer-
assisted science projects. Some resorts charge an additional fee for
their programs, but others are free to guests. Most resorts usually offer
morning and afternoon sessions, and meals and night sessions may also
be available. Most programs take children from around age 5 up to about
age 12.
The best kids’ programs are at Atlantis Paradise Island Resort & Casino
(Chapter 11) on Paradise Island, New Providence; Radisson Cable Beach
(see Chapter 11) on New Providence; and Westin Grand Bahama Island
at Our Lucaya Resort & Sheraton Grand Bahama Island at Our Lucaya
Resort (see Chapter 15) on Grand Bahama.
Here are some questions to ask when you’re evaluating a children’s 
program:
 What is the ratio of caretakers/counselors to children?
 Are kids divided into age groups?
 Exactly what activities do they engage in?
 How much time do the kids spend at the pool or beach, and what
kind of expert supervision do they have nearby or in the water?
 Are meals included?
 Do the children leave the drop-off area, and if so, where else do
they go?
Part II: Planning Your Trip to The Bahamas 
104
Flying with children
If you’re traveling with an infant, bring along a car seat to use on the plane. Because many
airlines allow children under age 2 to fly free when sitting on an adult’s lap, you may be
tempted not to purchase a seat for your child. Doing so really isn’t safe, however, because
turbulence can easily injure a child. You may wonder why you should bother buying a
ticket for your child when empty seats are often available. The problem is that if the
plane is full, you’re out of luck.
Don’t forget gum or lollipops for kids to chew or suck during takeoff and landing to
combat ear-pressure pain. And pack a deck of cards or some favorite toys to keep
them entertained. You may be used to hearing their mantra of “Are we there yet?” but
the whines of bored children can drive other passengers crazy. Flight attendants are
quite accommodating if you need to refrigerate baby bottles or if you have other child-
related requests.

Remember to specify any food allergies, to slather your younger editions
with sunscreen and, of course, to make sure that the caretakers know
where to find you in case of an emergency.
If you need a baby sitter for your smallest tots, you can hire one through
your hotel. Expect to pay around $12 to $15 an hour, plus $3 for each
additional child.
You can find good family-oriented vacation advice on the Internet from
sites like the Family Travel Network (www.familytravelnetwork.com),
which features excellent articles; Traveling Internationally with Your
Kids (www.travelwithyourkids.com), a comprehensive site that offers
sound advice for long-distance and international travel with children;
and Family Travel Files (www.thefamilytravelfiles.com), which
offers an online magazine and a directory of off-the-beaten-path tours
and tour operators for families.
Making Age Work for You: Tips for Seniors
Senior travelers to The Bahamas tend to gravitate toward New
Providence and Grand Bahama. For example, the Nassau Beach Hotel on
Cable Beach receives many repeat guests who’ve visited for decades,
and the British Colonial Hilton in downtown Nassau gets plenty of older
vacationers as well.
Although all the major U.S. airlines flying to The Bahamas canceled their
senior-discount and coupon-book programs, many hotels still offer dis-
counts for seniors. For the most part, The Bahamas charge the same
admission for all adults attending museums, theaters, and other attrac-
tions. Of course, asking about senior discounts doesn’t hurt. You may be
pleasantly surprised.

Accessing The Bahamas: Advice 
for Travelers with Disabilities
Travelers with disabilities have an easier time getting around on some
islands in The Bahamas than others. Many of the larger hotels on New
Providence, Paradise Island, and Grand Bahama offer ground-floor guest
rooms, wide bathrooms, and elevators that make wheelchair accessibil-
ity relatively easy. These islands also have plenty of sidewalks, marina
boardwalks, and paved pathways.
On the other hand, most hotels on the smaller islands have hilly grounds,
narrow, unpaved pathways, and steps leading to guest rooms or dining
areas. Several accommodations on Harbour Island, for example, sit at
the top of a bluff with long staircases that lead down to the beach.
Therefore, if you find a hotel that sounds good, call to ask about the
specifics of accessibility. If you’re in a wheelchair or you have trouble
walking but you want to get as close to the sand as possible, look for
hotels with accessible beachfront pool patios.
The Out Islands are more difficult to reach. The planes that service these
islands are usually small, and passengers board and disembark on narrow,
somewhat rickety staircases. In some instances, you need to change
planes once or twice and catch a ferry, as well as take a taxi or two.
If you’re a wheelchair-bound traveler heading to New Providence, you
can contact The Bahamas Association for the Physically Disabled
(% 242-322-2393) to rent a specially equipped van for airport pickup or
to arrange for transportation around the island. Make reservations as far
in advance of your trip as possible. You can get temporary ramps and
other portable aids through this association, too.
Many travel agencies offer customized tours and itineraries for travelers
with disabilities. Among them are Flying Wheels Travel (% 507-451-5005;
www.flyingwheelstravel.com), Access-Able Travel Source (% 303-
232-2979; www.access-able.com), and Accessible Journeys (% 800-

Following the Rainbow: Resources 
for Gay and Lesbian Travelers
If you’re gay or lesbian, how comfortable will you feel in The Bahamas?
The official word is that everyone is welcome, but the reality is some-
what different, depending on where you go and what you do when you
get there.
Homosexuality isn’t necessarily illegal, but gay sex acts performed in
public can carry a jail sentence of up to 20 years. This law is rarely
enforced any more, but as long as it remains on the books, you have to
exercise extreme caution.
In The Bahamas, many residents are uncomfortable with public displays
of affection between same-sex couples. In fact, “Don’t ask, don’t tell”
reigns. Therefore, if you can’t imagine a vacation that doesn’t include
strolling down the beach hand-in-hand with your main squeeze, The
Bahamas may not be for you. Head for Key West or South Miami Beach,
which will welcome you with open arms.
Nevertheless, The Bahamas can be a great vacation choice if you’re dis-
creet in public about your sexuality. On the most popular islands (New
Providence, Paradise Island, and Grand Bahama), not only can you get
lost in the crowds, but you’re more likely to run into other gay vacationers
and residents. Quietly ask around, and folks can direct you to other small
hangouts, some of which are open only every other weekend.
The International Gay & Lesbian Travel Association (IGLTA; % 800-
448-8550 or 954-776-2626; www.iglta.com) is the trade association for
the gay and lesbian travel industry and offers an online directory of gay-
and lesbian-friendly travel businesses; go to its Web site and click on
“Members.”
Chapter 8: Catering to Special Travel Needs and Interests 107

Many agencies offer tours and travel itineraries specifically for gay and
lesbian travelers. Among them are Above and Beyond Tours (% 800-397-
2681; www.abovebeyondtours.com), Now, Voyager (% 800-255-6951;
www.nowvoyager.com), and Olivia Cruises & Resorts (% 800-631-6277
or 510-655-0364; www.olivia.com).
Gay.com Travel (% 800-929-2268 or 415-644-8044; www.gay.com/
travel or www.outandabout.com) is an excellent online successor to
the popular Out & About print magazine. It provides regularly updated
information about gay-owned, gay-oriented, and gay-friendly lodging,
dining, sightseeing, nightlife, and shopping establishments in every
important destination worldwide.
The following travel guides are available at many bookstores, or you can
order them from any online bookseller: Spartacus International Gay
Guide (Bruno Gmünder Verlag; www.spartacusworld.com/gayguide)
and Odysseus, both good, annual English-language guidebooks focused
on gay men; and the Damron guides (www.damron.com), with separate,
annual books for gay men and lesbians.
Planning the Perfect Getaway: 
Tips for Honeymooners
The Bahamas offer so many different types of hotels and resorts that
you’re certain to find just the right honeymoon retreat to jump-start
your new lives together. Of course, you don’t have to be hitched to
indulge in these hideaways.
All-inclusive resorts — where one price covers your room, meals, 
beverages, entertainment, most activities, tips, taxes, and airfare — are
popular among newlyweds. To stay busy day and night, you need never
leave these self-contained vacation playgrounds until you have to go
home. Check out Chapter 11 for the descriptions of elegant, couples-only
Sandals Royal Bahamian and the more moderately priced Breezes;
both resorts are located on New Providence. On Grand Bahama, think
about Viva Wyndham Fortuna Beach (see Chapter 15). On San Salvador,
consider Club Med–Columbus Isle (see Chapter 25).
If you don’t necessarily want an all-inclusive resort but you want a bliz-
zard of action, check into Atlantis Paradise Island Resort & Casino
(see Chapter 11) off New Providence. You can also find plenty to see and
do in and around the Westin and Sheraton at Our Lucaya on Grand
Bahama (see Chapter 15).
Some couples prefer quieter, more remote resorts, where the sun, the
sand, and each other’s company are the main draws. If you prefer this
Part II: Planning Your Trip to The Bahamas 
108

scenario, the elegant One&Only Ocean Club is an excellent honeymoon
haunt on New Providence (see Chapter 11). Small is beautiful at cozy
resorts like Green Turtle Club and Bluff House on Green Turtle Cay in
the Abacos (see Chapter 20), as well as Pink Sands and Runaway Hill
Club on Harbour Island (see Chapter 22).
Quite a few accommodations, particularly the larger ones, feature honey-
moon packages. These packages aren’t usually money-savers, but they
do include special extras, such as a corner room, king-size bed, cham-
pagne, maybe a first-rate meal or two, and transportation in limousines
between your hotel and the airport. Each hotel boasts a somewhat differ-
ent set of perks, so when you make your reservation, you have to ask
exactly what your package includes.
Saying “I Do” Bahamian Style
The Bahamas are popular honeymoon destinations for just-married
spouses, but plenty of couples save the wedding for the island as well.
Romantic settings, ranging from the beach at sunset to a harborside
gazebo to a poolside patio or an elegant yacht, make tying the knot here
tempting. With colorful coral and tropical fish as a backdrop, couples
have even signaled “I do” underwater while decked out in scuba gear.
Many of the larger hotels (and some of the smaller ones, too) provide a
wedding coordinator to help you secure all your paperwork, find an offi-
cial to perform the ceremony, and hire photographers — both still and
video — and the florist. Coordinators also organize the reception and
make any other arrangements that you need.
Reviewing the marriage requirements in The Bahamas
You and your intended must both be in The Bahamas for at least 24 hours
before you can apply for a marriage license. You can fill out applications
Monday through Friday.
For details, contact the office of the Registrar General (% 242-322-3316
in Nassau or % 242-352-4934 on Grand Bahama). If you plan to marry in
one of the Out Islands, call the Bahamas Out Islands Promotions Board
(% 800-688-4752).
If you and your partner are U.S. citizens, you need to get an affidavit to
confirm this — and the fact that you’re both single — from the American
Embassy in Nassau. Note: The U.S. Embassy is closed on both American
and Bahamian holidays. You must present proof of identity, such as a
passport and, if necessary, proof of divorce. You don’t need to take any
blood tests, however. The Weddings and Honeymoon Unit of The
Bahamas Ministry of Tourism (call % 888-687-8425 or 242-302-2000 for
a brochure) can also provide you with information.
Chapter 8: Catering to Special Travel Needs and Interests 109

For assistance with planning your nuptials in The Bahamas, call your
hotel or one of the following tourist offices:
 Nassau, New Providence (% 242-302-2000)

Working out the wedding costs
An island wedding in a stunning setting can cost thousands of dollars
less than a traditional wedding at home. Table 8-1 gives you a general
idea of how much money you can expect to spend on the ceremony:

Traveling Solo
You don’t need kids or a partner to have a great vacation on these
islands, especially in Nassau or Freeport/Lucaya. Plenty of couples stay
at the smaller, quieter hotels on these islands, so you don’t have nearly
as many opportunities to meet other single visitors as you may at larger
accommodations. However, you can find groups of unattached friends
vacationing together. Because hotels in the Out Islands are so much
smaller and more intimate than on the busier islands, meeting people in
these locations is easier.
If you’re shy, join a snorkeling sail, a scuba trip, or an excursion to an
uninhabited island for a beach picnic. Before you can say “Goombay
Smash,” you’ll be chatting with new friends.
On the downside, you pay more for a hotel room or an air/hotel package
if you go it alone than if you travel with a friend because single rates are
higher than double rates divided by two. But the good news is that you
can find many affordable hotels on New Providence (particularly in
downtown Nassau and some on Cable Beach), so you shouldn’t have
trouble finding a place that suits your wallet.
Club Med–Columbus Isle (see Chapter 25) on San Salvador attracts
plenty of singles. This all-inclusive beach resort offers many diversions
designed to get people together. In addition, this place is perfect for two
single friends who travel together but like their privacy. (The hotel
offers single rooms joined by a shared bathroom.)
If you’re a socially minded single, Nassau is a good choice — you can be
as busy or as lazy as you want. Breezes, a moderately priced all-inclusive
resort on Cable Beach (see Chapter 11), is a popular choice because it
offers a medley of group activities.
During March and April, droves of U.S. college students on spring break
descend on New Providence. So if you’ve outgrown toga parties and
drinking contests, you may want to skip this scene.

B
efore you can start wiggling your toes in the sand, you need to
handle a few details. In this chapter, we deal with all the nitty-gritty
details of your travel plans, such as insurance and car rentals.
Preparing for Arrival and Departure
If you’re a U.S., Canadian, or British citizen, you don’t need a passport to
enter The Bahamas, as long as you have two other acceptable forms of
identification. However, a passport is required to get back into the
United States and Canada. If you don’t have a passport, you must take
the following papers with you:
 A certified or original copy of your birth certificate (it must have a
raised seal)
 An official photo ID, such as a valid driver’s license
 A return or ongoing airplane ticket
Getting a Passport
A valid passport is the only legal form of identification accepted around
the world. Getting a passport is easy, but the process takes some time.
For an up-to-date country-by-country listing of passport requirements,
go to the “Foreign Entry Requirement” Web page of the U.S. State
Department at www.travel.state.gov.

Applying for a U.S. passport
If you’re applying for a first-time passport, follow these steps:
1. Complete a passport application in person at a U.S. passport
office (a federal, state, or probate court or a major post office).
To find your regional passport office, either check the U.S. State
Department Web site, www.travel.state.gov, or call the
National Passport Information Center (% 877-487-2778) for 
automated information.
2. Present a certified birth certificate as proof of citizenship.
Bringing along your driver’s license, state or military ID, or social
security card is also a good idea.
3. Submit two identical passport-sized photos, measuring 2 inches
by 2 inches in size. You often find businesses that take these
photos near a passport office. Note: You can’t use a strip from a
photo-vending machine because the pictures aren’t identical.
4. Pay a fee. For people 16 and over, a passport is valid for ten years
and costs $97. For those 15 and under, a passport is valid for five
years and costs $82.
When applying for a passport, allow plenty of time before your trip; pro-
cessing normally takes three weeks but can take longer during busy 
periods (especially spring).
If your passport is in your current name and was issued within the past
15 years (and you were over age 16 when it was issued), you can renew
your passport by mail for $67. Whether you’re applying in person or
by mail, you can download passport applications from the U.S. State
Department Web site at www.travel.state.gov. For general informa-
tion, call the National Passport Agency (% 202-647-0518).
Chapter 9: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 113
New passport requirements
During the lifetime of this book, a change in Homeland Security regulations will require
Americans returning from The Bahamas to show passports when reentering the
United States. At press time, the new rules were set to go into effect on January 8,
2007. Visit http://travel.state.gov for more information.
When you enter the country, you receive an Immigration Arrival/Departure Card to fill
out and sign. Do this paperwork before it’s your turn with the Customs official. Be sure
to keep your carbon copy in a safe place because an official will collect it when you
leave The Bahamas.
Save enough cash for the departure tax that you have to pay when you exit the coun-
try. The tax is $15 from New Providence or any Out Island and $18 from Grand Bahama.

Applying for other passports
If you’re a citizen of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, or the United
Kingdom, the following lists information on applying for a passport:
 Australians can visit a local post office or passport office, call
the Australia Passport Information Service (% 131-232 toll-free
from Australia), or log on to www.passports.gov.au for details on
how and where to apply.
 Canadians can pick up applications at passport offices throughout
Canada, at post offices, or from the central Passport Office,
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade,
Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0G3 (% 800-567-6868; www.ppt.gc.ca).
You must send two identical passport-sized photos and proof
of Canadian citizenship along with your application. Processing
takes five to ten days if you apply in person or about three weeks
by mail.
 New Zealanders can pick up a passport application at any New
Zealand Passports Office or download it from the office’s Web
site (www.passports.govt.nz). Contact the Passports Office at
% 0800-225-050 in New Zealand or 04-474-8100.
 United Kingdom residents can pick up applications for a standard
ten-year passport (five-year passport for children under 16) at pass-
port offices, major post offices, or a travel agency. For information,
contact the United Kingdom Passport Service (% 0870-521-0410;
www.ukpa.gov.uk).

Traveling with minors
It’s always wise to have plenty of documentation when traveling in today’s world with
children. For changing details on entry requirements for children traveling abroad, keep
up-to-date by going to the U.S. State Department Web site: www.travel.state.gov/
foreignentryreqs.html.
To prevent international child abduction, governments have initiated procedures at entry
and exit points. These often (but not always) include requiring documentary evidence of
relationship and permission for the child’s travel from the parent or legal guardian not
present. All children must have their own passport. To get a passport, the child must be
present — that is, in person — at the center issuing the passport. If both parents are
not present, a notarized statement from the parents is required.
All questions parents or guardians may have can be answered by calling the National
Passport Information Center at % 877-487-6868 Monday to Friday 8am to 8pm eastern
standard time.

Renting a Car — or Not
Whether or not you need a car depends on which island you’re visiting.
Many visitors to New Providence, Paradise Island, Freeport/Lucaya, or
one of the Out Islands don’t bother renting a car. Here are four reasons
why you may not want to rent a car, either:
 You don’t truly need it. In New Providence/Paradise Island, a car is
more of a burden than a help. Driving around congested Nassau is
difficult, parking is limited, and you can walk to most attractions
and shops. If you’re on Cable Beach, taking a few limited taxi rides
is probably cheaper in the long run than renting a car. Grand Bahama
Island is spread out, and most locals need a car to get around.
But most places of interest are centered around Freeport/Lucaya,
which you can easily traverse with public transportation or taxi.
You can also easily explore the vast part of Grand Bahama Island on
an organized day tour (far cheaper than renting a car). On Harbour
Island you don’t need a car, but on “mainland” Eleuthera you may
want to rent a car for a day just to tour the entire length of the island.
 Driving is on the left. If you’re unfamiliar with this form of driving,
you’re more likely to have an accident.
 Reservations may not be honored. Unless you deal with a major
car-rental company, you may arrive on an island and find that the
car you reserved was rented to someone else. Many car-rental
entrepreneurs figure that a “bird in hand is better than one in the
bush,” as one staff member recently told us at Marsh Harbour.
Angry potential motorists at car-rental desks is a common sight in
The Bahamas, especially during the overbooked winter months.
 Insurance hassles and accidents. On Grand Bahama Island and on
New Providence Island, you can deal with the big U.S.-based chains,
such as Hertz and Avis. If you have an accident, you may have the
same problems with insurance companies that you encounter in
the U.S.
But driving around in the Out Islands and dealing with relatively
unknown car-rental companies or parties could lead to anything.
Settling claims may be extremely difficult, especially if you’re at
fault for causing property damage or bodily injury. You may not
want to take these risks because you can rent a taxi for a day tour
on every island. Or, for example, if you’re in George Town in the
Exumas, you can often walk to where you want to go.
Getting the best deal
If you decide to rent a car, be aware that car-rental rates vary even more
than airline fares. The price for a rental car depends on the size of the
car, the length of time that you keep it, where and when you pick it up
Chapter 9: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 115

and drop it off, where you take it, and a host of other factors. Asking a
few key questions may save you hundreds of dollars:
 Weekend rates may be lower than weekday rates. If you’re keeping
the car five or more days, a weekly rate may be cheaper than the
daily rate. Ask whether the rate is the same for pickup Friday morn-
ing as it is Thursday night.
 Check whether the rate is cheaper if you pick up the car at a loca-
tion in town rather than at the airport.
 Ask whether age is an issue. Many car-rental companies add on a fee
for drivers under 25, and some companies don’t rent to them at all.
 If you see an advertised price, be sure to ask for that specific rate;
otherwise the company may charge you the standard (higher) rate.
Don’t forget to mention membership in AAA, AARP, professional
organizations, and trade unions. These memberships usually entitle
you to discounts ranging from 5 percent to 30 percent.
 Check your frequent-flier accounts. Not only are your favorite (or, at
least, most-used) airlines likely to have sent you discount coupons,
but also most car rentals add at least 500 miles to your account.
 As with other aspects of planning your trip, using the Internet can
make comparison shopping for a car rental much easier. You can
check rates at most of the major agencies’ Web sites. Plus, all the
major travel sites — Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), Expedia
(www.expedia.com), Orbitz (www.orbitz.com), and Smarter
Travel (www.smartertravel.com), for example — have search
engines that can dig up discounted car-rental rates. Just enter the
car size you want, the pickup and return dates, and location, and
the server returns a price. You can even make the car reservation
through any of these sites.
Adding up the charges
In addition to the standard rental prices, other optional charges apply
to most car rentals (and some not-so-optional charges, such as taxes).
Many credit card companies cover the Collision Damage Waiver (CDW),
which requires you to pay for damage to the car in a collision. Check
with your credit card company before you leave so you can avoid paying
this hefty fee (as much as $20–$25 a day).
The car-rental companies also offer additional liability insurance (if you
harm others in an accident), personal accident insurance (if you harm
yourself or your passengers), and personal effects insurance (if someone
steals your luggage from your car). Your insurance policy on your car at
home probably covers most of these unlikely occurrences. However, if
your own insurance doesn’t cover you for rentals or if you don’t have
auto insurance, definitely consider the additional coverage (ask your
car-rental agent for more information). Driving around without liability
or personal accident coverage is never a good idea. Even if you’re a good
driver, other people may not be, and liability claims can be complicated.

Playing It Safe with Travel 
and Medical Insurance
Three kinds of travel insurance are available: trip-cancellation insurance,
medical insurance, and lost luggage insurance. The cost of travel insur-
ance varies widely, depending on the cost and length of your trip, your
age and health, and the type of trip you’re taking. You can get estimates
from various providers through InsureMyTrip.com. Enter your trip
cost and dates, your age, and other information, for prices from more
than a dozen companies. Here is our advice on all three types of travel
insurance.
 Trip-cancellation insurance: This type of insurance helps you get
your money back if you have to back out of a trip, if you must go
home early, or if your travel supplier goes bankrupt. The allowed
reasons for cancellation range from sickness to natural disasters to
the State Department declaring your destination unsafe for travel.
A good resource is “Travel Guard Alerts,” which is a list of travel-
related companies that Travel Guard International (www.travel
insured.com) considers high-risk. You can protect yourself further
by paying for the insurance with a credit card; by law, consumers
can get your money back on goods and services you don’t receive
if you report the loss within 60 days after the charge is listed on
your credit card statement.
 Travel medical insurance: For travel overseas, most health plans
(including Medicare and Medicaid) do not provide coverage, and
the ones that do often require you to pay for services upfront and
reimburse you only after you return home. As a safety net, you may
want to buy travel medical insurance, particularly if you’re travel-
ing to a remote or high-risk area where emergency evacuation is a
possible scenario. If you require additional medical insurance, try
MEDEX Assistance (% 410-453-6300; www.medexassist.com) or
Travel Assistance International (% 800-821-2828; www.travel
assistance.com); for general information on services, call the
company’s Worldwide Assistance Services, Inc., at % 800-777-8710.
 Lost luggage insurance: Most travelers don’t need this insurance.
Your homeowner’s or renter’s insurance should cover stolen lug-
gage if you have off-premises theft coverage. Check your existing
policies before you buy any additional coverage.
If you lose your luggage, immediately file a lost-luggage claim at 
the airport, detailing the luggage contents. On international flights
(including U.S. portions of international trips), airline baggage cover-
age is limited to approximately $9.07 per pound, up to approximately
$635 per checked bag. For most airlines, you must report delayed,
damaged, or lost baggage within four hours of arrival. The airlines
are required to deliver luggage, once found, directly to your house
or destination free of charge.
Chapter 9: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 117

You can get additional baggage insurance as part of your compre-
hensive travel-insurance package. Don’t buy insurance at the 
airport; it’s usually overpriced. Be sure to take any valuables or
irreplaceable items with you in your carry-on luggage, because
many valuables (including books, money, and electronics) aren’t
covered by airline policies.
For more information, contact one of the following recommended
insurers: Access America (% 866-807-3982; www.accessamerica.
com); Travel Guard International (% 800-826-4919; www.travel
guard.com); Travel Insured International (% 800-243-3174;
www.travelinsured.com); and Travelex Insurance Services
(% 888-457-4602; www.travelex-insurance.com).
Staying Healthy When You Travel
You can get over-the-counter medications — aspirin, cold remedies,
antacids, and so on — at pharmacies and hotels on New Providence and
Grand Bahama and in many hotels on other islands. If you need to refill
a prescription, bring the generic name of your medication because local
pharmacists may know only the generic name. Most hotel shops and phar-
macies aren’t open at night, so travel with any basics that you may need,
such as medicine for diarrhea or upset stomach, sunburn remedies, anti-
itch cream to soothe insect bites, and children’s aspirin if you’re traveling
with little ones. Don’t forget any prescription drugs that you’re taking, and
if you think that you may run out, plan ahead to refill your prescription. If
you wear contact lenses, pack an extra pair in the event that you lose one.
Before you go
If you have a serious or chronic illness, talk to your doctor before you
leave. If you have a condition such as epilepsy, diabetes, or heart prob-
lems, wear a MedicAlert identification tag (% 888-633-4298; www.
medicalert.org), which immediately alerts doctors to your condition
and gives them access to your records through MedicAlert’s 24-hour
hot line. Contact the International Association for Medical Assistance
to Travelers (IAMAT; % 716-754-4883 or, in Canada, 416-652-0137;
www.iamat.org) for tips on travel and health concerns and lists of local
English-speaking doctors. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (% 877-394-8747; www.cdc.gov) provides up-to-date infor-
mation on health hazards by region or country and offers tips on food
safety. The Web site www.tripprep.com, sponsored by a consortium of
travel medicine practitioners, may also offer helpful advice on traveling
abroad. You can find listings of reliable clinics overseas at the
International Society of Travel Medicine (www.istm.org).
Emergencies and medical care
If you get sick, ask a staff member at your hotel to recommend a local
doctor — even his own doctor, if necessary. If you can’t find a doctor to
Part II: Planning Your Trip to The Bahamas 
118

help you right away, try the emergency room at the local hospital or
clinic. Many hospital emergency rooms have walk-in clinics for cases
that aren’t life-threatening. You may not get immediate attention, but
you won’t pay the high price of an emergency-room visit.
If you have health insurance, carry your insurance card in your wallet,
but you may have to pay all medical costs upfront and be reimbursed for
them later. For information on purchasing additional medical insurance
for your trip, see the previous section.
Addressing other potential hazards
Here are some ways you can prevent common vacation disasters:
 Drinking the water: Drinking water from the tap is safe, but you
may not like the unfamiliar taste. Many hotels supply bottled or 
filtered water for guests. Before you take a swig from a bottle,
though, check whether the hotel gives you the water free. Some
resorts charge $5 or more per bottle. Stocking up on bottled water
at a nearby drugstore or grocery store is always cheaper than
buying it at your hotel or taking it from your minibar.
 Sunbathing: As all visitors to the islands know, you can get a
wicked sunburn even on hazy days if you don’t wear sunscreen.
Reapply sunscreen every time you come out of the water, even if
your sunscreen is waterproof. Reapply the cream periodically
throughout the day, whether you go into the water or not. If you get
your hair cornrowed and you’re not used to wearing it that way,
put some sunscreen on the delicate skin of your newly exposed
scalp. Wide-brimmed hats also come in handy, of course.
 Repelling bugs: Use insect repellent, particularly at dusk, when the
mosquitoes and gnats are at their most treacherous.
 Taking a scuba dive: If scuba diving is part of your vacation, plan
your trip so that you don’t fly within 24 hours of diving. Your body
needs time to recover from being at a high altitude before it hits the
lower depths and vice versa.
When you’re in the water, the stunning shapes and colors of fish,
coral, and sea plants may make you want to reach out and touch.
Don’t. Not only can you destroy delicate marine life by doing so,
but you can also put yourself in danger. Even innocuous-looking
coral can be razor sharp, and a variety aptly known as fire coral can
burn your skin. Also be warned that shiny jewelry in the water can
attract barracudas and sharks.
 Keeping safe: Even though you’re relaxing on a vacation, keep up
your guard. For example, especially in Nassau, don’t venture into
unknown neighborhoods alone at night. Don’t wear flashy jewelry
or leave your valuables lying around, even in your locked hotel
room. Many larger hotels have in-room safes or front-desk safety
deposit boxes.

Staying Connected by Cellphone or E-mail
Travelers have a number of ways to stay in touch while on the road. Of
course, using your own laptop, personal digital assistant (PDA), or cell-
phone gives you the most flexibility. But even if you don’t own these
devices or prefer not to travel with them, you can stay connected.
Accessing the Internet away from home
Although most cities have cybercafes, you’ll only find a few in The
Bahamas. Check www.cybercafe.com for locations. Otherwise, you
may be at the mercy of your hotel’s facilities — but beware of exorbitant
rates.
To retrieve your e-mail, find out whether your Internet Service Provider
(ISP) has a Web-based interface tied to your existing e-mail account. 
If it does, follow its instructions for accessing your e-mail. If your ISP
doesn’t have such an interface, you can use the free mail2web service
(www.mail2web.com) to view and reply to your home e-mail.
If you need to access files on your office computer, look into a service
called GoToMyPC (www.gotomypc.com). The service provides a Web-
based interface so you can access and manipulate a distant PC from 
anywhere — even a cybercafe — provided your “target” PC is on and
has an always-on connection to the Internet (such as RoadRunner cable
access).
If you’re bringing your own computer, check your ISP’s Web site or call
its toll-free number and ask how you can use your current account away
from home via a local access number; also ask how much it will cost.
If you’re traveling outside your ISP’s reach, the iPass network has dial-up
numbers in most of the world’s countries. You have to sign up with
an iPass provider, who then tells you how to set up your computer for
The Bahamas. For a list of iPass providers, go to www.ipass.com and
click on “Individuals.” One solid provider is i2roam (% 866-811-6209 or
920-235-0475; www.i2roam.com). Wherever you go, bring a connection
kit with the right power and phone adapters, a spare phone cord, and a
spare Ethernet network cable.
Most business-class hotels offer dataports for laptop modems, and some
hotels in The Bahamas offer high-speed Internet access using an Ethernet
network cable. You have to bring your own cables either way, so call
your hotel in advance to find out what your options are.
Using a cellphone
The three letters that define much of the world’s wireless capabilities
are GSM (Global System for Mobiles), a big, seamless network that
makes for easy cross-border cellphone use throughout Europe and
Part II: Planning Your Trip to The Bahamas 
120

dozens of other countries worldwide. In the U.S., T-Mobile, AT&T
Wireless, and Cingular use this quasi-universal system; in Canada,
Microcell and some Rogers customers are GSM, and all Europeans and
most Australians use GSM. 
If your cellphone is on a GSM system, and you have a world-capable
multiband phone such as many Sony Ericsson, Motorola, or Samsung
models, you can make and receive calls across civilized areas on much
of the globe, from Andorra to Uganda. Just call your wireless operator
and ask for “international roaming” to be activated on your account.
Unfortunately, per-minute charges can be high — usually $1 to $1.50 in
Western Europe and up to $5 in places like Russia and Indonesia.
For many, renting a phone is a good idea. (Even worldphone owners will
have to rent new phones if they’re traveling to non-GSM regions, such as
Japan or Korea.) While you can rent a phone from any number of overseas
sites, including kiosks at airports and at car-rental agencies, we suggest
you rent the phone before you leave home. North Americans can rent
one before leaving home from InTouch USA (% 800-872-7626; www.
intouchglobal.com) or RoadPost (% 888-290-1606 or 905-272-5665;
www.roadpost.com). InTouch will also, for free, advise you on whether
your existing phone will work overseas; simply call % 703-222-7161
between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. EST, or go to www.intouchglobal.com/
travel.htm.
Buying a phone can be economically attractive, as many nations have
cheap prepaid phone systems. Once you arrive at your destination, stop
by a local cellphone shop and get the cheapest package; you’ll probably
pay less than $100 for a phone and a starter calling card. Local calls
may be as low as 10¢ per minute, and in many countries incoming calls
are free.
Keeping Up With Airline Security Measures
With the federalization of airport security, security procedures at U.S.
airports are more stable and consistent than ever. Generally, you’ll
be fine if you arrive at the airport two hours before a flight to The
Bahamas.
Bring a current passport. Keep your ID at the ready to show at check-in,
the security checkpoint, and sometimes even the gate. 
E-tickets have made paper tickets nearly obsolete. Passengers with 
E-tickets can beat the ticket-counter lines by using airport electronic
kiosks or even online check-in from your home computer. Online check-in
involves logging on to your airline’s Web site, accessing your reservation,
and printing out your boarding pass — and the airline may even offer
you bonus miles to do so!
Chapter 9: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 121

If you’re using a kiosk at the airport to check in, bring the credit card
you used to book the ticket or your frequent-flier card. Print out your
boarding pass from the kiosk and simply proceed to the security check-
point with your pass and a photo ID. If you’re checking bags or looking
to snag an exit-row seat, you’re able to do so using most airline kiosks.
Even the smaller airlines employ the kiosk system, but always call your
airline to make sure these alternatives are available. Curbside check-in
is also a good way to avoid lines, although a few airlines still ban curb-
side check-in; call before you go.
Security lines are getting shorter, but long ones still remain. If you have
trouble standing for long periods of time, tell an airline employee; the
airline can provide a wheelchair. You can speed up security by not 
wearing metal objects, such as big belt buckles or clanky earrings.
If you have metallic body parts, a note from your doctor can prevent a
long chat with the security screeners. Keep in mind that only ticketed
passengers are allowed past security, except for folks escorting passen-
gers with disabilities or children.
Federalization has stabilized what you can carry on and what you can’t.
Travelers in the U.S. are allowed one carry-on bag, plus a “personal item”
such as a purse, briefcase, or laptop bag. Carry-on hoarders can stuff all
sorts of things into a laptop bag; as long as it has a laptop in it, it’s still
considered a personal item. The Transportation Security Administration
(TSA) has issued a list of restricted items; check its Web site (www.tsa.
gov) for details.
Airport screeners may decide that your checked luggage needs to 
be searched by hand. You can now purchase luggage locks that allow
screeners to open and re-lock a checked bag if hand-searching is neces-
sary. Look for Travel Sentry certified locks at luggage or travel shops
and Brookstone stores (you can buy them online at www.brookstone.
com). For more information on the locks, visit www.travelsentry.org.

Chapter 10
Settling into New
Providence
In This Chapter
 Knowing what to expect when you get here
 Getting around New Providence
 Discovering all New Providence has to offer
M
ost of The Bahamas is about escapism. Not New Providence
Island — it’s where the action is. This is the bustling hub of The
Bahamas and the country’s major tourist attraction. Expect elegant bars,
gargantuan gambling parlors, dance clubs, the best restaurants, sprawl-
ing resorts, and blocks and blocks of shops with discounted merchan-
dise. The island’s a bit of a circus, but that’s what many vacationers are
seeking.
Paradise Island is sleeker and more upscale than Cable Beach, even
though it’s overbuilt and overly commercialized. Most visitors opt 
for the beachfront properties and visit Nassau only for its shops and
attractions.
Arriving at the Airport
When Bahamians come to the end of a journey, they say, “Ya reach.” 
You receive a special New Providence welcome as “ya reach” Nassau
International Airport (% 242-377-1759). Spirited live calypso or
Bahamian Junkanoo music greets you in the arrivals’ hall. The beat of
the music will have your shoulders bouncing and your feet tapping.
The airport is hassle-free. From collecting your bags and passing
through Customs to finding the taxi or van that will take you to your
hotel, everything runs quickly and smoothly. You can find the ATMs at
the airport in the arrivals hall, and you also find a Tourist Information
Booth (% 242-377-6806), open daily from 8:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. The
booth’s staff dispenses vacation brochures and free maps.

Navigating your way through 
passport control and Customs
Start filling out your Immigration Arrival/Departure Card as soon as you
join one of the lines marked “Visitors.” This way, you’re ready to roll
when it’s your turn to present the card along with your passport or birth
certificate, photo ID, and your return- or onward-bound airline ticket.
Remember where you stick your copy of the immigration card because
you need to show it before you leave the country.
Getting through Customs usually takes about 15 minutes, depending on
how many different pieces of luggage you have. Even if you declare that
you’re not bringing in anything illegal, Customs may single you out for a
more thorough search.
Getting from the airport to your hotel
Cable Beach, the main resort area on New Providence, is about a 15-
minute drive from the airport. Paradise Island, joined to New Providence
by bridge, is 30 minutes away. If your hotel package includes transporta-
tion, you receive a coupon or voucher to use upon arrival. When you
find the right bus going to your hotel, show the driver the voucher.
Buses are labeled and easy to find. Otherwise, you have to take a taxi,
which costs about $22 for two passengers to Cable Beach or about $27
to Paradise Island.
To save money, you can share a cab with another couple heading to the
same hotel and pay $3 for each additional person — but pretend that
you’ve known each other since kindergarten. If you reveal that you just
met at the airport, the driver may try to charge each couple the full rate.
Drivers expect, and sometimes request, a 15 percent tip.
In most cases, you can get around New Providence without a car. If you
decide that you need wheels, you can pick up your car at the airport if
you rented through a major agency. Try to make your car-rental reserva-
tion before leaving home. For more information, see the section “Getting
Around New Providence” later in this chapter.
Cruising into New Providence
Sometimes nearly a dozen cruise ships are in port at one time at Prince
George Dock, also known as Prince George Wharf. If you’re among the
passengers, your ship is as much of an attraction as its destination,
meaning that you don’t have a whole lot of time for exploring dry land.
However, because you disembark near Rawson Square in the heart of
Nassau, you’re just a stroll away from the Straw Market and all the
shops and restaurants of Bay Street, the main avenue. Read more about
these attractions in Chapter 13.
Part III: New Providence 
126

A jitney, or public bus, takes you to the sandy shores of Cable Beach or
to the foot of the Paradise Island bridge. You can walk across the bridge
(and pay the 25¢ toll) to Paradise Beach, the most popular beach on
Paradise Island. Of course, taxis can take you from downtown Nassau
across the bridge (for a $2 toll), but the most convenient way for cruise-
ship passengers to get to Paradise Island is to take one of the ferries
from Prince George Dock for $1 each way.
Choosing Your Location
The capital city of Nassau dominates New Providence Island. Most of
the beach resorts are at Cable Beach, a ten-minute drive west of Nassau.
Paradise Island, which is connected by bridge to Nassau, is also packed
with beachfront hotels.
Nassau, where Bahamians live and work, and the resort areas of Cable
Beach and Paradise Island have distinct personalities. A hotel in down-
town Nassau can put you on or across from a beach; it can also place
you within walking distance of a slew of restaurants, the Straw Market,
duty-free shops, horse-and-buggy rides, and historic sites. However,
Nassau isn’t a safe place to be at night. For many visitors, life on scenic
Cable Beach revolves around the casinos, while the draw for others is
the long stretch of golden sand. Paradise Island is short on historic
attractions but long on water fun, designer shops, nightlife, and first-rate
(but expensive) cuisine.
If you want to stay on the beach but not cause serious damage to your
wallet, look for choices on Cable Beach and Nassau. On Paradise Island,
the best hotels — whether on or off the beach — are more expensive.
The casino in Cable Beach sits between the Wyndham Nassau Resort
and the Radisson. On Paradise Island, the casino is located at the
Atlantis Resort. Shuttle buses take you to these gambling meccas if you
choose to stay at one of the other hotels.
You can easily reach other attractions, such as museums, old forts, and
the Ardastra Gardens & Zoo (see Chapter 13) from Cable Beach, down-
town Nassau, or Paradise Island. To get to these points of interest, you
can take a taxi, guided tour, public bus, or go on foot. You can also make
arrangements through your hotel to sail to one of the beach-rimmed off-
shore islets that offers aquatic activities, including dolphin and stingray
encounters. Some of these side trips are popular among cruise-ship pas-
sengers, so depending on when you go, these uninhabited islands may
host large crowds.
Chapter 10: Settling into New Providence 127

Getting Around New Providence
Two parallel bridges — with traffic flowing in opposite directions — link
Nassau and Paradise Island. The older bridge — the only bridge for
decades before the most spectacular section of the multimillion-dollar
Atlantis resort sprouted on Paradise Island in the late 1990s — goes
from Paradise Island to Nassau.
The bridge to Paradise Island is about a mile from the center of down-
town Nassau. You can walk the whole distance, take a jitney to the foot
of the bridge and walk across, or take a taxi from Nassau all the way
across. Every time you cross the bridge from Nassau to Paradise Island,
you must pay a toll: $2 by taxi or $1 by car. There is no charge for 
pedestrians.
Here are more tips about the various modes of transportation in New
Providence.
Exploring on foot
Historic downtown Nassau is suitable for walking but is congested
between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. on weekdays. (For details on what sights you
can expect to see, check out Chapter 13.)
The city’s streets are desolate after dark, so lone strolls at night aren’t
safe. If you like wandering under the stars, Cable Beach and Paradise
Island are your best bets.
Taking a bus
Some hotels along Cable Beach and on Paradise Island offer guests free
bus service within the resort areas. To go elsewhere, you can take taxis
or rent a car and brave Nassau traffic. Or, you can get almost anywhere
you want to go on New Providence on a jitney. These small buses or
large vans travel up and down West Bay Street (the road in front of Cable
Beach hotels) to beaches, through downtown Nassau, and to other parts
of the island. They run from approximately 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. At $1 a ride,
they’re a convenient, inexpensive way to get around. You need exact
change or a $1 bill. When you see a jitney coming, flag it down. The
buses wait to fill up at depots and are often tightly packed, but with
reggae or calypso pumping on the radio, the mood is always festive.
To go east from downtown Nassau toward the Paradise Island bridges,
catch a bus at Frederick and Bay streets, near the Straw Market. These
buses don’t go over the bridge, so you have to walk or take a cab across.
To go west toward Cable Beach, catch a bus near the British Colonial
Part III: New Providence 
128

Hilton at Bay Street. If you’re traveling from Cable Beach to Paradise
Island or vice versa, you must change buses in town.
Taking a taxi
Taxis wait outside Cable Beach and Paradise Island hotels, and they’re
also plentiful in downtown Nassau. Drivers take the same routes so often
that many don’t bother to use their meters. Therefore, before you hop
into a cab, ask your hotel staff the approximate fare to wherever you’re
going. From Cable Beach to downtown Nassau, you pay about $10 for
two passengers. The trip from Cable Beach to Paradise Island costs
about $16.
Driving around
If you want to rent a car, you must drive on the left side of the road, 
a holdover of British tradition. If you come from small-town America,
drivers in Nassau may appear reckless to you. You can make car-rental
arrangements at the airport or through your hotel (see Chapter 9 for
more information).
Ferrying from island to island
Ferries run between Prince George Dock, in downtown Nassau, and
Paradise Island about every ten minutes daily from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. The
round-trip cost is $6. A ferry is the most scenic way to get from Paradise
Island to Nassau and vice versa. Go to the dock and climb aboard the
next ferry that’s leaving for a brief sail across the harbor.
Other fun ways to get around
Here are other options for getting around New Providence and Paradise
Island.
 Touring town in a horse-drawn carriage: Riding around in a horse-
drawn surrey with fringe on top is the most romantic way to see
Nassau. Your horse may even have a droopy flower stuck in his
straw hat. Carriages wait for passengers at Rawson Square, in the
heart of Nassau, not far from where the cruise ships dock. For a 
20-minute ride, expect to pay about $15 per person for up to three
adults plus one or two children.
 Riding bicycles: Because traffic is often crazy in and around
Nassau, two-wheelers aren’t the best way to get from place to
place. If you want to bike, you can do so in front of any large hotel
complex. (Ask the hotel staff for information on bike rentals.) 
A guided tour is your best bet along scenic and shoreline trails. 
Chapter 10: Settling into New Providence 129

A half-day bicycle tour with Bahamas Outdoors Ltd. (% 242-362-
1574) costs $65.
 Buzzing by on a motor scooter: Some vacationers love zipping
around on mini-motorcycles or scooters, but the often speedy
Nassau traffic makes them far from safe. If you’re feeling brave,
wear a helmet and set out on your adventure, staying on the left
side of the road. Ask your hotel staff for the closest scooter-rental
outfit. Rates run about $45 per day.

American Express
If you need help with traveler’s checks or
other American Express services, visit the
office at Destinations on Shirley Street,
between Parliament and Charlotte streets
(% 242-322-2931). It’s open Monday to
Friday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
ATMs
Major banks throughout Nassau include the
Royal Bank of Canada (% 242-322-8700),
Bank of Nova Scotia (% 242-356-1517), and
Barclays (% 242-356-8000); each has ATMs.
However, some accept cards only in the
Cirrus network (% 800-424-7787), while
others take only Plus (% 800-843-7587).
ATMs at both the Paradise Island and Cable
Beach casinos also dispense quick cash.
You can also find ATMs at the airports.
Baby Sitting
Hotel staff can help you make arrangements
to hire an experienced sitter. Expect to pay
around $10 to $15 an hour, plus $3 an hour
for each additional child.
Emergencies
For any major emergency, call % 919.
Hospitals
The government-run Princess Margaret
Hospital (% 242-322-2861) is located on
Shirley Street in downtown Nassau. Before
your trip to The Bahamas, check out
whether your health insurance covers you
while you’re abroad. If not, you may want to
purchase a traveler’s insurance plan with
emergency medical expense coverage (see
Chapter 9 for details).
Information
Contact the Ministry of Tourism at Rawson
Square (% 242-328-7810) or ask your hotel
staff for good local maps and other visitor
information.
Internet Access
Check out Cybercafe at The Mall at Marathon
(% 242-394-6254). Here you can get online
from your own laptop or log on to one of the
computers. The cost is 15¢ per minute. Some
of the larger hotels also offer guests Internet
access for a small fee.
Newspapers and Magazines
The Tribune Daily and The Nassau Guardian,
both published in the morning, are the coun-
try’s two competing daily newspapers. At
your hotel and visitor information stations,
you can find various helpful magazines,
brochures, and booklets.
Pharmacies
The Prescription Parlourx Pharmacy (% 242-
356-3973) on East Street South is open daily
from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. You can have whatever
you need delivered to your hotel for about the
cost of a round-trip taxi ride to the pharmacy.

The delivery charge is $6 from about 7 a.m.
to 9 p.m. and $25 until 11 p.m. Another reli-
able pharmacy that also delivers is Cole
Thompson, open 8:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. at Bay
and Charlotte streets (% 242-322-2062).
Police
In an emergency, call % 919.
Post Office
The main post office is at the juncture of
East Hill Street and East Street in Nassau
(% 242-322-3344).
Restrooms
Downtown Nassau has free public toilets,
which are adjacent to both the cruise ship
docks and other docks near the Straw
Market on Bay Street. But when nature
calls, most locals opt to duck into one of the
better-maintained restrooms of the many
bars or casinos scattered throughout the
city. The toilets in McDonald’s on Bay Street
are a good bet.
Safety
Just as you should anywhere in the world,
exercise caution and common sense. For
example, don’t wear flashy jewelry to the
beach or turn your back on your camera 
or handbag. Stay away from desolate or 
run-down areas — whether residential or
commercial — at night. Cable Beach and
Paradise Island are always packed with visi-
tors and are safer places for walking and
exploring after dark.
Taxis
Taxis wait outside Cable Beach and
Paradise Island hotels, and they’re also
plentiful in Nassau. Before you hop into a
cab, ask your hotel staff the approximate
fare to wherever you’re going. From Cable
Beach to downtown Nassau, you pay about
$10 for two passengers. The trip from Cable
Beach to Paradise Island costs about $16.

New Providence

 Deciding among hotel locations
 Evaluating the top hotel choices
N
ew Providence reigns supreme when it comes to the number of
resorts and activities. You can also find a bed-and-breakfast or a
small beach hotel away from the crowds.
Surveying the Scene
Most accommodations in New Providence are high-rises with hundreds
of rooms. But New Providence also offers villas, town houses, and condos.
These options have fewer services, such as restaurants or staff to help
make arrangements for tours and activities. Many villas, town houses,
and condos are a distance from sights and attractions, and you have to
provide your own transportation. Keep in mind that while you have all
the comforts of home, you also have all the work that goes along with it.
However, these types of accommodations are good for families or groups
of friends who prefer doing their own cooking and are looking for a pri-
vate vacation. For long-term vacationers, these types of accommoda-
tions are a great money-saving tactic for an extended island stay.
The rates listed in the reviews below are for two people spending one
night in a double room in winter or early spring. These charges are 
published rates available to anybody who walks in off the street and
requests a room. You can get discounted hotel rates in many ways 
(see Chapter 7 for more details). Rates at Breezes and Sandals Royal
Bahamian include meals, beverages, tips, taxes, transportation to and
from the airport, entertainment, and most activities.

If a view is important to you, make sure that you clarify this point when
you reserve a room. The most expensive rooms invariably have ocean
views; the less expensive accommodations open onto a pool or a garden.
Sometimes another building obscures views from a room. Ask so that
you aren’t unpleasantly surprised with a vista of a wall.
Most New Providence hotels don’t quote prices for a meal plan, such as
MAP (modified American plan or breakfast and dinner). When they do,
the extra cost per person is indicated.
The Best Accommodations
Here are our top hotel picks in Nassau, Cable Beach, and Paradise
Island, along with some handy maps.
Atlantis Paradise Island Resort & Casino
$$$$$
Paradise Island Beach
The Atlantis is a 2,349-room resort that sprawls from one shore of Paradise
Island to the other, opening onto a long stretch of white sandy beach. Stay
here if you’d like to lodge in a mega-resort and mini-city. Check into the
nearby One&Only Ocean Club (see the listing for this property later in the
chapter) if you’re seeking more tranquillity and exclusivity.
Dozens of restaurants, bars, lounges, designer boutiques, and a mammoth
casino that’s open day and night keep many visitors glued to the prem-
ises. The resort’s comfortable, sleekly decorated rooms vary in size, view,
and location. Although all rooms have small balconies, many of the bal-
conies in the plush Royal Towers (the priciest section) are wide enough for
only two pairs of feet. The Beach Tower is the least expensive wing, with
Coral Towers in the middle. Bathrooms are spacious and well maintained.
Room service is available round-the-clock, and you can stay busy on the
tennis, volleyball, and basketball courts; the putting green; in exercise
classes; or at the spa. However, the centerpiece of the hotel is its dazzling
water wonderworld of aquariums, freshwater pools, snorkeling lagoons,
water slides, and a white-sand beach.
Take one of the water slides down the life-size replica of a Mayan temple.
An 18m (60-ft.), nearly vertical drop zips you along a clear tunnel that
slices through a shark tank. To view the sharks at a more leisurely pace,
take the 15m (48-ft.) corkscrew slide instead. Other aquatic playgrounds
range from a shallow children’s pool and beachlike zero-entry pool
(instead of having steps, the shallow end gradually slopes from dry land,
just like a beach) to a river pool that carries you along in an inner tube, as
well as a series of pools linked by water slides. In other words, you’re at
Disney. The Atlantis’s activity-packed children’s program is not only the
best in The Bahamas but also in the Caribbean.
Twenty restaurants are on-site, so the range of prices and types of cuisine
are greater than in many small towns. You can take the kids to chow down

Breezes Bahamas
$$$$$
Cable Beach
At the eastern end of the strip of Cable Beach hotels, all-inclusive Breezes,
run by SuperClubs, is designed mainly for adult couples and singles, but
children age 14 or older are welcome, too. The other major all-inclusive,
Sandals (reviewed later in this chapter), is more stylish and upscale with
better amenities, but that Jamaican chain only accepts male/female cou-
ples, whereas Breezes is more democratically open to all.
The hotel opens onto one of the best beaches along the entire coastal
strip. You entertain yourself with everything from toga and pajama parties
to talent shows and comedy cabarets. There’s even an ice-skating rink.
Island traditions, such as dancers and musicians dressed in whimsical cos-
tumes, make lively appearances in Junkanoo Jamborees and steel-band
performances. A large, heated freshwater swimming pool is on-site. You
can also snorkel or take scuba lessons. A short walk along the road or the
beach takes you to the Crystal Palace Casino (see Chapter 13).
The refurbished hotel rooms with wooden furniture and Formica tops are
comfortable, but frankly never rise beyond the standard of a first-class
American hotel. Although the price tag sounds expensive at first, it
includes all meals, beverages, and most activities. Diners can sample good
but unremarkable international cuisine at a food court. The best bet is the
Italian dining room.

activities. AE, DISC, MC, V.
Coming attractions
During the life of this edition, Atlantis will begin a new phase of development that will
include a significant enlargement and revamping of the present layout. Individual ele-
ments will include the construction of a 600-room all-suite luxury hotel, a 400-unit
condo hotel, and additional water-themed attractions, including a dolphin encounter.
The resort will also add local branches of Bobby Flay’s Mesa Grill and Nobu, an avant-
garde Japanese restaurant spearheaded by namesake chef Nobu Matsuhisa and par-
tially funded by partner Robert De Niro. If construction and deal-making continue as
planned, both will be in place and functioning sometime in 2007.

Cable Beach Accommodations

British Colonial Hilton
$$$
Nassau
The grand dame of all Nassau hotels, this landmark seven-floor, 291-room
hotel has been fine-tuned by the Hilton chain. If you’re going to The
Bahamas for a beach vacation, check into one of the hotels at Paradise
Island or Cable Beach. If the shopping and sights of Nassau are more
important to you, consider this landmark hotel. A beach that’s adequate
for sunning and swimming is here, but it’s a bit small. The hotel doesn’t
even try to attract the casino crowd, who prefer either the Atlantis or the
Nassau Marriott. Business travelers come here, and so do visitors who are
more interested in buying than gambling.
Scenes from such 007 flicks as Thunderball and Never Say Never Again were
shot at this plush and glamorous hotel. There’s even a “Double 0” suite filled
with Bond memorabilia. The rooms open onto the small beach that’s situ-
ated on the channel separating New Providence from Paradise Beach. A dig-
nified atmosphere prevails in the bedrooms, which are a bit on the small
side, but quite comfortable. They’re capped with rich crown moldings and
accessorized with tile or stone-sheathed bathrooms, and many offer scenic
views of the Nassau harbor. The cuisine at the British Colonial is good stan-
dard fare, although it can’t compete with top Nassau restaurants (see
Chapter 12). The hotel features a medium-sized, unheated freshwater pool.
See map p. 134. 1 Bay St. % 800-HILTONS (800-445-8667) in the U.S. and Canada, or
242-322-3301. Fax: 242-302-9009. www.hilton.com. Parking: $6. Rack rates:
$205–$325 double, $435–$2,000 suite. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V.
Comfort Suites
$$$–$$$$
Paradise Island
Here you’re offered modern “suites,” but don’t expect yours to have sep-
arate rooms or even a balcony. Instead, you get one comfortable motel-
like room with sitting and sleeping areas. For families or groups of friends,
the rooms offer pull-out sofas. This hotel isn’t on the beach and you can’t
see the ocean from your bedroom, but across from your hotel is the
Atlantis Paradise Island Resort & Casino (see this resort’s entry earlier in
this chapter), which does open onto a beautiful white sandy beach with a
sheltered marina. So you’re only a five-minute walk from the sands. The
freshwater pool is small and unheated. An open-air restaurant serves only
breakfast and lunch.
The real draw of Comfort Suites is that, as a guest, you have full access to
the amenities at the Atlantis. Comfort Suites is a quieter three-story hotel
and is a good choice if you want access to Atlantis facilities without stay-
ing at the overwhelming mega-resort. For the most privacy at Comfort
Suites, ask for a room that’s not along a walkway. Children under age 16
stay free with one or two adults.

Dillet’s Guest House
$$
Nassau
This bed-and-breakfast sits in a residential neighborhood within strolling
distance of Saunders Beach, downtown Nassau, and bus stops. Iris
Knowles, who runs Dillet’s with her daughter, Danielle, was reared in this
handsome home, which was built in 1928 by her father. The inn has only
seven rooms, which are decorated with white wicker and pastels. All the
guest quarters offer sitting areas, air-conditioning, and ceiling fans. The
bathrooms are also attractive but small, each with a shower. Taking up an
entire block, the grounds — which include a small, unheated freshwater
pool — are planted with tropical greenery. You’re treated to a Bahamian
breakfast featuring sweet johnnycake and banana bread or potato bread
flavored with coconut.
See map p. 134. Dunmore Avenue and Strachan Street. % 242-325-1133. Fax:
242-325-7183. www.islandeaze.com/dillets. Rack rates: $125 double. Rate
includes breakfast. No credit cards.
Nassau Beach Hotel
$$–$$$
Cable Beach
Next door to its sibling, the flashier Wyndham Nassau Resort & Crystal
Palace Casino (reviewed later in this chapter), and across the road from
the Cable Beach Golf Course, the Nassau Beach Hotel has been going
strong since the 1940s. Claiming a prime slice of the white sand beach-
front, this hotel is one of the more dignified in the area, and has weathered
competition from the newer, glitzier resorts nearby. But don’t let the
Georgian-style architecture, gleaming marble-and-tile lobby, and hushed
hues fool you. The Nassau Beach Hotel knows how to party. Check out the
nightly Bahamian revue at the popular King & Knights club, the loud
Friday-evening Junkanoo parade at Café Johnny Canoe out front, or one of
the hotel’s various bars. When hunger hits, you can choose from seven on-
site restaurants serving standard international cuisine — except for the
Beef Cellar, which grills the juiciest, most tender, and succulent steaks on
Cable Beach.
The midsize accommodations contain summery rattan pieces, comfort-
able beds, and a marble bathroom. All rooms come with a balcony or patio,
but make sure you ask about the view when you make your reservation.
Although you can see the ocean from most rooms, some overlook build-
ings instead. Watersports are extensive, and the hotel also has six tennis
courts (four are floodlit for night play) and a fitness center. Two unheated
freshwater pools are also on-site.

Nassau Palm Resort
$$–$$$
Nassau
If you like spending your cash on purchases other than your hotel room,
this place may be for you. Just west of downtown Nassau, this hotel is
within easy reach of shops, restaurants, and historic sites of Bay Street,
the main drag. The hotel’s right across the street from the small but ade-
quate Junkanoo Beach. If you’re ready to hit a casino, head 3km (2 miles)
northeast to Paradise Island’s casino or 5km (3 miles) west to Cable
Beach’s casino.
The medium-sized bedrooms have a view of either the beach or Nassau
Harbour, and they come with extras that you don’t always find in a mod-
erately priced choice, including alarm clocks, phones with two lines, and
a desk. Bathrooms are a bit small. With diversions such as Nintendo on
hand, the kid suites on the ground floor around the swimming pool are
good for families; these rooms have a king-size bed, plus a second (small,
windowless) room with bunk beds. The hotel boasts two unheated fresh-
water pools, one small and one large. The on-site Bay Street Grille is not
The times, they are a changin’ 
for Cable Beach
Currently, Cable Beach boasts a wide variety of restaurants and sports facilities, lots
of glitz and glitter, and the biggest casino, in terms of square footage, in The Bahamas.
All of that will be changing between 2007 and 2009, when a multi-tiered redevelop-
ment program will forever change the status of Cable Beach as the “also-ran” next to
Paradise Island — though to be fair, even in its present incarnation, Cable Beach has
many loyal fans, some of whom think Paradise Island is too snobbish, too contrived,
too expensive, and too similar to a Disney-inspired theme park.
Major infrastructure changes will include a revised layout of one of New Providence
Island’s busiest traffic arteries, West Bay Street. Other plans include the dredging of
new lakes, marinas, water traps for a redesigned golf course, the destruction of some
of the older buildings within the new Cable Beach compound, and an enlargement of
the existing casino. It will also call for the construction of an entire new string of resort
hotels, all of them members of the Starwood group, each of which will cater to a dif-
ferent market. A “W” hotel on-site, for example, will be a postmodern testimony to
avant-garde design, and, it’s hoped, a youthful, trend-setting clientele. An all new Saint
Regis hotel will offer more conservative and somewhat more plush comforts geared
to the haute bourgeoisie. Into the melee will be factored an intelligent re-use of some
of the existing structures, including the Marriott. Big changes should be visible by 2008
and 2009, with the more radical transformations in place by 2010.

reason alone to stay here, although the setting is pleasant — you dine out-
side in a tropical courtyard overlooking the pool.

One&Only Ocean Club
$$$$$
Paradise Island
Tucked away on the quiet eastern side of Paradise Island, this elegant colo-
nial-style resort is as understated as the Atlantis is extravagant. For class
and style, nothing matches it on the island. In a past life, Ocean Club was
the private estate of A&P grocery-chain heir Huntington Hartford. The
resort stretches from a white sandy beach to the harbor side of the island.
At the core of the resort are formal terraced gardens, inspired by
Versailles, where stone steps, hand-laid rock ridges, and European bronze
and marble statues set off bougainvillea and hibiscus plants. Striking stone
arches of a 12th-century Augustinian cloister, which Hartford had shipped
from France and reassembled, overlook the gardens and the harbor.
Guest rooms are spacious, with views of the gardens or the beach and
ocean. All rooms come with patios or balconies, and some have king-size
mahogany four-poster beds, cane chairs, tall potted palms, hardwood
floors, and sisal rugs, plus luxurious private bathrooms. Every afternoon,
champagne and strawberries mysteriously appear in your room. The on-
site restaurants offer the finest hotel dining on Paradise Island — better
than the hotel dining rooms in Nassau or Cable Beach. Tennis courts, a
large, heated freshwater pool, and a spa are also on the premises. Take the
shuttle bus or a short walk to the 18-hole championship golf course.
Because Atlantis and Ocean Club share the same owners (Sun
International), Ocean Club guests have full access to all the facilities at
theme-park Atlantis (see its review earlier in this chapter). A courtesy bus
links Ocean Club to Atlantis.

Orange Hill Beach Inn
$
Love Beach
This hotel, set on 31⁄2 landscaped hillside acres, lies about 13km (8 miles)
west of Nassau and 1.5km (1 mile) east of Love Beach, which has great
snorkeling. It’s perfect for those who want to escape the crowds and stay
in a quieter part of New Providence Island; it’s easy to catch a cab or jitney
to Cable Beach or downtown Nassau. The welcoming owners, Judy and
Danny Lowe, an Irish-Bahamian partnership, jokingly refer to their opera-
tion as “Fawlty Towers Nassau.”
Chapter 11: Staying in Style in New Providence 141

This place was built as a private home in the 1920s and became a hotel in
1979 after the Lowes added more rooms and a swimming pool. The 33
rooms and apartments come in a variety of sizes, although most are small.
The bathrooms, likewise, are small but well maintained. Each unit has a
balcony or patio, and a few apartments are equipped with kitchenettes.
Many of the guests are European, especially in summer. It has been reno-
vated with updated furniture in the rooms, and bathrooms have been
upgraded as well. On-site is a bar serving sandwiches and salads through-
out the day, and a restaurant that offers simple but good dinners.
Management here maintains regular jitney service, without charge, to and
from the local grocery stores. Some units have kitchenettes.

Radisson Cable Beach Resort
$$$–$$$$
Cable Beach
With a broad, white sandy beach and an extensive children’s program, the
Radisson resort is a good choice for families. Offering beach olympics, arts
and crafts, treasure hunts, storytelling, and other well-supervised activi-
ties, the complimentary half- or full-day programs at Camp Junkanoo are
open to children between the ages of 4 and 11. Children under age 12 stay
free, with one or two adults. The Radisson’s tropical waterscape features
five freshwater swimming pools and also includes rock formations, water-
falls, and whirlpools.
Some 700 guest rooms in two nine-story wings form a U that cups the pools
and beautiful sandy shore. Views from lower floors showcase the gardens
while higher rooms overlook the ocean. Bedrooms are modern and com-
fortable, with large windows, balconies, and a midsize bathroom. The hotel
features a fitness center on the premises and a golf course is across the
road. When you’re not working out or teeing off, go snorkeling, scuba
diving, sailing, or play some tennis. You can dine at several good restau-
rants and, at night, listen to live music at the hotel. If you prefer, however,
you can head to the adjoining casino complex for other eats, shops, and
entertainment.

rates: $175–$250 double, from $550–$950 suite. Rates are all-inclusive. AE, MC, V.
Sandals Royal Bahamian Hotel
$$$$$
Cable Beach
Opening onto a white sand beach, this Jamaican chain member is a more
upscale all-inclusive hotel than Breezes Bahamas. With its Romanesque
statues, European spa, first-class restaurants, and two large, unheated
freshwater pools surrounded by columns, Sandals Royal Bahamian is an
elegant but more expensive alternative. A shuttle ride or a leisurely stroll
Part III: New Providence 
142

west of the Crystal Palace Casino, the hotel is removed from the busiest
section of Cable Beach. Sandals appeals to newlyweds, and many couples
get married on the hotel’s grounds. With romantic touches such as four-
poster beds and luxurious bathrooms, the individual rooms, suites, and
villas at Sandals are exclusively for couples.
As soon as you enter the lobby that’s decked out in marble with chande-
liers hanging from fresco-painted ceilings, you feel regal. You can spend a
week here and splash in a different pool every single day. You can sail off
to the hotel’s private island, complete with its own pool and restaurant,
or go snorkeling, scuba diving, or water-skiing. The cuisine at more than
half a dozen restaurants ranges from home-style Bahamian and Japanese
Teppanyaki to classic French and Northern Italian. Although the food is
plentiful, entirely presentable, and prepared with first-rate ingredients, the
Sandals kitchen never rises to the sublime. After dark, head to the theater
for live performances by local bands, dancers, and other entertainers, or
spend a quiet evening at the piano bar.
See map p. 137. W. Bay Street (a short drive or comfortable walk from the 
Crystal Palace Casino). % 800-SANDALS or 242-327-6400. Fax: 242-327-6961.

room, including all meals, beverages, and activities. Minimum two-night stay.

Sunrise Beach Club and Villas
$$$$–$$$$$
Paradise Island
This sprawling low-rise resort, drawing mostly European vacationers, is
the kind of place you picture when you think of a tropical getaway. Narrow
paths snake through the colorful grounds that are thick with palm trees,
hibiscus, crotons, and bougainvillea. This property offers only 35 units for
rent, so the atmosphere is far quieter than it is at Paradise Island resorts,
such as Atlantis.
The one-, two-, and three-bedroom villas and town houses are set in dif-
ferent areas and have varying architectural styles and décor. Some units
are tucked into the flourishing gardens, while the preferred ones overlook
the two pools (one with a cave, waterfall, and children’s wading section)
or the sand beach. Cabbage Beach, one of the best beaches in The
Bahamas, is only a short stroll to the east. Accommodations vary in size,
but all have the same comfort level. A winding staircase may lead to the
bedroom in your unit, or your master bathroom may sport a whirlpool tub.
Glass and rattan, chrome, and stained glass highlight some accommoda-
tions, while others feature more hardwood. All come with kitchens —
some larger, some smaller. 
Living up to its name, the resort’s Jungle Bar makes a scenic spot for a
drink, a conch burger (a fried conch sandwich), or other light fare.

Chapter 11: Staying in Style in New Providence 143

Wyndham Nassau Resort & Crystal Palace Casino
$$$$
Cable Beach
Adjacent to the casino that also adjoins the Radisson (which has a better
beach), this large, sprawling hotel is an epic extravaganza. Without going
outside, you can walk directly from the hotel towers to an array of restau-
rants, shops, and a fitness center. Most people hang out around the large,
heated freshwater pool with its swirling aqua-slide. If you’re traveling with
kids, consider the modest children’s program and playground.
The Wyndham doesn’t have all the glitz of mega-resort Atlantis, but it is the
island’s second-largest hotel. With its rainbow-hued towers and wings, it’s
far flashier than the Radisson and is good for party-loving types. The hotel
sells entertainment aggressively but houses you well in its accommoda-
tions towers, most of which are far enough away from the noisy public
areas for light sleepers. We prefer the Casino Tower and Tower F because
they have the grandest seafront vistas. You’ll find some of the country’s
most lavish suites here, and you can live out your fantasies — for example,
you can become Valentino in the Sheik-in-the-desert suite decorated for a
sultan.
See map p. 137. W. Bay Street (neighboring the Radisson). % 800-222-7466 or 242-
327-6200. Fax: 954-915-2929. www.wyndhamnassauresort.com. Parking: $5 valet,
free self-parking. Rack rates: $179–$250 double, $250–$500 suite. AE, DC, MC, V.

Chapter 12
Dining Out in New
Providence
In This Chapter
 Finding the best food beyond your hotel dining room
 Locating restaurants with island ambience
F
rom familiar fast-food chains to first-class international dining
rooms, New Providence offers vacationers dozens of dining choices.
The less-expensive places are in and around downtown Nassau, while
the widest selection of expensive restaurants is on Paradise Island. What
you won’t find are restaurants devoted to a healthy cuisine, although
almost every dining room offers dishes that would win the approval of
your doctor.
Getting a Taste for New Providence
You have a choice of three areas for dining: Nassau, Paradise Island, and
Cable Beach. Most visitors patronize the Nassau restaurants during the
day while on shopping and sightseeing jaunts, preferring to dine at Cable
Beach and Paradise Island in the evening.
Nassau can be dangerous after dark because of muggings. However, a
few restaurants in Nassau, such as Chez Willie, are so special that you
may want to dine there. In that case, take a taxi to the restaurant. When
you finish dinner, have the staff summon a cab to return you safely to
your hotel.
First-class restaurants always require reservations, especially during the
winter months.
Most restaurants host happy hour (actually two or three hours starting
around 5 p.m.), which is a good time to sample whatever tropical rum-
based concoction the establishment features. Dining rooms often close
between meals, but fast-food joints can satisfy your hunger. A few restau-
rants in the casino complexes don’t allow young children.

See Chapter 2 for details about local specialties and the Introduction for
an explanation of the price categories we use.
Dining at Nassau’s Best Restaurants
Bahamian Kitchen
$
Nassau
BAHAMIAN
For real local flavor and a down-home taste, head to this little eatery next
to Trinity Church. This restaurant is one of our favorite local dives, enjoy-
ing a popularity that exceeds Café Skan’s (see the review later in this chap-
ter). The Bahamian Kitchen is one of the best places to try that Bahamian
delicacy, freshly made conch salad. Some of the other delights include stew
fish (fish marinated in spices and vegetables), a creamy curried chicken,
okra soup, or pea soup and dumplings. Most dishes come with peas and
rice. If you want to eat like your Bahama mama may have cooked for you,
try such fare as corned beef and grits, all served with johnnycake. Baked
pork chops and grouper also appear on the menu. Nearly all dishes
(except the lobster) are at the low end of the price scale below. If the
weather is nice, you can order takeout and have a Bahamian picnic on 
the beach.
See map p. 148. Trinity Place, off Market Street. % 242-325-0702. Lunch and dinner
main courses: $10–$42. AE, MC, V. Open: Mon–Sat 11:30 a.m.–10 p.m.
Buena Vista
$$$$$
Nassau
CONTINENTAL
Only Graycliff and Sun and . . . (see reviews later in this chapter) do
Continental cuisine better. For more than half a century, this two-story,
19th-century mansion has been a citadel of fine food, which diners enjoy
by candlelight in mellow surroundings decorated with antique paintings.
A pianist entertains softly in winter, recapturing the flavor of the early ’40s
when the Duke and Duchess of Windsor ran The Bahamas. In fair weather,
request a table on the garden terrace and order the bartender’s special: a
rum punch with coconut milk. Meals are served on the kind of delicate
china that your grandmother keeps locked behind glass in a cabinet. The
cookery is natural, straightforward, and classic, making the best use of
quality ingredients. Highlights include tender rack of lamb, roast duckling
in a zesty orange sauce, stone crab with mustard sauce (our favorite), and
an especially delectable filet mignon in a peppercorn sauce. Chefs prepare
these dishes to perfection (if you like heavy sauces), although they hardly
tax the imagination of the kitchen staff, who has been making them for
years. Since 1946, the house’s special dessert has been Mrs. Hauck’s
orange pancakes with a Grand Marnier sauce.
See map p. 148. Delancy and Meeting streets, behind the Roman Catholic cathedral,
a block west of Government House. % 242-322-2811. Reservations recommended.

Café Matisse
$$$
Nassau
INTERNATIONAL/NORTHERN ITALIAN
This century-old former private home is a local favorite, attracting both
Bahamian government employees (it’s right behind Parliament House) and
visitors. The joint efforts of a Bahamian chef and his Italian-born wife result
in a harmonious cuisine that reaches from the islands to the
Mediterranean. The restaurant gets its name from the Matisse reproduc-
tions that hang on the walls. Café Matisse serves pizzas, including the best
frutti di mare pie in town, topped with fresh local seafood. But the cuisine
of Greg and Gabrielle Curry is far more advanced and challenging than
that. You can open your meal with their savory curried shrimp with a fra-
grant jasmine rice or the best calamari in Nassau. Our favorite main
courses are the cannelloni with lobster sauce and any of the grilled
seafood dishes, which emerge just right — still juicy, not dried out.
If the smell of cigar smoke doesn’t thrill you, steer clear of the second-floor
veranda, where patrons puffing stogies and sipping pre- and post-dinner
drinks fill the small tables. Happy hour runs from 5 to 7 p.m., and the
restaurant has live jazz a couple of nights a week.
See map p. 148. Bank Lane at Bay Street, near Parliament Square. % 242-356-7012.
Reservations recommended. Lunch main courses: $14–$20; dinner main courses:
$16–$35. AE, DISC, MC, V. Open: Tues–Sat noon to 3 p.m. and 6–10 p.m.
Café Skan’s
$
Downtown Nassau
BAHAMIAN/AMERICAN
Good, filling food that’s easy on the wallet keeps this bustling cafe packed.
Located across from the Straw Market, this establishment is more coffee
shop than cafe. The food is just as substantial as what you’d get at a reg-
ular restaurant, although you can also drop in for lighter fare, such as
sandwiches and burgers. Bahamians pile in here early in the morning to
devour dishes like their mamas made for them, including corned beef and
grits, chicken souse (chicken parts and vegetables in a seasoned broth),
stew fish, and broiled grouper with johnnycake. Of course, you can have
“the usual” — a stack of pancakes, fluffy omelets, and French toast. The
chefs turn out savory conch fritters or conch chowder, Bahamian bean
soup with dumplings, and rib-sticking pork chops. Everything is accom-
panied by generous side dishes, like peas and rice or macaroni and cheese.
The cuisine has no pretense: It’s just good, honest, straightforward food.
See map p. 148. Bay Street at Market Plaza, across the street from the Straw Market.
% 242-322-2486. Reservations not accepted. Breakfast: $4–$9; sandwiches: $6–
$12; main-course platters: $6–$20. MC, V. Open: Mon–Thurs 7:30 a.m.–5 p.m.; Fri–Sat
7:30 a.m.–6 p.m.; Sun 7:30 a.m.–4 p.m.

Chez Willie
$$$$
Nassau
FRENCH/BAHAMIAN
Elegant Nassau is recaptured at this charmer that evokes the days when
the Duke and Duchess of Windsor were ruling the roost. On a fair night,
opt for alfresco dining as you listen to piano music and admire the regal
statuary in the courtyard. The host is Willie Armstrong, and his romantic
spot is worth a journey into Nassau (take a taxi at night). Chefs imagina-
tively prepare tiptop foodstuffs or else follow classic recipes — perhaps
delicate stone-crab claws in a Dijon mustard sauce or a fresh Bahamian
tuna and crab mousse. Main courses are well-executed, including lobster
Thermidor and a sautéed Dover sole in a tarragon-laced tomato sauce. The
typical Bahamian grouper gets a fancy touch, encased in puff pastry with
crabmeat and served with a creamy coconut sauce. Other classics are beef
Wellington, a delicate chateaubriand, and a roast rack of lamb — the
Duke’s favorite dishes from the ’40s.
See map p. 148. West Bay Street. % 242-322-5364. Reservations recommended.
Jacket preferred for men. Main courses: $30–$52; fixed-price menu for two: $60–$100
per person. AE, DISC, MC, V. Open: Daily 6:30–10 p.m.
Conch Fritters Bar & Grill
$–$$
Downtown Nassau
BAHAMIAN/AMERICAN
This casual bar and grill is the best place in the center of Nassau for you
to sample conch in many variations, including not only the best conch frit-
ters in town but also cracked conch, which is the mollusk’s version of
breaded veal cutlet. This is the first local restaurant you notice when
coming in from Cable Beach to Nassau, and the eatery enjoys a mixed fol-
lowing of locals and visitors. If you don’t like conch, try the excellent
crispy fried chicken or that Florida favorite from the ’50s — surf and turf.
This is one of the places that offers guava duff, a famous Bahamian spe-
cialty, for dessert. The bright décor is enlivened by plants and wood par-
rots, and live music is presented on most nights.

Gaylord’s
$$
Nassau
INDIAN
For a change of pace, come to Gaylord’s for some of the best Indian cuisine
in Nassau. This restaurant is in a distinctive 19th-century building, and
inside, silk drapes the ceilings, decorative brass plates and sculpture are
on display, and Indian music plays. The menu includes plenty of vegetar-
ian choices, and ranges from mild, creamy kormas (balls of ground meat
or vegetables in a thick, seasoned sauce) to bold curries and tandoori
(marinated meat or fish cooked in a clay oven) main courses. Along with
Part III: New Providence 
150

lamb, beef, chicken, and fish, you’re likely to find the inevitable conch
worked into the selections. Tandoori conch was a first for us, and it’s a
tasty way to prepare this mollusk. Vegetable samosas (pastries filled with
curried vegetables or meat) make good starters. We can make a meal just
out of the freshly baked breads alone, especially when they’re filled with
flavored onions or cheese. For dessert, try the carrot pudding. 
See map p. 148. Dowdeswell Street, in front of Princess Margaret Hospital. % 242-
356-3004. Reservations recommended. Main courses: $14–$35; vegetarian dinner:

Graycliff
$$$$$
Nassau
CONTINENTAL
Opposite Government House, Graycliff is in the most atmospheric man-
sion in Nassau and is far more elegant than Buena Vista. This restaurant —
where you should dress in your most formal resort wear — is no longer
“the tops” in The Bahamas, a position it held for years. Sun and . . . , for
example, offers even better food. But for the allure of yesterday, Graycliff
still ranks high. You can order a drink on the balcony bar or ask for a table
on the cool terrace, while listening to the soft piano tunes of Coward,
Gershwin, and Cole Porter. The cuisine is basically the type that pleased
gourmets in decades past before the “revolution” came: perfectly grilled
and choice steaks, lobster Graycliff in a white-wine medora sauce, plump
juicy pheasant in a pineapple sauce, and grouper in a Dijon mustard sauce.
It’s all served up in an antique-filled setting with elegant china and old
English silverware. Graycliff continues to attract diners whose big night
out involves the consumption of Iranian caviar, fine brandy, a Grand
Marnier soufflé, Cuban cigars, and a selection from a carte of some 175,000
wine bottles.
See map p. 148. West Hill Street and Blue Hill Road, across from Government House.
% 242-322-2796. Reservations required. Jackets advised for men for dinner. Lunch

to 3 p.m. and daily 6:30–10 p.m.
The Poop Deck
$$–$$$
Nassau
BAHAMIAN/SEAFOOD
Even if this place didn’t serve good food (which it does!), we’d still hang
out here at night. We’re drawn to its open-air, waterside location with a
panoramic view of the marina — which lights up at night near the bridge
to Paradise Island. In such a setting, only a nautical atmosphere with sea-
faring artifacts will do. The food is straightforward and prepared with fresh
ingredients — perfect for The Poop Deck’s beer-drinking, cigarette-smok-
ing, sports-loving devotees. We recommend the crab-stuffed mushrooms
to start, and as an entree, the Bahamian steamed chicken, flavored with
tomatoes, onions, and sweet peppers in the Creole style, and accompa-
nied with mango salsa and sweet-potato fish cakes. The cracked lobster,
Chapter 12: Dining Out in New Providence 151

which is batter-coated and sautéed, lures in many a diner. The burgers and
sandwiches make a satisfying lunch. The chef’s version of the celebrated
guava duff is the best we’ve sampled in New Providence.
To sit at one of the best tables (at the edge of the balcony), get here just
before noon for lunch or 5 p.m. for dinner. Don’t come alone, though,
because single diners aren’t seated at these front tables.

Shoal Restaurant and Lounge
$–$$
Nassau
BAHAMIAN
This restaurant is one we return to again and again, although its food is
only slightly better than the grub served at other local favorites, such as
Conch Fritters or Café Skan’s. At times, the chefs at all these local dives
seem to use the same recipes handed down from generations. We like to
go truly Bahamian here and drop in for breakfast with friends to sample
boil fish, cooked with salt pork, onions, and green peppers. This dish is
always served with johnnycake. Chicken souse is a real morning eye-
opener, but it may be strictly for devotees, not for the faint of heart. We
asked our waiter what it’s made with. He advised, “You wouldn’t want to
know. Just eat and enjoy.” When we go to this no-frills restaurant at night,
we order the crawfish salad or the steamed conch. Of course, the menu
always features steak and lobster, too. Dishes come with fried plantains
and mounds of peas and rice. Once very scarce on menus, guava duff is
now almost a mandatory offering at every restaurant, and a sublime ver-
sion is offered here as well. The restaurant will provide transportation to
and from your hotel. You’ll need all the help you can get returning to your
hotel if you down several of the bartender’s lethal Bahama Mamas.

Nassau
CONTINENTAL
Nassau’s finest fare, even better than that of Graycliff or Buena Vista, is
served by candlelight on a patio by a rock pool. This world-class restau-
rant is a classic citadel of refined cuisine and service offered with an over-
lay of English colonial charm. An Iberian-style courtyard, complete with
fountains and a drawbridge, sets the romantic aura. Chefs prepare the
exceptional ingredients with a finely honed technique. We can’t predict
what will be on the menu when you visit, but if we awarded stars for grand
cuisine, we’d give them to the chef’s smoked moulard duck breasts or the
duck-stuffed ravioli with porcini mushrooms. Focus on the absolutely sen-
sational boiled lobster or the classic roast spring lamb, which is almost

melt-in-your-mouth tender. The soufflés are incomparable. Most diners opt
for the Grand Marnier soufflé, but our favorite is the soufflé with rum
raisins and Black Label Bacardi.

Best Restaurants
Anthony’s Caribbean Grill
$$
Paradise Island
AMERICAN/CARIBBEAN
Near the Atlantis Resort and Comfort Suites, this laid-back tropical spot
offers a pleasant alternative to hotel dining rooms. Brightly decorated with
Bahamian artwork, Anthony’s features an extensive menu that includes
familiar but well-prepared dishes that never achieve greatness but are full
of flavor, seasoning, and spice. For a taste of the islands, we go for the pep-
pery jerk chicken on a bed of multicolored pasta, known as “Rasta pasta.”
Named after the music of The Bahamas, the 20-ounce Junkanoo steak with
well-seasoned vegetables is only for the trencherman. The ribs sizzle in
their salsa laced with coconut and mango. But in general, this restaurant
is like an upscale TGI Fridays, serving the usual array of pizzas (though
some are studded with lobster), burgers, and fried chicken. The bartender
is known for his 48-ounce sparklers, with rum, vodka, amaretto, and fruit
punch. “With two of these,” the bartender assured us, “we’ll carry you out
on a stretcher.”

Bahamian Club
$$$$
Paradise Island
FRENCH/INTERNATIONAL
Within the sprawling mega-resort of the Atlantis, this restaurant is a rather
chic dining room imbued with the aura of the days of British colonialism.
No place in either New Providence or Paradise Island serves such good
cuts of meat, especially T-bone steaks and perfectly roasted prime rib.
Diners come here in search of robust flavors. The menu features classics
such as broiled lobster, Dover sole, and salmon steak. You may begin your
meal with a fresh jumbo shrimp cocktail or a salad of baby spinach leaves.
Even though the restaurant imports its main ingredients, they don’t taste
that way after the skilled chefs work their magic in the kitchen.

Café at the Great Hall Of Waters
$$$$$
Paradise Island
INTERNATIONAL
This restaurant gives you a splashy look at the water wonderland of the
Atlantis Resort, even if you’re not a guest of the hotel. Paradise Island has
better restaurants, notably Five Twins (reviewed later in this chapter), but
none are this dramatic. You feel like a scuba diver as you look through
gigantic picture windows that display the illuminated “ruins” of the lost
city of Atlantis. Everywhere you look, rainbow-hued fish swim past stone
“archaeological” remains, and rows of lobsters parade through the sand.
The restaurant offers a kids’ menu, and little ones love taking walks along
the aquarium walls between courses. In such a setting, the food becomes
almost secondary, although it’s quite good. Lobster is a specialty, but you
can also order well-prepared versions of crab legs or grilled salmon. The
chefs import top-quality ingredients, such as lamb, and work their magic
with it. Desserts are uniformly luscious.

vations required. Main courses: $30–$50. AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Thurs–Mon 7–11 a.m.,

Café Martinique
$$$$$
Paradise Island
FRENCH
The most elegant and upscale restaurant on Paradise Island lies adjacent
to the Marina Village restaurant and shopping compound that’s associated
with the Atlantis Paradise Island. This mixture of haute Paris with a French
Colonial twist is enormously appealing. A wrought-iron “birdcage” eleva-
tor hauls you and your party upstairs to the tastefully posh dining area,
where masses of flowers, trolleys laden with cheeses and dessert, and the
cuisine of superchef Jean-Georges Vongerichten await your pleasure. This
is one of the very few dining areas at Atlantis where men are asked to wear
jackets. Begin with such delectable items as foie gras, caviar, or smoked
salmon. The main courses are limited, but each dish is sublime, especially
the lobster Thermidor and the Dole sole meunière. The chefs are known
for their grills, everything from prime rib for two to a succulent veal chop.

Paradise Island
INTERNATIONAL
One of the most sophisticated and cutting-edge restaurants on Paradise
Island is in the west wing of the lobby level of the Ocean Club. It has a char-
coal gray and black décor that looks like it was plucked directly from 
a chic enclave in Milan; a sweeping view of the ocean; a teakwood floor
that evokes a yacht’s; and very attentive service. Near the restaurant’s
entrance is a thriving herb garden from which many of the culinary 
Part III: New Providence 
154

flavorings are derived. The chefs here invariably select the very finest
ingredients, which are then handled with a razor-sharp technique. Every
dish has a special something, such as shrimp dusted with orange powder
and served with artichokes and arugula. Other splendid choices are 
tuna spring rolls with soybean salsa, or chicken-and-coconut milk soup
served with shiitake cakes. The goat cheese-and-watermelon salad is an
unexpected delight. Filet of grouper — that standard throughout The
Bahamas — is at its savory best here, served with a zesty tomato sauce.

Paradise Island
ASIAN/SEAFOOD
Save this dining mecca for a special evening. While a singer croons smooth
melodies, you can eat by candlelight on fine china, either inside or outside
on a terrace that overlooks the marina. Attracting high rollers from the
nearby casino, this restaurant is the best in the Atlantis’s massive gam-
bling-and-entertainment complex. The Thai-Japanese-Indonesian cuisine
is contemporary Pacific Rim with a European flair. Color, texture, artistic
presentation and, of course, flavor play major roles in each dish, whether
you choose freshly caught grouper, snapper, shrimp, or lobster. You can
start with nuanced chilled oysters with apple slaw or a pepper-cured
salmon with vegetable tempura. The restaurant also features a sushi bar
as well as a separate upscale rum-and-cigar lounge. After dinner, a DJ spins
party tunes from a booth suspended above the dance floor. Children under
age 12 aren’t allowed in the restaurant.

Marketplace
$$$$
Paradise Island
INTERNATIONAL
Decorated with old vases and terra-cotta tiles, this large buffet-style restau-
rant is reminiscent of a sprawling market. The food is fresh, but it’s a mass
feeding station. You go here to fill up, not to find food as good as that at
Conch Fritters Bar & Grill — still, this is the finest buffet on Paradise Island.
Before you start loading your plate, browse the various cooking stations
and do some strategic planning. From fresh fruit to omelets, you can make
breakfast as light or as heavy as you want. At lunch and dinner, you can
find everything from fresh seafood and made-to-order pastas to freshly
carved roast beef and lamb. No intimate affair, this place seats some 400
diners. Sit inside or on the patio overlooking a lagoon.

Dining at Cable Beach’s Best Restaurants
The Black Angus Grill
$$$$
Cable Beach
STEAK
The casino crowd flocks to this popular restaurant. Beef is the star of the
show, but poultry and seafood play supporting roles. Because Bahamian
cattle farms don’t exist, the restaurant imports frozen meat. The meat is
always juicy, however, and the chef knows how particular some carnivores
are. So, rare means rare, medium-rare means medium-rare, and you won’t
see any pink if you ask for your meat well-done, whether you order prime
rib, filet mignon, or a T-bone steak. If you want both seafood and meat, you
can order the surf and turf — the lobster tail is sweet and plump. Another
good choice is the chicken carbonara (made with Parmesan cheese,
bacon, garlic, and white wine).

Cable Beach
BAHAMIAN/INTERNATIONAL
This brightly decorated eatery is so wild and festive that at first, you may
think it’s just a tourist trap. It’s obviously geared toward visitors, but the
island cuisine is very authentic and full of regional flavor. Enjoy familiar
favorites such as light pancakes and fluffy omelets, or on Saturday and
Sunday, try old-fashioned Bahamian recipes, including tuna and grits, boil
fish, or stewed conch (each served with johnnycakes). For substantial
Bahamian fare, you can devour the classic cracked conch with peas and
rice or enjoy the grilled mahimahi with macaroni and cheese. The icing on
the cake, so to speak, is the guava duff for dessert. On Friday at 8 p.m., a
Junkanoo band performs, turning the place into a carnival.

Overlooking the ocean from the second level of the casino complex in the

the background. Some claim “you can’t eat good Italian in The Bahamas,”
but Sole Mare proves them wrong with such standout dishes as pasta with

 Catching some rays on New Providence’s best beaches
 Enjoying the island’s watersports
 Exploring land attractions, shopping, and nightlife
 Taking two great day trips
N
ew Providence offers more action, both wet and dry, than any-
where else in The Bahamas. Watersports — from scuba diving and
snorkeling to Jet-Skiing and parasailing — keep vacationers entertained
when they aren’t playing golf or tennis, horseback riding, mountain
biking, or just strolling the streets of downtown Nassau. In this chapter,
we present the hottest nightlife, the widest selection of duty-free shops
and designer boutiques, and the best human-made attractions — from
botanical gardens to intriguing museums.
Combing the Beaches
Although mega-resorts discourage non-guests from relaxing on their
beaches, you can find plenty of unmarked, unnamed public beaches on
New Providence and Paradise Island.
Beaches that are absolutely accessible to the public are
 Cabbage Beach: On Paradise Island, this beach is a real showcase.
Its broad, white sands stretch for at least 3km (2 miles). Casuarines,
palms, and sea grapes border it. This beach draws crowds in winter,
but you can find a little more elbow room by walking to the north-
western stretch of the beach. You can reach Paradise Island from
downtown Nassau by walking over the bridge, taking a taxi, or board-
ing a ferry at Prince George Dock. Cabbage Beach doesn’t have
public bathroom facilities, but you can patronize one of the handful
of bars and restaurants nearby and use its facilities. Technically,
you are a customer even if you buy only one soft drink.

Inset

 Cable Beach: The name “Cable Beach” refers to a string of resorts
and beaches that lie in the center of New Providence’s northern
coast. This beachfront is the most popular area in The Bahamas. It
offers 7km (4 miles) of soft, white sand, and the hotels that line the
waterfront offer diverse restaurants, snack bars, and watersports.
Calypso music floats to the sand from hotel pool patios, where
vacationers play musical chairs and see how low they can limbo.
Vendors wind their way between sunblock-slathered bodies. Some
sell armloads of shell jewelry, T-shirts, beach cover-ups, and fresh
coconuts. Others offer their hair-braiding services or sign up visi-
tors for water-skiing, Jet-Skiing, and banana-boat rides. Kiosks
advertise parasailing, scuba diving, and snorkeling trips, as well as
party cruises to offshore islands.
Waters can be rough and reefy, but a little farther along the shore,
they can be calm and clear. Because guests of the resorts use their
hotel facilities, no public restrooms are available here. (If you’re
not a guest of the hotel, you’re not supposed to use the facilities.)
The Cable Beach resorts begin 5km (3 miles) west of downtown
Nassau. Even though resorts line much of this long swath of beach,
the public can access various sections of the beach without cross-
ing private hotel grounds.
 Caves Beach: On the north shore, past the Cable Beach properties,
Caves Beach lies some 11km (7 miles) west of Nassau. It stands
near Rock Point, right before the turnoff along Blake Road that
leads to the airport. Most visitors don’t know of this place, so it’s
usually not crowded. This beach has soft sands. No toilets or
changing facilities are available here.
 Delaporte Beach: Just west of the busiest section of Cable Beach,
Delaporte Beach is another public-access beach where you can
escape the crowds. It opens onto clear waters and boasts white
sands, although it has no toilets or changing facilities.
 Goodman’s Bay: This public beach is east of Cable Beach on the
way toward the center of Nassau. Goodman’s Bay and Saunders
Beach (see review later in this section) often host local fundraising
cookouts where vendors sell fish, chicken, conch, peas and rice, or
macaroni and cheese. People swim and socialize to blaring reggae
and calypso music. To find out when one of these beach parties is
happening, ask the staff at your hotel or pick up a local newspaper.
This beach has a playground, plus toilets.
 Paradise Beach: This gem is one of Paradise Island’s best beaches.
Chikees (thatched huts) — which are great when you’ve had too
much sun — dot this white sandy beach. It lies at the far western
tip of the island, and is largely populated with guests of the Atlantis.
If you’re not a resident of the Atlantis, getting access to the beach
is difficult. If you’re staying at a hotel in Nassau and want to come
to Paradise Island for a day at the beach, you’re better off going to
Cabbage Beach (see earlier review in this section).
Part III: New Providence 
162

 Saunders Beach: This beach, located east of Cable Beach, is where
many islanders go on the weekends. To reach it, take West Bay
Street from Nassau in the direction of Coral Island. This beach 
lies across from Fort Charlotte, just west of Arawak Cay. Like
Goodman’s Bay (see review earlier in this section), it often hosts
fun local fundraising cookouts that are open to the public. This
beach doesn’t have any public facilities.
 Western Esplanade (also called Junkanoo Beach): If you’re staying
at a hotel in downtown Nassau, such as the British Colonial, this is
a good nearby beach to visit. It’s a narrow strip of sand and has a
snack bar, changing facilities, and toilets.
Playing in the Surf
Most water action jumps off from Cable Beach, Paradise Beach, and
Prince George Dock in downtown Nassau. For a change of scenery,
many folks board tour boats to Blue Lagoon Island and Rose Island, two
popular cays just offshore.
Jet-Skiing, parasailing, banana-boat rides, water-skiing, and windsurfing
are available on the beaches in front of Cable Beach and Paradise Island
hotels. In many cases, however, independent vendors who aren’t affili-
ated with the hotels run these sports, which means that the resorts
aren’t responsible for any problems that may arise.
Snorkeling and parasailing
If you want shallow diving and snorkeling without having to go out on a
boat, New Providence Island offers dozens of possibilities. Our favorite
spot is Love Beach, near the Compass Point hotel. Also attracting snor-
kelers are such scenic areas as Rose Island Reefs, Booby Rock Channel,
and Gambier Deep Reef, plus some underwater wrecks lying in shallow
water.
In the western part of the island, the nature reserve at offshore Gouldings
Reef Cay offers some of the best snorkeling on the island, and it’s never
crowded. You can see some of the most majestic elkhorn coral in all of
The Bahamas. 
Excursions by boat take you to the best and most dramatic snorkeling
sites — sites that are more impressive than what you can do yourself 
off the coast. Barefoot Sailing Cruises (% 242-393-0820; www.barefoot
sailingcruises.com) is based at Bayshore Marina, on East Bay Street
near the Paradise Island bridge. Their 12m (41-ft.) sailboat takes no more
than 16 passengers; their 17m (56-ft.) sailboat holds a maximum of 30,
and their 20m (65-ft.) catamaran accommodates 65. The size and type of
boat that you sail on depends on the number of people booked on any
given day. A half-day snorkel sail to Atholl Island or Spruce Cay runs
Chapter 13: Having Fun On and Off the Beach in New Providence 163

$55 per person, including beverages and snacks; the full-day trip costs
$89 with lunch.
Another good choice is Flying Cloud (% 242-393-4430), which is based
at the ferry terminal on Paradise Island. This 17m (57-ft.) catamaran
takes a maximum of 50 passengers. Snorkeling cruises go to Rose Island
for a half-day of fun that costs $55 per person; a two-and-half-hour
sunset cruise costs $50 per person. Snorkel gear and lessons, if neces-
sary, are included in the price, along with transportation to and from
your accommodations.
Parasailing is another exhilarating sport. You’re strapped to a parachute
that’s tied with a long leash to a boat. As the boat takes off, you float
gently into the air as if you’re flying. Independent operators along Cable
Beach and Paradise Island Beach charge about $40 for eight to ten min-
utes in the sky.
Scuba diving
If you visit any of the Out Islands, you may want to save your under-
water scuba time for those less-visited reefs. The waters around New
Providence offer excellent dive sites, but too many scuba divers may be
admiring all the tropical fish, huge sponges, and varied coral reefs
around the dramatic caves, cliffs, ocean holes, ledges, and wrecks.
On New Providence Island, Southwest Reef lures scuba divers with its
giant coral heads that stand in anywhere from 4 to 8m (12–25 ft.) of
water, with staghorn corals and elkhorn along with rainbow-hued fish.
Another great dive site is Shark Wall, lying 16km (10 miles) off the coast,
along with such sites as Razorback, Booby Rock Reef, and Rose Island
Reef. Dive outfitters can also lead you to the many old shipwrecks off
the coast, along with caves and cliffs. Wrecks include Mahoney and
Alcora, and the wreck used in the James Bond film, Never Say Never
Again. Divers also explore the airplane propeller used in another Bond
film, Thunderball.
Neophytes can take a quickie “resort course,” also known as a begin-
ner’s class (about $89). Full-certification courses run anywhere from
$499 to $695. Plan to pay about $89 for a two-tank dive, $55 to $65 for a
night dive, and $110 to $130 for a shark dive. Most operators sell you a
videotape of your aqua-action for about $50, and they transport you to
and from your hotel.
With more than three decades of experience, Bahama Divers (% 242-
393-5644), at the Nassau Yacht Haven by the bottom of the Paradise
Island bridge, is Nassau’s oldest and most reliable company.
Even if you’re not a scuba diver, you and your kids can still breathe
underwater. Try helmet diving with Hartley’s Undersea Walk (% 242-
393-8234; www.underseawalk.com) at the Nassau Yacht Haven on East
Part III: New Providence 
164

Bay Street. During this three-and-a-half-hour excursion (about $75), you
take a 30-minute boat ride out to a reef. After donning a lead and glass
helmet, you descend a ladder into 4 to 5m (12–15 ft.) of water. Air is
pumped into the helmet through a long tube. You can keep your glasses
on or your contact lenses in, because your face and hair stay completely
dry. Following the instructions of your guide, you spend about 20 min-
utes wandering in slow motion around the ocean floor, past crayon-
colored sea plants, corals, and fish. To secure your reservation, arrive 
30 minutes before your scheduled departure time.
Climbing Aboard
You can experience Bahamian waters and marine life firsthand without
getting wet. But remember that these are Atlantic waters, not the tran-
quil Caribbean Sea, and the waves can be rough at times, causing sea-
sickness for those who aren’t used to it.
Sailing
For the best sailing charter to some of the Out Islands, try Amarok
Sailing Charters (% 719-379-4605 or 242-477-4471). The crewed 12m
(41-ft.) Amarok ketch carries up to six passengers and specializes in six-
day trips to the Exumas, which are about five hours from Nassau. The
trip costs from $1,800 per couple. You can read more about the Exumas
in Chapter 24.
For a shorter sailing adventure, Barefoot Sailing Cruises (% 242-393-
0820) offers a two-hour champagne sunset cruise ($39, including cold
hors d’oeuvres). You sail through Nassau Harbour, under the bridges,
into Montagu Bay, by the cruise ships, and maybe along the northern
coast of Paradise Island. You can munch cheese and crackers as you sip
your bubbly, and you don’t need to dress up — many passengers wear
shorts. The price includes ground transportation. Depending on the
number of vacationers booked, you may cruise on a 12m (41-ft.) sailboat
carrying no more than 16 passengers or a 16m (54-ft.) sailboat taking a
maximum of 30.
Flying Cloud (% 242-393-4430) carries up to 50 passengers on its 17m
(57-ft.) catamaran. Depending on the time of year that you go, the two-
and-a-half-hour evening cruise takes in the setting sun ($45, including
hot and cold hors d’oeuvres). During the three-hour dinner cruise ($50),
you can chow down on soup, salad, fish, beef, rice, vegetables, and
dessert, served with wine. All rates cover transportation to and from
your hotel.
When comparing Barefoot Sailing Cruises and Flying Cloud, we find
cruises aboard Barefoot more adventurous and fun, especially when the
passengers are few. For a real sailing experience, book on a sailboat
instead of the larger catamaran. If the catamarans are crowded, you may
Chapter 13: Having Fun On and Off the Beach in New Providence 165

feel like you’re riding on a cattle boat, especially with all the eating and
drinking. On a sailboat, the atmosphere is more romantic, and the night
is yours.
Another option is Majestic Tours Ltd. (% 242-322-2606), which books
three-hour cruises on two of the biggest catamarans in the Atlantic.
These tours offer views of the water, sun, sand, and outlying reefs. The
downside of these cruise boats is the large number of passengers
aboard. The upside is that they’re affordable and the most profession-
ally run. The Yellow Bird carries up to 250 passengers and departs from
Prince George’s Dock; ask for the exact departure point when you make
your reservation. The cost is $25 per adult, $12 for children under 10;
snorkeling equipment is $12 extra. The outfitter has another boat, the
Robinson Crusoe, which holds 350 passengers. On Wednesday, Friday,
and Sunday, cruises run from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.; adults cost $50 per
person and children 11 and under are half price. Sunset dinner cruises
are on Tuesday and Friday from 7 to 10 p.m.; adults cost $55 per person
and children are half price.
Dolphin diversions and other ocean adventures
Are dolphins really smiling? Why is their skin so warm and smooth? Can
they understand each other’s chatter? Find out the answers to these
questions and many more during a Dolphin Encounter on Blue Lagoon
Island (% 242-363-1003). This popular activity is often booked well in
advance.
The Close Encounter program ($85) enables you to stand in shallow
water and pet the dolphins, and the Swim with the Dolphins program
($165) lets you delve deeper. Both sessions last about three hours,
including the boat ride to and from Blue Lagoon, a part of Salt Cay,
which is about 5km (3 miles) northeast of Paradise Island.
Several tour operators take visitors to and from Blue Lagoon Island, but
you can’t book a Dolphin Encounter through all of them.
Some marine studies show that contrary to popular belief, dolphins
don’t like being touched by humans. So you can decide whether you
want to interact with an animal that may not be enjoying your company.
Enjoying semi-submarine rides
To see coral reefs, you can take a ride in a semi-submarine. Contact
Seaworld Explorer (% 242-356-2548) to board its 45-passenger semi-
submersible observatory. The trip begins with a 15-minute catamaran
ride and narrated tour along Nassau’s coastline. Then you spend about
an hour in the “sub.” The vessel doesn’t actually dive, but it does have
windows that are about 3m (10 ft.) below the surface of the ocean, so
you get close-up views of fish, coral, and a shipwreck. This 90-minute
excursion takes you to Sea Gardens Marine Park and costs $37 for
adults and $19 for children ages 3 to 12. You can arrange transportation
Part III: New Providence 
166

between your hotel and the trip’s starting point — Bay Street and
Elizabeth Avenue in downtown Nassau — for an additional $3 each way.
Fishing for fun
Bahamian waters are thick with game fish, and some travelers spend
every day of their vacations casting lines. The best time to fish for wahoo
is from November to February; for blue marlin, June and July; and for
bonito and blackfin tuna, May to August. For a half-day charter for two
to six anglers, you can spend anywhere from $400 to $600 or, for a full
day, $800 and up. If you want to join a group for a half-day (usually in the
morning), you spend about $70 per person. Two of New Providence’s
best companies are Born Free Charters (% 242-363-4144; www.born
freefishing.com) and Nassau Yacht Haven (% 242-393-8173; www.
nassauyachthaven.com).
Exploring on Dry Land
Wandering the historic streets of Nassau is an adventure in itself. Seeing
the sights from a horse-drawn carriage makes you feel as if you’ve been
transported into the past. From impressive old forts, small museums,
and attractive pink-and-white government buildings to manicured gar-
dens, aquariums, and a zoo, New Providence and Paradise Island can
keep you busy.
To get around New Providence, you can rent a car, take taxis, or hop
aboard the far cheaper jitneys (public buses or vans that run in front of
Cable Beach hotels and throughout Nassau). These vans may take a
while, but they eventually get you within shouting distance of the attrac-
tions in this area. Jitney routes are often roundabout, but you’re treated
to impromptu tours of neighborhoods that you may otherwise miss.
To get to Paradise Island, you can take a taxi across the bridge from
Nassau or you can walk. After you’re there, you can take shuttle buses
around the island or hoof it.
The following attractions are the best that New Providence offers.
Ardastra Gardens & Zoo
Nassau
The gardens here are a treat for the eyes, but the animals are the real draw.
You see creatures great and small, from iguanas, hutias (indigenous
rodents), and peacocks to monkeys, lemurs, and various felines. You can
even stroke a tame boa constrictor or get your photo snapped with a col-
orful macaw on your shoulder.
The zoo is known for its marching flamingos performances. The fun begins
when the leggy pink birds trot en masse into the arena. Like a drill ser-
geant, their trainer shouts commands, and the flamingos all stop, abruptly
Chapter 13: Having Fun On and Off the Beach in New Providence 167

change direction, or stretch out their wings. The trainers summon audi-
ence members to join the flock in hilarious poses. After the performance,
you can ask the flamingos for their autographs as they gather by the lake
with the wild ducks and Australian black swans. Allow about 90 minutes
for the show, which hits the stage three times a day.
See map p. 160. West Bay Street and Chippingham Road, near Ft. Charlotte. % 242-
323-5806. www.ardastra.com. From Cable Beach, take bus #10 that travels along
West Bay Street; or you can take a brief taxi ride. Admission: $12 for adults, $6 for
children. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–4:30 p.m.
Atlantis Aquarium
Paradise Island
The world’s largest tropical aquarium exhibits some 50,000 sharks,
stingrays, turtles, and other fish and sea creatures collected from around
the planet. Plan to spend about 90 minutes here.
If you want to slide down the waterfall on the “Mayan temple” through a
clear tube that cuts through a shark tank, you have to book a room at the
Atlantis Resort or one of its sibling properties (the Ocean Club or neigh-
boring Comfort Suites). Only guests of these hotels can ride down the
water slides, swim in the elaborate pools, and enjoy the many other out-
door aquatic attractions.
Both guests and non-guests, however, can walk through the acrylic under-
water tube, looking up to see hammerheads that seem to swim past palm
trees through the sky above you. In the dim passageways of “The Dig,” col-
orful fish swarm around streets and statues evocative of Atlantis.
Feedings of the giant green moray eels occur twice a day; before you visit,
check the times. At the touch tank, children get a kick out of handling the
spiky sea urchins, large conch shells, soft starfish, and surprisingly heavy

Atlantis Paradise Island Resort & Casino
Paradise Island
Gambling is the main event here, but there’s so much to see at the enter-
tainment complex of this mega-resort. Although most casinos keep the out-
doors outdoors, the unusual design of this huge casino allows sun-
shine to stream in through skylights. Designer boutiques, watering holes,
restaurants — all on the expensive side — and plenty of gaping vacationers
surround the casino.

Fort Charlotte
Nassau
If you have the time or desire to see only one fort in New Providence, make
it Fort Charlotte. With a commanding view of the harbor, it was built in
1788 by Lord Dunmore, the royal governor, and named for Queen
Charlotte, the wife of King George III. Tour guides tell visitors all about 
the moat, drawbridge, cannons, underground passages, and dungeons, 
but relate no stories of battles because the fort never saw one. You aren’t
charged for admission, but your guide expects a tip. You can combine 
a visit here with a trip to nearby Ardastra Gardens & Zoo and Arawak
Cay (where local chefs whip up Bahamian favorites in small, no-frills
restaurants).
See map p. 160. West Bay Street and Chippingham Road, about a mile west of down-
town Nassau. No phone. Admission: Free. Open: Daily 8 a.m.–4 p.m.
Fort Fincastle and the Water Tower
Nassau
Like Fort Charlotte, Nassau’s other major fort, Fincastle never saw a battle.
It was a lighthouse until 1816 when it was turned into a signal tower, 61m
(200 ft.) above the sea. Its 38m-tall (126-ft.) Water Tower, which you can
reach by taking an elevator to the observation platform, gives you the
most panoramic view of New Providence. The fort is named in honor of
Lord Dunmore, the royal governor who ordered its construction in 1793.
His second title was Viscount Fincastle.
Young men hang out here, insisting that you go on a guided tour, but you
can easily see the remains and enjoy the view on your own. These would-
be tour guides are hard to shake off, however.
See map p. 160. Bennett’s Hill, Elizabeth Avenue, just south of Shirley Street.
Admission for Water Tower: $1. Open: Mon–Sat 8 a.m.–5 p.m.
Hairbraider’s Centre
Nassau
Whether you want a single beaded plait, cornrows in an intricate design,
or many itty-bitty loose braids with colorful rubber bands, this open-air
pavilion is the place to go. Depending on what style you want, the cost
ranges from $3 to more than $100, and styling can take anywhere from min-
utes to hours to complete. At one time, hairbraiders roamed the shores of
Cable Beach and Paradise Island in search of customers. Although you still
may find some of these nimble-fingered women hawking their services on
the sand, the government set up the Hairbraider’s Centre to cut down on
beach vendors. Normally, you can find braiders here Monday through
Saturday between 9 a.m. and 3:30 or 4 p.m. A few braiders may show up on
a Sunday if they need money and some cruise ships are in port.

Historic Nassau
Set aside a couple of hours for some good old-fashioned Nassau street-
walking. You won’t even get arrested. As you wander through the capital,
you’ll see that the past is well preserved. The best time for an amble is
after 10 a.m. and before 4 p.m., Monday through Saturday. Many stores and
museums close on Sunday, and on Saturday, the streets are congested
because that’s when the Changing of the Guard takes place at Government
House. Try to find out from the staff at your hotel when the fewest cruise
ships are in port, because those passengers really clog the center of town.
A good place to begin your tour is Rawson Square, which links Bay Street,
the main thoroughfare, with Prince George Wharf, also known as Prince
George Dock, where the cruise ships dock. Horse-drawn carriages — each
carrying up to three passengers — wait here to give leisurely tours. You
can also see a statue of former shopkeeper Sir Milo Butler, the country’s
first native Bahamian — and first post-independence — governor. On the
northern side of the square, the Ministry of Tourism Information Booth
doles out helpful maps and brochures. Across the way is Parliament
Square, with its statue of a young Queen Victoria and its pink, white-
trimmed Georgian-style government buildings that date back to the late
1700s and early 1800s.
Nassau Public Library and Museum, on Bank Lane, is an octagonal build-
ing, which has been here since around 1797, and was once the Nassau Gaol
(in other words, the local slammer). Shelves of books line the small prison
cells. History buffs can check out the time-worn prints and colonial docu-
ments in the little museum. Stamp collectors head for the Nassau General
Post Office at the end of Parliament Street. You can then walk northeast
to the foot of Queen’s Staircase. These 65 steps lead to Fort Fincastle and
the Water Tower, both of which offer views of Nassau and the harbor.
To the west, at Duke and George streets, stands the pink-and-white
Government House. Since 1801, this house has been the official resi-
dence of the governor-general, the queen’s representative. A statue of
Christopher Columbus stands midway up the front steps. The stately
white columns and wide circular driveway make this mansion the perfect
setting for the dignified Changing of the Guard Ceremony that takes place
outside every other Saturday at 10 a.m. The real crowd-pleaser of this
event is the Royal Bahamas Police Force Band. The music is at least 
as colorful as the uniforms: stark-white tunics, navy trousers with bright
red stripes, and white pitch helmets with crimson bands.
If you’re into antiques, walk north (back toward Bay Street) to the re-
stored Balcony House, located at Market Street and Trinity Place. This
Part III: New Providence 
170

18th-century, two-story house with a balcony is Nassau’s oldest wooden 
residential building. Furniture from the early 1800s through the 1940s dec-
orates the rooms, and most visitors rave about the handsome mahogany
staircase that was salvaged from a wrecked ship during the 1800s. You can
spend a half-hour here. A donation is expected.
Finally, stroll over to the open-air Straw Market at Market Street, where
vendors sell items such as shell jewelry, clothing made from African and
Indonesian fabrics, woodcarvings, sun hats, baskets, place mats, and bags
woven from straw. East of the Straw Market is the waterfront Woodes
Rodgers Walk, which is lined by mail boats, sponge boats, and vendors
hawking fruit, vegetables, fish, and conch. Continue your stroll until you
reach the imposing cruise ships docked back at Prince George Wharf.
Junkanoo Expo
Nassau
Unless you’re vacationing during Christmas or New Year’s, you’ll miss the
beloved Junkanoo Festival. This country’s answer to Carnival and Mardi
Gras begins with a parade in the wee hours of Boxing Day (Dec 26) and
New Year’s Day. If your visit doesn’t coincide with the real deal, the
Junkanoo Expo, which is housed in an old Customs shed, is the next-best
thing. With a little imagination, you can picture the colorful costumes and
whimsical masks on dancers and musicians as they parade down Bay
Street. You can also watch the video of last year’s bash. Some of the hand-
crafted costumes on display take months to create.

Free. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–6 p.m.
National Art Gallery of The Bahamas
Nassau
At long last, The Bahamas has a national gallery to showcase its talented
artists. In a restored historic building in the center of Nassau, the gallery
displays Bahamian art, past and present. Bahamian art, as an entity, has
existed for only 50 years. Museum curators claim that the current collec-
tion is only the nucleus of a long-range strategy to beef up the number of
works. Most paintings in the exhibit are divided into a historical and a con-
temporary collection. The collection honors pioneering Bahamian artists
as well as younger and more modern painters. Even though some paint-
ings fall into the realm of primitive or even native art, many are quite
sophisticated — especially Amos Ferguson’s Snowbirds. In this painting,
Ferguson used house paint on cardboard to create a remarkable portrait.

Pirates of Nassau Museum
Nassau
You need half an hour for the self-guided tour through this museum that
brings Nassau’s buccaneering days to life. During the 18th century, pirates
ruled the waves around New Providence as they grew rich from the goods
they pillaged from merchant ships. You can go below deck on a replica of
a pirate ship, Revenge, where you can view the kitchen area, hammocks,
cannons, and animals, such as goats, chickens in crates, and, of course,
rats. Battles rage through the special effects of sounds and lights, and the
dungeon feels damp and creepy. You can hear pirates planning their next
attack and smell the sea air. Kids of all ages enjoy the wax figures and the
re-created ship and buildings, including the favorite pirate hangout: the
tavern. Exhibits tell the story of Woodes Rodgers, who the English crown
shipped here to clean up the pirate pandemonium.
See map p. 160. Corner of King and George streets, a block south of the Straw Market.

Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–6 p.m.; Sun 9 a.m.–12:30 p.m.
Potter’s Cay
Nassau
In the islands, the local market is an integral part of daily life. Already vis-
ited the Straw Market? Fine, but that overcrowded bazaar is for tourists.
On the other hand, Potter’s Cay, located beneath the original Paradise
Island bridge, is for Bahamians. This place is an ideal spot for watching
sloops from the Out Islands bring in huge mounds of glistening fish and
conch. Seeing restaurant chefs buying fresh seafood straight off the boats
isn’t unusual.
You can even take notes for your own kitchen while a fisherman prepares
conch salad that couldn’t be any fresher: He bores a hole into the shell,

Amos Ferguson: The painting painter
The Bahamas’ best known artist, Amos Ferguson, used to be a house painter. Born on
Exuma in 1920, he once ran a small farm and helped with his father’s carpentry busi-
ness. When he later moved to Nassau, he took up house painting. Using house paint
instead of oil or acrylic, he started creating striking color-rich “naive” pictures. Many
vacationers got to know his early work through a Nassau Straw Market vendor named
Bea, who eventually became his wife.
During the 1980s, Ferguson tumbled onto the international art scene. His often whim-
sical works — still created with house paint — are now owned by collectors around
the world. His thought-provoking themes revolve around biblical and historical images,
nature and folklore, and the masks, costumes, and music of the Bahamian Junkanoo
festival.

extracts the unfortunate conch, skins it, dices it, marinates it in lime juice,
and seasons it with onions and peppers. In the stalls that line the water’s
edge, vendors sell this zesty salad along with conch fritters, conch chow-
der, and fresh herbs. You also find pineapples (many from Eleuthera),
bananas, papayas, limes, and other just-plucked fruit.
Vendors here don’t appreciate having their photographs taken, especially
if you’re not purchasing anything. Point a camera in their direction, and
they make their objections abundantly clear. As colorful as this site can
be, abstain from capturing it on film, unless you have a very long lens or
a 007-style camera hidden in your sunglasses.
See map p. 160. Located directly under the bridge that links Nassau and Paradise
Island.
Queen’s Staircase
Nassau
During the 1790s, enslaved men cut 65 steps out of solid limestone to form
a staircase leading from old Nassau to the top of Fort Fincastle. Later, this
31m (102-ft.) staircase was named in honor of the 65-year reign of Queen
Victoria.
At the bottom of the stairs, guides wait to present the history of the stair-
case. Their recitations are so well memorized that some of them sound
like robotic recordings. At the top, you can easily walk to Fort Fincastle
and the Water Tower.
See map p. 160. Across Shirley Street, toward the rise away from the harbor, and
near Princess Margaret Hospital in downtown Nassau.
The Retreat
Nassau
You can visit the Botanical Gardens, but the 4.5 hectares (11 acres) of this
National Trust property are better maintained. Two hundred species of
rare and exotic palms from around the world, other unusual trees, and del-
icate native orchids fill these flourishing grounds.
The Retreat is the place for birders to see and hear all kinds of feathered
friends, such as banana quits, northern mockingbirds, black-and-white
warblers, and red-legged tanagers.
You can take a half-hour tour on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday at
noon, or visit on your own. The Retreat is about a 20- to 30-minute taxi ride
from Cable Beach, depending on traffic. If you don’t mind a longer trip, you
can also take a public bus from the hotel areas.

Versailles Gardens and Cloister
Paradise Island
Europe is literally transported to The Bahamas in these gardens. This 
12th-century cloister was originally built by Augustinian monks in south-
western France and was reassembled here, stone by stone. But the
reassembly of the complicated monument didn’t follow most conventional
construction methods. Huntington Hartford, the A&P grocery heir, pur-
chased the cloister from the estate of William Randolph Hearst at San
Simeon in California. Unfortunately, after Hearst bought the cloister, it was
hastily dismantled in France for shipment to America, but the parts
weren’t numbered — and they all arrived unlabeled on Paradise Island.
The monument puzzle remained unsolved until artist and sculptor Jean
Castre-Manne set about to reassemble it, piece by piece. It took him two
years, and what you see today presumably bears some similarity to the
original. Tropical flowers and classical statues fill the gardens, which
extend over the rise to Nassau Harbour. Although the monument remains
a timeless beauty, recent buildings have encroached on either side, mar-
ring Huntington Hartford’s original vision.

Walking tours
Nassau
Goombay Guided Walking Tours, arranged by the Ministry of Tourism,
leave from the Tourist Information Booth on Rawson Square daily. Tours
last for one hour and include descriptions of some of the city’s most 
venerable buildings, with commentaries on Nassau’s history, customs, and
traditions.
See map p. 160. Tourist Information Booth on Rawson Square in Nassau. % 242-
323-3102. Admission: $12 for all ages. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–2 p.m. Tour schedule varies;
advance reservations required.
Keeping Active
Most of the sports action in and around New Providence is linked to the
Atlantic. But when you’re ready to dry off, you have plenty of choices.
Biking
A half-day bicycle tour with Bahamas Outdoors Ltd. (% 242-362-1574;
www.bahamasoutdoors.com; about $59) takes you on a 5km (3-mile)
bike ride along some scenic forest and shoreline trails in the Coral
Harbour area on the southwestern coast of New Providence. You pass
along a trail with a scenic backdrop of mangrove creeks and pine forests
and can take time off for a kayak trip to a shallow for snorkeling.
Part III: New Providence 
174

Some of the major hotels on Paradise Beach and Cable Beach rent bikes
to their guests. You can bike along Cable Beach or the beachfront at
Paradise Island, but Nassau traffic is too congested.
Golfing
New Providence courses frequently host international tournaments. 
At the 18-hole Cable Beach Golf Course (% 242-327-1741), the oldest
course in The Bahamas, greens fees run $140 with carts included. This
course is the most convenient for many vacationers because it’s just
across the road from the main Cable Beach hotels. Ocean Club Golf
Club on Paradise Island Drive (% 242-363-6682), at the east end of 
the island, is an 18-hole championship golf course designed by Tom
Weiskopf. This course overlooks both the Atlantic Ocean and Nassau
Harbour. Attracting every caliber of golfer, the par-72 course is famous
for its Hole 17, which plays entirely along the scenic Snorkelers Cove.
Greens fees, including cart, are $250 per player, and rental clubs and
shoes are available.
Gyms and spas
Many of the large hotels have exercise rooms for guests to use. Some
also offer spa facilities, including Sandals Royal Bahamian and the
Crystal Palace Casino complex, both on Cable Beach; and Atlantis
Paradise Island Resort & Casino and One&Only Ocean Club, both on
Paradise Island. If your hotel doesn’t have a gym or spa, or if you need
more extensive equipment or pampering to keep up your routine, check
out Windermere Spa & Salon (% 242-393-0033) at the Harbour Bay
Shopping Centre on East Bay Street in Nassau.
Horseback rides
Small groups of riders spend 90 minutes riding along wooded and 
beachside trails through Happy Trails Stables (% 242-362-1820; www.
bhahamahorse.com). The $95 price tag includes transportation between
your hotel and the stables. The stables are in the Coral Harbour area in
southwestern New Providence, about 20 minutes from Cable Beach and
45 minutes from Paradise Island. You have to make reservations for
these guided rides, which go out twice a day.
Tennis
Among hotels with tennis courts — some lit for night play — are the
Radisson, Sandals, and Nassau Beach Hotel on Cable Beach, and the
Atlantis and One&Only Ocean Club on Paradise Island. Some hotels
allow in-house guests to play for free, but other hotels charge a small
hourly fee. If your hotel doesn’t have courts, you can arrange to play
elsewhere, usually for $5 to $7 an hour, plus about $6 for racquet rental.

Shopping the Local Stores
You can find a variety of bargains in Nassau, including Swiss watches,
Japanese cameras, French perfumes, Irish crystal and linens, and British
china.
You don’t have to pay import duties on 11 categories of luxury goods,
including china, crystal, fine linens, jewelry, leather goods, photography
equipment, watches, fragrances, and other merchandise. Antiques, of
course, are exempt from import duty worldwide. But even though prices
are duty-free, you can still end up spending more on an item in The
Bahamas than you would back in your hometown. It’s a tricky situation.
If you’re contemplating a major purchase, such as a good Swiss watch 
or expensive perfume, do some research in your hometown discount
outlets before making a serious purchase in The Bahamas. Although the
alleged 30- to 50-percent discount off stateside prices may apply on
some purchases, that’s not true in most cases. We discovered that cer-
tain cameras and electronic equipment are listed in The Bahamas at, say,
20 percent or more below the manufacturer’s “suggested retail price.”
That sounds good, except the manufacturer’s “suggested retail price”
may be a lot higher than what you’d pay in your hometown. You aren’t
getting the discount you think you are. Some shoppers even take along
department-store catalogs from the States to determine whether the
items they’re considering are indeed a bargain.
Mostly European, American, and Asian imports fill vacationers’ shop-
ping bags. Bahamian-made goods are much scarcer. Even at Nassau’s
Straw Market, you may be surprised at the number of items made in
China, Indonesia, and Kenya. But at this open-air market, you also find
plenty of locally produced straw goods, along with Bahamian sauces and
seasonings, perfumes, woodcarvings, shell jewelry, dolls, and art.
Be prepared for persistent vendors. Someone may slip a necklace
around your neck in an attempt to convince you that you can’t live with-
out it. In addition to the large Bay Street Straw Market, you find similar
setups across from the Radisson and Wyndham hotels on Cable Beach.
Pay the first price you’re quoted, and the vendor will look at you as if
you have three eyes. Bargaining is a way of life here. Don’t be afraid to
turn your back on something you really want. Chances are, the previ-
ously stubborn vendor will call after you with a suddenly reduced price
that’s “only for you.”
Although bargaining is expected at straw and produce markets, it isn’t
welcome at all in most stores. At glitzy boutiques, such as the ones at
Atlantis Paradise Island Resort & Casino, salespeople give you a price
and stand firm.

Antiques
Marlborough Antiques (corner of Queen and Marlborough streets; 
% 242-328-0502) carries the type of antiques you’d expect to find in a
shop in London: antique books, antique maps and engravings, English
silver (both sterling and plate), and unusual table settings (fish knives
and so on). Among the store’s most appealing objects is its collection of
antique photographs of the islands. Works by Bahamian artists Brent
Malone and Maxwell Taylor are also on display.
Art
Although many locals come to Kennedy Gallery (on Parliament Street;
% 242-325-7662) for custom framing, the gallery also sells original art-
work by well-known Bahamian artists, including limited-edition prints,
handicrafts, pottery, and sculpture.
Brass and copper
With two branches on Charlotte Street, the Brass and Leather Shop
located at 12 Charlotte St., between Bay and Shirley streets (% 242-322-
3806) offers English brass, handbags, luggage, briefcases, attachés, and
personal accessories. Shop number two, located at Marathon Mall on
Marathon Road, sells handbags, belts, scarves, ties, and small leather
goods from such famous designers as Furla, Bottega Veneta, Pierre
Balmain, and others. If you look and select carefully, you can find some
good buys here.
Cigars
Many cigar aficionados come to the Tropique International Smoke
Shop (in Wyndham Nassau Resort & Crystal Palace Casino, West Bay
Street; % 242-327-7292) to indulge their passion for Cubans, which are
handpicked and imported by Bahamian merchants. The staff at this
outlet trained in Havana, so they know their cigars.
Remember, the United States prohibits the importation of Cuban cigars
because of the trade embargo. If you buy them, you’re supposed to
enjoy them in The Bahamas.
Coins and stamps
At the Bahamas Post Office Philatelic Bureau (in the General Post
Office at the top of Parliament Street on East Hill Street; % 242-322-
1112), you find beautiful Bahamian stamps slated to become collector’s
items. One of the most sought-after stamps has a seashell motif.
Coin of the Realm (Charlotte Street, just off Bay Street; % 242-322-
4497) is a family-run shop located in a lovely building hewn out of solid
limestone over 200 years ago. The shop offers not only fine jewelry, but
Chapter 13: Having Fun On and Off the Beach in New Providence 177

also mint and used Bahamian and British postage stamps and rare (and
not-so-rare) Bahamian silver and gold coins. It also sells old and modern
Bahamian paper currency.
Fashion
One of Nassau’s more formal and elegant clothing stores, Barry’s
Limited (Bay and George streets; % 242-322-3118) sells garments made
from lamb’s wool and English cashmere. Elegant sportswear (including
Korean-made guayabera shirts) and suits are sold here. Most of the
clothes are for men, but women often stop in for a look at the fancy
handmade Irish linen handkerchiefs and the stylish cuff links, studs, and
other accessories. Bonneville Bones (Bay Street; % 242-328-0804) is
the best men’s store we’ve found in Nassau. You can find everything
from standard T-shirts and designer jeans to suits here. Cole’s of Nassau
(Parliament Street; % 242-322-8393) offers the most extensive selec-
tion of designer fashions in Nassau. Women can buy everything from
swimwear and formal gowns to sportswear and hosiery. Cole’s also sells
gift items, sterling-silver designer and costume jewelry, hats, shoes,
bags, scarves, and belts.
Fendi (Charlotte Street at Bay Street; % 242-322-6300) is Nassau’s only
outlet for the well-crafted, Italian-inspired accessories endorsed by this
famous leather-goods company. With handbags, luggage, shoes, watches,
cologne, wallets, and portfolios to choose from, the selection may well
solve some of your gift-giving quandaries.
Handicrafts
Sea Grape Boutique (West Bay Road, next to Travelers Rest; % 242-327-
5113) is the finest gift shop on New Providence, with a fascinating inven-
tory of exotic decorative items. It includes jewelry crafted from fossilized
coral (sometimes with sharks’ teeth embedded inside), beadwork from
Guatemala, Haitian paintings, silver from India, hairbrushes shaped like
parrots, and clothing that’s well-suited to the sometimes steamy climate
of The Bahamas. A second branch of this outfit, Sea Grape, Too, is
located in the Radisson Hotel’s Mall, on Cable Beach (% 242-327-5113).
Jewelry
The jewelry department at John Bull (corner of Bay and Charlotte streets;
% 242-322-4253) offers classic selections from Tiffany & Co.; cultured
pearls from Mikimoto; the creations of David Yurman, Stephen Lagos,
Carrera y Carrera, and Sea Life by Kanbana; Greek and Roman coin jew-
elry; and Spanish gold and silver pieces. John Bull is the best name in
the business. The store also features a wide selection of watches, cam-
eras, perfumes (including Estée Lauder, Chanel, and Calvin Klein at dis-
count prices — though you should check carefully to make sure that
you’re getting a bargain), cosmetics, leather goods, and accessories. This
store is one of the best places in The Bahamas to buy a Gucci or Cartier

watch. The outlet has been the authorized agent for Rolex in The Bahamas
for 30 years, and the store itself has been doing business since 1929.
Leather
In addition to the stores mentioned in this section, another good store
for leather goods is the Brass and Leather Shop, which we describe in
the “Brass and copper” section earlier in this chapter.
Gucci (Saffrey Square on Bay Street; % 242-325-0561), is the best place
to buy leather goods in Nassau. The wide selection includes handbags,
wallets, luggage, briefcases, gift items, scarves, ties, casual clothes,
evening wear for men and women, umbrellas, shoes, sandals, watches,
and perfume, all by Gucci of Italy.
The well-known retail outlet Leather Masters (Parliament Street; % 242-
322-7597) carries an internationally known collection of leather bags,
luggage, and accessories by Ted Lapidus, Lanvin, and Lancel of Paris;
Etienne Aigner of Germany; and i Santi of Italy. Leather Masters also car-
ries luggage by Piel and Marroquinera of Colombia; leather wallets by
Bosca; and pens, cigarette lighters, and watches by Colibri. The store
also sells silk scarves, neckties, and cigar accessories.
Linens
The Linen Shop (Ironmongery Building on Bay Street, near Charlotte
Street; % 242-322-4266) is the best outlet for linens in Nassau. It 
sells beautifully embroidered bed linens, Irish handkerchiefs, hand-
embroidered women’s blouses, and tablecloths. Look also for the most
exquisite children’s clothing and christening gowns in town.
Maps
Balmain Antiques (second floor of Mason’s Building on Bay Street, near
Charlotte Street; % 242-323-7421) offers a wide and varied assortment
of 19th-century etchings, engravings, and maps, many of them antique
and all reasonably priced. Other outlets have minor displays of these
collectibles, but this outlet has the finest. Some items are 400 years old.
Discussing your interests with Mr. Ramsey, the owner, is usually best so
that he can direct you to the proper drawers. His specialties include The
Bahamas, America during the Civil War, and black history. He also has a
collection of historical military items.
Markets
The Nassau International Bazaar (from Bay Street down to the water-
front, near Prince George Wharf) consists of some 30 shops selling inter-
national goods in a new arcade. The $1.8-million complex sells goods
from around the globe. With cobbled alleyways and garretted store-
fronts, the area looks like a European village, making it a pleasant place
for browsing.
Chapter 13: Having Fun On and Off the Beach in New Providence 179

Prince George Plaza (Bay Street) is popular with cruise-ship passen-
gers. Many fine shops, such as Gucci, are located here. When you get
tired of shopping, you can eat at one of the several nearby restaurants
and cafes.
The Straw Market occupies a tent on Bay Street, opposite the intersec-
tion of Bay Street with George Street. Hours of the Straw Market are daily
from 7 a.m. to around 8 p.m., although each individual vendor (there are
around 200 of them) sets his or her own hours. Merchandise includes
hats, weavings, baskets, valises, and more, all woven from reeds, straw,
and grasses.
Perfumes and cosmetics
Nassau has several good perfume outlets that also stock a lot of nonper-
fume merchandise.
 The Beauty Spot: The largest cosmetic shop in The Bahamas, this
outlet sells duty-free cosmetics by Lancôme, Chanel, Yves Saint
Laurent, Elizabeth Arden, Estée Lauder, Clinique, Prescriptives, and
Biotherm, among others. It also operates facial salons. Bay and

useful if island fever overtakes you after you return home.
Living It Up After Dark
Nassau, Cable Beach, and Paradise Island were designed for party time.
After dark, the bars at the larger hotels and at plenty of restaurants are
packed. Vacationers and residents bump hips on the crowded dance

floors of local nightclubs. For many visitors, the casinos are the focal
point of nightlife — and for some, day life as well.
The newer of New Providence’s dynamic duo, the casino complex at
Atlantis Paradise Island Resort (% 242-363-3000) is the largest in the
Caribbean. Craps tables, baccarat, blackjack, roulette, Caribbean stud
poker, and more than 1,000 slot machines give you plenty of excuses to
try your luck. Tables are open from 10 a.m. to 4 a.m. daily, and the one-
arm bandits are ready round-the-clock. Also on-site and drawing a party
crowd is Dragons Night Club, open from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m.
The Crystal Palace Casino (% 242-327-6200) lies between the Wyndham
Nassau and Radisson resorts on Cable Beach. Tables are open from 
10 a.m. to 4 a.m. during the week, and 24 hours a day on weekends. Slot
machines, of course, are willing to eat your coins anytime, day or night.
If you’re craving a real slice of local life, find out what’s happening at the
Dundas Center for the Performing Arts (on Mackey Street in Nassau;
% 242-393-3728). These plays and musicals, put on by local or foreign
performers, give you a taste of Nassau’s artsy scene.
Club Fluid, West Bay Street, near the corner of Frederick Street (% 242-
356-4691), is set within a two-story building in downtown Nassau. This
basement-level nightclub features a baby-blue and white interior, dozens
of mirrors, two bars, and a dance floor. It attracts an animated crowd of
local residents, ranging in age from about 20 to 45, who appreciate the
reggae, soca, hip-hop, and R&B music. It opens Wednesday to Saturday
from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m., with a cover ranging from $12 to $20.
Señor Frog, West Bay Street, near the British Colonial Hilton (% 242-
323-1777), is a hard-to-hate bar, restaurant, cafe, and taco joint that man-
ages to satirize itself. The interior is deliberately and somewhat claustro-
phobically overcrowded with references to Latino music, frogs, faux
palm trees, and battered wooden tables that have hosted all kinds of
food and beverage service — from midday salsa and chips to “Let’s
sample all of the best margaritas available on this menu” contests con-
ducted informally among heavy-drinking cruise-ship drop-ins. Expect
merengue music (especially on weekends, when tables are pushed aside
to form an ersatz dance floor); a color scheme of orange, brown, and
terra cotta; and a menu loaded with, among other choices, burgers, faji-
tas, and tacos.
The Living Room, in the Nassau Beach Hotel, West Bay Street (% 242-
327-7711), is located on the cellar level of the also-recommended hotel
and is an earth-toned, stone-trimmed bar and disco that has welcomed
during its long and suds-soaked life celebrities such as Diana Ross and
Lenny Kravitz. Outfitted with low-slung sofas and armchairs in a style
you may associate with someone’s private living room, it has a convivial
bar area and a dance floor which can, as evenings progress, become ani-
mated and a lot of fun. Open Tuesday to Sunday 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Chapter 13: Having Fun On and Off the Beach in New Providence 181

Entrance is free for guests of the Nassau Beach Hotel, with a cover
charge of between $10 and $15 per person for everyone else.
Going Beyond Nassau
Tour operators take vacationers to the two most popular offshore cays,
activity-packed Blue Lagoon Island and the more tranquil Rose Island.
You decide whether you want to be in a small, personalized group or
part of a huge crowd that descends on one of these peaceful islands.
Trip #1: Rose Island respite
Remote Rose Island is a sliver of land poking up out of the sea northeast
of the Prince George waterfront docks of Nassau. Shelling is one of the
lures of this little islet. If you want to escape the crowds of Nassau, you
can take a boat, the Robinson Crusoe, which leaves Wednesday, Friday,
and Sunday at 10 a.m. from Nassau and returns at 4:30 p.m. The cost is
$50, $25 for children ages 2 to 11, and free for kids under 5. You can relax
in a hammock, snorkel among the coral reefs, and enjoy the white sand
beach before and after your sizzling barbecue lunch with unlimited white
wine (included in the price). Bookings for this island retreat trip are
available through Majestic Tours (% 242-322-2606; www.majestic
holidays.com).
Trip #2: A sail to Exuma
If you want to see the Exuma island chain on a daylong excursion, try 
the Fantastic Exuma Powerboat Adventure. The boat departs Nassau
Harbour at 9 a.m. and arrives in the Exuma Cays about an hour later.
Stops include snorkeling at a private cay (Ship Channel), a visit with the
iguanas on Allan’s Cay, feeding stingrays along the shore, and a barbe-
cue lunch. A full bar is available all day, and the drinks are free. The cost
is $190, or $120 for children 2 to 12. Transportation from a participant’s
hotel to the port of embarkation is included in the price. The experience
comes to a conclusion around 5pm. For more information and prices,
contact Powerboat Adventures (% 242-393-7116; www.powerboat
adventures.com).

Chapter 14
Settling into Grand Bahama
In This Chapter
 Knowing what to expect when you get to Grand Bahama
 Getting around Grand Bahama
G
rand Bahama was the dream of Virginian financier Wallace Groves,
who envisioned it as a miniature Miami Beach. Today, with its high-
rise hotels, golf courses, marinas, international bazaars for shopping,
bevy of Continental restaurants, and golden-sand beaches, that dream
has been realized. Grand Bahama is the second-most popular tourist
destination in The Bahamas, rivaled only by Nassau and Paradise Island.
It’s the northernmost and the fourth-largest landmass in The Bahamas,
stretching for 188km (73 miles).
Both Freeport and Lucaya lack the upscale chicness of Paradise Island
or even Nassau, but they do have fabulous beaches. The affordable
hotels and restaurants make Freeport and Lucaya the preferred destina-
tions for middle-class families (as opposed to the high rollers who are
attracted to Cable Beach and Paradise Island). Lucaya was developed
about a decade later than Freeport, but today the tourist facilities of the
two major resort areas have more or less merged into an indistinguish-
able whole.
Grand Bahama is so big that many areas remain unspoiled, especially in
the West End or the East End, which host very few resorts or restau-
rants. You can also get close to nature at the Rand Memorial Nature
Centre and the Garden of the Groves. And the Lucayan National Park,
with its underwater caves, forest trails, and a secluded beach, is another
major attraction for adventurous travelers.
Arriving at the Airport
Although some people arrive in cruise ships, most visitors swoop down
on Grand Bahama in planes. Getting through Freeport International
Airport (% 242-352-2052) is generally quite easy. Upon your arrival,
you’re launched into your vacation with the sound of live calypso or
reggae music.

Navigating your way through 
passport control and Customs
With your passport (or birth certificate and photo ID), return airline
ticket, and a completed Immigration Arrival/Departure Card, get in the
shortest visitors’ line. Hold on to your copy of the immigration card
because you need to present it before leaving The Bahamas.
The well-marked airport is easy to navigate. You collect your baggage
and declare that you haven’t brought in any contraband. Customs offi-
cials may or may not open your luggage to confirm your claim. You can
then pick up maps and helpful brochures at the tourist information desk,
get some extra cash in U.S. dollars from an ATM, and head for the exit.
Getting from the airport to your hotel
Metered taxis greet each flight, ready to whisk vacationers off to hotels.
(The cabdriver lobby is powerful enough to ban buses at the airport, so
you have to rely on a taxi.) Depending on where you are going, the cost
ranges from $11 to $20. Downtown Freeport is only a five-minute ride
from the airport; Lucaya, the beach resort area, is a ten-minute ride.
If your vacation package includes hotel transfers, present your voucher
to the driver of a van that’s clearly marked to go to your hotel. If you
want to explore Grand Bahama at your own pace, you can pick up a
rental car at the airport (see “Getting Around Grand Bahama” later in
this chapter).
Cruising into Grand Bahama
Freeport is a popular port of call for major cruise ships. If you opt for
one of these floating resorts, expect limited time ashore.
On Grand Bahama Island, your cruise ship will dock at a dull industrial-
looking wasteland on the western part of the island, far removed from
the center of all the action at Freeport or Lucaya. For shopping, sightsee-
ing, the best beaches, or gambling, you must take a $10 taxi ride over to
the resort areas. Taxis await all arriving cruise ships.
Part IV: Grand Bahama 
186
Island hopping
If you want to visit some other islands while on Grand Bahama, you can do so aboard
Major’s Airlines, a small commuter-type airline that flies out of Freeport International
Airport (% 242-352-5778). This Major’s offers regular flights to Bimini for $140 round-
trip; to Abaco for $160 round-trip; to Andros for $220 round-trip; and to Eleuthera for
$230 round-trip. Most of its carriers transport 9 to 15 passengers. Flights aren’t avail-
able every day, so call for schedules, reservations, and other information.

Choosing Your Location
Because Freeport is a 15-minute bus ride from the beach, Lucaya has
become much more popular, and has all but put Freeport out of busi-
ness. At press time, the focal point of Freeport, the mammoth Crowne
Plaza Golf Resort & Casino, lies rotting in the sun waiting for a devel-
oper with millions to take it over. But there are still a few hotels in
Freeport, some less expensive than those in Lucaya. 
Freeport’s once-great shopping mecca, the International Bazaar is look-
ing a little tired these days, and the Port Lucaya Marketplace is giving it
a run for its money. Many of the major stores at the International Bazaar
also opened branches at the Port Lucaya Marketplace, charging the
same prices for the same kinds of merchandise.
Although both Freeport and Lucaya have plenty of good places to leave
your money, we prefer leaving our money at Port Lucaya because of its
gingerbread-trimmed, wooden buildings and the live music heard most
evenings in Count Basie Square.
Even if you stay in Freeport, you can still sample Lucaya’s attractions —
buses, minivans, and taxis connect these resort areas. Neither area is far
from Grand Bahama’s golf courses, horse stables, and natural attrac-
tions, such as Garden of the Groves, Rand Memorial Nature Center,
and Lucayan National Park. Check out Chapter 3 for more background
info on — and a map of — this location.
Getting Around Grand Bahama
Whether you board a bus, catch a taxi, mount a motor scooter, pedal a
bike, or walk, getting to the most interesting parts of this island is rela-
tively easy. For the most flexibility, you can rent a car, although you
don’t need one to get around.
Exploring by foot
Nearly devoid of hills, Grand Bahama Island is good for long strolls
because outside Freeport and Lucaya, it’s largely undeveloped.
Flourishing botanical gardens and nature reserves, such as Lucayan
National Park and Bahamas National Trust Rand Nature Centre, are
prime locales for hoofing it. For guided nature hikes, contact Kayak
Nature Tours (% 242-373-2485). If human-made wonders are more to
your liking, the International Bazaar and its surroundings in Freeport
and the Port Lucaya Marketplace and its Lucaya seaside neighborhood
are best for a shopper’s stroll.
Taking a bus
Grand Bahama’s public bus service, run by privately licensed minivans,
makes getting around Freeport and Lucaya almost hassle-free. You 
Chapter 14: Settling into Grand Bahama 187

typically wait five to seven minutes at any given stop. Sometimes vans
sit longer because drivers often don’t leave until they have a minimum
number of passengers. The fare is $1 for adults and 50¢ for children, and
drivers request exact change, either in U.S. or Bahamian money. When
you board, tell the driver your destination.
Taking a taxi
The majority of taxis are limousines. The government sets fares and
requires cabs to have working meters, but many drivers don’t turn them
on for routine trips; instead, they quote you a flat fare. If you’re not sure
what the approximate cost of a taxi ride should be, ask someone at your
hotel desk before you leave. One or two passengers pay $3 for the first
kilometer (3⁄4 mile) and 40¢ for each additional half-kilometer (1⁄4 mile).
Each additional passenger over the age of 3 costs a flat fee of $2, and for
each piece of luggage beyond two, the driver collects 50¢. Taxis wait out-
side hotels, restaurants, and attractions and cruise the streets, where
you can flag them down. Two reliable companies to call are Freeport
Taxi (% 242-352-6666) and G.B. Taxi Union (% 242-352-7101).
Driving around
Unlike Nassau, driving on Grand Bahama, with its long, broad roads, is
easy. A car comes in handy if you’d rather not rely on taxis and mini-
vans. Much of the island is undeveloped, so heavy traffic isn’t a problem,
and you can easily find places to park. Like the British, islanders drive
on the left.
You can find car-rental companies around Freeport International Airport.
Cars begin at $50 a day, jeeps at $70, and vans at $120. Availability varies,
so if you haven’t made a reservation before you arrive, you may have to
call around until you find the size or type of car that you want. The major
companies are Avis (% 242-352-7666), Dollar (% 242-352-9325), and
Hertz (% 242-352-9250).
Other fun ways to get around
Mopeds and minibikes may seem like an ideal way to get around Grand
Bahama. But if you’re used to driving on the right side of the road, a 
miscalculation while riding a moped on the left here can end up being
painful. If you’re willing to risk it, plan on spending about $15 for the first
hour, plus $5 for each additional hour, or $40 to $55 a day. You need to
have a valid driver’s license and leave your credit card or $100 cash as a
deposit. Wearing helmets — provided with each rental — is mandatory.
You can make arrangements to rent through your hotel or at one of the
scooter rental shops you see near gas stations and other spots along the
road. If you arrive on Grand Bahama by cruise ship, you can rent motor
scooters at Freeport Harbour.
Grand Bahama’s pancake-flat topography makes bicycling an attractive
option. As you’re whizzing by (riding on the left side of the road), the
Part IV: Grand Bahama 
188

breeze can mask the sun’s power, so be sure to slather on plenty of sun-
block. Wearing a brimmed hat is also a good idea. Some hotels offer
complimentary bikes, while other accommodations, along with roadside
bike-rental outfits, let you rent one for $15 to $20 a day. See Chapter 17
for more on biking and other activities in Grand Bahama.

Hospitals
Government-run Rand Memorial Hospital
(% 242-352-6735) is on East Atlantic Drive.
For information about a clinic close to your
hotel, call the hospital or ask the staff at
your accommodations. Before you leave
home, check your health insurance to see
whether you’re covered while traveling
abroad. If you’re not, you may want to pur-
chase a traveler’s insurance plan with
emergency medical expense coverage
(see Chapter 9 for details).
Information
You can find tourist information desks at
the airport, the International Bazaar, Port

open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to
5:30 p.m.
Restrooms
Public toilets are available at the airport
and at the International Bazaar, as well as
the Port Lucaya Marketplace. Except for
Xanadu Beach at Lucaya, don’t expect any
of the other more remote beaches on island
to have public toilets.
Safety
Freeport and Lucaya are usually safe, as
long as you take the same precautions you
would anywhere else in the world: Don’t
venture into deserted areas alone, espe-
cially at night, and be discreet with your
money, jewelry, and other valuables.
Traveling by the island’s privately run mini-
vans is safe.
Taxis
Although all taxis have meters, many drivers
don’t use them. Rates for two passengers
are $3 for the first kilometer (3⁄4 mile), plus
40¢ for each additional half-kilometer 
(1⁄4 mile); additional passengers over age 3
cost a flat fee of $2. If you have more than
two pieces of luggage, each additional
piece costs 50¢. Taxis are easy to come 
by, but if you’d like to call one, try Freeport
Taxi (% 242-352-6666) or G.B. Taxi Union
(% 242-352-7101).

Chapter 15
Staying in Style in 
Grand Bahama
In This Chapter
 Deciding where to stay
 Evaluating the top choices
I
n this chapter, we describe the accommodations that appeal to most
first-time visitors. We considered locations, amenities, quality of serv-
ice, architecture, and proximity to Grand Bahama’s best attractions.
Surveying the Scene
Here you have a choice of more than 4,000 bedrooms or suites, ranging
from simple double bedrooms common to most American roadside
motels to one- or two-bedroom condo units of timeshares, some of
which may be someone else’s vacation home when she is off island.
Of course, you have your choice of sprawling resorts, just as you do on
Paradise Island (prices, however, are cheaper on Grand Bahama). Many
of these resorts offer various meal plans. The cost is usually less expen-
sive if you book in on half-board terms (that is, breakfast and dinner),
leaving you free to have lunch somewhere else during your exploration
of the island.
If you want a beachfront location, opt for Lucaya. If gambling and shop-
ping are more important to you, a hotel in Freeport may be just fine. For
escapists, you can find some resorts in the distant East End, away from
everything but those white sandy beaches.
Rack rates are for two people spending one night during the high season
of winter and spring, unless we indicate otherwise. Rack rates simply
mean published rates, but you can often do better (see Chapter 7 for
details). Room rates at all-inclusive resorts include not only all meals
and beverages, but also tips, taxes, transportation to and from the air-
port, and most activities and entertainment.

Grand Bahama Island abounds in package deals appealing to honey-
mooners, golfers, gamblers, scuba divers, and others. The best deals are
offered from mid-April to mid-December.
The Best Accommodations
Here are our top hotel picks on Grand Bahama Island.
Best Western Castaways Resort & Suites
$$
Freeport
The 118-room Castaways is a modest and unassuming hotel despite its excel-
lent position adjacent to the International Bazaar and the casino. Guests
stay here because of its location and low price. The hotel isn’t on the beach,
but a free shuttle can take you to nearby Williams Town Beach or Xanadu
Beach. Gardens surround the four-story hotel, and the hotel has a pagoda
roof and an indoor/outdoor garden lobby with shops, a game room, and tour
desks. Rooms are a basic motel style, and the best units are on the ground.
The hotel has a large, unheated freshwater pool with a wide terrace and a
pool bar that offers sandwiches and cool drinks. The Flamingo Restaurant
features unremarkable Bahamian and American dishes. The Yellow Bird
Show Club stays open until 3 a.m. and features limbo dancers and fire-eaters
Monday through Saturday. A children’s playground adjoins the pool.

stay free in parent’s room. AE, MC, V.
Island Palm Resort
$
Freeport
Set within the commercial heart of Freeport, this 143-unit three-story motel
consists of four buildings separated by parking lots and greenery. Within an
easy walk from virtually everything in town, and 2km (11⁄4 miles) from the
International Bazaar, it offers good value in no-frills, eminently serviceable
rooms with well-kept bathrooms equipped with shower/tub combinations.
Complimentary shuttle-bus service ferries anybody who’s interested to
nearby Williamstown Beach (also called Island Seas Beach), where you can
use the beachfront facilities (including jet skis and snorkeling equipment)
of its sibling resort, a timeshare unit known as Island Sea.
See map p. 194. E. Mall Drive (P.O. Box F-44881), Freeport. % 242-352-6648. Fax:

person $15. AE, DISC, MC, V.
Pelican Bay at Lucaya
$$–$$$
Lucaya
On a peninsula jutting into a series of inland waterways, this hotel has
more architectural charm than any other on the island, evoking a Danish
Part IV: Grand Bahama 
192

seaside village. Located next door to the Underwater Explorers Society
(UNEXSO), the 69-unit Pelican Bay attracts scuba divers. Lucaya’s finest
beach is across the road. Town house–style buildings, trimmed with white
latticework and gingerbread, are painted in earth tones. Each large unit has
a wet bar and bathrobes. Balconies offer vistas of the marina, waterway,
whirlpool, or two large, unheated freshwater pools. For the breeziest stay,
request one of the end rooms that offer cross-ventilation. The older rooms
look out on the marina, while the newer deluxe units overlook the bay.
If you dine at the Ferry House Restaurant, which is just a brief stroll away,
you can charge the excellent meals to your room. Along the marina, a pas-
sageway leads directly to Port Lucaya Marketplace and the watersports
vendors. Don’t take this route if you’ve had a few Goombay Smashes or
Bahama Mamas; the walkway has no outer wall or railing, so you could fall
right into the water.
See map p. 194. Royal Palm Way, by Port Lucaya Marketplace and UNEXSO, the dive
operator. % 800-600-9192 or 242-373-9550. Fax: 242-373-9551. www.pelicanbay
hotel.com. Rack rates: $145–$200 double, $250 suite. Rates include breakfast. AE,
MC, V.
Port Lucaya Resort and Yacht Club
$$
Lucaya
With its own 50-slip marina, this 163-room hotel and yacht club attracts
boaters and shoppers. Despite being adjacent to Port Lucaya Marketplace,
the resort is surprisingly tranquil and has a secluded feel. Buildings one
through six are the quietest because they’re removed from the music and
bustle of the marketplace. Deluxe rooms overlook the marina, and the tidy,
well-maintained bathrooms have adequate shelf space. An Olympic-size,
unheated freshwater pool is set off by a whirlpool, and you can sip a drink
from the poolside Tiki Bar. Plenty of watersports are at or near the hotel,
and you can reach the beach by walking across the road and through the
huge Lucayan resort. If you’re traveling with children, consider dropping
them off at Our Lucaya’s Camp Lucaya (see the review of the Westin &
Sheraton at Our Lucaya later in this section). The Trade Winds Café, Port
Lucaya Resort’s main restaurant, serves standard fare at breakfast and
dinner, but you can find far better and more varied dining options at the
nearby marketplace.

Ritz Beach Resort
$$
Lucaya
Enveloped by semitropical gardens, the Ritz (not related to the other
fabled hotel chain) is adjacent to the Pirates of The Bahamas Theme Park.
The origins of this resort date back to 1995. The resort is made up of two
buildings, and it also embraces a 50-room complex called Coral Suites. All

the bedrooms are in concrete coral buildings, and your options range from
efficiency and studio units to one-bedroom suites to elaborate villa and pent-
house accommodations. The bedrooms are spacious and well furnished.
Your amenities depend on how much you want to pay. Penthouses are
located on the third and fourth levels; one multilevel studio penthouse
comes with its own sun deck and private pool. The hotel’s eating facilities
are actually at the Taino Beach Vacation Club, where guests can patronize
two international restaurants and five bars. The Ritz also has a pool bar.

Viva Wyndham Fortuna Beach
$$$$
Lucaya
Evoking an Italian version of a Club Med, this property sits on 11 hectares
(26 acres) in front of one of the island’s best white sand beaches. Although
the Viva Wyndham welcomes families and hosts a children’s program,
most vacationers here are young couples. This European-owned resort has
a definite Italian accent. You hear more ciaos than hellos. Guests play
bocce ball on the beach and dine on Italian and some Bahamian cuisine.
Because of its strong Continental overlay, the cuisine is better here than
at your typical Grand Bahama hotel.
Not far from the Bahamas National Trust Rand Memorial Nature Centre
and Lucayan National Park, this beach resort has a one-size-fits-all price
tag. You don’t need to dig into your pocket for food, drinks, nightly enter-
tainment, or most activities, although you have to pay extra for scuba
diving, fishing, water-skiing, and horseback riding. Six kilometers (4 miles)
from Lucaya and 10km (6 miles) from Freeport, this resort is an attractive
getaway. More than half the comfortable rooms have views of the water
while the others overlook the gardens. If you want accommodations in an
isolated setting, you won’t mind staying here and having to rent a car to
explore the rest of the island.

Westin Grand Bahama Island at Our Lucaya Resort & Sheraton
Grand Bahama Island at Our Lucaya Resort
$$$–$$$$
Lucaya
This massive $400-million resort, one of the largest in The Bahamas and by
far the finest, most appealing, and best-accessorized on Grand Bahama
Island, is firmly anchored beside one of the best white sandy beaches in
The Bahamas — Lucayan Beach.
Part IV: Grand Bahama 
196

The first of the resort’s three sections was completed in 1998 as the
Sheraton Grand Bahama Island at Our Lucaya Resort. With a vague South
Beach Art Deco design, it’s laid out like a massive, open-sided, stone-
trimmed hexagon, with about half of the rooms facing the beach and the
swimming pool, the other half facing the gardens. The 513-room resort is
contemporary but relaxed, drawing a high percentage of families.
Bedrooms are whimsical and fun, thanks to fabrics you’d expect on a loud
Hawaiian shirt from the Elvis era.
In 2000, two newer, more upscale, and more cutting-edge subdivisions of
Our Lucaya were opened next door. The smaller and somewhat more pri-
vate of the two is Westin Lighthouse Pointe, a 322-unit, low-rise condo and
timeshare complex that focuses specifically on an adult clientele. Its larger
counterpart, and the one we find the most appealing, is the 536-unit Westin
Breakers Cay, a ten-story, white-sided tower whose edges curve sinuously
in a postmodern S-curve beside the beach. Each of this complex’s three
subsections, along with a convention center and well-equipped health,
spa, and exercise facility, stretch like pearls in a necklace along a narrow
strip of beachfront. Also on-site, within a two-story compound flanking the
sea, is The Lanai, which comprises 23 sprawling two-bedroom suites, each
furnished in colonial Caribbean style. The complex contains an impressive
diversity of restaurants, each designed with a different theme and ambi-
ence. Each of the subdivisions has a swimming pool. The Sheraton at Our
Lucaya’s pool seems to flow around a replica of a 19th-century sugar mill,
complete with an aqueduct worthy of the ancient Romans. And the Westin
at Our Lucaya is separated from the powder-white sands of Lucaya Beach
by a trio of lap pools, each 15m (49 ft.) long and 1.2m (4 ft.) deep, whose
edges replicate the sinuous S-shape of the hotel’s footprint.
A spa and fitness center, a quartet of tennis courts, a convention center, a
state-of-the-art casino (The Isle of Capri — at press time the only func-
tioning casino on Grand Bahama Island), and an upscale shopping mall
have been added in recent years, and there’s an increasing emphasis on
golf, thanks to the opening of the Reef Course (p. 222).
Children aged 2 to 12 can be amused and entertained throughout daylight
hours every day at The Bahamas’ best-run children’s venue, Camp Lucaya.

Xanadu Beach Resort & Marina
$$$
Xanadu Beach
Permeated with one of the most quirky and idiosyncratic histories of any
hotel in The Bahamas, this 186-room hotel is radically different from the
way it was when it housed the reclusive billionaire Howard Hughes.
Despite storm damages in 2004 and 2005 and all kinds of setbacks, Xanadu
Chapter 15: Staying in Style in Grand Bahama 197

is back, soaring triumphantly above a scrub-dotted landscape that’s criss-
crossed with canals and upscale villas. Despite negative fortunes and a
hotel scene that has shifted to an increasing degree away from Freeport
and toward Port Lucaya, Xanadu has hung on, struggling to provide serv-
ice and comfort to visitors. Much of the allure of Xanadu today is the result
of the hard work and devotion of the Donato family. It benefited in 2005
from a big influx of cash that reconfigured the lobby area into a fantasy of
the Spanish baroque. Regrettably, however, there’s a sense that this place
is still barely clinging to economic viability. Damage to the roofline and
some of the balustrades remain in need of repair. Bedrooms, however, are
comfortable and the nearby beach is sandy, inviting, and alluring, even
though many of the beachfront structures need rebuilding.

Dining Out in Grand
Bahama
In This Chapter
 Finding the best food beyond your hotel dining room
 Discovering restaurants with island ambience
M
ost restaurants in Freeport and Lucaya don’t give your wallet as
much of a workout as those in Nassau and Paradise Island. You
don’t have as many dining options either, but from fast food to fine food,
the choices of locales and cuisine are plentiful enough. Menus spotlight
locally caught seafood and typical Bahamian dishes, but you also find
the usual array of international fare. Restaurants import nearly all food-
stuffs, especially meats, fruits, and vegetables.
Have a casual lunch at a waterside cafe, followed by an elegant candlelit
dinner at a hotel. Or try an unassuming, family-run spot that specializes
in Bahamian favorites. Islanders head to the rustic restaurants and bars
in the West End for the freshest — and cheapest — snapper, jack fish,
grouper, conch, and other local seafood. Sunday night is party night in
the West End. The trip is a 40km (25-mile) drive from Freeport by taxi or
rental car.
The East End begins east of the Lucayan National Park, 45km (28 miles)
east of Freeport/Lucaya at the settlement of High Rock. Only the adven-
turous escape the resort-studded Freeport/Lucaya area and venture into
this sparsely inhabited section for lunch while they’re driving around
the island. Don’t expect any fancy dining — just some local eateries
serving Bahamian favorites with homemade goodness. And, yes, a view
of the sea.
Getting a Taste for Grand Bahama
Grand Bahama chefs aim for international appeal, turning out the usual
array of food to please everybody: pasta, barbecued ribs, burgers, even
quesadillas, souvlaki, sushi, or Wiener schnitzels. Early-bird specials and
festive happy hours with discounted drinks lure patrons to various

spots. Some Freeport and Lucaya restaurants open only for dinner, and
some close between meals; so even when reservations aren’t necessary,
you may want to call before going out of your way.
See the Introduction at the beginning of the book for an explanation of
the price categories used in this chapter. For details about Bahamian
specialties, turn to Chapter 2.
Dining at Grand Bahama’s Best Restaurants
Beckey’s Restaurant & Lounge
$–$$
Freeport
BAHAMIAN
Beckey’s culinary creations make you think that you’ve stumbled into a
Bahamian home. No matter what time of day you get to this friendly dining
spot, you can order fluffy pancakes, scrambled eggs, or local breakfast
favorites, such as stew fish or boil fish (fish cooked with salt pork, onions,
and green peppers) with grits. For lunch or dinner, the steamed snapper,
pan-fried grouper, or cracked conch are island favorites that are prepared
with zest. We prefer the local specialties instead of the regular American-
style food. The bartender makes a Beckey’s Special, a lips-to-hips concoc-
tion of coconut rum and vanilla ice cream with a splash of brandy. During
happy hour, complimentary conch fritters come with the two-for-one
mixed drinks. Beckey’s is just across from Hydroflora Garden, about a five-
minute drive from the International Bazaar.
See map p. 202. East Sunrise Highway at East Beach Drive. % 242-352-5247.
Breakfast: $5–$11. Main courses: $7–$25. AE, MC, V. Open: Daily 7 a.m.–10 p.m.
Bishop’s Restaurant
$
East End
BAHAMIAN
For down-home dishes, known mainly by locals, this establishment is an
East End favorite. The restaurant opens onto views of the sea. Far from the
high-rise hotels, this little restaurant and lounge is reminiscent of The
Bahamas of the 1920s and ’30s. It serves some of the best cracked conch
we’ve sampled on Grand Bahama Island; the cooks roll the conch in a light
batter and fry it in piping-hot oil so that its crust is slightly crunchy. Another
favorite that’s always on the menu is fried grouper with classic peas and
rice. Or, for a savory dish, order the chicken barbecued in zesty sauce.
See map p. 202. High Rock. % 242-353-4515. Main courses: $10–$18. AE, MC, V. Open:
Daily 9 a.m.–7 p.m.
China Temple
$
International Bazaar
CHINESE
This Chinese joint also offers takeout. Over the years, this food has proved
to be the dining bargain of the bazaar. The menu is familiar and standard:
chop suey, chow mein, and sweet-and-sour dishes. The food’s certainly
Part IV: Grand Bahama 
200

not gourmet Asian fare, but it’s cheap and it may hit the spot when you
crave something different.
See map p. 202. International Bazaar. % 242-352-5610. Lunch main courses: $7–$9;
dinner main courses: $10–$14. AE, MC, V. Open: Mon–Sat 10:30 a.m.–10 p.m.
Churchill’s
$$$$
Lucaya
AMERICAN
One of the island’s most elegant and formal restaurants is imbued with a
vague sense of the faded grandeur of what used to be known as the British
Empire. Surpassed only by the Ferry House and Luciano’s, both of which
are recommended below, Churchill’s lures diners from other parts of
Grand Bahama Island to a dining room that opens onto the lobby of the
Westin Hotel at Our Lucaya. The venue includes a British-colonial bar with
dark wood floor and trim, potted plants, ceiling fans, a grand piano, and
big-windowed views over the sea. This is the island’s best chophouse, fea-
turing both succulent steaks flown over from the mainland and locally
caught seafood. The manor-house setting is an appropriate foil for the
finely honed service and top-quality ingredients, deftly prepared.
Regrettably, it’s open less frequently than we’d like, sometimes operating
only on weekends, and only at dinner, during low and shoulder season. 
See map p. 202. At the Westin & Sheraton at Our Lucaya Resorts, Royal Palm Way.
% 242-373-1333. Reservations required. Main courses: $26–$65. AE, DC, DISC, MC,

pancy levels of the hotel.
Fatman’s Nephew
$–$$
Lucaya
BAHAMIAN
The next generation carries on the culinary tradition of the late Fatman, a
chef whose Grand Bahama restaurant once had countless loyalists. At this
newer location overlooking the Port Lucaya Marketplace Marina, the focus
is on seafood. You can sample various grilled or spicy Cajun-style fish or
try local favorites, such as cracked conch. On most days, you encounter
at least eight kinds of game fish, including wahoo and kingfish. The menu
features other island dishes, too, like curried chicken, daily specials, bur-
gers, and steaks. Sometimes an especially authentic dish appears on the
menu, such as Bahamian-style shark soup made from the flesh of ham-
merheads. Not every dish wins an award, but the place is an enduring
favorite. The casual atmosphere is idyllic for having drinks and appetizers
on the breezy terrace above the water.
See map p. 202. Port Lucaya Marketplace. % 242-373-8520. Main courses: $10–$38.

this dockside restaurant are always flung open, offering views of pleasure

premises. For breakfast, the Danish pastries are a treat. For lunch, you can
have an open-faced Danish sandwich piled with smoked salmon, herring,
or roast beef. You may also find filling salads and quesadillas. Icelandic
lamb may be on the menu at dinnertime, along with duck à l’orange and
butterflied or coconut shrimp. In addition to local fish (snapper, grouper,

Ask a native Bahamian where to go for the best local food, and chances

Run by an amiable family, Geneva’s serves up hefty portions of the kind of
home cooking you’d get from your own mother — if she were Bahamian.
Tender conch comes cracked, stewed, or in a savory chowder. Order your
grouper steamed, broiled, or pan-fried, and your thick pork chops steamed
or fried. Peas and rice is the best side dish.

ITALIAN/SEAFOOD
Tucked away in one of the pedestrian thoroughfares of the Port Lucaya
Marketplace, you find a yellow-sided clapboard house that opens into a
charming 38-seat Italian trattoria. The chefs (including head chef Giovanni
Colo) serve Italian-influenced dishes of local seafood, specializing in
seafood pasta (usually prepared only for two diners) and lobster. Giovanni
stamps each dish with his Italian verve and flavor, whether it’s Bahamian
conch, local seafood, or scampi. Dishes show off his precision and rock-
solid technique, exemplified by sirloin steak with fresh mushrooms, delec-
table shrimp scampi, and an extremely good spaghetti carbonara.

definite Continental flair; a creative kitchen; a polite, hardworking staff;
and a sense of Gemütlichkeit in the tropics. Tucked away into one corner,
the lavish bar area features esoteric liquors and liqueurs and an upscale
and stylish décor that you may have expected in a chic hideaway in Berlin.
The dining room is simpler. Designed as a foil for the cuisine, and not an
architectural statement in its own right, it’s outfitted with dark wood trim
and the kind of nautical décor that’s especially charming when the Atlantic
winds outside blow hard and cold. Its owners are not shy about publiciz-
ing their culinary ambitions. They serve one of the few white (as in New
England) styles of conch chowder we’ve seen in The Bahamas. Jumbo
cheeseburgers are appropriately juicy, but more appealing may be the
Delmonico steaks, veal chops with Provençal herbs, or shrimp Alfredo with
marinara-flavored pasta. Chilean sea bass poached in chardonnay-flavored
butter sauce is a specialty, as is something known as “lobster St-Jacques,”
wherein chunks of lobster are spooned over a bed of garlic-flavored mashed
potatoes, covered with cheese, and broiled.

Lucaya
CARIBBEAN
This is one of the newest restaurants at the Westin & Sheraton Hotels at
Our Lucaya, and as such, a team of food and beverage experts threw tons
of money and research into the appropriate blend of Caribbean tradition
and postmodern sales and marketing. The result reminds you of the dining
room of a massive colonial Caribbean manor house, replete with replicas
of pineapples (the region’s traditional symbol of hospitality), Rastafarian-
inspired paintings, and the kind of elaborately carved mahogany furniture
that may have graced the home of a 19th-century Caribbean planter. You
get an airy sense of spaciousness and old-fashioned, 19th-century dignity
and restraint. Menu items include lobster and grilled corn bisque, cracked
conch with spicy pick-a-pepper sauce and sweet-potato wedges, grilled sir-
loin steak with cumin and thyme, Caribbean-inspired shrimp scampi,
blackened grouper with fire-roasted peppers and pineapple sauce, and
tamarind-glazed hen. On your way in, check out the Bahamian Junkanoo
costume on display. It’s one of the most elaborate, most outrageous, and
most costly examples of its kind. Replete with sequins and mystical refer-
ences, it’s something of which the Bahamian staff here is genuinely proud.

garlic-infused escargot, or chilled melon with port. Inspired by classical
European recipes with some local flair thrown in, the seafood and meat
courses are uniformly excellent. We recommend the Bahamian grouper
filet with toasted almonds and lemon butter. Flambéed with cognac, the
scampi is another palate pleaser. The duckling breast comes in a green
peppercorn sauce, and the rack of lamb (served for two) is carved table-

Outrigger’s Native Restaurant/White Wave Club
$
Smith’s Point
BAHAMIAN
Cement-sided and simple, with a large deck extending out toward the sea,
this restaurant was here long before the construction of the nearby Port
Lucayan Marketplace, which lies only four blocks away. The restaurant
area is the domain of Gretchen Wilson, whose kitchens produce a rotating
series of dishes that include such lip-smacking dishes as lobster tails,
minced lobster, steamed or cracked conch, pork chops, chicken, fish, and
shrimp, usually served with peas ’n’ rice and macaroni. Every Wednesday
night, from 5 p.m. to 2 a.m., the restaurant is the venue for Outrigger’s
Famous Wednesday Night Fish Fry, when as many as a thousand diners
will line up for platters of fried or steamed fish, priced at $10 to $15 each.
A DJ and dancers round out the experience. Almost as well-attended are
the establishment’s Bonfire Nights, where set-price all-you-can eat barbe-
cued dinners go for $30 per person every Tuesday and Thursday evening
(you can also order à la carte). If you’re not looking for a meal, at any time
of the week you may consider stepping into the nearby ramshackle bar,
the White Wave Club.

dard fish and pork chops, chicken souse (an acquired taste), cracked
conch, sandwiches and hamburgers, and an array of daily specials.

Lucaya
BAHAMIAN/INTERNATIONAL
This restaurant is our favorite among the many in the Port Lucaya
Marketplace, and we’re seconded by a healthy mix of locals and yacht
owners who pack the place every weekend. Decorated with Tiffany-style
lamps and captain’s chairs, it boasts the most charming wait staff on
Grand Bahama Island. Lunches are relatively simple affairs, with fish and
chips, sandwiches, and salads. You can order pizzas anytime, and they’re
available in 21 varieties, including one with conch, lobster, shrimp, and
chicken. Dinners are more elaborate and better tasting, and you have a
choice of curries (including a version with conch); lobster in cream, wine,
and herb sauce; all kinds of fish and shellfish; and several kinds of deli-
cious pasta dishes.

Lucaya
AMERICAN/INTERNATIONAL
This is one of our favorite informal restaurants in the Our Lucaya/Port
Lucaya compound. Set within its own low-slung building on the grounds of
the Westin & Sheraton hotels, it’s the kind of place that raffish-looking crew
members from any of the chartered yachts moored at anchor nearby
search out specifically during their time in port. And despite its location
on the grounds of the most upscale resort on Grand Bahama Island, it man-
ages to remain fun, funky, and laid-back, with a bemused humor at its own
Rastafarian references. Looking for a bar, a cafe, a restaurant, a dance hall,
or a pickup joint? This place can (and has been) all things to all kinds of
people. It evokes a battered airplane hangar where mail planes may have
been repaired during World War II. Many of the industrial parts hanging
from the ceiling, including a collection of semi-antique airplane propellers
and ship hulls, evoke a less high-tech age, when an airplane engine may
actually have been repaired by a pilot wielding a monkey wrench, grease,
and copper wire. When the weather’s right (which is most of the time),
large doors open to bring the outdoors inside, and the party overflows
onto the beach. The all-Bahamian staff is good-looking, the drinks are stiff,
the music is fine, and the place can be a lot of fun. Dig into a “mountain of
ribs,” or else savor the crab cakes (which actually contain a lot of crab,
not just stuffing). Ever had a grilled margarita chicken sandwich? You can
order one here, along with juicy oversize burgers, fajitas, spicy conch
chowder, and the like. Many dishes are at the lower end of the price scale,
making this restaurant an affordable choice.

ENGLISH/BAHAMIAN
By day, you can dine on typical English pub grub. Along with fish and

and steak-and-ale pie. Fat burgers add an American twist to the menu. At
dinner, Bahamian dishes rule, including grilled fish or cracked conch
served with a heaping mound of peas and rice. Dine inside or alfresco,
overlooking the water. Although you shouldn’t feel any discomfort here,
opt for a Painkiller, a rum-filled cocktail that can leave you smashed.

style rack of lamb for two, seafood Newburg, and several preparations of

The Pub on the Mall
No matter what type of food you’re in the mood for, chances are you can find it at one
of the four watering holes under one roof at the Pub on the Mall (located at The Mall
and Ranfurly Circus, opposite the International Bazaar). A meal usually costs $21,
including soup or access to the salad bar, but not dessert; or you can order bar food
for $5 per platter.
Inexpensive pub fare, from fish and chips to T-bone steak and lamb, draws diners to
Prince of Wales Lounge (%242-352-2700; open Mon–Sat noon–1 a.m.). Arrive between
5 and 7 p.m., and you can feast on salad, one of two main courses, dessert, and coffee,
all for only about $8. Thirsty? Try a potent Pub Special: coconut rum, tequila, cherry
brandy, pineapple juice, orange juice, grenadine, and bitters served in a pint mug.
Sit on the balcony at Islander’s Roost (% 242-352-5110; reservations recommended;

mood.
A huge satellite TV broadcasting American and European sports dominates the Red

The only authentic Italian dining spot in Freeport, this 80-seat restaurant

Mama’s kitchen is presented here with quality ingredients, most often
shipped in from the United States. The grilled veal steak is our favorite,
although the homemade pastas are also alluring. The pastas are served
with a wide variety of freshly made sauces. The chef also works his magic
with fresh shrimp. Service is polite and helpful.

The Star Club
$
West End
BAHAMIAN
Among the unassuming places to chew and sip in the West End — about a
45-minute drive from downtown Freeport — The Star Club is the one with
the most character. Opened in 1946 as Grand Bahama’s first hotel, this colo-
nial wooden and concrete two-story building sits on the waterfront. In its
heyday, it welcomed such guests as Ernest Hemingway, Sidney Poitier, and
Martin Luther King, Jr. When other nightspots close, The Star Club is still
a happening place because it’s open nearly 24 hours a day. After partying
elsewhere on the island, many locals head here to listen to music (recorded
or the occasional live band), play pool, and watch the sun rise.
Conch in all its incarnations, fried chicken, burgers, and fish and chips are
on the menu, along with peas and rice. The cook will fill you up with a sat-
isfying meal or snack, but you won’t be on the phone to the editors of
Gourmet magazine. When the weather cooperates, you can watch men pre-
pare fresh conch salad out front at a waterside stand. The owner here
claims that it’s common knowledge that The Star Club’s conch salad is the
best on the island. We agree. The bartender won’t divulge the secret recipe
for his club’s legendary Bahama Mamas, but these drinks keep folks
coming back for more.

SEAFOOD
The most romantic restaurant on the island, The Stoned Crab sits beneath
a soaring pyramid-shaped roof at the edge of the beach. You can eat inside,

but the best seats in the house are on the alfresco patio. The stone crab
claws here are some of the sweetest you’ll ever taste, and the fish — try
the wahoo, yellowfin tuna, or swordfish — are also beautifully prepared.
Other good selections are the crab-and-avocado cocktail and the broiled
seafood platter that’s aromatically seasoned with oregano, garlic, and
white wine. For guests not wanting to eat fish, the restaurant offers a
number of Continental dishes nightly, including chicken parmigiana. If
you’re not the designated driver, be sure to order a Stoned Crab (a potent
rum and fruit juice cocktail) or an Irish coffee. Because the seafood is
freshly caught, not everything on the menu is always available.

At the first-class Westin & Sheraton at Our Lucaya, you’re treated to one
of the most lavish buffet dinners in the entire Bahamian chain. The chefs
conceive of their offering as a giant spread of exotic dishes based on
recipes from around the globe. The décor fits the cuisine, evoking a court-
yard patio in Mexico, a marketplace in old Cairo, the dining hall of an
Indian maharajah, and even an African village. From India comes tandoori
chicken, from Greece moussaka. Another tasty treat is a sausage made
from wild boar. Expect freshly made salads, hot and cold dishes, and lus-

tries snag less daring early risers. Lunch may be a fat gyro or a souvlaki
kebab. Dinner can begin with a Greek salad and then move on to mous-
saka, with baklava for a sweet finish. You can eat inside or enjoy your meal
alfresco. We can’t pretend the food here is like a trip to the Greek isles, but
it’s satisfying in every way.

 Enjoying the island’s watersports
 Exploring Grand Bahama’s land attractions, shopping, and nightlife
 Taking two great day trips
F
rom booze cruises and snorkeling excursions to fishing trips and
kayak paddles, Grand Bahama keeps water lovers busy. The variety
of beaches rimming the island allows devotees to spend their entire
vacations sun-worshipping. Landlubbers can enjoy excellent golf, tennis,
horseback riding, hiking, biking, shopping, and sightseeing. Compared
with Nassau and Paradise Island, Grand Bahama may not be party cen-
tral after dark, but you can find more than enough nightspots for drink-
ing, dancing, and romancing.
Combing the Beaches
White sandy beaches hug Grand Bahama’s southern shores, some 97km
(60 miles) of strands. Footprints are few and far between on most of
these shores. The busiest and best beaches are in Lucaya, the island’s
watersports mecca, where you find the cluster of resort hotels. Freeport
hotels, built inland, shuttle their guests to nearby sandy shores. Xanadu
Beach, located at a resort near Freeport, is a favorite for guests with
beachless accommodations and cruise-ship passengers. This beach can
be crowded at times in winter, but it boasts gorgeous, soft, white pow-
dery sands that open onto tranquil waters. The beach, which stretches
for 1.5km (1 mile), has a backdrop of coconut palms and Australian
pines. Here you find some of the best watersports on the island, includ-
ing snorkeling, boating, Jet-Skiing, and parasailing. On weekends, resi-
dents head to the sands at William’s Town, east of Xanadu Beach and
south of Freeport. Many visitors get their first glimpses of golden Taino
Beach, just east of Lucaya, when they stop by The Stoned Crab restau-
rant for a meal (see Chapter 16). Parasailing, Jet-Skiing, and banana-boat
rides at Taino Beach keep vacationers active.

Chapter 17: Having Fun On and Off the Beach in Grand Bahama 213

The farther east you go, the less crowded the beaches become. You hit
Churchill Beach, then Smith’s Point, followed by Fortune Beach (where
an all-inclusive resort draws many Europeans), and Barbary Beach.
About a 20-minute drive from the hotels in Lucaya, stunning Gold Rock
Beach slumbers at Lucayan National Park. One part of it lures residents
for weekend picnics, while other sections remain secluded.
Playing in the Surf
Ocean Motion Water Sports Ltd., Sea Horse Lane, Lucayan Beach 
(% 242-374-2425), is the largest watersports company on Grand Bahama.
It offers a wide variety of daily activities — weather permitting — from 
9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Parasailing, for example, costs $50 per person; snorkeling
trips cost $35 for 11⁄2 hours; water-skiing costs $25 per 3km (2-mile) pull;
Hobie Cats cost $20 per person; windsurfing costs $30 per hour; and
banana-boating costs $10 per person for a 3km (2-mile) ride. Call for infor-
mation on other activities, including deep-sea fishing, bottom-fishing, and
kayaking.
Banana-boating
You can join a row of other riders on one of these long, yellow inflated
boats for a bouncy trip. As the boat snakes through the waves, you get
splashed, so hold on tight to the handles! Try Sea Affairs Ltd. at Xanadu
Beach, Lucaya (% 242-352-2887). Rides generally cost $10 for kids or
adults.
Diving and dolphin encounters
Both the National Association of Underwater Instructors (NAUI) and the
Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) hold diving certifi-
cation classes at the Underwater Explorer’s Society (UNEXSO; % 800-
992-DIVE or 242-373-1244; www.unexso.com), Port Lucaya Marketplace,
which offer three full days of training for $400. UNEXSO is one of Grand
Bahama’s oldest and most reliable companies. The half-day quickie resort
course ($75) includes a shallow reef dive. Dives start at about $25 for a
one-tank plunge and $50 for a two-tank dive, with all necessary gear. 
The more dives you have in your package, the more the per-dive cost
decreases. At night, the colors of the ocean are especially intense. A
UNEXSO night dive costs $35.
A goal of most scuba divers is to visit Theo’s Wreck, which lies off the
coast of Freeport. In 1982, the Bahamian government sank this 70m (230-
ft.) freighter so that it would become a haven for marine life. Their plan
was successful, and today you can see some of the most varied marine
life off island, ranging from moray eels to sea turtles, at the wreck. Other
popular dive sites include Golden Rock, Pygmy Caves, and Silver Point
Reef.
Part IV: Grand Bahama 
214

Bahamian-owned Caribbean Divers, at the Bell Channel Inn, opposite
Port Lucaya (% 242-373-9111), is another good outfitter. Its certification
courses begin at $350, and its resort course runs $89. Prices begin at $35
for a one-tank dive and $64 for a two-tank dive, including equipment.
Caribbean Divers also offers night dives for $60 and shark dives starting
at around $100. You can rent underwater cameras for $40. For the opti-
mal experience underwater, the company limits groups to a maximum of
18 divers.
Another outfitter is Xanadu Undersea Adventures at Xanadu Beach
Resort (% 800-327-8150 or 242-352-3811; www.xanadudive.com).
Certification courses begin at $450, and resort courses run $40 to $280.
You can have your dive videotaped for $35 or rent your own underwater
camera for $25 to $30, plus film. Dives begin at $40 for one tank and $70
for two tanks. Ask about shark dives for $40 and night dives for $20.
If you want to dive with dolphins, you can do so through UNEXSO’s 
The Dolphin Experience. For the Close Encounter ($69 for adults, free
for children age 7 and younger), a ferry takes you from Port Lucaya
Marketplace to Sanctuary Bay, 3km (2 miles) away. Atlantic bottlenose
dolphins nuzzle your dangling legs as you sit on a partially submerged
dock. Participants stand waist-deep in the water and pet some of these
powerful creatures. The butter-smooth skin of these amiable mammals
feels amazingly soft and warm. While small groups take turns going into
the water, an expert tells you all about the origins, behaviors, likes, and
dislikes of the dolphins. You spend only about 15 minutes body-to-body
with the dolphins.
If you want more time up close and personal, opt for the Swim with the
Dolphins program ($149). When you’re underwater, you can hear their
clicks and clucks as they converse with each other. Contact UNEXSO for
more information.
No matter which dolphin program you choose, reserve as far in advance
as possible.
UNEXSO, which pioneered shark diving ($100) in The Bahamas, schools
you on proper human-shark interaction and takes all kinds of precau-
tions to ensure your safety.
You can have your shark dive videotaped for $30 and up. If you’d rather
snap shots yourself, you can rent underwater cameras from UNEXSO for
$10 and up.
Jet-Skiing and water-skiing
Some people object to Jet Skis, which zoom across the waves like aquatic
motorcycles, saying they’re at odds with Grand Bahama’s tranquillity and
calm waters. However, if you’re interested in this adventure, Sea Affairs
Ltd., at Xanadu Beach (% 242-352-2887) can arrange it for you. The rental
costs $30 for 15 minutes or $50 for 30 minutes.
Chapter 17: Having Fun On and Off the Beach in Grand Bahama 215

If water-skiing is more to your liking, you can also book with Sea Affairs
Ltd., at a price of $20 per person for a 2.4km (11⁄2-mile) ride.
Kayaking
To explore Grand Bahama’s more pristine corners, you can rent Funyaks
through Paradise Watersports at Xanadu Beach (% 242-352-2887).
Rentals cost $9 for 30 minutes or $14 for an hour, plus a $10 deposit.
You can also combine a kayak trip with a guided nature walk: Make a
reservation with Grand Bahama Nature Tours (% 242-373-2485; www.
grandbahamanaturetours.com), run by Bahamian-German husband-
wife team Ed and Erika Gates. You spend 90 minutes of this six-hour
adventure paddling double kayaks along a tidal creek and through a
mangrove forest with branches that create a shady canopy. As fish dart
by, you can spot egrets, greenback herons, and other seabirds. A trek
through Lucayan National Park introduces you to ancient Lucayan
Indian caves, and you’re treated to a picnic lunch on Gold Rock Beach,
where you can swim. The excursion costs $79 for adults, and is free for
kids age 10 and under (half price for children 11–16). Kayak Nature
Tours provides air-conditioned transportation to and from your hotel,
complete with drivers who provide a running narration about Bahamian
history, lore, and sights. The ride is about 40 minutes from the
International Bazaar and 30 minutes from Port Lucaya Marketplace.
Kayak Nature Tours also hosts trips to nearby islands. (See “Going
Beyond Grand Bahama,” later in this chapter.)
Parasailing
Parasailing involves being strapped into a harness that’s attached to a
parachute on one end and a boat on the other. When the boat takes off,
away you go, up toward the clouds. The people, ocean, and beach below
shrink to toy-size. Although you’re airborne for only about five minutes,
the thrill lasts much longer in your memory. Contact Reef Tours at the
Port Lucaya Dock (% 242-373-5880). A ride costs $50 per person.
Snorkeling
The waters around Grand Bahama are clear and ideal for snorkelers,
who can spot such varied marine life as sea turtles, moray eels, and
horse-eyed jacks. Ben’s Cave is a favorite. This panoramic cavern is part
of the Lucayan Cave system. The coral beds at Silver Point Reef and
Gold Rock also draw snorkelers. Most hotels either host their own snor-
keling excursions or can help you make arrangements for trips else-
where. Reef Tours (% 242-373-5880) runs one-hour-and-45-minute
excursions that cost $35 for adults and $16 for children.
Climbing Aboard
You can find plenty of opportunities to explore sea life without 
getting wet.

Robinson Crusoe Beach Party, offered daily from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., costs
$59 per person. The company also has a shorter sunset booze cruise
that goes for $29. (In summer, these cruises are on Tues, Thurs, and Sat
6–8 p.m.) Call for information about how to hook up with this outfitter.
For an underwater cruise, try the company’s quasi-submarine, the
Seaworld Explorer. The sub itself doesn’t descend; instead, you walk
down into the hull of the boat and watch the sea life glide by. The “sub”
departs daily at 9:30 a.m., 11:30 a.m., and 1:30 p.m. The cost is $39 for
adults and $20 for children 12 and under.
Another way to see Grand Bahama’s underwater beauty is to climb
aboard a glass-bottom boat and watch the fish swarm around a diver
feeding them dinner. Try Paradise Watersports on Xanadu Beach 
(% 242-352-2887). The ride costs $25 for adults and $15 for children.
Ocean Wonder, run by Reef Tours, Ltd. (% 242-373-5880), is suppos-
edly the world’s largest twin-diesel-engine glass-bottom boat. Cruises
usually depart from Port Lucaya behind the Straw Market on the bay
side at 9:30 a.m., 11:30 a.m., 1:30 p.m., and 3:30 p.m., except Friday, when
only two tours run, at 9:30 and 11:30 a.m. The tour lasts 11⁄2 hours and
costs $25 for adults, $15 for children ages 6 to 12, and is free for children
5 and under. When calling for a reservation, confirm the departure times
because they may vary by season.
Going fishing
The clear waters off Grand Bahama Island are great for snapper, yellow-
tail, grouper, wahoo, barracuda, and kingfish. Off the coast, fishermen
catch some of the largest game fish in the world, and many fishermen
pursue dolphinfish. In the eastern part of the island, the great fishing
grounds are in Deep Water Cay. The best outfitter is Reef Tours, Ltd.,
Port Lucaya Dock (% 242-373-5880), which offers one of the least expen-
sive ways to go deep-sea fishing around Grand Bahama Island. Adults pay
$100 to fish and $50 if they go along only to watch. Four to six people can
charter the entire 13m (42-ft.) craft for $560 per half-day or $1,150 per
whole day. The 10m (32-ft.) craft can be chartered for $400 per half-day
and $780 for a whole day. Departures for the half-day excursion are daily
at 8:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. Bait, tackle, and ice are included in the cost.
Through Xanadu Undersea Adventures on Xanadu Beach (% 242-352-
3811), you can arrange a 31⁄2-hour fishing trip for $45 per adult and $30
per child. Trips depart at 9 a.m. and 1 p.m.
By law, each person can catch only six wahoo, dolphinfish, or kingfish
per day.
Chapter 17: Having Fun On and Off the Beach in Grand Bahama 217

Another good sport-fishing operation you can try is Running Mon
Marina, Kelly Court, Freeport (% 242-352-6834). For renting boats, 
the most convenient marinas are Running Mon; Port Lucaya Marina 
(% 242-373-9090); and Xanadu Marina and Beach Resort (% 242-352-
6783), Dundee Bay Drive, Lucaya.
Exploring on Dry Land
Freeport and Lucaya keep visitors amused with golf, tennis, horseback
riding, gardens, and nature reserves. Even if you’re not interested in
shopping, the International Bazaar in Freeport and the Port Lucaya
Marketplace in Lucaya are scenic places to wander.
You can visit attractions by taxi, bus, foot, rental car, or on a guided tour.
You have the most flexibility if you strike out on your own, of course.
But if you’d rather let a Bahamian take you, perhaps to several far-flung
attractions, consider a guided tour.
The top attractions
Lucayan National Park
Lucaya
Lucayan National Park is a tropical wilderness preserve on 16 hectares (40
acres). You may want to spend at least a couple of hours exploring trails
and elevated walkways through the thick forest. You arrive at Gold Rock
Creek, fed by a spring from what may be the world’s largest underground
freshwater cave system. Visitors can walk into two caves, except during
bat-nursing season (late spring to midsummer), when one cave is closed.
Spiral wooden steps take you down to the freshwater pools, where you
can see fish darting back and forth. Through UNEXSO (% 888-365-3483
or 242-373-1244; www.unexso.com), adventurous folks can arrange to go
on a cave dive. In the caves, people have found bones and pottery shards
of the Lucayan Indians, who once collected fresh water here.
Across the road from the park entrance, a boardwalk trail leads you
through a mangrove forest down to one of the island’s best beaches, Gold
Rock Beach. Pack a lunch and eat it at a seaside picnic table or on the
dunes, and then cool off in the aquamarine waves.
Before heading out to this remote national park, purchase a ticket ($3 per
adult; free for children age 12 and under) at The Bahamas National Trust
headquarters, located at East Settler’s Way, a half-kilometer east of Coral
Road (% 242-352-5438). Lucayan National Park is a 30-minute drive east
of Freeport and 25 minutes east of Port Lucaya Marketplace. You can take
a taxi or join a bus tour.
See map p. 212. Forty-two kilometers (26 miles) from Freeport, and 32km (20 miles)
east of Lucaya. % 242-352-5438. Admission: $3 adults, free for children age 12 and
under. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–4 p.m.

Parrot Jungle’s Garden of the Groves
Lucaya
This attractive 5-hectare (12-acre) oasis has a pond full of alligators as well
as a petting zoo with Vietnamese potbellied pigs, Pygmy goats, and a cock-
atoo. Macaws on perches welcome visitors, and you can spot an iguana, a
peacock, ducks, and raccoons. Allow at least 45 minutes to see the animals
and to wander across footbridges and along paths past waterfalls, fruit
trees, flowers, and lacy ferns. You can spend a few quiet moments in the
historic chapel that sits on a rise overlooking the garden. Built with native
stone, the chapel is topped by a Spanish tile roof. The garden — 25 min-
utes from the International Bazaar and 15 minutes from the Port Lucaya
Marketplace — honors American financier and developer Wallace Groves,
who founded Freeport with his wife, Georgette.
See map p. 212. On Magellan Drive, off Midshipman Road, Lucaya. % 242-373-5668
or 242-373-1456. Admission: $9.95 adults, $6.95 ages 3–10, free for children under 3.
Open: Daily 9:30 a.m.–4 p.m.
Perfume Factory
Freeport
Touring the fragrance laboratory housed in a replica of a 19th-century
Bahamian mansion takes a mere five minutes. You can discover how the
company produces perfumes, colognes, and lotions from tropical ingredi-
ents. You’re then invited to purchase some. But most people find the mix-
your-own sessions here the best reason to visit. Be prepared for an
olfactory workout. For $30, you can sniff honeysuckle, lavender, gardenia,
jasmine, cinnamon, ginger, and an array of other aromas to decide which
two or three essential oils to combine into your own signature creation.
You can name your concoction and have it bottled and labeled. Choosing
your special scent can take anywhere from 15 minutes to a half-hour.
See map p. 212. Behind International Bazaar. % 242-352-9391. Admission: Free.
Open: Mon–Fri 9:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m.; Sat noon–4 p.m.
Pirates of The Bahamas Beach Theme Park
Taino Beach
Islanders think of this amusement park as their Disney World. This theme
park is one of the largest watersports centers in The Bahamas, featuring
pools for diving and swimming, along with an array of activities, such as
parasailing, banana-boating, snorkeling, kayaking, paddle-boating, and Jet-
Skiing. Children have their own Captain Kidd’s Camp with a supervised
playground. Something’s always happening here, including beach or bon-
fire parties. The park doesn’t charge a general admission fee, but you’re
charged for some of the attractions, such as the 18-hole minigolf course
($6 per person). Bonfire Party Night on Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday
lasts from 6 p.m. to midnight. The price — adults $50, children $20 —
includes free transportation from your hotel, live entertainment, and an
Chapter 17: Having Fun On and Off the Beach in Grand Bahama 219

all-you-can-eat buffet dinner. A restaurant and bar are housed in a wooden
structure that evokes a Spanish galleon.
See map p. 212. Jolly Roger Drive. % 242-373-8456. Admission: Free. Open: Mon–Fri
8 a.m.–4 p.m.; Thurs–Sun 2–10:30 p.m.
Rand Nature Centre
Freeport
Nature buffs, especially bird lovers, need at least two hours to appreciate
this 40-hectare (100-acre) reserve run by the Bahamas National Trust, a
nonprofit conservation association. Named in honor of philanthropist
James H. Rand, this slice of wild Grand Bahama is 3km (2 miles) from the
International Bazaar and less than 6km (31⁄2 miles) from Port Lucaya
Marketplace. One of the highlights is a pond studded with a flock of pink
flamingos, The Bahamas’ national bird. You can get a close-up look at this
endangered species, so bring your camera. Other feathered friends you
may spot are a red-legged thrush, a banana quit, or a Cuban emerald hum-
mingbird. A pair of binoculars comes in handy, especially for the two-hour
guided bird walk that’s held the first Saturday of each month, starting at 8
a.m. A variety of orchids is among more than 100 different types of plants
here. Several species of Bahamian boa constrictors reside in the exhibit
room, along with other indigenous and imported creatures.
See map p. 212. East Settler’s Way, less than a half-kilometer east of Coral Road. 
% 242-352-5438. Admission: $5 adults, $3 children 5–12, free for ages 5 and younger.
Open: Mon–Fri 9 a.m.–4 p.m.
Guided tours
Several tour companies offer informative tours of Grand Bahama Island.
One reliable company is H. Forbes Charter Services Ltd., The Mall at
West Sunrise Highway, Freeport (% 242-352-9311; www.forbescharter.
com). From its headquarters at the International Bazaar, this company
offers half- and full-day bus tours. The most popular option is the half-day
Super Combination Tour, priced at $25 per adult and $20 per child under
12. The tour includes guided visits to the botanical gardens, drive-through
tours of residential areas and the island’s commercial center, and stops at
the island’s deepwater harbor. The tour also includes shopping and a visit
to a wholesale liquor store. Tours depart Monday through Saturday at 
9 a.m. and 1 p.m.; the tour lasts 31⁄2 hours.
If you’re a nature lover, escape from the casinos and take a bush-and-sea
safari with East End Adventures (% 242-373-6662). The safari takes you
through dense pine forests and along deserted beaches, and you go
inland on hikes to such sites as blue holes (natural pools where fresh
water floats on top of salt water), mangrove swamps, and underground
caverns. You may even figure out how to crack conch. You eat a native
lunch on a serene beach in Lightbourne’s Cay, a remote islet in the East
End. Most of the tour is laid-back; you can snorkel in blue holes or shell
hunt. The company conducts safaris daily between 8 a.m. and 5:30 p.m.
The cost is $110 for adults and $55 for kids ages 2 to 12.

Keeping Active
Beaches are paramount on Grand Bahama, but you can find much more
to island life than making waves. Visitors have many options for staying
active on solid ground.
Biking
A guided bike trip is an ideal way to see parts of Grand Bahama that
most visitors miss. Starting at Barbary Beach, you can pedal a mountain
bike along the southern coast parallel to the beach. Stop for a snack,
lunch, and a dip. Finally, you reach Lucayan National Park, some 19km
(12 miles) away. Explore the cave where the Indians buried their dead in
the days when Grand Bahama was theirs. Crabs here have been known
to come up though holes in the ground carrying bits of bowls once used
by the Lucayans. Kayak Nature Tours (% 242-373-2485), the company
that sponsors these trips, transports you home to your hotel by van, so
you don’t have to exhaust yourself in the heat cycling back. The cost is
$79 for adults, half price for children ages 10 to 16. All equipment, suste-
nance, and round-trip transportation from your hotel are included.
Golfing
Grand Bahama is home to more golf courses than any other Bahamian
island. Open to the public throughout the year, the golf courses host a
variety of international tournaments. No need to worry if you don’t feel
like lugging your own clubs — you can rent clubs from any Freeport or
Lucaya pro shop.
Chapter 17: Having Fun On and Off the Beach in Grand Bahama 221
Trekking to the “Wild” West End
Rent a car or hire a taxi and head to West End, which is about 45 minutes from down-
town Freeport. Fishing boats recline along the one narrow road that parallels the
coastline. This tranquil fishing community is the place to go when you’re in the mood
to have a few drinks or swap a tale or two with locals, or when you have a taste for
fresh home-style seafood. Small roadside kitchens move snapper, jack fish, and
grouper from the ocean to the frying pan in record time.
Once the capital of Grand Bahama, West End is inhabited by descendants of the first
settlers of the island. Freeport and Lucaya may be new compared to Nassau, but other
parts of Grand Bahama were developed long before its modern resort areas. West
End is the site of the island’s annual Junkanoo parades on Independence Day (July
10) and Boxing Day (Dec 26). On your way to West End, you pass other old seaside
settlements — some dilapidated, and some in colorful ruins. Many of the tiny houses
are painted bright blues, yellows, and greens. You may also come upon a blue hole (a
natural pool where fresh water floats on top of salt water). When the tide is right, many
locals swim in these pools.

Fortune Hills Golf & Country Club, Richmond Park, Lucaya (% 242-
373-2222), was originally intended to be an 18-hole course, but the back
9 were never completed. You can replay the front 9 for 18 holes and a
total of 6,916 yards from the blue tees. Par is 72. Greens fees cost $31 for
9 holes, $43 for 18. Electric two-seater carts cost $43 for 9 and $55 for 18
holes. Club rental costs $18 for 18 holes and $14 for 9 holes.
The best-kept course on Grand Bahama is the Lucayan Golf Course,
Lucaya Beach at Our Lucaya (% 242-373-1333). Made over after hurri-
cane Jeanne of 2004, this beautiful course is defined as a traditional golf
layout with rows of pine trees separating the fairways. Greens are fast,
with a couple of par fives more than 500 yards long, totaling 6,824 yards
from the blue tees and 6,488 from the whites. Par is 72. Greens fees are
$120 for 18 holes, including a mandatory shared golf cart. 
Its slightly older sibling golf course, with an entirely separate clubhouse
and staff, is The Reef Course, Royal Palm Way, at Our Lucaya (% 242-
373-1333; www.ourlucaya.com/reef_course.asp). Designed by
Robert Trent Jones, Jr., who called it “a bit like a Scottish course but a
lot warmer,” it features a wide-open layout without any rows of trees to
separate its fairways, but lots of water traps — similar to a links course
in the north of Britain. It requires skill, patience, and precise shot-making
to avoid its numerous lakes. You’ll find water on 13 of the 18 holes and
various types of long grass swaying in the trade winds. The course boasts
6,920 yards of links-style playing grounds.
At either of the above-mentioned golf courses, residents of either the
Westin or Sheraton Hotels, with which the courses are associated, 
pay between $84 and $120 for 18 holes, depending on the season.
Nonresidents are charged between $98 and $140 for 18 holes. Use of 
an electric-powered golf cart is included in those rates.

222
The ultimate in relaxation
The ideal place to relieve the stresses of everyday life can be found at the Westin &
Sheraton at Our Lucaya’s Senses Spa. The spa boasts an exercise facility with health
checks, personal trainers, and yoga classes. A cafe serves fresh, natural food and
elixirs. During one of their signature treatments, the Total Senses Massage, two mas-
sage therapists work in sync to relieve your tension. Throughout the Salt Glo body
polish treatment, a therapist buffs away dead-skin cells and polishes your skin with
natural elements from The Bahamas. Note that residents of either the Westin or
Sheraton can use the health and exercise facilities without charge, but that spa,
health, massage, and beauty treatments must be scheduled in advance and require
payment of additional fees. See Chapter 15 for more information on the hotels.

Hiking and birding
Early freed slaves carved out the Heritage Trail as they made their 
way from one part of the roadless island to the other. This 13km (8-mile)
trek, which runs parallel to the beach, takes you to flourishing Lucayan
National Park. At the park, you can spot birds and explore old caves that
the island’s Native Americans once used for fishing, collecting fresh
water, and burying their dead. But the best part of this all-day excursion
is the picnic lunch on a dune, shaded by casuarinas overlooking the
beach, and, of course, the swim afterward. You won’t have to hike back
to your starting point because Kayak Nature Tours (% 242-373-2485)
provides transportation. The cost of the tour is $69 per person. This
company also takes vacationers on early morning bird-watching tours
that include snacks and transportation to and from hotels.
Horseback riding
Take a ride with Pinetree Stables (% 242-373-3600), Beachway Drive,
along a wooded trail through a mangrove swamp to a golden sand
beach. These stables are conveniently located halfway between the
International Bazaar and the Port Lucaya Marketplace. The two-hour
ride costs $75 per person. Groups of up to ten people go out with two
guides per trip twice a day, Tuesday through Sunday. Make reservations
as far in advance as you can, especially in the summer.
Tennis
In Freeport, most visitors play tennis at the nine hard-surface courts 
at Crowne Plaza Golf Resort & Casino (% 242-352-9661). The cost is
$10 an hour for guests and $12 for non-guests. Six courts have lights for
night play (for an extra $12). In Lucaya, The Westin & Sheraton at Our
Lucaya (% 242-373-1333) has four courts, each available for $12 to $18
an hour for guests and non-guests alike. You can rent racquets (for $5)
and balls ($3) and take lessons ($55 per hour) at either of these hotels.
Shopping the Local Stores
If you’re in the market for watches, leather, crystal, china, perfume, or
gemstone and 14-carat gold jewelry, European and American imports
can be considerably less expensive here than at home. Of course, list
prices prevail, and knowing what these prices are back home is always
good so that you can determine whether you’re indeed getting a bargain.
Not a whole lot in the stores is actually produced in The Bahamas —
that is, beyond some clothing, lotions, fragrances, crafts, and straw
goods. Many of the items at the island’s straw markets come from else-
where, including all those colorful, flowing Indonesian fabrics that are 
so popular for women’s wear.
Chapter 17: Having Fun On and Off the Beach in Grand Bahama 223

Port Lucaya Marketplace is an open-air shopping and dining complex
that sprawls along the waterfront in Lucaya. Fire-engine red British tele-
phone booths stand near pastel shingle-roofed buildings festooned with
bougainvillea. Many restaurants are on second-story balconies overlook-
ing the channel. Nearly 100 pubs, restaurants, and boutiques draw both
visitors and residents. Some afternoons and most evenings, live music
spills from the bandstand in the lacy harborside gazebo at Count Basie
Square.
At the older International Bazaar in Freeport, the shops, eateries, and
architecture take visitors around the world. You enter through a tower-
ing torii archway, a symbol of welcome in Japan. Designed in the 1960s,
the place now has a somewhat seedy feel. In many cases, merchandise
and food are only loosely related to the countries represented by the
architecture of the section where they’re sold. But strolling along the
maze of slender, meandering walkways is still amusing. Turn a corner,
and your surroundings suddenly change from Tokyo to the Left Bank of
Paris, from Latin America to Africa, from East India to Hong Kong. You
may have a hard time comparison shopping because figuring out how 
to get back to a place you came from can be tricky. For the most part,
prices here are good — in many cases 20 to 40 percent lower than in the
United States.
Behind the entrance to the International Bazaar, the Straw Market is
packed with stalls where vendors call out to passersby, “It doesn’t cost
anything to look!” Baskets, wide-brimmed hats, bags, place mats, and
dolls are among the most popular straw goods. Tables are also piled
high with T-shirts, beach towels, shell jewelry, magnets, mugs, and
mahogany African-style Bahamian woodcarvings. The International
Arcade, which links the bazaar with the Casino at Bahamia, houses
branches of glitzy stores, such as Parfum de Paris, Columbian Emeralds,
and the Leather Shop. Here, you can also find artisans in booths, includ-
ing glass blowers and jewelry designers.
International Bazaar
Here are some worthwhile shops found at the bazaar.
Art
Flovin Gallery (% 242-352-7564) sells original Bahamian and interna-
tional art, frames, lithographs, posters, and Bahamian-made Christmas
ornaments and decorated coral. It also offers handmade Bahamian dolls,
coral jewelry, and other gift items. There’s another branch at Port
Lucaya Marketplace.
Crystal and china
Island Galleria (% 242-352-8194) boasts an awesome collection of crys-
tal. The store includes works of utilitarian art in china and crystal by
Waterford, Aynsley, Lenox, Dansk, Belleek, and Swarovski. The store can
Part IV: Grand Bahama 
224

pack and ship anything you buy. Another branch is located in Port
Lucaya Marketplace (% 242-373-4512).
Fashion
Cleo’s Boutique (% 242-352-3340) offers apparel from evening wear to
lingerie, as well as everything in between. A warm and inviting destina-
tion, Cleo’s prides itself on capturing the Caribbean woman in all her
moods. You can also find a wide array of costume jewelry beginning at
$25 per piece.
Far East Traders (% 242-352-9280) sells Asian linens, hand-embroi-
dered dresses and blouses, silk robes, lace parasols, smoking jackets,
and kimonos. A branch is located inside the Island Galleria at Port
Lucaya Marketplace.
Paris in The Bahamas (% 242-352-5380) contains the biggest selection
of luxury goods under one roof in the International Bazaar. The staff
wears couture black dresses, and everywhere there’s a sense of French
glamour and conspicuous consumption. The store offers both Gucci 
and Versace leather goods for men and women; crystal from Lalique,
Baccarat, Daum, Kosta Boda, and Orrefors; and a huge collection of 
cosmetics and perfumes.
Gifts
Caribbean Cargo (% 242-352-2929) is one of the island’s best gift shops,
specializing in such items as picture frames, candles, clocks, and clothes.
Unusual Centre (% 242-373-7333) is exactly what its name suggests.
Where else can you find a wide array of items made of eel skin or goods
made from exotic feathers, such as peacock? Another branch is located
at Port Lucaya Marketplace (% 242-352-5994).
In addition to these gift shops in the bazaar, Bahamian Things, 15B
Poplar Crescent (% 242-352-9550), sells an array of locally handcrafted
items, including books on The Bahamas, Abaco ceramics, woodwork,
and even handmade Christmas decorations.
Jewelry
Colombian Emeralds International (% 242-352-5464) is a branch of the
world’s foremost emerald jeweler, offering a wide array of precious gem-
stone jewelry and one of the island’s best watch collections. Careful
shoppers will find significant savings over U.S. prices. The outlet offers
certified appraisals and free 90-day insurance. Two branches are also
located in Port Lucaya Marketplace (% 242-373-8400).
Leather
The Leather Shop (% 242-352-5491) is another good outlet, carrying a
much more limited Fendi line but also many other designers, including
Chapter 17: Having Fun On and Off the Beach in Grand Bahama 225

Land and HCL. Additional leather goods include shoes and gift items.
Other locations include Port Lucaya Marketplace (% 242-373-2323) and
Regent’s Centre (% 242-352-2895).
Perfume
Les Parisiennes (% 242-352-5380) offers a wide range of perfumes,
including the latest from Paris. It also sells Lancôme cosmetics and skin-
care products. You’ll find a branch at Port Lucaya Marketplace (% 242-
373-2974).
The Perfume Factory Fragrance of The Bahamas (% 242-352-9391) 
is the top fragrance producer in the country. The shop is housed in a
model of an 1800s mansion, and visitors can go inside to hear a five-
minute commentary and to see the mixing of fragrant oils. A “mixology”
department lets you create your own fragrance from a selection of oils.
The shop’s well-known products include Island Promises, Goombay,
Paradise, and Pink Pearl (which has conch pearls in the bottle). The
shop also sells Guanahani, a fragrance created to commemorate the
500th anniversary of Columbus’s first landfall in the New World.
(“Guanahani” was the Indian name for the southern Bahamian island of
San Salvador, traditionally believed to be the site of Columbus’s land-
ing.) Other perfumes and colognes include Sand, the number-one
Bahamian-made men’s fragrance in the country.
Port Lucaya Marketplace
The following are some of the highlights of the marketplace.
Androsia (% 242-373-8387) is the Port Lucaya outlet of the famous
batik house of Andros Island. Its designs and colors capture the spirit of
The Bahamas. Fabrics are handmade on the island of Andros. The store
sells quality cotton resort wear, including simple skirts, tops, jackets,
and shorts for women, and it also offers a colorful line of children’s
clothes.
Animale (% 242-374-2066) attracts fashionistas who would define this
as a hot boutique with the kind of clingy sophisticated tropical fashion
that makes any reasonably shaped woman look good. Come here for
long cotton dresses that make the female form look more-than-usually
provocative, and fashion accessories such as oversize straw hats,
chunky necklaces, and animal-print scarves.
Bandolera (% 242-373-7691) carries a collection of chic women’s cloth-
ing that’s many, many cuts above the usual run of T-shirts and tank tops.
The staff can be rather haughty here, however.
Colombian Emeralds International (% 242-373-8400) is a branch of the
world’s foremost emerald jeweler offering a wide array of precious gem-
stone jewelry and one of the island’s best watch collections. Careful
shoppers will find significant savings over U.S. prices. The outlet offers
certified appraisals and free 90-day insurance.
Part IV: Grand Bahama 
226

Flovin Gallery II (% 242-373-8388) is a branch of the art gallery that’s
located in the International Bazaar. It sells a collection of oil paintings
(both Bahamian and international), along with lithographs and posters.
In its limited field, it’s the best in the business. It also features a number
of gift items, such as handmade Bahamian dolls and decorated corals.
Harley-Davidson of Freeport (% 242-373-8269) is one of only two regis-
tered and licensed Harley outlets in The Bahamas. You can special-order
a motorcycle if you feel flush with funds from a casino. Or you can con-
tent yourself with T-shirts, leather vests, belts, caps, sunglasses, and gift
items.
Jeweler’s Warehouse (% 242-373-8401) is a place for bargain hunters
looking for good buys on discounted, closeout 14-karat gold and gem-
stone jewelry. Discounts can be up to 50 percent, but the quality of
many of these items remains high. You can get guarantees and certified
appraisals.
UNEXSO Dive Shop (% 242-373-1250) is the premier dive shop of The
Bahamas. It sells everything related to the water: swimsuits, wet suits,
underwater cameras and video equipment, shades, hats, souvenirs, and
state-of-the-art diving equipment.
Living It Up After Dark
At press time, Grand Bahama maintained only one casino, the Isle of
Capri at the Westin & Sheraton at Our Lucaya Resorts, Royal Palm Way
(% 242-373-1333). It’s set within its own free-standing building on the
resort grounds. Outfitted in a neutrally modern, not-particularly ostenta-
tious design, it contains a crescent-shaped bar, a restaurant, and games
that include baccarat, Caribbean stud poker, blackjack, roulette, and
some 400 slot machines. It’s open daily from 10 a.m. to 2 a.m. or later;
entrance is free.
For an evening with island appeal, try the Yellowbird Showroom at Best
Western Castaways Resort, East Mall Drive, Freeport (% 242-352-6682).
Fire eaters, calypso singers, and limbo dancers put on a festive show
Monday through Saturday from 9 to 11 p.m. ($20 per person, including
one drink; or $32 per person for the show, dinner, and drinks). About a
45-minute drive from Freeport, West End is a local after-hours target,
particularly The Star Club (% 242-346-6207), which usually stays open
until dawn. Where Grand Bahama’s local nightclubs leave off, hotel and
restaurant bars and lounges pick up the slack, with crowded dance
floors.
In Port Lucaya Marketplace’s waterfront Count Basie Square, live music
pumps from the gazebo almost every night, starting around 7:30 p.m.
You may hear calypso played on steel drums, a reggae band, a Junkanoo
troupe, or a gospel group. Some say that the idea for the marketplace
Chapter 17: Having Fun On and Off the Beach in Grand Bahama 227

itself originated with the Count, the legendary American jazz pianist and
bandleader who spent his last years on Grand Bahama. Most of Port
Lucaya’s stores close after dark, but the marketplace still throbs with
activity under the stars. The bars and restaurants surrounding the
square are serious hangout spots for both residents and visitors.
If you didn’t get enough of the waters surrounding Grand Bahama during
the day, make a reservation for a moonlight dinner cruise with Superior
Watersports (% 242-373-7863). You can feast on steak and lobster on a
fun-filled 22m (72-ft.) catamaran. Cruises run Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday from 6 to 9 p.m. and depart from Port Lucaya Marketplace; the
cost is $59 for adults and $39 for children.
Going Beyond Grand Bahama
Whether you’re a novice or an experienced kayaker, one of the following
excursions can introduce you to another side of The Bahamas.
Trip #1: Kayak and snorkel 
adventure to Peterson Cay
You can go from Grand Bahama, one of the country’s largest islands, to
one of its smallest, by kayak. Nearby uninhabited Peterson Cay is an itty-
bitty national park on a reef. After you reach this pristine slip of land
edged by a luscious beach, Freeport and Lucaya seem like Las Vegas. You
can go on this excursion with Kayak Nature Tours (% 242-373-2485).
When you arrive at the tour’s starting point — about a 25-minute drive
from Freeport — you paddle for about 30 minutes to the cay. For about
90 minutes, you can snorkel around the island with the colorful fish and
marine life. A trip with Kayak Nature Tours costs $69 per person. The
company keeps snorkel groups to a maximum of ten people, even when
more participants are in the total group of kayakers. The company pro-
vides all the necessary gear, and your driver entertains you with a run-
ning narration about Grand Bahama as you’re transported to and from
your hotel.
Part IV: Grand Bahama 
228
Bahamian theater
If you’re visiting The Bahamas between September and June, call the 450-seat
Regency Theater, West Sunrise Highway (% 242-352-5533), and ask if any shows are
running. This is the home of two nonprofit companies, The Freeport Players’ Guild and
the equally talented Grand Bahama Players. You could see anything from reprises of
such Broadway and West End (London) blockbusters as Oliver! to contemporary
works by Bahamian and Caribbean playwrights. Tickets cost from $15 to $20. 

Trip #2: Kayak trip to Indian Cay
Another kayak adventure offered by Kayak Nature Tours (% 242-373-
2485) costs $89 per person and takes seven hours. This trip combines 
a kayak adventure with a snorkeling tour and is excellent for first-time
snorkelers or more experienced adventurers. The tour begins with sight-
seeing in the old hamlet of West End, site of the first settlement on Grand
Bahama Island. Then guests go by kayak to Indian Cay, one of the most
remote of all the islands in the North Bahamas. According to legend,
Ponce de León discovered this cay and named it La Vieja (The Old One)
after an old Lucayan woman he found there. Upon seeing her, he knew at
once that he hadn’t found the Fountain of Youth he so eagerly sought.
Participants take a short nature walk across this tiny cay that time forgot,
then later, back on “mainland” Grand Bahama, explore underwater trails
at Old Bahama Bay Resort. At the resort, visitors are served lunch on a
private beach.

a modern resort on Treasure Cay. In this part, we give you
plenty of suggestions for having fun in the sun and sampling
everything from conch fritters to lobster. Most importantly,
you ﬁnd out the best ways to travel among these small,
scenic cays by air, land, and sea.

Chapter 18
Marsh Harbour and 
Great Abaco Island
In This Chapter
 Getting around Marsh Harbour
 Finding Marsh Harbour’s best accommodations and restaurants
 Exploring the island’s best beaches, watersports, and attractions
A
fter New Providence Island (where you find Nassau and Paradise
Island) and Grand Bahama Island (home to Freeport and Lucaya),
the “prime” grouping of islands is the Abaco archipelago. The island
chain is the most visited of the Out Islands, and it’s a prime destination
for boaters and fishermen.
When people speak of “the Abacos,” they’re referring to a boomerang-
shaped archipelago of mostly minor cays, lying in the northeastern part
of the island nation. The Abacos begin at tiny Walker’s Cay in the north
and stretch for 209km (130 miles) in a southwesterly direction. Most of
these cays are uninhabited.
As the center of Abaconian commerce, Marsh Harbour is the best refuel-
ing stop in all the Out Islands, with the largest range of facilities, includ-
ing marinas, shopping centers, banks, and pharmacies. Even though
Marsh Harbour is large enough to boast a Pizza Hut, it’s still small
enough to walk around; it has only one traffic light. However, the town
lacks the quaint New England charm of New Plymouth (see Chapter 20)
or the allure of Hope Town (see Chapter 19).
Marsh Harbour is also the major transportation hub of the Abacos, with
its airport functioning as the main arrival point for most visitors — at
least those who didn’t sail in on a boat.
Arriving at the Airport
Regardless of where you’re going in the Abacos, Marsh Harbour is the
easiest town to reach. Minor airstrips are in the Abacos, including

Treasure Cay (see Chapter 21), but Marsh Harbour offers the most con-
venient flights servicing the Abaco chain.
The airport is a ten-minute drive south of Marsh Harbour. Upon arrival,
you’ll find restrooms, phones, and a little snack bar, along with taxis
waiting to take you where you want to go. There are no car-rental agen-
cies at the airport; you have to make arrangements after you reach
Marsh Harbour.
Choosing Your Location
Marsh Harbour is at the crook of the bend in the archipelago (just oppo-
site of Elbow Cay). Treasure Cay lies to the north, a distance of 45km
(28 miles) from Marsh Harbour, and you reach it by taking a badly paved
road.
If you’re an adventurer, you’ll want to drive 40km (25 miles) farther
north to Little Abaco Island. Birders come here to look for the West
Indian red-bellied woodpecker, and sometimes you can still see wild
horses. On the way to Little Abaco, you pass the Treasure Cay airport
and the dock where visitors take a ferry to Green Turtle Cay. The last
town on Great Abaco Island is a hamlet called Cooper’s Town. After
that, you can take a causeway that links Great and Little Abaco islands.
Little Abaco’s small settlements are hardly worth a stopover — you can
take in Cedar Harbor (with a few good beaches) and Mount Hope, which
you reach after another 8km (5 miles) and is mainly known for its drug-
store and grocery. A drive 8km (5 miles) to the northwest delivers you 
to the hamlet of Fox Town, which may be the end of your tour, with its
post office and police station. The actual end of the line is another 3km
(2 miles) ahead when you come to Crown Haven. After this point, you
have to turn around and go back south to Marsh Harbour.
Although there are tiny harbors of no importance in Great Abaco, when
locals refer to “the harbor,” they mean the yacht-filled Marsh Harbour in
the center of the Abacos. Marsh Harbour opens onto the Sea of Abaco.
To better understand the geography of the Abacos, refer to the map
“The Abaco Islands” in Chapter 3.
Where you stay in the Abacos — Marsh Harbour, Elbow Cay, Green
Turtle Cay, or Treasure Cay — depends on your tastes and interest.
Before you make a decision, go through all four of these island chapters
to see which one appeals to you, because each island of the Abacos has
its devotees as well as its detractors. For example, Green Turtle Cay may
draw a snobby yachting crowd who may not be charmed at all by the
more middlebrow allures of Marsh Harbour.

Chapter 18: Marsh Harbour and Great Abaco Island 235
Getting Around Marsh Harbour 
and Great Abaco
In many of the smaller islands of the Abacos, including Treasure Cay and
Green Turtle Cay (see Chapters 21 and 20, respectively), you can manage
without a car. If you plan to stay in Marsh Harbour and visit one of the
offshore islands, such as Elbow Cay (reached by ferryboat; see Chapter
19), you still don’t need a car. But if you want to explore “mainland” Great
Abaco Island, including points south such as Bahamas National Trust
Sanctuary, you need a car.
 Hoofing it: Marsh Harbour is a small town, and you can get around
on foot, but you won’t really find that much to see. We suggest
saving your legs for a day trip to Elbow Cay (see Chapter 19),
where you can walk endlessly along its beaches of golden sand.

 Driving around: You don’t need a car to get around the town itself,
but if you want to explore the rest of the island on your own, you
can rent a car, usually for $70 to $80 a day or $350 to $400 per week
(be prepared for bad roads, though). In Marsh Harbour, call A&P
Rentals (% 242-367-2655), Don MacKay Boulevard, to find out
whether any vehicles are available.
 Pedaling around: Rental Wheels of Abaco (% 242-367-4643),
Queen Elizabeth Drive, rents bikes for $10 a day or $45 a week and
mopeds for $45 a day or $200 a week. The best place to go biking is
the long road heading south from Marsh Harbour. Along the way, you
may want to stop at a secluded beach to beat the heat of the day.
 Taking a taxi: Unmetered taxis, which you often have to share with
other passengers, meet all arriving flights. They can take you to
your hotel if it’s on the Abaco “mainland”; otherwise, they can drop
you at a dock where you can hop aboard a water taxi to one of the
neighboring offshore islands, such as Green Turtle Cay or Elbow
Cay. Most visitors use a combination taxi and water-taxi ride to
reach the most popular hotels. From Marsh Harbour Airport to
Hope Town on Elbow Cay, the cost is about $12 for the transfer. You
can also make arrangements for a taxi tour of Great or Little Abaco.
These tours, however, are expensive, and you don’t really see that
much. Sightseeing on foot in one of the Loyalist settlements, such
as New Plymouth, is better. Taxis are independently owned and
operated, so there’s no central number to call. But you can easily
find a taxi at the airport. If you need one otherwise, you can ask the
staff at your hotel to summon one for you.
 Boarding a boat: Because Marsh Harbour is the boating capital of
The Bahamas, some Bahamians use boats more frequently than a
car to get around. Albury’s Ferry Service (% 242-367-3147) can
take you to the most interesting offshore islands, including Elbow
Cay and Great Guana Cay.

Abaco Beach Resort & Boat Harbour
$$$–$$$$
Marsh Harbour
This 82-room beachfront resort — the biggest and best in Marsh Harbour —
is a good choice, especially if you’re serious about diving or fishing. This
property extends over a sprawling acreage at the edge of town and meets up
with a small beach. The business has several different faces: the hotel, with
its handsomely furnished rooms that overlook the Sea of Abaco; the well-
managed restaurant and bar; the Boat Harbour Marina, which has slips for
180 boats and full docking facilities; and a full-fledged dive shop. The beach
here is small and gravel studded and isn’t reason enough to check in. But it

is private, reserved only for residents of the hotel. The bedrooms are better
equipped than the ones at its rival, Conch Inn Hotel (see next review). At
the Abaco Beach Resort, the rooms are air-conditioned and include a TV
and extras, such as a minibar, hair dryer, and safe. Angler’s Restaurant is
one of Marsh Harbour’s best (see the review in the “Dining Out” section later
in the chapter). A swim-up bar and beachfront bar serve light snacks and
grog. Two tennis courts, a fitness center, a sauna, and massage services are
on-site. Staff can also arrange boat rentals for you at the marina.

Marsh Harbour
Slightly downscale from the Abaco Beach Resort & Boat Harbour (see pre-
vious review), this little nine-room inn lies at the southeastern edge of the
harbor. One of the world’s largest yacht-chartering companies, The
Moorings, leases this casual, one-story hotel on a long-term basis. A
number of sandy beaches are within driving distance. Its small motel-style
bedrooms have two double beds, and you can get rollaways if you have
extra occupants. All units overlook the yachts bobbing in the nearby
marina. A freshwater pool, fringed with palm trees, and a nearby branch
of the Dive Abaco scuba facility are on the premises. The on-site restaurant
and bar is Curly Tails (see the review in the “Dining Out” section later in
this chapter).

Great Guana Cay
Even better than any of the accommodations of Marsh Harbour is an
escape to the offshore Great Guana Cay and this ten-room charmer (for
more details on this cay, refer to “Going Beyond Marsh Harbour and Great
Abaco” later in this chapter). Set directly astride one of the best beaches
in The Bahamas, and a 15-minute walk north of Guana Cay’s largest set-
tlement (Guana Village), this resort offers informal but very comfortable
lodgings. Four of the units are in the main house and have queen-size beds,
ceiling fans, small refrigerators, and microwaves; three of them contain
private screened-in decks with teakwood furniture. The oceanfront cot-
tages, which accommodate between two and four guests, have queen-size
beds, ceiling fans, air-conditioning, and kitchenettes. The showers are out-
side but are secluded and screened by island flora. The place is private,
intimate, and laid-back. The on-site restaurant, The Landing, offers a
“conch crawl,” which is a Bahamian take on a lobster tank. Nippers, a
beachfront bar and grill, is a five-minute walk away. A saltwater pool is

the hotel.

Lofty Fig Villas

Marsh Harbour
This family-owned, six-unit bungalow colony overlooks the harbor. It 
doesn’t have the services of a resort like Abaco Beach, but it’s good for
families and self-sufficient types. Built in 1970, the villas stand in a tropi-
cal landscape with a freshwater pool and a gazebo where you can barbe-
cue. Rooms have one queen-size bed and a queen-size sofabed, a dining
area, a kitchen, and a private screened-in porch. The hotel provides maid
service Monday through Saturday. The hotel is about a ten-minute walk
from a supermarket and shops, and you can find restaurants and bars just
across the street. You can also find marinas, a dive shop, and boat rentals
close by. From the Lofty Fig, you have to walk, bike, or drive a half-
kilometer (1 mile) east to a point near the Marsh Harbour ferryboat docks
for access to a sandy beach and a snorkeling site. (Many visitors opt to go
to Great Guana Cay for their day at the beach.)

$$$
Casuarina Point
A wide deck and a garden surround this 20-room, family-managed bone-
fishing club, which is set within the hamlet of Casuarina Point, 29km (18
miles) south of Marsh Harbour. This ecologically conscious place was built
at the edge of a saltwater marsh favored by a variety of birds, wild hogs,
and iguana; it’s a good choice for bird-watchers and superb for bonefish-
ing enthusiasts. It’s not luxurious, but it’s a peaceful place near good snor-
keling and virgin beaches. The hotel is closely associated with several
bonefishing guides in the neighborhood, any of whom can arrange full-day
fishing excursions costing from $375 per couple. (This cost doesn’t include
all equipment. Be sure that you understand the arrangements thoroughly
before you commit yourself.) Each of the small to midsize bedrooms has
a screened-in porch, a ceiling fan, a small bathroom, and simple furnish-
ings; eight rooms have air-conditioning. During your stay, you’re in the
midst of a close-knit, isolated community that’s firmly committed to pre-
serving the local environment and heritage. You can even visit a living
museum that takes you back through 100 years of the island’s history. The
hotel also has a bar and restaurant where the staff can recite a selection
of simple Bahamian fare to you before you sit down for your meal. The
food is quite good. Non-guests can drop in for meals.

Marsh Harbour
BAHAMIAN/SEAFOOD
Angler’s is the main restaurant of Marsh Harbour’s major resort (Abaco
Beach Resort & Boat Harbour; see our review in the “Staying in Style” sec-
tion earlier in this chapter). The place is open and airy, overlooking the
Sea of Abaco. Within a few steps of your seat, dock pilings rise from the
water, and yachts and fishing boats come and go. The menu changes daily,
but it always features fresh seafood — which the chef prepares with
finesse — along with a well-chosen selection of meat and poultry dishes.
Begin with spicy lobster bisque, a timbale of grilled vegetables, or perhaps
crab Rangoon, served on bean-sprout slaw with a pineapple-coconut
sauce. Main dishes dance with flavor, notably the lobster stir in a mango
chile sauce and the guava-glazed charred lamb chops. We also recommend
the freshly-caught red snapper, prepared with just the right infusion of
fresh basil.

Only the Angler’s Restaurant (see our earlier review in this chapter) is
more sophisticated than this winning choice. Located at the Conch Inn

sional athletes. The cooks use local ingredients, such as freshly caught
grouper and snapper, whenever they can. They also seem to know every
conceivable way to prepare conch. The regulars don’t even consult the
menu; they just ask, “What’s good?” Diners also look for daily specials,
such as curried or steamed chicken. Fish and seafood are always on the
menu. If you’re frittering away a few hours, drop in for a rum-based drink.
Chapter 18: Marsh Harbour and Great Abaco Island 239
A taste of the Abacos
In Marsh Harbour, conch salad is sold right on the docks. “It’ll make a man out of you,”
one local vendor tells everybody, even if the person is a woman. If you stick around
long enough, you’ll see Billy Thompson coming by in his little truck. He’s said to make
the world’s best homemade soursop-and-mango ice cream. If you want to go really
casual, try Island Bakery, Don MacKay Boulevard (% 242-367-2129), which has the
best Bahamian bread and cinnamon rolls on the island, often emerging fresh from the
oven. You can even pick up the makings for a picnic.

The bar, set beneath an octagonal gazebo near the piers, is a fine place to
meet people.

The chefs try a little harder here, offering a typical menu but adding a hint
of island spirit. They dress up grilled grouper with a bit of mango and
tomatoes, and cracked conch makes an appearance as well. Your best bet,

Of the major towns of the Out Islands, Marsh Harbour has one of the
least appealing sets of beaches. You can opt for any of a trio of private
beaches, but none is very enticing, and all carry the stigma of not really
wanting outsiders. The easiest of these three beaches to visit is the one
at the Abaco Beach Resort, but it’s small, not really fabulous and, again,
private. Buy a drink for a local at the hotel bar and you’re in, but that is
a somewhat uncomfortable arrangement, at best.
Most beachgoers get into their cars and head south of Marsh Harbour.
After 15 to 20 minutes of southbound driving, starting at points south of
Little Harbour, lots of good beaches begin to appear. The beaches in the
vicinity of the hamlet of Casuarina Point benefit from some battered, all-
Bahamian restaurants in the vicinity.
Some swimmers heading south from Marsh Harbour go eastward from
the main highway whenever an offshoot road appears, usually at points
near Little Harbour or at points south of Little Harbour. Other times,
they simply stop their cars wherever they feel like it.
None of the beaches of Great Abaco Island has facilities or lifeguards.
Guard your valuables and be safe.
Playing in the surf
Divers swim to the Abacos Train Wreck, which you can explore in 4.5 to
6m (15–20 ft.) of water; the wreck consists of two almost-intact locomo-
tives lying on their sides. Yet another wreck nearby, the Adirondack,
lies in shallow water some 3 to 7.5m (10–25 ft.) deep. Many divers also
come here to explore the government-protected Sea Preserve and Fowl
Cay Land, which teems with multi-colored sea life in shallow reefs.
One of the best places to snorkel, with a colorful offshore reef, moray
eels, and a plethora of beautiful rainbow-hued fish, is Mermaid Reef. It
lies on a narrow, scrub-covered peninsula known as Pelican Shore,
Part V: The Abacos: Prime Out Islands 
242

which forms the northernmost edge of Marsh Harbour’s harborfront. You
can drive to a point near the origin of Pelican Shore, trek across a stretch
of scrub and sand, and then swim out to Mermaid Reef. Alternatively,
some hardy locals sometimes swim from central Marsh Harbour across
the harbor, walk across the very narrow sands of Pelican Shore, and then
swim once again the short distance to Mermaid Reef.
Dive Abaco, at the Conch Inn Hotel & Marina (% 800-247-5338 in the
U.S. or 242-367-2787; www.diveabaco.com), provides services as simple
as renting snorkeling gear or as in-depth as offering full dive trips to tun-
nels and caverns in the world’s third-longest barrier reef. Uncertified
novice divers can take all-inclusive resort courses for $150. Two-tank
dives, including tanks and weights for certified divers, are $80. Snorkeling
is $50. Trips depart daily at 9:30 a.m., and demand dictates afternoon
trips. Sea Horse Boat Rentals, at the Abaco Beach Resort & Boat
Harbour (% 242-367-2513), also rents snorkeling gear.
Climbing aboard
Because the Abacos are the boating capital of The Bahamas, many visi-
tors arrive for only one purpose: to charter a boat and go sailing.
Ask about the depth of the harbor before you rent and, even more
importantly, before you attempt to navigate your way in or out of Marsh
Harbour, because Hurricane Floyd changed the configuration of the
channel. People with yachts that have deep drafts have reported trouble
getting in and out of the port.
If you want to try bareboating in The Bahamas — boating without a cap-
tain or crew — Abaco Bahamas Charters (% 800-626-5690 or 242-366-
0151; www.abacocharters.com), can set you up. Weekly charters with 
a choice of boats begin at $1,625, with a $1,500 deposit required. Only
experienced sailors can rent.
The Moorings (% 888-952-8420 or 242-367-4000) is one of the leading
charter sailboat outfitters in the world. It operates from an eagle’s nest
perch behind the Conch Inn Hotel & Marina, overlooking a labyrinth of
piers and wharves — at least 80 berths, with more on the way — where
hundreds of upscale watercrafts are tied up (many of them for rent).
With one of its vessels, you can enjoy short sails between the islands,
stopping at white sandy beaches and snug anchorages. Yacht rentals
generally range from $455 to $1,280 a day, with a skipper costing another
$144 per day, and an onboard cook (if you want one) priced at an addi-
tional $122 per day.
For the more casual boater, Sea Horse Boat Rentals, at the Abaco Beach
Resort (% 242-367-2513), offers some of the best rentals. A 5.5m (18-ft.)
Boston Whaler rents for $170 per day; a 6.5m (22-ft.) Privateer rents for
$200 per day. You can also rent other vessels, and all boats are equipped
with a Bimini top, coolers, a compass, and a swimming platform, along
with life jackets, a paddle, docking lines, and other equipment.
Chapter 18: Marsh Harbour and Great Abaco Island 243

Exploring on Dry Land
In monuments or sightseeing attractions, Nassau doesn’t fear competi-
tion from little Marsh Harbour, which some regard as a mere refueling
stopover. However, Marsh Harbour is the best center for exploring the
nature-created sights of Great Abaco Island, which consists of both
Great Abaco and Little Abaco.
A fully graded and tarred main highway links all the settlements on the
“mainland” with such colorfully named hamlets as Fire Road, Mango Hill,
Coopers Town, Joe Creek, Red Bays, Snake Cay, Little Harbour, Sandy
Point, Cherokee Sound and, our favorite, Hole in the Wall, which lies at
the “bottom” of Great Abaco. (See “The Abaco Islands” map in Chapter 3
to help you visualize the area.)
Driving south for 40km (25 miles) from Marsh Harbour along the Great
Abaco Highway, you come first to Cherokee Sound, with a population
of 150. Cherokee Sound is located at the end of a peninsula that juts out
into Cherokee Sound. Residents are descendants of Loyalists who fled
the mainland U.S. in 1783 and remained faithful to the British Crown.
These people faced an inhospitable land, and for two centuries have
tried making a living as best they can. The men dive for lobsters or go
out at night “sharking.” They sell the jaws of the sharks in Marsh
Harbour. They also hunt down tiniki crabs as well as pigeon and wild
boar in the remote pinelands of the Abacos.
From Cherokee, you can head north to Little Harbour, a settlement
about 12km (8 miles) south. While in Little Harbour, visit Pete Johnston’s
Foundry (% 242-367-2720). In the Abaco gift and souvenir shops, you’ll
see a remarkable book, Artist on His Island, detailing the true-life adven-
tures of Randolph and Margot Johnston, who lived a Swiss Family
Robinson–type adventure with their three sons. Arriving on this
southerly point of the Abacos aboard their old Bahamian schooner, the
Langosta, they lived in one of the natural caves on the island until they
eventually erected a thatched dwelling for themselves in 1951. The
Johnstons, including son Pete, have achieved international fame as
artists and sculptors — though they still live at Little Harbour, a cay
shaped like a circle, with a white sand beach running along most of it.
Pete Johnston, using an old “lost-wax” method, casts his bronze sculp-
tures, many of which are in prestigious galleries today. Margot Johnson
creates porcelain figurines of island life — birds, fish, boats, and fishers.
She also works in glazed metals. They welcome visitors at their studio
daily from 10 to 11 a.m. and from 2 to 3 p.m. Their art comes in a wide
price range.
Before leaving the foundry, you can stop in for a drink at laid-back Pete’s
Pub. This rustic pub is beloved by yachties throughout the Abacos. The
artwork is intriguing, and the beer is cold. The pub was constructed in
Part V: The Abacos: Prime Out Islands 
244

part by the timbers of the Langosta. In the evening, Pete Johnson may
sing a medley of sea chanties, accompanying himself on his guitar.
After leaving Cherokee and Little Harbour, you can return to the Great
Abaco Highway, heading south once again to reach the little fishing vil-
lage of Casuarina Point, west of Cherokee Sound. Here you find a lovely
stretch of golden sands and some jade-colored boneflats.
If you keep going south, you come to Crossing Rocks, a little fishing vil-
lage 64km (40 miles) south of Marsh Harbour, noted for its kilometer-
long beach of golden sand. The hamlet where locals barely eke out a
living takes its name from the isthmus where Great Abaco Island nar-
rows to its thinnest point.
If you continue traveling south, you come to a fork in the road: The
southern road goes to the Abaco National Park (also called Bahamas
National Trust Sanctuary) and the aptly named Hole in the Wall, which
is the end of the line for Great Abaco.
Protected by the government, the 8,296-hectare (20,500-acre) Abaco
National Park, established in 1994, sprawls across the southeastern por-
tion of Grand Abaco Island. Some 2,023 hectares (5,000 acres) of it is pine
forest, with a lot of wetlands that are home to native bird life, including
the endangered Bahama parrot. Hardwood forests, sand dunes, and man-
grove flats fill the area. Rangers under the sponsorship of the Bahamas
National Trust (% 242-393-1317), which operates occasional tours of
the sanctuary, protect this area.
Touring on your own can be extremely difficult, and any private outfit-
ters in the area aren’t very well organized. An exception is Ron and Erin
Lowe-Pagliaro (www.abacooutback.com), who offer sea-kayaking, snor-
keling, land tours, and birding excursions. A half-day kayak trip costs
$55 per adult or $35 for children 11 and under; a full day costs $85 for
adults and $45 for children. They also offer a tour 21⁄2 hours south of
Marsh Harbour through the Abaco National Park to Hole in the Wall; the
cost is $95 per adult or $55 per child. Contact them via their Web site.
Living It Up After Dark
The most popular gathering spot in Marsh Harbour is the Sand Bar at
the Abaco Beach Resort & Boat Harbour (% 242-367-2158), opening
onto the Sea of Abaco. The yachting crowd, often from Miami, hangs out
here, swapping tall tales of the sea while downing lethal rum punches.
Another good hangout is at Wally’s, East Bay Street (% 242-367-2074),
the second-most frequented place to hang out. You can enjoy Wally’s
special punch on an outdoor terrace or inside a cozy bar. On Wednesday
and Saturday, live entertainment often performs. Sapodilly’s Bar & Grill
(% 242-367-3498), East Bay Street, attracts an interesting blend of locals
and visitors, some of whom play at its pool table, others preferring to
mix and mingle at the bar.
Chapter 18: Marsh Harbour and Great Abaco Island 245

Going Beyond Marsh Harbour 
and Great Abaco
The greatest day trip is to Hope Town on Elbow Cay (see Chapter 19).
Great Guana Cay is less known but is also an intriguing jaunt by ferry
from Marsh Harbour.
Great Guana, on the east side of the island chain, stretches 4km (7 miles)
from tip to tip and lies between Green Turtle Cay and Man-O-War Cay. It’s
the longest of the Abaco cays. The beachfront runs the length of the cay
and is spectacular — one of the loveliest in The Bahamas. The reef fish-
ing is superb, and bonefish are plentiful in the shallow bays.
The settlement stretches along the beach at the head of palm-fringed
Kidd’s Cove, named after the pirate. The ruins of an old sisal mill near
the western end of the island make for an interesting detour. The island
has about 150 residents, most of them descendants of Loyalists who left
Virginia and the Carolinas to settle in this remote place.
As in similar settlements in New Plymouth and Man-O-War Cay, houses
here resemble those of old New England. Over the years, the traditional
pursuits of the islanders have been boatbuilding, carpentry, farming,
and fishing. It doesn’t take long to explore the village because it has only
two small stores, a one-room schoolhouse, and an Anglican church.
Albury’s Ferry Service, Marsh Harbour (% 242-365-6010), runs three
ferries per day to Great Guana Cay. A round-trip ticket costs $15; one-
way is $10.
Instead of driving around the island, most people get around in small
boats. On the cay, you can charter a boat for a half-day or a full day (or a
month, for that matter). One company to try is Seagull Fishing Charters
(% 242-366-0266) in Hope Town. Carrying up to six passengers in a
9.4m (31-ft.) Stapleton, Seagull offers sailings from Elbow Cay to Lubbers
Quarters for $490 for four hours; from Marsh Harbour to Man-O-War for
$530 for four hours, and from Marsh Harbour or Elbow Cay to Guana Cay
for $590 for four hours.
If you want to stay at this remote location, Dolphin Beach Resort is a
good hotel. (See the listing in the “Staying in Style” section earlier in this
chapter.) Most visitors come just for the day, returning to Marsh Harbour
for the night.
For fun on the beach, head for Nipper’s Beach Bar & Grill (% 242-365-
5143), a dive where visitors hang out with the locals. Right on the sands,
you sit in split-level gazebos and take in the most stunning seascape in
the Abacos, with a snorkeling reef just 11m (36 ft.) offshore. Burgers and
well-stuffed sandwiches satisfy your hunger at lunch. But the best time
to go is on a Sunday afternoon for a pig roast. One guest supposedly

tion is located in the center of town near
Marsh Harbour’s sole traffic light.
Post Office
The Marsh Harbour Post Office is on Don
MacKay Boulevard (% 242-367-2571).
Safety
More crime occurs in Marsh Harbour than
anywhere else in the Abacos, but taking the
same precautions that you would take at
home should be enough to protect you and
your belongings. Keep valuables in a safe
place and don’t go into deserted, unfamiliar
areas alone at night.
Taxis
Taxis meet incoming flights at the Marsh
Harbour airport. During your stay, the staff
at your hotel can call one for you whenever
you need one.

isit Elbow Cay and you risk coming back year after year, as so many
Canadians, Americans, and Europeans who now own vacation homes
do. The main settlement is Hope Town, a charming Cape Cod–like village
with narrow paved streets, saltbox cottages, little clapboard houses with
white picket fences around flowering gardens, and a red-and-white striped
lighthouse.
Autumn is quiet in these parts, so some hotels and restaurants close in
September and October. Elbow Cay isn’t a bustling island with big resorts,
so you find few places that have TVs or even phones in the rooms.
Arriving in Elbow Cay
Anyone can board a plane and get off in a vacation spot, but you have to
be determined to have an out-of-the-ordinary beach vacation to choose
an island like Elbow Cay. Not only do you have to board a plane — or
two — but you also have to take a taxi, a ferry, and a shuttle van to get
to your hotel. That is, unless you sail in on a boat.
The best way to get to Elbow Cay is to fly into Marsh Harbour (see
Chapter 18), home of the Abacos’ main airport. From here, you take a
taxi to the dock to catch the ferry across Whale Cay Channel to Hope
Town, about 20 minutes away ($10 one-way, same-day round-trip $15).
Service is three times a day.
You need to coordinate your flight arrival and departure with the ferry
schedule. Ask the staff at your hotel for details or call Albury’s Ferry
Service (% 242-365-6010). If you contact your hotel, your hotel staff
can meet you at the ferry dock.

Choosing Your Location
Elbow Cay’s long and secluded white sand shores, some backed by
sandy dunes, are serious contenders for The Bahamas’ most stunning
locales. Elbow Cay is practically divided by White Sound, a small, tran-
quil body of water. Accommodations are on or near sandy shores in
Hope Town and White Sound, but because the hotels are small and few
in number, beaches remain virtually vacant.
Getting Around Elbow Cay
Many visitors rent boats to get around the island, explore nearby cays,
and go on fishing and snorkeling trips. Even if you’re not interested in
playing sea captain, you can still move easily around Elbow Cay.

 Hoofing it: The quiet, narrow streets of Hope Town are reserved
for pedestrians, and you can walk to many other parts of tiny
Elbow Cay.
 Wheeling around: You can’t rent a car on Elbow Cay, but that isn’t
a problem. Hope Town, the scenic seaside village, bans all motor
vehicles. If you want a golf cart delivered to your hotel, call Island
Cart Rental (% 242-366-0448; www.islandcarrentals.com);
these gas or electric carts go for $40 to $45 a day or $240 to $270
week. Hotels provide shuttle vans to and from town. Some dining
rooms offer pickup and drop-off service at dinnertime, if you call
ahead. Bicycles — often free for hotel guests — are available at or
near most accommodations.
Staying in Style
Abaco Inn
$$
White Sound
This sophisticated, 22-unit adult retreat — popular with honeymooners —
faces a white sandy beach on White Sound. The inn stands at the narrow-
est point in Elbow Cay. On the east side, the more turbulent surf of the
ocean washes in. Up the shore is a secluded beach where some buffs sun
in the nude, which is technically illegal in The Bahamas. More of a resort
than its chief rivals, Hope Town Harbour Lodge and Club Soleil Resort,
Abaco Inn offers you a choice of eight luxury villa suites with sunrise and
sunset sea views or a series of simply but comfortably furnished guest cot-
tages fronting either the Atlantic or White Sound. Shaded by sea grape and
palm trees, hammocks wide enough for two hang outside cottages. A stone
fireplace keeps the lounge in the main house cozy. Yachties favor the bar
or the on-site restaurant, one of the island’s finest. (See the review in the
“Dining out” section later in this chapter.) Vans periodically take guests to
and from Hope Town. Bicycles are complimentary, and many people rent
boats.

Hope Town
This colorfully landscaped seven-room hotel, with the popular seafood
restaurant Club Soleil (reviewed in this chapter’s “Dining Out” section),
is across Hope Town Harbour. The accommodations aren’t as fine as those
at Abaco Inn (see previous review), but they’re comfortable and far more
tranquil because of the secluded property near the lighthouse on the west-
ern edge of Hope Town. You reach the resort by boat — either one you
rent and moor at the hotel’s marina or else a hotel boat that’s sent to bring
you over. At the resort, you find several lovely golden sand beaches and

an on-site saltwater pool. The midsize accommodations feature a clean-
cut, tasteful décor. Bedrooms have amenities such as private balconies
that open onto the water and cedar-lined closets for storing your belong-
ings. You don’t have a phone, but you get a TV with VCR. In addition, the
staff can arrange all sorts of watersports.

$$–$$$
Hope Town
This Hope Town landmark sits on a narrow bluff between the harbor, with
its red-and-white striped lighthouse, and the ocean, with its white sand
beach. Snorkeling is idyllic at the reef just offshore, where spotting turtles
and dolphins along with all kinds of crayon-colored fish is the norm.
Some of the 19 cheerfully decorated guest rooms have decks overlooking
the pool and the ocean. Book one of these units, located across the road
from the main building, if you want a minifridge and, more importantly, if
you don’t want to climb many stairs. Other rooms in the main building are
smaller and have views of the town and harbor. A few paces down the road
from the main building is the historic Butterfly House — one of the oldest
surviving homes in Hope Town. The hotel owners transformed it into a
two-bedroom, two-bathroom, two-deck vacation cottage with a full
kitchen. As many as six people can stay here comfortably. You can dine by
the saltwater pool, on the terrace high above Hope Town Harbor, or in the
more formal wood-paneled restaurant. (See the listing later in this chap-
ter’s “Dining Out” section.) The staff can arrange boat rentals and water-
sports for you.

Hope Town
Staying in Hope Town Hideaways is like living in your own second home in
The Bahamas. These five gingerbread-trimmed villas lie across the harbor
from where the ferryboats from Marsh Harbour arrive. The villas, tucked
away on 4.5 hectares (11 acres) of grounds, live up to their name. The
accommodations are part of a larger complex of privately owned homes,
surrounded by grounds handsomely landscaped with orange trees, man-
goes, and flamboyant bougainvillea. One or two couples — the maximum
is six guests — can sleep comfortably in the units, each with a large
kitchen, dining room, living area with two single daybeds, and two bed-
rooms with queen-size beds. Furnishings are custom built. You’re not on
the beach, but you can enjoy the freshwater pool.

These villas are on 2.4 hectares (6 acres) of landscaped grounds 6km 
(31⁄2 miles) south of Hope Town near the southernmost tip of Elbow Cay.
With its jagged limestone coast, the beach at this hotel may not be good
for swimming, but surfers have a ball in the rolling waves. Fortunately, a
good sandy beach is just a five-minute walk away, and either an energizing
hike or an invigorating bike ride can take you to beautiful, secluded Tahiti
Beach. Sea Spray’s five oceanside and harborside cottages range from one-
bedroom, one-bathroom to two-bedroom, two-bathroom. All have decks,
barbecue pits, air-conditioned bedrooms, and ceiling fans. Kitchens are
fully equipped, but you don’t need to cook because you can find a good
restaurant, the Boat House (reviewed later in the “Dining Out” section),
right on the premises. Unlike some homelike accommodations that have
limited housekeeping service, these villas come with daily maid service.
Grounds are handsomely landscaped, and the waterfront swimming pool
is a relaxing spot. Most guests rent boats here at the 60-slip marina.

Dining Out
You can find a decent variety of culinary offerings on Elbow Cay, from
Bahamian favorites to gourmet international dishes. Most restaurants
serve variations of rum punch, and nearly every menu has both Key lime
pie and coconut pie.
You don’t need to dress up at most restaurants here — shorts and a 
T-shirt are fine. However, Abaco Inn, Club Soleil, and Hope Town
Harbour Lodge have the most upscale dining, so casual resort clothes
are more appropriate. Several restaurants provide complimentary trans-
portation to and from your hotel.

gather on the deck for drinks; we recommend the Bahama Breeze (Bacardi

Depending on when you come, you may find turtle burgers or crawfish on
the menu at this casual alfresco dining spot at the edge of the harbor. Any
time of year, the grouper and conch are well prepared and are the freshest
food on the menu. Landlubbers gravitate toward the more routine fried
chicken and burgers. The Key lime pie and the chocolate silk pie are jus-
tifiably popular dessert choices. Try Cap’n Jacks’s version of the
omnipresent Goombay Smash. Come on Wednesday or Friday between 
8 and 11 p.m. for live local music.

SEAFOOD
Windows around this breezy wood-paneled dining room at the edge of the
harbor make you feel as if you’re on a boat. You look out to Hope Town,
just across the water. Vernon Malone (brother of Rudy Malone, owner of
Chapter 19: Elbow Cay 253

this hotel and restaurant) depicted a miniature version of town in the
restaurant’s driftwood wall sculpture. Sunday brunch is the big deal here,
with the eggs Benedict getting rave reviews from us. Dinner may be
poached salmon or a seafood platter, with Key lime pie for dessert. The
chefs competently prepare all dishes with imported ingredients and turn
out a very tempting menu, although one that doesn’t reach the level of the
Abaco Inn. For a cocktail, try a Tropical Shock, made from dark, light, and
coconut rum with fruit juices.
Make reservations through your hotel or Vernon’s Store in Hope Town. If
you don’t have your own boat, arrange to be picked up at the post office
dock in town and ferried across.

Harbour’s Edge is almost always busy, if “busy” is an adjective you can use
to describe sleepy Elbow Cay. The deck is topped with wooden picnic
tables that give you a front-row seat for viewing the candy-cane lighthouse
and the boat-packed harbor. At lunch, patrons eagerly gobble up the gul-
lywings (chicken wings), conch chowder, crawfish salad, and fish sand-
wiches. Chefs prepare dinners of grilled, blackened, or fried grouper, as
well as steamed or grilled Bahamian crawfish. With afternoon happy
hours, a Saturday-night DJ, and the island’s only pool table, this place is a
lively hangout for a loud, young crowd. Try an Over the Edge, the restau-
rant’s signature drink, made with banana rum and fruit juices.

BAHAMIAN/INTERNATIONAL
Lunch by the pool that overlooks a sandy beach is a special affair at the
Hope Town Harbour Lodge. Popular midday treats are the curried tuna,
the curried lobster, and the grouper Rueben. You eat dinner either in the
dining room, with its pickled wood-paneled walls, or on the terrace above
the harbor. Consider tasting the Chinese-style grouper spring rolls with a
mustard-laced chutney or the peppered filet mignon. The menu is hardly
inventive, but the staff properly seasons and prepares dishes well.

Bahamian-born, European-trained Norris Smith spent years as the

Just outside Hope Town
BAHAMIAN
At Rudy’s, you feel as if you’ve been invited to dine with friends, because
this rustic restaurant is in a former private residence. The hearty meals
include the island’s best conch fritters, soup (maybe potato, lima bean, or
broccoli), a fresh salad, freshly baked warm bread, and dessert (try the
“chocolate suicide” cake). Your main course could be New York strip steak
or lamb chops with mint jelly. The most justifiably popular choice is the
crawfish; the chef removes the meat from the shell, lightly batters and fries
it, places it back in the shell, and then bakes it with Parmesan cheese. The
wine list offers a good selection of French, German, Portuguese, and
American vintages.
Don’t be surprised if your waiter is a child — the son or daughter of one
of the other workers. When you call to make a reservation, you can
arrange complimentary transportation to and from your hotel.

Exploring the Sand and Surf
Exploring empty beaches and sailing to nearby cays are activities cen-
tral to any Elbow Cay vacation. On dry land, the small harborside village
known as Hope Town is the place to wander.
Combing the beaches
In Hope Town, you’ll find sandy beaches right at your doorstep, and
beaches in the south are only about a 15-minute ride away. Near Sea
Spray Resort in White Sound, Garbanzo Beach lures many surfers.
Isolated Tahiti Beach, at the southern end of the island (a little more
than a half-kilometer, or 1 mile, from Sea Spray), got its name from its
thick wall of palms. At low tide, the shelling can be excellent along this
Chapter 19: Elbow Cay 255

gorgeous curve of sand, and these shallow waters make for good bone-
fishing, too. Across the water, you can see uninhabited Tilloo Cay and
the thrashing waves of the Atlantic in the distance.
Tahiti Beach is about a ten-minute bike ride from Sea Spray and about 
20 minutes from Abaco Inn, both in the White Sound area. To get here,
you may have to walk your bike up and down a few of the small but
rocky rises.
Along the way, you pass sea grape trees, fluffy long-needled pines, and
other varied roadside vegetation. Turn left when you come to the first
major left (by the house on the bluff). Turn right when you see two stone
pillars. Go downhill and turn left at the end of the road at the wire
fences. Take this path to the end. Walk along the dense palm grove to the
beach. Because you’re heading for the shore, which is public, ignore the
PRIVATE — NO TRESPASSING signs.
Pencil-thin Tilloo Cay and the tiny Pelican Cays lie to the south of Elbow
Cay. Their irresistible deserted beaches make them excellent targets for
a day’s sail. The waters around Tilloo Cay, packed with grouper and
conch, are particularly good for both fishing and swimming. In the
Pelican Cays Land and Sea Park, Sandy Cay Reef is one of the most col-
orful dive sites around. The area is protected, so line fishing, spear fish-
ing, crawfishing, and shelling are all taboo.
Playing in the surf
In the Abacos, Elbow Cay is one of the best places for snorkeling. A
favorite strip of beach for snorkelers is Mermaid Beach, with a colorful
reef that teems with moray eels and various tropical fish. The beach is at
Mermaid Reef, 3km (2 miles) north of Hope Town on the eastern side of
the island. If you need snorkeling equipment, check with your hotel —
most have snorkel gear on hand to rent or lend to guests who don’t
bring their own. Otherwise, contact Sea Horse Boat Rentals (% 242-
367-2513; www.seahorseboatrentals.com). 
Through scuba-outfitter Froggies Out Island Adventures (% 242-366-
0431; www.froggiesabaco.com), two-tank dives start at $95, plus equip-
ment. Resort courses run $145, and certification courses are $500. Half-
day snorkel boat trips start at $45, and you can spend plenty of time —
as much as two hours — in the water.
The waves and breezes at Garbanzo Beach, in the White Sound area,
make it prime hang-ten territory. If you don’t bring your own surfboard,
the staff at nearby Sea Spray Resort (% 242-366-0065) can help you 
get one.
Climbing aboard
The waters off the coast of Elbow Cay are a popular spot for boating and
fishing. Head down to the marina if you want to join in the fun.
Part V: The Abacos: Prime Out Islands 
256

For boat rentals, starting at about $100 a day for a 5m (17-ft.) Boston
Whaler, call Island Marine (% 242-366-0282; www.islandmarine.com),
near Hope Town, or Sea Horse Boat Rentals (% 242-367-2513; www.
seahorseboatrentals.com) in Marsh Harbour. Ask about recommen-
dations for local fishing guides.
If you want to forego the 20-minute ferry ride to Elbow Cay after you
arrive at the airport in Marsh Harbour, you can rent a boat to get here on
your own and then use the boat for your entire vacation. At The Moorings
(% 888-952-8420 or 242-367-4000; www.moorings.com), rates start at
around $455 a day for an 11m (36-ft.) monohull boat that can carry a maxi-
mum of six people.
Exploring on Dry Land
No cars are allowed in the heart of Hope Town. Bikers and pedestrians
have these narrow paved streets to themselves. What you do find are
some harborside restaurants and pastel-painted saltbox cottages with
purple and orange bougainvillea tumbling over stone and picket fences.
Amid the usual island fare at the handful of souvenir shops, you see
resort wear made out of Androsia, the fabric produced on the Bahamian
island of Andros.
Stores in Hope Town are shut tight on Sunday, and the various 
churches — surprising in number for such a tiny village — are in full
swing. You may happen upon the outdoor Catholic service held in 
waterfront Jarret Park Playground, next to the main dock.
To find out why “Malone” is such a common surname, stop by the
Wyannie Malone Museum (officially open most days from 10 a.m. to
noon but unofficially open “whenever”). This small collection of island
lore pays tribute to the South Carolinian widow and mother of four who
founded Hope Town around 1783. Like other parts of the Abacos, includ-
ing Green Turtle Cay and Man-O-War Cay, Elbow Cay was settled by
European Americans loyal to the British Crown. Unwilling to face the
outcome of the American Revolution, they began new lives in The
Bahamas.
The most photographed site in the Out Islands is Hope Town’s red-and-
white striped lighthouse at the edge of the Hope Town Harbour. Before
the lighthouse was erected in 1838, many of Hope Town’s residents
made a good living luring ships toward shore to be wrecked on the
treacherous reefs and rocks, turning the salvaged cargoes into cash. 
To protect their livelihood, some people tried in vain to destroy this
beacon while it was being built. Today, you can climb to the top of the
40m (130-ft.) tower for panoramic views of Hope Town Harbour and
town. Most weekdays between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., the lighthouse keeper
is happy to give you a peek. The lighthouse is within walking distance of
Club Soleil and Hope Town Hideaways. If you’re staying elsewhere, you
can make arrangements through your hotel for a visit.

Living It Up After Dark
On Saturday nights, a young party crowd gathers at Harbour’s Edge 
(% 242-366-0087), a Hope Town bar and restaurant that has the island’s
only pool table. On Monday nights, Bahamian barbecues draw many
people to Sea Spray Resort (% 242-366-0065), about 5km (3 miles) 
from Hope Town. The food is as good as the low prices, and you can
hear live music. Other evenings, people hang out at the bars of hotels
and restaurants — or they turn in early to rest up for yet another day 
of exploring.
Going Beyond Elbow Cay
Spend a day scuba diving, snorkeling, and island hopping with Froggies
Out Island Adventures (% 242-366-0431; www.froggiesabaco.com).
You have easy access in and out of the water from this company’s
double-deck 11 and 17m (35- or 55-ft.) yachts, which come complete with
bathrooms. While you sit on the top deck or in the shade down below,
your boat may pass a pod of dolphins. You stop at Fowl Cay Land, filled
with caves and 17m (55-ft.) pillars of coral. If you’re snorkeling, you may
not be able to swim in and out of the grottoes, but you can see plenty of
fish, including frown-faced groupers and other colorful marine life. You
may even spot sharks.
You also stop at Great Guana Cay, a pretty island that’s even quieter
than Elbow Cay, for lunch at a restaurant, and then you head to Man-O-
War Cay to roam around the handsome old shipbuilding village. (For
more details about Man-O-War Cay, see Chapter 21.) Nature walks and
beachcombing are part of this excursion. Adult snorkelers are $55 and
children are $40. Prices for certified divers start at $75.
Fast Facts: Elbow Cay

Shop Pharmacy (% 242-367-3106), located

from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. but is closed for lunch,
usually between 1:30 and 2:30 p.m.
Safety
Elbow Cay is a very safe island. Remember
to take the same precautions that you
would whether you’re at home or on vaca-
tion: Keep valuables in a safe place and
don’t go into deserted, unfamiliar areas
alone at night.
Taxis
Taxis meet incoming flights at the Marsh
Harbour airport, and they greet arriving fer-
ries as well. During your stay, the staff at
your hotel can call one for you whenever
you need one.

reen Turtle Cay is about 5km (3 miles) west of Great Abaco Island,
the “mainland.” The beach-rimmed coastline of this 5.6km-long 
(31⁄2-mile), .8km-wide (1⁄2-mile) island dips in and out of bays and sounds.
Most vacationers get around by boat — usually on a rented craft. If you
don’t charter your own boat, you can easily join fishing, snorkeling, or
diving excursions.
One of the best ways to spend a day is to explore deserted beaches on
nearby uninhabited islets. On some trips, your captain may spear a few
lobsters, catch some fish, and grill them for you right on shore.
Coral colonies starting in relatively shallow water make for exceptional
snorkeling, and diving is good here as well. Anglers and boaters flock to
Green Turtle Cay, especially during the spring and summer. The fewest
visitors check in to hotels in the fall.
Arriving in Green Turtle Cay
Fly to Treasure Cay Airport (see Chapter 21), where a taxi can take you
to the ferry dock for departures to Green Turtle Cay. At the dock, you
may have to wait a while for the ferry. Green Turtle Cay is about a 15- to
A tip on tipping
As your taxi pulls up to the ferry dock on the Treasure Cay side, chances are young

money. Be as gracious and as generous as you can.

20-minute ride from the dock. The ferry takes you directly to the Green
Turtle Club, if you’re staying there, or to New Plymouth. This land-and-
sea transfer costs $16 per person round-trip.
Treasure Cay Airport is one of three airports in the Abacos, so be sure
that you book the right destination. If you fly into Marsh Harbour, you
have to take a 45-minute taxi ride for $80 or more to the Green Turtle
Cay ferry dock. Before making your airline reservations, check the ferry
schedule with your hotel to be certain that your flight doesn’t arrive too
late or too early.
Choosing Your Location
The island’s two main resorts are on the water in the north. Bluff House
borders both a quiet sandy bay and a marina, and the Green Turtle
Club, a short walk from a good beach, sprawls along a marina. If you’re

vacationing with friends or family, consider renting a beachside cottage.
If you seek historic charm, head for the New Plymouth Inn, located in
New Plymouth, the New England–style, 18th-century village at the south-
ern end of the island.
Getting Around Green Turtle Cay
Although you can walk to many parts of Green Turtle Cay, water is the
most common mode of transportation. Some hotels provide water trans-
port to town or to weekly hotel parties. Many vacationers rent boats
(see “Exploring the Sand and Surf” later in this chapter), but if you prefer
not to, you have other options for getting around.
 Hoofing it: Most of the island is accessible on foot. The virtually
car-free streets of New Plymouth, a quiet 18th-century seaside vil-
lage, are prime walking territory.
 Going by golf cart: On Green Turtle Cay, golf carts stand in for
rental cars. D & P Rentals (% 242-365-4655), at the Green Turtle
Club Marina, lets you use one of theirs at $45 for eight hours or $60
per day.
 Pedaling around: You can bike all over the island. Cycling is espe-
cially scenic in historic New Plymouth. For $14 a day, Brendal’s
Dive Center (% 242-365-4411), at the Green Turtle Club Marina,
rents cruisers and ten-speeds.
Staying in Style
Green Turtle Cay has only two large places to stay. And what goes for
“large” here is still fewer than 35 rooms. Although some units are plush,
don’t count on finding a TV or phone in yours. Like the other Abaco
Islands, Green Turtle Cay is for vacationers who want a retreat. If you’re
expecting a large, amenity-studded resort, you’ll be disappointed.
Bluff House Beach Hotel
$$–$$$
Between White Sound Harbour and Sea of Abaco
With a popular, elegant restaurant, Bluff House sits on the highest spot on
the island, which is only 24m (80 ft.). The marina hugs one side of the prop-
erty while a cozy beach borders another. The view of the water from the
main house and the pool deck is panoramic. Originally built as a private
house during the 1950s, Bluff House grew over the years as the owners
added rooms for visiting friends. Today guests — often honeymooners —
stay in 30 units, ranging from ordinary hotel rooms to plush three-bed-
room villas. The décor is as varied as the accommodations, with hard-
wood, tiled, or carpeted floors, Oriental rugs, and antique floral patterns
in some rooms, and airy wicker furniture in others. Spacious, split-level

suites with balconies overlook the ocean. Guests receive complimentary
use of snorkel gear, and the staff can make arrangements for other water-
sports. (If you swim out to the rocky ledge around the corner, you can find
some good snorkeling.) A shuttle bus transports guests to New Plymouth,
in the southern part of the island, three times a week.
Wooden boardwalks and stairs lead up and down the hilly grounds. Don’t
think about taking high heels to this terrain; if you have any trouble walk-
ing, don’t even consider Bluff House.

At the Sea of Abaco
On the north end of Green Turtle Cay, at a point where 152m (500 ft.) of
land separates the Atlantic Ocean from the Sea of Abaco, this four-unit cot-
tage complex opens onto a beach on the Atlantic side of the island and
another sandy beach on the more tranquil bay. These accommodations
are ideal for guests who want to anchor in for a while (literally — lots of
folks arrive by private boat, which you can moor here for free; otherwise
you can come directly by water taxi from the airport dock). Done in a
refreshing style of Caribbean furnishings and pastel colors, the oceanfront
property occupies 2 hectares (5 acres) dotted with some 50 tropical fruit
trees. Each cottage has two bedrooms, a living room, a dining room, and
a fully equipped kitchen with a microwave. Rebuilt in 1988 and renovated
in 1996, the spacious cottages have improved over the years. Linens and
kitchen utensils are provided (you can also stock up on groceries at three
shops in New Plymouth), and ceiling fans and trade winds cool the rooms.

Green Turtle Club & Marina
$$$
White Sound Harbour
Although it’s the fanciest hotel in the Abacos, the Green Turtle Club is far
from stuffy. A lively crowd gathers in the clubhouse lounge most nights for
conversation, backgammon, and predinner cocktails. Yachting flags hang
from the ceiling beams, and business cards and dollar bills scrawled with
names paper the walls. During the coolest time of year, a fire often roars in
the hearth in this cozy lounge. With plenty of fishermen and boaters arriv-
ing, spring and summer are the most popular — and most expensive — sea-
sons here. The 34 rooms and villas vary in size, view, and décor and are
spread out along the marina and near a pool. In your room, you’re likely to
find a Queen-Anne dresser and four-poster mahogany bed, an Oriental
throw rug and vase, an oak floor and wood-trimmed door, a snazzy bath-
room with a dressing area, and a patio. Some of the deluxe rooms even have
Chapter 20: Green Turtle Cay 263

TVs. Calm Coco Bay Beach is about a five-minute walk from here, and the
rougher ocean beach is just ten minutes away. Talk to the staff to arrange
a variety of watersports. Once a day, a shuttle bus takes guests into town.

Dining Out
The hotel restaurants are the fanciest — and, of course, the most 
expensive — places to dine. They all have just one seating for dinner, so
be sure to make reservations. Folks tend to dress up for dinner at Bluff
House and Green Turtle Club & Marina. Although this practice may
mean shirts with collars for men, neither restaurant requires jackets or
ties. In New Plymouth, you can find several casual, local restaurants to
try. Lobster season is during August and September.

evenings are more subdued, with guests sharing boating, fishing, and
diving stories over first-rate food at candlelit tables. The house drink is a
rum–and–fruit juice concoction called the Tranquil Turtle. One night you
may order the prime rib or lobster, while another evening you can sample
the roast lamb wrapped in bacon with honey-rosemary glaze. Or try the
crispy duck breast with a grapefruit and Grand Marnier sauce. Many of the
homemade desserts come from local recipes. The chef can handle special

fast, you can order eggs or chicken souse (a hot and spicy souplike
Bahamian specialty). For lunch, try a conch burger, cracked conch plat-
ter, or a more prosaic hamburger. For dessert, many patrons choose the
apple turnovers or the hummingbird cake (sweetened with banana and
pineapple). Alongside shelves packed with alcohol (the store has 60 types
of rum for sale), you can also browse through a mega-selection of hot
sauces from The Bahamas and elsewhere. When you’re through feeding
your body, you can tend to your spirit at the art gallery next door.

The Wrecking Tree
$
New Plymouth
BAHAMIAN
A large, shady cedar tree grows up through the front porch of this popu-
lar eatery. Some people say that The Wrecking Tree got its name because
19th-century wrecking vessels brought their salvage to this spot, but many
residents can tell you the true origin: People used to sit under the tree and
drink until they got “wrecked.” Stop here for pastries, cool drinks, or a
Bahamian meal. Start off with zesty conch fritters, and then try the fish,
conch, pork chops, ribs, turtle steak, or crawfish.
See map p. 261. Bay Street. % 242-365-4263. Complete dinner: $13–$15. No credit
cards accepted. Open: Mon–Sat 11 a.m.–9 p.m.
Exploring the Sand and Surf
Along with sampling Green Turtle Cay’s aquatic activities, you can visit a
museum and wander the streets of New Plymouth, the historic water-
front village.
Combing the beaches
About a ten-minute walk from Bluff House and five minutes from the
Green Turtle Club, Coco Bay is one of the most beautiful crescents in
The Bahamas. Shaded by casuarina pine trees and lapped by lazy waves,
this long beach is often empty. The rougher Ocean Beach, about a ten-
minute stroll from either Bluff House or the Green Turtle Club, is another
stunner. Frothy waves thrash the stark white sand, which is set off by
the intense blue of the Atlantic.
You can take a boat trip to one of the nearby uninhabited islands that
are ringed with even more pristine beaches. On Manjack Cay, for exam-
ple, the expanse of sugar-white sand seems to go on forever, and the
shallow, clear water is a brilliant shade of turquoise. There’s no regular
service from the ferry dock; negotiate with one of the local boatmen or
hook up with one of the trips offered by Captain Ray (% 916-933-3766).
Playing in the surf
With one of the world’s largest barrier reefs, the Abacos offer some of
The Bahamas’ best and least crowded snorkeling and diving sites, with
plenty of variety. You can get an eyeful of reefs starting at depths of just
1.5m (5 ft.) and ranging to 18m (60 ft.) and more. Like sheets on a clothes-
line, sprawling schools of fish billow by coral caverns, huge tube and
barrel sponges, and fields of elk and staghorn coral. Sea turtles and large
groupers are common sights. In fact, the waters are so clear that you can
often see farther than 30m (100 ft.).
Scuba divers can poke around the wreck of the San Jacinto, an American
steamship that was built in 1847 and sank two decades ago. At this site,
Part V: The Abacos: Prime Out Islands 
266

you can feed the resident bright green moray eel. Plan to spend about
$135 for a scuba resort course, $500 for full certification, $55 for a one-
tank dive, or $75 for a two-tank dive.
If you like small groups and big fun, try Brendal’s Dive Center (% 242-
365-4411; www.brendal.com) at the Green Turtle Club Marina. Whether
you’re an experienced diver or snorkeler or you’re just getting your feet
wet, the personal attention you get makes the difference here. Originally
from Acklins, a small Bahamian island to the south, the dive company
has more than two decades of underwater experience. A special treat for
snorkelers is the wild dolphin encounter trip ($75 per person), which
includes stops at undisturbed islands. This company also rents kayaks
($10 per hour/$190 per week for singles; $12 per hour/$250 per week for
doubles). You can also hook up with Green Turtle Divers (% 242-365-
4271).
Climbing aboard
If you’ve had enough of sitting on the beach and relaxing, you can explore
the ocean. From boat rentals to fishing expeditions, Green Turtle Cay
offers an array of offshore activities.
Based at the Green Turtle Club Marina, Brendal’s Dive Center (% 242-
365-4411) can take you on a group sunset cruise (complete with rum
punch) on an 8.8m (29-ft.) sailboat for $60 per person (up to eight pas-
sengers). If you’d prefer to see the coral without getting wet, book one 
of Brendal’s glass-bottom boat trips ($50 per person).
Contact Donny’s Boat Rentals, in Black Sound (% 242-365-4119), for
speedboats. This company rents Whaler and Mako motorboats starting
at $70 a day. Or you can try Reef Rentals, directly across from the ferry
dock in New Plymouth (% 242-365-4145). This fleet includes a sleek
motorboat made on Man-O-War Cay, the nearby island long known for its
excellent boatbuilding. Rentals start at $265 for three days for a 5.7m
(19-ft.) Wellcraft boat.
Reserving a boat when you make your hotel and airline reservations is a
good idea, particularly during the busy spring and summer.
Some of America’s most devoted anglers arrive here just to fish the
coast off this cay. You find giant game fish as well as tropical fish in
these waters, including a few dolphinfish, yellowfin tuna, and even the
big game wahoo.
Fishing charters run from $130 to $235 for a half-day and $240 to $350 for
a full day. You can make arrangements through your hotel. The annual
Green Turtle Club Fishing Tournament (% 800-688-4752 or 242-365-
4271) was on hold at press time, but call for information to see whether
it’s on when you visit in May.
Chapter 20: Green Turtle Cay 267

Exploring on Dry Land
Walking in New Plymouth is journeying back in time. To get a taste of
how Green Turtle Cay and the rest of the Abacos came to be, poke
around the Albert Lowe Museum (% 242-365-4094), on Parliament
Street in New Plymouth. Housed in a charming old cottage, the museum
was founded in 1976 by acclaimed local artist Alton Lowe, who named
the place after his father, Albert, a direct descendant of one of the
European-American families who settled the island. Albert was an avid
model shipbuilder; you can see some of his mini-schooners on display,
along with paintings by Alton (whose prints are for sale), timeworn pho-
tographs, and other historical artifacts, some dating back to the 18th
century. Admission is $5 for adults and $2.50 for students; children 5 and
under are free. The museum is usually open Monday through Saturday
from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. and closed for lunch between 11:45 a.m. and 1 p.m.
Across from New Plymouth Inn on Parliament Street, the Memorial
Sculpture Garden honors residents of the Abacos, both living and 
dead. What blooms in this garden are busts of island notables on stone
pedestals. Read about some of the American Loyalists who came to The
Bahamas from New England and the Carolinas. Statues are also dedicated
to their descendants and to those people who were enslaved in these
islands. You can see everyone from Albert Lowe to African-Bahamian
Jeanne I. Thompson, the second woman to practice law in The Bahamas.
This garden is laid out in the pattern of the British flag.
Living It Up After Dark
On Friday and Saturday nights, a mostly young, local crowd parties to
reggae and calypso music at Rooster’s Rest Pub and Restaurant (% 242-
365-4066) on Gilliam’s Bay Road, just outside New Plymouth. During the
week, the island’s calypso-reggae band, the Gully Roosters, plays at the
Green Turtle Club (% 800-688-4752 or 242-365-4271) one night and at
Bluff House (% 242-365-4247) another night. Both “venues” are on the
northern end of the island.
Those fruity, rum-based cocktails known as Goombay Smashes are all
over Green Turtle Cay. But Miss Emily’s Blue Bee Bar (% 242-365-4181),
located on Victoria Street in New Plymouth is supposedly the birthplace
of this beloved, much-imitated drink. Of course, the original recipe, cre-
ated by the late Miss Emily, is a well-kept secret. Everyone from Bahamian
prime ministers to international TV stars has entered this tiny, unassum-
ing hangout. Miss Emily’s is open Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
until “whenever.”

Going Beyond Green Turtle Cay
One of the island’s best aquatic adventures is a day sail with Brendal’s
Dive Center (% 242-365-4411), located at the Green Turtle Club Marina.
Whether you’re a snorkeler or a scuba diver, the highlight is hand-feeding
graceful stingrays. Because you’re giving them snacks, they aren’t inter-
ested in nibbling on you. If you don’t know how to snorkel or scuba dive,
Brendal’s is a good place to learn.
On the trip, you stop at a secluded beach on an island so small that you
can circle it on foot in 20 minutes. After catching some fish or lobster,
your captain grills it right on the beach and serves it along with conch
salad, homemade bread, and a green salad. The weather, sea conditions,
and your preferences determine exactly where else you go. Brendal man-
ages to strike that rare balance between pure professionalism and laid-
back flexibility, so you can design almost any trip you want.
For the most relaxing, intimate scuba or snorkeling excursion, make a
special request for the sailboat that carries a minimum of four and a
maximum of eight passengers. Otherwise, you’ll probably travel in a
motorboat that holds up to 24 divers (although that many divers are
rarely on board).

Post Office
Open Monday through Friday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
the post office (% 242-365-4242) is on

Safety
Green Turtle Cay is a very safe island.
However, you still need to take the same
precautions that you should take anywhere
you go: Keep valuables in a safe place and
don’t go into deserted, unfamiliar areas
alone at night.
Taxis
Taxis meet incoming flights at the Treasure
Cay Airport, and they greet arriving ferries
as well. During your stay, the staff at your
hotel can call a taxi for you whenever you
want.

Treasure Cay
In This Chapter
 Traveling on Treasure Cay
 Reviewing Treasure Cay’s accommodations and restaurants
 Enjoying watersports and land-based attractions
A
ttractive condos and villas, a championship golf course, a marina,
and a golden sand beach draw visitors to Treasure Cay, especially
in winter.
Treasure Cay is a resort area, not an island — at least not anymore 
(see the sidebar “When an island isn’t an island” later in this chapter).
This resort area looks and feels like the planned vacation community
that it is — a bit sterile for our tastes. Don’t be surprised if your stay
makes you forget that you’re in The Bahamas.
Not much existed here before Treasure Cay was born in the 1960s, so
don’t expect to find any historic sites or long-standing communities full
of local color. The good news is that you can sail to nearby islands —
Green Turtle Cay, Man-O-War Cay, and Elbow Cay — to visit three of The
Bahamas’ oldest and most charming villages.
Arriving at the Airport
Treasure Cay International Airport (% 242-365-0605) is one of the
three airports in the Abacos. Taxis meet arriving flights, and they charge
about $15 for one or two people for the 10- to 15-minute ride to the
Treasure Cay resorts.
Choosing Your Location
You have a choice of two settings: either at a 150-slip marina, one of the
best boat hangouts in the islands; or on a 5.6km (31⁄2-mile) beach of stark
white sand and calm, clear water.
Most vacationers rent golf carts or bikes to get to local restaurants and
to explore their surroundings. The marina and golf course are close to

both hotels. At the shopping center near the marina, you find the bank,
post office, grocery store, and car rental and sports shops, along with
two souvenir stores.
Getting Around Treasure Cay
Renting a car isn’t necessary. To get where you’re going, you can walk,
bike, rent a golf cart, or take a taxi. Some restaurants outside the resort
even send a shuttle to pick you up from your hotel.
 Taking a taxi: Except for moving between the airport or ferry dock
and your hotel, you won’t need a cab. For details about taxi fares,
call the Treasure Cay Airport Taxi Stand (% 242-365-8661). For
that special occasion when you need airport pickups or a trip to
dinner in style, call Elegante Limo Service (% 242-365-8248 or
242-365-8053; $115 an hour for up to ten passengers); this company
also rents golf carts.
 Driving around: The only real reason to rent a car is for the 35-
minute drive to Marsh Harbour to catch the ferries to Elbow Cay
and Man-O-War Cay, two offshore islands. (See the “Going Beyond
Treasure Cay” section later in this chapter.) If you decide you want
to do so, you can rent a car for $70 a day at the Cornish Car Rental,
Treasure Cay Airport (% 242-365-8623). A more scenic way to get
to these islands is to rent or charter a boat from Treasure Cay. (See
recommendations later in this chapter.)
 Wheeling around on a bicycle or golf cart: Through Wendell’s
Bicycle Rentals (% 242-365-8687), across from the bank in the
Treasure Cay shopping center, you can rent beach cruisers (single-
gear bikes with wide wheels) or mountain bikes for $7 a day or $41
a week. Four-seater electric golf carts go for $40 a day or $245 a
week through Wendell’s or Claridge Golf Carts (% 242-365-8248
or 242-365-8053), just outside town.
Staying in Style
The two hotels here offer a variety of accommodations, from standard
rooms and suites to apartments and villas.
Rooms can be scarce in May when the place is packed with fishing 
fanatics angling for fame in the Treasure Cay Billfish Championship.
In addition to the cay’s two main hotels, you can also arrange condo
rentals. The best agency for this service is Bahama Beach Club (% 800-
563-0014 in the U.S. or Canada). A three-night minimum stay is required,
and prices are $315 per night for a two-bedroom unit, $350 per night for
a three-bedroom unit, and $400 per night for a four-bedroom unit.

Treasure Cay Beach
Banyan Beach Club offers 21 spacious condos (ideal for families) in a
prime location — right on the beach that’s widely known as one of the best
in The Bahamas because of its gentle curve, white sand, and turquoise
water. Some of these one- and two-bedroom units have an additional sleep-
ing area: a loft with two twin beds, which you reach by a spiral or ladder-
style staircase. Queen-size beds are in downstairs rooms. Patios or
balconies have expansive views. The one-bedroom units face the swim-
ming pool, while the larger apartments, with two or three bathrooms, over-
look the beach. All units come with kitchens complete with a dishwasher,
microwave, blender, and coffeemaker. The upstairs apartments in both
shingle-roof buildings have high-angled ceilings. Guests get acquainted at
the Monday night cocktail parties or over hamburgers and hot dogs at the
beach bar and grill. Treasure Cay’s golf course is within strolling distance,
but most people get there on the golf carts they rent to cruise the resort.
You can easily arrange watersports at the Treasure Cay Marina.

One of the biggest of the Out Island resorts, this property attracts boaters,
golfers, fishermen, and divers, as well as escapists seeking a remote retreat.
Guests appreciate the House and Garden–style architecture, the spectacu-

most accommodations overlook the dozens of sailing crafts moored in
Treasure Cay Marina. The deluxe suites are very attractive, with fully
equipped kitchens and two bathrooms. Renowned architect Dick Wilson
designed the 18-hole golf course. Tennis courts are lit for night play, and
you can rent watersports equipment. Guests sometimes rent electric golf
carts (around $35 per day) or bikes to explore the far-flung palm and casua-
rina groves of the sprawling property. For a full review of the resort’s restau-
rant, The Spinnaker, see the “Dining Out” section later in this chapter.

Dining Out
Many vacationers to Treasure Cay stay in accommodations with kitchens
or kitchenettes. However, if you know you’re never going to feel like put-
ting fire to a pan, consider purchasing your hotel’s meal plan or dine at
nearby local restaurants, some of which provide transportation.
You can find rather standard food at the Beach Bar & Grill at the Banyan
Beach Club (% 242-365-8111), which opens daily from 11:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Platters of food cost from $4 to $8. Another eatery worth considering is
the roadside Coconut’s on Queen’s Highway (% 242-365-8885), which
serves typically Bahamian fare, such as grouper and conch along with a

Exploring the Sand and Surf
Highlighted by the Treasure Cay Billfish Championship each spring,
watersports in Treasure Cay mean big fun. Golfers don’t have to head to
Nassau or Freeport for a great game. Treasure Cay may be far less devel-
oped than the more popular islands, but its golf course is a big draw.
Combing the beaches
If you desire a beach with some of the softest, whitest sand you can
imagine, and water in some of the most amazing shades of blue and
green, then Treasure Cay Beach is for you. What’s especially alluring
about this beach is that — unlike eye-catching strands on busier, more
built-up islands — this shore is never crowded because it extends for
5.5km (21⁄2 miles).
Playing in the surf
Treasure Cay’s excellent boating, fishing, scuba diving, and snorkeling
make it tempting to spend most of your time in the water.
Chapter 21: Treasure Cay 275

Certified divers can hook up with Treasure Divers (% 242-365-8582;
www.treasure-divers.com). A shorter one-tank dive goes for $83 and a
longer two-tank dive for $83. J.I.C. Boat Rentals (% 242-365-8582; www.
richsrentals.com) can book you on a snorkel sail ($35 per person
with a six-person minimum) or on a beach snorkel trip ($68 per person),
after which the freshly caught grouper and lobster are grilled right on
the beach.
Climbing aboard
Treasure Cay makes a good starting point for exploring the Abacos by 
sea. At Rich’s Boat Rentals (% 242-365-8465; www.richsrentals.com),
boats ranging from 6 to 8m (21–27 ft.) start at around $130 a day. A guided
charter starts at about $250 for a half-day or $400 for a full day. With 7 to
8m (24–26 ft.) fully equipped boats, J.I.C. Boat Rentals (% 242-365-8582)
is another good outfit.
Treasure Cay’s surrounding waters offer some of the country’s best fish-
ing, including deep-sea, sea-bottom, and drift fishing. Off the coast, fish-
ermen pursue barracuda, grouper, yellowtail, snapper, tuna, marlin,
dolphinfish, and wahoo. The cay’s own bonefish flats are just a short
boat ride from the Treasure Cay Marina. Charters start at $425 for a half-
day and $550 for a full day. Make arrangements through your hotel,
Treasure Cay Marina (% 242-365-8250), Rich’s Boat Rentals, or J.I.C.
Boat Rentals.
Exploring on Dry Land
If you prefer to stick to dry land, check out the following options.
The Treasure Cay Golf Club (% 242-365-8535) at the Treasure Cay
Resort & Marina offers one of the best courses in The Bahamas. The
course is a 72-par 18-holer. Greens fees run $63 for 18 holes or $58 for 9.
Reserving tee times is necessary from October to June.
Treasure Cay Hotel Resort & Marina (% 242-365-8250) offers six
tennis courts — three clay surfaces ($16 per hour) and three hard sur-
faces ($14 per hour) — all lit for night play. Check with the hotel to make
arrangements to play.
Living It Up After Dark
Fishermen, yachties, and hotel guests head for the Tipsy Seagull Bar at
the Treasure Cay Hotel Resort & Marina (% 242-365-8535), which pres-
ents live music in winter (only on Fri and Sat nights in the off season).
When a fishing tournament is on island, this bar is jampacked. The set-
ting is an A-frame, and the décor is nautical memorabilia. Bar patrons
who want to hang out can order such treats as pizza and lobster from
Part V: The Abacos: Prime Out Islands

the resort’s adjoining restaurant, The Spinnaker. Happy hour is nightly
from 5 to 7 p.m. The bar closes in autumn, in the early winter months,
and during other slow periods.
Going Beyond Treasure Cay
You can get some local flavor and a blast from the past if you sail off to
one, two, or three of the Abacos’ nearby historic villages.
Trip #1: Green Turtle Cay
A brief ferry ride takes you across the water to Green Turtle Cay, one of
the prettiest islands in The Bahamas. The hamlet of New Plymouth may
make you think that you landed in Cape Cod because it shares a similar
architectural heritage with that New England summer haunt. White
picket fences enclose the front yards of the small clapboard houses. In
this subtropical village, these buildings are trimmed in pastel pinks,
blues, and greens and are shaded by bushy palm trees. Once the most
prosperous settlement in the Abacos, New Plymouth was founded by
British Loyalists who fled the U.S. after the American Revolution. Stroll
around the quiet streets, sip a Goombay Smash, stop for a meal, and
visit the art and maritime museum.
The ferry from Treasure Cay to Green Turtle Cay runs several times a
day. To get to the ferry dock from the Treasure Cay Hotel, you have to
take a 15-minute taxi ride to the departure dock. This ride costs $15 for
one or two passengers. Before long, the ferry pulls up to New Plymouth
(about $11 round-trip for adults and $7 for children). For more details
about hotels, restaurants, sights, and activities on Green Turtle Cay,
check out Chapter 20.
Trip #2: Elbow Cay and Man-O-War Cay
Elbow Cay and Man-O-War Cay, two nearby islands, make wonderful
boating targets. The red-and-white striped lighthouse in Elbow Cay’s
Hope Town Harbour, in Hope Town, is the most photographed man-
made attraction in the Out Islands. Sandy dunes back some of the broad,
quiet beaches on this long, slim island. Saltbox houses with picket
fences make this another contender for a Cape Cod fishing village look-
alike. Take a load off at one of the harborside bars and restaurants.
To reach Man-O-War Cay from Hope Town, you must return to Marsh
Harbour, where you can catch a ride aboard Albury’s Ferry Service 
(% 242-367-3147). Ferries leave daily at 10:30 a.m., 4 p.m., and 5:30 p.m.;
the cost is $15 per passenger. Once you arrive at Man-O-War Cay, you can
wander through its trim streets lined with brightly painted cottages.
You’ll notice something different right away: Unlike most of The Bahamas
(where the majority of residents are of African ancestry), nearly every-
one here is a direct descendant of one European American couple who
settled the island in the 1820s.

In The Bahamas, you can expect to find at least one small bar for every
small church, but not on Man-O-War Cay. You’ll see cozy houses of wor-
ship, but you won’t find any bars or liquor stores at all. Folks on this
uncrowded island take their religion very seriously. Don’t risk offending
anyone by publicly sipping any beer or other alcohol you may have
brought along or by walking around in your bathing suit or other skimpy
attire.
Residents and visitors celebrate Man-O-War Cay’s boat-building history
at the waterfront Sail Shop (% 242-365-6014), which offers colorful
bags handmade from the canvas once used for all those sails. The shop
is open Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. and until 4 p.m. on
Saturday.
To strike out on your own or for a guided charter, contact Rich’s Boat
Rentals (% 242-365-8465) or J.I.C. Boat Rentals (% 242-365-8582). A
trip from Treasure Cay to Man-O-War Cay (45 minutes on a good day)
takes about an hour on the water. A trip from Treasure Cay to Elbow Cay
takes about ten minutes more.
For a different kind of scenic adventure, you can also rent a car in
Treasure Cay (from $75 per day), drive 35 minutes to Marsh Harbour,
and then take the 20-minute ferry ride (through Albury’s Ferry Service)
to Elbow Cay or Man-O-War Cay. To either island, the fare is $8 each way
or $15 same-day round-trip for adults; and $8 one-way or $6 same-day
round-trip for children ages 6 to 12. Your time is limited by the ferry
schedule, however, so you’ll probably make it to only one of the two
islands. (For information about Elbow Cay’s hotels, restaurants, and
sightseeing opportunities, see Chapter 19.)

Post Office
In the Treasure Cay shopping center near
the marina, the post office (% 242-365-

9 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Safety
Although Treasure Cay is a safe resort,
don’t forget to take the same precautions
that you should whether you’re at home or
on vacation: Keep valuables in a safe place
and don’t go into deserted, unfamiliar areas
alone at night.
Taxis
Taxis meet incoming flights at the airport.
During your stay, staff at your hotel can call

The Out Islands

In this part . . . 
W
e journey to four of The Bahamas’ most appealing 
Out Islands. This section reviews one of the most
intriguing of all Bahamian islands — actually a series of
islands — called Eleuthera. A slender wisp of an island, visi-
tors go to Eleuthera mainly for its offshore Harbour Island.
Harbour Island is known for its attractive 18th-century har-
borside houses and its small hotels overlooking a pink-sand
beach. The island of Exuma is sailing heaven, and avid scuba
divers ﬂock to San Salvador.
In this part, you ﬁnd all the information that you need for a
great trip to the Out Islands. We include tips on how to get
there, what to see and do when you’re there, and where you
can ﬁnd the best accommodations and food and the liveliest
nightlife.

f you’re looking for a small, sophisticated hotel on a never-crowded
sandy shore, head to Harbour Island. This little cay off northern
Eleuthera is home to The Bahamas’ coziest collection of distinctive
oceanfront accommodations. This sandy stretch is pink. Mother Nature
created this stunning pastel hue over the eons by pulverizing coral and
shells. Scoop up a handful of the speckled sand, and you’ll see what we
mean.
Arriving in Harbour Island
Harbour Island, 2.4km (11⁄2 miles) off the coast of Eleuthera (see Chap-
ter 23), is one of those special places that requires a bit of work and
patience to reach. If you come by air, you need to fly into the small,
unassuming North Eleuthera Airport (from Miami, Ft. Lauderdale, or
Nassau). Then you take a five-minute taxi ride to the dock (about $4 per
person) and a ten-minute ferry ride to Harbour Island’s Government
Dock ($5 per person). Next, unless you’re staying at The Landing, which
is just across the road, you take a short taxi ride to your hotel ($4 per
person).
Another way you can get to Harbour Island is to board a speedy 177-
passenger catamaran in Nassau. Just contact Bahamas Fast Ferry
(% 242-323-2166; www.bahamasferries.com). You begin this two-hour
trip at the Potters Cay Dock, which is under the bridge leading from
Paradise Island to downtown Nassau. The fare for one of these daily
excursions is $110 round-trip or $65 one-way for adults; and $70 round-
trip or $45 one-way for children ages 2 to 11. The ferry also pulls up to
Harbour Island’s Government Dock, where taxis wait to take you to your
hotel.

Harbour Island
Part VI: The Out Islands 
284
Choosing Your Location
If Harbour Island (called “Briland” by locals) had only the beautiful
beach and the great hotels, it still would be a top-notch vacation choice.
But this island also offers the well-preserved 17th-century Dunmore
Town, the first capital of The Bahamas. Dunmore Town is within walking
distance (or biking and golf-cart reach) of all accommodations. The
western shore offers panoramic sunsets, and Pink Sand Beach along the
eastern coast is the only place to be at sunrise.
What little after-dark action the island does have “jumps up” on week-
ends at or close to the hotels.

Getting Around Harbour Island
Harbour Island is very small — just 5km (3 miles) long and less than a
kilometer (1⁄2-mile) wide — so you can get where you need to go easily.
Here’s a closer look at transportation choices.
 Taking a taxi: The island is so small that you really need a cab only
when arriving and leaving with luggage. Taxis wait for incoming fer-
ries at Government Dock, and the staff at your hotel can call a cab
for you whenever you need one.
 Hoofing it: On this compact island, Dunmore Town (which is ideal
for strolling), restaurants, nightspots, and most other places are
within walking distance of the hotels. The best place to go for a
leisurely walk is the 5km (3-mile) Pink Sand Beach along the eastern
shore.
 Wheeling around: You don’t see many cars on Harbour Island’s
nearly deserted roads. If you do feel the need to move faster than
your feet can carry you, call Michael’s Cycles (% 242-333-2384),
on Colebrook Street. You can choose among bicycles ($12 per day),
two-seater scooters ($30 per day), and four-person golf carts ($48
per day).
Staying in Style
Most hotels in Harbour Island are expensive. Some daily rates appear
high — until you notice that the rates include breakfast and dinner.
If you stay in a moderately priced or inexpensive hotel, you can still
treat yourself to the fancy resorts and restaurants by dining at them now
and then, and you always have access to that dreamy pink beach. See
the Harbour Island map in this chapter for more information on the
island’s accommodations.
No matter your location, you receive as much — or as little — personal
attention as you want. Your accommodations may even have an honor
bar, where you just sign for whatever drinks you fix yourself.
Most hotels and restaurants close during parts of September, October,
and November. Also, because most of the resorts are on a bluff high
above the sand, stairs lead from them down to the coast.
Coral Sands
$$$
On the beach
You can sleep especially well at this sprawling 39-room beach resort where
the owner, who also owns a Connecticut-based bedding company, replaced
all the mattresses with the company’s super-durable, super-comfortable
Chapter 22: Harbour Island 285

brand. Coral Sands, which dates back to the 1960s, exchanged its former
retro look for a totally fresh face. Done in tones of pink and turquoise,
guest rooms are decorated with wicker furniture and attractive artwork.
Some units contain balconies or patios. The rooms have various sizes and
views, but all are in buildings surrounded by greenery. In the newest of
these blocks of buildings, four oceanfront one-bedroom apartments with
wraparound decks can be turned into two- or three-bedroom units by
adding adjoining rooms.
A favorite spot is the spacious Beach Bar, on a deck hanging high over the
pink shore. Lunches and light suppers are served here. You can have ele-
gant dinners at Coral Sands Restaurant, located on a broad veranda in the
main building.

Dunmore Beach Club
$$$$$
On the beach
On a bluff above the pink sand beach, this 15-room inn is the quintessen-
tial elegant hideaway, with 3 hectares (8 acres) of lush, well-manicured
grounds. The comfortable “rooms,” simply decorated in tranquil colors,
are scattered cottages with private patios that have views of the water.
The bathrooms in ten of the rooms contain hot tubs that are large enough
for romantic trysts, and the shower stalls are spacious as well. A tennis
court is on-site, and rates include three top-notch meals a day. A stairway
connects the hotel to the beach.
If you’d rather have a root canal than wear a jacket or a cocktail dress to
dinner, don’t check in here. Dunmore Beach Club isn’t the only Harbour
Island hotel where guests dress up at night, but it is a bit on the stuffy side.
This hotel was once the hangout of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor and
their friends, and a subdued, slightly stiff atmosphere of the private club
it once was still lingers.

The Landing
$$$–$$$$
Dunmore Town
This intimate inn is understated, tasteful, and lovely, giving you a touch of
class like Dunmore Beach Club but for less money. Set in buildings that
have stood here since the early 1800s, this small inn is located in the heart
of historic Dunmore Town. Its owner is India Hicks, the daughter of the
Part VI: The Out Islands 
286

famed London decorator David Hicks, and a bridesmaid to Lady Diana
during her wedding to Prince Charles. The seven guest rooms are deco-
rated plantation-style, with mahogany-stained four-poster beds and 
hardwood floors. Some rooms have broad verandas and ceiling fans, and
most of them look out to the harbor across the road. The restaurant is
reason enough to stay here. (See a review of this restaurant in the “Dining
Out” section later in this chapter.) To reach the beach, you have to go all
the way across Harbour Island — however, this feat is hardly a difficult one.
If you’re traveling with children, ask for a room with an extra single bed.
See map p. 284. Bay Street, across from Government Dock. % 242-333-2707. Fax:
242-333-2650. www.harbourislandlanding.com. Rack rates: $240–$345 double.
Rates include breakfast. MC, V.
Pink Sands
$$$$$
On the beach
This 25-room inn, set on 8 hectares (20 acres) adjacent to the beach, is the
epitome of Out Island chic. It’s a classier joint than even the Dunmore
Beach Club, its chief rival. You won’t find a better hideaway or honeymoon
retreat in all The Bahamas. The Pink Sands is also less snobbish and a lot
hipper than the Dunmore. Jamaican-born Chris Blackwell, who brought Bob
Marley to world attention, took over Pink Sands in 1992 and transformed it
from a hurricane-ravaged inn into the pocket of posh that it is today.
The airy, spacious bedrooms have either an ocean or a garden view.
Smaller units contain Art Deco touches straight out of Miami’s South
Beach; larger, more expensive units feature Indonesian (especially
Balinese) furnishings and art, as well as huge decks. All rooms have kitch-
enettes or kitchens, central air-conditioning, pressurized water systems,
walk-in closets, satellite TV, CD players and a CD selection, wet bars, pri-
vate patios with teak furnishings, and beautifully tiled bathrooms. The
rooms also have dataports, and the staff can supply you with fax machines
and cellphones, if you need them.
When not on the beach, guests head for the swimming pool, the tennis
courts (one is lit for night play), the exercise room, or the library. You can
have breakfast and dinner surrounded by leafy greenery on the main
dining terrace. (The daily rates include a full breakfast and the four-course
candlelit evening meal.) The beachside Blue Bar serves lunch and hosts
the Saturday night Bahamian barbecues. For a few extra bucks, you can
even order room service, an alien concept at most Out Island hotels.
See map p. 284. Chapel Street. % 800-OUTPOST (800-688-7678) or 242-333-2030. Fax:

cottage, from $1,300 two-bedroom cottage. Rates include breakfast and dinner. AE,

Runaway Hill Club
$$$$
On the beach
Guests who first meet at Runaway Hill often book their next vacations
together here the following year. Because this inn has only ten rooms
(most with patios or balconies), everyone quickly gets to know each other.
Set on a rise high above the swimming pool and beach (accessible by stair-
case), the main building was once a private home. With its individually and
beautifully decorated rooms, it looks as if it still is. Our favorite place to
sleep is the huge downstairs room with ceramic floor tiles in an intricate
pink pattern and a spacious bathroom with twin sinks. The more modern
rooms, in a separate hilltop villa, are more similar in size and décor. No
matter where you stay, you find artfully arranged furnishings and well-
maintained private bathrooms. Guests dress up for the elegant candlelit
dinners here, joined by those lucky non-guests who’ve managed to reserve
tables as well. The friendly staff is always on hand to help make arrange-
ments for watersports and other activities.
See map p. 284. Colebrook Street, Central Harbour Island. % 242-333-2150. Fax:

extra per person. MC, V. No children under 18 accepted. Closed Sept to mid-Nov.
Tingum Village
$
Southern Harbour Island
You won’t find anything fancy about Tingum Village, and with just 19
rooms in cottages with large terraces, “village” is certainly a misnomer.
However, the village’s proximity to the island’s beach (a four-minute walk
away), its excellent Bahamian restaurant, Ma Ruby’s (see our review in
the “Dining Out” section below), and the friendliness of the staff, all make
up for the lack of bells and whistles common at pricier Harbour Island
hotels. A local family runs this quiet, low-key establishment. The hotel
feels more like the “real” Bahamas than most of the island’s more polished
but foreign-owned and managed accommodations. The neat, clean rooms
look out to a grassy expanse edged by palms, hibiscus, and other vegeta-
tion. If you want a hot tub in your room, book one of the two suites.
See map p. 284. Colebrook Street. % 242-333-2161. Fax: 242-333-2161. Rack rates:

Dining Out
For such a small island, a surprising selection of first-rate dining rooms,
most of them at hotels, awaits you.
Dinner reservations are crucial, and you may need to make yours in the
morning. Vacationers tend to dress up for dinner, especially at the more
expensive resorts during the winter season. On the other hand, local
Part VI: The Out Islands 
288

spots featuring home-style Bahamian cooking are casual affairs. The
majority of restaurants close between meals, and some restaurants also
close completely for varying periods of time between September and
November.
Angela’s Starfish

Just outside Dunmore Town
BAHAMIAN
For more than a quarter century, this family-run restaurant has been
churning out Bahamian dishes that keep folks streaming through the
doors. Sit inside, where the casual décor has nautical touches, or on the
palm-shaded lawn overlooking the water and mainland Eleuthera. At night,
tiny bulbs hidden inside conch shells illuminate the tables. The honey-
brown cracked conch is the perfect combination of crispy on the outside
and tender on the inside. You can order fish, chicken, and pork chops, all
served with mounds of peas and rice and all of which are also well pre-
pared. Key lime and coconut pie are the featured desserts.
You’re welcomed here as long as you heed the sign that requests that
patrons refrain from swearing and wearing bare-backed clothing.

At the Coral Sands resort, this casual restaurant and bar has a long lunch

sands. You can sit at tables on a sunny deck hanging high above the rosy
sand — the spot is perfect for a long, tall rum punch. You can order an
early lunch or a very late lunch. Begin with conch fritters, the conch salad,
the conch chowder, or the cracked conch. Main courses focus on sand-
wiches; one is made with rock lobster, and another with roast beef. If you
like something more substantial, order the grilled New York strip steak or
the catch of the day cooked to your specifications.

Signature dishes include white conch chowder and lobster served with
asiago cheese and a sauvignon blanc white sauce. Taste these dishes and
you’ll know at once why this dining room is one of the island’s finest. Most
diners wisely opt for one of the delectable fish dishes, including herb-
crusted grouper or filet of snapper with fresh citrus chunks and a pinot
sauce. Meat dishes, all imported, range from a tender prime Angus beef
sirloin steak to New Zealand lamb chops. For dessert, you can finish off
with a yummy chocolate torte.

see and be seen. Along the water across the street, vendors sell straw
goods, fruit, and vegetables. After dinner, a very local crowd gathers at the
bar. Specialties include the blackened grouper, garlic shrimp with pasta,
lobster, cracked conch, and Key lime pie. The food is some of the most sat-

The cozy atmosphere of this intimate restaurant makes it clear that the

dine in the bright yellow and white dining room or in the garden. Linens
and fine china dress the tables, where you sit in saddle-back chairs. The
restaurant always features a first-rate chef whose cooking pays tribute to
the aristocratic credentials of the place. For your evening meal, you can
choose among rock Cornish hen, cappellini with lobster, and Angus beef.
The golden-brown, pan-fried grouper with mashed potatoes, eggplant, and
green salsa is another bestseller. Dessert offerings may include ice cream,
sorbet, and rich but surprisingly light chocolate cake, followed by various
gourmet coffees.

Rock House Restaurant
$$$
Dunmore Town
INTERNATIONAL
This restaurant feels like a hip bodega in Miami. It has lots of varnished
mahogany, pale yellow walls, spinning ceiling fans and, in addition to the
table groupings for groups of two and four diners, a very large “chef’s
table” with 16 chairs (reputedly among the furnishings in Washington,
D.C.’s White House before a long-ago refurbishment). Lunches are charm-
ing but rather simple affairs, with dishes such as burgers, rock lobster
salad sandwiches, and conch chowders. Dinners are more elaborate 
and more of a showcase for the chef. The best menu items include “Ying-
yang” soup, crafted from roasted red and yellow peppers with smoked
Chapter 22: Harbour Island 291

mozzarella and chile oil; chicken with Asian noodles and a tahini-flavored
aioli; crab cakes served with a confit of sweet peppers and béarnaise
sauce; grilled lobster tail with clarified butter; and tiger-shrimp spaghetti
with local goat cheese, peppers, and parsley. Especially flavorful is a crispy
pan-fried chicken breast with a citrus-flavored herb sauce.

Runaway Hill Club
$$$$$
On the beach
CONTINENTAL
To see the daily prix-fixe menu, stop by in the morning to read what’s 
on the old brass music stand by the entrance to the inn. Showing up 
early helps you for two reasons: First, dinner reservations go quickly at
Runaway Hill. Second, this wonderfully decorated former home overlook-
ing the ocean is gorgeous by daylight. See it and you just may want to book
a room here for your next vacation. At night, the small, elegant dining room
glows with candlelight. The chef turns out cuisine with skill and a certain
flair, although it doesn’t ever rise to spectacular heights. Your four-course
meal may include lobster bisque followed by seafood pasta with scampi,
pork tenderloin, rack of veal, or veal piccata. Dessert options may include
chocolate pie with walnuts or an imaginative strawberry creation.
The restaurant has just one seating (8 p.m.), following cocktails (7:30 p.m.),
so tables are at a premium. Men wear shirts with collars, and women really
dress up.

vations required. Complete four-course dinner: $60. AE, MC, V. Open: Mon–Sat 8 p.m.
Closed Sept to mid-Nov. No children.
Enjoying the Sand and Surf
Fishing (especially bonefishing), scuba diving, and snorkeling are the
main aquatic diversions. Relaxing on the beach, wandering around his-
toric Dunmore Town, and socializing with residents round out the roster
of activities.
Combing the beach
Pink Sand Beach is truly amazing. Nearly five exquisite kilometers 
(3 miles) of mostly unpopulated pink sand run along the eastern coast of
the island. Take a stroll or plan a picnic here, and don’t forget to watch
the sunrise — it’s spectacular. Sunbathing along this calm strand is best
in the morning.
Part VI: The Out Islands 
292

Playing in the surf
You may not be able to see forever in these waters, but on a clear day,
visibility is often as good as 61m (200 ft.). This area boasts a diversity of
dive sites.
In Current Cut, between Eleuthera and Current Island, experienced
scuba divers can drift dive at exhilarating speeds with the current that
rushes through an underwater chasm. The current carries divers
between the rock walls for about a kilometer (a half-mile), along with a
blizzard of reef fish, stingrays, and even some mako sharks. Another
exceptional dive site is the wreck of a 60m (197-ft.) steel freighter that
sank in 1917.
For both scuba and snorkeling trips, the place to go is Valentine’s Dive
Center (% 242-333-2080; www.valentinesdive.com), on the harbor
side of the island in the heart of Dunmore Town. A scuba resort course
costs $85. A one-tank dive for certified divers runs $40, and a two-tank
trip is $120. Half-day snorkeling sails cost $40 per person.
For an unusual adventure, certified divers can try reef running, a ride
on an underwater scooter ($120). Decked out in your scuba gear, you
cover much more marine territory than you do with regular diving.
Climbing aboard
You can rent a motorboat through Michael’s Cycles (% 242-333-2384
or 242-464-0994) on Colebrook Street near Seagrapes nightclub. Plan to
spend about $65 for a half-day or $75 for a full day on a 4m (13-ft.) boat
and $125 for a half-day or $175 for a full day on a 5m (17-ft.) boat. Kayaks
here go for $40 a day.
You can make arrangements for fishing guides and charters through
your hotel or by contacting Valentine’s Dive Center (% 242-333-2080),
on the harbor side of the island in Dunmore Town. Deep-sea fishing trips
start at $550 for a half-day or $750 for a full day.
Exploring on Dry Land
Dunmore Town, located on the harbor side of Harbour Island, was
named for the 18th-century royal governor of The Bahamas who helped
develop it and who had a summer home here. You can walk around
these narrow, virtually car-free lanes in less than 20 minutes, or you can
stroll slowly to savor the sight of the old gingerbread cottages that line
the waterfront. Overhung with orange, purple, and pink bougainvillea,
white picket fences enclose these wooden houses painted pastel blue,
green, and lilac. Wind chimes tinkle in front of shuttered windows, and
coconut palms and wispy casuarina pines shade grassy yards.
Chapter 22: Harbour Island 293

Americans and Canadians own some of these houses, which have whim-
sical names, such as “Up Yonder” and “Beside the Point,” instead of
house numbers. You can rent a few of these houses when you vacation
here. One of the oldest, Loyalist Cottage, was built in 1797. It survives
from the days when the original settlers, loyal to the British Crown, left
the American colonies after the Revolutionary War. The porches along
the harbor make for prime sunset watching. Lucky for you, some
porches aren’t connected to private homes. The terrace at Harbour
Lounge Bar and Restaurant is an idyllic perch. Just across the road from
Loyalist Cottage, you can browse through straw goods, T-shirts, fruits,
and vegetables at the vendors’ stalls.
On Sundays, residents dressed to kill stand in sociable clusters out-
side churches before and after services. Two of The Bahamas’ first
churches are in Dunmore Town and are still going strong: St. John’s, 
The Bahamas’ oldest Anglican church, established in 1768; and Wesley
Methodist Church, built in 1846.
Spend some time wandering the streets — some hilly, some flat — away
from the heart of town. You can see roosters doing their jerky marches
through front yards and horses grazing in small fields. You’ll find unas-
suming but perfectly good Bahamian restaurants, bars, and nightclubs in
this locals’ area.
A Shopper’s Guide to Harbour Island
Dunmore Town is no Nassau, but you can find several stores carrying
items that are worth a look, such as local artists’ works, Androsia resort
wear (made from the colorful batik fabric created on the Bahamian
island of Andros), and handicrafts like music boxes in the shape of
Harbour Island cottages and one-of-a-kind toothbrushes.
The standout boutique is Miss Mae Tea Room and Fine Things (% 242-
333-2002), on Dunmore Street. Among the ever-changing, always-artful,
mostly imported merchandise, you may find Haitian-style paintings,
silver jewelry from Bali, local painted boxes, antique chests, gourmet
wine vinegar from France, and Italian olive oil.
Blue Rooster (% 242-333-2240), in the center of town, offers what may
be the most upscale and stylish collection of men’s and women’s cloth-
ing and (casual) evening wear on the island. Come here for something
sporty to wear to a posh hotel’s dining room, especially if the button-
down look appeals to you. The Shop at The Landing (% 242-333-2707),
at The Landing Resort, usually wins as the most stylish clothing store on
the island. It focuses on fashionable sportswear and clothes that you
can wear to a casual island cocktail party, a posh brunch, or a buffet
dinner aboard a yacht.
Part VI: The Out Islands 
294

You may also want to check out Princess Street Gallery (% 242-333-
2788), where Charles Carey restored an ancestral home and uses it to
display works by local artists.
A few vendors sell fruit, vegetables, T-shirts, and straw goods (baskets,
bags, hats, place mats) along Bay Street, at the edge of the harbor. You
can hone your bargaining skills at this open-air mini-marketplace.
Living It Up After Dark
During the week, life after dark means hanging out at hotel and restau-
rant bars. Some resorts offer live music with dinner two evenings a
week. The other nightspots see most of their action on weekends. The
youngest, liveliest local crowd gravitates toward Seagrapes (no phone),
a large club at Colebrook and Gibson streets. On Friday or Saturday,
you’re likely to catch a live band here, but the dance floor is packed
even when a DJ reigns.
The poolroom at the Vic-Hum Club (% 242-333-2161), on Barrack
Street, is another popular haunt. Calypso, American pop, and R&B
pumps from the speakers, and classic record album sleeves decorate the
walls and ceilings. Ask the owner to show you “the world’s largest
coconut,” which measures some 84cm (33 in.) around.
Pool, satellite TV sports, and periodic live music entertain patrons at
hilltop Gusty’s (% 242-333-2165), on Coconut Grove Avenue in the
north. Get here early enough and nab the perfect perch for sunset
watching.

Eleuthera
In This Chapter
 Getting around Eleuthera
 Reviewing Eleuthera’s best accommodations and restaurants
 Enjoying the island’s beaches, watersports, and land attractions
V
isitors flock to Harbour Island, a small island off the coast of
Eleuthera, to be coddled in comfort, but adventurous travelers
head for “mainland” Eleuthera. Although Harbour Island is flourishing,
the great heyday of tourism for mainland Eleuthera has dwindled since
The Bahamas became independent. Many embittered locals blame the
late Prime Minister Lynden Pindling for discouraging foreign investment.
At one time, some of the best-known names in the world visited
Eleuthera. If celebs come today, they visit Harbour Island, not the main-
land. However, Eleuthera’s natural attractions, which made it alluring in
the first place, are still here to welcome you.
Arriving at the Airports
Eleuthera has two main airports. North Eleuthera Airport (% 242-335-
1242) serves the northern part of the island along with the two major
offshore cays, Harbour Island and Spanish Wells. Governor’s Harbour
Airport (% 242-332-2321) serves the center of the island. A third air-
port at Rock Sound no longer receives as many flights as it used to and
is used mostly by local residents.
When you make your reservations, be sure that your flight will arrive at
the appropriate airport; one visitor flew into Rock Sound Airport only to
face a $100 taxi ride and a water-taxi trip before reaching his final desti-
nation of Harbour Island in the north.
Bahamasair (% 800-222-4262; www.bahamasair.com) offers daily
flights between Nassau and the three airports in Eleuthera. In addition,
several commuter airlines fly from the Florida mainland with either non-
stop or one-stop service. Many private flights use the North Eleuthera
Airport, with its 1,371m (4,500-ft.) paved runway. This airport is an offi-
cial Bahamian port of entry, and a Customs and Immigration official is 
on hand.

USAir Express (% 800-428-4322; www.usairways.com) operates flights
to two of Eleuthera’s airports directly from the mainland of Florida.
Flights depart once a day from Miami and fly nonstop to North Eleuthera
and then continue on, after briefly unloading passengers and baggage, to
Governor’s Harbour. Small carriers include Twin Air (% 954-359-8266;
www.flytwinair.com), which flies from Ft. Lauderdale three times a
week to Rock Sound and Governor’s Harbour and four times a week to
North Eleuthera.
An inter-island link, Bahamas Fast Ferries (% 242-323-2166; www.ferry
bahamas.com), originates in Potter’s Cay, beneath the Paradise Island
Bridge. From there, it leaves at regular intervals for Harbour Island,
North Eleuthera, and Governor’s Harbour. Round-trip fares are $110 for
adults and $70 for children under 12.
Choosing Your Location
The very lack of accommodations will make the location decision for
you. In days of yore, Rock Sound, with its fabled Windermere Club or
Cotton Bay Club, was far chicer than today’s Harbour Island. Chartered
planes carrying CEOs landed several times a day, but those days are
now memories. Except for private villas, Rock Sound is devoid of rentals.
As you leave Rock Sound heading north of its airport, you come to
Tarpum Bay, where you find only a handful of simple inns. North of
here, the settlement of Palmetto Point has a cluster of other modest
villas. In the middle of the island farther north, Governor’s Harbour —
or at least its economy — never recovered from the day a hurricane
washed away Club Med. However, a number of offbeat accommodations,
such as Duck Inn and Orchid Gardens, are far superior to any place
south of Governor’s Harbour.
As you move north into Hatchet Bay and Gregory Town, you come
upon some other modest digs. Although simple, the little mom-and-pop
places are clean, comfortable, well maintained, and affordable. Check
them out.
Getting Around Eleuthera
It’s virtually impossible to get lost on Eleuthera — only one road mean-
ders along the entire length of its snake-shaped form, and you stray from
it very rarely.
 Taking a taxi: Most visitors take a taxi only when they arrive at one
of the local airports or when they have to return to that airport to go
home. Taxis meet all incoming flights and are also available at ferry
docks. Because cabbies are independent operators on Eleuthera,
you can’t call one central number. If you need to call a taxi, your
Chapter 23: Eleuthera 299

hotel staff can summon one for you, but you may have to wait a
while, so plan ahead.
 Hoofing it: You can easily traverse all the settlements — really,
hamlets, in most cases — on foot. With little traffic on the island,
walking is an enjoyable experience here.
 Wheeling around: You don’t find any American car-rental agencies
on the island. Usually, your hotel staff can arrange for a car rental
(prices are from $80 a day). Often, we’ve ended up with someone’s
private car. The best bet for car rentals is the North Eleuthera-
based Fine Threads Taxi, Rental Cars & Tours (% 242-359-7780
or 242-335-1556). Here, owner Frederick Neely (nicknamed “Fine
Threads” because of his well-tailored clothes) either rents you a
car or takes you on a private island tour. An eight-hour experience
for 2 or 3 people costs $200; 8 to 12 people, $300. Tours usually
begin at 9 a.m. and take in a series of bars, restaurants, and geologi-
cal or historical attractions in Rock Sound, Lower Bogue, Palmetto
Point, and Gregory Town. If you negotiate with your driver, you
may also visit Preacher’s Cave.
 Sailing on a ferry: For information about how to reach Harbour
Island from Eleuthera, refer to Chapter 22. To reach the other off-
shore island, Spanish Wells, take the convenient “on demand” ferry
service (% 242-554-6268) to North Eleuthera. A ferry runs between
Gene’s Bay in North Eleuthera to the main pier at Spanish Wells.
The ferries depart whenever passengers show up, and the cost is
$8 per person round-trip or $4 one-way.
Staying in Style
Because all the luxury properties on Eleuthera have gone belly-up,
nearly every place you stay on the mainland is affordable. If you like to
spend big bucks, you can always sail over to Harbour Island. Otherwise,
you can expect a reasonably priced vacation.
Although we personally like Eleuthera in the late summer and fall when
most visitors have departed, not all inns and hotels are likely to be open,
especially in late September, October, and November. If business is slow,
hoteliers simply close their doors.
Don’t come expecting a lot of personal attention. Eleuthera caters to
self-sufficient types. We often met the hotel owner when checking into a 
rental and didn’t see him or her again until we paid the bill.

such sports as kayaking, Hobie Catting, snorkeling, and windsurfing.
Scuba-diving trips and deep-sea fishing can also be arranged. The spacious
and handsomely furnished bedrooms are spread over a trio of pastel-
painted cottages in a tropical garden. The accommodations are furnished
with teak from Bali and Italian ceramics. Each unit is a suite unto itself with
a hammock-hung patio. Some of the bedrooms have a comfortable sofa

11 hectares (27 acres) partially planted with pineapples; it consists of a
main clubhouse and eight tropical-style bungalows, each containing four

charm. Each one has tile floors and a porch, with no TVs or phones to dis-
tract you. All accommodations, each with a spacious living area, are
equipped with a bathroom that includes a shower stall.
The restaurant (see listing later in the “Dining Out” section) serves three
meals a day, and the lounge and poolside patio are open daily for drinks
and informal meals. Kayaks, bicycles, two tennis courts, and a small fresh-
water pool compete with hammocks for your time. There’s fabulous snor-
keling right off the sands here, with colorful fish darting in and out of the

overlooking the sea. All units come with kitchenettes, air-conditioning, and
TV, but no phone. Nassau-born John (J. J.) Duckworth and his Michigan-
born wife, Katie, along with their son John Lucas, are your hosts. They
spend much of their time nurturing a sprawling collection of beautiful
orchids that they cultivate for export to Europe and the U.S. The collec-
tion of orchids, some 4,000 strong, is one of the largest in North America.

much happens here; you create your own amusement. You can lounge in
a deck chair by the freshwater pool or take in a view of the tropical gar-
dens. A good sandy beach, ideal for both beachcombing and swimming,
is only a five-minute walk away.
Although comfortable and well maintained, the décor of the bedrooms
wouldn’t seem out of place in Miami in the 1960s. Built around the pool, the
bedrooms open onto ocean or garden views. Each has a private balcony
with chairs. If you’re just passing through, consider a stopover here for
lunch, because the Bahamian-style food is good.

Rainbow Inn
$$
Hatchet Bay
Three kilometers (2 miles) north of Alice Town and near a sandy beach, the
Rainbow Inn is a venerable survivor in an area where many competitors
have failed. Quirky and appealing to guests who return for quiet getaways
again and again, it’s an isolated collection of seven cedar-sided octagonal
bungalows. The accommodations are simple but comfortable, spacious,
and tidy; each has a kitchenette, lots of exposed wood, a ceiling fan, a
porch, and a TV, but no phone. A sandy beach is a few steps away, and the
inn offers an on-site saltwater pool along with a tennis court. You can rent
cars, although the inn provides you with bikes and snorkeling gear.
One of the most appealing things about this place is Dolcevita Restaurant
and Lounge — a destination for residents far up and down the length of
Eleuthera. It has live Bahamian music twice a week and one of the most
extensive menus on Eleuthera. The owners take pride that the menu hasn’t
changed much in 20 years — a fact that suits its loyal fans just fine. Table
number two, crafted from a triangular teakwood prow of a motor yacht
that was wrecked off the coast of Eleuthera in the 1970s, is a perpetual
favorite of guests.

Unique Village
$$
Palmetto Point
Located on a steep rise above the Atlantic coast of Eleuthera, this 14-room
hotel is the creative statement of a Palmetto Point businessman who also
owns the local hardware store (Unique Hardware). The hotel, built in 1992,
offers everything from conventional single or double rooms to a one-
bedroom apartment with a kitchenette to two-bedroom villas with full
kitchens. All rooms come with air-conditioning. Wooden steps bring you to
the beach, where a reef breaks up the Atlantic surf and creates calm waters
on this sandy cove. There’s a bar and restaurant, also called Unique Village
(see our review in the “Dining Out” section later in this chapter), but few
other luxuries. Although no sailing, scuba, or tennis is on-site, the staff can
direct you to other facilities within a reasonable drive. (If you stay here,
you’ll probably want to rent a car; for more information on renting a car,
see “Getting Around Eleuthera” earlier in this chapter.)

Dining Out
Food on Eleuthera can be good and substantial, but don’t expect fancy
international restaurants. Your best bet for dining is at one of the few
resorts. Branch out during the day to sample some “Bahama Mama” type
places for island specialties. If you order as many Goombay Smashes as
some of the locals do, you’ll end up loving whatever is served.
Cambridge Villas
$
Gregory Town
BAHAMIAN
This restaurant occupies a large cement-sided room on the ground floor of
a battered hotel (the accommodations aren’t as appealing as the restau-
rant). Harcourt and Sylvia Cambridge, the owners, serve conch burgers,
conch chowder, and sandwiches, usually prepared by Sylvia herself. This
restaurant is just a simple spot where you may be entertained by the con-
tinually running soap operas broadcast from a TV over the bar.

Set beside the swimming pool within the also-recommended Quality Inn
Cigatoo, this is one of the more reliable and substantial dining areas within
a town that isn’t known for a wide variety of choices. Expect a mixture of
Bahamian food with what you’d expect from an out-of-the-way steakhouse

BAHAMIAN/CONTINENTAL
In the previously recommended hotel 2.5km (11⁄2 miles) north of Gregory
Town, this spacious dining room is your best bet in the area, featuring a
gourmet Continental cuisine with local delights as well. The restaurant is
decorated in a light, tropical style. Lunch begins with the inevitable conch
chowder. We recommend you follow it with a conch burger, a generous patty
of ground conch blended with green pepper, onion, and spices. Conch also
appears several times in the evening, and we think this is the best cracked
conch in town, tenderized, dipped in a special batter, and fried to a golden
perfection. The kitchen serves the best fried chicken in the area, too.

Locals hail Muriel Cooper, a grandmother in her 70s, as the best baker in
Eleuthera. Located across from the post office, her little bakery is simple
yet warm and welcoming and filled with pictures of her grandchildren. You
can stop in to stock up on freshly baked cakes, pies, tarts, rolls, and loaves
of bread, which can be ideal for a picnic. Should some fishermen bring her
fresh conch, she’ll make a tasty chowder to go or else the island’s best
conch fritters. You’ll fall for her rich, moist pineapple and coconut cakes
as well.

along with such sides as grits and bacon. Lunchtime features sandwiches,
although you can also order hot plates of food (most often fried grouper).
The dinner menu includes platters of cracked conch, pork chops, and

Hot gossip and cheap, juicy burgers make Sammy’s the most popular hang-
out in Rock Sound — come here for a slice of local life. Sammy’s is on the
northeastern approach to the settlement in a neighborhood that even the
owner refers to as “the back side of town.” Sammy Culmer (who’s assisted
by Margarita, his daughter) will serve you drinks (including Bahama

Mamas and rum punches), conch fritters, Creole-style grouper, breaded
scallops, pork chops, and lobster. If you drop in before 11 a.m., you may
be tempted by a selection of egg dishes or omelets.
This spot is primarily a restaurant and bar, but Sammy does rent four rooms
with air-conditioning and satellite TV, plus two efficiency cottages with two
bedrooms and a kitchen. These accommodations can be yours for $66 per

ular” breakfasts, such as hearty omelets.) Lunch offerings include zesty
conch chowder and an array of salads. You can order burgers or the
steamed catch of the day. At night, the choices grow, and you find the best
New York sirloin available in mid-Eleuthera. Cracked conch fried in a light
beer batter is one of the better versions of this dish on the island.

Enjoying the Sand and Surf
Eleuthera possesses some of the finest beaches in The Bahamas, although
none is as fine as the 5km (3 miles) of pink sands at Harbour Island (see
Chapter 22).
Now relatively deserted, Cape Eleuthera was once home to a chic resort
and yacht club that drew some of the movers and shakers from America’s
East Coast. They’re all gone now, but the three splendid white sandy
beaches remain the same, and locals claim the deep-sea fishing is as fine
as it ever was. Directly north of the town of Tarpum Bay lies Gaulding’s
Cay, a lovely beach of golden sand with exceptional snorkeling.
None of Eleuthera’s beaches has facilities or lifeguards. Whatever 
you need on the beach, you should bring with you, including sunscreen
and water. Don’t expect any touristy kiosks selling drinks, snacks, or
souvenirs — everything is pristine and undeveloped.
Even without its posh hotel, Windermere Island is worth a day trip.
Savannah Sound, with its sandy sheltered beaches and outstanding
snorkeling, is particularly appealing (bring your own gear). You also find
excellent beaches for shelling and picnicking, and bonefishing is good —
with some catches weighing in at more than 4.5 kilograms (10 pounds).
Chapter 23: Eleuthera 307

West Beach, a good place for sunning, swimming, and children, is about
a ten-minute walk from the shut-down Windermere Club. The beach is 
on Savannah Sound, and this body of calm, protected water separates
Windermere from the main island of Eleuthera.
Visitors can enjoy a number of activities, from bonefishing to windsurf-
ing. The dockmaster at West Beach is well qualified to guide and advise
you on bonefishing, or perhaps you prefer going deep-sea fishing for
white marlin, dolphinfish, grouper, wahoo, Allison tuna, and amberjack.
Because no permanent outfitter is on the island, you have to ask around
locally about who can take you out.
At Palmetto Point, site of some villa rentals, you find Ten Bay Beach,
one of the best beaches in The Bahamas, with its sparkling turquoise
water and wide expanse of soft, white sand. The beach is a ten-minute
drive south of Palmetto Point and just north of Savannah Sound. You
won’t find facilities here, only idyllic isolation.
Near the center of Governor’s Harbour you find two sandy beaches
known locally as the Buccaneer Public Beaches; they’re adjacent to 
the Buccaneer Club, on the sheltered western edge of the island, facing
Exuma Sound. Snorkeling is good here; it’s best at the point where the
pale turquoise waters near the coast deepen to a dark blue. Underwater
rocks shelter lots of marine flora and fauna. The waves at these beaches
are relatively calm.
On Eleuthera’s Atlantic (eastern) side, less than a kilometer (a half-mile)
from Governor’s Harbour, is a much longer stretch of mostly pale pink
sand, similar to what you find on Harbour Island. Known locally as the
Club Med Public Beach, it’s good for bodysurfing and, on days when
storms are surging in the Atlantic, even conventional surfing.
Diving isn’t a big sport on mainland Eleuthera. Outfitters come and go
quickly, few getting enough business to hold out until another winter.
But diving is excellent off Harbour Island, where you’ll find some of the
best scuba-diving experts in The Bahamas (see Chapter 22).
Exploring on Dry Land
We like to drive the full 161km (100-mile) length of Eleuthera, stopping
wherever something enchants us. The island doesn’t have any historical
attractions, only those that nature created. We begin our tour in the
south and head north.
Located in South Eleuthera, Rock Sound is a small, shady village. It is
the island’s main town and was once its most exclusive enclave. The
closing of two old-time landmark resorts, the Cotton Bay Club and the
Windermere Club, has — at least for now — halted the flow of famous
visitors, who once included everybody from the late Princess Diana to a
Part VI: The Out Islands 
308

parade of CEOs. No reopenings are yet in sight, but that means you can
have many of South Eleuthera’s best beaches practically to yourself.
Rock Sound opens onto Exuma Sound and is located to the south of
Tarpum Bay. The town is at least two centuries old, and it has many old-
fashioned homes with picket fences out front. Once notorious for wreckers
who lured ships ashore with false beacons, it used to be known as
“Wreck Sound.”
The Ocean Hole, which is about 2km (11⁄4 miles) east of the heart of Rock
Sound, is said to be bottomless. This saltwater lake, which eventually
meets the sea, is one of the most attractive spots on Eleuthera. You can
walk right down to the edge of the water, and you can see many tropical
fish here; they seem to like being photographed — but only if you feed
them first.
After leaving Rock Sound, head south, bypassing the abandoned Cotton
Bay Club, and continue through the villages of Green Castle and Deep
Creek. At this point, you take a sharp turn northwest along the only
road leading to Cape Eleuthera. Locals call this Cape Eleuthera Road,
although you won’t find any markings other than a sign pointing the way.
If you continue following this road northwest, you’ll reach the end of the
island chain, jutting into Exuma Sound.
When you get back on the main road again, you can head north of Rock
Sound for 14km (9 miles) until you come to Tarpum Bay, a charming old
waterfront village. This tiny settlement, with its many pastel-washed,
gingerbread-trimmed houses, is a favorite of artists, who have estab-
lished a small colony here with galleries and studios.
Continue heading north, and you find Windermere Island, which lies
between the settlements of Rock Sound and Governor’s Harbour. To
reach the island, you must cross a small bridge. Once the most exclusive
vacation retreat in The Bahamas, many rich Americans still have second
homes here, and security guards patrol the island.
You may have to do some sweet-talking to get past the security patrols.
They generally let you drive along the island if they think you’re a sight-
seer and not a burglar.
On the east side of Queen’s Highway, south of Governor’s Harbour,
North Palmetto Point is a little village where visitors rarely venture
(although you can get a meal here). This laid-back town will suit you if
you want peace and quiet off the beaten track.
At some 300 years old, Governor’s Harbour is the island’s oldest settle-
ment, reportedly the landing place of the Eleutherian Adventurers, the
island’s original settlers. The largest town on Eleuthera after Rock Sound,
it’s situated midway along the island. The town today has a population of
about 1,500, with some bloodlines going back to the Adventurers and to
Chapter 23: Eleuthera 309

the Loyalists who followed some 135 years later. Many old homes line
streets amid the bougainvillea and casuarina trees.
Leaving Queen’s Highway, you can take a small bridge, thought to be
about 150 years old, to Cupid’s Cay. As you explore the offshore island,
you come upon one of the most interesting buildings in the area, an old
Anglican church with its tombstone-studded graveyard.
Forty kilometers (25 miles) north of Governor’s Harbour is the village
Hatchet Bay. Hatchet Bay was once known for a sprawling British-owned
plantation that had 500 dairy cattle and thousands of chickens. Today,
the plantation is gone, and the village is now one of the sleepiest on
Eleuthera, as you can see if you veer off Queen’s Highway onto one of
the town’s ghostly main streets, Lazy Shore Road or Ocean Drive.
Gregory Town, north of Hatchet Bay, stands in the center of Eleuthera
against a backdrop of hills, which break the usual flat monotony of the
landscape. This village of clapboard cottages was once famed for grow-
ing pineapples. Although the industry isn’t as strong as it used to be, the
locals make a good pineapple rum out of the fruit, and you can visit the
Gregory Town Plantation and Distillery where they produce it. You can
sample it, and we almost guarantee that you’ll want to take a bottle
home with you!
Dedicated surfers come here from as far away as California and Australia
to test their skills at Surfer’s Beach, 3km (2 miles) south of Gregory
Town on the Atlantic side. The waves are at their highest in winter and
spring; even if you’re not brave enough to venture out, the surfers are
fun to watch.
South of Gregory Town on the way to Hatchet Bay are several caverns
worth visiting, the largest of which is called simply The Cave. It has a 
big fig tree out front, which the people of Gregory Town claim that area
pirates planted to conceal the cave because they had hidden treasure in
it. Local guides (you have to ask around in Gregory Town or Hatchet Bay)
can take you into the interior of the cave, where the resident bats are
harmless (even though they must resent the intrusion of tourists with
flashlights). At one point, the drop is so steep — about 3.6m (12 ft.) —
that you have to use a ladder to climb down. Eventually, you reach a
cavern studded with stalactites and stalagmites. At this point, a maze of
passageways leads through the rocky underground recesses. The cave
comes to an abrupt end at the edge of a cliff, where the thundering sea is
some 27m (90 ft.) below.
After leaving Gregory Town and driving north, you come to the famed
Glass Window, Eleuthera’s chief sight and narrowest point. A natural
rock arch once bridged the land, but it’s gone now, replaced by an artifi-
cially constructed bridge. As you drive across it, you can see the con-
trast between the deep blue ocean and the emerald green shoal waters
Part VI: The Out Islands 
310

of Exuma Sound. The rocks rise to a height of 21m (70 ft.). Often, as
ships in the Atlantic toss about, the crew looks across the narrow point
to see a ship resting quietly on the other side (hence, the name “Glass
Window”). American artist Winslow Homer was so captivated by this
spot that he once captured it on canvas.
The inhabitants of Current, a settlement in North Eleuthera, are believed
to have descended from a tribe of Native Americans. A narrow strait sepa-
rates the village from Current Island, where most of the locals make their
living from the sea or from plaiting straw goods. This small community
often welcomes visitors. It has no crowds and no artificial attractions.
Everything focuses on the sea, a source of pleasure for visitors, but a way
to sustain life for the local people.
From Current, you can explore some interesting sights in North Eleuthera,
including Preacher’s Cave, where the Eleutherian Adventurers found shel-
ter in the mid–17th century when they were shipwrecked with no provi-
sions. (Note that your taxi driver may balk at being asked to drive there;
the road is hard on his expensive tires.) If you do reach it, you’ll find a
cave that seems like an amphitheater. The very devout Eleutherian
Adventurers held religious services inside the cave, which has holes 
in the roof to allow light to intrude. The cave isn’t far from the North
Eleuthera Airport.
Living It Up After Dark
Eleuthera is rather sleepy, but it does have a hot spot or two. The place
to be in Gregory Town, especially on a Saturday night, is Elvina (% 242-
335-5032), on Main Street. Owners Ed and Elvina Watkins make you feel
right at home and practically greet you at the door with a cold beer.
Their place has a funky charm, with local artwork, license plates, and
surfboards as decorations. Surfers and locals alike flock here to chow
down on burgers, Bahamian dishes, and Cajun grub, served daily from
10 a.m. to “whenever we close.” Elvina’s husband, “Chicken Ed,” is from
Louisiana, and does he ever know how to make a great jambalaya!
Also at Governor’s Harbour, Ronnie’s Smoke Shop & Sports Bar (% 242-
332-2307), on Cupid’s Cay, is the most happening nightspot in central
Eleuthera. It’s adjacent to the cargo depot of Cupid’s Cay, in a connected
cluster of simple buildings painted in combinations of black with vivid
Junkanoo colors. Most folks come here just to drink Kalik beer and talk
at either of the two bars. But if you want to dance, it has an all-black
room just for disco music on Friday and Saturday nights. You also find
the only walk-in cigar humidor on Eleuthera. If you get hungry, order up
a plate of barbecue, pizza, chicken wings, or popcorn. The place is open
daily from 9 a.m. ’til at least 2 a.m.
Chapter 23: Eleuthera 311

Going Beyond Eleuthera
Of course, the most enticing day trip is to Harbour Island (see 
Chapter 22). But Spanish Wells is intriguing, too, as a journey back to a
distant past. Called a “quiet corner of The Bahamas,” Spanish Wells is a
colorful cluster of houses on St. George’s Cay, less than a kilometer (a
half-mile) off the coast of northwest Eleuthera. It’s characterized by its
sparkling bays and white beaches, sleepy lagoons, excellent diving, and
fine fishing colony.
You can walk through the village and look at the houses — some 
more than 200 years old — which have New England saltbox styling but
bright tropical coloring. You can see handmade quilts in many colors,
following patterns handed down from generations of English ancestors.
Homeowners display quilts for sale on their front porches or out their
windows.
Regardless of the time of day you arrive, a ferryboat is either waiting for
passengers or about to arrive with a load of them. (See “Getting Around
Eleuthera” earlier in this chapter for more details.)
If you’re on Spanish Wells at lunch, head for Jack’s Outback (% 242-
333-4219) along the harbor front. Unpretentious and well scrubbed, this
little place stands along the waterfront in the heart of town. Known for
its home-cooking, it offers the usual array of sandwiches and cheese-
burgers, as well as Bahamian foods like cracked conch, conch burgers,
and conch chowder. It also offers steaks, barbecued ribs, and cheesy
shrimp poppers. The interior is air-conditioned, with views of the sea.
Sandwiches cost from $4.80 to $12, with main courses priced from $11 to
$25. It’s open daily from 9 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. Credit cards aren’t accepted.

xuma — or the Exumas — is a string of some 365 cays, one for each
day of the year. Most cays are either barely populated or completely
uninhabited. The little archipelago is prime sailing, kayaking, fishing,
scuba diving, and snorkeling territory.
Arriving at the Airport
Fourteen kilometers (9 miles) from George Town, Exuma International
Airport is the official port of entry for this archipelago. Flights come in
from Nassau and Florida (Miami, Ft. Lauderdale, St. Petersburg, and
Sarasota). At the small, well-kept airport, you have to clear Customs
unless you’re coming from Nassau. Taxis wait just outside, and the cab
fare to George Town hotels is about $25 for two passengers.
If you’re going on to Stocking Island, an islet in Elizabeth Harbour, you
can make prior arrangements with your hotel for boat transfers.
Choosing Your Location
George Town, on Great Exuma, the main island, is the easiest to reach. At
the edge of Elizabeth Harbour, this postcard-pretty village isn’t known for
its beaches. However, just across the harbor from town, Stocking Island
boasts some of the country’s best sandy shores. A ferry links “mainland”
hotels to this beach-rimmed island. If you want to stay on Stocking Island,
your choice of hotels is limited to one: Hotel Higgins Landing. Although a
few George Town hotels have their own beaches, the swimming is far
better on Stocking Island. For guests of Higgins Landing, ferry service is
free between this sandy harbor islet and George Town.
Sailing is excellent from any home base. Rent a boat, and you can anchor

are top rate. No matter which hotel you select, you can arrange scuba
diving and fishing.
When you’re ready to explore dry land, George Town is the starting point
for renting a car or taking a taxi tour. A bridge links Great Exuma to Little
Exuma, which you can skip without suffering cultural deprivation. It’s like
wandering back into another day, because its heyday has been long gone
with the wind.
Accommodations in Exuma are as distinct as they are small. If you like
being in the middle of island action, book a room at Club Peace & Plenty
in town. Guests who prefer a secluded, elegant eco-resort can choose
solar-powered Hotel Higgins Landing on Stocking Island. (To find out
more about both these hotels, see the section “Staying in Style” later in
this chapter.)
No one has ever heard of the rat race in sleepy Exuma. Hotel rooms may
not have phones, and the few TVs may get only a couple of centrally
controlled channels (meaning that you watch whatever the bartender
turns to). The liveliest entertainment “jumps up” on weekends, usually
at Club Peace & Plenty, where the Saturday and sometimes Wednesday
night dance parties are legendary. Hotels are close enough to each other
that you can dine among them and mingle in a variety of settings. Some
good local restaurants besides the ones in the hotels are also conve-
niently located in and around George Town.
Getting Around Exuma
Exuma is very accessible, and you don’t have to rent a car.
 Hoofing it: George Town is designed for strolling, but don’t expect
sights that scream tourist attraction. This spot is a handsome little
waterfront village where browsing at the tree-shaded straw market,
sampling fresh conch salad at the dock, and mingling with residents
and fellow vacationers over drinks and home-style meals are the big
draws. The most idyllic walk is around Lake Victoria.
Shuttle service is provided to town from Peace & Plenty Beach
Inn, or you may want to walk the scenic mile.
If you don’t succumb to taking wheels, you can leisurely enjoy the
glimpses of the turquoise and neon blue water through the wispy
casuarina pines and bushy coconut palms lining Queen’s Highway.
“Highway” is a serious overstatement, so walking here is fine
because traffic is sparse.
 Taking a taxi: You’ll have no problems finding a taxi to take you to
and from the airport, far-flung restaurants, or on-land tours around
Great and Little Exuma. Your hotel can assist you. Fares are regu-
lated, but drivers don’t use meters, so agree on a price before set-
ting out. Taxi driver Kermit Rolle (% 242-345-0002), who also
Part VI: The Out Islands 
316

farms and runs local restaurants, seems to know everything anyone
could ever want to know about Exuma.
 Boarding a boat: For ferries between George Town and the beaches
on Stocking Island, call Club Peace & Plenty at % 242-336-2551.
The twice-daily ferries are complimentary for Club Peace & Plenty
guests. If you’re not staying at the hotel, the cost is $10 round-trip
and free for children under age 10. For renting boats, see “Climbing
Aboard” later in the chapter.
 Driving around: Vacationers based in and around George Town
have no real need to rent a car. If you want to see the rest of Great
Exuma and Little Exuma, you can hire a taxi. But if you prefer strik-
ing out on your own, try Thompson’s Car Rental in George Town
(% 242-336-2442 or 242-345-4189), where autos begin at about $65
per day. Or try Don’s Car Rental (% 242-345-0112), conveniently
located right at the airport; daily rates start at $75.
The George Town area has two gas stations: one near Exuma
International Airport and the other in Farmers Hill. They’re gener-
ally open Monday through Saturday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday
from 8 a.m. until noon, and on holidays from 8 to 10 a.m.
Staying in Style
Most hotels lie in and around George Town. Of the handful of hotels,
most have fewer than 16 rooms. For escapists, one of Exuma’s best
accommodations is an offshore “one-to-one”: one island, one resort.
Club Peace & Plenty
$$$
In the heart of George Town
This pink-and-white harborside hotel is the virtual social center of the
Exumas. Club Peace & Plenty was once a private home built on the site of
a slave market during Loyalist days when British supporters fled to The
Bahamas after the Revolutionary War. A former kitchen has been trans-
formed into a tavern decorated with old anchors, rudders, lanterns, and
other maritime artifacts. During the National Family Island Regatta each
April, visiting and local yachties flock to this hotel’s cozy lounge.
The handsome two-story building faces the main road on one side and
Elizabeth Harbour on the other. With balconies, satellite TV, and queen-
size, double, or twin beds, the 32 bright guest rooms overlook the harbor,
freshwater pool, or greenery. Although perfectly well maintained and com-
fortable, the rooms have a somewhat dated feel. Dine indoors or alfresco
at Club Peace & Plenty’s popular restaurant, where local seafood is the
specialty. Twice a week, the hotel features a poolside cocktail party for
guests. Snorkel gear is available, and a shuttle runs several times a day
between the hotel and its closest sibling, Peace & Plenty Beach Inn (see
the review later in the chapter). Guests can also take the complimentary
ferry just across the water to Stocking Island beaches.
Chapter 24: Exuma 317

Peace & Plenty is Exuma’s “chain” hotel. Peace & Plenty Beach Inn is about
a half-kilometer (1 mile) up the road. Six kilometers (10 miles) southeast
of George Town is Peace & Plenty Bonefish Lodge, an inn for anglers. The
lodge serves dinner several nights a week, and guests of Club Peace &
Plenty receive free transportation to it.

Coconut Cove Hotel
$$$
George Town
Set about 1.8km (1 mile) west of George Town — on a seafront plot of land
that’s dotted with groves of coconut palms and palmettos and host to a
brackish saltwater pond favored by bird life — this is a much-renovated
incarnation of a hotel that has stood here for 20 years. Designed with three
wings that radiate from a central core, much like the shape of an airplane
propeller, it offers 11 simple but well-cared-for rooms, a bar where the rum-
based Coconut Cove Specials are appropriately pink and heady, and a
restaurant (see listing below in the “Dining Out” section) whose cuisine is
praised as among the best on the island. The staff here can arrange access
to island tours and watersports options.

Four Seasons Resort Great Exuma at Emerald Bay
$$$$$
North of George Town
The quiet Exumas emerged from a sleep of centuries with the official open-
ing of this resort in the winter of 2004. Its sweeping ocean vistas and trop-
ical beauty frame an experience unique in this part of the world; the Out
Islands have seen nothing like this in their history, and the resort is
expected to change the entire character of the archipelago.
All 183 accommodations here open onto private terraces and balconies
with scenic views of the bay. You’re given a choice of rooms, from gener-
ously proportioned gardenview units to oceanview rooms opening directly
onto the bay. For the big spender, the resort also offers a series of execu-
tive suites and beachfront properties of one and two bedrooms.
So much goes on at this resort that you may never get around to explor-
ing the surrounding islands. The most spectacular feature is a champi-
onship 18-hole golf course designed by Greg Norman. The full-service spa
and health club is the finest in The Bahamas, and you can swim at the
hotel’s crescent-shaped white-sand beach or in its two pools. The best
marina in the southern Bahamas is on-site. And the cuisine is among the
best in the Out Islands, with both indoor and outdoor dining options and
a selection of Italian, Caribbean, Bahamian, and international dishes.

Hotel Higgins Landing
$$$$$
Stocking Island
This intimate resort is on a tiny, virtually uninhabited, beach-rimmed
island. Not only is it the only hotel on luscious Stocking Island, just a half-
kilometer (1 mile) across Elizabeth Harbour from George Town, but it’s
also accessible only by ferry. No roads or cars are on the island, so feet
and boats are the modes of transportation.
This upscale resort is solar powered. Hilly twists and turns along rocky
paths lead to the five cottages, which sport large decks. Strategically
placed to ensure both privacy and proximity to the beach, each unit is
beautifully furnished with antiques, four-poster queen-size beds, and
Oriental rugs. You’re asked to conserve water, but you don’t need to worry
about running out. Ceiling fans cool the air, which circulates through glass-
free screen windows. Cottages are equipped with enough voltage for fans
and reading lights, but you have to go elsewhere at the resort to use stan-
dard 110-volt electricity. Instead of television, you can visit the hotel’s little
library. Bob Higgins, who runs the hotel with his wife, Carol, is in charge
of breakfast, which the staff serves on a deck overlooking Silver Palms
Beach. One day, Bob may whip up coconut pancakes; the next, eggs
Benedict. The candlelit, multicourse dinner may be black mushroom soup
followed by grilled beef or seafood and espresso chocolate custard. Room
rates may seem high, but they include a gourmet dinner and hors 
d’oeuvres daily, the boat trip to and from the island upon arrival and
departure, and a variety of watersports equipment. You can make arrange-
ments for scuba diving, snorkeling, and fishing trips.
Chapter 24: Exuma 319
Houseboats
The most offbeat way to stay in the Exumas is on a brightly decorated floating house-
boat. Each boat is like a hotel suite that you can use to explore Elizabeth Harbour and
the coast of the Exumas. In between moving your houseboat from anchorage to
anchorage, you can go fishing, snorkeling, scuba diving, or just beachcombing. Each
houseboat sleeps six to eight people and is fully equipped with air-conditioning, hot
and cold running water, a marine radio, an inflatable dinghy, a fully equipped galley, all
linens, purified water, and a propane barbecue grill. Boats range from an 11m (35-ft.)
one-bedroom to a 13m (43-ft.) two-bedroom. You don’t need a special license or even
much experience to operate one of these boats. For reservations, contact Bahamas
Houseboats, P.O. Box EX29031, Government Dock, George Town, Exuma, The Bahamas
(% 242-336-BOAT; fax 242-336-2629; www.bahamahouseboats.com). Rentals
range from $360 to $490 per day, with a three-day minimum. American Express,
MasterCard, and Visa are accepted.

Smoking is not allowed inside the buildings, but it is permitted on your
deck or at the beach bar. Children under 18 are not allowed unless you
rent the entire resort.

Palm Beach Club
$$$
George Town
This is one of the most tranquil accommodations in the archipelago.
Overlooking the waters of Elizabeth Harbour, this attractive 32-room resort
offers beach-fronting villas, each featuring one of three options: a studio,
a one-bedroom unit, or a more luxurious and spacious two-bedroom
accommodations. The cottages are beautifully appointed, mostly with
kitchenettes, cable TV, and Internet available. Each villa is individually dec-
orated featuring queen-size or king-size beds, ceramic tile flooring, and
comfortable tropical-style furniture. A shuttle bus carries visitors to and
from George Town. Kayaks and paddle boats are available.

Peace & Plenty Beach Inn
$$$
Northwest of George Town
More subdued than its older sibling Club Peace & Plenty (see the review
earlier in this “Staying in Style” section), this 16-room B&B sits on a small
beach. Built in the early 1990s, it draws many snorkelers and bonefisher-
men. Everyone from newlyweds to families feel comfortable here. In the
spacious, attractively decorated guest rooms, French doors open onto
large patios or balconies overlooking the swimming pool and ocean. Steps
from the saltwater pool lead down to the sand, with expansive views of
Stocking Island across the water; guests can take the complimentary ferry
to the beautiful beaches. Regular shuttles link Peace & Plenty Beach Inn
with Club Peace & Plenty, the center of the George Town social scene.

Dining Out
Most of Exuma’s restaurants are in George Town, but you can take a
rental car, taxi, or hotel shuttle to some offbeat places in outlying areas.
Visit hotel dining rooms for the most sophisticated and priciest dining.
When these upscale accommodations serve local dishes, they often
have Continental and American influences.
Part VI: The Out Islands 
320

For the most authentic — and the least expensive — Bahamian cooking,
try a local restaurant. The food stall near George Town’s Government
Dock makes a great fresh conch salad prepared to order, but its hours
are limited: It’s open only on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
Most hotels fix reasonably priced picnic lunches for beach excursions
and other ramblings. Dining rooms in and outside hotels close between
meals, and the smaller spots don’t accept credit cards. Peace & Plenty
Beach Inn (see the review under “Staying in Style” earlier in this chap-
ter) provides shuttle service into town.

BAHAMIAN/CONTINENTAL/AMERICAN
Go here for the finest island dining, with plentiful and good home-cooked
meals that leave most guests satisfied. Boiled fish and grits is a popular
breakfast choice at this hotel dining room with harbor views. But, you can
also order eggs, French toast, and other American favorites. For lunch, try
the conch burgers. Appetizers include a savory conch chowder, pumpkin
soup, or hearts of palm salad. Grouper — pan-fried or steamed with pep-
pers and onions — makes frequent evening appearances, along with
Bahamian lobster and T-bone steak. You can also order pasta with shrimp
or a spicy tomato sauce.

Set on the premises of the previously recommended hotel, this dining
room sits close to the sea, within a glassed-in, blue, white, and coral-
colored dining room whose mahogany-and-glass doors slide open for max-
imum exposure to the breeze. American-born Palema Chimento, in coop-
eration with her Bahama-born assistant, Shelia, churns out well-flavored
versions of Italian and Mediterranean-inspired food that’s far removed
from the usual Bahamian fare you may have expected. Starters include
breaded calamari with oregano and parsley sauce, linguini marinara,
jalapeño peppers, breaded mozzarella sticks, onion soup, and seafood
salads. Main courses feature stone crabs, different preparations of shrimp,
crawfish, poached salmon served with a tropical fruit salsa, and “cowboy
steaks.” There’s also a choice of pizzas from a “pizza bar” on-site. Most
dishes, except for lobster, are priced at the low end of the scale.

Fisherman’s Inn

Barraterre
BAHAMIAN
This is the most isolated restaurant in the Exumas, a ramshackle, wood-
sided hideaway that’s set on a low ridge above the sea on the island of
Barraterre, a 40- to 60-minute drive from George Town. Connected with
two separate causeways to the “mainland” of Great Exuma Island, it’s lit-
erally at the end of the line for motorists looking for a lonely, sun-bleached,
and windblasted excursion from George Town. Don’t come here with the
assurance that there will be anything in the larder at the time of your
arrival. If the season is slow, or if the supplies “didn’t make it in that week,”
you may be faced with a smile and perhaps a somewhat erratic dialogue
from the owner, and ’nary a crust of bread. To avoid disappointment, call
ahead to survey the gastronomic lay of the land by discussing with the
staff what may, or may not, be available that day. Expect a roster of fish,
chicken, beefsteaks, soups, salads, and stews, lots of local color, and a gen-
uine sense of the degree to which parts of The Bahamas archipelago are
isolated from the rest of the world.
See map p. 315. Barraterre. % 242-355-5016. Reservations required. Main courses:
lunch $8–$10, dinner $20–$25. No credit cards. Daily 7 a.m.–midnight.

On Monday nights, this is the place to be for the weekly “rake ’n scrape,”
when a band transforms rakes, saws, washboards, and other household
items into instruments and turns the restaurant into a party — a wonder-
ful, traditional Bahamian moment. At the edge of Lake Victoria, this casual
hangout gets raves for its turtle steak and steamed chicken. If you have
your heart set on either of those dishes, call ahead to make sure that
they’re on the menu that day. Other well-prepared dishes for lunch and
dinner include okra soup, conch chowder, and pan-fried grouper. Breakfast
is standard but reliable, with pancakes, French toast, and omelets, along
with grits, ham, and bacon.

Islanders tell you that this restaurant is the place for that local favorite,

Eating with the locals
You can grab a quick meal at several casual joints in George Town. Towne Café, in the
Marshall Complex (% 242-336-2194) serves one of the best breakfasts in George Town.
It’s really the town bakery. Drop in any day but Sunday for a lunch of local Exumian
specialties such as stewed grouper or chicken souse, or just a sandwich.
A former school bus was recycled and turned into Jean’s Dog House along Queen’s
Highway in George Town. Here you’ll find the island’s best lobster burger in a cramped
but spotless kitchen on wheels. Instead of eating our hotel dining room, we like to go
here for breakfast and order the “MacJean,” a robust sandwich with sausage or
bacon, plus cheese, on freshly baked bread. Of course, she’s also noted for her “dogs,”
or frankfurters. The owner is a well-loved personality known only as Jean. Visit her
between 7 a.m. and 3 p.m. and don’t bother bringing your credit card.
The best conch salad is found at Big D’s Conch Spot No. 2, Government Dock (% 242-
358-0059). “Fresh, sexy conch,” as it’s called here, is served daily. They’ll make it right
in front of you, so you know exactly what’s going into your salad. They’re open Tuesday
to Sunday noon to midnight. Reservations required only for large parties.

A popular meeting place, this hotel dining spot within view of the marina

now you know all about it, too.

Enjoying the Sand and Surf
Most of the excitement on Exuma is all wet. However, you can spend a
day driving to and through some of the drowsy settlements scattered
along Great Exuma and the adjoining Little Exuma. If you don’t, you end
up missing some sights, such as historic gravesites, pink salt ponds,
brightly painted tiny houses, a little museum-boutique, small farms, ves-
tiges of plantation ruins, and plenty of island greenery.
Walking around George Town gives you plenty of opportunities to meet
and greet residents and other vacationers. Instead of spending a whole
day touring the island on dry land, you may have more fun seeing the
sights by water — in a sailboat, speedboat, or kayak. This way, you can
explore some of the smaller offshore uninhabited cays.
The George Town–based Starfish Activity Center (% 242-336-3033)
makes booking everything from kayaking to snorkeling as simple as one
phone call.
Combing the beaches
George Town’s best beaches aren’t in George Town but are across
Elizabeth Harbour on a pencil-thin slip of land known as Stocking Island.
Not even 8km (5 miles) long and barely a kilometer (a half-mile) wide,
Stocking Island protects the harbor from the open ocean. Club Peace &
Plenty provides ferry service to this beach-rimmed island (free for
guests of Club Peace & Plenty, $8 for non-guests, and free for children
under age 10).
You can traverse Stocking Island only by foot or boat. For the calmest
swimming, your best bet is the soft, white sands on the harbor side of
the island. If you prefer rougher surf, take the path across the island to
the Atlantic coast; shelling is also ideal on the Atlantic side of the island.
If you didn’t pack a picnic lunch, just visit the snack bar. Scuba divers
and snorkelers are lured to Stocking Island by the blue holes (ocean
pools of fresh water floating on heavier salt water), coral gardens, and
Part VI: The Out Islands 
324

undersea caves. Mystery Cave, for example, meanders for some 121m
(400 ft.) beneath this virtually uninhabited island.
Playing in the surf
Exuma’s best asset is, of course, its surrounding sea. Here’s a guide to
the best watersports so you can get started on your ocean adventures.
Kayaking
You can best appreciate some of Exuma’s most dramatic scenery from
the peaceful perch of a sea kayak. In fact, many areas — including man-
grove lakes, rivers, manta ray gathering spots, and bonefish flats — are
too shallow for other boats to enter. Don’t worry if you haven’t hit the
gym lately. Anyone in at least average physical condition — from chil-
dren to seniors — can kayak with a smile. The Starfish Activity Center,
based out of George Town (% 242-336-3033), rents sit-on-top kayaks for
singles and doubles. Singles cost about $10 an hour, $30 per half-day, $45
a day, or $160 a week. Doubles cost $15 an hour, $45 per half-day, $55 a
day, or $180 a week.
For more adventure, book one of Starfish’s guided kayak trips, which the
company offers daily. You don’t have to spend the whole time paddling
your kayak. During half- and full-day excursions, you get lunch and bev-
erages, and the price covers all gear, including snorkeling equipment.
You may find yourself watching a blizzard of fish swarm a shipwreck,
searching for sand dollars on a deserted beach, snorkeling into a sea
Chapter 24: Exuma 325
A regatta to remember
George Town may be known as a quiet, restful place, but in April the National Family
Island Regatta changes all that. If you visit at this time of year, book your hotel room
many, many months in advance. Although the regatta brings many a far-flung
Bahamian back home for this week-long event, the maritime competition seems almost
incidental to the festivities occurring on terra firma.
As the handcrafted sloops, owned and sailed by Bahamians, compete in Elizabeth
Harbour, vendors along the waterfront sell grilled chicken, fried fish, and conch in all
its varieties. Reggae fills the air. Men huddle around card tables, slapping dominos
down with dramatic arcs of their arms. A Junkanoo parade — complete with loud
drums and whistles, cowbells, and horns — pulses down the street. Spectators sit on
the walls near the Government Building as cars with blaring horns festooned with rain-
bow-hued streamers pass in a slow line.
When the police band takes center stage in Regatta Park, people surge onto nearby
steps for the best views. Band members look distinguished in their white tunics, wide
red belts, red-banded hats, and black trousers with red side stripes. But nothing is
formal about the way their lively music stirs up the crowd. Feet tap, fingers snap, and
hips swing, whether they belong to tiny tots or elderly grandmothers.

cave, or finding out about bush medicine while you hike along a nature
trail. Guided trips begin at $35 an hour for adults and $25 an hour for
children.
Another good outfitter is Ecosummer Expeditions (% 800-465-8884).
Ecosummer is especially skilled in exploring Exuma Cays Land and Sea
Park (% 242-357-8344), a government-protected natural preserve with
excellent wildlife viewing opportunities.
Scuba diving
Surrounding the Exumas, fields of massive coral heads, eerie blue holes,
and exciting walls covered with marine life are exposed to scuba divers.
Many excellent reefs are just 20 or 25 minutes away from the George
Town area, so long boat rides don’t cut into your underwater time.
For scuba divers, the great attraction here is the Exuma Cays Land and
Sea Park, which is 35km (22 miles) long and 13km (8 miles) wide. It draws
scuba divers to its 453 sq. km (175 sq. miles) of sea gardens with magnifi-
cent coral reefs, flora, and fauna. The park, inaugurated in 1958, lies some
35km (22 miles) northeast of Staniel Cay. Call your hotel to ask whether it
offers a hotel/dive package or try Exuma Scuba Adventures (% 242-336-
2893) at Peace & Plenty Beach Inn for information about scuba-diving
excursions. A one-tank morning boat dive goes for $55, and a two-tank
dive costs $75. You can also take an afternoon one-tank boat dive for $55
or a one-tank night dive for $60. A reef boat trip for snorkeling costs $25.
Snorkeling
The best bet for snorkeling is the magnificent waters off the coast of
Stocking Island, across Elizabeth Harbour from George Town, a distance
of 1.5km (1 mile). Stocking Island is a long, thin barrier island known for
its crystal clear waters, white sands, and blue holes. The island is also
ringed with a series of undersea caves and stunning coral gardens in
rainbow colors. You can take a boat trip from George Town to Stocking
Island; boats depart twice a day. Call Exuma Scuba Adventures (% 242-
336-2893) if you want to snorkel around some of Exuma’s most well-
preserved reefs. These three-hour-plus excursions cost $25 per adult
and $10 for children under 12.
Climbing aboard
If you like the water but want to keep your feet dry, George Town makes
a good home base for skimming the waves.
Through the Starfish Activity Center (% 242-336-3033), based in George
Town, you can rent Hobie Waves, high-performance sailboats that are easy
to use. These stable, lightweight-yet-durable, 4.5m (15-ft.) catamarans are
ideal for families, because they’re simple to maneuver. With a minimum of
two people, you can take a two-hour lesson for $30 per person. Renting
one of these babies runs you $35 for two hours, $60 for a half-day, $85 for
a full day, or — if it really looks good to you — $300 for a week.

If motor boats are more your speed, Minns Water Sports (% 242-336-
3483 or 242-336-2604), based out of George Town, rents these 5-, 5.4-,
and 6.7m (17-, 18-, and 22-ft.) boats for $85 to $195 per day, with daily
rates dropping the longer you rent. Exuma Dive Center in George Town
(% 800-874-7213 or 242-336-2390),where boat rentals start at $80 per
day, also offers more economical rates when you keep a boat for a week
or longer. With your boat, you can set out to sail the most stunning
waters in The Bahamas, rivaled only by those in the Abacos. The best
territory for recreational boating is the government-protected Exuma
Cays Land and Sea Park, which stretches south from Wax Cay to Conch
Cay, with their magnificent sea gardens and coral reefs.
Many visitors come to the Exumas just to go bonefishing, deep-sea, or
bottom fishing, pursuing the likes of wahoo, dolphinfish, tuna, bonito,
and kingfish, among other species. You can make arrangements for out-
ings through Club Peace & Plenty (% 242-345-5555), the central office
for the Peace & Plenty properties, located on Queen’s Highway. The
Exumas offer kilometers of wadeable flats (shallow bodies of water),
where trained guides can accompany you. The resort also offers fly-
fishing instruction and equipment.
Exploring on Dry Land
George Town is one of the prettiest settlements in the Out Islands. Spend
some time wandering around this small village that borders both a harbor
and a serene lake.
Touring George Town and Little Exuma
The Government Building, an impressive flamingo-colored edifice with
white columns, stands at the harbor’s edge. This location provides one-
stop shopping for the post office, the police station, the courts, the jail,
and the Ministry of Education.
Under the shady canopy of enormous trees out front of N&D’s Fruits
and Vegetables, women sit at their posts selling T-shirts, shell jewelry,
various straw goods, and snacks. You can also stop for an inexpensive
breakfast or some ice cream or other sweet treats.
Up the road a bit, St. Andrew’s Anglican Church sits on a bluff. For a
good view, go up the hill and around back to the gravesites. This resting
place overlooks sparkling Lake Victoria. You may see small boats making
their way toward the narrow opening that leads to the harbor. On your
trek up the road, you pass small square houses with chickens running in
front yards, a few mom-and-pop restaurants, and magnificent petite
churches.
During your walk, you’ll come to a table piled high with conch shells.
Here you can watch this fish vendor hammer a shell, deftly cut out the
dark mollusk and then skin it, exposing the white flesh that tastes so
Chapter 24: Exuma 327

delectable in so many Bahamian specialties, such as cracked conch or
conch chowder. Then spend some time sitting quietly on the pier at the
water’s edge.
Set aside part of a morning or afternoon for a taxi tour or a rental car
drive down to Little Exuma, connected to Great Exuma by a bridge.
Little Exuma is a faraway retreat, the southernmost of the Exuma Cays. It
has a subtropical climate, despite being in the tropics, and lovely white
sand beaches. The waters are so crystal clear in some places that you
can spot the colorful tropical fish more than 18m (60 ft.) down. Less
than 1.6km (1 mile) offshore is Pigeon Cay, an uninhabited island. You
can go snorkeling here and visit the remains of a 200-year-old wreck,
right offshore in about 2m (6 ft.) of water. Visitors often come to Pigeon
Cay for the day and later have a boat pick them up to take them back to
Little Exuma. On one of the highest hills of Little Exuma, you can explore
the remains of an old pirate fort. Several cannons are located nearby,
but no one knows who built the fort or when. (Pirates didn’t leave too
many records lying around.)
Coming from Great Exuma, the first community you reach on Little Exuma
is called Ferry, so named because the two islands used to be linked by a
ferry service before the bridge was built. If anyone’s around, see whether
you can visit the private chapel of an Irish family, the Fitzgeralds, erected
generations ago. Along the way, you can take in Pretty Molly Bay, site of
the now-shuttered Sand Dollar Beach Club. Pretty Molly was a slave who
committed suicide by walking into the water one night. Many locals have
reported seeing her reincarnated as a mermaid sitting on a rock combing
her hair.
Many visitors come to Little Exuma to visit the Hermitage, a plantation
constructed by Loyalist settlers — the last surviving example of the
many that once stood in the Exumas. The Kendall family, who came to
Little Exuma in 1784, originally built it. They established their plantation
at Williamstown, and, with their slaves, set about growing cotton. But
they encountered so many difficulties in shipping the cotton to Nassau
that in 1806 they advertised that the plantation was for sale. The ad
promised “970 acres more or less” along with “160 hands” (referring to
the slaves). Chances are a local guide will offer to show you around for a
fee. Also ask to see several old tombs in the area. At Williamstown (look
for the marker on the seaside), you can visit the remains of the Great
Salt Pond, a shallow estuary separated from the ocean by a narrow bar-
rier beach.
Keeping active
Four Seasons Resort Emerald Bay Golf Club (% 242-366-6800) is one of
the great oceanfront golf courses in the Caribbean. This Greg Norman–
designed course features six oceanfront holes. The par-72 course
stretches a challenging 6,284m (6,873 yards), yet accommodates golfers
of various skill levels. The course uses environmentally friendly seashore

precautions are advised. Keep your valu-
ables in a safe place and don’t go into
deserted, unfamiliar areas alone at night.

$145 for 18 holes ($145–$175 for non-guests), and the club requires reser-
vations. The resort also has six Har-Tru courts and a state-of-the art fit-
ness center.
Living It Up After Dark
The best place to head for some after-dark diversion is Club Peace &
Plenty (% 800-525-2210 or 242-336-2093), located in George Town.
Although summer nights are slow here, something is usually happening
here in winter, ranging from weekly poolside bashes to live bands that
keep both locals and visitors jumping up on the dance floor.

rowsy San Salvador is so undeveloped that it has just two hotels
and a handful of restaurants, most located at the larger hotel.
Fabulous scuba diving brings most visitors to these tranquil shores.
Beautiful empty beaches and easygoing, friendly residents also keep
vacationers coming back. If bar hopping, nightclubbing, and eating at a
different restaurant every night of the week is what you have in mind,
then San Salvador isn’t the island for you.
Arriving in San Salvador
San Salvador’s small airport is a cinch to access. If you’re staying at Club
Med, you’ll arrive on a direct charter flight from Miami or New York. Club
Med’s all-inclusive rates cover airfare. You can arrange charter flights
through the Riding Rock Inn Resort and Marina as well. Both hotels pro-
vide their guests with group transportation to and from the airport. If
you’re flying into New Providence, you can catch a flight to San Salvador
on BahamasAir (% 800-222-4262).
Choosing Your Location
Deciding where to stay on San Salvador is like choosing between pizza
and filet mignon — the two beach hotels, Club Med–Columbus Isle and
the Riding Rock Inn Resort and Marina — are both good, just different.
The Riding Rock resembles a pleasant motel, while the larger Club Med
resort is decked out in art and artifacts from around the globe.
The two beach hotels have one thing in common: They both offer excel-
lent scuba-diving programs that allow you to take advantage of the island’s
main attraction — its underwater wonders. Some 40 well-preserved 
dive sites are no more than 45 minutes away from both hotels by boat.

is a comfortable stroll or a quick bike or taxi ride away. However, calling
the capital a town is like calling a caterpillar a snake. Cockburn Town fea-
tures a restaurant, bar, and bank that’s open once a week, but the chance
to mingle with friendly residents is the real reason for heading to town.
Getting Around San Salvador
Renting a car isn’t necessary in San Salvador. If you want to tour the
island, ask your hotel staff to help you with arrangements.
 Taking a taxi: Your hotel staff can arrange taxi service for you. If you
have the staff at Club Med (% 242-331-2000) arrange an island tour
for you, the cost is around $25 per person for a half-day ramble.
 Driving around: On San Salvador, you don’t need to rent a car
unless you want to explore far-flung places on your own. You can

rent a car through Riding Rock Inn Resort and Marina (% 242-
331-2631) for about $85 a day.
 Pedaling bicycles: Club Med guests have use of bikes for cycling
around the property and for guided tours around the island. If
you’re not staying at Club Med, you can rent two-wheelers at Riding
Rock Inn Resort and Marina for about $10 a day.
Staying in Style
Club Med–Columbus Isle
$$$$$
North of Cockburn Town
Until something better opens, this resort is the poshest, and it’s far better
than your typical Club Med vacation village. Set on the edge of one of the
most pristine beaches in the archipelago, with 3km (2 miles) of white sand,
it employs some 30 percent of the island’s work force. This 280-room behe-
moth even operates on its own time clock: Clocks are set one hour earlier
than eastern standard time to give late-rising guests another hour of 
daylight.
Built around a large free-form pool, the resort offers public rooms that are
among the most lavish in the islands. Bedrooms contain a private balcony
or patio, custom-made furniture from Thailand or the Philippines, sliding
glass doors, and feathered wall hangings crafted in the Brazilian rain forest
by members of the Xingu tribe. Rooms are large (among the most spacious
in the entire hotel chain). Most rooms have twin beds, but you may be able
to snag one of the units with a double or a king-size bed if you’re lucky.
The resort offers nightly entertainment presented in a covered, open-air
theater and a dance floor behind one of the bars.

North of Cockburn Town
In stark contrast to the lavish Club Med, with its perky staff, Riding Rock Inn
offers a more tranquil atmosphere. The 42 rooms are motel-like, but they’re
pleasantly decorated and outfitted with all the modern conveniences you
need for a comfortable stay. The newer, two-story building houses are the
best digs, and each room features two double beds, a TV, a refrigerator, and
a balcony or patio with an ocean view. The hotel’s older, smaller rooms
overlook the pool. Most guests are avid divers who stay wet. (Riding Rock
offers excellent scuba packages.) During the day while divers are away, this

place seems downright empty. Nighttime is a different story, however. In
fact, you could call Riding Rock Inn Resort and Marina San Salvador’s social

and Friday nights aren’t so quiet, either.

Dining Out
If you’re staying at Club Med, room rates include all your meals. The
resort offers reliable food, with all ingredients imported. The cuisine
never reaches the sublime, but there is an effort to offer variety. Unlimited

However, you shouldn’t leave the island without sneaking off campus for
some local flavor.

Enjoying the Sand and Surf
If you’re looking for empty beaches or fantastic diving and snorkeling
opportunities, you’ve come to the right place.
Combing the beaches
If you prefer finding a stretch of sand where the only footprints on it are
your own, rent a car or a bike at Riding Rock Inn Resort and Marina or
call a taxi. (See “Getting Around San Salvador” earlier in this chapter.)
Empty beaches are everywhere. Just remember to take plenty of water
and, of course, sunblock. You won’t find much shade. Along the way, you
can look for the island’s various monuments to Christopher Columbus.
On the northeast coast, East Beach stretches for some 10km (6 miles).
Crushed coral and shells turned the shore a rosy pink. The deep turquoise
patches in the clear waters are coral heads, but the beach isn’t good for
snorkeling — people have spotted sharks here. Tall sea wheat or sea grass
sprouts up from the sand. Off mile-marker number 24 on the main road,
you can pick your way to the Chicago Herald Columbus Monument (see
the “Exploring on Dry Land” section later in this chapter.)
Playing in the surf
Scuba divers flock to this remote island, which is a major dive destina-
tion with some 40 dive sites that lie no more than 45 minutes by boat
from either of the two resorts. San Salvador has such stunning sea walls
around it that wall diving — diving where the sloping shoreline suddenly
drops off steeply and plummets to the ocean depths — is a popular
activity here.
Riding Rock Inn Resort and Marina (% 242-331-2631), just north of
Cockburn Town, specializes in scuba packages and offers a good under-
water photography program, as well as night dives on Tuesday evenings.
For one of the best outfitters, call Guanahani Dive Ltd. (% 242-331-
2631), based at Riding Rock Inn.
Club Med-Columbus Isle, also just north of Cockburn Town, should
really be called an almost-all-inclusive resort, because scuba diving isn’t
included in its rates. Resort courses run $120, and certification courses
are $400. A one-tank dive costs $40 and a two-tank dive costs $60.
Following in the footsteps of Columbus, snorkelers can find a rich para-
dise on this relatively undiscovered island, with its unpolluted and unpop-
ulated kilometers of beaches that are ideal for swimming, shelling, and, of
course, snorkeling. If you stay here a week, you’ve only begun to explore
the possibilities. Places such as Bamboo Point, Fernandez Bay, and Long
Bay all lie within a few miles of the main settlement of Cockburn Town on
the more tranquil western side of the island. At the southern tip of San
Salvador is one of our favorite places for snorkeling, Sandy Point, and its
Part VI: The Out Islands 
334

satellite of Grotto Bay. The elkhorn coral reefs off San Salvador are worth
the trip to Sandy Point and Grotto Bay.
Exploring on Dry Land
For such a small island, San Salvador offers a great deal of history as
well as some sights that merit a look.
Rent a bike, hire a taxi, or start walking, and see how many of the
Christopher Columbus monuments you can hit. All these monuments
are supposed to mark the place where Columbus and his crew anchored
the Niña, Pinta, and Santa Maria early that morning in 1492:
 Tappan Monument: Just south of Cockburn Town, this small, four-
sided stone pillar stands on the beach at Fernandez Bay (mile-
marker no. 5 on the main road). The Tappan gas company embedded
this monument here on February 25, 1951, in honor of Columbus.
 A tall cross: At mile-marker no. 6, about 5km (3 miles) south of
Cockburn Town, stands the tall cross at the edge of the water,
which is also a tribute to Columbus. This cross has been here since
1956, along with a third monument that lies hidden on the ocean
floor.
 The Chicago Herald Monument: This monument is located at mile-
marker no. 24 on the east coast. To reach it, turn off the main road
and drive a half-kilometer (1 mile) to East Beach. Unless you meet a
resident who can give you a ride in a four-wheel-drive car, you have
to get out and walk. Turn right and hike 3km (2 miles) parallel to the
beach until the sandy road ends. You’ll see a cave to the left, at the
water’s edge. Follow the path to the right. Cupped by vegetation, a
stone structure lies on the slice of land between the ocean and the
bay. Although many historians dispute the claim, the marble plaque
boasts, “On this spot Christopher Columbus first set foot upon the
soil of the New World, erected by the Chicago Herald, June 1891.”
(Two reporters from the newspaper marked the site to commemo-
rate the 400th anniversary of Columbus’s landfall.) The only prob-
lem with the monument’s claim is that the treacherous reefs here
make this a dangerous — and highly unlikely — landing spot.
Another monument, located next to the Columbus cross south of
Cockburn Town, commemorates the 1968 Olympic games in Mexico. 
A spiral walkway leads to the top of this structure, where the bowl of 
the dark metal sculpture held the Olympic flame that was brought from
Greece. The flame burned here until it was taken to the games in Mexico
City.
In the northeastern portion of the island, the Dixon Hill Lighthouse,
built in 1856, sends out an intense beam two times every 25 seconds.
This signal is visible for 31km (19 miles). The oil-using lighthouse rises
49m (160 ft.) into the sky, and the lighthouse keeper still operates it by

lighthouse keeper, who’s almost always in the neighboring house.
After huffing and puffing your way up, you’ll be surprised when you see
how tiny the source of light actually is. From the top of the lighthouse,
you can take in a panoramic view of San Salvador’s inland lakes, a dis-
tant Crab Cay, and the surrounding islets. Ask the lighthouse keeper to
show you the inspector’s log, with signatures that date back to Queen
Victoria’s reign. Be sure to leave at least a $1 donation when you sign the
guestbook on your way out. The lighthouse lies about a 30-minute taxi
ride from Riding Rock Inn Resort and Marina or Club Med.
Staying Active
Club Med–Columbus Isle offers ten tennis courts (three lit for night
play), and Riding Rock Inn Resort and Marina has one (often empty)
court. Fishermen test their skills against blue marlin, yellowfin tuna, and
wahoo on fishing trips, which you can arrange through Riding Rock Inn
Resort and Marina (% 242-331-2631), north of Cockburn Town. The
trips run $400 for a half-day and $600 for a full day. Bonefishermen enjoy
Pigeon Creek, and some record catches have been chalked up here.
Rent a boat from a local or get your hotel to help set you up.
Living It Up After Dark
Club Med (% 242-331-2000), just north of Cockburn Town, keeps its
guests entertained every night with musical revues and shows starring
vacationers themselves. At Riding Rock Inn Resort and Marina (% 242-

features reggae music, and many locals come to party. The hotel’s
Driftwood Bar is also hot on Friday nights (call % 242-331-2631 in The

Top Ten Myths about 
The Bahamas
In This Chapter
 Getting the geography straight
 Figuring out the weather
 Discovering that no two islands — or islanders — are alike
I
n this chapter, we explain some of the most common misconceptions
about these sunny islands. So the next time someone starts talking
about wanting to go mountain climbing in The Bahamas, you can set him
straight.
Columbus Definitely Landed at San Salvador
Historians aren’t certain whether Columbus’s three Spanish ships actu-
ally landed on San Salvador (which used to be called Watling’s Island
until the Bahamian legislature changed it in 1926). The Italian seafarer
left no marker to indicate his landfall. Some geographers claim that the
landfall occurred on one of the cays of Turks and Caicos; another site in
the running is Cat Island. Artifacts of European origin, dating anywhere
from 1490 to 1560, were found on San Salvador in 1983. But in a meticu-
lously researched article, National Geographic published evidence in
1986 that the landfall occurred at Samana Cay, some 104km (65 miles) to
the southeast of San Salvador.
The question will probably never be resolved. All we know is that at 
2 a.m. on the moonlit night of October 12, 1492, Columbus and his men
landed somewhere in the southern Bahamas and woke up some sleepy
Lucayans who called them “men from Heaven.” In time, when the
Spanish killed or sold the Native Americans into slavery, the seafarers
may have been more aptly called “men from Hell.”
The Bahamas Are One Island
The Bahamas aren’t one island — in fact, this archipelago is made up 
of more than 700 islands, from large landmasses to sandbars. People

inhabit only about 30 of the islands, and just a handful of islands actually
have hotels. 
The Bahamas Are in the Caribbean
Sure, it begins with a B, just like Barbados and Bonaire, but The
Bahamas (like Bermuda) are in the Atlantic Ocean, not the Caribbean
Sea. The Bahamas are close enough that the weather most often feels
like the West Indies. Scattered across some 258,998 sq. km (100,000 sq.
miles) of ocean, the islands of the once-British Bahamas have their own
special flavor. However, they share a West Indian heritage with their
Caribbean neighbors. Therefore, you do find some similarities in archi-
tecture, food, music, dance, and the accents of the people.
Beach Weather Is a Given
The weather is not always warm enough for the beach. The Bahamas do
cool off to often springlike temperatures around late December to March.
Those months are much better for playing golf and tennis than for swim-
ming and sunbathing. The weather can change quickly during this time of
year, moving in a flash from beach days to cool days, and then back again.
The Islands Are Mountainous
In the low-lying islands, mountains are more like molehills. The highest
point in all The Bahamas — on sleepy Cat Island — is just 63m (206 ft.).
Unlike the often-majestic volcanic islands of the Caribbean, these
Atlantic isles were created by coral reefs, which make for phenomenal
scuba diving and snorkeling, starting in unusually shallow waters.
Palm Trees Are All Over the Place
Except around resorts and residential developments, where people
planted palms, most of the trees you see are long-needled casuarina pines.
Palms line some beaches, but wispy-looking evergreens (which lean in the
direction of the prevailing wind) border the majority of beaches.
For Casinos and Hot Nightlife, 
Pick Any Island
If you want to gamble into the wee hours or dance ’til the sun comes 
up, you need to choose the island(s) you visit carefully. Head to Nassau,
Cable Beach, or Paradise Island (all on or attached to the island of New
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
342

Providence), or to Freeport or Lucaya (on Grand Bahama Island). The
rest of the islands don’t have casinos, and what little nightlife they do
have is liveliest on weekends.
All Bahamians Are of African Descent
On some islands, you find lots of locals with blue eyes and white skin. For
example, almost everyone is of European ancestry on Spanish Wells, off
the island of Eleuthera, as well as on Man-O-War Cay and Guana Cay, both
in the Abacos. Most of these residents are direct descendants of some of
The Bahamas’ earliest settlers: the Eleutherian Adventurers. Arriving in
Spanish Wells in the mid-1600s, these settlers came from Britain in search
of religious freedom. In the late 1700s, after the Revolutionary War ended
in America, Loyalists (Euro-Americans who sided with the British Crown)
also fled to both Eleuthera and the Abacos.
Islanders Resent Tourists
Bahamians are some of the most personable folks around — that is, as
long as visitors treat them with respect. For example, if you need to ask
someone for directions, say “Hello” first, and don’t assume that every
local you see works at the resort, store, or restaurant that you’re visit-
ing. Strike up a conversation with a resident, and you’re sure to come
away with a tip about a popular nightspot or a little-known beach. You
may even end up with a new friend.
Reggae Music Is the Local Sound
Although you certainly hear reggae music in The Bahamas, it was born
in Jamaica, not in these islands. You also hear plenty of calypso (origi-
nally from Trinidad), plus lots of American pop, R&B, and rock. But
along with all those imports, The Bahamas have their own sound.
Traditionally played with cowbells, goatskin drums, whistles, and trum-
pets, fast-paced Junkanoo music is at the heart of the colorful carnival-
like festival held on Boxing Day (Dec 26) and New Year’s Day.
You may also hear the sounds of Goombay (a pared-down version of
Junkanoo that’s generally played without the elaborate festival cos-
tumes). Particularly in the Out Islands, some nightspots still have old-
fashioned rake and scrapes, where bands turn things like washboards,
saws, and barrels into instruments.
Chapter 26: Top Ten Myths about The Bahamas 343

Chapter 27
Top Ten Bahamas Moments
In This Chapter
 Walking on the ocean floor without scuba gear
 Seeing the sights from a horse-drawn carriage
 Diving with dolphins and snorkeling with stingrays
A
re you in the mood for a romantic stroll through manicured English-
style gardens? Or is a ride in a horse-drawn carriage along the 
history-packed streets of Nassau more up your alley? Ever wondered
whether pink sand is as soft as the snow-white variety?
Along with scuba diving and snorkeling — which are phenomenal all
over The Bahamas — here are other unforgettable adventures you can
consider putting at the top of your “to do” list.
Walking on the (Wet and) Wild Side
You can walk on the ocean floor without wearing scuba gear. You don’t
have to take lengthy classes, either — you just do it. While you’re getting
up close and personal with fish and coral, your face and hair stay dry.
This fun activity is called helmet diving. To partake in this adventure,
join one of Hartley’s Undersea Walks in Nassau. To do so, you wear a
lead and glass helmet as you descend a ladder into the ocean. A tank on
the boat pumps air through a long tube into your aquatic helmet. For
more information, see Chapter 13.
Taking a Carriage Ride through Nassau
Because Nassau, located on New Providence Island, is so full of the
country’s history, a good way to see this harborside city is from an old-
fashioned horse-drawn carriage. You can take a leisurely ride along busy
Bay Street (the main thoroughfare) past Parliament Square, with its 18th-
and 19th-century Georgian-style government buildings (painted pink and
white) and a statue of a young Queen Victoria, among other sights. Turn
to Chapter 10 for details.

Wandering through Versailles Gardens
On Paradise Island, you can enjoy a setting that you’d expect to find only
in the countryside of France. Studded with bright flowers, shady trees, a
lily pond with turtles, and bronze and marble statues, Versailles Gardens
(see Chapter 13 for details) is the site of a 12th-century monastery.
Dramatically perched on a rise, it was built by the Augustinian monks in
France. In 1962, Huntington Hartford, the island’s original developer, had
it moved to the island and reassembled, stone by stone.
Making a Date with Dolphins
Dolphin skin feels like warm, buttery leather. Pet one and you’ll see what
we mean. (Some marine studies, however, suggest that dolphins don’t
like human contact. They’re such friendly animals, though, you don’t get
that impression.) You can commune with dolphins on Grand Bahama or
an island off New Providence. Some sessions allow you to wade in the
water with these mammals while trainers tell you everything you ever
wanted to know about them. In other programs, you can scuba dive with
Flipper’s cousins in the open ocean. For more details, see Chapter 13 (on
New Providence) and Chapter 17 (on Grand Bahama).
Feeding the Stingrays
If you find dolphins too tame, try feeding the stingrays that swim grace-
fully through the shallow waters around a tiny island off Green Turtle
Cay in the Abacos (see Chapter 20). If you don’t know how to snorkel,
your guide can teach you on the spot, or you can take to the water
dressed in scuba gear. Either way, you’re also treated to a beach picnic
after your captain grills the fish or lobster that he just caught.
Digging Your Toes into a Pink Sand Beach
Harbour Island’s Pink Sand Beach may be only 2km (3 miles) long, but it
seems to go on forever. The unusual color comes from shells and coral
that the waves have pulverized over the years. This beach is pretty
enough to make you roll out of bed in time to catch the sunrise. (Turn 
to Chapter 22 for more details.)
Watching the Sun Set on Dunmore Town
For some of the best sunsets in The Bahamas, head to Harbour Island’s
western coast. The spectacle is special here because of the glow that the
sun casts on the 18th-century wooden cottages along the harborfront.
Sip a Bahama Mama or a Goombay Smash at a waterside restaurant
while you watch the show. (For more information, see Chapter 22.)
Chapter 27: Top Ten Bahamas Moments 345

Visiting a Candy Cane–Striped Lighthouse
Sail through Hope Town Harbor, which is filled with small pleasure
boats, or munch some conch fritters at the water’s edge, and you can
see the whimsical red-and-white striped lighthouse. For a sweeping 
view of narrow Elbow Cay, edged by fabulous beaches, climb to the top
of the beacon, which has stood here since 1838. (See Chapter 19 for
more information.)
Living It Up at Miss Emily’s
In New Plymouth on Green Turtle Cay in the Abacos stands Miss Emily’s
Blue Bee Bar, the most famous watering hole in the Out Islands (see
Chapter 20 for more information). The rum-laced drink, the Goombay
Smash, may as well have been invented here. It’s called the Abacos’
answer to atomic fission. Miss Emily is gone now, but she left her secret
recipe in the hands of her daughter.
Boating in the Abacos
No matter where you’ve boated before, nothing compares to sailing the
Abacos in one of the vessels that you can rent at Marsh Harbour. (See
Chapter 18 for details on how to do so.) Marsh Harbour is aptly known
as “The Boating Capital of The Bahamas.” In charge of your own vessel,
you can visit uninhabited cays and seek out deserted beaches where
you can go shelling, exploring, and picnicking in peace — and no one’s
around to witness if you want to go beachcombing in the buff.

Bahamas is 242.
ATMs
To find an ATM near you, call or check the
Web sites for Cirrus (% 800-424-7787;
www.mastercard.com) and PLUS 
(% 800-843-7587; www.visa.com). See
Chapter 5 for more information about using

bers: American Express, % 800-221-7282
collect; MasterCard, % 800-307-7309; and
Visa, % 800-847-2911.
Currency Exchange
U.S. travelers don’t have to swap their dol-
lars for Bahamian currency because
American green is accepted everywhere.
The exchange rate is $1 to $1, so you won’t
have any confusion. Other travelers can
exchange currency at the Bank of Nova
Scotia, with branches throughout The
Bahamas (go to www.scotiabank.com
for locations).
Electricity
Electricity is normally 120 volts, 60 cycles,
AC. American appliances are fully compat-
ible; British or European appliances need
both converters and adapters.
Embassies and Consulates
The U.S. embassy (% 242-322-1181 or
242-328-2206) is on Queen Street, P.O. Box
N-8197, Nassau. The Canadian consulate
(% 242-393-2123) is on Shirley Street,
Shopping Plaza, Nassau. The British High
Commission (% 876-510-0700) is in
Kingston, Jamaica, at 28 Trafalgar Road.
Emergencies
Throughout most of The Bahamas, the
number to call for a medical, dental, or
hospital emergency is % 911. In the Out
Islands, the number is % 919. To report a
fire, call % 411.
Etiquette and Customs
When you encounter someone, even a
stranger in the Out Islands, exchanging
greetings is customary. A “good morning”
or “good afternoon” suffices. But that
custom doesn’t prevail in bustling Freeport

and Nassau. Also, rushing up to someone
and demanding that he supply you with
directions to a place is impolite anywhere;
Bahamians gently lead into conversations
with a greeting and friendly comments
before getting down to business.
Business in offices is conducted rather
formally with exchange of business cards,
elaborate handshakes, and the like. If
you’re doing business in The Bahamas,
wear business clothes as you would to any
office in America. Don’t show up in resort
wear or shorts for any formal meetings or
functions.
When leaving the beach, men should put
on a shirt and pants, even a pair of jeans,
before heading into a town. Women should
wear a cover-up over their bathing suit, or
else slip into a tropical dress or pants.
If you’re planning to attend religious serv-
ices, wear the best clothes you brought
along. Bahamians believe in dressing up
for their “Sunday-go-to meeting.”
Regardless of how colorful an islander
may look, photographing anyone without
permission is extremely rude.
Internet Access
Access is limited on the islands. Cybercafe,
located in The Mall at Marathon (% 242-
394-6254) in Nassau, is open daily from 
10 a.m. to 8 p.m., charging 15¢ per minute;
four computers are available. In the Out
Islands, you can usually access the Web
from your hotel. For more tips about staying
in touch, see Chapter 9.
Liquor and Drug Laws
Liquor is sold in liquor stores and various
convenience stores; it’s readily available at
all hours, although it’s not sold on Sundays.
The legal drinking age is 18.
Importing, possessing, or dealing in unlaw-
ful drugs, including marijuana, is a serious
offense in The Bahamas that carries heavy
penalties. Customs officers may conduct
body searches for drugs or other contra-
band goods at their discretion.
Mail and Postage Rates
Most of the kiosks selling postcards also
sell the Bahamian stamps you need to mail
them, so you probably won’t need to visit
the post office. Sending a postcard or an
airmail letter (up to 1⁄2-oz. in weight) from
The Bahamas to anywhere outside its bor-
ders (including the U.S., Canada, and the
U.K.) costs 65¢, with another 24¢ charged
for each additional half-ounce of weight.
Mail to and from the Out Islands is some-
times slow. Airmail may go by air to
Nassau and by boat to its final destination.
If a resort has a U.S. or Nassau address,
using it is preferable.
Police
Dial % 911. In the Out Islands, the number
is % 919.
Safety
When going to Nassau (New Providence),
Cable Beach, Paradise Island, or Freeport/
Lucaya, exercise the same caution you
would if you were visiting a large U.S. city
like Miami. 
Women, especially, should take caution
when walking alone on the streets of
Nassau after dark, particularly if those
streets appear deserted. Pickpockets work
the crowded casino floors of both Paradise
Beach and Cable Beach. See that your
wallet, money, and valuables are well
secured.
If you’re driving a rental car, always make
sure that you lock the car door and never
Bahamas For Dummies, 4th Edition 
348

leave possessions in view. Don’t leave
valuables, such as cameras and purses,
unattended on the beach while you go for
a swim. If you’re traveling with valuables,
especially jewelry, don’t leave them
unguarded in hotel rooms. Many of the
larger hotels provide safes. Keep your
hotel room doors locked at all times.
You’re less likely to be mugged or robbed
in the Out Islands, where life is generally
more peaceful. Some resort hotels, even
today, don’t have locks on the doors there.
Smoking
The Bahamas don’t have any general
restrictions against smoking in public
places, so the smoking policy depends on
the individual restaurant or bar. Most of
them designate smoking versus nonsmok-
ing areas and keep their premises well
ventilated.
Taxes
Departure tax is $15 ($18 from Grand
Bahama Island) for visitors ages 7 and up.
You’re also charged an 8 percent tax on
hotel bills; otherwise, The Bahamas don’t
have sales tax.
Telephone
To call The Bahamas from the U.S. or
Canada, dial 1-242 plus the seven-digit
local number. From the U.K., dial 001-242
plus the local seven-digit number.
To make a direct international call from
The Bahamas to the U.S. or Canada, dial 1
plus the area code and local number. To
call other countries, dial 011 plus the coun-
try code (the U.K. is 44, for example), the
area code (usually without its initial zero),
and the local number.
For local calls within The Bahamas, simply
dial the seven-digit number. To call from
one island to another within The Bahamas,
dial 1-242 and then the seven-digit local
number.
Old coin-operated phones are still preva-
lent in The Bahamas. Each local call costs
25¢; you can use either Bahamian or U.S.
quarters. But those old phones are gradu-
ally being replaced by phones that use
calling cards that come in denominations
of $5, $10, $20, and $50. You can buy calling
cards from any office of BATELCO
(Bahamas Telephone Co.).
BATELCO’s main branch (% 242-302-7000)
is on Kennedy Drive, Nassau, although a
popular local branch lies in the commer-
cial heart of Nassau, on East Street off Bay
Street.
To get directory assistance within The
Bahamas, dial % 916. To reach an interna-
tional or a domestic operator within The
Bahamas, dial 0. No distinction is made in
The Bahamas between the two types of
operators.
To reach the major international services
of AT&T, dial % 800-CALLATT from any
phone, or head for any phone with AT&T 
or USA DIRECT marked on the side of the
booth. Picking up the handset connects
you with an AT&T operator. You often find
these phones beside cruise-ship docks to
help passengers disembarking on shore
leave for the day. You can reach MCI at 
% 800-888-8000.
Time Zone
All islands in The Bahamas are on eastern
standard time. The islands also observe
daylight saving time in the summer.
Water
Technically, tap water is drinkable
throughout The Bahamas. But we almost
always opt for bottled. Resorts tend to filter
and chlorinate tap water more aggressively
Appendix: Quick Concierge 349

than other establishments; anywhere else,
you can get bottled water at stores and
supermarkets, and it tastes better than
water from a tap.
On many of the Out Islands, rainfall is the
main source of water. Definitely drink bot-
tled water when you’re there.
Weather
Call % 915 to hear the forecast. Before
your trip or if you have Internet access
while in the islands, check out www.
weather.com.
Weddings

getting married in The Bahamas.
