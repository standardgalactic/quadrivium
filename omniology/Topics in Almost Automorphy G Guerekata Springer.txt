In memory of Therese N^Guerekata, my mother 

Preface 
Since the publication of our first book [80], there has been a real 
resiu-gence of interest in the study of almost automorphic functions 
and their applications ([16, 17, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 40, 41, 42, 46, 
51, 58, 74, 75, 77, 78, 79]). New methods (method of invariant sub-
spaces, uniform spectrum), and new concepts (almost periodicity 
and almost automorphy in fuzzy settings) have been introduced 
in the literature. The range of applications include at present 
linear and nonlinear evolution equations, integro-differential and 
functional-differential equations, dynamical systems, etc...It has 
become imperative to take a bearing of the main steps of the the-
ory. 
That is the main purpose of this monograph. It is intended 
to inform the reader and pave the road to more research in the 
field. It is not a self contained book. In fact, [80] remains the basic 
reference and fimdamental source of information on these topics. 
Chapter 1 is an introductory one. However, it contains also 
some recent contributions to the theory of almost automorphic 
functions in abstract spaces. 

VIII 
Preface 
Chapter 2 is devoted to the existence of almost automorphic 
solutions to some Unear and nonUnear evolution equations. It con-
tains many new results. 
Chapter 3 introduces to almost periodicity in fuzzy settings 
with applications to differential equations in fuzzy settings. It is 
based on a work by B. Bede and S. G. Gal [40]. 
Finally in Chapter 4 the classical theory of almost automorphic 
vector-valued functions is extended to fuzzy settings. This chap-
ter begins with the presentation of several "new" spaces in which 
the theory holds, called fuzzy-number type spaces. These spaces 
are more general than the Banach and Frechet spaces, since they 
are not linear structures although they present nice metric prop-
erties. Their importance consists in the fact that they are very 
appropriate for situations where imprecision which appears in the 
modelization of real world problems by differential equations is due 
to imcertainty or vagueness (and not randomness). Applications 
to some fuzzy differential equations are also given. It is based on 
S. G. Gal and G. M. N'Guerekata's recent work [41]. 
At the end of each chapter, we recall some relevant bibliograph-
ical remarks and raise some open problems and/or potential re-
search subjects for graduate students and begining researchers in 
the area. It is our hope that this monograhp be used to stimu-
late some seminars and graduate courses in Analysis, D3niamical 
Systems, Fuzzy Mathematics and other branches of Mathematics. 
Ackowledgements. I like to express my deepest gratitude to 
my colleagues and friends Professors D. Bugajewski and S. G. Gal

Introduction and Preliminaries 
This chapter has an introductory character to this monograph. We 
wish to recall briefly some concepts, results, methods and notations 
that will be used in the sequel. We will indicate in general some 
references where the reader can find more informations if neces-
sary. Although for almost automorphy, our book [80] remains the 
main sotu-ce of information, we give detailed proofs to some new 
results. 
1.1 Measurable Functions 
In this section we will recall some facts about measurable vector-
valued functions and their integrals. We consider (X, ||.||) a Banach 
space and / an open interval in E. We denote by Cc(/; X) the 
Banach space of continuous functions f : I -^ X with compact 
support in /. 
Definition lA. A function f : I -^ X is said to be measurable 
if there exists a set S C I of measure 0 and a sequence (fn) C 
Cc{I]X) such that fn{t) -^ f{t) asn-^oo, 
for all t G I\S. 

2 
1 Introduction and Preliminaries 
We observe that if / : / -> X is measurable, then ||/|| : I —^R 
is measurable too. 
Theorem 1.2. Let /^ : / -^ X, n = 1,2... be a sequence of mea-
surable functions and suppose that f : I -¥ X and fn{t) —>/(<) as 
n —> GO, for almost all t e I. Then f is measurable. 
Proof. We have /n -> / on /\5', where 5 is a set of measure 0. Let 
{fn,k)k€N be a sequence of functions in Cc{I] X) such that /n^jt -^ fn 
almost everywhere on / as A; —> oo. By Egorov's Theorem (see [90, 
p. 16]) applied to the sequence of functions ||/n,A; —/n||, there exists 
a set Sn C I o{ measure less than ^ such that fn,k ~> fn uniformly 
on I\Sny as A: -> CO. 
Now let k(n) be such that \\fn,k{n) " /nil < ^ on I\Sn and 
Fn = fnMny Also let B = 5'U(nm>iUn>m^n). Then it is dear 
that B is a subset of / of measure 0. Take t G I\B. So we get 
fn(t) -^ f{t)y OS n --> oo. On the other hand if n is large enough, 
t e /\5n. It follows that jjFn - /nil < ^. Which means Fn{t) -> 
/(t), as n —> oo, and consequently, / is measurable. D 
Remark 1.3. It is easy to observe that if 0 : / -> R and f : I -^ X 
are measurable, the (/>f : I —> X is measurable too. 
Theorem 1.4. (Pettis' Theorem) A function f : I -^ X is mea-
surable if and only if the following two conditions are satisfied: 
(a) f is weakly measurable (i.e. for every x* E X"", the dual space 
of X, the function (x*/)(<) : I -^R is measurable) 
(b) There exists a set S d I of measure 0 such that f{I\S) 
is 
separable. 

1.1 Measurable Functions 
3 
Proof. See [90, p. 131]. D 
We also have the following 
Theorem 1.5. / / / : / - > X is weakly continuous, then it is mea-
surable. 
Definition 1.6. A measurable function f : I --^ X is said to 
be integrable on I if there exists a sequence of functions fn € 
Cc{I\X), 
n = 1,2,... such that 
f\\fn{t)-f{t)\\dt^O, 
as n->oo. 
Remark 1.7A{ f : I —> X is integrable, it can be shown that there 
exists a vector x G X, such that if fn € Cc{I] X), n = 1,2,.. and 
// l!/n(*) — /(*)IM* -> 0 as n ^ cx), then /^/n -> x as n -^ oo. 
Such X is called the integral of / on / and denoted x := fj f. 
Moreover if / = (a, 6), then we denote ^ -= f^ f* 
Theorem 1.8. (Bochner's Theorem). Assume f : I -^ X is mea-
surable. Then f is integrable if and only if\\f\\ is integrable. More-
over we have 
Proof. Let / : / -> X be integrable. Then by the definition, there 
exist fn e CciI;X), 
n = 1,2,... such that fj \\f(t) - f{t)\\dt -> 0 
as n —>^ oo. 
We have ||/|| < ||/n|| + ||/n-/||, for each n, so ||/|| is integrable. 
Conversely assume now ||/|| is integrable. Let Fn G Cc{I] M), n = 
1,2,... be a sequence of functions such that jj \Fn{t) — \\f{t) \\ \dt -> 

4 
1 Introduction and Preliminaries 
0 as n —> 00 and \Fn\ < F almost everywhere for some F : / —> R, 
with fj\\F{t)\dt< 
oo. 
Since / is measurable, there exist fn € Cc{I\X)^ n = 1,2,... 
such that fn-^f 
almost everywhere. 
We now let 
then it is obvious that ||t6n|| < F for each n = 1,2..., and Un -^ f 
sdmost everyivhere on /. Therefore fj \\un — f\\dt —> 0 as n -> oo 
and so / is integrable. 
Using Lebesgue-Fatou's Lemma (see [90]), we get 
| | / / | | < l u n | | / t . „ | | 
Jl 
n^oo Ji 
< lim / \\un\ 
</11/11. 
The proof is complete. D 
Theorem I.9. (Lebesgue's Dominated Convergence Theorem). Let 
fn : I -^ X^ n = 1,2,... be a sequence of integrable functions and 
g : I -^ R be an integrable function. Let also f : I —^ X and 
assume that: 
(i) for all n = 1,2,... ||/n|| < g, almost everywhere on I, and 
(ii) fn{t) -> f{t), as n-^ oo for all t e I. 
Then f is integrable on I and 
ff= lim //„. 

1.2 Sobolev Spaces 
5 
Definition 1*10« Let 1 <p <oo. We will denote by L^{I;X) 
the 
space of all classes of equivalence (with respect to the equality a.e 
on I) of measurable functions f : I —> X such that \\f\\ € LP{I)-
If we define a norm on LP(I'J X) by 
\\f\\p = (f\\mrdt)-p, 
if i<p<oo 
and 
WfWp- \\f\\oo = esssnp\\f(t)l 
if p = 00, 
I 
then U{I\X) 
is a Banach space. 
We shall denote by Lf^(/;X) the space of all (equivalence 
classes of) measurable functions f : I —^ X such that the re-
striction of / to every bomided subinterval of / is in I^(/; X), 
1.2 Sobolev Spaces 
Let i? C R'^ be an open boimded subset. 
Definition l^ll, A function g € L\^{Q) is said to be the weak 
derivative of a function f € Ll^J^Q) (or a derivative in the sense 
of distributions of order a), if 
f g .(l>dx = {-lp 
f 
f,D''(t>dx, 
forall 
(t>eC^{Q). 
Ja 
Jo 
In this case, we write g = Z?^/. 
Recall that D^f denotes the Of-derivative defined by: 
dMf 
n« f .= 
Z—1 
where a = (ai, 0^2,..., an), a^ (1 < i < n) is a nonnegative integer, 
and \a\ = ai + a2 + ... + otn-

1 Introduction and Preliminaries 
Definition 1.12* Let k be a non-negative integer and let 1 <p < 
oo. We define the Sobolev space W^'P(Q) 
by 
W^^^n) := {f e L^{fi) : D^^feL^iQ) 
for all \a\ < k}. 
In W^'^{fi), we define a norm by 
iN)k,p 
\\f\\l,,:= 
f 
E 
P V ( x ) r d x , 
p < o o , 
iN)k,oo 
||/|U,oo:=niax||D-/|U, 
\oi\<k 
and for p = 2, we define an inner product 
We have the following 
Theorem 1.13. The space W^'^{fi) is a Banach space. Ifp < oo, 
it is separable. 
Also we have 
Definition 1.14. By Wjf'^(i?) we denote the closure ofC^{Q) 
in 
14^*^'P(i7). (CQ^{Q) denotes the space of functions of class C^ with 
compact support in Q. 
Definition 1.15. We define H^{Q) := W^^^{n) and H^{Q) := 
Theorem 1.16. H^{Q) and HQ{0) are Hilbert spaces when en-
dowed with the inner product {N)k,2' 
Theorem 1.17. C^(i7)nif^(r2) is dense inH^{Q), where C^(r2) 
is the space of functions defined on Q of class C^. 

1.3 Semigroups of Linear Operators 
7 
1.3 Semigroups of Linear Operators 
Definition 1.18. Let A : X -¥ X be a linear operator with domain 
D{A) cX,ina 
Banach space (X, |H|). The family T = {T{t))teR+ 
of bounded linear operators on X is said to be a Co-semigroup if 
i) For all x E X, the mapping T(t)x :R'^ -^ X is continuous; 
ii) T(t + s) = T{t)T(s) for all <, 5 € M"^ (semigroup property); 
Hi) T(0) = I, the identity operator. 
The operator A is called the infinitesimal generator (or generator 
in short) of the Co-semigroup T if 
T{t)x - X 
Ax = lim 
where 
D{A) ^ixeXj 
lim ^^^^"^ 
"^ exists \ . 
(^ 
t-^Q-^ 
t 
J 
It is observed that A commutes with T{t) on D{A). We define a 
Co-group in a similar way, replacing R"^ by M. 
For a bounded linear operator A, we have 
T{t) := e'^ = Y. 
°° t'^A'^ 
n=0 
We also have the exponential growth: 
Proposition 1.19. (see [90] page 232). If T ^ (T(t))t€R+ is a 
Co-semigroup then there exist K > 0 and a; < oc such that 
\\T{t)\\ < Kc""', 
forallteR^. 
If u; < oo, we say that T is exponentially stable. 

8 
1 Introduction and Preliminaries 
Proposition 1.20. IfT = {T{t))teisi^ is a Co-semigroup, then: 
a) the function t —> ||T(f))||; M"^ -^ R"*" is measurable and bounded 
on any compact interval o/R"^. 
b) the domain D{A) of its generator is dense in X. 
c) the generator A is a closed linear operator. 
1.4 Fractional Powers of Operators 
Let (X, ||.||) be a (complex) Banach space and let C : D{C) C 
X »-> X be a densely defined closed imboimded linear operator 
acting in X. Assume that —C is the infinitesimal generator of an 
analytic semigroup {R{t)) and that 0 € p(C7), where p{C) is the 
resolvent of the operator C Then one can define, for 0 < a < 1, 
the fractional powers of C^. 
It is well-known that C : D ( C ) C X H^ X is a densely defined 
closed linear operator. Further, its domain D{C^) is endowed with 
the norm defined as 
||x|U = IIC^xll, 
ioTxeD{C^). 
Since C is closed, then it can be easily shown that X^ = 
{D{C^)^ \\.\\a) is also a Banach space. 
Recall that if — C is the infinitesimal generator of an analytic 
semigroup {R{t)) and that 0 € p(C), for a > 0, the fractional 
powers C" of C are implicitly defined as 
1 
r^ 
r{oi) Jo 
where r{a) is the classical Gamma function. 

1.5 Evolution Equations 
9 
In the case where 0 < a < 1, since 0 € p(C7), then the operator 
C""^ is boimded, that is, there exists K >Q such that ||C~''|| < K. 
Theorem 1.21. Under the above assumptions on the operator C, 
we have 
(ii) Uma_>o C^ = I (strong operator topology). 
Proof. See [83] for instance. 
We also recall the following. 
Lemma 1.22. Let —C be the infinitesimal generator of an ana-
lytic semigroup R{t). Assume that 0 G p(C). 
Then for a > 0, we have the following: 
1. for every u G i5(C^), R{t)C'^u = C''R{t)u. Moreover 
CRit) 
is bounded, with an estimate of the form 
2. If Q < a<l 
and u € D{C^), we have an estimate of the form 
\\Rit)U'-u\\<Cat''\\C''u\\. 
More details on fractional powers of operators can be found in the 
literature, especially in [83]. 
1.5 Evolution Equations 
Unlike the finite dimensional case, the infinite dimensional theory 
of evolution equations has several notions of solutions. We will 

10 
1 Introduction and Preliminaries 
present two of them in this section : the so-called classical solutions 
and mild solutions. We first consider in a Banach space (X, ||.||) 
the Abstract Cauchy Problem (ACP) 
x\t) = Ax{t) (t > 0) x{0) =xoe 
D{A) 
(1.1) 
where A : D(A) C X —>- X is a linear operator densely defined 
in X, We have: 
Definition 1.23. The problem (1.1) is said to be well-posed if 
p{A) ^ 0 and for each XQ G D{A), there exists a unique (clas-
sical) solution X : [0,oo) »-> D{A) in C^([0,oo),X). 
It is well-known that "well-posedness" of (1.1) involves more 
than existence and uniqueness of solutions, and continuous depen-
dence on the initial data. Indeed we have: 
Theorem 1,24. The problem (LI) above is well-posed iff A gen-
erates a Co-semigroup of linear operators T = T(t))t^^^^ on X. In 
this case, the (classical) solution of (LI) is given by the formula 
x(f) = T(t)xo, t e R + . 
For the proof, refer for instance to [45], pages 83-84. 
We now consider the linear non-homogeneous equation 
x\t)=Ax{t)-^f{t), 
t e M + 
(1.2) 
with initial data 
x{Q) = xo € X 
(1.3) 
We assimae that A is the infinitesimal genarator of a C( 
semigroup T = (T{t))teR^, and / € L/^(R+,X). Then we have: 
0" 

1.5 Evolution Equations 
11 
Definition 1«25. A function x :W' \-^ X is said to he a mild so-
lution of the Abstract Cauchy Problem (1,2)'(1.3) ifx € C(M+,X) 
and satisfies the equation 
x{t) = T{t)x{a) + f T{t- 
s)f{s)ds, 
(1.4) 
Ja 
for any a G R, and any t> a. 
This formula is also called the Variation of Constants Formula. 
We also have: 
Definition 1-26. Iffe 
C{R-^,X), then a function x : R+ i-> X 
is said to be a classical solution of the Problem (1.2)-(1.3) if: 
(i) X e C(R+, X) and x{0) = XQ 
(a) X is strongly differentiable in X at each t € R"*" 
(Hi) X satisfies the equation (1.2) in X everywhere on (0, oo) 
(iv)x\t) 
e L/^(R+,X) and satisfies 
x{t) = x{a) + / x\s)ds, 
for all a G R, all t> a. 
Ja 
It is clear that classical solutions are mild solutions too. The 
converse is not always true. 
We have the following (see [45, p. 84]): 
Theorem 1.27* Suppose A generates a Co-semigroup on X and 
Xo G D{A). Assume either 
(i) f G C{R-^,X) takes values in D{A) and Af G (7(R+, X), or 
(n)feC\R^,X). 
Then the Abstract Cauchy Problem (1.2)-(1.3) has a unique 
(classical) solution with x : [0,oo) ^ D{A) such that x{0) = XQ* 

12 
1 Introduction and Preliminaries 
Theorem 1.28. Assume that A generates a Co-semigroup on X 
andfeLUR-^,X), 
Then a mild solution x : [0, oo) ^ X of the (ACP) is a classical 
solution if and only if both of the following conditions are satisfied: 
(i)x{t) € D{A) almost everywhere on [0,oo)^ and 
(ii)Ax e LUR'-^X), 
i.e. X G L]^{ 
R-'.D(A)). 
See for instance [87, p. 149] for the proof. 
1.6 Almost Automorphic Functions 
Definition 1.29. Let {X, ||.||) be a (real or complex) Banach space 
and f : R -^ X a (strongly) continuous function. We say that f 
is almost automorphic if for every sequence of real numbers (s!^), 
there exists a subsequence (sn) such that: 
lim lim f{t + 5n - Sm) = fit) 
for each t 
eR. 
This limit means that: 
g{t):= \\m f{t + Sn) 
o 
is well defined for each t £R and 
lim g{t - Sn) = f{t) 
n~^oo 
for each t € R. 

1.6 Almost Automorphic Functions 
13 
Remark 1.30. We observe that the function g{t) m Definition 1.29 
is measurable but not necessarily continuous. 
If the convergence above is uniform on R, the function / is said 
to be almost periodic (in Bochner's sense). 
Also if the convergence above holds in the weak topology of X, 
that is 
g{t) ~w- 
lim f{t + Sn) 
is well defined for each t € E and 
It; - hm 5(< - Sn) = f{t) 
n->oo 
for each t e M, 
we say that / is weakly almost automorphic. 
Clearly almost automorphy implies weak-almost automorphy. 
The reader can find more informations on weak almost automor-
phy m [80]. 
We end these remarks by the following important result (see 
Theorem 2.1.10 in [80]): 
If /n : M >-> X, n = 1,2..., is a sequence of almost automorphic 
functions such that limn-^oo /n(*) =/(*)> uniformly in i G R, then 
/ is also almost automorphic. 
Theorem 1 . 3 1 . / / / , /i,/2 : K -> X are almost automorphic 
functions , then the following are true: 
i) /i + /2 ^ almost automorphic . 
ii) cf is almost automorphic for every scalar c. 
Hi) fa(t) = f(t + a) is almost automorphic for each fixed a € R. 
iv)sup^^jg^ \\f{t)\\ < 00; that is f is a bounded function. 

14 
1 Introduction and Preliminaries 
v) The range Rf = {/(<) : t E R} of f is relatively compact in 
X. 
Proof: See [80] . D 
Proposition 1.32. We have 
(i) sup^^K \\9{t)\\ = supt^R \\f{t)\\ 
(a) Rg Q Rf, where g is the function that appears in Definition 
1.29. 
Let us first recall the following. 
Lemma 1.33. (see [90]) 
(i) Weakly hounded sets are hounded (in norm) in any Banach 
space {X, \\.\\)j and 
(a) if W'limn^oo ^n = ^y then \\x\\ < liminf„,^oo H^^nll; o,nd the 
sequence {\\Xn\\) is bounded. 
Now we prove Proposition 1.32. 
Proof, (i) Since g{t) = limn->oo /(* + Sn), we may use the above 
Lemma to get, for each t G M, the inequality 
so that 
11^(011 <liminf||/(< + 5„)|| 
sup||5(i)ll<sup||/(i)||. 
The reverse inequality is proved the same way. 
(ii) is straightforward. 
D 
We also establish the following composition result: 

1.6 Almost Automorphic Functions

Theorem 1*34. Let X^Y be two Banach spaces with norms H-Hx 
and \\.\\Y respectively, and let f : R -^ X be an almost automor-
phic function. If (f> : X —^ Y is a continuous function, then the 
composite function (f>{f{t)) :R-^Y 
is almost automorphic. 
Proof: Since / is almost automorphic, /(R) is compact in X by 
Theorem 1.31 v). We deduce that <^ restricted to /(M) is uniformly 
continuous. So given e > 0, there exists ^ > 0 such that 
\\(l){xi)-(t){x2)\\Y <e, 
for any 0:1,0:2 e/(M) 
with \\xi — X2\\x < <^-
Let {s*^ be an arbitrary sequence of real numbers. There exists 
a subsequence (^n) C (5^) such that

lim g{t - Sn) = fit)

for each t

Note that <j) is well-defined on p(R), since g{R) C f{R) (Propo-
sition 1.32 ii)). Therefore there exists N eN such that if n > iV, 
we have

Analogously, we can prove that 
lim <l>(g{t-sn)) = (f>{m)

for each < € R. So that t —^ 0(/(O) is almost automorphic. The 
proof is now complete. D 
Proposition 1.35. Let <;6 : R -> C and / : R -> X 6e almost 
automorphic where X is a complex Banach space. Then (/>f :R --^ 
X defined by {<})f){t) = ^(t)f{t) 
is also almost automorphic. 
Proof. Both functions 0 and / are bounded since they are gJmost 
automorphic {Theorem 1.31 iv)). So we let Ki = sup^^j^ 1^(01-
Let (in) be an arbitrary sequence of real nmnbers. Then there 
exists a subsequence {sn) of {t^) such that: 
v{t) := lim (t>{t + Sn) 
n->oo 
is well-defined for each t € R, and 
lim v{t — Sn) = (t>{t) 
for each

Also 
g{t) := lim f(t + Sn)

is well-defined for each i € R, and

lim g(t - Sn) = f(t)

Now write

where K2 = supt^jj ||^(t)|| = sup^eR ||/(0|| < co (Proposition 1.32

Clearly when n -> 00, we obtain 
lim (f>(t + Sn)fit + Sn) = v(t)g(t)

for each t e R. 
It is also easy to check that 
lim vit - Sn)g{t - Sn) = 4>{t)fif) 
for each t e M. 
The proof is now complete. D 
The following result is important in view of its applications to 
the theory of evolution equations (see for instance Chapter J2, [80]). 
Theorem 1*36. Let T = (T(i))tGR be a one parameter group of 
strongly continuous linear operators such that sup^^j^ ||T(t)|| =

1 Introduction and Preliminaries 
M < oo. Let f :R -^ X be an almost automorphic function 
and 
S = f{Q), where Q denotes the set of rational numbers, with the 
property that the function T{t)x : R ^ X is almost automorphic 
for each x G 5. 
Then T{t)f{t) : R ~> X Z5 almost automorphic. 
Proof: Let B = {f{t) 
: t e R} be the range of / . Then S is 
a countable subset of B. It is also dense in S, the closure of B, 
Indeed it is known that if ^ is a continuous function g : Xi -^ X2 
where Xi and X2 are two topological spaces and A C Xi, then 
g{A) C 9(A). 
Since / is continuous and Q = R, then we have 
B = /(R) = /(Q) C /(Q) = S 
That is S = B since 5 is a subset of B] which proves oin: claim. 
Let S = (xn); then T(t)xn is almost automorphic for each n = 
1,2, 
Consider an arbitrary sequence of real numbers {s'^. Using 
the well known Cantor diagonal procedure we can show that there 
exists a subsequence {s^) of (5^) such that 
lim T{sn)x exists for every x E S. 
Pick XQ arbitrary in B, For any n, m, k we have 
\\T{Sn)Xo - T{s^)Xo\\ < \\T{Sn)Xo - T{Sn)Xk\\

\\T{Sn)Xk-T{Sm)Xk\\

T{Sra)Xk\\

< 2M||Xo - XkW + ||T(5n)Xfc - T(s^)Xfc||. 
Now, since X]^ € 5, (T(5i)xfc)ieN is a Cauchy sequence because it 
is convergent as seen above. 
Thus 
lim 
\\T{Sr,)Xk-T{Sm)Xk\\=Q 
and consequently: 
lim \\T{sn)x^ - T{s^)x^\\ < 2M||xo - Xi,\\. 
Therefore, using the fact that S is dense in B , we can say that 
lim T'(5n)xo exists for every XQ € B. 
Now we observe that lim^-^oo ^(^n)^ = V defines a mapping F 
from the linear subspace spanned by B into X, namely 
Fx = y if 
lim T(sn)x = y. 
The map F has the following properties: 
i) F is linear, 
ii) ||Fx|| = ||y|| < limn->oo ||T(5n)x|| < M||x|| 
for every x in the 
subspace spanned by S, 
iii) F is one-to-one, 
iv) If (xn) is a given sequence in B such that strong-limn->oo Xn = x 
exists, then 
strong-limn-^oo T{sn)xn = Fx, and strong-limn--)^oo Fxn = Fx. 

20 
1 Introduction and Preliminaries 
Let Rp = {Fx : x E B} be the range of F, Then we observe 
that F{S) = RF and Rp is compact in X. Let us show that 
lim T{—Sn)y exists for every y e Rp* 
n->oo 
It suffices to prove that 
hm T(sn)ym 
exists for every y^ € F(S), 
n->oo 
where ym = Fxm, m = 1,2,.... 
Since T(t)xm is almost automorphic for each m = 1,2,... we 
have 
lim T{t + Sn)xm = lim T{t)T{sn)xm 
n—foo 
n->oo 
= T(t) lim T{Sn)Xm 
= T(t)ym 
pointwise on R. Also we have 
lim T{t - Sn)ym = 
T{t)Xm 
n->oo 
= T{t) lim 
T{-s^)ym. 
n—yoo 
Now, for t = 0, we get 
lim T(—5n)t/m exists for m = 1,2,... 
and T(0)a:m = ^m- Hence, we have 
lim T{—Sn)y exists for every y € /?F-
n—^oo 
This defines a linear function G on the hnear subspace spanned 
by Rp where 

1.6 Almost Automorphic Functions 
21 
Gy = lim T{-Sn)y-
It is easy to verify that G has the same properties as did F and 
we observe that 
GFx = X for every x £ B. 
Let (5^) be an arbitrary sequence of real numbers. Then we can 
extract a subsequence {sn) such that 
lun fit + Sn) = g{t) 
n—>oo 
and 
Um g{t - Sn) = f{t) 
n-4oo 
pointwise on M, and 
Um T{'-Sn)x = y exists for each x £ B. 
Now let us observe that for every t € M and n = 1,2,... we have 
f{t + Sn), 
9it)eB. 
Let t be arbitrary in R. Then for every n = 1,2,..., we get 
T{t + Sn)f{t + Sn) = T{t)T{Sn)fit + 5^) 
so that 
lim T{t + Sn)f{t + Sn) = T{t)Fg{t) 
and 
lim T{t - Sn)Fg{t ~ Sn) = T{t) lim T{-Sn)Fg(t - Sn) 
= T(i)GF/(i) 
=mm, 
since /(t) G B, The theorem is proved. D 

22 
1 Introduction and Preliminaries 
Theorem 1.37. Assume that (T{t))t>o is a Co-group of bounded 
linear operators on X and let x{t) = T{t)xo is almost automorphic 
for some XQ € X. 
Then 
inf \\x{t)\\ > 0, or x(t) = 0 for every t € M. 
Proof: Assume that infteu ||^(*) || = 0 and let (s!^) be a minimizing 
sequence of real numbers, that is limn_foo lk(^n)l| = 0. We can 
extract a subsequence (sn) Q (s!^) such that 
y{t) := lim x(t + Sn) 
n->oo 
is well defined for each f € R, and 
lim y(t - Sn) = x{t) 
n-4oo 
for each « € M. 
We also have 
X{t + Sn) = T{t + Sn)Xo = T{t)T{Sn)Xo 
= 
T{t)x{Sn). 
Thus 
y{t) = Um a:(£ + Sn) = T{t) lim x{sn) = 0, 
n-4oo 
n—¥oo 
for each t e M; which shows that y(t) = 0 for each t € E and 
consequently x{t) = 0 identically on R. D 
Differentiability and integration of almost automorphic func-
tions are presented in [80]. We recall the following important Bohr-
Amerio type result: 

1.6 Almost Automorphic Functions 
23 
If f : R -^ X is almost aumorphic and F : R -^ X defined by 
F{t) := JQ f{t)dt has a relatively compact range in X, then F is 
also almost automorphic. 
In the cose X is a uniformly convex Banach space, the conclu-
sion holds true if the range of F is bounded in X, 
In conclusion to this section, let ns note that the set 
AA{X) 
of all almost automorphic functions M -^ X, {{X, \\  ||) a Banach 
space), is a linear vector space in view of Theorem LSI. 
Equipped with the norm 
||/IU^W=sup||/(i)||, 
AA{X) turns out to be a Banach space in view of the above 
remarks. 
1.6*1 Asymptotically Almost Automorphic Functions 
Definition 1.38* Let {X, \\  (|) be a (real or complex) Banach 
space. A continuous function f : R^ -> X is said to be asymp-
totically almost automorphic if it admits a decomposition 
fit) = git) + hit), 
teR-^ 
where g :R-^ 
X is an almost automorphic function, h : R'^ -^ X 
is a continuous function with limt^oo ||^(*)|| = 0-
g and h are called respectively the principal and corrective terms 
of the function f. 
We have the following immediate facts (see [80] for details): 

24 
1 Introduction and Preliminaxies 
Theorem 1.39. If f,f 1^/2 are asymptotically almost automor-
phic, then /i + /2 and Xf, A an arbitrary scalar, are also asymp-
totically almost automorphic. 
We also have the important restilt: 
Theorem 1.40. The decomposition of an asymptotically almost 
automorphic function is unique. 
Denote AAA{X) 
the linear vector space of all assonptotically 
almost automorphic functions / : R~*" H> X. It is clear that the 
formula: 
WfWAAAW = Mt)\\AA(X) + sup \\h{t)\\ 
(1.5) 
where g and h are the principal and corrective terms of / , respec-
tively, defines a norm on the space 
AAA{X), 
The following holds true. 
Theorem 1.41. AAA{X) 
is a Banach space. 
Proof: Let (/n) be a Cauchy sequence in AAA{X), 
with (p^) 
and {hn) as respective principal and corrective terms. It is clear 
that {Qn) is a Cauchy sequence in the Banach space of all almost 
automorphic functions AA{X), Thus there exists g € AA{X) such 
that gn -^ g uniformly on R. 
Moreover the corrective terms (hn) also form a Cauchy sequence 
of continuous functions with respect to the norm sup. 
We then deduce that there exists a function h € 
C{R^yX), 
such that hn ^ h imiformly on M^.. Using the fact that for each

n = 1,2,..., liint_yoo ||/in(OII = ^J ^^^ the equality h{t) — (h(t) — 
hn{t)) + hnit) for < € R+, we obtain 
lim |lMf)|| = 0. 
t->oo 
This implies that the function / defined as f := g + h E AAA{X) 
and limn->oo \\fn — f\\ = 0, thus AAA{X) is a Banach space. D 
1.6.2 Applications to Abstract Dynamical Systems 
In this section, we will study the behavior of asymptotically almost 
automorphic semigroups of linear operators T = (T'(t))teR+ as t 
tends to infinity. We will present some topological and asymptotic 
properties based on the classical Nemytskii-Stepanov theory of 
dynamical systems. 
First of all we present a connection between the so-called ab-
stract dynamical systems and Co-semigroups of linear operators. 
(X, II  II) will denote a Banach space (over K or C). 
Definition 1.42. A mapping u : R"^ x X -^ X is called an (ab-
stract) dynamical system if 
i) u{Q,x) = Xy for every x E X. 
ii)u(-^x) 
: R"*" -^ X is continuous for any t > 0 and right-
continuous att = 0, for each x E X. 
iii)u{t^ *) : X -^ X is continuous for each i € R"^. 
iv)u{t + SjX) = u{t, u{s, x))y for all <, 5 e R"*" and x E X, 
Ifu : R"^ xX is a dynamical system, the mapping u{'^ x) : R"^ ~> X 
will be called a motion originating at x E X. 

26 
1 Introduction and Preliminaries 
Now we are ready to state and prove the following basic result: 
Theorem 1.43. Every Co-semigroup iT{t))t^^+ determines a dy-
namical system and conversely by defining u{t,x) = T{t)x, t G R.'^, 
XGX, 
Proof: Let u{t, x) be a dynamical system in the sense of Definition 
1.4^ above and consider 
T{t)x = u{t,x), 
f G M^, X G X 
Then obviously T(0) = /, the identity operator on X since for 
every x E X, T{0)x = u(0, x) = x. 
Let t, 5 G K"*" and x G X\ then we have 
T{t + s)x = u{t^ s, x) = u{t, u{Sj x)) 
by property iv) of Definition 1.4^. But we have also 
T{t)T{s)x = T{t)u{s,x) 
= 
T{t,u{s,x)) 
using the definition of T{t)x, Therefore, 
T{t + s)x = 
T{t)T{s)x, 
for every t, 5 G R"^, x G X, which proves the semigroup property 
T(t + s)x = T{t)T{s)x, 
for alH,5GK"^. 
Continuity of T{t)x : X -> X follows readily from property iii) 
of Definition 14^, for every f G M"^. 

1.6 Almost Automorphic Functions 
27 
Now we have 
lim T(t)x = lim u(t, x) = ix(0, x) = x 
using properties ii) then i) in the above Definition 1.42. We have 
proved that {T{t))t^^+ is a Co-semigroup. 
Conversely, suppose we have a Co-semigroup (T(i))tGR+ and 
define uiR-^ 
xX^Xhy 
u{t, x) = T{t)x, 
t € R+, 
xeX. 
Then all properties i)-iv) in Definition 1.42 are obviously true. 
The mapping u is then a dynamical system. 
D 
Theorem 1.43 tells us that the notions of abstract dynamical 
systems and Co-semigroups are equivalent. This fact provides a 
solid groimd to study Co-semigroups of linear operators as an in-
dependent topic. 
In the rest of the section, we will consider a Co-semigroup of 
linear operators T — {T{t))teR+ such that the motion 
T{t)xo :R-^ 
^X 
is in AAA(X) 
with principal term f{t). 
Let us now introduce some notations and definitions. 
We let XQ be some fixed element of X. 
Definition 1.44. A function cp :R --^ X is said to be a complete 
trajectory of T if it satisfies the functional equation 
<p{t)=T{t-a)ip{a), 
for all aER 
and all t> a. 

28 
1 Introduction and Preliminaries 
We have also the following properties. 
Theorem 1A5. The principal term ofT{t)xo 
is a complete tra-
jectory for T. 
Proof: We have T(t)xo = f(t) + h(t), t e R"^. Since / is ahnost 
automorphic, there exists a subsequence (uk) C (n) = N such that 
g{t) := lim f{t + Uk) 
is well-defined for each t 6 ]R and 
lim g{t ~ Tik) = fit) 
k—^oo 
pointwise on R. 
Put ip{t) = T{t)xo. Then (p{0) = XQ. Let us fix a € R and 
choose k large enough so that a + n^ > 0. If 5 > 0, then 
(p{a + s + nk) = T{a + s + nk)(p{0) 
= T{s)T{a + nkMO) 
= T{s)<p{a + nk). 
Consequently, 
f{a + s + rik) +h{a + s + rik) = T(s)(p{a + rik) 
where 5 > 0 and a + n^ > 0. 
But we have 
lim f{a + s + rifc) = g{a + s), lim h{a + 5 + TIA;) = 0, 
SO 

1.6 Almost Automorphic Functions 
29 
lim (p{a + 5 + Uk) = lim T{s)ip{a + Uk) = g{a + 5). 
We also have 
lim (p{a + nk) = g{a). 
k-^00 
Using continuity of T{t),we get 
lim T{s)(p{a + Uk) = T{s)g{a). 
k-¥oo 
We can now establish the following equality 
T(s)g{a) = g{a + s), 
Va e R, V5 > 0. 
But we have 
lim g{t - Uk) = f{t) , for each t eR 
and 
g{a -rik+s) 
= T{s)g{a - Uk) , 
Va G R, 
V5 > 0. 
Therefore 
lim g(a -nk+s) 
= T(s)f{a) 
, 
Va G R, 
V5 > 0 
k-¥oo 
so that 
f{a + 5) = T(s)f(a) 
, 
Va G R, 
V^ > 0. 
Finally let us put s = t — a with t >0. Then 
/(t) = T ( t - a ) / ( a ) , 
VaGR, 
Vt > a. 
The proof is complete. D

1 Introduction and Preliminaxies 
Definition 1.46. The

lim r(t„)xo = y}, 
n-foo 
is called the uj-limit set ofT{t)xQ. 
) = {?/ € X / 3 0 < in -^ 00 : 
lim /(in) = y} 
is called the u>-limit set of f(t), the principal term 
ofT(t)xo. 
y+ixo) = 
{T{t)xo/teR-^} 
is the trajectory ofT{t)xQ. 
We have the following properties. 
Theorem 1.47. a;+(a;o) ^ 0. 
Proof: We let tn = n, n = 1,2,
. Since / E AA{X) 
, there 
exists a subsequence {tnk) C (<„) with tn^. = n* such that 
But 
lim /(t„J = ^(0). 
lim T{tnk)xo = lim /(inj-
k-^oo 
k—^cx> 
We then get 
lim T(tnJxo = g{0). 
k-^oo 
Consequently, 5(0) G a;"^(xo), since tn^ -^ 00 as k -> 00, So a;"^(xo) 
is not empty. 
The proof is complete. D 
Theorem 1A8. a;'^(rco) = ^/(^o)-

1.6 Almost Automorphic Functions 
31 
Proof: To see that T{t)xo and its principal term have the same 
a;-Umit set, it suffices to observe that 
lim T(t)xo = lim f(t). 
The proof is complete. D 
Definition 1.49, A subset B C X is said to be invariant set under 
the semigroup T = {T{t))t^^+ if T{t)y e B for every y e B 
andteR-^, 
Theorem 1.50. a;"^(xo) is invariant under T. 
Proof: Let y € u;"^(xo); then there exists 0 < tn —> oo such that 
limt->oo T{tn)xo = y. 
Consider the sequence (sn) where Sn = t + tn,n = 1,2,
 for a 
given t G R"*". Then 5^ —> oo as n -^ oo. We have 
T{Sn)Xo = T{t)T{tn)xo, 
71 = 1, 2
and limn-^ooT{sn)xo = T(t)y, using continuity of T{t), Therefore 
T{t)yeuj-^{xo). 
This completes the proof. D 
Theorem 1.51* UJ'^{XQ) is closed in X. 
Proof: 
Let y € ct;^"(xo) be the closure of a;^(xo); then there 
exists a sequence of elements ym G a;"^(xo), m = 1,2,... such that 
Vm —^ y- For each ym, there exists 0 < tm,n -^ +oc, as n -^ +oo 
such that lim^^oo ^(^m,n)^o = Z/m- Recursively choose

tk^nk > niax(A:,tjb^i,nfc.J such that \\yk - r(tjb,nJ^o|| < ^ -
Let Sk = tk^uk^k — 1^2,
. Clearly 0 < 5^ —>^ +oo as A; -^ H-oo, 
and we have 
||T(5it)xo - y|| < \\T{sk)xo - VkW + ||2/fc - 2/|| 
Since limjfe_^_,.oo Vk = y^ we have y euj'^{xo)> 
This achieves the proof. D 
Theorem 1.52. uj^{xo) is compact if^^{xo) is relatively compact 
Proof: It is obvious that iV^{xo) C 7"^(xo) the closure of 7"^(xo). 
But 7'*"(a:o) is a compact set and uJ'^{xo) is a closed set (see Theo-
rem 1.51). Therefore a;"^(xo) is itself compact. D 
Theorem 1.53. 7/(a:o) = {f{t) /t e M} is invariant under the 
semigroup T. 
We recall also that 7/(a:o) is relatively compact, since f{t) is 
almost automorphic. 
Proof: Let y G 7/(xo). So there exists a G R such that y = f{cr). 
For arbitrary a 6 M such that a > a, we can write 

1.6 Almost Automorphic Functions 
33 
V = Sip) = Tie - 
a)f(a), 
since / is a complete trajectory Theorem 1.45. Now let < > 0. 
Then 
T(t)y = T(t + a- 
a)f{a) 
i.e., T(t)y € 7/(a:o), V< > 0. 
1ff(xo) is indeed invariant under the semigroup T. 
D 
Theorem 1.54. Let u(t) = mfy^^+^xo) \\T{t)xo - y\\. 
Then 
lim i^(t) = 0. 
Proof: Suppose not, that is limt_>_,_oo ^(t) 7^ 0. Then there exists 
6 > 0 such that for every n = 1,2,
 there exists t!^> n such that 
3 i ; > n , \\T{Oxo-y\\>e 
V^/€ a;+(xo), Vn = 1,2,-... 
Let (tn)^i be a subsequence of (t^)^i such that {f{tn)) converges, 
say to ^, as is guaranteed by the relative compactness of yf(xo). 
Now since i^ ~> 00 as n -> 00, we get 
lim T(tn)xo = lim f(tn) = y. 
Therefore y € a;"^(a:o), which is a contradiction. 
D 
Remark 1.55, This minimality property shows that the a;-liniit set 
UJ'^{XQ) is the smallest closed set towards which the asymptotically 
almost automorphic function T{t)xQ tends as t goes to infinity.

1 Introduction and Preliminaries 
Definition 1.56. e E X is called a rest-point for the semigroup 
T ifT(t)e = e, Vt > 0. 
Theorem 1.57. If XQ is a rest-point of the semigroup T, then 
Proof: Since T{t)xQ = xo, Vt > 0, then for every sequence of real 
ninnbers (tn)^i such that 0 < t^ -> +oo, we get 
lim T{tn)xQ = xo, 
i.e., Xo € U;~^(XQ). 
Now let be y € a;"^(xo). There exists 0 < ^n -^ oo, such that 
\inin-^ooT{sn)xo = y. But T(5n)xo = XQJU = 1,2,--. Therefore 
Xo = 2 / . 
The proof is now complete. D 
1.7 Almost Periodic Functions 
Definition 1.58. Let E — E{T) he a complete Hausdorff locally 
convex space. A continuous function f :R -^ E is said to be almost 
periodic if for each neighborhood of the origin U there exists a real 
number I > 0 such that every interval [a, a + I] contains at least 
one point s such that 
fit + s)- f{t) e U, for every t e R. 
The numbers s depend onU and are called U-translation numbers 
or U-almost periods of the function f. 

1.7 Almost Periodic Functions 
35 
Remark 1.59, Prom Definition 1.58, we observe that for each neigh-
borhood of the origin U, the set of C/-translation numbers is rela-
tively dense in R. 
Theorem 1.60* (i) If f : Ri-¥ E is an almost periodic function, 
then f is uniformly continuous, 
(ii) V ifn) is a sequence of almost periodic functions, /„ : M »-^ 
E, n ^ 1,2,3,... such that (fn) converges uniformly to f on 
R, then f is also almost periodic. 
The following Criterion due to Bochner is a key result. 
Theorem 1.61. ^ochner's Criterion). Let E be a Frechet 
space, that is a Hausdorff locally convex space whose topology is 
induced by a complete and invariant metric. 
Then f € C(R, E) is almost periodic if and only if for every 
sequence of real numbers {s'^, there exists a subsequence (sn) such 
that {f(t + Sn)) converges uniformly m t € M. 
Now we denote AP(E) the set of all almost periodic functions 
R -> £*, where £* is a Frechet space. By Theorem 1.60 axid Theorem 
3.1.3 and Theorem 3.1.9 i) in [80], AP{E) is a linear space. 
We also have the following result (see [16] for details). 
Theorem 1.62. AP{E) is a Frechet space. 
Proof: Denote by C{R,E) 
the linear space of all continuous 
bounded functions R -^ E and by (9^), n € N, the family of 
seminorms which generates the topology r od E. 
Without loss of a generality we may assume that Qn-ti ^ Qm 
pointwise, for n € N. 

36 
1 Introduction and Preliminaries 
Define 
q^{f):=swpqn{f{x)), 
n € N. 
Obviotisly (q^) form a family of seminorms of C(M, E). More-
over, it is clear that q^_^i > q^ for n G N. 
Define the pseudo-norm 
ifi't^TTm ""
-
Obviously C{R^E) with the above defined pseudo-norm is a 
Prechet space. 
Now it is clear that AP(E) is a linear subspace of C(R, E). In 
view of Theorem 1,60 ii) it is closed. This completes the proof. D 
Corollary 1.63. If E is a Banach space, then the linear space of 
all almost periodic functions R ^ E is a Banach space with the 
norm sup. 
We have also the following simple fact. 
Proposition 1.64. Let E be a Prechet space over the field K 
(K = R or C) and assume f G AP{E) and v G AP{K). 
Thenuf 
eAP(E). 
Proof: It is a simple consequence of the Bochner's criterion The-
orem 1.61. 
Definition 1.65. A Prechet space E is said to be perfect if every 
bounded function f :R -^ E with an almost periodic derivative f 
is necesssarily almost periodic. 

1.7 Almost Periodic Functions 
37 
Does there exist a perfect Prechet space which is not a Banach 
space? 
The answer to this question is positive what we illustrate by 
the following. 
Example 1.66. Denote s the linear space of all real sequences: s = 
{x = {xn) : Xn € N forn e N}. 
For each n e N , define Pn{x) =^ \xn\^ x E s. Obviously Pn is a 
seminorm defined on s. 
Define qn := Pi Vp2 V... Vpn for n G N. We have gn+i > Qn for 
neN. 
The space s considered with the family of seminorms (qn) is a 
Prechet space. 
Moreover, it can be proved (see [1] Theorem 17.7, p.210) that 
each closed and bounded subset of s is compact. Thus, in partic-
ular, s is not a Banach space. 
Finally, in view of Theorem 3.2.6 [80], s is perfect. 
It is also possible to enlarge Definition 1.58 to functions of two 
variables of the form f{t,x) 
(see for instance [16]) as follows. 
Definition 1.67. A continuous function f :Rx E -^ E is said to 
be almost periodic in t for each x E E, if for each neighbourhood 
of the origin U, there exists a real number I > 0, such that every 
compact interval of the real line contains at least a point r such 
that 
f(t + r, x) - /(t, x) e U, 
for 
each 
t € M and 
x e E. 

38 
1 Introduction and Preliminaries 
This definition is equivalent to the following, in view of the 
Bochner's Criterion. 
Definition 1.68. A continuous function f{t,x) 
: R x E -^ E 
is almost periodic in t for each x E E if for every sequence of 
real numbers {s!^^), there exists a subsequence (sn) such that the 
sequence (f{t+Sn,x)) 
is uniformly convergent int eR andx G E. 
We finally recall the useful result [16] Lemma 3.8. 
Theorem 1.69. Let f : R x E —^ E be almost periodic in t for 
each t G E, and assume that f satisfies a Lipschitz condition in x 
uniformly int E:R, that is 
p{f{t^x)J{t,y)) 
<Lp{x,y), 
for all t E R and x, 
y E E, where p is a metric on E. Let 
(j> :R-^ 
E be almost periodic. 
Then the function F : R -^ E defined by F{t) = f{t,({){t)) is 
almost periodic.

1.8 Bibliographical Remarks and Open 
Problems 
The study of almost automorphic functions with values in a Ba-
nach space was initiated by M. Zaki in his Ph. D. Thesis con-
ducted imder the supervision of S. Zaidman and published in the 
important paper [101]. After various subsequent contributions by 
S. Zaidman, B. Basit, G. M. N'Guerekata and many others, a sys-
tematic presentation has been made for the first time in [80]. 
To complete the study of vector-valued almost automorphic , 
it would be of great interest to establish the harmonic analysis of 
vector-valued almost automorphic functions. To this end we like 
to indicate the introduction of the notion of imiform spectriun by 
T. Diagana , M.V. Nguyen and G. M. NGuerekata in their recent 
and very important paper [32] that applies to almost autmorphic 
functions as well. 
The Memoirs [88] from W. Shen and Y, Yi are to be cited 
among the most important contributions to the study of almost 
autmorphic functions and their applications to ordinary differen-
tial equations and dynamical systems. 
Theorem 1.37 has a weak version. Indeed, the conclusion holds 
true even if x{t) is weakly almost automorphic (see [79]). 
It would be interesting to pursue the study in [80] Section 2.2 in 
connection with the equation of vibrating string and Probability 
theory. 
Section 1.7^ including the notion of asymptotically almost pe-
riodic functions with values in a Prechet space, is contained in a

broader work by D. Bugajewski and G. M. N'Guerekata presented 
for the first time in [16]. This paper contains also many interest-
ing applications to nonlinear differential and integro differential 
equations in Prechet spaces. 
The definition of asymptotically almost automorphic function 
used here might be generalized in taking for instance the corrective 
term as h £ C(R, X) and limr^oo ^ fir II^^WIM* = 0-

Almost Automorphic Evolution 
Equations 
This chapter presents some of the most recent developments of the 
apphcations of almost automorphy to evolution equations. Some 
existence theorems are presented along with new methods to study 
almost automorphic solutions to linear and nonlinear evolution 
equations. 
2.1 Linear Equations 
2,1.1 The inhomogeneous equation x' = Ax + / 
We consider in a Banach space {X, ||.||) the differential equation 
x\t) = Ax{t) + f{t), 
t e R. 
(2.1) 
We will present various conditions for ensuring almost automorphy 
of the classical and/or mild solutions. 
We start with the simplest case ^ = A G C. 
Theorem 2.1. Let X be a uniformly convex (complex) Banach 
space. Suppose f G AA{X). 
Then every bounded solution of (2.1) is in 
AA{X). 

42 
2 Almost Automorphic Evolution Equations 
Proof: It is easy to check that equation (2.1) admits solutions of 
the form 
e^<*-'")/(r)dr, if R e A > 0 
and 
X2it) = f 
e^^*-^^f(r)dr, if ReA < 0. 
J —OO 
Let us prove that they are almost automorphic. We start with 
Let s = t — r; then we can write 
x^(t) = - I 
e^'f(t-s)ds. 
J —CX) 
Let (5^) be an arbitrary sequence of real numbers. Since / is almost 
automorphic, there exists a subsequence (sn) Q (5^) such that 
lim f{t + Sn) = g{t) 
n—>>oo 
and 
lim g{t - Sn) = fit) 
o 
pointwise on M. So that, if we fix f G R, we can say that 
lim fit- 
s + Sn) = g(t - s) 
o 
for each 5 G R. We have 
xi{t + sn) = - 
e^'f{t -s + Sn) ds. 
J—00 
Let us observe that 
||e^V(t-s + s„)||<e(^«^)^-sup||/(t)|| 
ten 

2.1 Linear £}quations 
43 
and note that the right hand side of the above inequaUty is in 
L^(-~oo,0) since for x, we consider Re A > 0. Now if we apply the 
Lebesgue's Dominated Convergence theorem (Theorem 1.9), since 
g is boimded and measurable over M, we get 
lim xi{t + Sn) = - 
e^^g(t - s) ds := y{t) 
for each < € K. We can apply the same reasoning to obtain 
lim y{t- Sn) = xi{t), 
n-foo 
for each t, which proves almost automorphy of Xi{t). 
The proof of almost automorphy of X2{t) is analogous. 
Now if A = i^ a pure imagin£u*y nimiber, then we get 
x{t) = e'^^xiO) + f e''^f(s)ds, 
t e R 
Jo 
Clearly e*^ is C- almost automorphic since it is almost periodic. 
Therefore e^^^f{s) is almost automorphic too {Proposition i.55). 
^ ^ ^ /o ^^^^f{^)ds is boimded in X for x{t) is bounded. And 
since X is uniformly convex, we deduce that it is almost auto-
morphic. So x € AA{X) as the sum of two almost automorphic 
functions. The proof is now complete. D 
Before we state our next result, let us recall the following defi-
nition: 
Definition 2*2* A linear operator A : D{A) C X -^ X where 
X is a (complex) Banach space is said to be of simplest type 
if A e L{X) 
the space of bounded linear operators in X, and

2 Almost Automorphic Evolution Equations 
A = Y!ik=i ^kPk) where the complex numbers X^ are mutually dis-
tinct, and (Pk)i<k<n forms a complex system Yll^=i Pk = ^ of mu-
tually disjoint projections in X, that is PjPk = SjkPk, where Sjk 
represents the Kronecker's symbol 
Now we have: 
Theorem 2.Z. Assume f € AA{X) where X is a uniformly con-
vex Banach space and A is of simplest type. 
Then every bounded solution of (2.1) is in 
AA{X). 
Proof. Take the projection Pk and apply it to equation (2.1). We 
get 
Pkx\t) = 
j^{Pkxm 
n 
=PkC^\jPMt)+Pkm 
= Xk(Pkx)it) + iPkf)(t). 
Clearly Pkf G AA{X) by Theorem 2.3.6 [80], since Pk € L{X). 
Therefore by Theorem 2.1, P^x € AA{X). We conclude that 
n 
^(*) = E^^^(*)^^^w 
A ; = l 
as a finite sum of ahnost automorphic functions. 
D. 
We now present the following reduction method: 
Theorem 2.4. Let A be a linear operator C^ -> C^ and f{t) : 
R -> C^ an almost automorphic function. 
Then every bounded solution x{t) of (2.1) is almost automor-
phic. 

2.1 Linear Equations 
45 
Proof: Using Proposition 1.3.7 in [80], we let B be an invertible 
linear operator C^ -> C^ such that B~^AB is triangular with the 
representation 
B^^AB = 
/ Ai Ci2
 Cin 
0 A2
 C2n 
\ 0 
0 . . . A n / 
where Ai,..., A^ are the eigenvalues of A. 
Let x{t) be a bounded solution of (2.1) and put y{t) = 
B~^x(t). 
Then t/(i) is also bounded and it satisfies the equation 
y\t) = B-'x'{t) 
= B-^Axit) + 5-V(<) 
It is observed that B''^f{t) : R —) C^ is almost automorphic since 
B^^ is a bounded linear operator (Theorem 2.3.6 [80]). 
We can write the above equation as follows: 
y'l{t) = All/1 (t) + Ci22/2(t) +
 + CinVnit) + Pl(0 
2/2(0 = 
A22/2(t) +
 + C2nyn{t) + 52(t) 
J/n-1 = 
An-l2/n-l(0 + <^-l n2/nW + 5n~l(0 
2/;(«) = 
An2/n(t)+5n(t) 
where 
y(0 = (2/l(t),...,2/nW)€C^

and 
{gi{t),.,.,gn{t)) 
= B-'f{t), 
teR. 
Now, yn{t) is an almost automorphic solution to the last equation 
{Theorem 2.1). We can say that yn-i(<) is also almost automor-
phic and proceed until y\{t), which proves that y G AA{X) 
and 
consequently x = By € AA{X) too. D 
2»1.2 Method of Invariant Subspaces 
In a Hilbert space (if, ||  ||), we consider the differential equation 
x\t) = (A + B)x{t), 
t e M, 
(2.2) 
where both A : D(A) C H h^ H axid B : D(B) C H ^ H are 
densely defined closed linear operators. 
In Section 4-4 [80], equation (2.2) is studied in the case where 
the operator B is boimded, using the so-called method of "decom-
position of spaces". 
Now, when B is unboimded, (that is we have im imboimded 
perttirbation of the almost automorphic equation x^ = Ax), this 
method is no longer efficient. We note that in general the algebraic 
sum A + B is not always well-defined. Let's present some examples 
(see [26, 27]): 
Example: Let H = L^(K) and consider the operators A and B 
defined by 
Au = -u'\ 
D{A)=:H''{R) 
and 
Bu = Qu, D{B) = 
{ueL^R):QueL^{R)}. 

2.1 Linear Equations 
47 
Assume also that (5 : K —) M is a measurable function satisfying 
the assumption: 
(H) 
Q{x) > 0, Q € LHK), and g ^ L^^) 
(ie., f^ \f\^dx = 
DO for every compact [a, 6] C M). 
Then we have: 
Proposition 2*5. f26j Under assumption (H), D(A) D D{B) = 
{0}. 
Proof. Let u G D{A) D D{B) and suppose that u ^ 0. u is con-
tinuous since it is in H^{R). Therefore there exist / C R an open 
subset and S > 0 such that \u{x)\ > S for all x e L 
Now let /' C / be a compact subset equipped with the induced 
topology on /. 
Clearly: Q,,, = ^ ^ \ ^ ^ L^V), 
since (Q|^|)|^, G L\r) 
and 
As a consequence Q G L^il')- This is impossible since Q ^ 
Therefore u = 0. 
Example of Potential Q satisfying (H): Assume that the fimc-
tion / satisfies: 
f >0, f e L^{R) with /^ not integrable near x = 0. 
Let ((Tn)^i be an enimieration of the rational ntimbers, set 
oo 
satisfies the assumption (H). 

48 
2 Almost Automorphic Evolution Equations 
Generalization. Let H = Z/^(E^) and let A, B be the operators 
given by 
Au = -Au, 
D{A) = H''(W) 
and 
Bu = Q% D{B) = {ue 
L2(R^) : Qu e ^^(R^)}, 
where Q : R^ H-> C is a measurable function satisfying 
(H) 
Re Q{x) > 0, Q € L\W), 
and Q ^ ^LCR"") 0^-. 
/^ l / P ^ = oo for every compact Q C R^). 
Then: 
1. If n < 3, the previous proposition is still valid. One can prove 
it using a similar method as in the proof of Proposition 2.5 . 
2. If n > 4, the previous proposition is still valid (the Sobolev 
theorem impUcitly used in the proof of Proposition 2.5 cannot be 
used here anymore). This can be proved using the boimdedness of 
the fractional operator I^u := {—A)^^'^Uy when 
a. la : 1/2 (R^) h-> BMO(R^) 
and 
b. la : I/^(R^) »-> LP{W), where 1/q = 1/p - a/n with 1/p > 
a/n. 
Now, to overcome this difficulty, we will use the so-called 
"method of invariant spaces" introduced in [30]. 
But first, we will recall some preliminary facts: 

2.1 Linear Equations 
49 
Let 5 C if be a closed subset and Ps, the orthogonal projection 
onto the subspace S. The operator is still a densely defined closed 
(possibly imboiinded) linear operator in H, 
Definition 2.6* S is said to be an invariant subspace for A if we 
have the inclusion A{D{A) DS) G S. 
Example 2.7. Let us mention the following classical invariant sub-
spaces for the closed imbounded linear operator A defined into the 
Hilbert space H, 
1. 5 == N{A) = {x € D{A) : Ax = 0} is an invariant subspace 
for A. 
2. If i4 is a self-adjoint linear operator, then any eigenspace 
Sx = N(XI — >l) is an invariant for A. In iact it can be easily 
shown that 5A reduces A. 
Theorem 2.8. The equality PsAPs = APs is a necessary and 
sufficient condition for a subspace S to be invariant for a linear 
operator A. 
Proof Assume PsAPs = APs and if x € D{A) n 5, then x = 
Psx e D{A) and Ax = APsx = PsAPsx e S. 
Conversely, if 5 is invariant for A; letx £ H be such that Psx € 
D(A). Then APsx € 5 and then PsAPsX = APsx. Therefore 
APs C PsAPs. Since D{APs) = D{PsAPs), 
it turns out that 
APs = PsAPs. 
Definition 2.9* A closed proper subspace S of the Hilbert space 
H is said to reduce an operator A if PsD{A) C D{A) and both S 
and H Q S, the orthogonal complement of S, are invariant for A. 

50 
2 Almost Automorphic Evolution Equations 
Using the above Theorem 2.8, the following key result can be 
proved. 
Theorem 2.10. A closed subspace S of H reduces an operator A 
if and only if PsA C APs-
Proof See the proof in [59] Theorem 4.1L, p. 29. 
Remark 2.11. In fact the meaning of the inclusion PsA C APs is 
that: if a: e D{A) , then Psx e D{A) and PsAx = APsx . 
Recall that their algebraic sum of A and B is defined by 
D{A + B) = D{A) n D{B) and {A + B)u = Au + Bu, 
VueD(A)nD(B). 
We assume that D{A) n D{B) = H and the operators A and 
B are infinitesimal generators of Co-groups of boimded linear op-
erators {T{t))ten, (i?(t))t€Rj respectively, such that 
(i) T{t)x : t H-> T{t)x 
is almost automorphic for each x e H, 
R{t)y : t !->  R{t)y 
is almost automorphic for each y E H, 
respectively; 
(ii) there exists 5 C if, a closed subspace that reduces>l and B. 
We denote by P5, Q^ = (J - Ps) = PHQS^ the orthogonal 
projections onto S and H Q S, respectively; 
(iii) R{A) C R{Ps) = NiQsY, 
(iv) R{B) C R{Qs) = N{Ps). 
Remark 2.12. (1) Recall that if A, B generate Co-groups, their simi 
A + B need not be a Co-group generator. 

2.1 Linear Equations 
51 
(2) The assumption (ii) above implies that both S and H Q S 
are invariant for the algebraic sum (it is well-defined as stated 
above)>l + B. 
Theorem 2*13. Under assumptions (i)'(ii)-(iii)-(iv), 
every solu-
tion to the differential equation (2,2) is almost automorphic. 
Proof. Let x(s) he a solution to (2.2). Clearly x{s) 6 
D(A)nD{B) 
(notice that the algebraic sum A + B does exist since A + B is 
assumed to be densely defined). 
Now decompose x{s) as follows 
where 
and 
x(s) = Xi(s)+X2is), 
(2.3) 
xi{s) = Psxis) e R{Ps) = N{Qs) 
X2(s) = Qsx(s) e N{Ps) = RiQs^ 
We have 
1(.,W) = P4.W 
= PsAx(s) + PsBx(s) 
= APsx{s) + PsBx{s) 
(according to(ii)) 
= Axi{s) + PsBx{s) 
= ^0:1(5) (according to{iv)). 
Prom —(xi{s)) = Axi{s)y it follows that 
do 
Xiis)=T{s)xx{0). 
(2.4) 

52 
2 Almost Automorphic Evolution Equations 
Now according to (i), the vector-valued function s ^ 
T{s)xi{0) 
is almost automorphic. 
In the same way, since H G {H Q S) = S. It follows that the 
closed subspace S reduces A and B if and only if if 0 5 does. In 
other words, HQS reduces A and B. That is, a similar remark as 
Remark 2.11 holds when S is replaced hy H Q S. Thus, we have 
d-sMs))=Qs-x{s) 
= QsAx{s) + QsBx(s) 
= QsAx{s) + BQsx{s) 
(according to(n)) 
= QsAx{s) + Bx2{s) 
= Bx2 (s) (according to(m)). 
Prom the equation 'T{X2{S)) 
= Bx2{s), it follows that s h-> 
as 
R{s)x2{0) is almost automorphic (according to (i)). 
Therefore x{s) = xi{s) + X2{s) is also almost automorphic as 
the smn of almost automorphic vector-valued ftmctions. 
Corollary 2.14. Let B : H \-^ H be a bounded linear operator 
in the Hilbert space H. Under assumptions (i)-(ii)'(iii)-(iv), 
every 
solution to the equation (2.2) is almost automorphic. 
Proof. This an immediate consequence of the previous Theorem 
2.13 to the case where B is a boimded linear operator, it is straight-
forward.

2* 1.3 Almost Automorphic Solutions to Some 
Second-Order Hyperbolic Equations 
Consider now as in [28], the homogeneous second-order hyperboUc 
differential equation of the form

and the associated nonhomogeneous differential equation 
—n(5) + 25 ^uis) 
+ A u(s) = f(s), 
(2.6) 
where A^ B are densely defined closed linear operators acting in 
a Hilbert space H and / : R »-> i/ is an almost automorphic 
vector-valued function. 
The method of invariant subspaces described in Section 2.1.2 
above can be used to deal with (2.5)-(2.6). For that, the idea is to 
reduce (2.5)-(2.6) into differential equations of first-order. 
Indeed, setting v{s) = -7-1/(5), the problem (2.5)-(2.6) can be 
as 
rewritten in H x H of the form 
^U{s) 
= {A + B)Uis), 
(2.7) 
as 
and 
^U{s) 
= {A + B) U{s) + F{s), 
(2.8) 
as 
where U{s) = {u{s),v{s)), 
F{s) = (0,/(s)) and A^B are the 
operator matrices of the form 
A = I 
and

onHxH 
with D{A) = D{A) x H, D{B) = Hx D(B), and O, / 
denote the zero and identity operators on AT, respectively. 
Since (2.5)-(2.6) is equivalent to (2.7)-(2.8), instead of studying 
(2.5)-(2.6), we will focus on the characterization of almost auto-
morphic solutions to (2.7)-(2.8). 
In this book, we will treat only the homogeneous case (2.7). We 
refer the reader to [28] for the nonhomogeneous case (2.8). 
As in the previous section, we will make the following assump-
tions: 
The operators A and B are infinitesimal generators of Co-groups 
of boimded operators (T(t))aGR) ('^(0)«€RJ respectively, such that

We have 
Theorem 2,15, Under assumptions (i)-(it)'(Hi)'(iv), 
every solu-
tion to the differential equation (2.7) is almost automorphic. 
Proof. Let X{s) be a solution to (2.7). 

2.1 Lineax Equations 
55 
Clearly X{s) e D(A) D D{B) = D(A) x D{B) (observe that 
the algebraic sum A + B exists since D(A + B) = H x H). 
Now decompose X{s) as follows 
X{s) = PsX{s) + {1x1- 
Ps)Xis), 
where PsX{s) 
e R{Ps) = NiQs), and QsX{s) 
€ N{Ps) 
= 
R(Qs). 
We have 
 
=

= PsAXis) + PsBX{s) 
= APsX{s) + PsBX{s) 
(by 
(it)) 
= APsX{s) 
(by 
{w)) 
Prom —(PsX(s)) 
= APsX(5), it follows that 
as 
PsX{s) = r{t)PsXio). 
Now ax^cording to (i), the vector-valued function s H-> PSX{S) 
= 
T{t)PsX{0) 
is ahnost automorphic. 
In the same way, since we have [H x H] Q ([H x H] Q S) = Sy 
then it follows that the closed subspace S reduces A and B if and 
only ii[H X H]eS 
does. 
Hence 
^iQsXis))^Qslxis) 
= 
QsAXis)+QsBX{s) 
= QsAXis)+BQsXis) 
(by

= BQsX{s) 
(by

Prom the equation —(QsX(s)) 
= BQsXis), 
it follows that 
at 
s i-> QsX{s) = 7l{s)QsX{0) is almost automorphic (according to 
(i))-
Therefore X{s) = PsX{s)+QsX{s) 
is also almost automorphic 
as the sum of almost automorphic vector-valued functions. 
Corollary 2.16. Let B : H \-^ H be a bounded linear operator 
in the Hilbert space H. Under assumptions (i)-(ii)'(iii)'(iv). 
Then 
every solution to the equation (2.7) is almost automorphic. 
Proof. This an inmiediate consequence of the Theorem 2.15 to the 
case where B is a, boimded linear operator, it is straightforward. 
2.2 Nonlinear Equations 
2.2.1 Existence of Almost Automorphic Mild 
Solutions-Case I 
We first begin with the following semilinear evolution equation in 
a Banach space (X, ||  ||): 
x\t) = Ax{t) + f{t, x{t)), 
t e R 
(2.9) 
where A is the infinitesimal generator of an exponentially stable 
Co-semigroup (T(t))t>o; that is, there exist K > 0, u < 0 such 
that 
\\T{t)\\ < Ke^', 
for all t>0. 
(2.10) 

2.2 Nonlinear Equations 
57 
We assume that / : M x X »-> X satisfies a Lipschitz condition in 
X uniformly in t, that is, there exists L > 0 such that 
\\f{t,x)-f{t,y)\\<L\\x-y\\ 
for every t € R, x^y e X. 
We wish to estabhsh existence and imiqueness of almost auto-
morphic mild solutions to the equation (2.9). We first prove the 
existence of almost automorphic mild solution of the differential 
equation 
x'{t) = Ax{t) + f{t), 
t e R, 
(2.11) 
where / G AA{X). In fact we have. 
Theorem 2.17. Let f E AA{X) 
and A be the generator of an 
exponentially stable Co-semigroup as above . 
Then equation (2,11) has a unique almost automorphic mild 
solution. 
Proof. We first prove existence of an almost automorhic solution. 
Let 
x{t) = T(t ~ a)x(a) + f T{t - s)f{s)ds, 
for all a G R, t > a, 
J a 
be a mild solution. It remains to prove that x € 
AA{X). 
First, we consider u{t) = /__^ T{t — s)f{s)ds, defined as 
lim / T{t - 
s)f{s)ds. 
Clearly for each r <t, the integral j ^ T(t — s)f(s)ds 
exists. More-

which shows /__^ T{t — s)f{s)ds is absolutely convergent. 
Now let (5^) be an arbitrary sequence of real numbers. Since 
/ € AA{X)^ there exists a subsequence (sn) of (3^) such that 
g{t)— 
lim f{t + Sn) 
n-4+00 
is well-defined for each t G R and 
f{t) = lim g{t - Sn) 
for each 
teR 
Now consider 
/

t 
r ( t + Sn - 
S)f{s)ds 
= f T{t-<T)fn{(T)da, 
where /^(a) = / ( a + Sn), n = 1,2,... 
We also have 
IK* + Sn)\\ < oll/lloo, for all n = 1,2,... 
and by continuity of the semigroup, T(t — a)fn{a) »-> T{t — a)g{cr), 
as n —> 00 for each cr e M fixed and any t> a. 
If we let v{t) = J^^T{t 
— s)g{s)ds, we observe that the in-
tegral is absolutely convergent for each t. So, by the Lebesgue's 
Dominated Convergent Theorem {Theorem i.P), 

2.2 Nonlinear Equations

^(* + Sn) -> v{t)j as n —^ oo 
for each 
teR. 
We can show in a sunilar way that 
^(* — 5n) —^ u(t) as n —^ oo 
for each t G M. This shows that u e 
AA{X). 
Now let u{a) = / ! ^ r(a - 
s)f{s)ds. 
So T(f - a)ix(a) = / ! ^ T{t -

If i > a, then

so that, u{t) = T{t - a)u{a) + jl T{t - s)f{s)ds. If we fix x{a) = 
u{a), then x{t) = u{t), that is a: € 
AA(X). 
We finally prove the uniqueness of the almost automorphic so-
lution. 
Assume x and y are two such solutions and we let z = a: — y. 
Then z € AA{X) and satisfies the equation 
z\t) = Az{t), 
teR. 
Note that z is boimded and satisfies also the equation 
z{t) = T{t - s)z{s) 
for all 5 G K, and t > s 
We also have the inequality 
\\z{t)\\< Ke^'^'-'K

Take a sequence of real numbers (sn) such that Sn —> —oo. For 
any fixed £ € M, we then can find a subsequence (^n^) of (Sn) with 
Snj^ < t for all k = 1,2,.... Usmg the fact that a; < 0, we obtain 
This shows uniqueness of the solution and ends the proof. D 
We now state and prove: 
Theorem 2.18. Assume that f :RxX 
^ X satisfies a Lipschitz 
condition in x uniformly in t, that is, 
\\f{t,x)-f{t,y)\\<L\\x-yl 
for all x,y e X, 
where L < —^. Let also f(t^x) 
be almost automorphic in t for 
K 
each X E X, 
Then equation (2.9) has a unique almost automorphic mild so-
lution. 
Proof. Let x be a mild solution. It is continuous and satisfies the 
integral equation 
x{t) = T{t - a)x{a) + f T{t - s)f{s, x{s))ds, 
Va G R, V t > a. 
Ja 
Consider now / T{t — s)f{s,x{s))ds 
and the nonlinear operator 
G : AA{X) K4 AA{X) given by 
{Gm)-= 
f 
T{t-s)f(s,<l>{s))ds. 
In view of Theorem 2.2.6 in [80], if 0 G AA{X), then f{s, (t>{s)) is 
almost automorphic, thus G(t> G AA{X)^ so that G is well-defined. 
Now for 01, 02 G AA{X), we have:

Gu = u, that is u{t) = f_^ T{t — s)f{s, 
u{s))ds. 
If we let u{a) = / ^ ^ T{a — s)f{s, u{s))ds, then 
T{t - a)u{a) = f 
T{t- s)f{s,

So u{t) = T(t-a)u{a)

of equation (2.9) and u € AA{X). The proof is now complete. D

2.2.2 Existence of Almost Automorphic Mild 
Solutions-Case II 
We still consider equation (2.9) where A is described as above, but 
this time /(t, x) does not satisfy necessarily a Lipschitz condition. 
In fact we wish to consider another class of functions f{t^x) 
as 
described below. 
First, let (Y, |  |) denote a Banach space algebraically contained 
in (X, II  II) such that the canonical injection Y —f X is compact. 
An example of such a space Y is an abstract Sobolev space that 
we construct as follows: 
Let i4 be as above. Then clearly 0 € p{A)^ so that the fractional 
powers (—>l)^, 0 < a < 1, are well defined. Also, since 0 G p{A)^ 
the norm 
i/i = ii(-^r/ii 
(2.12) 
is equivalent to the graph norm 
U = ||(-A)VII + II/||. 
Now we take X = I^(/2), where 1 < p < oo and i? C M^ is a 
smooth boimded domain in R"^. Let A be a linear uniformly elliptic 
operator (with suitable boundary conditions), of order 2m. Then 
let Y be the domain of {—A)^ with norm (2.12); we have 
Wo^^"^^(/2) C Y C W^2^^'^(I2) 
and the norm |  | in Y is equivalent to the usual norm in W'^'^^'^{Q). 
Also, the injection Y ~> X is compact in this case, by Sobolev 
embedding. 

2.2 Nonlinear Equations 
63 
Now let Y = D{{-A)°), 
the domain of {-A)°',with 
norm 
\y\ = \\i-Aryl 
yeD{i-Ar), 
where 0 < a < 1 is fixed. We get 
\T{t)y\ = \\Tit){-Ary\\ 
< 
Ke-'^\[(-Ary\\, 
and since 
Ke-'^'\\i-Ary\\ = Ke-'^\yl 
we obtain 
\T{t)y\ < Ke-'^\y\ 
(2.13) 
for each j / € Y and every t>0,hy 
(2.10). 
We also make the following assiunptions: 
F{t,x) = P{t)Q{x), 
far all 
teR,xe 
X, 
(2.14) 
where P{t) e AA(Z) for each t e R with Z = 5(X,Y); P is 
continuous from R to AA(Z), and Q : BC(R,X) -^ BC{R,X) 
is 
continuous and satisfies the estimate 
\\Q<p\\oo < MiMoo), 
(2.15) 
where ||/||oo := supfgR ||/(t)|| and X G C(R+,R+) satisfies 
lim : ^ ^ = 0.

Define G : BC(R,X) ->  BC(R, Y) by 
(G<fi){t)= f 
T{t-s)F{s,(p{s))ds. 
(2.18) 
For (f € -BC(R,X), this integral exists. Indeed, we have 
\(Gcp){t)\< f

\G<p\oo = sap \iG<p){t)\

(2.19) 
Continuity of G is straightforward in virtue of continuity of both 
P and Q. Thus we have 
G(BC7(R,X))cBC(R,Y). 
Finally, for 0 < <5 < 1, let 
5C*(R,Y) = {fe 
BC{R,Y) : \f\s,Y < oo}, 
where

Proposition 2.19. The function G defined above maps bounded 
sets ofBC{R,X) 
into bounded sets of BC\R,Y) 
for any S > 0 
satisfying S < a, where 0 < a < 1 is the exponent defining Y = 
Proof. The proof is basically a modification of the above remarks.

Now, by Proposition 1.19, there exists a constant Ki such that 
\\T(r)(-An < ^ ^ 
for all r > 0. Thus we obtain, as previously, 
\T{r){-Af\ 
< Kie-'^r-^, 
r > 0. 
(2.21) 
Next, we observe that the function s

formly bounded function R -> B(X, D{{-AY-^). 
Indeed, it is the 
composition of P(-) : R -^ B(X, D{{-AY)) 
which is bounded by 
[P], with i-A)-^, 
an isometry from D{{-AY)

Thus

Proposition 2.21. The canonical injection id : BC^{R,Y)

B<7(R, X) is compact, which implies that 
id : BC\R, Y) n AA{X) -^ AA(K)

To this end, let (ipi,) be a boimded sequence in J3C^(R, Y). 
Let Q = {rn} be the set of all rational nimibers. Then {(piyivn))

By the well known Cantor diagonalization process, there exists 
a subsequence (^uf^) such that

But the sequence {(pn) is an equicontinuous family of functions

in X, for alH € M. 
In addition the convergence is uniform in t e M. 
Note that BUC{R, X) can be identified with C(r, X) for a suit-
able Hausdorff compactification T of R (see for instance [33]). 
Thus the convergence (p„^ -^ <p holds in BC/C(M, X) C SC(R, X) 
This completes the proof. D 
Proposition 2.22. The function G has a fixed point in AA{X). 
Proof. Let us recall that the estimates (2.22)-(2.23), 
and 
\iG<p){t2) - {G<pit,)\<C,\t2 - 
ti\6M{M\oo), 
hold for all ¥? € BC(R,Y) and all ti,t2 € R with t2 not equal to

It follows that there exists a constant Ce = C6(u},K,Ki^a, /?, 7) 
such that 
(p e BC{R,X) 
and 
\\ip\\oo < R implies 
Gip e BC\R,Y) 
and \G(p\ < Ri, 
where Ri = CeM{R).

Since M(R)/R 
-^ 0 as R^

some constant C7 and all y 6 Y, it follows that there exists p> 0 
such that for all i2 > p, we have 
G{BAA(X)(0,

(2.25) 
Since G leaves i4A(X) C J5C(R, X) invariant, the estimate (2.25) 
along with the continuity properties of G imply that G is a con-
tinuous, compact mapping S -^ S^ where S is the ball of radius R 
in AA{X) and 
R>p. 
By the Schauder fixed point theorem G has a fixed point in 5, 
Obviously, ^0 is ^ ii^ild solution of (2.9). 
Finally, the above results can be summarized as follows. 
Theorem 2.23. Consider the evolution equation (2.9) where A 
generates an exponentially stable Co-semigroup T in B{X). As-
sume assumptions (2.10) and (2.14)-(2.17). 
Then (2.9) has a mild solution in i4A(X).

2.3 Optimal weak-almost periodic solutions 
In this section we still consider equation (2.1) in a imiformly con-
vex Banach space (X, ||  ||). We will prove existence and uniqueness

of the so-called "optimal" almost periodic solutions in the weak 
sense, a result contained in [77]. 
We make the following assumptions: 
Al: A: D{A) C X »-> X is a linear operator (generally imbounded) 
that generates a Co-semigroup of uniformly bounded linear 
operators T{t), t e R"*"., i.e. there exists M > 0 such that 
s^Pt€M+ ll^(*)ll = M' For each T(t), t € R+, T*{t) will denote 
the adjoint operator of T{t). 
A2: / : E H-> X is a nontrivial strongly continuous function. 
Now we denote by i?/, the set of all mild solutions x(t) of 
equation (2.1) which are bounded over R, that is 
//(x) = sup ||x(<)|| < oo. 
We assume here that 1?/ ^ 0. 
Definition 2.24. A bounded mild solution x{t) of (2.1) will be 
called an optimal mild solution of (2.1) if 
/x(x) = /i* = inf /i(x). 
x£Qf 
Theorem 2.25. Under assumptions A1-A2 and assuming that 
Qf ^ 0, equation (2.1) has a unique optimal mild solution. 
The proof is based on the following well-known fact (cf. [55], Corol-
lary 8.2.1) 
Lemma 2.26. If K is a non-empty convex and closed subset of a 
uniformly convex Banach space X and v ^ K, then there exists a 
unique ko G K such that \\v — ko\\ = i^keK \\v — ^||-

2,3 Optimal weak-almost periodic solutions 
75 
Now we begin the proof of the theorem: 
Proof. Since the trivial solution 0 ^ i?/, it suffices to prove that 
i7/ is a convex and closed set; we then use Lemma 2.26 to deduce 
uniqueness of the optimal mild solution to equation (2,1). Let us 
first obtain convexity of Qf. 
Consider two distinct boimded mild solutions Xi{t) and X2{t), 
and a real number 0 < A < 1 and let x{t) = Axi(t) + (1 — A)x2(t), 
t G R. x{t) is continuous and has the integral representation 
x{t) = T{t - io)a:(to) + f T{t- 
s)f{s)ds 
Jto 
for every to ER and t>to. 
Here we have 
x{to) = Axi(to) + (1 - A)x2(to). 
x{t) is then a mild solution of equation (2.1). It is easy to see that 
x{t) is bounded over R since 
fi{x) = snp\\x(t)\\ < A/i(j;i) + (1 — \)fi{x2) < oo. 
We conclude that x{t) € i?/. 
Let us now show that i?/ is closed: 
Consider a sequence (xn) in ]?/ such that limn->oo^n(*) = ^(*)? 
t G R. We have for all to 6 R and t > to : 
Xn{t) = T{t ~ to)Xnito)

T{t ^

Jto 
n = 1,2,... 
For every fixed t and to with t>tQ,we 
have 

76

liinn->oo T{t - to)Xn{to) = T{t - to) linin-^oo Xn{to) 
= T{t - to)x(to) 
using contintdty of the operator T(t — to). We then deduce that 
x{t) = T{t - to)x{to) + f T{t- 
s)f{s)ds 
Jto 
for all to € R, t > to. This shows that x{t) is a mild solution of 
(2.1). 
Finally we claim that x{t) is bounded over R. Indeed, let us 
write x{t) as follows: 
X{t) = T(t - to)x{to) 
+ fl T{t - S)f{s)ds 
- Xn{t) + Xn{t) 
= T{t -- to){x{to)

<M||x(to)-a:n(to)||+/i(xn). 
Choose n large enough such that ||x(<o) — 2:n(to)|| ^ 1- Then we 
have 
/i(x) < M + /i(a:n) < CO. 
We have just proved that a: € i?/, which completes the proof of 
the theorem. D 
Theorem 2.27. Let f e AP{X) and assume that Al and A2 hold 
true. 
Then the optimal mild solution of equation (2.1) is weakly al-
most periodic. 

2.3 Optimal weak-almost periodic solutions 
77 
Proof. Consider x{t) the optimal mild solution of equation (2.1). 
Such x{t) is unique by the previous Theorem. We have 
x{t) = T{t - to)x{to) + f T{t- 
x)f{s)ds 
Jto 
for all to ^ K, f > to- Let {s'^) be an arbitrary sequence of real 
numbers. Since / is almost periodic, we can extract a subsequence 
(sn) C {s'^) such that 
lim /(t + Sn) = 9{t) 
imiformly in t € M. This fact is assured by Bochner's Criterion. 
We know g(t) is also strongly continuous. Now, for fixed to € M, 
we can obtain a subsequence of (5^), which again we will denote 
(5n), such that 
w - lim x(to + Sn) = 
vo^X, 
n->oo 
since X is a reflexive Banach space. The function 
2/(t) = T(t - to)i;o + f Tit-- 
s)g{s)ds 
Jto 
is then strongly continuous. It is a mild solution of 
x\t)=Ax{t)-tg{t), 
teM. 
We can prove. 
Lemma 2

n = 1,2, 
Take x* in X* and let

for every n = 1,2,..., from which we observe that the sequence 
{T{t — to)x{to + Sn)) converges to T{t — to)vo in the weak sense. 
Also we have the following inequalities 
f T{t - s)f{s + Sn)ds - f T{t-

in the strong sense and consequently in the weak sense in X. This 
proves the Lemma D 
We also have: 
Lemma 2.29* fi{y) = ^{x) = /x* 

2.3 Optimal weak-almost periodic solutions 
79 
Proof, Since x{t) is an optimal mild solution of equation (2.1), we 
have 
/i*=/i(a:) = sup||a:(i)||. 
Take an arbitrary x* in X*\ then by Lemma 2,28 we obtain 
lim < X*, x(t + Sn) >=< X*, y(t) > 
for every < e R. Now for each n = 1,2,..., we have 
\<x\x{t

Therefore, | < x*yy{t) > \ < \\x*\\fjL*, for every t G M, and conse-

Suppose that fji{y) < //*. Plemark that limn--^oop(* — ^n) = /(*) 
uniformly in i G M since / G AP{X). Also since X is a reflexive 
Banach space, we can extract from the sequence (5^), a subse-
quence which we still denote (sn) such that (y{to — Sn)) is weakly 
convergent, say to z G A'. Now we have

It is a bounded mild solution of equation (2.1). For the same rea-
sons stated above, we have 
fJ'iz) < /i(t/), 
therefore /i(z) < /i*, which is absurd by definition of //*.

We also need the following: 
Lemma 2.30* 
/i(j/) = mf fiiv) 
i.e. y(i) is an optimal mild solution of the equation 
x'(t) = Ax(t)+g(t), 
teR. 
Proof. By Lemma 2.29^ y(t) is bounded over R. We know also that 
y{t) is a mild solution of x'{t) = Ax{t) +g{t), teR. 
So y{t) € Og. 
It remains to prove that y{t) is optimal. 
Suppose it is not. Since fig ^ 0, there exists a unique optimal 
solution v(t) of 
x\t) = Ax{t) + g{t) 
by Theorem 2.25. And ti{v) < fi{y) and 
v(t) = T{t - to)v{to) + f T{t-

for alHo e R, i > to-
We can find a subsequence {snf,) C {sn) such that 
weak - limjb^oo v{t - Sn^) = T{t - £o)^ + £ T{t - 
s)f{s)ds 
:= V{t) 
Observe that V{t) € i?/ and 
f^{V) < tx{v) < fx{y) 
which is absurd. 
Therefore y(t) is an optimal mild solution of 
x\t) =Ax{t)+g{t), 
teR, 
and in fact the only one by Theorem 2.25. D 

2.3 Optimal weak-almost periodic solutions 
81 
Proof of Theorem 2.27(coiitinued): To show that x(t) is weakly 
almost periodic, it suffices to prove now that 
weak — lim x{t + Sn) = y{t) 
n—¥oo 
miiformly in t e R. 
Suppose that it is not the case; then there exists x* € X* such 
that 
lim < x*,j:(i + 5n) > = < x*,y(t) > 
n->oo 
is not uniform in t € M. Consequently, we can find a number a > 0, 
a sequence (tk) with two subsequences (5]^) and (sk^) of {sn) such 
that 
\<x\x{t 
+ 4 ) - x{t + 5fc") >\>a 
(2.26) 
for all A:= 1,2,... 
Let us again extract two subsequences of (5^) and (s!^) respec-
tively, without changing the notation, such that 
\mif{t 
+ tk + 
4)=gi{t) 
and 
limf{t 
+ tk + 
4)=g2{t) 
both uniformly in i G M, since / € AP{X), As we did previously, 
we may obtain 
weak- lim /(t+tfc+4) = T{t-to)zi+

for each t e R, where y\{t) and y2{t) are optimal mild solutions in 
Qg^ and Qg^^ respectively. 
Now we can show that 5^1(5) = g2{s)^ s E R; indeed since 
lmiA;-^oo/(* + *A; + ^A:) exists Uniformly in i € M and (5J^), {s'l^) 
are two subsequences of {sk)^ we will get 
sup||/(5 + 4)-/(5 + 4')ll<e 
if A; > A:o(^) and consequently 
sup ||/(t + tife + 4) - f{t +1^ + 4011 < ^ 
for k > koie)^ which shows that gi(s) = 52(^) for all 5 G M. By 
the imiqueness of the optimal mild solution we get yi{t) = 2/2(0? 
t e E. But 
yi{0) = weak - lim x{tk + 4 ) 
and 
^2(0) = weak - lim x{tk + 4)-
It is then clear that the equality yi{0) = 2/2(0) contradicts the 
inequality (2,24) above and establishes the proof of the Theorem.

2.4 Existence of Weakly Almost Automorphic 
Solutions 
We give in this section a result on the existence of a weakly almost 
automorphic solution to the equation (2.1), It is a slightly different 
version of a result in [101]. 

2.4 Existence of WeaMy Almost Automorphic Solutions 
83 
Theorem 2,31. Let {X, \\  ||) be a reflexive, separable Banach 
space, and assume that A is the infinitesimal generator of a Co-
semigroup {T{t))t>0' Let X* be the dual space of X and T*{t) € 
L{X*) the adjoint operator ofT{t), for each t >0 with the property 
that 
lim T*(t)(p = 0 for every 
(p e X* 
t 
>'O0 
in the uniform operator topology. Assume also that f is weakly 
almost automorphic. 
Then every bounded mild solution of (2.1) is weakly almost au-
tomorphic. 
We first state and prove the following: 
Lemma 2.32. Under assumptions of the theorem, we claim that 
the functions T{t — s)f{s), T{t — s)g{s) : [a, t] ^-^ X are strongly 
measurable and \\T{t — 5)7(5) ||, \\T{t — 5)5'(5)|| are Lebesgue inte-
grable. 
Proof. By strong continuity of T{t—s) and weak continuity of f{s), 
it is clear that T{t — s)f{s) is weakly continuous, thus strongly 
measurable. 
Moreover the set B = {T{t — s)f{s)/ 
s G [a, t]} is contained in 
the least closed subspace spanned by the set 
{T{t-s)f{s)/seQf)[a,t]} 
(Q denotes the set of rational numbers). 
Hence {T{t — s)f{s)/ s G [a,t]} is separable. 

84 
2 Almost Automorphic Evolution Equations 
Also note that T{t — s)g{s) is weakly measurable as pointwise 
limit of the following sequence of strongly measurable functions 
T{t-S)f{s 
+ Sn). 
And since the Banach space X is assumed to be separable, 
strong and weak measurabilty are equivalent. Measurabilty of both 
numerical functions \\T{t — s)f{s)\\ and \\T{t — s)g{s)\\ is also easy 
to establish. 
As a result of the lemma, the functions 
T(t - s)f{s), T{t - s)g{s) : [a, 
t]^X 
are integrable in Bochner's sense. 
We are now ready to prove the theorem. 
Proof. Let x{t) = T(t-a)x(a)+/JT{t-s)f{s)ds 
t>aheamild 
solution of the equation (2.1) such that 5ixpt€R||^(*)ll = Af < oo. 
Given an arbitrary sequence of real numbers (5^), consider the 
functions Xn{t) defined by 
Xn{t) := x(t + s^) 
teR. 
Since for each t € R, the sequence {Xn{t)) is bounded, there exists 
a subsequence {sn,o) of (s^) such that 
w - lim Xn,o(0) =W'- 
lim x{sn,o) = yo 
exists in X by Proposition 1.2.18 in [80]. Prom the sequence (5^,0), 
we can extract a subseqence (5^,1) such that 
w — lim a:n,i(-l) = i/; — lim x(—1 + Sn,i) = 2/1 

2.4 Existence of Weakly Almost Automorphic Solutions

exists in X. We continue the process inductively and we take the 
diagonal sequence (sn) to obtain 
w - lim xJ-N) 
= w- 
lim xl-N + Sn) =yNj 
^ = 0,1,2,... 
Now using weak almost automorphy of the function / , we can find 
a subsequence of (sn) which denote again by (s^) such that 
w- 
hm x{-N+ 
Sn) = yNi iV = 0,1,2,... 
ty - lim f{t + Sn) = git) for each 
teR 
w — lim g(t — Sn) = fit) 
for each i € R. 
rn-¥oo 
We now need to prove that 
w — lim xCt + Sn) exists for each i G M. 
Fix teR 
and choose N such that —A^ < t. Then it is 
X{t + Sn) = T{t + N)x{-N 
+ Sn)+ I 
T{t - S)f{s + Sn)ds. 
J-N 
Take an arbitrary <p E X*. Then using the duality
) between 
X and X*, we get 
(</P, / 
T{t ~ 5)/(5 + Sn) ~ 5(5)d5) = 
/ 
{T''{t-s)^J{s 
+ Sn)-g{s))ds. 
J-N 
Now we put 
Fn{s)=^{<P,T(t--s)f{s 
+ Sn)-9is)), 
Tl = 1,2, ... 

86 
2 Almost Automorphic Evolution Equations 
Prom the lemma above it follows immediately that {Fn(s)) is a 
sequence of measurable fimctions defined on the compact interval 
[—iV,t]. Moreover we have the inequality 
\Fn{s)\<M\\T{t-sm\\f(s 
+ Sn) + 
Since ||T(i)|| < Ke^^ for every t > 0, the bound \\T{t - s)\\ < L 
holds true on [—N^t] for some 0 < L < oo. Note also that both 
f{t) and g{t) are bounded (cf Proposition 1.32). 
Hence {Fn{s)) is a boimded sequence of measurable functions 
on [—iV, t]. Also it is clear that w — limnH^oo F{s) = 0 everywhere 
on [—N,t]; thus 
lim / 
F{s)ds = Oy 
that is 
tt; ~ lim / 
T{t - s)f{s + Sn)ds = / 
T(f - s)g{s)ds. 
We infer that w — liinn»->oo ^(t + Sn) = y{t) where 
y{t) = T{t + N)y{-N) 
+ f 
T{t^ 
s)g{s)ds. 
J-N 
Now take any pair of real numbers a, t such that t> a and choose 
a positive integer N such that —N<a<t. 
Then we get 
y{t) = T{t - a)y{a) + f T{t - 
s)gis)ds. 
J a 
We have also 
\\y{t)\\ < liminf \\x{t + Sn)\\ < M for every t G R. 
Hence

sup 11^(011 <M. 
Repeating the argument that we used to show the existence oiw — 
Um^H-xx) 00{t + 5n), we can show that there exists a subsequence of 
(Sn) which we still designate by (sn) such that w—limn^oo vit — Sn) 
exists for every t ER. 
Call z(t) this limit, then we have 
z{t) = Tit - a)z(a) + / T(t - 
s)f{s)ds, 
J a 
with 
sup|Ki)||<sup||2/(£)||<M. 
Finally let us show that z{t) = x(t) for every 
teR.We&xteR 
and choose arbitrary e > 0 and (p e X*. We have 
\{<p, z{t) - x{t))\ = \{<p, T(t -- a)z{a) - x(a))\ 
= |(T*(t - a)^,z{a) - x{a))\ < 2M||r*(t ~ a)^\\ 
Since s — lininH->oo^*(*)v^ = 0 for every ^ G A'*, we can choose a 
negative number a sufficiently large so that ||T'*(t — a)y?|| < -^^ 
which gives 
|(V?, z{t) - a;(t))| = 0 for every ^ G X*, 
that means 
2:(t) = x{t) for each t € R. 
The proof is now established. D

Bibliographical Remarks and Open Problems 
Among important results in this chapter, we like to mention 
N'Guerekata's contribution (Theorem 2.1) and the so-called method 
of reduction (Theorem 2.4) also refered as a result of Bohr-
Neugebauer type which has various generalizations for instance in 
[62], and other cases in [76] where the use of a method of decom-
position of the space has been successful. In perturbed equations 
of the form 
x\t) = (A + B)x{t) 
and its purtiu:bation 
x\t)^{A 
+ B)x{t) + f{t), 
where both operators A and B are unboimded, the use of the 
invariant subspaces theory in [31] has successfully produced almost 
automorphy of solutions. Theorem 2.15 is contanied in [28]. 
For nonlinear equations, a partial result on the existence and 
the imiqueness of almost automorphic solutions was obtained in 
Theorem 2.17 (see also [75]) when A generates an exponentially 
stable semigroup. Its variant, Theorem 2.23, is a contribution by J. 
A. Goldstein and G.M. N'Guerekata (see [46]).This result is new, 
even for the almost periodic case. 
Another important result is contained in [32], in the case of 
holomorphic semigroup, using the method of sums of conmaut-
ing operators. The same paper introduces the notion of imiform 
spectrum of the the forced term /. The ultimate aim of this pio-
neering work is to compare the spectrum of / and the solution's

one as in almost periodic case. This work has generated several 
other papers, and the method introduced there can be applied to 
higher order evolution equations (see for instance [58]). It is also of 
great interest to study linear inhomogeneous evolution equations 
of the for x' = Ax + f where the operator A generates instead a 
C-semigroup. 
For linear functional differential equations, Y. Hino and S. Mu-
rakami studied the existence of almost aimorphic solutions in their 
interesting paper [50]. One might obtain an easier proof of their 
results using the methods presented in this chapter. 
Theorem 2.35 is SL variant of Theorem 6.1.3 in [80]. 

Almost Periodicity in Fuzzy Setting 
In this chapter, the theory of ahnost periodicity as known in Ba-
nach spaces (see for instance [2], [23], [80]), is studied in fuzzy 
setting. It is based on a work by B. Bede and S. G. Gal [40]. 
We start with a brief overview of basic properties of the so-called 
fuzzy sets in Section 3.L Then we introduce the notion of almost 
periodic fuzzy functions in Section 3.2, and study their harmonics 
in Section 3.3. Integration and differentiability of fuzzy functions 
are also introduced. Finally we apply the results obtained to fuzzy 
differential equations in Section 3.4. 
3.1 Fuzzy Sets 
Definition 3.1, Given a set X ^ 0, a fuzzy subset of X is a 
mapping it: X -> [0,1] and obviously any classical subset A of X 
can be considered as a fuzzy subset of X defined by XA * X -^ [0,1], 
XA {X) = 
l,ifxeA,XA{x)=OifxeX\A. 

96 
3 Almost Periodicity in Fuzzy Setting 
Definition 3.2. Let us denote by R^ the class of fuzzy subsets 
of the real axis E (^ie. r/ : R -4 [0,1]^, satisfying the following 
properties: 
(i)^u G R^, u is normal i.e. 3xu € R with u {xu) = 1; 
{ii)\/u € R^, u is convex fuzzy set, i.e. 
u{tx + {l-t)y) 
> min{u(x) 
,u(y)}, 
Vt€[0,l],a:,y€R; 
(Hi) VIA 6 R^, u is upper semi-continuous on R; 
(iv) {x eR: 
u{x) > 0} is compact. 
Then R^ is called the space of fuzzy real numbers. 
Remark 3.3. It is clear that R C R^, because any real number 
Xo € R, can be described as the fuzzy number whose value is 1 for 
x = xo and 0 otherwise. 
We will collect some other definitions and notations needed in the 
sequel. For 0 < r < 1 and u e Rjr, we define 
[uY :={ar€R;n(a:) > r} 
[uf := {xeR\u{x) 
>0}. 
Now it is well known that for each r € [0,1], [ix]^ is a boimded 
closed interval. For ix,v G R^ and A € R, we have the sum u®v 
and the product A © tx defined by 
[u®vY = [uX + [vY , [X(duY = \[uY, 
Vr€[0,l], 

3.1 Fuzzy Sets 
97 
where [uY + [vY means the usual addition of two intervals (as 
subsets of M) and A [uY means the usual product between a scalar 
and a subset of R. (see e.g. [20]) 
Now we define D :Rjr xRj:-^R^U 
{0} by 
D (u, v) = sup max {|t/!l — t;l |, |Ti!j_ — i;!j. |} , 
r€[0,l] 
where [i/f = [n!l,tx!i.], [vY = [^->^!I-]-
We also have the following well-known properties ([20]): 
(a) D{u®w,v®w) 
= D(iz,v), \fu,v,w e Rjr; 
(b) D{kQu,kQv)== 
\k\D{u,v), 
Vu.v eRj^^k 
eR] 
(c) D(u®v,w®e) 
< D{u,w) + D{v,e) ,^u,v,w,e 
€ R^ and 
(R^, D) is a complete metric space. 
Also, the following is known: 
Theorem 3.4. (i) If we denote 6 = X{o} then 0 e R^ is neutral 
element with respect to ®, i.e. u^O = 0®u = u, for allu € R^. 
(ii) With respect to 0, none ofu£ 
R ^ \ R has opposite in R^ (with 
respect to ^). 
(Hi) For any a, 6 € R with a, 6 > 0 or a, 6 < 0^ and any u G R^, we 
have 
{a + h)Qu = 
aQu®hQ)u. 
For general a, 6 G R, the above property does not hold, 
(iv) For any A € R and any u^v E R^, we have 
X(Z){U®V) 
= 
XQU®XQIV. 

98 
3 Almost Periodicity in Fuzzy Setting 
(v) For any A, /x € R and any u 6 M^; we have 
(vi) If we denote \\u\\jr = D(u,0), 
"iu 6 R^, then ||-||^ has the 
properties of a usual norm on R^, i.e. \\u\\j: = 0 if and only if 
u = 0, IIA 0 u\\jr = |A|  llt^ll-^ and 
\\u e t;||^ < ||n||^ + ||t;||^, 
I jjujl^ - ||t;||^| < D (u, v). 
Remark 3.5. The properties (ii) and (iii) in Theorem 3.4 show us 
that (R^,®,0) is not a Hneax space over R and consequently 
(R^, IHJ^) cannot be a normed space. However, the properties of 
D and those in Theorem 3.4^ (iv)-(vi), have as an effect that most 
of the metric properties of a ftmction defined on R with values in 
a Banach space, can be extended to functions / : R ^ R^, called 
fuzzy functions. 
3.2 Almost Periodicity in Fuzzy Setting 
In this section , we present a fuzzy version of the theory of almost 
periodic functions as known in Banach spaces (see for instance [2], 
[23]), or Prechet spaces (see [80]). 
Definition 3.6. A generalized fuzzy trigonometric polynomial of 
degree <n is defined as a finite sum of the form ^ * Tk {x) 0 Ck, 
where Ck € R^ and Tk (x) are usual trigonometric polynomials of 
degree <n i.e. 
Tk{x) = X ] [ a f cosjx + hf smjxl 
af\hf 
e R. 

3.2 Almost Periodicity in Fuzzy Setting 
99 
Here, the polynomials Tf^ (x), are not necessarily supposed to be 
linearly independent on R and ^ * denotes addition (sum) with 
respect to ® in R^. 
Note that the usual fuzzy trigonometric polynomials could nat-
urally be defined of the form 
* 
/^^[dj 0 cos jx ® bj 0 sin jar], 
with ajybj € R, which because of the lack of distributivity of 0 
with respect to ©, obviously are only particular cases of the above 
concept of generalized fuzzy trigonometric pol3aiomials. But, as 
it was pointed out in e.g. [3], the suitable fuzzy polynomials in 
approximation are of generalized type and not of usual type. 
We also recall the following definition. 
Definition 3.7. / : R -> R^ is said to be continuous at XQ € R if: 
\/e > 0,36 > 0 such that D (/ (x), / (XQ)) < e, whenever x e R, 
|x — xo| < S. 
Definition 3.8. Let / : R -^ R^ be continuous on R. 
(i) We say that / is B-almost periodic if : Ve > 0, 3 Z > 0 such 
that any interval of the form [a, a+1] contains at least a point 
T with 
DU{t + 
r)J{t))<e,^teR. 
(ii) We say that / is normal if for any sequence Fn : R —>" R^ of the 
form Fn {x) = f {x + hn), n eN, where {hn)^ is a sequence of 
real nmnbers, one can extract a subsequence of (Fn)^, converg-
ing uniformly on R (i.e. V {hn)^, 3 (hn,), 3F : R -> Rjr (which 

100 
3 Almost Periodicity in Fuzzy Setting 
may depend on {hn)^), such that D{Fn^ (x) ,F(x)) -> 0, as 
k —^ oo, uniformly with respect to x € M) 
(iii) We say that / has the approximation property, if Ve > 0, 
exists some generalized fuzzy trigonometric polynomial T with 
D{f{x),T{x)) 
<£, VxeR. 
Remark 3.9. We observe that Definition 3.8 i) is compatible with 
Definition 3.1.1 [80]. 
Also property ii) in Definition 3.8 is the so-called Bochner^s 
criterion {Theorem 1.61). 
Let us denote AP (Rjr) = {/ : R -> R^; / 
is B-almost periodic}. 
We will show in the next two theorems that AP (R^) is a subclass 
of uniformly continuous boimded functions. 
Theorem 3.10, / / / : R —> Rjr is (continuous) B-almost periodic 
then f is bounded (i.e. 3M > 0 with D{f(x),f{y)) 
< M, Vx,j/ € 
R;. 
Proof. We follow the proof in [23, Theorem 6.1, p.l54]. Because 
D{f(x)J{y))<D{f{x)ro)+D{OJ{y)) 
= \\fix)\\^M\^ 
it is sufficient to prove that 3Mi > 0 with ||/ (x)||^ < Mi. 
Let £ = 1 and / (1) be as in Definition 3.8, (i). As in [23, The-
orem 6.1, p.154] it follows 11/ (x)ll^ < Ml, Vx G [0,/ (1)]. 
Now, if t € R is arbitrary, then in [—t, —t + / (1)] there is at 
least a point ^ = ^ (1) in Definition 3.8 i). Hence 
||/(t)||^ = p(/(<),o) = z?(/(Oe/(f + 0,/(< + Oeo)

because t + ^ € [0, / (1)], which proves the theorem. D 
Theorem 3.11. // / : M ~> Mjr is B-almost periodic then f is 
uniformly continuous on R. 
Proof. FoUowmg Theorem 6.2, p. i5^in [23], and in view of the 
properties of Z?, we have 
D if (t2), / (tx)) = D{f (t2) e / (t2 + r ) , / (ti) e / (t2 + r)) 
= D{f (<2) e / (t2 + r ) , / (<2 + r) e / ih))

<D{f(t2)Jit2 
+ T)) + 
D(f(t,)J{h+T)) 
+ D{f(ti+T),f{t2 
+ r))n 
We also have: 
Theorem 3.12. // / : R -^ R^ is B-almost periodic, then A © / 
(AeR), Ffc(x) = f{x^h) 
( x € R ) anrf G(a;) = 
||/(x)||^, 
(ar e R) one B-almost periodic. 
Proof. Because 
D{\Q f {t + i) ,\Q) f {t)) = \\\DU it + i) J (t)), 
for all A 6 R, it easily follows that A © / is B-ahnost periodic. 

102 
3 Almost Periodicity in Fuzzy Setting 
And since 
\\\f(t + 0\\r-\\fm^\<Dif{t 
+ OJit)), 
then it is immediate that G(x) = ||/(a:)||^, a: € M, is B-almost 
periodic (in the usual sense of function G 
:R—^R). 
Let /i G R be fixed and for e > 0, let / > 0 and r attached to / 
in Definition 3.8 i). By 
DU\t 
+ ^)J{t))<e, 
Vt€R, 
we get (by taking 
t=^u-\-h) 
D{f(u + h + ^)J(u + h))<e, 
V<€R, 
which immediately imphes F^ is B-almost periodic. D 
The next result shows that AP (Rjr) is closed with respect to 
uniform convergence on R. 
Theorem 3.13. ///^ : R -> R^, n€:N are B-almost periodic and 
fn -^ f as n -^ oo uniformly on R (i.e. Ve > 0, 3no € N, such 
that 
D{fn{x)J{x))<e, 
Vn>no, Vx G R), 
then f is B-almost periodic. 
Proof. It is similar to the proof of Theorem 3.3 [23], or Theorem 
3.1.4 [80], by taking into accoimt the properties of D in Section 
3.1. U 
Theorem 3.14. The set of values of f : R -> Rjr supposed to 
be B-almost periodic, is relatively compact in the complete metric 
space 
{RT,D). 

3.2 Almost Periodicity in Fuzzy Setting 
103 
Proof. We just follow the Proof of Theorem 3.4 [23], or Theorem 
3.1.5 [80], with in mind the fact that in complete metric spaces, 
the relatively compact sets coincide with precompact sets, it is 
sufficient to show that for any e > 0, the set of values of the 
ftmction can be embedded in a finite ntmiber of spheres of radius 
e. D 
Remark 3.15. Let / : R -> R^ be B-almost periodic and let us 
consider the sequence of values (/ (*n))n€N-
Denote A = {f (tn); n € N} and take the closure A C /(R) C 
RjTy it follows that A is compact, so A is sequentially compact too, 
which by >1 C ^ implies that the sequence (/ (tn))^ has convergent 
subsequence in R^. 
The following result shows that the concepts in Definition 3.8 
i), and (ii), in fact are equivalent. 
Theorem 3.16. A function f : R -¥ Rjr is B-almost periodic if 
and only if it is normal. 
Proof. It is similar to the proof of Theorem 6.6, p. 156 in [23]. 
D 
Also, we have 
Theorem 3.17. The sum ®, of two B-almost periodic functions 
is B-almost periodic. 
Proof. Similar to the proof of Theorem 6.7 m [23]. D 
Theorem 3.18. If f :R^ 
R^ has the approximation property in 
Definition 3.8 (Hi), then f is B-almost periodic. 

104 
3 Almost Periodicity in Fuzzy Setting 
Proof. A function / : R ->  R^ is called 5o-periodic if / (t + SQ) = 
/(t), Vt G R. Obviously a 5o-periodic function is B-almost peri-
odic. 
It follows by Theorem 3.12 and Theorem 3.17 above that any 
generalized fuzzy trigonometric polynomial is B-almost periodic, 
which combined with Theorem 3.13 completes the proof 
D 
Remark 3.19. Let us denote 
AP (R:F) = {/ : R -^ R:r; / is B-abnost periodic} , 
and for / G AP{Rjr), let us define ||/|| = sup{||/(«)||^; t G R}. 
By the proof of Theorem 3.10 we get ||/|| < +oo. Also by Theo-
rem 3.4 and Theorems 3.12, 3.17, {AP (R^), 0 , 0 ) is not a linear 
space, and consequently {AP{Rjr), |H|^) is not a normed space. 
However, endowed with D* : AP (Rj:) x AP (R^) -> R+, where 
D^{f,g)= 
sup 
D{f{t),g{t)), 
AP (R^) becomes a complete metric space. Indeed denoting 
Cb (R^) = {/ : R -^ R^; / is continuous and boimded on R}, 
by standard reasonings (taking into account that (R^, D) is a com-
plete metric space) it follows that (^^(R^), /)*) is a complete met-
ric space. Then, Theorems 3.10 and 3.13 show that AP (R^) is a 
closed subset of Cb (R:F)J i-e. (AP (R^), Z>*) is a complete metric 
space. 
By similar reasonings with those in the proofs of Theorems 6.9 
and 6.10 in [23, p. 158-160], where we define on R^ the metric

m 
Dm{x,y) = 
^D(xi,yi) 
i=l 
for all a: = (xi,..., Xm), and y = {yi^..., t/^) e M^, we can state 
the following compactness criterion. 
Theorem 3.20. The necessary and sufficient condition that a 
family A C AP{Rjr) be relatively compact is that the following 
properties hold true: 
(i) A is equi-continuous; 
(ii) A is equi-almost periodic; 
(Hi) for any t G M^ the set of values of functions from A he relatively 
compact in R^. 
3*3 Harmonics of Almost Periodic Functions in 
Fuzzy Setting 
We start with the concept of integrals of fuzzy functions compat-
ible with the operations introduced in Section 3.1 
Definition 3-21. (see [20]) A function / : [a,b] -> Rjr, [a,b] C R 
is said to be Riemann integrable on [a, 6], if there exists / € M^, 
with the property: Ve > 0, 3<J > 0, such that for any partition of 
[a,6], d : a = Xo < ... < Xn = 6 of mesh u{d) < S, and for any 
points ^i e [xi.Xi^i], 0 < i < n — Ij we have 
where ^ * means sum with respect to ®. 

106 
3 Almost Periodicity in Fuzzy Setting 
In this case we denote 
J a 
In order to introduce Fourier series attached to a given function 
/ € AP (K^), we need the concept of mean value of /, as follows 
Theorem 3.22* For any f € AP(Rjr), 
there exists the mean 
value 
M(/)= lim i © / 
fit)dteR:r, 
where the limit is considered in the metric space (Rjr^D), i.e. 
3M{f)eRjr 
with Jhn^D(M{f),^ef 
f{t)dt)=0. 
Proof. We follow the ideas in the proof of Theorem 6.11 in [23, 
p. 161]. We get

The properties of D allow us to arrive at the inequality (as in

3 Almost Periodicity in Fuzzy Setting 
In what follows we will attach to any function / e AP (Rjr) a 
Fourier series. We start with the following (see for instance [20]). 
Theorem 3.24. R^ can be embedded in M = (7[0,1] x C[Q,1], 
where (7[0,1] is the class of all real valued bounded functions f : 
[0,1] -^ R such that f is left continuous for any x e (0,1], / has 
right limit for any x G [0,1) and f is right continuous at 0. With 
the norm ||-|| = sup^^^ jj \f{x)\, C[Oy 1] is a Banach space. 
Denote \\*\\^ the usual product norm i.e. 
||(/,5)||3 = max{||/||,|M|}. 
Also denote the embedding by j : Rjr -> B, j{u) = (t6_,n_|_). Then 
j(R^) is a closed convex cone in B and j satisfies the following 
properties: 
(i) j{s Q u®t 
Q v) = s ' j{u) + t  j{v) for all u,v £ R^ and 
s^t>0 
(here "-" and ^M-'' denote the scalar multiplication and 
addition in M); 
(a)D{UyV) = \\j(u) — j{v)\\^ (i.e. j embedsRjr inB 
isometrically). 
Remark 3.25. Let us denote Cc[0,l] = {F : [0,1] ^ 
C;F 
= 
Fi +iF2, Fi,F2 e C[0,1]} and Be = Cc[0,1] x Cc[0,l], where 
C represents the set of complex numbers. 
It is obvious that C[0,1] C Cc[0,1], Cc[0,1] is a complex Ba-
nach space endowed with the norm ||/|| = sup {|/ (x)|; x G [0,1]} 
and Be is a complex banach space endowed with the norm 
\\F\\^ = max{|H|,||t;||}, VF = (u,v) e Be = Cc[0,l] x 
^€[0,1]. 

3.3 Harmonics of Almost Periodic Functions in Fuzzy Setting 
111 
It is easy to see that B = (7[0,1] x (7[0,1] C Be can be isometri-
cally embedded into the complex Banach space Be x Be endowed 
with the product norai \\{F,G)\\j^^^^ 
= max {||F||jj^ , HCHu^}, 
where the isometry is defined by 
/ : B -> Be X Be, I[{f,g)] = [(/,^), (0,0)], 
with 0 representing the identical zero function. 
Now for the proof of approximation result, we need the following 
two auxiliary lemmas. 
Lemma 3.26* Let f : R -¥ Rjr be a B-almost periodic function 
and Tra be a positive valued trigonometric polynomial Then T^ © 
/ : R -^ R:F defined by 
{Tm 0 /) {t) = T^ (t) © f(t) for all t € R, 
is B-almost periodic. 
Proof. By Theorem 3.16, it is enough to prove that T^ © / is 
normal. 
Since / is normal, for any sequence of translates {/(t + /in)}n€N 
we have a uniformly convergent subsequence, which we denote 
Since T^ is a real valued trigonometric polynomial, it is also 
normal. It follows that {Tm{t + hk^)}^^^ has a convergent subse-
quence, denoted {f{t + /iz^)}n€N-
Then for n,p € N we have: 
D {{Tm ef){t + hij , (T^ © /) (t + hi^J) 
D{Tmit + hijQf{t 
+ hiJ,Tm{t + hijQf{t 
+ hi^J) 

112 
3 Almost Periodicity in Fuzzy Setting 
D {Tm (t + hj Qf{t 
+ hi„,^) ,T,n(t + hi„,„) efit 
+ hu^„)). 
But it is known (see Lemma 2.2 in [40]) that 
D (a 0 X, 6 © x) = |6 ~ a|  ||x||^, 
for any a, 6 € K of the same sign and x € MF- Then we obtain 
D {(Tm ef){t + hj, (Trn ef){t + hi^J) < 
\Tm {t + hij\ ^D{f{t + hj J{t + hi^J) + 
+ \Tm {t + hi J - Tm {t + hi^J I . 11/ {t + hi^J 11^ , 
which proves the lemma. D 
Let us now define Pi : C[0,l]xC[0,1] -> C[0,l],bypi((/i,/2)) = 
fu « = 1,2, for aU (/i,/z) € C[0,1] x C[0,1]. In what follows, the 
following lemma will be helpful. 
Lemma 3.27. Let / : R ~> Rjr, Then f is B-almost periodic (in 
the sense of Definition 3.8 if and only ifjof:R-^ 
C[0,1] x C[0,1] 
is almost periodic in Bochner's sense (see [23], or [80]), if and only 
ifpioj 
o f iR-^ 
C[Oj 1], i = 1,2 are almost periodic in Bochner^s 
sense. 
Proof. Let us suppose / is almost periodic in the sense of Defini-
tion 3.8 i). It follows: Ve > 0, 3/(6:) > 0 such that any interval of 
length l{e) contains (at least) one point ^ with D(f(t + ^),f(t)) 
< 
e, Vt G R. 

3.3 Harmonics of Almost Periodic Functions in Fuzzy Setting 
113 
Because 
Dif(t+T)j{t)) = Ujof){t+o-uof)mB^ 
we obtain the first equivalence. 
To prove the second equivalence, let us first assume that j o f 
is almost periodic in Bochner's sense. Because 
lia o f)(t + r) - (j o /)(<)||B = max{||(pi ojof)(t 
+ ^ 
-{piojof){t)l 
UP2ojof)(t + 0 
-iP20Jof)it)\\}, 
it easily follows that Pi o j o / : R -> CfO, 1], z = 1,2, are also 
almost periodic in Bochner's sense. 
The converse implication is immediate by the above relation, 
which proves the lemma. D 
The next result called approximation property, is in fact the 
converse of Theorem 3.18, and represents one of the most impor-
tant property of / € AP{R:p). 
Theorem 3.28. Let / : M -> R^ a B-almost periodic function. 
Then there exists a sequence of generalized trigonometric polyno-
mials Tm such that Tm -^ f uniformly on R. 
Proof. Let j o / : R -^ B be the embedding defined in Theorem 
3.24. By Theorem 6.13 [23], the mean values 
ai(A) = M{cos At  j o f{t)} 

114 
3 Almost Periodicity in Fuzzy Setting 
and 
a2iX) = M{smXt ^ j o f{t)} 
exist. Indeed let ji : Rj- -> Be x Be, where ji = / o j with / the 
natural embedding / : B -> Be x Be-
For ji o / we apply again Theorem 6.13 [23] and we obtain that 
a (A) = M{ji o f{t)
 e""*-^*} ^ 0 only for a set at most comitable 
of complex numbers Ai, A2,... 
In what follows we use the ideas in the proof of Theorem 6.15 
[23]. 
Let us consider the Fejer kernel K^ (*) = ^  ~ ^ ^ - I* ^ ^^^1 
known that K^, {t) = YlZ=-n \^^n) 
^^^ ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^^^ trigono-
metric polynomial. Let ^i,...,/?n,-- be a basis of the Fourier 
exponents Ai,...,Ajt,... (i.e. there exist ri,...,rn € Q such that 
A^ = riA + ... + r^PnY Let /C^ (t) = K^r^^ (ff) ...K^r,^ ( ^ ) > 0. 
Observe that Km (*) is also an even trigonometric polynomial. 
Let /Cm  (/ o j o /) : K -> Be X Be. By Lemma 3.27 we obtain 
jofis 
almost periodic and it is easy to see that lojof 
is almost 
periodic too. 
By the proof of Theorem 6.15 [23] we obtain 
1 f^ 
(jm (t) = lim -
K
m {u) {lojo 
f){u + t)du 
T-^00 I Jo 
converges uniformly to 
lojof. 
By the form of the embedding /, it follows that a!^ (t) = 
limT->oo f^ So ^m (^)  (io/) (* + u) du converges uniformly 
tojof. 
Let us consider a^ (t) = M{Km{u) Qf{t + u)} which exists by 
Theorem 3.12 and Lemma 3.26. Then we obtain:

It is easy to see that 
JU^ff

Km (u) Qf{u + t) duj . 
By Theorem 3.2 [20] and since Km is positive it follows:

This leads us to i? [a^ {t) ,/(<)) < f for sufficiently large m and 
any t € M. Observe that a^ (t) is not necessarily a fuzzy trigono-
metric polynomial, since by Theorem 3.4, (iii), for general coef-
ficients, the integral does not necessarily commute with the sum 
related to "e". 

116 
3 Almost Periodicity in Fuzzy Setting 
However a^ (t) is a periodic function (since cr^ (t) is periodic). 
By Theorem 3.1 [3] it follows that there exists a generalized fuzzy 
trigonometric pol3aiomial Pm such that 
PK(t),F^(t))<|. 
Finally we obtain 
D (Pm (t), fit)) < D [Pm (t), a^ {t)) +D{ai 
(t), /(<)) < e. 
Which completes the proof. D 
In conclusion we infer that , Theorems 3.16, 3.18 and 3.28 lead 
to the equivalence of all three concepts in Definition 3.8, in other 
words we have: 
Corollary 3*29« The set of all B-almost periodic fuzzy-number-
valued functions coincides with the set of all continuous normal 
functions and with the set of all functions with approximation 
property. 
3.4 Applications to Fuzzy Differential 
Equations 
We start this section by the illustration of the idea of propagation 
of almost periodicity from the fuzzy input data to the solutions of 
a fuzzy differential equation as follows: 
Theorem 3-30. Let f € i4P(R) that is f is (Bochner) almost 
periodic assume c G R^ is a fuzzy real number. If f{t) > 0, for all 
t eR, 
then the function y : M -)  Rjr given by 

3.4 Applications to Fuzzy Differential Equations 
117 
y{t) = cQ f 
e*-''f{u)du, 
t e R 
(3.1) 
is B-almost periodic and satisfies the fuzzy differential equation 
y\t)®y(t)=cQf{t), 
for all t e Q, where I? = {i € R; f{t) > Jl^ e^-7(n)dn}. 
Here y'{t) is defined as the common value of the following limits 
in the metric D supposed that exist, together with the H-differences 
y{t + h) — y(t), y{t) —y{t — h),h>Q 
(recall that the H-difference 
yit+h)'-y{t) 
exists, if exists a G Rjr such thaty{t+h) 
= 
y{t)®a), 
h\0 
h 
h\0 
h 
(see e.g. Definition 3.3 [20]). 
Proof. Let us denote F{t) = /_^ e""-^ f {u)du, t G R. Then cleaxly 
F is (Bochner) almost periodic with the same e-period than the 
function / . Now since 
D{cQF{t),cQF{t 
+ T))<\F{t)-F{t 
+ 
i)\^D{c,0), 
where Oe Rjr , it is immediate that y{t) = cQ F{t) is B-ahnost 
periodic ( i.e. in the sense of Definition 3.8y (i)). 
It remains to prove that y{t) is differentiable and satisfies the 
fuzzy differential equation. 
Indeed, let h > 0. By hypothesis we have F{t + h), F(t) > 0, 
for all 
teR. 
On the other hand

3.5 Bibliographical Remarks and Open 
Problems 
In this chapter the main properties of real-valued almost periodic 
functions were extended to fuzzy-number-valued almost periodic 
functions as in [23], [80]. 
Apphcations to dynamical systems as in Section 1.6.2 are also 
possible (see B. Bede and S. G, Gal [40] for details). 
It would be interesting to use other concepts of differentiabilty 
in fuzzy settings in the study of fuzzy differential equations as 
indicated by B. Bede and S. Gal ([9, 40]).

Almost Automorphy in Fuzzy Setting 
4.1 Introduction 
The purpose of this chapter is to extend the main properties of 
Banach-space-valued almost automorphic functions as presented 
in [80], to fuzzy-number-valued almost automorphic functions. 
This is done in Section 4-3 below. 
Although majority of proofs follow standard ideas of proofs in 
Chapter 2 of [80], however, their adaptation requires a careful ma-
nipulation of the properties in the complete metric spaces (R^, D) 
and (X,®,0,d) (see Section 3,1 for details). 
Also the facts that R^ (and X) with respect to addition ® is 
not a group and that with respect to real scalars multiphcation 
© too is not a linear space (the distributivity of stun + of reals 
with respect to © does not hold in general, it holds only if the real 
scalars are all > 0 or all < 0), require changes of some concepts 
and proofs. 

124 
4 Almost Automorphy in Fuzzy Setting 
Section 4*^ contains new spaces constructed with the aid of 
(Rjr.D)^ with properties similar to those of (Rjr,!?), fact which 
permits to enlarge considerably the applicabiUty of the theory. 
In Section 4*4^^ present some applications to fuzzy differential 
equations. 
4.2 Preliminaries 
With the aid of (R^^r, ®, 0, D) introduced in Chapter 3, let us define 
new spaces, as follows. 
(1) (7([a, 6];lR^)-the space of all continuous functions / : [a, 6] ~> 
R^, endowed with the metric -D*(/, g) = sup{Z>(/(x), ^(x)); x € 
[a, 6]} (and the natural operations induced by those in R^;) 
(2) For 1 < p < +00, i7([a,6];R^) the space of strongly measinr-
able functions on [a,6], / : [a, 6] —> RJF, such that 
(L) 
f 
D^{QJ{x))dx<+oo, 
J a 
endowed with the metric 
D,{f,9) = [{L)£iy>{f{x),g{x))d:^ ; 
(3) For 1 < p < +00, 
OO 
11^ = {x = {xn)\Xn € R:F,Vn e N , 5 3 ||a;n||?r < +00}, 
n=l 
endowed with the metric 

4.2 Preliminaries 
125 
(4) rriR^-the space of all sequences of fuzzy numbers x = {Xn)n^ 
bounded in the "norm" ||.||^, i.e. there exists M > 0 (de-
pending on x) such that ||a:n||:r < M, for all n € N, en-
dowed with the metric li{x^y) = sup{Z?(xn,2/n);^ € N}, for 
all X = {Xn)n^y 
= {yn)n ^ RjF \ 
(5) CR^-the space of all convergent sequences (in the metric D) 
of fuzzy nimibers and c^^-the space of all convergent to 0 se-
quences of fuzzy numbers, both endowed with the metric /i 
from the above case; 
(6) First we need the following known definition : 
/ : [a, h] -^ Rj: is called Hukuhara differentiable on x G (^,6), 
if there is 5 > 0 such that for all 0 < /i < J there exist the 
quantities f{x + h)Qf{x), 
f{x)Of{x-h) 
and / € Kjr denoted 
by f{x)^ such that 
Irni P ( i © (fix + h)e m),fix)) 
= 
lim D ( l © (fix) e fix - h)), fix)) 
= 0. 
For p G N, one considers the space 
C^([a,6];E^) = {/ : [a,6] -> lR^;3/(^) G C([a,6];R^)}, 
endowed with the metric D*{f,g) = X^f^^ D*{f^\g^^), 
where the 
derivative is in Hukuhara sense. 
The class of Hukuhara differentiable fuzzy-number-valued func-
tions can considerably be enlarged, with the aid of the following 
more general definition of differentiability introduced in [40] : 
A function / : (a, 6) —> M^ is called generalized differentiable 
on t G (a, 6) if: 

126

(i) There exist f{t + h) e f(t), f(t) Q f{t - h), for oil h > 0

(Here all the limits are considered in the metric D and h or —/i at 
denominators, in fact means ^ 0 or —^0, respectively). 
It is evident that Hukuhara differentiabihty implies the gener-
alized differentiability but the converse implication does not hold. 
Also, the space 
C^([a,6];R^) = {/ : [a, 6] -^ M^;3/(P> € C([a,6];R^)}, 
can be considered for the generalized differentiability too. 

4.2 Preliminaries 
127 
Remark 4-1- AH these spaces have been studied m [38], where as 
a conclusion it is derived that if we denote by {X, ®, ©, d) any 
from the spaces considered by the previous points l)-6), endowed 
of course with the natural operations ©, 0 induced by those © and 
© in Mjr, then it has all the properties of (K^, ®, ©, D), presented 
in Chapter 3. 
Also, any finite Cartesian product of the spaces considered 
above (including (R^, D) too) endowed with the "box metric" (i.e. 
d = max{pi;i}) and with the nattual induced operations © and 
©, has all the above mentioned properties of (R^, ®, ©, Z?). 
Finally, let us note that the definitions of Hukuhara differentia-
bility and of generalized differentiability, can similarly be consid-
ered if the function / : (a, 6) ~> R^ is replaced by / : (a, b) —> X, 
where (X, ®, ©, d) is any from the above mentioned spaces. 
Let us recall now some elements of operator theory and semi-
group of operators on (A',®,©,^) in [38], where (X,©,©,(i) de-
notes any from the above mentioned spaces (including the case 
X = R^). 
Definition 4«2* (i) A: X -> X is called linear operator if 
A{X©x©/x©t/) 
= A© A{x) ® /i© A(y), 
for all A,/i 6 R and all x^y € X. 
(ii) The family T = {T{t)),t G R+} of continuous linear operators 
on X is called Co-semigroup if : 
1) For allx G X, the mapping T{t){x) :R^ -^ X is continuous 
with respect to t >0 ; 

128 
4 Almost Automorphy in Fuzzy Setting 
2) T{t + s) = T{t)[T{s)], for all t.seR^ 
; ^ 
3) T(0) = /, where I is the identity operator on X ; 
(Hi) If A : X -^ X is a linear operator, then it is called generator 
of the Co-semigroup, if for all x E X, there exists T(t){x) 0 x 
and lim/,N^o d{A{x), \ © [T{t){x) Q x]) = 0. 
Theorem 4.3. ([38]) 
(i) If A : X -^ X is linear and continuous on Ox, then for all 
x £ X we have 
||A(a:)||^<|||^||W|x||^, 
where \\\A\\\:r = sup{||>l(a:)||:F;x € X, \\x\\jr < 1} € R. If A is 
linear on X and continuous on Ox, then it does not follow the 
continuity of A on the whole space X. 
All these considerations remain valid if instead to be linear, A 
is supposed to be only additive (i.e. A{x ®y)= 
A{x) © A{y)) 
and positive homogeneous (i.e A(\ © x) = A 0 A{x), for all 
\>0). 
(a) (Uniform boundedness principle) Let {Aj^j G J} be a family of 
additive, positive homogeneous and continuous operators on X. 
If {Aj^j G J} is pointwise bounded (i.e. for any x e X, there 
exists ME G K such that \\Aj{x)\\jr < M^.'ij G J), then there 
exists a real number M > 0 such that \\\Aj\\\j: < M,^j G J. 
(Hi) For any A, linear and continuous operator on X, can be defined 
the linear and continuous operators T{t) = e^^^,t G M 61/

4 Almost Automorphy in Fuzzy Setting 
Here the integral for functions defined on a compact interval with 
values in X is considered in the Riemann (classical) sense (see for 
instance [80]). 
4.3 Basic Definitions and Properties 
Everywhere in the rest of the chapter, (X, ®, 0,d) will denote 
any from the spaces (including (R^^r,®, ©,£))) considered by the 
previous section. 
Starting from the Bochner-kind definition for the almost auto-
morphy, in this section we develop a theory of almost automorphic 
functions with values in (X, ©, ©, d), similar to that for Banach-
space valued functions (see [80]). 
We rewrite Definition 1.29 as follows. 
Definition 4.4. . We say that a continuous function f : R —^ 
X, is almost automorphic, if every sequence of real numbers (r^), 
contains a subsequence (sn), such that there exists g{t) G X with 
the property 
lim d(g{t)j{t 
+ sn))= 
lim d(g{t - Sn)J(t)) 
= 0. 
for each t G R 
Remark 4-5. As in the classical theory, the above convergence on 
R is pointwise. The concept of almost automorphy in Definition 
4.4, is more general than almost periodicity in Bochner's sense. 
Indeed, if the convergence in Definition 4-4 is imiform on R, then 

4.3 Basic Definitions and Properties 
131 
according to the theory developped in Chapter <?, we get the almost 
periodicity. 
Note that although the proof of Theorem 3.16m [40] is given for 
functions with values in R^, however because of the considerations 
in the previous Section 4-^^ it remains valid for functions with 
values in X. 
Also, there exist almost automorphic functions which are not 
almost periodic. For example, take X = Rjr and define f(x) 
= 
cQg{x), X € M, where c € M^ and ^ : R —> R is an example in e.g. 
[89], of almost automorphic function which is not almost periodic. 
Then it easily follows that / is almost automorphic in the sense of 
the above Definition 4-4 but it is not almost periodic in Bochner's 
sense, i.e. as in Chapter 3 Definition 3.8. 
The following elementary properties hold. 
Theorem 4*6. . ///, /i, /2 : R -> X are almost automorphic func-
tions then we have : 
(i) /i ® /2 is almost automorphic ; 
(a) cQ f is almost automorphic for every scalar c € R ; 
(Hi) fait) := f{t + a)yt 
€ R is almost automorphic for each 
fixed a e R ; 
(iv) f is bounded, i.e. sup{||/(f)||^;t € R} < +oo ; 
(v) The range Rj = {/(t);t € R} is relatively compact in the 
complete metric space (X^d); 
(vi) The function h defined by h{t) := f{—t),t e R is almost 
automorphic; 

132 
4 Almost Automorphy in Fuzzy Setting 
(vii) If f(t) = Ox for all t > a for some real number a, then 
f(t) = Ox for all t e R; 
(viii) If A : X -^ Y is continuous, where Y also is any from 
the spaces considered in Section 4-2, then A(f) :R^Y 
is almost 
automorphic. 
(ix) Assume that A : X -^ X is a continuous linear opera-
tor on X and x{t) = e^^'^(xo)^ t e R is almost automorphic for 
some Xo € X. If there exists a bounded subset K ofR^ such that 
iiif{||a:(t)||:r;t eK} 
= 0, then x{t) = Ox, for all t G R; 
(x) Let hn :R-^ 
X^neN 
be a sequence of almost automorphic 
functions such that hn{t) -^ h{t) when n -> +oO; uniformly in 
f e E. Then h is almost automorphic. 
Proof, (i) It is immediate from the property, 
d{u®v^w®e) 
< d{u^w) +d(v,e), 
\/ u,v,w^e E X, 
and from Definition 4-4-
(ii) It is immediate from the property, 
d{cQu,cQv) 
= \c\d{u,v)y 
"i u,v e X,\/c 
eR, 
€md from Definition 4-4-
(iii) It is immediate by Definition 4-4* 
(iv) We follow the lines of proof of Theorem 1.31 iv). Indeed, 
let us suppose that sup{||/(t)||^;t € R} == +oo, i.e. there exists a 
sequence of real numbers {rn)n such that ||/(rn)||^ ~> +oo, when 
n -^ +00. 
Since / is almost automorphic, by Definition 4-4 for t = 0, 
there exists a subsequence (sn) of (rn) such that

where ^(0) € X, 
By passing to limit with n —> +00 in the relations 
WfMWj^ = d(OJ(sn)) < d(0,g(Q)) + d(g(0)J(s,,)), 
we get the contradiction d{6yg{0)) = +00. 
(v) Let {/{vn)) be an arbitrary sequence in X. Prom Definition 
44J there exists a subsequence (Sn) of (vn) such that 
lim d(g(0)Jisn)) 
= 0. 
i.e. {f{sn))n is a convergent subsequence of {f{rn)) in the complete 
metric space {X^ d), which proves that Rf is relatively compact in 
(X,d). 
(vi) The proof is similar to the proof of Theorem 2.L4^^ [80]. 
(vii) The proof is identical to the proof of Theorem 2.1.8 in [80]. 
(viii) It is an immediate consequence of Definition 4-4 ^^^ con-
tinuity of A. 
(ix) We follow some ideas in the proof of Theorem 2.L9 [80], 
but adapted to our case. 
Suppose that /C is a bounded subset of R.^ such that 
inf{||x(t)||^;tGi^} = 0. 
We can find a sequence 5n G AT, n € N and y :B.-^ X, such that 
limn->4-oo lk(5n)||:F = 0 and 
lim d{y{t),x{t + Sn))= 
lim d{y{t - Sn),x{t)) = 0,

pointwise on R. 
Because K is bounded, there exists M > 0 such that 
0 < s < M , V s € A ' . 
Prom the above Theorem 4-3, we get 
= e*®^(e*"®^(xo)) 
= e*®^(x(5n)), Vt > 0. 
It follows that 
0 = 
lim d(y{t),x(t + sn))= 
lim <i(y(<),e*®^(x(5„))),Vt > 0. 
n-f+oo 
n—>-|-oo 
On the other hand, by Theorem 4-3, (i) we have 
||e*®^(x(s„))||^<|||e'®^|||H|x(s„)||^, 
which implies 
lim ||e'®^(x(s„))||^ = 0. 
But %(t),Ox) < rf(y(t),e*®^(5„)) +d(e*®^(5„),0x). Passing 
to limit with n -> +00, from the above relation we obtain 
d{y{t),Ox)=0,VteR+, 
which immediately implies 
2/W=6x,VtGR+. 
Now, ioT t> M we get t — s„ > 0, which combined with 

4.3 Basic DeiinJtions and Properties 
135 
lim d{y{t),x{t + s„)) = lim d{y{t - s„), x{t)) = 0, t € R 
and with y(t) = Ox, Vi G R4., immediately proves that 
x{t) = 6x,Vt> 
M. 
Prom the above point (vii), it follows that 
x(t) = 
bx,^teR. 
(x) The proof is identical to the proof of Theorem 2.1.10 [80], 
by using the fact that (X, d) is a complete metric space as well as 
the properties of d as a metric. D 
iZemarA-^.Z The hypothesis in the above Theorem 4-^ (ix) is 
stronger than that in the case of Banach-space valued functions, 
where it is inf{||a:(t)||:F;t G M} = 0. 
This happens because in the case of (X, ®, ©, d) the property 
T{t + 5) = T(t)[T{s)] does not hold for all t,5 € R (it holds only 
for all tjS>OoT 
for all tyS <0 and does not hold if ts < 0). 
Regarding the Hukuhara derivative of almost automorphic 
functions, we present the following result. 
Theorem 4.8. Assume that / : R -> R^ is almost automorphic 
and the Hukuhara derivative f :R —^ Rjr exists and is uniformly 
continuous on R. 
Then f is almost automorphic. 
Proof. Observe that for any a,6 e R, with a < b, the Leibniz-
Newton formula holds, i.e. f{b) = f{a) ® /^ f{t)dt, 
that is there 
exists /(6) e /(a) = jl f{t)dt. 
This implies

The last inequality follows because the continuity of f{s) 
on 
[0, ^] implies the continuity of F{s) = D{f{t+s)jf{t)) 
as function 
of s. 
Prom the uniform continuity of f, for any £ > 0, there exists 
^ > 0, such that for all \s\ < <J, t € M, we have 
D{f'{t + s),f'{t))<e, 
that is there exists no such that for all n > no we have ^ < S and

As a conclusion, the sequence

converges uniformly on M to f{t). 
If we prove that each function Fn{t) is almost automorphic, 
then according to Theorem 4-6 (x), will follow that f is almost 
automorphic. For that, we need to prove the following helpful re-
sult : 
If / I J / 2 are almost automorphic and for all t € M there exists 
/aW = /i(*) © h{t)^ then /a is almost automorphic. 
Indeed, from hypothesis we have fi{t) = /2(t) ® hit),"it 
€ R, 
which according the definition of ® means 
[fiitW = [f2it)Y + [Mt)Y,r e [0,i],teR 
i.e. 
[/i(t)_(r),/i(t)+(r)] = [[/2(t)-(r),/2(t)+(r)] 
+ [/3(t)_(r),/3(0+(r)],Vr€[0,l]. 
This last formula gives for all r € [0,1], < € R 
fsitUr) = MtUr) - 
f2(tUr),Mt)M 
= MtUr) - f2{tUir). 
But from the definition of D, it easily follows that fi{t) is almost 
automorphic, if and only if all real-valued functions, 
/x(0-(r),/i(0+(r),r€[O,l] 
are almost automorphic (as functions of t). 
Similar result holds for f2{t). 

138 
4 Almost Automorphy in Fuzzy Setting 
Then from the classical theory we immediately get that all 
h{t)-(r),fs(t)^{r),r 
€ [0,1] are almost automorphic as fimctions 
of t, which finally gives that fs{t) is almost automorphic. 
The theorem is proved. D 
Regarding the integral of almost automorphic fmictions, we 
present 
Theorem 4.9. Let f : R -^ X be almost automorphic and con-
sider the function F :R-^ 
X defined by F{t) = J^ f{s)ds, where 
{Xj^jQjd) 
is any of the spaces considered in Section 4-^-
Then F is almost automorphic if and only if its range Rp = 
{F{t); t eR} 
is relatively compact in X. 
Proof. We adapt the proof of Theorem 2.4-4 hi [80] to our case. 
According to Theorem 4-6 (v)j it suiRces to prove that if Rp is 
relatively compact, then F is almost automorphic. 
Since / is almost automorphic and Rp is relatively compact in 
X, given (sJO a sequence of real numbers, there exists a subse-
quence s'^) and ai & X such that 
lim d(f(t + s',),g{t))=

used above is well-known in the case of fuzzy-number-valued func-
tions. But it can similarly be extended to functions with values 
in (X, ©, ©, d), taking also into account that all the functions are 
continuous (actually it follows in an easy way from the definition 
of Riemann integral as limit of Riemann integral smns and the 
properties of metric din X). 
Now, denoting G{t) := ai ® f^ g{r)dr, from the relation 
lim d(F{t + O , Git)) = 0, far all t e R, 
we get that the range of G also is relatively compact and the the 
following inequality 
sup{\\Git)\\:F\te

holds. 
So there is a subsequence {sn)n of {Sn)n and a2 € X, such that

we get 
lim d(G{t - Sn),ot2 0 Fit)) = 0.

where we use the notations s = {sn)j As(F) = Ts[T-s{F)] 
and Ts is defined by Ts(F) = H, with H given by the relation 
linin->+oo F(t + Sn) = if (t), Vt e M. 
Denoting A^ := AfAj""^], we get A'^{F){t) = n © a2 0 ^(0-
Firstly, let us prove 
sup{|K(F)(i)||^;< e R}sup{||F(<)|k,< € R}. 
For that, it suffices to prove the inequality 
snp{\\As(F){t)\\jr;t 
eR}< 
sup{||F(Olk,t € R}. 
In this sense we need the following result in (X®, ©, d): if 
lim d(xnJ) = 0, 
n->-foo 
then 
\\1\\:F = d{bxJ) < d{l,Xn) + d{xn,Ox), 
where from passing to limit, we get

As{t), we obtain 
\\AiF){t)\\:r 
< lim ||G(t-5n)|U < ||F(0||^,Vi € M. 
Passing to supremum with i € M, we obtain the desired inequality. 
Note here that because the range of F is relatively compact, it 
follows that sup{||F(i)||:F;* ^ M} < +oo. 
Indeed, since Rp is boimded in the metric space, there exists 
M > 0 such that d{x,y) < M,\/x,y € Rp- Then, we get

tion if a2 7^ 0.

if there exists a 0 6, then 
\\aeb\\jr = d{bx,aeb) 
= d(Ox 0 ^ (a©6) 06) = 
d{b,a) < d(b,Ox) + d{bx.a) = ||a||^ + ||6||^. 
The theorem is thus completely proved. D 
Another useful result concerning the semigroups of operators is 
the following. 
Theorem 4.10. . Let x : R^ -^ X and f : R -^ X be two con-
tinuous functions and T = (T(t))teiR^. be a Co-semigroup of linear 
operators on ( ^ , 0 , ©,d). Suppose that 
x{t) = T{t){x{0)) 0 / r ( t - s)if{s))ds,t

Then for t given in R and b> a> 0, a + t> 0, we have

But if O is a linear operator on X and if there exists the quantity

then 0(x Qy) = 0{x) e 0{y). 
Indeed, if we denote x Q y = a^ it follows x = y ® a and 
0{x) = 0{y) e 0{a), which means 0(a) = 0{x) 0 0{y).

Taking into account that T commutes with the integral (since it

obtain

We then immediately get the required relation in the statement of

AQE = BeE,

This is a trivial consequence of the relations d(A, B) = d{A ®

The proof is achieved. D 
In the study of almost automorphic solutions of nonlinear fuzzy 
differential equations , the following concepts and results can be 
useful. We follow here the ideas in Section 1.6.2. Actually the 
results in the case of Banach spaces remain the same for the case 
of oiu" metric spaces (Jf, ®, 0, rf). 
Definition 4.11. ^4 continuous function f : R x X —> X is said 
to be almost automorphic in t € M for each x & X, if for every 
sequence of real numbers {rn), there exists a subsequence {sn) such 
that for aW t € R and x £ X, there exists g{t^ x) with the property 
lim d{f{t + Sn,x),g{t,x)) 
= lim d{g{t - Sn,x),f{t,x)) 
= 0. 
The following simple properties hold. 
Theorem 4.12. (i) If fi^f2 : M x X -> X ane almost automorphic 
in t for each x E X, then /i ® /2 and cQ fi, where ceR 
are also 
almost automorphic in t for each x E X. 
(a) If f{ty x) is almost automorphic in t for each x & X then 
sup{||/(t,a:)||^;t € M} < +oo. Also, for the corresponding func-
tion g in Definition 4-^1, ^^ have sup{||p(i,x)||^; f € R} < +oo. 

4.3 Basic Defmitions and Properties

(in) If f{tj x) is almost automorphic in t for each x G X and if 
d{f{t,x)J{t,y)) 
< L d{x,y),yx,y 
€ X, 
and t € Ry where L is independent of x^y and t, then for the 
corresponding g in Definition -^.ii; we have 
d{g{t,x),g{t,y)) 
< L d{x,y),'ix,y 
€ X 
and < e M. 
(iv) Let f{t^ x) be almost automorphic in t for each x E X such 
that d{f{t,x)yf{t,y)) 
< L <i(a;,2/),Vx,y € X and t eR, 
where L 
is independent of x^y and t. If (p :R --> X is almost automorphic 
then the function F iR—^ X defined by F{t) = f{t, <p{t)) is almost 
automorphic. 
Proof. The proofs are similgu: to the proofs of the analogous Re-
sults in Section 2.2 in [80] respectively, taking into account that 
everywhere in the proofe, the expressions of the type ||a: — 2/|| in 
the case of Banach spaces have to be replaced by d(x,t/) in the 
case of {X, ©, ©, d) spaces. 
Similar to the classical case in Sections 1.6.1 and 1.6.2, the 
concept in Definition 4-4 can be generalized as follows. 
Definition 4.13. . A continuous function f :R^ -^ X is said to 
be asymptotically almost automorphic if it admits the decomposi-
tion 
f{t)=g{t)ehit), 
i e R + , 
where g : R -^ X is almost automorphic and h : R-^. -^ X is a 
continuous function with limt^-foo l|/^(*)ll^ = 0-

Thus g and h are called the principal and the corrective terms 
of f, respectively. 
Remark 4'M* Every almost automorphic function restricted to R+ 
is asymptotically almost automorphic, by taking h{t) = Ox,Vi G 
R+. 
Regarding this new concept, the following results in the classical 
case hold. 
Theorem 4.15. . Let /,/i,/2 be asymptotically almost automor-
phic. Then we have : 
(i) h®f2 
o.Tid cQfjCeR 
are asymptotically almost automor-
phic ; 
(a) For fixed a eR^, 
the function fa{t) = f{t + a) is asymp-
totically almost automorphic ; 
(Hi) f is bounded, i.e. snp{\\f{t)\\jr]t 
G R4-} < +00. 
(iv) Let (A',®,©,d),(y,©,0,p) be any from the spaces con-
sidered in Section 4-^ 0,'^d f : R4. -^ X be an almost automor-
phic function, f = g ® h. Let (j> : X —^ Y be continuous and 
assume there is a compact set B in (A', d) which contains the clo-
sures of {f{t)\t 
e R^} and {g{t);t G R+}. If, in addition, for 
all i G R4. there exists continuous r(t) = ^{f{t)) 0 (t>{g{t)), then 
(/>o f :R^ -^Y 
is asymptotically almost periodic ; 
(v) In general, the decomposition of an asymptotically almost 
automorphic function is not unique. 
Proof, (i) and (ii) are immediate from Definition 4-i3 dnid Theo-
rem 4  6, (i), (ii), (Hi). 

4.3 Basic Definitions and Properties 
147 
(iv) We have <^(/(0) = Hdi*)) ® ^(*)> where by Theorem 4.6, 
(via) , </>(g{t)) is almost automorphic. Therefore, it remains to 
prove that lim^^+oo ll-^C^)!!^ = 0-
We get 
\\ry = PiOYMm)eH9m 
= p{<l>{gm<l>{f{t)) e <l>(g(t)) e 
Hgm 
=p{<f>i9(t)Uim)). 
For the rest of the proof, we follow the lines as in the proof of 
Theorem 2.5.7in [80]. 
Here we have used the property that 
/ / 
Ujb E X are such that aQb exists, then (a© 6) © 6 = a. 
This is atraightforward. Indeed, denoting rr = a © 6, by defini-
tion we get a = a:®6, which implies (a©6) ®6 = [(a:©6) ©6] ® 6 = 
X ©6 = a, because it is evident that {x®b)Qb 
= x. 
(v) First, we prove the following relation : if a,6, c G X are 
such that there exists 6 © c, then a © (6 © c) = (a © 6) © c. Indeed, 
denoting x = 6 © c, by definition we get 6 = x © c and therefore 
(a © 6) © c) = {a® X ® c) Q c = a © x = a © (6 © c), because, 
in general it is immediate that {A® B) Q B = A. Note that this 
relation does not hold if 6 © c does not exist. 
Let us suppose that f :R^ -^ X admits two decompositions 
f{t) = giit)ehi{t),teR^,i 
= h2. 
We get 
gi{t)®hi{t)=g2{t)®h2{t), 

148 
4 Almost Automorphy in Fuzzy Setting 
which imphes 
9i(t) = 
[g2(t)eh2{t)]ehi{t) 
and /i2(t) = [hi{t)®gi{t)]eg2{t), 
for all t G E+. 
Now, let us suppose that for each t € M-i- there exists /i2(*) © 
Then by the above relation we get gi{t) = g2(t) ® [h2{t) Qhi{t)] 
or /i2(0 = hi{t)®[gi{t)Qg2{t)]^ respectively. Both cases imply the 
same relation gi{t) Q g2{t) = h2{t) © /ii(t), Vt € R+. In this case, 
we obtain 
d(gi(t) ©g2{t),Ox) = d{h2{t) ©hi{t),Qx) < 
d{h2{t),Qx) + d{QxMi)) = 11/^2(011^ + l|/^i(*)ll^-
Passing to limit with t -4 -f 00, we get 
lim d{gi{t)eg2{t),0x) 
= 0. 
According to the proof of Theorem 4-6, gi{t) 0 g2{t) is almost 
automorphic. Considering the sequence n, n = 1,2, ...„ there exists 
a subsequence {rik) such that 
lim d{gi{t + rik) © g2it + n^), F(t)) = 
AC->-fOO 
lim d(gi(t) e 92it), F{t - n^)) = 0, 
pointwise on R. 
Using the inequality 
d(F(t),Ox) < d{gi{t)eg2it),bx)+d(gi(t 
+ nk)eg2{t + nk),F{t)), 

4.3 Basic Definitions and Properties 
149 
and passing to limit with k -> +00, it follows that F{t) = Ox, Vi € 
M and consequently gi{t)Qg2{t) == Ox, V< e E. Therefore, gi = g2 
and hi = /i2-
As a conclusion, the uniqueness follows only in the special case 
when for each t € R-|. there exists h2{t) Q hi(t) or gi(t) Q g2{t). 
But in general, this condition does not hold, which implies that 
the imiqueness of decomposition does not hold. D 
Remark 4-16. 1) In comparison with the case of Banach-space val-
ued functions, in Theorem 4*^5, (iv) we need the additional hy-
pothesis that for all t € M-i-, there exists (continuous) r(t) 
= 
<t>{m) e <l>{9{t)). 
2) The effect of Theorem 4-15, (v), is that it produces less prop-
erties than in the classical case. 
In what follows, we are concerned with the asymptotical be-
havior of asymptotically almost automorphic semigroups of lin-
ear operators T = T(t)yt € M-f on (X,©,0,rf). We present some 
topological and asymptotic properties based on the Nemytskii and 
Stepanov theory of dynamical systems as presented in Section 
1.6.2. 
Definition 4.17. . A mapping u : R^ x X -^ X is called a dy-
namical system if : 
(i) ui^xjx) 
= a:,Vx G X ; 
(ii) it(.,x) : M4. —» X is continuous for any t > 0 and right-
continuous att = 0, for each x £ X. (The mapping u{., x) is called 
a motion originating at x £ X). 

150 
4 Almost Automorphy in Fuzzy Setting 
(Hi) u{tj.) : X --> X is continuous for each 
t>0; 
(iv) u{t + s,x) = u{t^u{s,x)),Wx 
E X^t^s E M+. 
We now present the following important correspondence. 
Theorem 4»18. . Every Co-semigroup {T{t))t>o on (X,®, ©,d) 
determines a dynamical system and conversely, by defining u{t^ x) = 
T{t){x),teR^,xeX. 
Proof, Similar to Theorem 1.43. 
In the rest of this section, T = {T{t))t^^_^ will be a Co-
semigroup of linear operators on (X, ®, ©, d) such that for fixed 
Xo € X, the motion T{t){xo) : M-^ —> A' is an asymptotically al-
most automorphic function in the sense of Definition ^.i5, with 
principal term / and corrective term h. 
Definition 4.19, . A function (p :R^ 
X is said to be a complete 
trajectory of T if it satisfies the functional equation 
ip{t)=T{t-a){<p{a)), 
for alia eR^t> 
a. 
We have the following 
Theorem 4.20, . The principal term f ofT{t){xo) 
is a complete 
trajectory for T. 
Proof Similar to the proof of Theorem 1.45* 

4.3 Basic Definitions and Properties 
151 
Definition 4.21. 
u;+{xo) = {yeX;30<tn^+oo, 
lim d{T{t){xo),y) = 0} 
n—>-|-oo 
is called the u;-limit set 
ofT(t){xo). 
^t{xo) = {yeX;30<tn^+oo, 
lim 
d{f{tn),y)=0} 
is called the uj4imit set of f, the principal term ofT(t){xo)* 
7+(xo) = {T(t){xo);te 
R+} is the trajectory 
ofT(t){xo). 
A set B C X is said to be invariant under the semigroup T = 
{T{t))teR^, if 
T{t){y)eB,WyeB,teR^. 
e E X is called a rest-point for the semigroup T if 
r(t)(e) = e,Vt>0. 
The following properties hold. 
Theorem 4.22. » (i) a;'*"(xo) is not empty, LJ'^{XO) = 
uj{xo), 
a;'^(xo) is invariant under T and is closed in X, uj'^{xo) is com-
pact ify^{xo) 
is relatively compact Also, if XQ is a rest-point of 
the semigroup T then u)'^{xo) = {xo}. 
(a) If we denote 7/(xo) = {/(*);* ^ R} then 7/(a:o) is relatively 
compact and invariant under the semigroup T, 
(Hi) If we denote v{t) = iiif{d(T(t(xo),?/);?/ G a;"^(xo)}; then 
limt_,+oo ^{t) = 0. 
Remark 4-23. All the above results show us that the properties in 
the cases of Banach spaces, remain valid for the case of the more 
general (X, ®, 0, d) spaces.

4.4 Applications to Fuzzy Differential 
Equations 
It is known that the classical (abstract) differential equations ,i.e. 
whose solutions are real-valued functions (or Banach-space valued 
functions, respectively) often represent an idealization of real situ-
ations, where imprecision may in fact play a significant role. A way 
to solve this shortcoming is to consider random differential equa^ 
tions (i.e. whose solutions are random-variable-valued functions), 
which have been used to incorporate the effects of statistical fluc-
tuations. 
On the other hand, imprecision due to uncertainty or vagueness 
suggests the introduction of so-called fuzzy differential equations, 
i.e whose solutions represent functions with values in R^ or more 
general, with values in X, where (X, ®, O, d) represents any from 
the spaces introduced in Section 4-2. Applications of the semigroup 
of operators in solving fuzzy partial differential equations have 
been done in the recent paper [38]. 
Now we like to illustrate the idea of propagation of almost au-
tomorphy from the fuzzy input data to the solutions of fuzzy dif-
ferential equations. 
The first result in this sense is the following. 
Theorem 4.24. . Let us consider the fuzzy differential equation 
y\t)ey{t)=g{t), 

4.4 Applications to Fuzzy Differential Equations 
153 
where y\t) 
means the Hukuhara derivative , p : R -> E^ is of 
the particular form g(t) = c 0 /(t), Vi € M^ with c € Mjr a fuzzy 
number and / : R -> R a usual almost automorphic function. 
In addition suppose that f satisfies the condition /(<) > 0, Vi € 
R. 
Then the function defined by y :R-^ 
R^ defined by 
y(t)=cQ 
f 
e'''^f{u)du, 
J—oo 
is a almost automorphic function on R and satisfies the above fuzzy 
differential equation for all t e O, where 
n = {te R; fit) > f 
e''--'f{u)du}. 
J—oo 
Proof* First we notice that by the hypothesis on / and by Def-
inition 4-4^ it immediately follows that ^ : R -^ R^ is almost 
automorphic. 
Now, according to [38], Section 4, Theorem 14, y{t) satisfies the 
fuzzy equations for alH G 1?. 
Then the function F{t) = J_^ e^^^f{u)du is almost automor-
phic on R, which by the Definition 4-4 and the properties of D 
immediately implies that y{t) = c © F(t) is almost automorphic. 
Remark 4-25. Theorem 4-^4 remains valid for the more general dif-
ferential equation 
y\t)eyit) 
= git), 
where y\t) means the Hukuhara derivative , ^ : R —> X is of the 
particular form g{t) = c©/(£), Vt € R, with c e X a n d / : R - ^ R 
a usual almost automorphic function, and (X, ®, ©, d) is any from 
the spaces considered by the previous sections. 

154 
4 Almost Automorphy in Fuzzy Setting 
Before to consider the next result, let us make some remarks on 
the concepts of differentiability presented in Section 4-^- Firstly, 
note that the Hukuhara differentiability has the following short-
coming : if c is a fuzzy number, / is a real valued function (of real 
variable) differentiable on t and g{t) = cQ f{t) then for f{t) > 0 
we have g'{t) = cQf{t), 
while for f'(t) < 0 , the function g is not 
Hukuhara differentiable on t. 
This shortcoming is solved by the generalized differentiability, 
which at its turn has another shortcoming : if f{t) = 0, then g is 
not necessarily generalized differentiable on t. 
In the paper [9] these kinds of shortcomings are completely 
solved in such a way that g is always differentiable (in the new 
sense), if / is differentiable. The new concept of differentiabiUty 
can be stated as follows (see [9]) : 
Let / : (a, 6) —^ Rjr be and t 6 (a, 6). For a sequence of real 
nimabers hn \ 0, let us consider the sets 
4^) = {n> p; 3Ei'^ = /{t + K) 0 /(t)}, 
42) = {n>p- 342) = /(t) e f{t + hn)}, 
43) = {n>p; 3^(3) = m e fit - hn)}, 
Ajf) = {n > p; 3£W = fit - hn) e /(*)}. 
We say that / is weakly generaUzed differentiable on £, if for 
any sequence hn \ 0, there exists p € N such that 
4>U4'^U4'^U^?^ = {n € N',n>p} 
and moreover, there exists an element in Rjr denoted by f{t), such 
that if for some j € {1,2,3,4} we have card{A^p) = +oo, then 

4.4 Applications to Fuzzy Differential Equations 
155 
lim 
,D{{-iy+'QEi,f'(t))=0. 
Remark 4*26. Obviously the generalized differentiability implies 
the weakly generalized differentiability but the converse is not true. 
Now we are in position to present the following. 
Theorem 4.27* . Let us consider the fuzzy wave equation 
&^u{x,t) 
1 &^u{x,t) 
with the boundary conditions 
-,t>0,a:GR, 
duix 0) 
u{x, 0) = a © f{x), — ^ 7 - ^ = kg{x) © a, x G R 
dt 
where a € R^, c,k G R,c > 0 and f,g :R -^ R, with f 
ofC^-
class and g of C^-class. Here the differentiability is considered in 
the weak generalized sense. 
Then 
u 
rx-^ct 
u{x, i) = a © {[fix - ct) + f{x + ct)]/2 + — 
g{s)ds} 
^^ Jx-ct 
satisfies the above fuzzy differential equation, and if in addition, f 
and g are almost automorphic, and F{x) = f^ g{s)ds is bounded 
on R, then for each fixed t>0, 
the solution u{., t) is almost auto-
morphic. 
Proof* It is evident from the classical theory that the fimction 
between the brackets in the above expression of u{x^ t) is almost 
automorphic with respect to the variable x (for each fixed t), which 
by Definition 4-4 immediately implies that u{x^ t) also is almost 
automorphic with respect to x. 

156 
4 Almost Automorphy in Fuzzy Setting 
Also, the fact that u{x, t) satisfies the above fuzzy wave equa-
tion is immediate from the classical theory and from the property 
of the above weak generalized differentiability. 
Remark 4-^8. According to the above Theorem ^.5, the so-called 
mild solution 
u{t) = T{t)(uo) ® I T{t- 
s)g{s)ds, 
Jo 
where T{t) represents the exponential operators in the same The-
orem 4^3, (Hi), satisfies the abstract "fuzzy" differential equation 
u\t) = 
A[u{t)]®g{t), 
where u' is considered in the generalized sense.

4,5 Bibliographical Remarks and Open 
Problems 
This chapter is based on a study by S. G. Gal and G. M. 
N'Guerekata ([41]). 
It would be of interest to see for a Bohr-Neugebauer-N'Guerekata-
type result (see e.g. [30]) in the case discussed in the last section 
above, i.e. how almost automorphy of the forced term along with 
other conditions, on the operator for instance, would produce al-
most automorphy of the solution to the fuzzy differential equation. 
Also extensions to fuzzy settings of the results in Theorems 2.17 
and Theorem 2.18 were obtained by C. S. Gal, S. G. Gal and G. 
N. N'Guerekata ([42]).
