Real Functions in Several Variables: Volume III 
Differentiable Functions in Several Variables

Preface
Preface
The topic of this series of books on “Real Functions in Several Variables” is very important in the
description in e.g. Mechanics of the real 3-dimensional world that we live in. Therefore, we start from
the very beginning, modelling this world by using the coordinates of R3 to describe e.g. a motion in
space. There is, however, absolutely no reason to restrict ourselves to R3 alone. Some motions may
be rectilinear, so only R is needed to describe their movements on a line segment. This opens up for
also dealing with R2, when we consider plane motions. In more elaborate problems we need higher
dimensional spaces. This may be the case in Probability Theory and Statistics. Therefore, we shall in
general use Rn as our abstract model, and then restrict ourselves in examples mainly to R2 and R3.
For rectilinear motions the familiar rectangular coordinate system is the most convenient one to apply.
However, as known from e.g. Mechanics, circular motions are also very important in the applications
in engineering. It becomes natural alternatively to apply in R2 the so-called polar coordinates in the
plane. They are convenient to describe a circle, where the rectangular coordinates usually give some
nasty square roots, which are diﬃcult to handle in practice.
Rectangular coordinates and polar coordinates are designed to model each their problems.
They
supplement each other, so diﬃcult computations in one of these coordinate systems may be easy, and
even trivial, in the other one. It is therefore important always in advance carefully to analyze the
geometry of e.g. a domain, so we ask the question: Is this domain best described in rectangular or in
polar coordinates?
Sometimes one may split a problem into two subproblems, where we apply rectangular coordinates in
one of them and polar coordinates in the other one.
It should be mentioned that in real life (though not in these books) one cannot always split a problem
into two subproblems as above.
Then one is really in trouble, and more advanced mathematical
methods should be applied instead. This is, however, outside the scope of the present series of books.
The idea of polar coordinates can be extended in two ways to R3. Either to semi-polar or cylindric
coordinates, which are designed to describe a cylinder, or to spherical coordinates, which are excellent
for describing spheres, where rectangular coordinates usually are doomed to fail. We use them already
in daily life, when we specify a place on Earth by its longitude and latitude! It would be very awkward
in this case to use rectangular coordinates instead, even if it is possible.
Concerning the contents, we begin this investigation by modelling point sets in an n-dimensional
Euclidean space En by Rn.
There is a subtle diﬀerence between En and Rn, although we often
identify these two spaces. In En we use geometrical methods without a coordinate system, so the
objects are independent of such a choice. In the coordinate space Rn we can use ordinary calculus,
which in principle is not possible in En. In order to stress this point, we call En the “abstract space”
(in the sense of calculus; not in the sense of geometry) as a warning to the reader. Also, whenever
necessary, we use the colour black in the “abstract space”, in order to stress that this expression is
theoretical, while variables given in a chosen coordinate system and their related concepts are given
the colours blue, red and green.
We also include the most basic of what mathematicians call Topology, which will be necessary in the
following. We describe what we need by a function.
Then we proceed with limits and continuity of functions and deﬁne continuous curves and surfaces,
with parameters from subsets of R and R2, resp..

Preface
Continue with (partial) diﬀerentiable functions, curves and surfaces, the chain rule and Taylor’s for-
mula for functions in several variables.
We deal with maxima and minima and extrema of functions in several variables over a domain in Rn.
This is a very important subject, so there are given many worked examples to illustrate the theory.
Then we turn to the problems of integration, where we specify four diﬀerent types with increasing
complexity, plane integral, space integral, curve (or line) integral and surface integral.
Finally, we consider vector analysis, where we deal with vector ﬁelds, Gauß’s theorem and Stokes’s
theorem. All these subjects are very important in theoretical Physics.
The structure of this series of books is that each subject is usually (but not always) described by three
successive chapters. In the ﬁrst chapter a brief theoretical theory is given. The next chapter gives
some practical guidelines of how to solve problems connected with the subject under consideration.
Finally, some worked out examples are given, in many cases in several variants, because the standard
solution method is seldom the only way, and it may even be clumsy compared with other possibilities.
I have as far as possible structured the examples according to the following scheme:
A Awareness, i.e. a short description of what is the problem.
D Decision, i.e. a reﬂection over what should be done with the problem.
I Implementation, i.e. where all the calculations are made.
C Control, i.e. a test of the result.
This is an ideal form of a general procedure of solution. It can be used in any situation and it is not
linked to Mathematics alone. I learned it many years ago in the Theory of Telecommunication in a
situation which did not contain Mathematics at all. The student is recommended to use it also in
other disciplines.
From high school one is used to immediately to proceed to I. Implementation. However, examples
and problems at university level, let alone situations in real life, are often so complicated that it in
general will be a good investment also to spend some time on the ﬁrst two points above in order to
be absolutely certain of what to do in a particular case. Note that the ﬁrst three points, ADI, can
always be executed.
This is unfortunately not the case with C Control, because it from now on may be diﬃcult, if possible,
to check one’s solution. It is only an extra securing whenever it is possible, but we cannot include it
always in our solution form above.
I shall on purpose not use the logical signs. These should in general be avoided in Calculus as a
shorthand, because they are often (too often, I would say) misused. Instead of ∧I shall either write
“and”, or a comma, and instead of ∨I shall write “or”. The arrows ⇒and ⇔are in particular
misunderstood by the students, so they should be totally avoided. They are not telegram short hands,
and from a logical point of view they usually do not make sense at all! Instead, write in a plain
language what you mean or want to do. This is diﬃcult in the beginning, but after some practice it
becomes routine, and it will give more precise information.
When we deal with multiple integrals, one of the possible pedagogical ways of solving problems has
been to colour variables, integrals and upper and lower bounds in blue, red and green, so the reader
by the colour code can see in each integral what is the variable, and what are the parameters, which

do not enter the integration under consideration. We shall of course build up a hierarchy of these
colours, so the order of integration will always be deﬁned. As already mentioned above we reserve
the colour black for the theoretical expressions, where we cannot use ordinary calculus, because the
symbols are only shorthand for a concept.
The author has been very grateful to his old friend and colleague, the late Per Wennerberg Karlsson,
for many discussions of how to present these diﬃcult topics on real functions in several variables, and
for his permission to use his textbook as a template of this present series. Nevertheless, the author
has felt it necessary to make quite a few changes compared with the old textbook, because we did not
always agree, and some of the topics could also be explained in another way, and then of course the
results of our discussions have here been put in writing for the ﬁrst time.
The author also adds some calculations in MAPLE, which interact nicely with the theoretic text.
Note, however, that when one applies MAPLE, one is forced ﬁrst to make a geometrical analysis of
the domain of integration, i.e. apply some of the techniques developed in the present books.
The theory and methods of these volumes on “Real Functions in Several Variables” are applied
constantly in higher Mathematics, Mechanics and Engineering Sciences. It is of paramount importance
for the calculations in Probability Theory, where one constantly integrate over some point set in space.
It is my hope that this text, these guidelines and these examples, of which many are treated in more
ways to show that the solutions procedures are not unique, may be of some inspiration for the students
who have just started their studies at the universities.
Finally, even if I have tried to write as careful as possible, I doubt that all errors have been removed.
I hope that the reader will forgive me the unavoidable errors.

Introduction to volume III,  
Differentiable Functions in  Several Variables
Introduction to volume III,
Diﬀerentiable Functions in Several Variables
This is the third volume in the series of books on Real Functions in Several Variables. Its topic is
diﬀerential functions. The idea of diﬀerentiability goes back to the technique of approximation of a
problem by linearizing it. Consider a diﬀerentiable function f : A →R, A ⊆R, in only one variable.
When we want to describe the behaviour of f in the neighbourhood of a point x0 ∈A, we may
approximately describe the graph of f by its tangent at the point (x0, f (x0)), i.e. the line given by
the equation
y = f (x0) + f ′ (x0) · (x −x0) = f (x0) + f ′ (x0) h,
where we have introduced the new variable h := x −x0, which is actually used on the tangent.
It is tempting to extend this model to higher dimensions. If f : A →R is a diﬀerentiable function in
two variables (x, y) (whatever “diﬀerentiable” means in this case; it has not been deﬁned yet), then
it would be natural to approximate f(x, y) instead by approximating the graph of f at a given point
by its tangent plane at this point. The tangent plane should be 2-dimensional, so the points of the
tangent plane are speciﬁed by the chosen point x = (x, y) ∈A and the two coordinates h = (h1, h2)
“living on” the approximating plane. Therefore, it is natural to expect that the function is a function
in two sets of variables, (x, h) ∈A × R2.
The program above clearly needs a lot of tidying, where we ﬁrst must deviate from the general idea. In
the ﬁrst section we make the deﬁnitions precise and show that the diﬀerentiability in higher dimensions
has most of its properties in common with diﬀerentiability in one dimension.
We also introduce
diﬀerentiable vector functions, at the approximating polynomial of degree 1 in the coordinates. The
latter is closely connected with the equation of the tangent (hyper)plane of the graph, but it also
opens up for other generalizations later on.
Then follows a section on the chain rule, which describes how one diﬀerentiates a composite function
in several variables. This section is fairly technical, and the author has had many discussions with his
late colleague, Per Wennerberg Karlsson, of how to present the matter in the best way.

Diﬀerentiable functions in several variables
9.1
Diﬀerentiability
9.1.1
The gradient and the diﬀerential
We shall ﬁrst consider the well-known case of a diﬀerentiable function in one variable. The reason is
that we then are able to analyze how to proceed with the generalization to diﬀerentiable functions in
several variables.
When f : A →R, A ⊆R is a function in just one variable, there are two equivalent ways to introduce
diﬀerentiability of f. The ﬁrst method, known from high school, requires that the diﬀerence quotient
at x below has a well-deﬁned limit for h →0, i.e.
(9.1)
f(x + h) −f(x)
h
→a
for h →0.
The second method, which here may be obtained from (9.1), when we multiply by h, requires that
the increase of the function f at the point x satisﬁes
(9.2)
f(x + h) −f(x) = ah + ε(h)|h|,
where a is some constant, and where ε(h) denotes some function, for which ε(h) →0 for h →0. Since
we can redeﬁne ε(h) and build in the sign of h, we may just write ε(h)h instead of ε(h)|h|.
Let us turn to functions in several variables, like f : A →R, where A ⊆Rn and n ≥2. It follows
immediately that we cannot generalize (9.1), because the pair (x, h) in one dimensional should be
replaced by the pair of vectors (x, h). A generalization of (9.1) would require that we should have a
vector h in the denominator, and that is not possible.
Fortunately, (9.2) is easy to generalize.
Deﬁnition 9.1 Diﬀerentiability. Let A ⊆Rn be an open set, and let f : A →R be a function on A.
We call f diﬀerentiable at the point x ∈A, if for all h, for which x + h ∈A,
f(x + h) −f(x) = a · h + ε(h)h,
where the vector a is independent ofh is some function, for which ε(h) →0 for h →0.
The interpretation of this deﬁnition of diﬀerentiability at x ∈A is, that the increase (decrease) of the
function,
∆f := f(x + h) −f(x),
behaves locally as a linear function a · h in the increase h of the variable, plus a term ε(h)h, which
tends faster towards 0 for h →0 than the linear function a · h.
In particular, ∆f →0 for h →0, so we get the result:
A diﬀerentiable function at x ∈A is also continuous at x ∈A.

Differentiable functions in several variables
Let A ⊆Rn, n ≥2, be an open set. If a function f : A →R is diﬀerentiable at every point x ∈A, we
call it diﬀerentiable in A, or just diﬀerentiable.
If f : A →R is diﬀerentiable at x ∈A, i.e.
f(x + h) −f(x) = a · h + ε(h)h,
then the vector a is uniquely determined at x. In fact, assume that also
f(x + h) −f(x) = a1 · h + ε(h)h.
Then by subtraction,
0 = (a −a1) · h + ε(h)h.
Choosing h = λ (a −a1), we get
0 = λ a −a12 + ε (λ (a −a1)) · |λ| a −a1 ,
where the latter term tends faster towards 0 than λ for λ →0. This is only possible, if a −a12 = 0,
and we conclude that a1 = a, and the uniqueness of a is proved.
In general, the vector a depends on x ∈A, so a = a(x) is a vector ﬁeld. We call it the gradient of f
and denote it by
a = grad f(x) = ▽f(x),
where “▽” reads “nabla”.
Remark. In the 1800s, when the gradient was introduced, the mathematicians needed a name for its
shorthand notation ▽. At that time one had just started the excavations of ruins in the Middle East,
and Assyrian became fashionable. The inverted triangle ▽resembled an Assyrian harp as shown on
the bas reliefs, and its name in Assyrian was “nabla” as read on the cuneiform tablets. ♦
The gradient is therefore deﬁned by the increase of the function in the following way,
∆f
=
f(x + x)
=
h · ▽f(x) + ε(h)h,
where ε(h) →0 for h →0.
Here we should strictly speaking more correctly write ε(x, h), because this ε-function also depends
on the point x ∈A. However, we shall only consider it for ﬁxed x ∈A, so we leave out the x in the
notation.
The linear part of the increase ∆f of the function is called the diﬀerential of f and denoted df. When
the domain A of f is open in Rn, then the diﬀerential is a function in 2n variables. More speciﬁc,
df(x, h) = h · ▽f(x).
We note that if n = 1, then ▽f(x) = f ′(x), so the gradient is equal to the diﬀerential quotient in this
case. Furthermore, its diﬀerential is (in one variable)
df(x, h) = f ′(x) h = ▽f(x) h,
so the gradient ▽f in n-dimensional space is a replacement of the derivative f ′(x), when n = 1.
This extension ▽f, inherits the same rules of computation as the derivative f ′. We mention the
following, where we assume that A ⊆Rn is open:

Differentiable functions in several variables
1) Let α, β be constants, and f, g : A →R diﬀerential functions. Then
▽(αf + βg) = α ▽f + β ▽g.
2) If f, g : A →R are diﬀerentiable functions, then
▽(fg) = f ▽g + g ▽f.
3) If α is a constant, then
▽α = 0.
These rules of computation are proved in the same way as for the derivative of functions in one
variable.
In order to become familiar with a new concept it is customary in practice always to start by consid-
ering polynomials of ﬁrst and second degree in the coordinates.
1) A polynomial of ﬁrst degree in the rectangular coordinates is written
f(x) = a + b · x,
for x ∈Rn,
where a ∈R is a constant, and b ∈Rn \ {0} is a constant vector. The increase of the function is
written
∆f := f(x + h) −f(x) = a + b · (x + h) −a −b · x = b · h,
so we only get the linear term in h and no ε-function. We conclude that
▽f = b
and
df(x, h) = b · h.
We mention the special case, when n = 2, in which case we have
f(x, y) = a + bx + ct
and
▽f(x, y) = (b, c).
2) Then we consider a special polynomial of second degree in the coordinates, namely
f(x) = x · x
for x ∈Rn.
The increase is here
∆f
=
f(x + h) −f(x) = (x + h) · (x + h) −x · x
=
x · x + 2h · x + h · h −x · x = 2x · h + h2.
Since ε(hh = h2, we see that ε(h) = h →0 for h →0, so
▽f = 2x
and
df(x, h) = 2x · h.
When n = 2 we have
f(x, y) = x2 + y2
and
▽f(x, y) = (2x, 2y).
Concerning applications in Physics we here just mention that the gradient enters Fourier’s law
q = −λ ▽T,
where q denotes the density of the heat ﬂow, and T is the temperature, and λ is the constant of the
heat conductivity.
We ﬁnd the same mathematical structure in Fick’s ﬁrst law of diﬀusion, and in Ohm’s law for an
electric current.

9.1.2
Partial derivatives
We derived previously a vector ﬁeld, the gradient ▽f, of a diﬀerentiable function. We shall next ﬁnd
the coordinates of this gradient.
As usual, let the domain A ⊆Rn of f be an open set. Choose a (ﬁxed) point x = (x1, . . . , xn) ∈A,
and introduce the auxiliary function
f1(t) := f (t, x2, . . . , xn) .
If f1 is diﬀerentiable for t = x1, we call its derivative f ′
1 (x1) the partial derivative of f(x) with respect
to the ﬁrst variable x1. More speciﬁcally,
f ′
1 (x1) = lim
h→0
f1 (x1 + h) −f1 (x1)
h
= lim
h→0
f (x1 + h, x2, . . . , xn) −f (x1, x2, . . . , xn)
h
.
In this construction we have conﬁned h to the special vectors of the form h = (h, 0, . . . , 0), in which
case the problem of taking the limit has become 1-dimensional, so we can use (9.1), known from high
school.
Even if the partial derivative of f exists with respect to x1, we cannot be sure that the function f
itself is diﬀerentiable. Let us for the time being assume that f is diﬀerentiable at x. Then the ﬁrst
coordinate of ▽f at x is indeed the partial derivative f ′
1(x) introduced above.

In fact, let h = (h, 0, . . . , 0). Then
f1 (x1 + h) −f1 (x1)
=
f (x1 + h, x2, . . . , xn) −f (x1, x2, . . . , xn)
=
(h, 0, . . . , 0) · ▽f(x) + ε(h)h = h · {(▽f(x))1 + ε(h)},
where (▽f(x))1 denotes the ﬁrst rectangular coordinate of ▽f(x). When h →0, then it follows that
the auxiliary function f1 is diﬀerentiable at t = x1, and its derivative is the ﬁrst coordinate (▽f(x))1
of the gradient at x, and we have proved that
f ′
1 (x1) = (▽f(x))1 = ▽f(x) · e1.
An analogous analysis gives us the partial derivative of f with respect to the j-th coordinate xj, for
j = (1), 2, . . . , n.
We shall of course not use the auxiliary function f ′
j (x1) as our notation for the partial derivative of
f with respect to xj. Instead we write one of the following possibilities,
f ′
xj(x),
∂f
∂xj
(x),
Djf(x).
We shall often leave out the variable x and just write
f ′
xj,
∂f
∂xj
or
Djf.
In the frequently considered case of R3, i.e. when n = 3, we usually write
f ′
x, f ′
y, f ′
z,
or
∂f
∂x, ∂f
∂y , ∂f
∂z ,
or
Dxf Dyf, Dzf.
Similarly for n = 2, where the z-coordinate does not appear.
Since the coordinates of the gradient are the partial derivatives, we immediately get
Theorem 9.1 Let A ⊆Rn be an open set. Assume that f : A →R is diﬀerentiable. Then all its
partial derivatives exist, and the gradient is given by
▽f =
 ∂f
∂x1
, . . . , ∂f
∂xn

.
It follows from Theorem 9.1 that when f is diﬀerentiable (and thus the gradient exists), then the
gradient is unique.
On the other hand, one must be aware of strange phenomena like all partial
derivatives of f exist at a point, and yet f is not diﬀerentiable, so the gradient does not exist. A
simple illustrative example is given by the function
f(x, y) =





xy
x2 + y2 ,
(x, y) = (0, 0),
0,
(x, y) = (0, 0).
We have in Chapter 2 shown that f(x, y) is not continuous at (0, 0). If one has forgotten this, just
restrict the function to the line y = 2x, x = 0, on which f(x, 2x) = 1 →1 = 0 for x →0. The function
f has nevertheless partial derivatives at (0, 0), because the restriction to the x-axis is
f(x, 0) = 0
for all x ∈R,
with ∂f
∂x(0, 0) = 0,

Differentiable functions in several variables
and the restriction to the y-axis is
f(0, y) = 0
for all y ∈R,
with ∂f
∂y (0, 0) = 0.
In order to obtain a positive result we mention without the long proof (it consists of two pages) of the
following theorem.
Theorem 9.2 Let A ⊆Rn be open, and let f : A →R be a given function. Assume that all the
partial derivatives of f exist in a whole neighbourhood of x ∈A and are all continuous, (this means
that we can ﬁnd an open ball B(x, r) ⊆A, in which all derivatives of f exist and are continuous) then
f is even diﬀerentiable at x.
In most cases we prove the diﬀerentiability of a function f by applying Theorem 9.2 in the following
way: First we calculate all the partial derivatives in a neighbourhood of the given point x ∈A, and
then we show that they are all continuous.
It is of course not hard to show that the continuity of the partial derivatives fail in the case of the
function
f(x, y) =





xy
x2 + y2 ,
(x, y) = (0, 0),
0,
(x, y) = (0, 0).
The following theorem is a generalization of a well-known result from the theory of real functions in
one variable, namely that if f is diﬀerentiable, and f ′ is zero everywhere in an interval, then f is a
constant. The trick in the proof is to use this 1-dimensional theorem repeatedly.
Theorem 9.3 Given an open domain A in Rn, and assume that f : A →R is diﬀerentiable of
gradient ▽f = 0 everywhere in A. Then f is constant in A.
Sketch of proof. First note that the gradient in the formulation of Theorem 9.3 is used as a
shorthand for the generalization of the derivative in one dimension. In order to apply the corresponding
theorem in one dimension we of course use the partial derivatives instead. We shall use that since the
open domain A is open and connected, we can to any two points a, b ∈A ﬁnd a step line connecting
them. This is a continuous curve lying totally in A with a as starting point and b as ﬁnal point
and consisting only of axiparallel line segments, on each of which just one coordinate varies. We can
exploit this, because then we can locally formulate the problem by the partial derivative with respect
to this variable.
The gradient was assumed to be 0 everywhere in A, i.e. ▽f = 0.
Then along each of the afore
mentioned axiparallel line segments, the restriction f1 of f is an ordinary function in one variable, for
which f ′
1 = 0. It follows from the 1-dimensional result that f1 is constant on this line segment. This is
true for all axiparallel line segments of the step line, and as f is also continuous, then constant must
be the same on all line segments. In particular, f(a) = f(b). As a, b ∈A were chosen arbitrarily, we
ﬁnally conclude that f is constant on A. □

Differentiable functions in several variables
We here add the proof of the result that if f, g : A →R are both diﬀerentiable, then
▽(fg) = f ▽g + g ▽f.
When we look at each coordinate separately, the proof is straightforward. In fact,
(▽(fg))j := ∂(fg)
∂xj
= f ∂g
∂xj
+ g ∂f
∂xj
= f(▽g)j + g(▽f)j = (f ▽g + g ▽f)j,
where the lower index j indicates the j-th coordinate.
We include an important observation on functions deﬁned by an integral of variable upper and lower
bounds and with an extra variable in the integrand which in the integration process is considered as
a parameter for the time being. Let us for example consider the following integral
G(x, y, z) =
 y
z
f(t, x) dt,
which will illustrate the principle. We shall often in the following volumes meet such functions, so
that is why we here premise a remark to the eﬀect that they will be at hand later on, when they are
needed.
Assume that the integrand f is continuous. Then it has an antiderivative F(t, x), which satisﬁes
F ′
t(t, x) = f(t, x).
Then we use the main theorem of diﬀerential and integration calculus in one
variable to get
G(x, y, z) = F(y, x) −F(z, x).
We then turn to the problem of ﬁnding ▽G. Clearly, y and z are the easy variables, because the
partial derivatives are straightforward,
G′
y(x, y, z) = F ′
y(y, x) −0 = f(y, x),
G′
z(x, y, z) = 0 −F ′
z(z, x) = −f(z, x).
The variable x enters here only the integrand, so one would expect that
G′
x(x, y, z) =
 y
z
f ′
x(t, x) dt.
This is true, if we furthermore assume that the partial derivative f ′
x of the integrand is continuous! So
when both f(t, x) and f ′
x(t, x) are continuous, the gradient of G(x, y, z) given as the integral above is
▽G =
 y
z
f ′
x(t, x) dt, f(y, x), −f(z, x)

.
Remark 9.1 We have of course here chosen a purely mathematical notation. In the applications
in e.g. Physics this notation may sometimes be ambiguous, so one is forced to modify the notation
in order to make it more precise. Let us consider a thermodynamic system. In this we have the
following possible variables, the volume V , the pressure p, the temperature T and the entropy S. The
ambiguity of the previous notation occurs because the system is totally described by just two of these
four variables. This means that a notation like ∂V
∂p is not unique, unless one also makes it precise, if the

state of the system is determined by (p, T ), or by (p, S). One usually adds an index, like for instance

∂V

T , or

∂V
∂p

S, resp.. Here,

∂V
∂p

T means the partial derivative of the volume with respect to
the pressure, provided that the temperature T is kept constant. Similarly,

∂V
∂p

S means that the
entropy is kept constant. This change of notation makes it easier in Thermodynamics to formulate
many results than if we instead had only used the pure mathematical notation. We mention here the
so-called Maxwell relation, which in the physical notation becomes
∂T
∂p

p
=
∂V
∂S

p
.
The reader can easily imagine the problems in only using the mathematical notations, because then
we had to add a comment on that the entropy S is kept constant on the left hand side of the equation,
while we on the right hand side of the equation instead keep the pressure ﬁxed. ♦

Diﬀerentiable vector functions
A vector function f : A →Rm, where A ⊆Rn, is called diﬀerentiable, if all its coordinate functions
are diﬀerentiable. This means more precisely that
fi(x + h) −fi(x) = h · ▽fi(x) + εi(h)h,
where ε(h) →0 for h →0,
for i = 1, . . . , m.
Combining all coordinates we have
f(x + h) −f(x) = (h · ▽)f(x) + ε(h)h,
where ε(h) →0
for h →0.
We deﬁne the diﬀerential of the vector function,
df(x, h) = (h · ▽)f(x),
by all its coordinates,
(h · ▽)f(x) = (h · ▽f1(x), . . . , h · ▽fm(x)) = ( df1(x), . . . , dfm(x)) .
If we here choose f as the identity map, i.e. f(x) := x, then f(x + h) −f(x) = h, so the diﬀerential
becomes
df(x, h) = h.
When we write x instead of f we get the strictly speaking incorrect, though very practical notation,
namely dx = h, and hence in general,
df = dx · ▽f
in one dimension,
df = ( dx · ▽)f
in several dimensions.
All information on the mn partial derivatives of f is collected in the so-called functional matrix D f,
which is deﬁned by
D f(x) :=






∂f1

,
and we get by using some Linear Algebra that the diﬀerential can be written as a matrix product,
df(x, h) = (D f(x)) h,
or for short df = (D f) h,
where h should be written as an (n × 1)-column.

The approximating polynomial of degree 1
Let us return to the deﬁnition of the diﬀerentiability of a function f : A →R, i.e.
f(x) = f (x0) + (x −x0) · ▽f (x0) + ε (x −x0) x −x0 ,
where x0 ∈A is the chosen point, and where we have written the increment as h = x −x0. Since
ε (x −x0) →0 for x →x0, it follows that the approximation by a polynomial of degree 1 in a
neighbourhood of x0 ∈A is given by
f(x) ≃P1(x),
where we have deﬁned
P1(x) := f (x0) + (x −x0) · ▽f (x0) .
We call this P1(x) the approximating polynomial of at most degree 1 of the function f at the point of
expansion x0.
Remark 9.2 It is important to keep the variable in the form x −x0 = (x1 −x01, . . . , xn −x0n), and
not to reduce it to a function in x alone. The reason is that we in the applications only use the
approximating polynomial in the neighbourhood of x0, where x −x0 is small. ♦
We mention for later references the structures of the approximating polynomials for n = 2 and n = 3,
P1(x, y) = f (x0, y0) + f ′
x (x0, y0) (x −x0) + f ′
y (x0, y0) (y −y0) ,
for n = 2,
P1(x, y, z)
=
f (x0, y0, z0) + f ′
x (x0, y0, z0) (x −x0) + f (x0, y0, z0) + f ′
y (x0, y0, z0) (y −y0)
+f (x0, y0, z0) + f ′
z (x0, y0, z0) (z −z0) ,
for n = 3.
As a simple application we consider the function f(x, y) in two variables given by
f(x, y) = exp

x2 −y2
for (x, y) ∈R2,
where we shall ﬁnd the approximating polynomial of degree 1 derived from the point of expansion
(x0, y0) = (1, −1).
We ﬁrst calculate
f ′
x(x, y) = 2x exp

x2 −y2
and
f ′
y(x, y) = −2y exp

x2 −y2
.
Then we compute all the necessary constants,
f(1, −1) = 1,
f ′
x(1, −1) = 2,
f ′
y(1, −1) = 2.
By insertion the approximating polynomial becomes
P1(x, y) = 1 + 2(x −1) + 2(y + 1),
which is reasonable useful, when (x −1, y + 1) is small. As an example we get
P1(0.95, −1.02) = 0.86,
in comparison with f(0.95, −1.02) = 0.87118 · · · .
If we instead “reduce” P1(x, y) to a polynomial in (x, y), then we use (0, 0) as expansion point for an
approximation, which is only reasonable at a point (1, −1) far away. The result P1(x, y) = 1+2x+ 2y
looks of course nicer, but we lose the important information that it can only be used for (x −1, y + 1)
small. Therefore: Always keep the variable in the form x −x0, where x0 is the point of expansion.

The chain rule
9.2.1
The elementary chain rule
As usual we start with the 1-dimensional case in order to ﬁnd out in what direction we should go,
when we generalize to the case of higher dimensions.
The elementary chain rule. Let f : A →R and X : B →A be two diﬀerentiable functions, each
in one variable. Then the composite function F := f ◦X : B →R is also diﬀerentiable, and
dF
du = df
dx(X(u)) dX
du (u),
which is also written
F ′(u) = f ′(X(u))X′(u).
Figure 9.1: The elementary chain rule. The composite function is F = f ◦X : B →R (the tree to the
left), so ﬁrst we map u ∈B into x = X(u) ∈A, which is then mapped into
f(x) = f(X(u)) = (f ◦X)(u).
To the right we have indicated the three levels. We shall diﬀerentiate f on the highest level with
respect to u ∈B on the lowest level, through x ∈A in the middle level.
Proof. Obviously, the composite function F := f ◦X : B →R is well-deﬁned. We shall prove that
it is also diﬀerentiable.
Let u0 ∈B. Then x0 = X (u0) ∈A, and we can ﬁnd an open neighbourhood B1 ⊆B of u0, such that
x = X(u) ∈A for all u ∈B1. We may of course in the following assume that B1 = B.
Let ∆u denote an increment of u ∈B, such that also u + ∆u ∈B. We have assumed that X is
diﬀerentiable, so
X(u + ∆u) −X(u) := ∆X →0
for ∆u →0 and u, u + ∆u ∈B,

Figure 9.2: The general scheme of the chain rule. We shall diﬀerentiate the vector function f at the
highest level with respect to u on the lowest level via x on the middle level. Only the middle level x
will be in contact with both the upper level f and the lower level u.
and also
∆X
∆u →X′(u)
for ∆u →0,
which can be written in the form (after a rearrangement)
X(u + ∆u) = X(u) + X′(u)∆u + ε(∆u)∆u,
where ε(∆u) →0 for ∆u →0.
We also assumed that the function f is diﬀerentiable in A, so
f(x + ∆x) −f(x) := ∆f →0
for ∆x →0 and x + ∆x ∈A,
and
∆f
∆x →f ′(x)
for ∆x →0,
and
f(x + ∆x) = f(x) + f ′(x)∆x + ε(∆x)∆x.

and the elementary chain rule is proved. □
We shall in the following generalize this elementary chain rule to the higher dimensional case as
described schematically on Figure 9.2. We still keep the arrows, but later we shall exclude them,
because we shall always calculate the derivatives from below, i.e. in the upward direction. First we
note that the vector function f(x) is a function of the vector x, which again is a function of the vector
u. Clearly, at head on approach is doomed to fail, so we shall ﬁrst analyze a couple of simpler cases,
before we show the chain rule in general. The chain rule may at the ﬁrst glance seem very technical.
It is, however, important in the practical applications.

The ﬁrst special case
We ﬁrst consider the case where m = k = 1 and n > 1. In the following we shall only consider the
trees to the right in Figure 9.1 and Figure 9.2.
Figure 9.3: The chain rule in the ﬁrst special case. The subtree, where we only diﬀerentiate with
respect to one variable uj is shown to the right.
When we conﬁne ourselves to the partial derivatives of the composite function with respect to uj,
it follows from the tree at the right hand side of Figure 9.3 that when all the other u-variables are
considered as parameters, then we have reduced the problem to the elementary case of the one-
dimensional chain rule, so if we write F = f ◦X, we get
∂F
∂uj
(u) = df
dx(X(u)) ∂X

(u),
for j = 1, . . . , n.
Collecting all the coordinate functions in one equation, we get the following
First special case of the chain rule. If f : A →R, where A ⊆R, and X : B →A, where B ⊆Rn,
and F = f ◦X : B →R, then
F(u) = f(X(u))
and
▽F(u) = f ′(X(u)) ▽X(u).

When F(u) = f(u) and u = 0, we get by the chain rule above that

In other words, the gradient of F is in this special case equal to the derivative f ′ of f, multiplied by
a unit vector, which is directed away from origo.
9.2.3
The second special case
This case is also easy. We choose m > 1 and k = n = 1, so we get the tree on Figure 9.4.
Figure 9.4: The chain rule in the second special case. The subtree, where we only diﬀerentiate one
function fj is shown to the right.
The j-th coordinate function Fj(u) = fj(X(u)) is diﬀerentiated in the following way, according to the
elementary chain rule,
dFj
du (u) = dfj
dx (X(u)) dX
du (u),
for j = 1, . . . , m.
Putting all coordinate functions together we obtain:
Second special case of the chain rule. If f : A →Rm, where A ⊆R, and X : B →A, where
B ⊆R, and F = f ◦X : B →R, then
F(u) = f(X(u))

F′(u) = f ′(X(u)).

The third special case
This is the most complicated special case, where k > 1, while m = n = 1. The tree is shown to the
left of Figure 9.5 with the general case to the left, and the special case of k = 2 to the right.
Figure 9.5: The chain rule in the third special case. The subtree, where we only have two variables,
x and y, is shown to the right.
In order to avoid a mess of indices in the proof we shall only prove this special case for k = 2, where
we use (x, y) instead of (x1, x2). We shall therefore consider the composite function
F(u) = f(X(u), Y (u)).
Once the chain rule has been proved in this special case, it is easy to generalize.
Before we prove the chain rule in this case, we make some preparations. If the variable u is given an
increment ∆u, then we put
X(u + ∆u) := X(u) + ∆X
and
Y (u + ∆u) := Y (u) + ∆Y.
We assume of course that X(u) and Y (u) are diﬀerentiable, so
∆X →0
and
∆Y →0
for ∆u →0,
and
∆X
∆u →X′(u)
and
∆Y
∆u →Y ′(u)
for ∆u →0.
Furthermore, we assume that the function f is diﬀerentiable at the point (x, y). This means that
f(x+∆x, y+∆y) = f(x, y) + f ′
x(x, y)∆x + f ′
y(x, y)∆y + ε(∆x, ∆y)

(Deltax)2+(∆y)2,
where ε(∆x, ∆y) →0 for (∆x, ∆y) →(0, 0), i.e. for

(∆x)2 + (∆y)2 →0.
Then we have to put all things together, so we shall compute the diﬀerential quotient of the composite
function F(u) = F(X(u), Y (u)) and use the above to reformulate this expression.

Differentiable functions in several variables
Summing up, we have proved the chain rule for k = 2 and m = n = 1:
Third special case of the chain rule for k = 2. If f : A →R, where A ⊆R2, and (X, Y ) : B →A,
where B ⊆R, and F = f ◦(X, Y ) : B →R, then
F(u) = f(X(u), Y (u))
and
F ′(u) =

f ′
x(x, y)X′(u) + f ′
y(x, y)Y ′(u)

x=X(u), y=Y (u) .
In practice we ﬁrst compute the partial derivatives f ′
x(x, y) and f ′
y(x, y), and then the ordinary deriva-
tives X′(u) and Y ′(u), for ﬁnally to insert x = X(u) and y = Y (u). A short way of writing this formula
is
dF
du = ∂f
∂x
dx
du + ∂f
∂y

du.
This version of the chain rule is often used, when the function which should be diﬀerentiated, is fairly
complicated. We illustrate this by considering the function
F(u) = Arctan

eu −sin u
eu + sin u

,
for u ∈R.
The trick is to write F(u) = f(X(u), Y (u)) as a composite function. Here one would choose
f(x, y) = Arctan
x

for (x, y) ∈R2
+,
and
X(u) = eu −sin u
and
Y (u) = eu + sin u
for u ∈R.
(Note that X(u), Y (u) > 0 for u ∈R.)
Then

while
X′(u) = eu −cos u
and
Y ′(u) = eu + cos u.
By insertion of X(u) = eu −sin u and Y (u) = eu + sin u we get
f ′
x(x, y) =

which clearly needs to be reduced.
Without going into details we mention that if k > 2, then we just copy the proof above to get
Third special case of the chain rule for k > 2. If f : A →R, where A ⊆Rk, and X : B →A,
where B ⊆Rk, and F = f ◦X : B →R, then F(u) = f(X(u)), and
F ′(u) =

x1(x)X′
1(u) + · · · + f ′
xk(x)X′
k(u)

x=X(u) = ▽f(X(u)) · X′(u).
The latter equation follows from that the ﬁrst result actually is a scalar product.
An important application occurs, when we shall diﬀerentiate a function, which is given by an integral,
in which the upper and lower bounds are diﬀerentiable functions in the variable under consideration,
as well as the integrand. Let us consider
g(x) =
 Y (x)
Z(x)
f(t, x) dt,
x ∈I,
where I is an interval. We deﬁne a function G(x, y, z) in three variables by
G(x, y, z) :=
 y
z
f(t, x) dt,
and then note that
g(x) = G(x, Y (x), Z(x)).
We have previously found that
G′
x(x, y, z) =
 y
z
f ′
x(t, z) dt,
G′
y(x, y, z) = f(y, x),
G′
z(x, y, z) = −f(z, x),
so we get by the chain rule for k = 3 and m = n = 1 and X(x) = x, that
dg
dx
=
∂G
∂x · dX
dx + ∂G
∂y · dY
dx + ∂G
∂z · dZ
dx
=
 Y (x)
Z(x)
f ′
x(t, x) dt + f(Y (x), x)Y ′(x) −f(Z(x), x)Z′(x).
This rule is valid, when the functions f, f ′
x, Y ′ and Z′ are all continuous.

The general chain rule
In the general case we have the situation as described on Figure 9.6. By ﬁxing the index r ∈{1, . . . , m}
in the upper layer and j ∈{1, . . ., n} in the lower layer we reduce the complicated scheme of Figure 9.6
to Figure 9.7, which we recognize as the diagram for the third special case of the chain rule in
Section 9.2.4. Therefore, the general chain rule follows by gluing all cases together of r ∈{1, . . . , m}
and j ∈{1, . . ., n}.

If we use the functional matrix diﬀerential operator D deﬁned by
Df =

r=1,...,m;j=1,...,n
,
then the general chain rule can also be written in the following matrix notation,
D(f ◦X)(u) = Df(X(u))DX(u).
Clearly, all the previously obtained special cases are obtained by putting (at least) two of the numbers
m, k, n equal to 1 (and trivially replace “∂” by “ d”, when we have got only one variable.
A frequent application consists in the change from rectangular coordinates in the plane to polar
coordinates. So given the function f : A →R, where A ⊆R2, we shall consider partial diﬀerentiations
with respect to the polar coordinates (̺, ̺) of
F(̺, ϕ) = f(x, y) = f(̺ cos ϕ, ̺ sin ϕ).

∂F
∂ϕ = −∂f

∂y ̺ cos ϕ,
where we ﬁrst diﬀerentiate f with respect to x and y, and then insert x = ̺ cos ϕ, y = ̺ sin ϕ into the
result.
This is an example of the general principle in practical applications. We shall usually not bother with
whether we are considering f or F, and we shall usually in the ﬁrst calculation leave out the variables.
The method is that we diﬀerentiate through all variables on the middle level and ﬁnally add all these
results,

where the blue variables from the middle level are added,
Note that the symbol of a partial diﬀerential quotient is a notation and not a fraction, so one cannot
just cancel all the blue contributions. An furthermore, in the ﬁnal result, only the variables u (and
not x) should occur.

Directional derivative
We shall sometimes need the derivative of a function f(x) in a speciﬁc direction from a given point x.
Let e be a unit vector starting at the point x and pointing in the direction, in which we want to ﬁnd
the derivative. Take the restriction of f to a line segment through x in the direction e, i.e. we deﬁne
F(t) = f(x + te),
for t ∈I,
where I ⊆R is some open interval, for which 0 ∈I. Then F(t), t ∈I, is an ordinary function in t,
while the right hand side f(x + te) is a composite function,
F = f ◦X,
where X(t) = x + te = (x1 + te1, . . . , xn + ten) .
Then by the chain rule,
F ′(t) = ∂f
∂x1
dx1
dt + · · · + ∂f
∂xn
dxn
dt = ▽f(x) · X′(t) = e · ▽f(x + te).
Consider in particular F ′(0). The interpretation of F ′(0) is that it gives a measure of the variation
of f, when one moves a small distance from x in the direction of e. We call F ′(0) the directional
derivative of f in the direction of e, and we shall use the notation
f ′(x, e) (= F ′(0)) = e · ▽f(x).
Since e is a unit vector, we clearly have the inequalities
− ▽f(x) ≤f ′(x, e) ≤ ▽f(x).
We obtain equality to the left, when e is pointing in the opposite direction of ▽f(x), and similarly
equality to the right, when the unit vector e points in the same direction as ▽f(x. In particular, the
gradient ▽f(x is pointing in the direction from the point x, in which the function f(x) obtains its
biggest increase.
If the unit vector e is chosen as one of the vectors of the orthonormal basis, ej, then the directional
derivative is equal to the partial derivative with respect to xj, i.e.
∂f
∂xj
= ej · ▽f(x),
which we have also seen previously.
We mention in this connection a slightly diﬀerent problem, the solution of which is derived from the
above. Given two diﬀerent points x0, x1 ∈A. We shall ﬁnd the directional derivative of f(x) in the
direction from x0 towards x1.
We shall only ﬁnd the unit vector, which points from x0 towards x1. This is clearly
e :=
x1 −x0
x1 −x0,
so the directional derivative of f at x0 in the direction from x0 towards x1 is given by
x1 −x0
|x1 −x0 · ▽f (x0) .

Cn-functions
We have previously introduced the partial derivatives of ﬁrst order
∂f
∂x1
, . . . , ∂f
∂xk
of a function f : A →R, where A ⊆Rk, whenever they do exist. One may be tempted to check if
these (at most) k partial derivatives of ﬁrst order again are diﬀerentiable functions with respect to
the variables x = (x1, . . . , xk). When this is the case, we call the results partial derivatives of second
order.
Assume that ∂f
∂xi
has a partial derivative with respect to the variable xj. We shall then use one of
the following notations for this partial derivative of second order:
∂
∂xj
 ∂f
∂xi
(x)

,
∂2f
∂xj∂xi
(x),
f ′′
xixj,
or
DjDif(x).
The symbol closest to the function f is always applied ﬁrst. However, we mention that some authors
prefer to write in the opposite order
∂2f
∂xi∂xj
(x),
so here the order of diﬀerentiation follows the way this symbol is read. In practice this will not cause
any trouble, because we shall see in the following that under very mild assumptions, which are always
met in the rest of this series of books, we have
∂2f
∂xi∂xj
=
∂2f
∂xj∂xi
,
no matter which interpretation we have chosen.
If xj = xi, we also write
∂2f
∂x2
i
(x),
or
f ′′
x2
i (x).
or
D2
i f(x)
for the corresponding partial derivative of second order.
The extension from partial derivatives of order 1 to partial derivatives of order 2 is the biggest one.
Once we have understood this step, it is obvious how to introduce partial derivatives of order n,
whenever they exist. Also, the notation of the partial derivatives of order n,
∂n
∂xi1 · · · ∂xin
(x),
f (n)
xin···xi1 (x),
or
Di1 · · · Dinf(x),
is easy to understand.
When the dimensions are n = 2 or 3, then we use the notation (x, y) or (x, y, z) for the variables,
instead of (x1, x2) or (x1, x2, x3).
Assume that all possible partial derivatives of f of order n exist in A and that they are all continuous
in A. Then we say that f has continuous partial derivatives of order n in A, and we write
f ∈Cn(A).

Differentiable functions in several variables
When this is true for all n, we write f ∈C∞(A). Then it is natural to add f ∈C0(A) to mean that
f is continuous in A.
Often the open domain A is tacitly understood, in which case we just write f ∈Cn, or f ∈C∞, or
f ∈C0.
The importance of the class Cn(A) follows from the following theorem,
Theorem 9.4 Interchange of the order of diﬀerentiation. Assume that A ⊆Rkk is open and that
f ∈C2(A). Then
∂2f
∂xi∂xj
(x) =
∂2f
∂xj∂xi
(x)
for x ∈A and i, j ∈{1, . . ., k}.
Theorem 9.4 is only formulated for n = 2, but if e.g. f ∈C3(A), then every ∂f
∂xi
∈C2(A), and we
may apply Theorem 9.4 with f replaced by ∂f
∂xi
, and then use induction to obtain the general result.
The proof of Theorem 9.4 is fairly long and tedious, for which reason it is not given here.

The formulation of Theorem 9.4 above gives us a hint of that there may exist examples of functions,
for which the partial derivatives of e.g. second order exist, and yet there may exist points in which
the order of diﬀerentiation is essential. This is indeed true! Let f : R2 →R2 be given by
f(x, y) =

(x2 + 2(x + y)2) (y2 + (x −y)2) =

3x4 −2x3y + 4xy3 + 4y4.
If (x, y) = (0, 0), then
f ′
x(x, y) =
6x3 −3x2y + 2y3

3x4 −2x3y + 4xy3 + 4y4 ,
f ′
y(x, y) =
−x3 + 6xy2 + 8y3

3x4 −2x3y + 4xy3 + 4y4 .
It follows that even f ∈C∞
R2 \ {(0, 0)}

, so we shall only investigate the point (0, 0). We get in
particular from the above,
f ′
x(0, y) = y
for y = 0,
and
f ′
y(x, 0) = −x
√
3
for x = 0,
Since we have the restriction f(x, 0) =
√
3 x2 for x ∈R, we get f ′
x(x, 0) = 2
√
3 x, hence
f ′
x(0, 0) = 0,
Since we have the restriction f(0, y) = 2y2 for y ∈R, we get f ′
y(0, y) = 4y, hence
f ′
y(0, 0) = 0.
Summing up, we have
f ′
x(0, y) = y
for y ∈R,
and
f ′
y(x, 0) = −x
√
3
for x ∈R,
from which we get
f ′′
xy(0, y) = 1
for y ∈R
and
f ′′
yx(x, 0) = −1
√
3
for x ∈R.
Then
f ′′
xy(0, 0) = 1 = −1
√
3 = f ′′
yx(0, 0),
proving that the order of diﬀerentiation cannot be interchanged at the point (0, 0), although the partial
derivatives of second order clearly exist in all of R2.
We have above only considered the class Cn(A), when A was an open set. In many applications we
also need to talk of Cn( ˜A), when ˜A is not open. We introduce the following
Deﬁnition 9.2 Let A ⊆Rk be a nonempty set, and let f : A →R be a function. We say that
f ∈Cn(A) is n times continuously diﬀerentiable in A, if there exists an extension ˜f : ˜A →R of f to
an open set ˜A, such that ˜f ∈Cn( ˜A) and ˜f(x) = f(x) for all x ∈A.
If f : A →Rm is a vector function, we say that f ∈Cn(A), if all its coordinate functions fi ∈Cn(A).

Taylor’s formula
9.5.1
Taylor’s formula in one dimension
We shall often need a method to approximate a Cn-function in a neighbourhood of a point, using a
polynomial as approximation. There are some possibilities, of which we here choose the most well-
known, namely Taylor’s formula. As usual we shall start with the 1-dimensional case and then derive
the general results in n dimensions.
Usually one uses Rolle’s theorem or the mean value theorem to prove Taylor’s formula, but as we
shall see below, this is not necessary, if we only assume that the function is n times continuously
diﬀerentiable.
Let I ⊆R be an open interval, which contains 0 ∈I, and let F : I →R be a Cn(I)-function. This
means that
F(t), F ′(t), . . . , F (n)(t),
t ∈I,
all exist and are continuous. In particular, in a neighbourhood of 0 ∈I,
F (n)(t) = F (n)(0) + ε(t),
where ε(t) →0 for t →0,
a relation which we shall need below.
Another preparation for the proof is the following observation that by a partial integration for h ∈I,
 h

 h

F (k+1)(t) dt
for k = 1, . . . , n −1,
because F ∈Cn(I).
Using this result repeatedly we obtain by induction

is a polynomial of at most degree n in h. We call it the approximating polynomial of F(h) of degree
at most n, and n, which is determined by the corresponding remainder term above, is called the order
of expansion.
Note that we may have come across an expansion of order n, where the approximating polynomial
actually is of degree < n. The only requirement is that F (n)(0) = 0, a possibility, which cannot be
excluded.
If the point of expansion is not 0, but instead some t0 ∈I, then we just introduce the new variable
τ = t −t0, and the point of expansion for τ becomes τ0 = 0, and we can use the above to get
F(t) = F (t0) + F ′ (t0)

where F ∈Cn(I), and where ε (t −t0) →0 for t →t0.
Before we in detail discuss Taylor’s formula in several variables we show, how we get from the one
dimensional version above to Taylor’s formula in n dimensions. The idea is simple. Let f : A →R,
where A ⊂Rk is open, be a Cn-function. Let x ∈A, and let x + h ∈A be a neighbouring point, such
that the (closed) line segment between x and x + h lies in A. If h = 0, put h = he, where h > 0 and
e is a unit vector. We deﬁne
(9.3)
F(t) := f(x + te),
for t ∈I,
where I is an open interval containing [0, h]. Then F(0) = f(x) and F(h) = f(x+he) = f(x+e), and
F(t) is a Cn(I)-function, so we can apply Taylor’s formula in one dimension om F(t), proved above.
We shall of course in the diﬀerentiation of (9.3) above use the chain rule on the right hand side. We
shall ﬁrst consider the simple case, when n = 1.

Taylor expansion of order 1

(x + te) = e · ▽f(x + te)

Put n = 1 and t = h into Taylor’s formula to get
F(h) = f(x + h) = f(x) + he · ▽f(x + te) = f(x) + h · ▽f(x) + ε(h)h,

where the ε-function depends on both the length h > 0 and the direction e, so if f ∈C1(A) and
x ∈A, then
f(x + h) = f(x) + h · ▽f(x) + ε(h)h.
This was fairly easy and only illustrates that f ∈C1(I) is continuously diﬀerentiable.
One would of course expect that the situation becomes more complicated for n > 1, and so it is! In
order to get the general idea we shall therefore in the next section conﬁne ourselves to the case where
n = 2 and just k = 2, and only brieﬂy at the end of the section mention the result, when k = 3.
9.5.3
Taylor expansion of order 2 in the plane
We shall proceed with the Taylor expansion of second order, n = 2, in several variables. We shall start
with he simplest case, where we have only two variable (x, y). Let A ⊆R2 be an open and non-empty
set in the plane, and let f ∈C2(A) be a twice continuously diﬀerentiable function of A. We shall ﬁnd
for a given point (x, y) ∈A and a small increment (hx, hy) an expression of f (x + hx, y + hy) in a
neighbouring point (x + hx, y + hy), where we use f and its ﬁrst and second partial derivatives at the
given point (x, y).
The set A is open, at (x, y) ∈A, so there exists an r > 0, such that the open disc B((x, y), r) ⊆A. If
therefore the increment (hx, hy) is small

, then the closed line segment
between (x, y) and (x + hx, y + hy) is totally contained in A, so we can take the restriction of f to
this line segment and apply the previously developed theory.

Let h :=

h2x + h2y. Then there are constants α (= cos ϕ) and β (= sin ϕ), such that
hx = α h
and
hy = β h,
and the restriction of f to the line segment is written
F(t) = f(x + α t, y + β t),
for t ∈I ⊃[0, h],
where
F(h) = f (x + hx, y + hy)
and
F(0) = f(x, y).
We get by the chain rule,
F ′(t) = α f ′
x(x + α t, y + β t) + β f ′
y(x + α t, y + β t).
The assumption that f ∈C2(A) secures that the right side of this equation is again continuously
diﬀerentiable. Hence, once more by the chain rule (third special case)

We shall see below, that this is really a convenient deﬁnition.

f1(x) = h · ▽f(x) = df(x, h),
then
d2f(x, h) = h · ▽f1(x) = (h · ▽)(h · ▽)f(x),
for f ∈C2(A).
In general, we deﬁne by induction the p-th diﬀerential of a function f ∈Cn(A) by
dpf(x, h) = h · ▽p−1(x, h) = · · · = (h · ▽)pf(x),
for p = 1, . . . , n,

so we obtain in general,

In the applications in e.g. Physics, one rarely goes beyond the order n = 2 of the expansion. Also,
the dimensions are usually k = 2 or k = 3, so we have above covered the most important cases for the
applications. And yet we have still the possibility of extending Taylor’s formula to k > 3 and n > 2,
which is of importance in the next section.
9.5.4
The approximating polynomial
Assume that f ∈Cn(A). Then by Taylor’s formula,
f(x + h) = f(x) + 1
1!(h · ▽)f(x, h) + · · · + 1
n!(h · ▽)nf(x, h) + ε(h)hn.
If we remove the remainder term ε(h)hn, we get a polynomial in h of at most degree n. We call it
the approximating polynomial of at most degree n in the variable h, i.e.
Pn(x, h) = f(x) + 1
1!(h · ▽)f(x, h) + · · · + 1
n!(h · ▽)nf(x, h)

where x is the expansion point. It is an approximation of f(x) in the neighbourhood of x, because
|f(x + h) −Pn(x), h| = ε(h)hn,
where ε(h) →0 for h →0,
i.e. the error is of the size ε(h)hn. One may write this
f(x + h) ≃Pn(x, h).
In practice we denote the expansion point by x0, and then write x = x0 + h, so the increment is
h = x −x0.
We then write
f(x) ≃Pn (x0, x −x0)
in a neighbourhood of x0.
Of particular importance are the cases, where k = 2 and k = 3, and the order of expansion is 2,
because this is the most commonly used approximations in Physics. We therefore explicitly give the
approximating polynomials of order 2 below.

Differentiable functions in several variables
Assume that A ⊆R2. Then we write the variable in the form x = (x, y). Let (x0, y0) denote the
expansion point. Then the approximal polynomial of at most degree 2 of f ∈C2(A) is given by
P2 (x0, x −x0) = P2 ((x0, y0) , (x −x0, y −y0))
= f (x0, y0) + (x −x0) f ′
x (x0, y0) + (y −y0) f ′

xy (x0, y0) + 1
2 (y −y0)2 f ′′
yy (x0, y0) .
We must for numerical reasons keep h = x −x0 and k = y −y0 as the natural variables and not
“reduce” the polynomial, using x and y as the variables.
Similarly in three dimensions, if f ∈C2(A), where A ⊆R3. In this case,
P2 (x0, x −x0) = P2 ((x0, y0, z0) , (x −x0, y −y0, z −z0))
= f (x0, y0, z0) + (x −x0) f ′

+ (z −z0) (x −x0) f ′′
zx (x0, y0, z0) ,
where we keep (x −x0, y −y0, z −z0) as our variables.
In practice the notation P2 ((x0, y0) , (x −x0, y −y0)) and P2 ((x0, y0, z0) , (x −x0, y −y0, z −z0)) are
too clumsy, so we just write P2(x, y) and P2(x, y, z) instead, where we tacitly assume the point of
expansion, (x0, y0), resp. (x0, y0, z0).
We shall below illustrate the principle in a concrete example, in which we also demonstrate an alter-
native, using results from Chapter 12. This alternative is sometimes more easy to apply.
Consider the function
f(x, y) = exp

x2 −y2

where we choose the expansion point (1, −1).

f ′′
yy(1, −1) = 2,
so the approximating polynomial in (x −1, y + 1) of at most degree 2 is

f(1, −1) + f ′
x(1, −1)(x −1) + f ′

=
1 + 2(x −1) + 2(y −1) + 3(x −1)2 + 4(x −1)(y + 1) + (y + 1)2,
where the polynomial should not be reduced further.
Second method. When (1, −1) is the expansion point, we introduce x = 1 + h and y = −1 + k,
or h = x −1 and k = y + 1, where (h, k) are the new variables, which should be kept small in the
approximations.
Then,
x2 −y2 = (1 + h)2 −(−1 + k)2 = 2h + 2k + h2 −k2,
which for small (h, k) behaves like ∼2h + 2k of ﬁrst degree, while the remainder terms
h2 −k2 = ε(h, k)

h2 + k2.
We know already, cf. Chapter 12, that

where the dots indicate terms of degree > 2, i.e. of the type ε(t)t2.
If we put t = 2h + 2k + h2 −k2, then clearly t3 = ε(h, k)

Finally, h = x −1 and k = y + 1, so
P2(x, y) = 1 + 2(x −1) + 2(y + 1) + 3(x −1)2 + 4(x −1)(y + 1) + (y + 1)2.
If we want to ﬁnd an approximation of f(0.95, −1.02) [= 0.87118 . . .], and no computer or pocket
calculator is at hand, then we use the approximate polynomial P2(x, y) with x −1 = −0.05 and
y + 1 = −0.02, and we get by insertion,
P2(0.95, −1.02) = 1 + 2(−0.5) + 2(−0.02) + 3(−0.05)2 + 4(−0.05)(−0.02) + (−0.02)2 = 0.8719,
which is a fairly good approximation of f(0.92, −1.02).
Then we consider the following case in R3,
f(x, y, z) = y ln x + z2ey
for x > 0,
where the expansion point is chosen as (1, 0, 1).
First method. We compute
f(x, yt, z) = y ln x + z2ey,
f(1, 0, 1) = 1,
f ′
x(x, y, z) = y
x,
f ′
x(1, 0, 1) = 0,
f ′
y(x, y, z) = ln x + z2ey,
f ′
y(1, 0, 1) = 1,
f ′
z(x, y, z) = 2zey,
f ′
z(1, 0, 1) = 2,
f ′′
xx(x, y, z) = −y
x2 ,
f ′′
xx(1, 0, 1) = 0,
f ′′
yy(x, y, z) = z2ey,
f ′′
yy(1, 0, 1) = 1,
f ′′
zz(x, y, z) = 2ey,
f ′′
zz = 2,
f ′′
xy(x, y, z) = 1
x,
f ′′
xy(1, 0, 1) = 1,
f ′′
yz(x, y, z) = 2zey,
f ′′
yz(1, 0, 1) = 2,
f ′′
zx(x, y, z) = 0,
f ′′
zx(1, 0, 1) = 0,
so the approximate polynomial P2(x, y, z) of at most degree 2 is
P2(x, y, z) = 1 + y + 2(z −1) + 1
2 y2 + (z −1)2 + (x −1)y + 2y(z −1).
Second method. Since the expansion point is (1, 0, 1), we put x = 1 + h, y = k and z = 1 + p. Then
f(x, y, z)
=
k ln(1 + h) + (1 + p)2ek = k{h + · · · } +

where the dots indicate terms of degree > 2. Hence,
P2(x, y, z)
=
1 + k + 2p + hk + 2kp + 1
2 k2 + p2
=
1 + y + 2(z −1) + (x −1)y + 2y(z −1) + 1
2 y2 + (z −1)2.
At last we show that even if f(x, y) is a polynomial, the approximating polynomial P2(x, y) is not
necessarily the same polynomial. If we choose
f(x, y) = x2y
for (x, y) ∈R2,
then f(x, y) is a monomial of degree 2 + 1 = 3, so one would expect that P2(x, y) would be diﬀerent
from f(x, y), no matter the point of expansion. This is obvious for the point of expansion (0, 0),
because the approximating polynomial of at most degree 2 in this case is 0. Then let us consider the
expansion point (1, 2). Then x = 1 + h and y = 2 + k, hence by insertion,
f(x, y) = x2y = (1 + h)2y =

1 + 2h + h2
(2 + k) = 2 + 4h + k + 2h2 + 2hk + h2k.
The approximation of second order is then obtained by removing all terms of degree > 2, which in
the present case is h2k, so when the expansion point is (1, 2), we get
P2(x, y) = 2 + 4h + k + 2h2 + 2hk = 2 + 4(x −1) + (y −2) + 2(x −1)2 + 2(x −1)(y −2) = x2y,
because we are missing the term h2k = (x −1)2(y −2).

Some useful procedures
10.1
Introduction
We mention two procedures, which are relevant for this book, namely The chain rule and The direc-
tional derivative. For some reason these simple procedures are felt very diﬃcult, the ﬁrst time one
meets them, so the reader should be careful here.
10.2
The chain rule
Problem 10.1 Let f = (f1, . . . , fm) be a diﬀerentiable vector function in the k real variables x1, . . . ,
xk, and assume that these again are diﬀerentiable functions in the n variables u1, . . . , un.
Find the (partial) derivatives of (f1, . . . , fm) after u1, . . . , un.

Some useful procedures
Procedure.
1) Sketch the general diagram as in Figure 10.1, and reduce the i-th f-coordinate and the j-th u-
coordinate as shown on Figure 10.2.
2) “Pull the diﬀerentiation apart” in the following way with k specimens (i.e. the number of x-
coordinates) on the right hand side
∂fi
∂uj
= ∂fi
∂
∂
∂uj
+ · · · + ∂fi
∂

∂uj
.
3) The empty places are then ﬁlled in with all the variables x1, . . . , xk from the layer in the middle,
∂fi
∂uj
= ∂fi
∂x1
∂x1
∂uj
+ · · · + ∂fi
∂xk
∂xk
∂uj
.
4) Repeat this process for every relevant i and j.
Remark 10.1 If one of the layers of diﬀerentiations only contains one variable, then ∂is replaced by
d, i.e. one writes d · · ·
d · · · instead of ∂· · ·
∂· · ·. ♦
10.3
Calculation of the directional derivative
Geometric interpretation: Assume that f(x) is a diﬀerentiable function. Then the directional
derivative
f ′(x; e)
of f at the point x and in the direction e indicates how much f(x) increases (decreases) per unit in
the direction e. By a direction we shall always understand a unit vector e, i.e. e = 1. In this case
we have
f ′(x; e) = e · ▽f(x).
Typical problems are:
Problem 10.2 Let a unit vector e be given.
Find the directional derivative f ′(x; e) of f in the direction e.
Procedure.
1) Calculate the gradient ▽f(x).
2) Calculate the inner product f ′(x; e) = e · ▽f(x).

Some useful procedures
Problem 10.3 Given two points x1 and x2.
Find the directional derivative of f(x) at x1 in the direction of x2.
Procedure.
1) Calculate the gradient ▽f(x) i x1.
2) Find the directional vector e from x1 to x2:
e =
x2 −x1
x2 −x1,
(Do not forget to ﬁnd the norm of the vector).
3) The directional derivative is given by
f ′(x1; e) = e · ▽f(x1) =
1
x2 −x1 (x2 −x1) · ▽f(x1).
Remark 10.2 The deﬁnition is extremely simple. Nevertheless it is causing students a lot of trouble
for some reason which is not understood by me. I have taken the consequence to include this section
here. Note that when we norm ▽f(x), we obtain the direction in which the function f(x) has its
highest increase. ♦

Some useful procedures
10.4
Approximating polynomials
The most common case is given by the following problem.
Other cases are obtained by suitable
modiﬁcations of it.
Problem 10.4 Find the approximating polynomial of at most second degree for a function f(x, y) in
two variables from the point (x0, y0) in its open domain.
There are here several possible methods, which all have there advantages and disadvantages, so one
cannot say that one particular method is always the easiest one to use. However, when the student
encounters this problem for the ﬁrst time, her or his preference will probably without doubt be the
following
A. Standard procedure
1) Start by explaining (text), why f is a C2-function in the neighbourhood of (x0, y0).
2) Calculate the following equations:
order zero:

f(x, y) = · · · ,
f(x0, y0) = · · · ,
ﬁrst order:



f ′
x(x, y) = · · · ,
f ′
x(x0, y0) = · · · ,
f ′
y(x, y) = · · · ,
f ′
y(x0, y0) = · · · ,
second order:









f ′′
xx(x, y) = · · · ,
f ′′
xx(x0, y0) = · · · ,
f ′′
xy(x, y) = · · · ,
f ′′
xy(x0, y0) = · · · ,
f ′′
yy(x, y) = · · · ,
f ′′
yy(x0, y0) = · · · .
3) Insert the values of the column to the right into the formula
P2(x, y)
=
f(x0, y0) + 1
1!

f ′
x(x0, y0) · (x −x0) + f ′
y(x0, y0) · (y −y0)

+ 1
2!

f ′′
xx(x0, y0) · (x−x0)2 + 2 f ′′
xy(x0, y0) · (x−x0)(y−y0) + f ′′
yy(x0, y0) · (y−y0)2
.
Remark 10.3 Since the approximating polynomial is the best description of f(x, y) in a neighbour-
hood of (x0, y0), the right variables here are always x −x0 and y −y0, and not x and y. Therefore,
one shall not reduce the expression further to a polynomial in x and y alone, because we by doing
this will obtain an expression with a higher numerical uncertainty! ♦
B. Taylor expansions
1) Explain (text) that f(x, y) is composed of standard functions, for which a Taylor expansion already
is known from e.g. Chapter 12.
2) Reset the problem to zero, i.e. change the variables to
(h, k) = (x −x0, y −y0),
(x, y) = (x0 + h, y0 + k).
Then we get f(x, y) = F(h, k) in the new variables (h, k).

Some useful procedures
3) Apply convenient standard expansions in F(h, k). We list all the usual standard expansions for t
small, which should be known.
1
1 −t = 1 + t + t2 + · · · ,
1
1 + t = 1 −t + t2 −· · · ,
(1 + t)α = 1 + αt + α(α −1)
2
t2 + · · · ,
ln(1 + t) = t −1
2 t2 + · · · ,
Arctan t = t −· · · ,
et = 1 + t + 1
2 t2 + · · · ,
sin t = t −· · · ,
cos t = 1 −1
2 t2 + · · · ,
sinh t = t + · · · ,
cosh t = 1 + 1
2 t2 + · · · ,
where the dots indicate terms of the type t2ε(t).
4) Calculate F(h, k), where every term which contains at least three factors of the type h, k, is
symbolized by · · · (of the type t2ε(t)).
5) One obtains the approximating polynomial by deleting the dots and then change variables back to
(h, k) = (x −x0, y −y0).
Remark 10.4 One should always be very careful to rewrite to one of the ten standard functions
above. We have for example (for α = 1/2)

♦
The following example shows that Taylor expansions may be easier to use than the standard procedure:
Example 10.1 Find the approximating polynomial of at most second degree for the function
f(x, y) = exp(x −y2) Arctan(x + 2y) cos(x2 + 4y)
from the point (x0, y0) = (2, −1).
It is obvious that the standard procedure will give us a mess of calculations! Let us therefore turn to
the method of using known Taylor expansions.
1. The function is a product of standard functions, where we know the Taylor expansions.
2. The change of variables is here
(h, k) = (x −2, y + 1),
i.e.
(x, y) = (2 + h, −1 + k).
In particular we get for t = h + 2k that
Arctan(x + 2y) = Arctan(h + 2k) = (h + 2k) + · · · ,
so it suﬃces to expand the other factors of only ﬁrst degree, since one degree is used in the factor
Arctan(h + 2k).

Some useful procedures
3. and 4. Since
exp(x −y2)
=
exp(1 + h + 2k −k2) = e · exp(h + k) · exp(−k2)
=
e · {1 + (h + 2k) + · · · } · {1 + · · · } = e + e · (h + 2k) + · · · ,
and
cos(x2 + 4y) = cos(4h + 4k + k2) = 1 + · · · ,
we get
f(x, y)
=
exp(1 + h + 2k −k2) Arctan(h + 2k) cos(4h + 4k + k2)
=
{e + e · (h + 2k) + · · · } · {(h + 2k) + · · · } · {1 + · · · }
=
e · (h + 2k) + e(h + 2k)2 + · · · .
5. The approximating polynomial is obtained by deleting the dots and then use the inverse transfor-
mation of variables,
P2(x, y)
=
e(h + 2k) + e(h + 2k)2
=
e{(x−2) + 2(y+1) + (x−2)2 + 4(x−2)(y+1) + 4(y+)2}.
It should be noted that there also exist examples where the standard procedure is the easiest one,
so it is impossible to say in advance that one method is always better that the other one. ♦

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Examples of diﬀerentiable functions
11.1
Gradient
Example 11.1 Assume that the function f : A →R, A ⊆Rk, satisﬁes
|f(x) −f(u)| ≤ax −uc+1,
x ∈K(u; b),
where u is a ﬁxed point in the open domain A of f and where b is so small that K(u; b) ⊂A. Prove
that f is diﬀerentiable at the point u with the gradient 0.
A Diﬀerentiability; gradient.
D Analyze the deﬁnition of diﬀerentiability.
I If we put x = u + h, then h = x −u, and the assumption of the example can be written
|f(u + h) −f(u)| ≤ah1+c = 0 · h + ˜ε(h) · h,
where ˜ε(h) = ahc →0 for h →0. This shows that there exist a function ε(h) with |ε(h)| ≤˜ε(h),
such that
f(u + h) −f(u) = 0 · h + ε(h) · h.
According to the deﬁnition, f is diﬀerentiable at u and its gradient is
▽f(u) = 0.
Example 11.2 Let P(x, y) be an homogeneous polynomial of degree n in two variables. Prove that
xP ′
x(x, y) + yP ′
y(x, y) = n P(x, y).
Formulate and prove an analogous theorem for an homogeneous polynomial of degree n in k variables.
A Homogeneous polynomials.
D Split P(x, y) into its parts and diﬀerentiate.
I A typical term in P(x, y) is of the form
Pk(x, y) = akxkyn−k,
from which we get
x (Pk)′
x + y (Pk)′
y
=
akkx · ck−1yn−k + ak(n −k)sky · yn−k−1
=
ak k xkyn−k + ak(n −k)xkyn−k
=
nakxkyn−k = n Pk(x, y).
Since diﬀerentiation and multiplication by x (or by y) are linear operations, it follows by adding
all such terms that we have for any homogeneous polynomial P(x, y) of degree n that
xP ′
x(x, y) + yP ′
y(x, y) = n P(x, y).

In general it follows that if P(x1, . . . , xm) is an homogeneous polynomial of degree n in m variables,
then

j=1
xjP ′
xj(x) = n P(x).
In fact, P(x) is built up by linear combinations of terms of the form
Q(x) = xk1

m = (k1 + · · · + km)Q(x) = n Q(x).
This holds for every term in any homogeneous polynomial P(x), and then it follows by the linearity
that it also holds for P(x) itself.

1) f(x, y) = Arctan x

A Gradients.
D Diﬀerentiate.
I 1) It follows from f(x, y, z) = (x + y)(y + z)(z + x) that
∂f
∂x = (x + z)(y + z) + (x + y)(y + z) = (2x + y + z)(y + z) = (x + y + z)2 −x2.
In this case it follows from the symmetry that we can simply interchange the letters in order
to get
∂f
∂y = (x + y + z)2 −y2,
∂f
∂z = (x + y + z)2 −z2,
hence
▽f =

.
2) It follows from
f(x, y, z) = x 3y+xz = x exp{(y + xz) ln 3}
that
∂f
∂x = 3y+xz + x 3y+xzz ln 3 = ey+xz(1 + xz ln 3),
∂f
∂y = x ey+xz ln 3,
∂f

and accordingly,

Examples of differentiable functions
Example 11.5 In some of the cases where it is not possible to decide only by using the rules of
calculation whether a given function of several variables is diﬀerentiable at some given point, one may
try instead to use the deﬁnition directly in the following way.
Use restrictions to see if the partial derivatives exist at the point. When this is the case, then insert
the values into the deﬁnition of diﬀerentiability, in which the ε function occurs; then check if this ε
function has the required property.
Use this procedure to prove the following claims:
• In 1)–3) the function is not diﬀerentiable at (0, 0).
• In 4)–5) the function is diﬀerentiable at (0, 0) with the gradient zero.

Example 11.6 Find in each of the following cases the gradient of the given function f : R3 →R.
The vector a is constant.
1) f(x) = x · a.
2) f(x) = (x · a)2.
3) f(x) = x × x.
4) f(x) = x × (x × a) · a.
A Gradients.
D Calculate the expressions and then diﬀerentiate.
I 1) Since f(x) = x · a = x1a1 + x2a2 + x3a3, it follows that
▽f(x) = a.
2) We get from f(x) = (x · a)2 = {x1a1 + x2a2 + x3a3}2 that
∂f
∂xi
= 2ai(x1a1 + x2a2 + x3a3) = 2ai (x · a),
so we get as expected,
▽f(x) = 2(x · a) a.

The chain rule
Example 11.8 . Use the chain rule to calculate the derivative of the function F(u) = f(X(u)), i.e.
without ﬁnding F(u) explicitly, in the following cases:
1) f(x, y) = xy, where X(u) = (eu, cos u), u ∈R.
2) f(x, y) = exy, where X(u) = (3u2, u3), u ∈R.
3) f(x, y) = x3 + y3 −3xy, where X(u) =

, u > −1.
4) f(x, y) = yx, where X(u) = (sin u, u3), u > 0.

6) f(x, y) = y sin x, where X(u) =

, u ∈R.
A The chain rule.
D Start by formulating the general chain rule. No matter the formulation we shall nevertheless also
calculate F(u) and ﬁnd the derivative in the usual way, so that it is possible to compare the two
methods.
I The task is to insert (correctly) into the chain rule,
F ′(u) = ∂f
∂x
dx
du + ∂f
∂y
dy
du,
where x and y are the coordinates of X = (x, y).
1) When f(x, y) = xy and (x, y) = (eu, cos u), we get
F ′(u) = y dx
du + x dy
du = cos u · eu −eu sin u = eu(cos u −sin u).
Test. By insertion we also have
F(u) = eu cos u,
so
F ′(u) = eu(cos u −sin u).
We see that we get the same result, and in this case the application of the chain rule is not
easier than the traditional method. ♦

Remark. From a pedagogical point of view it is very inconvenient that the usual method is easier
to apply in all cases than the chain rule. It is therefore here not very convincing that the chain rule
is a practical device in some situations, where the usual calculation becomes messy. The reader is
referred to Example 11.13, where the direct calculation is not possible, and yet the result can
be obtained by using the chain rule instead. ♦
Example 11.9 Calculate the partial derivatives of the function F(u, v) = f(X(u, v)) by means of the
chain rule, i.e. without ﬁnding F(u, v) explicitly, in the following cases:
1) f(x, y) = x2y, X(u, v) = (u + v, uv), where (x, y) ∈R2.
2) f(x, y) =
x
x + y , X(u, v) = (u2 + v2, 2uv), where (u, v) ∈R2
+.
3) f(x, y) = Arctan y
x, X(u, v) = (u2 −uv + v2, 2uv), where (u, v) = (0, 0).
4) f(x, y) = Arctan(x + y2), X(u, v) = (u, exp(u sin v)), where (u, v) ∈R2.
5) f(x, y) = x cos y, X(u, v) =
√
1 + u2 + v2 · Arcsin u, where |u| < 1 and v ∈R.
6) f(x, y) = x sinh y, X(u, v) = (u3v, ln u + ln v), where (u, v) ∈R2
+.
A Partial derivatives of composite functions by the chain rule.
D Set up the chain rule. Then diﬀerentiate in each case and insert. In spite of the text we shall
nevertheless check the result by using the traditional method in the test.
I The chain rule is written in two versions,
∂F
∂u = ∂f
∂x
∂x
∂u + ∂f
∂y
∂y
∂u
and
∂F
∂v = ∂f
∂x
∂x
∂v + ∂f
∂y
∂y
∂v ,
where one should be very careful to insert the right coordinates. Whenever f and x and y are
present, we ﬁrst calculate in the intermediate coordinates x and y, and then afterwards we put
x = x(u, v) and y = y(u, v). Therefore, in the rough workings we obtain a mixed result in which
both x and y as well as u and v occur. Then x and y are eliminated in the next step.
1) When f(x, y) = x2y and (x, y) = X(u, v) = (u + v, uv), then
∂f
∂x = 2xy
and
∂f
∂y = x2,
and
∂x
∂u = 1,
∂y
∂u = v,
∂x
∂v = 1,
∂y
∂v = u,
so
∂F
∂u = 2xy · 1 + x2 · v = 2(u + v)uv + (u + v)2v = v(u + v)(3u + v),
and
∂F
∂v = 2xy · 1 + x2 · u = 2(u + v)uv + (u + v)2u = u(u + v)(u + 3v).

Then clearly x + u = u2 + v2 + 2uv = (u + v)2 > 0 for (u, v) ∈R2

of fourth degree and with ± integers as coeﬃcients. It can be proved that the only possible
rational roots must be of the form a = ±1
1 = ±1, and it is easily seen that none of these
possibilities satisﬁes the equation. The problem is therefore to solve an equation of fourth
degree without any rational solutions, and such a procedure is not commonly known in Calculus

Remark. All these examples are very simple because they should train the reader to use a new

exist examples, like e.g. Example 11.13, where the chain rule is the most eﬃcient one. However,
in the previous two examples, Example 11.8 and Example 11.9 we must admit that the chain

D Since the functions X(u) and Y (u) cannot be found explicitly by elementary methods, we shall try
the chain rule instead.
Remark. The non-linear diﬀerential equation above is a so-called Ricatti equation. Such equations
cannot be solved in general unless one knows one solution. It can be proved that the equation then
can be completely solved. Therefore, one usually says that the Ricatti equation can only be solved
by guessing. This is not true. There exist some special cases, in which the Ricatti equation can
be completely solved without knowing a solution in advance. The considered equation is actually
of this type, but since its solution lies far beyond what can be mentioned here, we shall not solve
it. ♦
I First note that for xy2 > −1,
∂f
∂x =
y2
1 + xy2
and
∂f
∂y =
2xy
1 + xy2 .
Then
dX
du = X(u)2 + u2
and
dY
du = Y (u)2 + u2,
so when we apply the chain rule we get
F ′(u)
=
∂f
∂x
dX
du + ∂f
∂y
dY
du =
y2
1 + xy2

X(u)2 + u2

2X(u)Y (u)
1 + X(u)Y (u)2

Y (u)2 + u2
.
Now X(0) = 1 and Y (0) = 2, so X(u)Y (u)2 > −1 in an interval around u = 0, and F ′(0) is
deﬁned. We get the value by inserting the values of the calculations above.
F ′(0) =

1 + 1 · 4{1 + 0} + 2 · 1 · 2
1 + 1 · 4{4 + 0} = 4

Example 11.11 Let u and w denote two functions in two variables. We assume that they fulﬁl the
diﬀerential equations
a ∂w
∂t = −∂u
∂z ,
b ∂u
∂t = −∂w
∂z ,
(z, t) ∈R2.
We also consider two C1-functions F, G : R →R, and we put
u(z, t) = F(x + ct) + G(z −ct),
w(z, t) = γ{F(z + ct) −G(z −ct)}.
Prove that one can choose the constants c and γ such that the diﬀerential equations are satisﬁed.
A System of partial diﬀerential equations.
D Insert the given functions and ﬁnd c and γ.
I By partial diﬀerentiation we get
∂w
∂t = γ{cF ′(z + ct) + cG′(z −ct)} = cγ{F ′(z + ct) + G′(z −ct)},
∂w
∂z = γ{F ′(z + ct) −G′(z −ct)},
and
∂u
∂z = F ′(z + ct) + G′(x −ct),
∂u
∂t = c F ′(z + ct) −c G′(z −ct) = c{F ′(z + ct) −G′(z −ct)}.
It follows from the equation a ∂w
∂t = −∂u
∂z that
acγ{F ′(z + ct) + G′(z −ct)} = −{F ′(z + ct) + G′(z −ct)}.
Since F and G are arbitrary, we get acγ = −1.
Then it follows from the equation b ∂u
∂t = −∂w
∂z that
bc{F ′(z + ct) −G′(z −ct)} = −γ{F ′(z + ct) −G′(z −ct)}.
Since F and G are arbitrary, we get bc = −γ.
Then solve the system of two equations
acγ = −1
and
bc = −γ
in c and γ for given a, b > 0 by eliminating γ, i.e. −abc2 = −1, and then accordingly
c = + 1

These solutions are valid for any C1-functions F, G : R →R.
Remark 1. If F and G are of class C2, then the functions are solutions of the wave equation. ♦
Remark 2. The reason why the example is placed here is that one latently applies the chain rule
in a very simple version when we calculate the dd derivative. However, this cannot be clearly seen
due to all the other messages in the example. ♦

Example 11.12 Let Pn(x, y, z) be an homogeneous polynomial of degree n in three variables. Con-
sider Pn as a function of the spherical coordinates (r, θ, ϕ). Prove by using the result of Example 11.2
that
r ∂Pn
∂r = n Pn.
A Homogeneous polynomial in R3.
D Apply Example 11.2.
I We have according to Example 11.2,
x ∂Pn
∂x + y ∂Pn
∂y + z ∂Pn
∂z = n Pn.
Then note that
r ∂x
∂r = r ∂
∂r{r sin θ cos ϕ} = r sin θ cos ϕ = x
for r > 0,
and analogously for the other rectangular coordinate functions, so
r ∂x
∂r = x,
r ∂y
∂r = y,
r ∂z
∂r = z,
for r > 0.
Then we get by the chain rule

Considering the composite function F(u) = f(X(u), Y (u)) we shall ﬁnd the derivative F ′(0).

calculate f ′′

I 1) When (x, y) = (0, 0), we see that f(x, y) is a quotient of two polynomials where the denominator

We ﬁnd at (0, 0)
f(x, 0) −f(0, 0) = 0 = f(0, y) −f(0, 0),
so we conclude that
∂f
∂x(0, 0) = ∂f
∂y (0, 0) = 0.
Summarizing we see that the partial derivatives of ﬁrst order exist everywhere in R2.
2) Then it follows from the expressions of ∂f
∂x and ∂f
∂y that
∂f
∂x(0, y) −∂f
∂x(0, 0) = y5
y4 −0 = y,
and

so both

3) It follows from 1) that

This expression is not constant in ϕ (the latter factor is a polynomial of third degree in cos 2ϕ),
hence the limit does not exist when ̺ →0, and there are no further conditions on ϕ.
There is no point here to show the calculations in MAPLE, because the main issue is to give an
example where both f ′′

yx exist without being equal. MAPLE can be used, but only

so if we write t = x −2y + xy and include every term of higher degree than 2 in the dots, we
get
exp(x + xy −2y) = 1 + {x −2y + xy} + 1
2{x −2y + xy}2 + · · ·
= 1 + x −2y + xy + 1
2(2 −2y)2 + · · ·
= 1 + x −2y + xy + 1
2 x2 −2xy + 2y2 + · · ·
= 1 + x −2y + 1
2 x2 −xy + 2y2 + · · · .
As mentioned above the dots indicate the terms of higher degree than 2. We get the wanted
approximating polynomial by deleting the dots, i.e.
P(x, y) = 1 + x −2y + 1
2 x2 −xy + 2y2.
2) When the point of expansion is (1, 1) we get the coeﬃcients
f(1, 1) = 1,
f ′
x(1, 1) = 2,
f ′
y(1, 1) = −1,
f ′′
xx(1, 1) = 4,
f ′′
xy(1, 1) = f ′′
yx(1, 1) = −1,
f ′′
yy(1, 1) = 1,
so
Q(x, y)
=
f(1, 1) + f ′
x(1, 1)(x −1) + f ′
y(1, 1)(y −1)
+1
2f ′′
xx(1, 1)(x −1)2 + f ′′
xy(1, 1)(x −1)(y −1) + 1
2f ′′
yy(1, 1)(y −1)2
=
1 + 2(x −1) −(y −1) + 2(x −1)2 −(x −1)(y −1) + 1
2(y −1)2.
Remark. The variables in Q(x, y) ought to be (x −1, y −1) and not (x, y). The reason is
that the approximating polynomial Q(x, y) supplies us with the best approximation in the
neightbourhood of the point (1, 1), which means that for numerical reasons should not expand
from the fairly distant point (0, 0). ♦
The polynomial can also in this case be found alternatively. Since the point of expansion is (1, 1),
we introduce the new variables (h, k) = (x −1, y −1), which are small in the neighbourhood of
(1, 1). Hence, (x, y) = (h + 1, k + 1). Then
exp(x + xy −2y) = exp(h + 1 + (h + 1)(k + 1) −2(k + 1))
= exp(1 + h + 1 + h + k + hk −2 −2k) = exp(2h −k + hk)
= 1 + {2h −k + hk} + 1
2!{2h −k + hk}2 + · · ·

2(2h −k)2 + · · ·
= 1 + 2h −k + hk + 2h2 −2hk + 1
2 k2 + · · · ,
where the dots as usual indicate terms of higher degree. Thus
Q(x, y)

1 + 2h −k + 2h2 −hk + 1
2 k2
=
1 + 2(x −1) −(y −1) + 2(x −1)2 −(x −1)(y −1) + 1
2(y −1)2.

The approximations have a relatively large error (approx. 12 %). This is caused by the fact
that the point

Remark. This formula is useful in numerical calculations of f ′′
xy(x, y), when we know the values
of f(x + mh, y + nh), m, n ∈Z. ♦

are of third degree. This is, however, not the right procedure, because the point of expansion
is not (0, 0), but translated to (1, 3).

Examples of differentiable functions
In order to explain what is going on we shall ﬁrst apply the rather elaborate standard procedure,
for later to give an alternative. We get by the standard procedure,
f(x, y) = x3 + xy2 −12x −6y,
f(1, 3) = −20,
∂f
∂x = 3x2 + y2 −12,
∂f
∂x(1, 3) = 0,
∂f
∂y = 2xy −6,
∂f
∂y (1, 3) = 0,
∂2f
∂x2 = 6x,
∂2f
∂x2 (1, 3) = 6,
∂2f
∂x∂y = 2y,
∂2f
∂x∂y(1, 3) = 6,
∂2f
∂y2 = 2x,
∂2f
∂y2 (1, 3) = 2.
Then the approximating polynomial is
P2(x, y) = −20 + 3(x −1)2 + 6(x −1)(y −3) + (y −3)2,
where we of course use (x −1, y −3) as the new (and more correct) variables.
Alternatively we start by introducing (x1, y1) = (x −1, y −3) as our new variables, i.e.
(x, y) = (x1 + 1, y1 + 3). Then by insertion,
f(x, y)
=
x3 + xy2 −12x −6y
=
(x1 + 1)3 + (x1 + 1)(y1 + 3)2 −12(x1 + 1) −6(y1 + 3)
=

.
The approximative polynomial from (1, 3) is then obtained by deleting all terms of degree > 2
in (x1, y1), thus
P2(x, y)

1 + 6x1y1 + y2

We note that thee natural parameters are here (x, y, z −1).
Alternatively we exploit that (x −0) −(y −0) = x −y is the approximating polynomial
for sin(x −y) of at most second degree, and since the rest is a polynomial of second degree in
(x, y, z), we get
P2(x, y, z) = x −y + z(x + y) −2x + 1 = z(x + y) −(x + y) + 1 = 1 + (x + y)(z −1).

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

C It is actually possible to determine f(x, y) uniquely from the given information. In fact, if we
divide the latter equation by f(x, y) = 0, then
f ′
y(x, y)
f(x, y) = ∂
∂y ln |f(x, y)| = 2y.
When we integrate with respect to y we get with some arbitrary function ϕ(x) in x that ln |f(x, y)| =
y2 + ϕ(x). Hence there exists a function Φ(x), such that
f(x, y) = Φ(x) · exp(y2).
We put y = 0. Then it follows from the former of the given equations that
f(x, 0) = ex = Φ(x).
Hence
f(x, y)
=
exp(x + y2) = 1 + {x + y2} + 1
2{x + y2}2 + · · ·
=
1 + x + y2 + 1

I The logarithm is only deﬁned on the set of positive numbers, so (4y −y2 −x)√x must be deﬁned

0 < 4y −y2 −x = 4 −(4 −4y + y2) −x = 4 −(y −2)2 −x,
and thus
0 < x < 4 −(y −2)2.

Example 11.32 It is well-known that an equation like
f(x, y) = 0
under suitable circumstances can be solved with respect to one of its variables, and one has e.g. y =
Y (x), and then a diﬀerentiation of f(x, y) = 0 with respect to x gives a formula of the derivative:
Y ′(x) = −f ′
x(x, Y (x))
f ′y(x, Y (x)).
Prove by a similar procedure the formula
Y ′′(x) = −f ′′
yy(x, Y (x)){Y ′(x)}2+2f ′′
xy(x, Y (x))Y ′(x)+f ′′

This formula holds under the assumptions that the denominator is diﬀerent from zero, and that both

Example 11.33 Given the function
f(x, y) = y3 cos x + y + x −2,
(x, y) ∈R2.
1. Solve the equation f(0, y) = 0.
Then we get the information that the equation f(x, y) = 0 in a neighbourhood of the point (0, 1) deﬁnes
y uniquely as a function of x, i.e. y = Y (x).
2. Find Y (0), and then ﬁnd Y ′(0) and Y ′′(0) by using the formulæ from Example 11.32. Find the

Figure 11.4: The graph of the equation y3 cos x + y + x −2 = 0.
I 1) First solve the equation
0 = f(0, y) = y3 + y −2.
It is obvious that y = 1 is a solution. Since
f(0, y) = y3 + y −2 = y3 −y + 2(y −1) = (y −1)(y2 + 2),
it follows that y = 1 is the only real solution.

so in this sense ▽2f(x, y) is a measure of the deviation of the average from the value of the function.
If f is harmonic then ▽2f(x, y) = 0, so
f(x, y) = Mf((x, y); h) + ε(h) h2,
and we see that the average is a good approximation.

Examples of differentiable functions
Example 11.35 Find the approximating polynomial of at most second degree of the function
f(x, y) = x sinh(x + 2y),
(x, y) ∈R2
expanded from the point (x, y) = (2, −1).
A Approximating polynomial.
D Either use Taylor’s formula or known series expansions.
I First method. First calculate
f(x, y) = x sinh(x + 2y),
f(2, −1) = 0,
f ′
x(x, y) = sinh(x + 2y) + x cosh(x + 2y),
f ′
x(2, −1) = 2,
f ′
y(x, y) = 2x cosh(x + 2y),
f ′
y(2, −1) = 4,
f ′′
xx(x, y) = 2 cosh(x + 2y) + x sinh(x + 2y),
f ′′
xx(2, −1) = 2,
f ′′
xy(x, y) = 2 cosh(x + 2y) + 2x sinh(x + 2y),
f ′′
xy(2, −1) = 2,
f ′′
yy(x, y) = 4x sinh(x + 2y),
f ′′
yy(2, −1) = 0.
By means of the second column we get the coeﬃcients of the Taylor expansion, hence
P2(x, y)
=
0+ 1
1!{2(x−2)+4(y+1)}+ 1
2!{2(x−2)2+2 · 2(x−2)(y+1)+0}
=
2(x −2) + 4(y + 1) + (x −2)2 + 2(x −2)(y + 1).
Second method. First change variables by putting x = 2 + ξ and y = −1 + η. Then by insertion
followed by known series expansions, in which terms of higher order are written as dots,
f(x, y)
=
x sinh(x + 2y) = (2 + ξ) sinh(ξ + 2η)
=
(2 + ξ){(ξ + 2η) + · · · }
=
2ξ + 4η + ξ2 + 2ξη + · · ·
=
2(x −2) + 4(y + 1) + (x −2)2 + 2(x −2)(y + 1) + · · · ,
hence
P2(x, y) = 2(x −2) + 4(y + 1) + (x −2)2 + 2(x −2)(y + 1).
Remark. Of numerical reasons one shall always in examples of approximating polynomials use
the variables x −x0, here (x −2, y + 1), because the expansion is bound to the point x0, here
(2, −1). Many textbooks erroneously “reduce” further to the variables (x, y). ♦

insertion and introduction of a known series expansion for √1 + t, where the dots as usual

Note that D is the intersection of an open and a closed half plane.

1) D is not open, because a part of the boundary, though not the total boundary, lies in D,
2) D is not closed, because a part of the boundary, though not the total boundary, lies outside
D,
3) D is not bounded. The whole of the negative Y axis lies in D.

root is one of the most diﬃcult operations in Calculus. Do not forget the absolute value! ♦

Diﬀerentiation
Here are given the well-known rules of diﬀerentiation together with some rearrangements which some-
times may be easier to use:
{f(x) ± g(x)}′ = f ′(x) ± g′(x),
{f(x)g(x)}′ = f ′(x)g(x) + f(x)g′(x) = f(x)g(x)
f ′(x)
f(x) + g′(x)
g(x)

,
where the latter rearrangement presupposes that f(x) = 0 and g(x) = 0.
If g(x) = 0, we get the usual formula known from high school
f(x)
g(x)
′
= f ′(x)g(x) −f(x)g′(x)
g(x)2
.
It is often more convenient to compute this expression in the following way:
f(x)
g(x)

= d
dx

f(x) ·
1
g(x)

= f ′(x)
g(x) −f(x)g′(x)
g(x)2
= f(x)
g(x)
f ′(x)
f(x) −g′(x)
g(x)

,
where the former expression often is much easier to use in practice than the usual formula from high
school, and where the latter expression again presupposes that f(x) = 0 and g(x) = 0. Under these
assumptions we see that the formulæ above can be written
{f(x)g(x)}′
f(x)g(x)
= f ′(x)
f(x) + g′(x)
g(x) ,
{f(x)/g(x)}′
f(x)/g(x)
= f ′(x)
f(x) −g′(x)
g(x) .
Since
d
dx ln |f(x)| = f ′(x)
f(x) ,
f(x) = 0,
we also name these the logarithmic derivatives.
Finally, we mention the rule of diﬀerentiation of a composite function
{f(ϕ(x))}′ = f ′(ϕ(x)) · ϕ′(x).
We ﬁrst diﬀerentiate the function itself; then the insides. This rule is a 1-dimensional version of the
so-called Chain rule.

Integration
The most obvious rules are dealing with linearity

{f(x) + λg(x)} dx =

f(x) dx + λ

g(x) dx,
where λ ∈R is a constant,
and with the fact that diﬀerentiation and integration are “inverses to each other”, i.e. modulo some
arbitrary constant c ∈R, which often tacitly is missing,

f ′(x) dx = f(x).
If we in the latter formula replace f(x) by the product f(x)g(x), we get by reading from the right to
the left and then diﬀerentiating the product,
f(x)g(x) =

{f(x)g(x)}′ dx =

f ′(x)g(x) dx +

f(x)g′(x) dx.
Hence, by a rearrangement
The rule of partial integration:

f ′(x)g(x) dx = f(x)g(x) −

f(x)g′(x) dx.
The diﬀerentiation is moved from one factor of the integrand to the other one by changing the sign
and adding the term f(x)g(x).
Remark 12.3 This technique was earlier used a lot, but is almost forgotten these days. It must
be revived, because MAPLE and pocket calculators apparently do not know it.
It is possible to
construct examples where these devices cannot give the exact solution, unless you ﬁrst perform a
partial integration yourself. ♦
Remark 12.4 This method can also be used when we estimate integrals which cannot be directly
calculated, because the antiderivative is not contained in e.g. the catalogue of MAPLE. The idea is
by a succession of partial integrations to make the new integrand smaller. ♦
Integration by substitution:
If the integrand has the special structure f(ϕ(x))·ϕ′(x), then one can change the variable to y = ϕ(x):

f(ϕ(x)) · ϕ′(x) dx = “

f(ϕ(x)) dϕ(x)′′ =

y=ϕ(x)
f(y) dy.

Integration by a monotonous substitution:
If ϕ(y) is a monotonous function, which maps the y-interval one-to-one onto the x-interval, then

f(x) dx =

y=ϕ−1(x)
f(ϕ(y))ϕ′(y) dy.
Remark 12.5 This rule is usually used when we have some “ugly” term in the integrand f(x). The
idea is to put this ugly term equal to y = ϕ−1(x). When e.g. x occurs in f(x) in the form √x, we put
y = ϕ−1(x) = √x, hence x = ϕ(y) = y2 and ϕ′(y) = 2y. ♦

Trigonometric formulæ
The trigonometric formulæ are closely connected with circular movements. Thus (cos u, sin u) are
the coordinates of a point P on the unit circle corresponding to the angle u, cf. ﬁgure A.1. This
geometrical interpretation is used from time to time.

Figure 12.1: The unit circle and the trigonometric functions.
The fundamental trigonometric relation:
cos2 u + sin2 u = 1,
for u ∈R.
Using the previous geometric interpretation this means according to Pythagoras’s theorem, that the
point P with the coordinates (cos u, sin u) always has distance 1 from the origo (0, 0), i.e. it is lying
on the boundary of the circle of centre (0, 0) and radius
√
1 = 1.
Connection to the complex exponential function:
The complex exponential is for imaginary arguments deﬁned by
exp(i u) := cos u + i sin u.
It can be checked that the usual functional equation for exp is still valid for complex arguments. In
other word: The deﬁnition above is extremely conveniently chosen.
By using the deﬁnition for exp(i u) and exp(−i u) it is easily seen that
cos u = 1
2(exp(i u) + exp(−i u)),
sin u = 1
2i(exp(i u) −exp(−i u)),

Moivre’s formula: We get by expressing exp(inu) in two diﬀerent ways:
exp(inu) = cos nu + i sin nu = (cos u + i sin u)n.
Example 12.1 If we e.g. put n = 3 into Moivre’s formula, we obtain the following typical application,
cos(3u) + i sin(3u) = (cos u + i sin u)3
= cos3 u + 3i cos2 u · sin u + 3i2 cosu · sin2 u + i3 sin3 u
= {cos3 u −3 cosu · sin2 u} + i{3 cos2 u · sin u −sin3 u}
= {4 cos3 u −3 cosu} + i{3 sinu −4 sin3 u}
When this is split into the real- and imaginary parts we obtain
cos 3u = 4 cos3 u −3 cosu,
sin 3u = 3 sin u −4 sin3 u.

sin(u + v) = sin u cos v + cos u sin v,

Hyperbolic formulæ
These are very much like the trigonometric formulæ, and if one knows a little of Complex Function
Theory it is realized that they are actually identical. The structure of this section is therefore the same
as for the trigonometric formulæ. The reader should compare the two sections concerning similarities
and diﬀerences.
The fundamental relation:
cosh2 x −sinh2 x = 1.
Deﬁnitions:
cosh x = 1
2 (exp(x) + exp(−x)) ,
sinh x = 1
2 (exp(x) −exp(−x)) .
“Moivre’s formula”:
exp(x) = cosh x + sinh x.
This is trivial and only rarely used. It has been included to show the analogy.
Addition formulæ:
sinh(x + y) = sinh(x) cosh(y) + cosh(x) sinh(y),
sinh(x −y) = sinh(x) cosh(y) −cosh(x) sinh(y),
cosh(x + y) = cosh(x) cosh(y) + sinh(x) sinh(y),

Magnitudes of functions
We often have to compare functions for x →0+, or for x →∞. The simplest type of functions are
therefore arranged in an hierarchy:
1) logarithms,
2) power functions,
3) exponential functions,
4) faculty functions.
When x →∞, a function from a higher class will always dominate a function form a lower class. More
precisely:
A) A power function dominates a logarithm for x →∞:
(ln x)β
xα
→0
for x →∞,
α, β > 0.
B) An exponential dominates a power function for x →∞:
xα
ax →0
for x →∞,
α, a > 1.
C) The faculty function dominates an exponential for n →∞:
an
n! →0,
n →∞,
n ∈N,
a > 0.
D) When x →0+ we also have that a power function dominates the logarithm:
xα ln x →0−,
for x →0+,
α > 0.
