EFFECTIVE SOLUTES  
& WATER TRANSPORT 
LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
• Explain osmosis 
• Contrast osmolarity and tonicity   
• Explain how effective solutes regulate  
     fluid compartments of the body.        







GENERAL CONCEPTS 
1. The two fluid compartments of the body, intracellular  
fluid (ICF) and extracellular fluid (ECF), are in osmotic  
balance. 
2.    Water moves by facilitated diffusion through  
aquaporin channels across most cell membranes. This 
process is called osmosis. 
3.    Non-permeable solutes are called effective solutes. 
Cellular volume is critically dependent on the steady state 
of effective solutes and water across the cell membrane 
in exchange with the extracellular fluid compartment (ECF). 
4. Cells shrink in hypertonic  ECF conditions. Cells swell in 
Hypotonic ECF conditions.
