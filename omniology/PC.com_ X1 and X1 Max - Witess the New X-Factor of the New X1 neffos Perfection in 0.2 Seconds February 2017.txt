Inspired Design
The Neffos X1 and X1 Max features a stylish, sleek build, 
thanks to the premium materials used in the construction. The 
two models share the same metal exterior that was inspired by 
the rocks found in streams — smoothed by the water over time 
without losing their mettle.
Each detail is refined to make the phones feel familiar, and for a 
better user experience. The dual-curved back tapers to the side for 
maximum comfort, and for better single-hand use when compared 
to its peers in the market currently. 
The X1 Max features one of the narrowest edges in the industry at 
2.75mm, and at the same time the two phones are slender to the touch – 
measuring at 7.85mm for the X1 Max and 7.95mm for the X1. Plus, the two 
phone comes with super-thin bezels, chamfered edges and 2.5D glass that 
gives the phone a high screen-to-body ratio of 76 percent.
Made to Perform
Performance is something that the Neffos X1 and X1 Max has in 
spades. The powerful MediaTek Helio P10 processor gives it the 
grunt it needs to run just about any app under the sun with 
ease and lag free. Plus, the RAM supplied with the phone 
is plenty enough for any app to run without problems 
– with the X1 featuring either 2GB or 3GB of RAM, 
and the X1 Max coming with either 3GB or 4GB of 
RAM. Plus, there are options of having up to 64GB 
of storage on board, so you will never see a ‘Low 
Storage’ error appear on screen.
The fingerprint scanner on the phone 
is fast – real fast. It just takes 0.2 seconds 
for the Neffos X1 to unlock, thanks to the 
sensor’s sophisticated algorithms. It also 
learns from you – the more you unlock your 
smartphone, the more accurate and faster 
it gets. So you can literally tap and go on 
your daily life – while ensuring your data 
are kept well secured in the phone.
Perfection in 0.2 Seconds
X1 | X1 MAX

Top-notch Imaging
Nestled inside the rear of the phone is a 13-megapixel Sony IMX258 sensor with backside illumination and a fast Phase Detect Auto Focus (PDAF) of 
only 0.2 seconds, ensuring that images are sharp as tack as the shutter button is pressed. Thanks to the f/2.0 lens, the camera on the smartphones 
can take good and clear photos in low-light conditions while providing a shallow depth of field. Even the front 5-megapixel sensor is tuned for 
the best selfie ever. The Real-time Beautify mode makes taking selfies more intuitive and promises excellent results. The perfect selfie is just one 
tap away with the Neffos X1 and X1 Max.
Value Power
Not only it is powerful, it is full of value. While other comparable 
smartphones feature tiny batteries, the Neffos X1 series comes 
equipped with well-appointed power options. The long-lasting 
3,000mAh battery inside the X1 Max can go through a full day’s 
use – the same can be said about the X1’s 2250Mah battery.
Unlike other smartphones in its class, the Neffos even comes 
with a high-end feature – Fast Charging. Users can charge their 
nearly dead battery up to 50% capacity in just 30 minutes – so 
the phone can be used for longer periods of time throughout the 
day.
Bigger experience
The Neffos X1 display as a 5-inch HD screen, 
and the Neffos X1 Max features a 5.5-inch 
Full HD screen, giving users a big view on 
anything they have on screen. The full in-cell 
screen of the Neffos X1 series, combined with 
its 2.5D glass, provides you with a new visual 
dimension that is brighter, sharper and more 
defined than ever before. At the same time, 
the “touch and display driver integration” 
or TDDI technology greatly improves touch 
sensitivity for better user experience. Colours 
are rendered with utmost accuracy and 
vibrancy. Details are sharp and viewing angles 
are excellent even at awkward angles.

EDITOR’S NOTE
A WORD FROM
THE EDITOR
Sharil | PC.com Editor
H
ello everyone again. With just a few winks and 
days gone by – it is already the second month 
of 2017! How was your Chinese New Year 
celebrations? We at PC.com hope it was a good 
one, and will signal a prosperous year ahead for you (and 
for us as well).
We were lucky enough to be invited to the Consumer 
Electronics Show or also known as CES 2017. The show 
is the start of a new year for the tech community, as the 
latest and greatest gizmos, gadgets and technology was 
on display there. Do check out our cover story coverage of 
the show floor in this issue, and be amazed with what the 
coming year will be for tech.
Valentines is coming soon, and you may need ideas on 
what to give your significant other – at least pertaining to 
gadgets. Check out our Valentine’s list in Gizmos, and see 
if anything strikes your fancy to be a suitable gift for your 
loved one this month. 
We sure go a lot of new and exciting stuff in our Tested 
labs, where we start off with the best gaming console to 
come from Sony, the PS4 Pro. This hunk of metal, plastic 
and circuits had our gaming sense tickled, and we are 
excited to have it in our labs to try and see if the hype is 
real. Also, we do have a few other new cool stuff in line so 
check the Tested section out.
Gametime is where the latest and greatest news and 
reviews for gaming is in, and we are honoured to have a 
Malaysian-made game in our list this month. Sarah is 
Missing is a mobile game experience like no other, and it 
is proudly made in Malaysia. Do you fancy to be a sleuth? 
Check it out.
Also, I would like to say hello to our readers, as I take over 
the reins of Atifi as editor of PC.com. I hope to start a great 
engagement with all of you in the coming months. 
Signing off.

Subject 
I was reading through your FFXV game review and was wondering 
if your writer knows how to get Noctis Ultima Blade?
Rizal Rafizi
LETTER 
OF THE 
MONTH
Our writer does know! At the start of 
the game, Noctis will have his signature 
weapon known as the Engine Blade. As 
early as Chapter 2, you will be able to 
upgrade the Engine Blade three times 
with the help of Cid. These upgrades 
will be a sidequest on its own and you 
must look for the particular components 
to pass to Cid before he can make the 
modifications.
The first sidequest known as 
‘A Better Engine Blade I’ requires 
a Rusted Bit before it can be 
upgraded. ‘A Better Engine Blade 
II’ requires a Glass Gemstone and 
a Sturdy Helixhorn is needed for ‘A 
Better Engine Blade III’. The Sturdy 
Helixhorn, however, requires some 
time and effort.
To acquire the Sturdy Helixhorn, 
you will have to look for the Hunt 
labelled ‘The Last Spiracorns’ located 
at Old Lestallum. From there, you must 
break the horn of a Duplicorn in order 
to upgrade the Engine Blade into the 
Ultima Blade.

Samsung introduces the revamped Galaxy A Series
The A Stands For Awesome

“The Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7 are 
the latest additions to the Malaysian 
market and they complement the 
needs of connected millennials who 
crave spontaneity and seek life's 
pleasures in the most fulfilling way. 
The millennial consumers are socially 
active, 
fun-seeking 
individuals 
who live in the moment, and we 
at Samsung want to help them get 
ready for anything that comes their 
way. So for the first time ever in the 
Galaxy A Series, we made the 2017 
variant to be dust and water resistant 
– youthful, trendy and cool as the 
right companion for mellennials!” 
said Mr. Lee Jiu Siang, Vice President, 
IT & Mobile Business Unit, Samsung 
Malaysia Electronics.
The stand out feature of both the 
Galaxy A5 and A7 would be the IP68 
dust and water resistance rating, 
making it the first in Samsung's mid-
range smartphones to carry it. Both 
devices also come with USB Type-C 
ports and is equipped with fast 
charging, allowing you to keep the 
device fully charged faster. It also 
comes with  16 megapixels for both 
the front and rear cameras with f1.9 
aperture lens and also PDAF sensors 
for the rear and FF sensors at the 
front. Taking its cue from the flagship 
Galaxy mobile device experience, the 
new Galaxy A Series comes with the 
vivid Full HD 5.7-inch (A7) and 5.2-inch 
(A5) Super AMOLED screen displays – 
perfect for immersive gaming on the 
go or even binge-watching videos 
from YouTube and Netflix.
Another 
great 
feature 
that 
Samsung releases with the Galaxy

alternative when making purchases 
at places where credit, debit and 
prepaid cards are accepted. This new 
method of wireless mobile payment is 
compatible with both NFC and MST, 
both of which are included in the 
Galaxy A Series. The mySamsung app

to set up, manage and optimise their 
Samsung experience while staying 
up to date with the latest offers and 
promotions. Both the A7 and A5 are 
available in Black Sky and Gold Sand 
colour options and will be available at 
all Samsung brand stores nationwide

n conjunction with the 10 year 
anniversary of the Sony Alpha 
line, Sony Malaysia has officially 
announced a new range of 
high speed Autofocus (AF) enabled 
cameras in multiple categories, which 
includes both mirrorless and compact 
cameras. The new Sony α99 II, 
α6500 and RX100 V are now officially 
launched in Malaysia. 
“We are continuing to push the 
boundaries of modern innovation in 
digital imaging, in particular within 
the mirrorless space,” said by Mr. 
Satoru Arai, Managing Director of Sony 
Malaysia. “Sony is an overall leader in 
digital imaging and the world's largest 
image sensor manufacturer. Over 
time, Sony has experienced a robust 
boost in mirrorless camera sales, 
strengthening our dominant position as 
the No.1 overall full-frame mirrorless 
brand, a position Sony has held for 6 
consecutive years since 2010, thanks to 
the immensely successful a7 series and 
α6500 series.”
I
A new Sony photography 
experience
The new Sony α99 II, α6500 and RX100 V launched in Malaysia
The new cameras are the epitome 
of the company’s journey in digital 
imaging thus far. The Sony α99 II is 
Sony’s update to the popular α99 
SLT camera, with a slew of new 
improvements and updates to the 
camera. First, it now receives the new 
42.4 megapixel full-frame sensor as 
the Sony α7-series, giving it a high 
dynamic range with every press of 
the shutter button. The camera also 
receives the 5-axis stabilisation 
system, ensuring shake-free images 
whenever the camera is in motion or 
in use. 4K recording is now standard 
in the camera as well. 
For 
the 
mirrorless 
market, 
the α6500 is an update in Sony’s 
mirrorless line-up. Shares the same 
unrivalled 4D FOCUS system as 
the α6300 camera, which can lock 
focus on a subject in as little as 
0.05 seconds. The new model can 
shoot images at up to 11 frames per 
second with continuous autofocus 
and exposure tracking and up to 
8 frames per second in a live-
view shooting mode with its 24.2 
megapixel Exmor sensor. Thanks to 
the expanded buffer, it can shoot up 
to 307 frames before running out of 
cache space. Also for the first time 
in the line’s history, the camera 
now comes equipped with both the 
5-axis stabilization system as well 
as a touch-sensitive screen for easy 
operation and navigation.
Compact cameras can’t get any 
better with the Sony Cybershot RX100 
V. In a small compact body, the camera 
hides a 20.1 megapixel 1-inch sensor, 
paired to a ZEISS Vario-Sonnar T* 
24-70 mm 5 F1.8 – 2.8 large aperture 
lens assembly as well as the excellent 
pop-up electronic view finder that is 
synonymous with the line. It also 
records in 4K video, as well as super 
slow motion recording at up to 960 
fps 7 with extended recording time.
The new α99 II, α6500 & RX100 V 
will be available throughout Malaysia 
with the pricing of RM12,299 for α99 
II; RM6,499 for α6500 (body only) and 
RM4,599 for the RX100 V.

INTRODUCING YOUR E-WASTE RECYCLING 
PARTNER, USEDCOMPUTER
Turn obsolete and redundant electronics into something useful for the community
Rethink
Rethinking is the most effective of the 3Rs and the 
way to begin, and is also the most complex, as it 
requires letting go of some notions like ‘new trumps 
old’.We are always re-thinking and finding better, 
more effective ways to recycle in our commitment to 
a healthier environment.
Reuse
Before we recycle or dispose the E-Waste, we evaluate 
whether it has life left in it, and put it back to use. Reusing 
keeps new resources from being used for a while longer, 
and old resources from entering the waste stream.
Recycle
Recycling is the utilization of something old and 
turning it into something new. This involves making 
new products out of old products. This means the 
potential landfill wastes become a new product 
hence protecting the environment.
We offer a holistic IT, Computer and Electronics 
disposal service to address the vital requirements of 
clients, such as:

The New Sheriff In Town
Oppo's latest release – the R9s takes over as its best camera smartphone
amous for being the camera 
expert in the smartphone 
industry, Oppo introduces its 
latest flagship to its series 
of smartphones, the Oppo R9s. The 
title was previously held by Oppo's 
very own F1 Plus but it has since 
relinquished it to the R9s as the top 
camera smartphone by Oppo.
Not only is it powered with a 
16 megapixel rear camera, the R9s 
also comes with extra-wide f/1.7 
aperture lens and is coupled with 
the new Dual PDAF technology. This 
drastically improves the rear camera 
technology 
that 
enables 
users 
to capture clear photos anytime, 
anywhere. At the centre of the 
R9s' camera lies the all-new Sony 
IMX398 sensor – a customised 1/2.8 
inch sensor developed by both Sony 
and Oppo. You can now capture 40% 
more light thanks to the sensor added

with an extra-wide f/1.7 aperture 
lens as well as having phenomenal 
focusing speed with noise reduction 
and great low-light performance.
In addition to that, the R9s also 
introduces Oppo's VOOC Flash 
Charge technology for fast charging 
with lightning-quick fingerprint 
access. Lying at the heart of the 
R9s is the Qualcomm octa-core 
processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB 
of internal storage space. The body 
of the R9s is also equipped with 
98.9% metal, giving it a subtle yet 
refined look.

Year of the Rooster to be a better year 
for Malaysia’s Digital Economy
Rising customer confidence to boost more spending on online and mobile platforms
ith the turbulent 2016 
passing us by, iPay88 
expects 2017 as a 
better year for the country’s Digital 
Economy. Based on the insights of 
tracking key 2016 online shopper’s 
trends, the leading provider of online 
payment service solutions in ASEAN 
shares some information on what 
the market can expect from shoppers 
in the year to come. 
The 
Executive 
Director 
of 
iPay88, Chan Kok Long says, “All 
the collective signs in our online 
payment gateway show that even 
after a turbulent 2016, the coming 
year of the fiery Rooster would be a 
better year – attributing to a few key 
predictive factors.”
ipay88 sees the mobile shopping

shows that the total transactions 
generated by mobile commerce has 
W
grown significantly by 148.9 per cent 
from 3.7 million in 2015 to 9.3 million 
in 2016. They also expect that in 
2017, 
mobile 
application-based 
visits to the retail category would 
also finally surpass mobile web 
visits, while desktop visits would 
eventually see a decline in growth. 
The increasing number of mobile-
payment services also contributes 
to the rising customer confidence on 
mobile shopping in 2017.
They also see that online banking 
payments will still be a popular 
choice of payment as consumers 
become warier on spending on credit 
thanks to the uncertain economy. On 
the other hand, they see the market 
may experience a potential shift 
from using physical credit cards 
to ‘virtual’ payment alternatives.

and continues to gain momentum in 
customer adoption in the country,” said 
Mr. Lee Jui Siang, Vice President of

A secure and easy-to- use mobile 
payment service, Samsung Pay can 
be used to make purchases almost 
anywhere that credit, debit and 
prepaid cards are accepted. Users 
only need to swipe-up their eligible 
payment card on eligible Galaxy

Breaking bad 
password habits
Kaspersky says online users need to protect themselves with better passwords
nternet 
users 
across 
the 
globe are yet to master how 
to use passwords effectively 
to protect themselves online. 
Research from Kaspersky Lab has 
shown that people are putting their 
online safety at risk by making bad 
password decisions and simple 
password mistakes that may have 
far-reaching consequences.
“Considering the amount of 
private and sensitive information that 
we store online today, people should 
be taking better care to protect 
themselves with effective password 
protection. This seems obvious, but 
many might not realise that they 
are falling into the trap of making 
simple 
password 
management 
mistakes. These mistakes, in turn, 
are effectively like leaving the front 
door open to emails, bank accounts, 
personal files and more”, says Andrei 
Mochola, Head of Consumer Business 
at Kaspersky Lab.
Among the findings were that 
almost one in five people have faced 
an account hacking attempt. In 
spite of the high number only 30% 
of internet users create different 
passwords for different services – 
which is the recommended way to 
go. Even more worryingly, 10% use 
the same password for all their online 
accounts – making them a ripe target 
to be exploited. 
A 
weak 
password 
is 
also 
something of a concern – just a 
bit under half of users is a mix of 
upper and lowercase letters, and 
two-thirds mixes up with letters 
and numbers. A worrying trend 
is that users are mistreating 
their 
passwords 
by 
sharing 
them with other people. Family 
members, friends and even close 
acquaintances – passwords should 
not be shared with anybody. 
Kaspersky 
offers 
a 
secure 
password application called the 
Kaspersky 
Password 
manager, 
which 
securely 
stores 
all 
passwords, addresses and credit 
card details, and synchronises them 
across all devices so that users 
only need to remember one master 
password. Users no longer need 
I
to practise bad password habits, 
thanks to the password manager.
Mochola 
continued, 
“The 
Internet has been around for a 
while now but people are still 
making simple mistakes when it 
comes to online passwords. The 
best passwords cannot be found 
in the dictionary. They are long, 
with upper and lowercase letters, 
numbers and punctuation marks. 
However, with people having so 
many online accounts today, it’s 
not easy to remember a secure 
password for everything. Using a 
password management solution can 
help people remember and generate 
strong passwords to minimise the 
risk of account hacking online.”

Malaysia IT spending to 
reach RM 70.2 Billion in 2017
Gartner forecasts spending will increase globally by 2.7 percent
ompanies in Malaysia  are 
forecasted to spend up 
to RM 70.2 billion in the 
upcoming 12 months, according to 
research data supplied by Gartner. 
Worldwide, we are expected to see 
up to USD 3.5 trillion (about RM 15.6 
trillion) – which is an increase of 2.7 
percent over 2016, but falls short of 
the projected three percent. 
"2017 was poised to be a rebound 
year in IT spending. Some major 
trends have converged, including 
cloud, blockchain, digital business 
and artificial intelligence. Normally, 
this would have pushed IT spending 
much higher than 2.7 percent 
growth," said John-David Lovelock, 
research vice president at Gartner. 
"However, some of the political 
uncertainty in global markets has 
fostered a wait-and-see approach 
causing many enterprises to forestall 
IT investments."
The worldwide IT services market 
is forecast to grow 4.2 percent in 
2017. Buyer investments in digital 
business, intelligent automation, and 
services optimisation and innovation 
continue to drive growth in the 
market, but buyer caution, fuelled by 
broad economic challenges, remains 
a counter-balance to faster growth.
"The range of spending growth 
from the high to low is much larger 
in 2017 than in past years. Normally, 
the economic environment causes 
some level of division, however, 
in 2017 this is compounded by the 
increased levels of uncertainty," 
said Mr. Lovelock. "The result of that 
uncertainty is a division between 
individuals and corporations that will 
spend more — due to opportunities 
arising — and those that will retract 
or pause IT spending." 
C

016 has been a challenging year for politics, 
public sanity and celebrity longevity, 
but at the same time for individuals and 
companies, a testing time in terms of online 
security. Pitted against increasingly sophisticated 
and targeted cybercriminals, it’s not been easy 
going, as these notable security incidents from the 
past 12 months reveal.
Dyn DDOS ATTACK
In October, cybercriminals launched major DDoS 
attacks, disrupting a host of websites, including the 
likes of Twitter, Netflix, PayPal, Pinterest and the 
PlayStation Network, amongst many others.
The attack was staggering for its size, at one 
time measuring close to 1 Tbps. The group behind 
the attack did this by compromising thousands of 
endpoint IoT devices (initially thought to be 100,000 
– later downscaled to nearer 20,000 by security 
researchers), transforming them in a botnet and 
essentially flooding traffic to DNS hosting provider 
Dyn (recently acquired by Oracle).
Of course, this attack had a short-term effect on 
some of the world’s most popular sites but that’s not 
what makes it significant, nor too the attack method 
(DDoS remains in the toolkit of every cybercriminal).
No, the attack was staggering for its size, 
measuring close to 1 Tbps at one time, which was 
not dissimilar to the DDoS attack which targeted 
Brian Krebs’ website one month earlier (more on 
this later). And with Gartner predicting that there 
will be 20.8 billion ‘connected’ things talking to 
each other by 2020, you can be sure that this kind 
of DDoS attack is just the start.

TESCO BAnK CuSTOMERS lOSE 
REAl MOnEy
Approximately 40,000 Tesco Bank accounts were 
compromised in a cyberattack in early November, 
but this in itself was not hugely significant – after 
all we have seen bigger data breaches (think 
Target in 2013).
Instead, it was the tale of thousands of 
customers losing physical money from their 
accounts – a rarity in a cybercrime age where 
most damage is naked to the human eye.
The bank, which has more than seven million 
customers, reported that roughly 9,000 customers 
had as much as £600 (approximately $763) 
siphoned from their accounts, and pledged to 
refund those losses within 24 working hours.
The precise nature of the attack was unclear, 
with some suggesting the compromise of a third-
party retailer and others pointing to cybercriminal 
activity. One customer said that cash had been 
withdrawn from his account in four separate 
transactions, with all of these coming from Rio de 
Janeiro in Brazil.
Needless to say the attack has far-reaching 
consequences not only for the customer but 
for Tesco too, with the UK’s Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) preparing to issue a potentially 
huge fine.
DDOS AuTOMATInG SySTEMS 
In FInlAnD
The Dyn DNS attack rightfully grabbed the 
headlines for IoT security (or lack of it) in 
October, but one month later there was another 
security incident that had arguably far bigger 
consequences.
In an attack that once again illustrates the 
danger of connected IoT devices, cybercriminals 
in Finland were able to halt the heating in two 
buildings in the city of Lappeenranta.
Local reports suggest that cybercriminals 
were not only able to compromise the building 
automation system used across the two buildings 
by flooding it with bogus traffic – forcing devices 
to restart every few minutes – but also denying 
administers remote access to the device.
This meant that technicians had to physically 
visit the buildings and remove the affected 
hardware from the internet until the malicious 
traffic could be filtered out.
IT management company Valtia said that there 
is strong evidence that vulnerable and internet 
exposed devices manufactured by the local 
tech manufacturer Fidelix were to blame for the 
incident.
uS DEPARTMEnT OF JuSTICE 
EMPlOyEES lOSE OuT
In February, cybercriminals reportedly angry about 
US ties with Israel breached the US Department of 
Justice’s database.
The attack highlighted how big government 
agencies can suffer from the same issues as 
enterprises CNN reported the attackers released 
data on 10,000 Department of Homeland Security 
employees one day, and then released data on 
20,000 FBI employees the next day. Information 
stolen and released included names, titles,

incidents of 2016

phone numbers, and email addresses, although 
the Department of Justice said it did not believe 
other sensitive information, such as social security 
numbers, were obtained.
The method of attack remains a mystery, but what 
is significant about it is that it revealed that not only 
can cybercriminals compromise a big government 
agency, but also drew attention to the fact that they 
suffer from the very same issues as enterprises.
After all, the cybercriminals – apparently 
tweeting from the account @DotGovs – claimed 
it took one week for the Department of Justice to 
realize that their systems had been compromised.
ADulTFRIEnDFInDER.COM GETS 
ATTACKED OnCE MORE
X-rated adult website AdultFriendFinder has now 
been hit by cybercriminals in consecutive years, 
with this year’s attack in November involving far 
more people than before.
This time, the amount of accounts compromised 
was immense — approximately 412 million users 
had personal information stolen and published in 
criminal marketplaces on the dark web.
The breached data included email addresses, 
passwords, VIP member status, browser info, last 
IP address to log in, and purchases. LeakedSource 
was responsible for finding and reporting the 
breach to the public’s attention.
What can we learn from this? Organizations 
will continue to ignore security if they see 
breaches as good PR, and online privacy can never 
be guaranteed – wherever you go on the web.
nO ‘PEACE OF MInD’ FOR 
lInKEDIn, TuMBlR AnD 
MySPACE
Back in June, a cybercriminal going by the name of 
‘Peace’ came to prominence after data on millions 
of LinkedIn, Tumblr and Myspace users was made 
available online. All in, there were more than half 
a billion passwords posted.
Indeed, Peace’s dark web store has plenty 
of merchandise. According to Wired, his store 
includes 167 million user accounts from LinkedIn, 
360 million from MySpace, 68 million from Tumblr, 
100 million from the Russian social media site 
VK.com, and most recently another 71 million 
from Twitter, adding up to more than 800 million 
accounts and growing.
These collections of data thefts resulted in 
the social media takeovers of Facebook CEO Mark 
Zuckerberg, popstars Katy Perry and Drake, and 
Twitter cofounder Biz Stone to name a few.
But quite how he – if he indeed did it alone 
– managed to clock up such a data pool remains a 
mystery. There’s some suggestion that this is old 
data dating back to 2012 and that the severity of 
these attacks has been magnified through people 
reusing passwords.
KREBS SITE HIT WITH DDOS
Security journalist and researcher Brian Krebs is a 
respected name in the industry, outing cybercrime 
groups and revealing data breaches long before the 
affected companies themselves even knew of them.
But such efforts can put you at the hands of the 
wrong people, as Krebs found out in September when 
his website, arguably far more secure than most, 
was hit by a (then) record DDoS attack measuring in 
at between 620 and 655 Gbps.
The attack, though unsuccessful thanks to the 
efforts of the DNS provider Akamai, was stunning 
because the previous record-high DDoS attack was 
363 Gbps. Not only that but, whilst the smaller attack 
was reliant on a technique to essentially ‘amplify’ a 
smaller attack into a bigger one, the Krebs’ attack 
turned out to simply be launched by a huge botnet of 
compromised devices.
What did we learn from this? Well, DDoS attacks 
are growing at a rapid rate in terms of size, and they 
are no longer just an entry-level attack to launch 
another attack, or to further infiltrate the network.
yAHOO SuFFERS FROM MASSIVE 
DATA BREACH #1
In September, search engine, email provider and one-
time Google rival Yahoo was hit by what was later 
described as the ‘biggest data breach in history’.
The company was forced to admit that up to 
500 million customers may have had data stolen, 
including sensitive details such as names, email 
addresses, phone numbers and hashed passwords. 
While the size of attack was significant, it was 
notable too that fingers were being pointed at a 
state-sponsored actor.
This was not Yahoo’s first embarrassment 
as far as cybersecurity is concerned – it was 
breached in 2014 too – but what is particularly 
intriguing is that Yahoo may have known about 
the attack since August, two months prior to the 
breach being reported.
yAHOO SuFFERS FROM MASSIVE 
DATA BREACH #2
We often write ahead in the industry, meaning 
that this security incident didn’t even make the 
first draft of this feature. But, there you go 
– you can never rest on your laurels when it 
comes to cybercrime.
This unprecedented data breach made the 
front pages of websites all over the world on 
December 14th and 15th. Yahoo announced that 
this time around, up to one billion user accounts 
were thought to have been compromised – 
and, more devastatingly, it was revealed that 
this was a different incident to that related to 
2014’s data breach.
According to Bob Lord, chief information 
security officer at Yahoo, it is believed that this 
data breach goes back as far as August 2013. 
While names, email addresses, phone numbers 
and hashed passwords were accessed, no bank 
account and payment data was compromised 
(it’s not stored on its system).
ESET’s Mark James commented: “So what 
can you do about the breach? NOTHING! Sorry, 
but it’s true, there is nothing you can do about 
that particular data breach but you can try and 
limit any further damage as a result of your data 
going missing.”
Accordingly, he offers some really useful 
and insightful security advice, so please do 
read his article. What does this mean for the 
security industry? It’s too early to say, but what 
is certain is that this marks a tipping point.
PHIlIPPInE ElECTIOn VOTERS 
TARGETED By AnOnyMOuS
It may not have made front pages in the western 
hemisphere, but in April this was one of the 
most poignant and devastating cyberattacks of 
2016.
A breach of the database for the Philippine 
Commission on Elections (COMELEC) resulted 
in the loss of personal information on every 
single voter in the Philippines — approximately 
55 million people. Allegedly breached by 
Anonymous Philippines, the information was 
made public online by Lulzsec Pilipinas.
Anonymous’ actions were allegedly an effort 
to push COMELEC to turn on security features 
in the vote counting machines before the 
national elections on May 9th. This comes at 
an interesting time, and suggests politics could 
well be more influenced by outside forces than 
we like to admit.

 A Security Asset
Internet security trends with ESET
rotecting yourself while 
being online has become 
a need, especially when 
you never know when danger 
lurks. Malicious software and 
even people can even conceal 
themselves to make it look like 
you’re safe…in actuality, it just 
makes you let your guard down. 
As internet threats get more 
and more diverse, users need 
more complex internet security 
suites with features based on 
individual preferences. PC.com 
speaks to Roman Kovac, Head of 
Security Research lab of ESET 
HQ Slovakia to find out what the 
company is about and some of the 
many threats that lurks online. 
PC.com: Tell us about your role 
in ESET. 
Roman Kovac: I’m responsible 
for the Security Research Lab, or 
shortly, Virus Lab. The department 
has 
several 
roles 
including 
malware analysts, researchers, 
and detection engineers. Our 
method of detecting new threats 
can be done through technology, 
which involves proactive detection. 
We can detect threats through the 
samples we have even before it 
happens, though not all the time. 
In some cases, you need to create 
different layers of protection to be 
able to catch them. 
PC.com: 
What 
should 
consumers be concerned about 
when it comes to Internet 
security? 
Kovac: I would say one of them 
would be ransomware. As the 
name suggest, there will be some 
sort of ransom involved, which we 
don’t recommend “paying”. Some 
people unfortunately do. The best 
way is to have a proper backup 
system in place – even if you’re 
infected with ransomware, you’ll 
have no issue since you can just 
use the backup files. However, 
most consumers don’t have a 
system in place; I don’t think the 
vast majority are aware of the 
need. Another concern would be 
banking Trojans. 
PC.com: How is this different 
from 
those 
banking 
email 
scams and why is it happening?
Kovac: This isn’t something new 
but it’s continuously evolving 
and coming back all the time. 
Recently, there had been several 
cases in Europe where a malware 
called Remote Access Trojan (RAT) 
was stealing Internet banking 
credentials. It was targeting users 
of European online banking. 
This is still happening because 
users are not careful about the 
links they click and freely provide 
their information to pages that 
look legitimate without checking 
the authenticity. It’s definitely a 
challenge for users to distinguish 
some of them as some of them look 
like the real deal, right down to the 
‘Secure’ certification on the browser. 
Unless you click on the ‘Secure’ 
lock icon and check the details of 
the certificate, you’ll be fooled into 
thinking that it is really the bank’s 
online banking login page. 
PC.com: How about things like 
adware? Should consumers be 
concerned about this as well? 
Kovac: Adware is something is quite 
prevalent but it isn’t as dangerous 
as ransomware or banking Trojans. 
It can definitely affect the users 
experience and the performance of 
your computer.
PC.com: How can consumers 
protect themselves from these 
threats? 
Kovac: First and foremost, you should 
do regular updates on the operating 
system and the applications you use 
due to the various evolving exploits. 
This is especially so in an office 
setting, where your browser should 
also be regularly updated. 
P
Secondly, it’s always recommended 
to have a good security solution in place 
like an anti-virus. You don’t need an overly 
complicated security solution in place to 
protect yourself. For basic needs, we 
have the ESET Internet Security. If you’re 
looking for a suite, the new version 10 
of our ESET Smart Security Premium is 
built upon the award-winning NOD32 
technology that offers the optimal mix of 
detection, speed and usability. 
"Our method of detecting 
new threats can be done 
through technology, 
which involves proactive 
detection."

selfie-snapping ability. The new R9s carries forward that brilliant 
suite of front camera features and rounds them off with a rear 
photography experience that elevates its predecessor’s. With 
its head-turning design, powerful performance and superb 
all-around photography experience, the R9s is set to let users 
capture their lives in style at a cool RM1,798 price point.

Black Beauty
Exuding a mysterious yet enthralling vibe, the glossy 
new colourway of Black Pearl for Galaxy S7 edge subtly 
radiates quality and luxury in the palm of your hand. 
The latest colour variant of the highly popular Galaxy 
S7 edge, the Black Pearl colour also comes with 128GB 
internal memory, in comparison with the standard 32GB 
variant currently in the market. While those were largely 
inspired by calming, natural hues, Black Pearl is designed 
to be modern and striking, perfect for those who 
love exploring the latest trends. The sleek black finish 
blankets the entire device – edges and all – and adds 
depth to its glass design. 
Show Me That Smile
The Kolibree Ara is the first toothbrush with 
embedded AI (artificial intelligence), which features 
patented deep learning algorithms embedded directly 
inside the toothbrush on a low-power processor. Raw 
data from the sensors runs through the processor, 
enabling the system to learn your habits and refine 
accuracy the more it’s used. Ara even knows precisely 
where in your mouth you are brushing, even when not 
connected to the app on a mobile device.

COVER STORY
“W
hat an incredible 
way to celebrate 
the 
50th 
anniversary 
of 
CES – with the largest show floor in our 
history showcasing the next generation 
of innovation that will revolutionise our 
world,” says Gary Shapiro, president and 
CEO, CTA.
“The products and services unveiled 
at CES 2017 will touch nearly every 
single global industry. From the latest 
in virtual reality, smart home, self-
driving vehicles, robotics, wearables, 
health and fitness tech and more, 
CES 2017 is unveiling the future of 
the connected experience and what 
it means for consumers around the 
world.”
Prior to the actual show days, 
more than 2,000 members of the press 
got a sneak peak of the innovation to 
be launched. The quintessential CES 
Unveiled – an annual exclusive for 
media affair – featured the latest in 
virtual reality, companion sensing 
robots, wireless headphones, sleep 
trackers, smart lighting, wearables 
and much more. 
In addition to CES Unveiled, CES 
2017 introduced two full Media Days, 
where a wide array of companies 
– both large and small – took the 
opportunity to introduce its latest 
products to the global market. The 
range of launches set the stage 
for the week filled with innovation 
as 28 companies hosted pre-show 
news conferences and major product 
announcements. Here are just some 
of our picks: 
Samsung
Samsung 
Electronics 
unveiled 
its vision for 2017 and how it is 
reaching higher with a wide range of 
innovations to provide consumers with 
their best experience yet at the CES 
2017. Key product announcements 
included the stunning new QLED TV 
line-up, FlexWash + FlexDry laundry 
system, Samsung’s first-ever gaming 
laptop – the Samsung Notebook 
Odyssey, and updates to the Gear S3 
smartwatch. 
Additionally, 
the 
consumer 
tech giant bagged more than 120 
awards at CES 2017 in the home 
entertainment, home appliance and 
mobile categories. Among Samsung’s 
notable wins are 34 CES 2017 
Innovation Awards, including its new 
QLED TV line-up; a new Lifestyle TV 
designed to appear just like a picture 
would appear on a wall, the Samsung 
FlexWash + FlexDry,  as well as its 
Chromebook Plus and Pro. 
Honor
Following its launch in the China 
market end of last year, the honor 6X 
made its global debut at CES 2017. 
George Zhao, President of honor, 
shared the growth of honor in the 
United States since its inception into 
the market last year – with the honor 
5X.
The honor 6X features a Bézier 
curved-inspired 
design 
that 
is 
reminiscent of the Earth’s horizon. 
Its 5.5-inch FHD display with 2.5D 
curved glass protection in paired 
with a Huawei Kirin 655 Octa-core 
processor 
and 
Mali-T830 
MP2 
GPU. The 6X is currently running on 
Android 6.0 Marshmallow with its 
proprietary EMUI 4.1, with upgrades 
to Android 5.0 Nougat and EMUI 5.0 
to be rolled out within 2017Q1/2. The 
model comes in two variants: 3GB 
RAM with 32GB storage or 4GB RAM 
with 64GB storage.
While all the details of the model 
had the been out for some time now, 
availability and/or pricing outside of 
China wasn’t made available until its 
product launch event in Las Vegas 
today. Malaysia is included in the 
list of countries where the honor 6X 
will be made available sometime this 
month.
Only the international pricing has 
been made available: US$249.99 and 
US$299.99 (≅ RM1,125 and RM1,350) 
for the 3GB and 4GB variants 
respectively. Given the price different 
between the US market and China 
market (999 Chinese Yuan and 1,599 
Chinese Yuan / ≅ RM647 and RM1,035 
respectively), we anticipate it be fall 
somewhere in the middle. Perhaps

Also available on display was 
the honor Magic, a new generation 
smart device that integrates Tobii 
Eye Tracking features. The device is 
only currently available in China with 
no indications of release into other 
markets. 
Faraday Future
Autonomous cars are gaining traction, 
and Faraday Future plans to bank 
on this upward trend. The company 
unveiled the FF 91, its first production 
vehicle, building upon its Variable 
Platform Architecture (VPA). The 
FF 91 is essentially a fully-electric, 
fully-connected, self-driving, keyless 
vehicle experience with a “driverless 
valet” function that allows the car to 
park itself from your smartphone.
It represents a bold new breed 
of electric mobility that combines 
supercar 
performance, 
precise 
handling, the comfort of an ultra-
luxury passenger vehicle, and a 
unique 
collection 
of 
intelligent 
internet features.
Faraday 
Future’s 
proprietary 
VPA is a flexible powertrain system 
featuring 
a 
monocoque 
vehicle 
structure in which the chassis and 
body are a single form – providing 
measurable improvements in overall 
vehicle rigidity, safety and handling. 
An available all-wheel drive 
system offers greater traction, control 
and precise power distribution. 
The VPA also houses class-leading 
battery technology, multiple motor 
and battery configurations, as well 
as the company’s first patent: the FF 
Echelon Inverter.
Through its strategic partnership 
with LeEco, a global Internet company 
that seamlessly blends devices, 
content, applications and distribution 
into a first-of-its kind ecosystem, 
FF 91 offers the ultimate in-car 
connectivity. FF EcoSystem integrates 
users’ digital lives into FF 91, giving 
access to the apps and content, 
while learning user’s preferences 
over time to create a smarter, more 
personalised experience.
LG 
LG Electronics (LG) took the stage at 
CES 2017 as it unveiled the newest 
top-of-the-line LG SIGNATURE OLED 
TV W -  the pinnacle of the brand’s 
new line-up of flat-panel TVs. 
Deemed as “The Wallpaper TV”, 
the series features Dolby Vision and 
Dolby Atmos sound, with a total of 10 
different models. Its 77-inch model 
boasts of being ultra-thin, in addition 
to winning the 2017 CES Best of 
Innovation Award. 
The brand also highlighted an 
expanded line-up of audio products to 
appeal to a wide range of consumers 
from avid audiophiles to casual 
listeners who prioritise portability 
and versatility. LG’s newest audio 
devices, namely the LG SJ9 sound 
bar and LG LOUDR CJ98, implement 
emerging technologies to maximize 
synergy with LG’s premium TVs and 
to broaden the possibilities of where 
consumers can take their favourite 
music.
ZTE
Using the ever-popular crowdsourcing 
platform Kickstarter, ZTE introduced 
Project CSX (Crowd Source X), which 
entails the ZTE Hawkeye – the world’s 
first crowdsourced phone. The idea, 
design and name of the phone came 
directly from consumers, who are 
engaged in the different phases of 
the project, from selecting materials, 
colours and help contribute software 
for the device. Essentially, ZTE has 
given the reigns to consumers of 
what to build for 2017. 
Following a round of voting 
by consumers representing 176 
countries globally, the consensus was 
to develop a hands-free experience 
for a mobile device. The key features, 
submitted by a team of four creative 
designers who won the Project CSX 
competition, allow an experience 
that does not require the use of 
hands to navigate through common 
smartphone applications:
•   Scrolling based on Eye-Tracking 
By recognising movement of the 
eyes, pages can scroll automatically 
up-down or left-right based on 
movement.  Voice commands can be 
used to navigate between pages. 
•  Stick to Walls and Surfaces with 
Self-Adhesive Case
With an optional case, the phone 
can be mounted to a vertical surface, 
freeing up the need to hold the phone.  
These 
unique 
features 
give 
consumers 
the 
opportunity 
to 
continue use of their phone and 
applications in times when one or 
both hands are otherwise occupied.
Casio
Casio Computer Co., Ltd. announced 
the second addition to its Smart 
Outdoor 
Watch 
category, 
now 
featuring water resistance and tough 
performance for outdoor activities. 
The new WSD-F20 runs on Android 
Wear 2.0 and is equipped with low-
power GPS with a new colour map 
functionality that can be used offline.

the first ever CES (1967) held in New 
York City, United States.

Its predecessor, the WSD-F10, was well-
received as a truly practical wrist device that 
delivers the unique advantages of a wearable 
device for the outdoors. Further improving on its 
success, the all-new WSD-F20 now supports a 
wide range of outdoor and water activities and can 
be used in areas without cellular service, freeing up 
users to fully enjoy their adventures.
In terms of design, button guards, a protective 
bezel, and side buttons of varying sizes enhance 
operability and toughness, making the WSD-F20 
an even more useful piece of outdoor gear. The 
WSD-F20 is positioned in the PRO TREK Smart 
series, the latest addition to the PRO TREK brand 
of outdoor watches by Casio that are designed for 
total appeal to outdoor enthusiasts.
The WSD-F20 will be available in the U.S. market 
on 21 April 2017, retailing for US$500. Its global 
release will possibly happen sometime in May this 
year. No indications if Malaysia will be in the list.
Royole
The Royole Moon, a 3D virtual mobile theatre 
combining 1080p AMOLED displays at over 
3000ppi resolution that simulate a giant 800-inch 
curved screen, with stereoscopic 3D and noise-
cancelling headphones for a completely immersive 
experience.
Panasonic
The Panasonic Lumix GH5 mirrorless camera was 
announced there, that excels at shooting video and 
has 4K and 6K capabilities.
Qualcomm
The first 10 nanometer mobile processor, the 
Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 has enhanced power 
efficiency that helps to create thinner phones with 
longer battery life.
Toyota 
Concept-i, a self-driving car allowing passengers to 
interact with the car’s artificial intelligence agent 
named “Yui,” which anticipates drivers’ needs, 
measures emotions and responds automatically.
Razer
Dubbed Project Valerie, the system is the world’s 
first portable laptop with three built-in monitors. 
Its Project Ariana, on the other hand, takes 
environmental information from within a video 
game and intelligently projects it around a room, 
virtually engulfing a player in real-time action 
previously reserved for on-screen entertainment 
only.
Unfortunately, at the end of CES 2017, Min-
Liang Tan – CEO of Razer – announced on his 
Facebook page that both Project Valerie prototypes 
were stolen from the show floor while the crew 
were packing up for the day. The whereabouts of 
the units are still sketchy at best, with rumours 
that one of the two units appearing for sale on a 
Chinese online shopping portal.

Dell
Bagging seven 2017 CES Innovation Award 
Honorees, Dell was certainly on a streak even 
before the actual show. At the annual showcase, 
the company unveiled a series of world-first 
innovations that are redefining personal computing. 
The entire Dell PC portfolio features Windows 10 
and new 7th Gen Intel Core processors, helping 
people maximise productivity and creativity while 
enjoying lifelike viewing experiences. The unveiling 
include the Dell Canvas - world’s first horizontal 
smart workspace of its kind with touch, totem 
and pen capabilities; Dell Precision All-in- One 
provides best sound of any AIO in the market; Dell 
UltraSharp 32 Ultra HD 8K Monitor - world’s first 
32-inch 8K display; Dell Precision 7720 – its most 
powerful VR-ready mobile workstation; the world’s 
first wireless charging 2-in-1 delivers the ultimate 
“no wires” experience. 
ShowStoppers LaunchIt
Entrepreneurial companies exhibiting at Eureka 
Park, the home for start-ups at CES 2017, also had a 
chance to showcase their expertise. As the official 
pitch event for the showcase, the ShowStoppers 
LaunchIt, saw 12 start-ups pitching their products 
to a standing room-only crowd. First prize was 
awarded to Nonda, makers of a family of connected, 
app-enabled devices for the vehicle. 
Kino-mo, developer of high tech smart 
holographic displays, took second place. Third 
place was awarded to In&Motion, creator of a 
smart wearable that aims to reduce the risk of 
serious injury due to falls.
NVIDIA
Another notable event running con-currently with 
all the media events include the Welcome Keynote 
by NVIDIA founder & CEO Jen-Hsun Huang. Taking 
centre stage, Huang made multiple ground-breaking 
announcements based on the company’s leadership 
in developing advanced graphics processors and 
artificial intelligence.
Mass Effect: Andromeda, a popular video game 
made by BioWare, was previewed by NVIDIA along 
with GeForce NOW, a streaming service that turns 
any PC into a powerful gaming PC from the cloud.
Huang also unveiled a new version of the Shield 
TV – now just called Shield – which will support 
4K HDR for both games and movies making it the 
world’s first 4K HDR entertainment platform. 
To support Shield’s Artificial Intelligence (AI), 
Huang introduced NVIDIA SPOT, a plug-in device 
that understands natural language and complex 
patterns to help build a user’s AI experience. 
In the same vein, he announced an AI car 
supercomputer called Xavier used in NVIDIA’s own 
self-driving car BB8 and a new capability on the 
NVIDIA AI car computer called AI Co-Pilot, which 
provides drivers with road alerts and recognizes 
facial expressions and voice recognition to improve 
drivers’ experience.
He further announced an expanded partnership 
with Audi to develop artificial intelligence for a 
new generation of self-driving cars, with plans to 
have vehicles on the road by 2020. He also provided 
details on partnerships with mapping companies 
HERE and ZENRIN; and two of the world’s largest 
automotive suppliers, ZF and Bosch.

Go for Pro
Sony Playstation 4 Pro
Landslide Popularity 
Given that the Sony PlayStation 
4 Pro (PS4 Pro) made its debut 
in Malaysia just six months ago, 
this particular variant of the ever-
popular gaming console has gained 
immense popularity. So much so 
that it is currently (at the time of 
print) sold out through the country, 
with distributors taking in pre-orders 
slated for delivery sometime in 
2017Q1. I can certainly see the appeal 
of the PS4 Pro as oppose to the con-
currently launched PS4 Slim.  
All About 4K  
The PS4 Pro comes with upgraded 
performance and system 
architecture, thanks to its CPU 
and GPU, to fully deliver better 
graphics and visuals. If you already 
have a 4K TV or monitor, the 
system will automatically render or 
upscale your PS4 titles to a higher 
quality gameplay experience. The 
higher frame rate also contributes 
to better graphic, which I can 
appreciate in more visually detailed 
games. Its streaming applications 
can also now support 4K video 
playback through Netflix and 
YouTube, if you’re keen. So far, I 
can’t seem to tear my eyes away 
from FFXV. 
Same-same but Different
The PS4 Pro sports a similar slanted 
body form factor, but instead of two, it 
consists of three layers of blocks

Really? ”

“Forget I even asked 
that question. FFXV 
looks amazing. ”
FIRST IMPRESSION
“Do I really need 
4K capabilities in 
gaming? ”
24 HOURS EXPERIENCE
Not Yet Upgraded? 
Even if you don’t own a 4K display, 
fret not, the PS4 Pro is still a worthy 
investment. HD TV owners will too 
be able to enjoy enhanced gameplay 
experience. Its delivery of 1080p 
resolution is complemented with a 
higher and more stable frame rate 
for some supported titles. Be warned 
though, older legacy titles may not look 
less awe-inspiring due to this “clarity”. I 
was re-playing Tales of Zesteria, and it 
looked very dated graphically.

VERDICT: “The PS4 Pro futureproofs your console, but at a price” - Atifi
Future-proof Gaming 
According to Sony 
Interactive Entertainment 
(SIE), this is the first time in 
the PlayStation history that 
a higher-end system was 
introduced in the middle 
of the platform’s lifecycle. 
And rightly so, seeing as 
4K digital imaging is fast 
becoming a norm in today’s 
TVs and displays. The 
introduction of the PS4 Pro 
is a move that ensures the 
console remains future-proof 
and relevant with the fast 
adoption of better imaging 
quality.

All-in-One
Unlike the other Fitbit models, 
the Flex 2 comes packaged 
with two band sizes 
Auto Recognition
The SmartTrack feature allows 
the Flex 2 to auto recognise and 
records the exercise you do to 
the app – from running, cycling to 
swimming; a nifty feature since it 
doesn’t have a display
Colour-Coded
The vertical LED display uses 
colour-coded lights to show 
progress toward your daily goal, 
and keeps you connected with call 
and text notifications
Track Your Day
Brandishing a fitness tracker is all the 
rage now and I too have joined the 
bandwagon. I am no closer to losing 
any weight, but tracking my day has 
given me a sense of achievement 
(and justification to have dessert). The 
Fitbit Flex 2 is a great gateway into 
having a tracker, especially if you still 
prefer wearing your good ol’ watch 
and don’t need a heart-rate monitor. 
Slimmer, Sleeker
The Flex 2, as the name suggest, is 
the second generation of the popular 
model. It is 30% slimmer than its 
predecessor and deviates away 
from the conventional band-style 
fitness trackers. The tracker itself can 
be popped in and out of the sleek 
elastomer band with ease, yet still 
remain secure when intended. It is 
also water-resistant and swim-proof 
of up to 50 meters. I’ve taken it into 
the shower and the pool – it works 
swimmingly well. 
Accessorise Your Tracker
The pill/tablet design on the tracker 
allows you to interchange between 
accessories as easy as 1,2,3! Aside 
from the classic elastomer wristbands, 
Fitbit released some luxury 
accessories that will transform your 
Flex 2 from sporty to chic in no time. 
My favourites are the luxe pendants 
and bangles – a great way to jazz up 
your outfit while still tracking your day. 
That said, for the pendants, features 
like SmartTrack and auto sleep 
tracking are disabled.

Comfortable Operations 
Thanks to the design of the watch, 
the Q Wander feels very comfortable 
when worn on the wrist. The Q 
Wander features a metal bracelet 
design, which is a bit more stylish to 
some when compared to a rubber 
strap design. The size of the watch 
may not be for all watch aficionado 
as the watch face is a bit big for slim 
wrists, so this may not appeal to those 
with smaller statures. 
Touch and Gesture 
Everything 
Controlling the Q wander, users have 
several options literally on their wrist. 
The 1.42-inch touch screen is intuitive 
enough that all you need to do is to 
just swipe up/down/left/right to get 
to the important bits that you need 
at that particular time. There is also 
gesture-based control – where one 
just need to flick your wrist in the four 
directions to scroll through the cards 
that appears on screen. There is also 
a button on the side of the watch, 
which acts like a back button. The 
faux-crown is there just for design 
unfortunately.

Almost Depressing
Sony Xperia XZ
Crisp, Sharp & Clear
Being a former Sony Xperia Z3 
owner, one thing I am proud to 
say that Sony does really well is 
its LCD display screens. Dating 
back to the older Z-Series until the 
current X-Series, Sony always outdo 
themselves and the Xperia XZ is no 
exception. Although it is a 1080p 
screen, the 5.2-inch display isn't FHD 
or even QHD for that matter but you 
won't really notice the difference as 
Sony ensures the colour contrast 
in the Xperia XZ is lively, vivid and 
downright outstanding.
Stick To What 
You're Good At
When it comes to creating DSLR 
or even mirrorless cameras, Sony 
has done a very good job for itself 
on that front. Sadly, the same can't 
be said for the cameras featured 
on its smartphone devices as none 
of which have been particularly 
enjoyable to use. Although the 
Xperia XZ does come with a 
23-megapixel rear camera with an 
electronic image stabiliser (EIS), 
it doesn't do itself justice when it 
actually comes to snapping pictures 
as compared to the likes of Huawei 
and Samsung.buttons are easy to 
access… for right-handers (sorry 
southpaws!).
Lasting Longer Than Usual
Much like most smartphone devices 
these days, the Xperia XZ comes 
with an unremovable 2,900mAh 
battery within its core. Although 
not the biggest, it does hold its own 
well enough to last throughout the 
course of the day before needing 
a recharge. What is disappointing 
about the Xperia XZ is that it doesn't 
come with any Fast Charging 
capabilties, unlike its competitors so 
that makes it a bit of a tougher pill 
for customers to swallow. 
Bringing Back
The IP Rating
What Sony failed with 
the Xperia X Compact, 
it definitely made up for 
it with the Xperia XZ as 
it comes with an IP68 
certified rating, ensuring 
it is completely dust proof 
and water-resistant
Staying Away 
From The 
Competition
While most devices 
have its fingerprint 
scanners located either 
on the home button or 
at the rear right below 
the camera, Sony keeps 
itself unique by placing 
the fingerprint scanner 
on the side of the 
device
Same Old, Same Old
One feature that Sony 
has been disappointing 
over and over again is its 
similar, laclustre design 
featured on all its devices; 
the Xperia XZ looks way 
too much like the Z-Series 
aside from the name

VERDICT: “Selfie and Vloggers should take a look at this camera” - Atifi
Lightweight Snapper
Canon EOS M10 Kit (EF-M15-45mm IS STM)
Small, Light and Compact
The Canon EOS M10 is an entry-level 
mirrorless camera within the brand’s 
M-series, so to say that it is can be 
compared to the likes of EOS 5D or 
7D is a bit of stretch. However, for 
users who want a fuss-free device 
that’s sits comfortably in between 
a point-and-shoot and a prosumer 
camera, the M10 does the job and 
more thanks to its feature-packed 
disposition. 
Giving Choice 
Canon offers users three variants of 
the M10 kit – the difference between 
the three are the lenses that comes 
bundled with them. The common 
denominator is the EF-M15-45mm IS 
STM lens that comes with all three of 
them. In most cases, this particular 
lens good for wide portraits shots. 
Taking just this to a big scale event 
like CES 2017, while convenient, 
made me realise that the kit zoom 
lens would’ve come in handy. 
However, that’ll set you back another 
RM1,200, which could get you the 
EOS M3 Kit with EF-M18-55 IS STM 
(and some change). 
Vlogger’s Best Friend
The M10 features a 180° tilt-able 
touchscreen LCD that makes taking 
selfies a breeze. If you’re into 
recording daily vlogs, this particular 
camera will not only make your 
task easier, the quality of the video 
(and photo) is above average for 
uploading. Personally, I hardly used 
the tilt feature throughout the 
review, but can definitely see the 
merits if I was a vlogger (or a selfie 
addict, hmm).  
Side Card
Unlike most digital 
cameras, the EOS 
M10 has a dedicated 
memory card slot on 
the side instead of next 
Get Creative
There are seven built-in 
creative filters to create 
some fun moments. It’s

The Everywhere Compact
Sony RX100 IV
Pocket Friendly Design
This small, magnesium-alloy camera 
fits into pockets easily and the 
smooth, grip-less metal means 
the camera means there’s less for 
your fingers to hold on to but the 
RX100 IV is fairly easy to handle. 
However, a wrist strap is definitely 
recommended to avoid heat of the 
moment accidents. Despite its small 
stature, the manual control dial on 
the back and a wheel around the 
lens means allows you to have full-on 
manual control.  
Eye-Opening Video 
The RX100 IV will record 4K video 
at a very impressive bit rate of 
100Mbps if you have a card fast 
enough but fret not as there a 
plethora of resolution and bitrate 
options for those who don’t wish to 
upgrade to a speedier card. If you 
do have a fast card, the high frame 
rate mode allows you to shoot at 3 
speeds, 250, 500 and 1000 frames 
per second in Full HD! 
Built-in ND Filter
The 3-stop ND filter allows for longer 
exposure times during the day and full use 
of the lens’ capabilities wherever you go
Precise Composition
The pop-up electronic viewfinder reveals the 
subtlest details during composition due to a 
high resolution of 2.3 million dots
Lightning Fast Sensor 
Sony’s new stacked sensor is a 
world first and features higher signal 
processing quality which translates 
to a sensor so fast, it goes beyond 
human perception. This allows for 
a shutter speed of 1/32000 sec, 
40x super slow motion video and 
a burst mode capable of 16fps. 
The incredibly fast shutter speed 
allows for photos that utilise a large 
aperture under extremely bright 
conditions.

Speedy AF
The camera’s autofocus system benefits greatly from the stacked 
image sensor which basically means the camera is now able to 
lock on faster than before with Sony claiming that their AF system 
focuses in 0.09 seconds. The Lock-on AF tracks much faster which 
allows you take full advantage of a photo opportunity. Eye AF is 
finally available in continuous AF mode giving a fast and easy way 
to capture faces on the fly.

Gearing Up For Greatness
Illegear Z5
big as heck
Sleek Metallic Design
What the Z5 lacked in gaming 
performance (which isn't really 
much; I just have insanely high 
standards), it makes up for in its 
unique design. It's 15.6-inch Full 
HD display comes with anti-glare 
capabilities, removing any strain 
from your eyes. It's entire body is 
wrapped in metallic silver with black 
accent finishing, giving off a rugged 
look that says "don't even think 
about messing with me."
Great Keyboard
I am not a fan of laptop keyboards 
in general, I've always preferred the 
use of an external keyboard due to 
my love for mechanical switches. 
With that being said, the keyboard 
on the Z5 does hold its own quite 
well, making it quite comfortable for 
me to type and even game in. This is 
partially due to the large palm rest on 
the body as I have abnormally large 
hands. 
Still Great
The Z5 
comes with 
the GeForce 
GTX1060 
GPU, which 
is currently 
the middle 
of the pack 
for modern 
gaming GPUs
Large 
Touchpad
Another great 
thing about the 
Z5 is its large 
touchpad, which 
is great for 
people like me
Not Enough Ports
With only 3 USB ports available, 
it's not nearly enough for

use an external keyboard and 
mouse while also charging my

Trying To Keep Up
One of the things I admire about 
Illegear is its passion towards 
gaming laptops, especially when I 
had a personal hands-on experience 
with the D9X. Sadly, the same 
can't be said for the Illegear Z5 as 
it just isn't on the same. Although 
it is in the more affordable range 
as compared to the D9X, it just 
barely made the cut after running 
it through the benchmarks tests. 
However, running it on non-graphic 
heavy games like Dota 2, CS:GO 
and Overwatch, the Z5 performs 
exceptionally well with no frame rate 
drops or frame stuttering.

Dual Camera for everyone
Honor 6X
Value performance
Thanks to the HiSIlicon Kirin 655 
processor, the Honor 6X blazes 
through normal apps like it is 
designed to be a faster processor. 
The eight cores certainly helps in this 
regards, as well as the 3GBs of RAM. 
The combination of two ensures that 
the phone does not feel laggy – even 
while playing intensive games on 
the go. Plus, you get an eight-core 
processer at this price! A steal!.
Dual camera magic
Not only you get a very decent 
8-megapixel camera sensor at the 
front for (almost) flawless selfies, 
the dual camera sensor at the back 
gives you a different take on mobile 
photography than before. The 
12-megapixel sensor takes the image, 
while the secondary 2-megapxiel 
sensor records depth information – so 
you can emulate lens bokeh in the 
phone! Artsy images here we come.
Large screen entertainment
The large 5.5-inch full HD display 
on the front means that every 
multimedia file you have stored in 
the phone will look gorgeous and 
expansive, thanks to the large screen. 
While it is no AMOLED display, the 
IPS panel reproduces colour vibrantly 
and consistently – making it a dream 
using it even in the bright sunlight.

Honor opted to 
build the phone in

The sound quality of the Kworld S25

amazing; I could pick up every subtle

comes to drowning out unnecessary 
noise. Running it through my own 
personal playlist, it was particularly 
great when it comes to heavy metal

it didn't do so well for R&B and Hip-
Hop but it was good enough to meet

The Size Of A Bullet
The size of the earcups are literally 
9mm in diameter, making it the 
same size as a bullet. Although the 
design of the S25 isn't for anyone, 
it did strike an appeal for me as 
it definitely stands out from the

Primed & Ready
Wiko UFeel Prime
How Does It Fair?
Having already placed themselves 
in the top 5 of smartphone brands 
across Europe, Wiko is steadily taking 
over the globe, one continent at a 
time. It has now set its sight upon 
Asia as its next target with the Wiko 
UFeel Prime, it's premium flagship 
device with entry-level to mid-range 
specifications. We take the UFeel 
Prime for a run through the lab to see 
how it would fair.
Not Quite What I Expected 
To hear of a brand that broke into 
the top 5 smartphone brands in 
Europe, you would expect it to be 
within the same grasp as the other 
frontrunners. Sadly on that front, 
Wiko still has much to do. Although 
the benchmark scores say otherwise 
(its very subpar), day-to-day usage 
of the UFeel Prime is perfectly fine, 
capable of running multiple apps at 
once without any lag issues.
Easy Access To Your Apps
One feature from the UFeel Prime 
that I did find quite useful was its 
customisable fingerprints, which 
allows you to alocate one fingerprint 
for a specific app. Now you can have 
five apps ready and raring to go 
with just a touch. However, I don't 
agree with the placement of the 
fingerprint scanner as I am far more 
accustomed to it being at the back 
of the device rather than the front.

The rear camera 
on the UFeel 
Prime comes with 
a 13-megapixel

Straight Out Of 
A Sci-Fi Movie
Looking much more like an alien 
rather than a predator (fans of the 
movie will get what I mean), the 
Acer Predator G1 comes with a 
ferocious outlook, much like an alien 
spaceship from the distant future. Its 
casing is somewhat reminiscent of 
the exoskeleton you can see in the 
Transformers movie series, particularly 
the Decepticons due to its menacing 
and evil outlook. Although great to 
look at intially, it did slowly grow on 
me and I got accustomed to it.
Behaves Like A Predator
This pint-sized behemoth is not to 
be messed with; the outstanding 
component would be the inclusion 
of the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 
GPU, giving you VR-ready capabilities 
so you can game with a next-level 
immersive experience. The G1 is also 
packed with the 6th Gen. Intel Core 
i7-6700 quad-core processor for even 
quicker and smoother daily usability. 
In terms of storage, the G1 is capable 
of holding up to 512GB of SSD storage 
while also coming with standardised 
2TB HDD.
Putting It Through The Test
It was pretty exciting to run the 
G1 through the benchmarks tests 
to see how well it would fair and 
sadly, it didn't really live up to the 
expectations I've come to set from 
Acer. Although I'm pretty sure the G3 
and G6 would've done a much better 
job, the G1 just pales in comparison as 
even running it through the Rise of the 
Tomb Raider benchmark, it topped up 
at just under 60 FPS, which is pretty 
disappointing for a system running on 
the latest GPU.

VERDICT: 
Not Enough Ports
Thanks to the inclusion of the GTX 
1080 GPU, it makes the G1 VR-ready, 
which means more ports will be taken 
up for the VR headset and such. With 
only four USB ports located at the 
back of the casing and an additional 
port located at the front, it surely 
doesn't seem like much. The silver 
lining is the inclusion of the USB 
Type-C port located at the front of the 
casing, allowing you to charge your 
smart device without having to move 
from the PC.
Superior Gaming Out of the Box
Unlike the typical generic accessories that you will usually get (which I hate), the G1 provides you with the Predator 
Flare mechanical keyboard with customisable backlight keys and a Predator gaming mouse. Although not as audible as 
Cherry MX switches, the keys on the Predator Flare are much softer than expected; it also makes typing much easier. 
Personally, I'm not a fan of the Predator gaming mouse as its much smaller compared to plenty of other brands so my 
palm fully covers the mouse, making my movements slow and uncomfortable.  
Quicker and Easier 
Networking
Thanks to the installation 
of the Killer DoubleShot 
Pro, the G1 can intelligently 
split your LAN data 
between cable and 
wireless connections 
for optimised Internet 
connectivity
Unorthodox Power 
Source
Much like laptops, the G1 is 
powered by two seperate 
power bricks, which must 
be plugged into the back 
of the casing for it to work
Boost Your Sound
In order to take the advantage on the 
battlefield, the G1 comes equipped 
with the SoundBlaster X-Fi MB5 with 7.1 
channel audio.

Covering All Angles
Aztech Full HD Wireless IP Camera w/ Pan & Tilt 
(WIPC411HD) 
Flexible Monitoring
The Aztech IP Cam App allows you 
to connect four wireless IP cameras. 
They don’t all have to be in the 
same location; in theory, you could 
connect the ones in your office and 
a home simultaneously – as long 
as their IP addresses have been 
registered to your app. This makes 
monitoring or surveillance much 
easier. 
Up, Down, Left, Right
The WIPC411HD is useful to have if 
you’d like an eagle-eye view of its 
surrounding. It can pan up to 355° 
and tilt 120°, which can be controlled 
through the app in real time, so you’ll 
be able to see most angles. If you 
catch your colleague dozing off, there 
is a built-in speaker to gently remind 
them that “big brother is watching”. 
Well, they could also try to give their 
excuse back at you since the camera 
has an internal mic.  
Day & Night
It doesn’t just 
provide clear and 
crisp footage in 
good lighting, the 
WIPC411HD has a 
built-in infrared LED, 
which means night 
time monitoring is 
possible
Direct Recording

Feeling Youthful? I Think Not
Gamdias HEBE M1
Booming Bass Drops
Whether it's listening to electronic, 
heavy metal or even EDM, the 
Gamdias HEBE M1 has a booming 
bass drop that just can't be found 
in any other pair of headphones. 
Even when gaming, the M1 gives 
great audio feedback, allowing you 
to catch even the faintest hints of 
your surroundings, making it almost 
impossible for your enemies to sneak 
up on you.
Insanely Huge Driver Unit 
The M1 comes with a 50mm HD 
driver unit, providing realistic sound 
effects with a rich bass. They weren't 
lying when they said it was HD; 
running the M1 through my playlist 
never sounded so good before. I 
tested out the M1 for Skyrim and 
Uncharted 4; the ambience noise 
is amazing on them. Pristine and 
crystal clear, you can pick up birds 
chirping from afar while still being 
totally focused on the mission.
Too Damn Huge
One thing I thoroughly dislike about 
the M1 is its size. Although It does 
perform well on a day-to-day basis, 
its far too heavy to have on one's 
head for long hours, especially if 
you're a hardcore gamer like me. 
Not even after an hour I could feel 
the pressure around my ears as well 
as my head due to its sheer weight

Sound is Vital
Zowie Vital 
Plug-and-Play Instantly
With most generic USB sound cards 
coming with drivers and programs 
that have to be installed before being 
able to use them, the Zowie Vital 
comes with a quick plug-and-play 
method so you don't have to waste 
time looking for the driver or program. 
On the touchscreen display, you can 
adjust the volume, microphone, treble 
and bass levels of your headset with 
just a push of a button.
Not As Interactive 
As You Think
Although it does sound like a great 
device, the Zowie Vital has a lot to 
work on before it becomes a hit. 
For one, the response time for the 
interactive touchscreen is pretty 
slow; I have to press on bass a few 
times before it actually responds 
and don't get me started on how 
I managed to control the volume. 
Although not as annoying as most 
people would think, I'd like to be 
able to change my audio settings 
quickly and without any delay.
Take Your Pick
If you prefer to not have your 
headset blaring but your speakers 
instead, you can choose to latter 
as the Zowie Vital comes with 3 
audio ports in total for your headset, 
microphone and of course your 
speakers. To switch, just press the 
speaker button on the touchscreen 
and your music will be redirected to 
the speakers that are plugged in. You 
can also lock the screen to reduce 
the amount of light coming from it 
or even mute your microphone.

Let The Alien Secure Your Network
DLINK AC5300
MIMO King
1000Mbps is the theoretical speed 
that the AC5300 can deliver over 
the 2.4Ghz band – of course it is 
depending on the wireless card that 
you have in your device. The upside 
of this high connectivity is that the 
data stream is constant and consistent 
even at high transfer loads. Plus, the 
router supports Multiple In Multiple Out 
(MIMO), and the eight antenna helps (it 
is not just for show!).
Connectivity King
You get not two, but three Wifi 
Band – 2.4GHz and two 5GHz bands 
for better data transfer with high-
performance devices. Of course, 
there is also the ports at the back 
when you need wired connections. 
You get four Gigabit ethernet ports, 
a USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 port and 
a physical switch that allows the 
AC5300 to work as a router or a 
range extender.
Customization King
Not only the router works great with 
the included software, it is also able 
to support DD-WRT OpenSource 
Linus that allows advanced users to 
install custom firmware when it is 
needed. The standard UI is simple 
to use but also feature an extensive

With the help from Logitech

reduces the amount of force needed 
to click, allowing you to get more 
done in a shorter amount of time.
Game Longer Without 
Wires 
Thanks to the wireless capabilities 
on the G900, you can now game  
up to 32 hours straight on a single 
charge. This is because of the 
exclusive clock-tuning technology, 
which significantly reduces power 
consumption. Although it didn't last 
me the full 32 hours (mainly because 
I kept forgetting to turn it off), it did 
last a bit over 24 hours before having 
to recharge so it does live up to its 
name of being long-lasting.
Perfect For The Pros  
If you're ever considering of 
breaking into the pro scene, the 
G900 is a great mouse for that. 
Its dpi ranges from 200 to 12,000 
with zero smoothing, filtering or 
acceleration so you have complete 
control over your movements. This 
is great especially for FPS gamers as 
movement, precision and accuracy is

upon closer inspection, we were 
surprised that it’s actually rated at

360fly 4K
Standard mountings  
The 360fly 4K is one of the many 
360-degree cameras that is now

this camera different is the design – 
the lens is situated on the top of the

comes with a standard 1/4inch 
thread so it can be screwed into any

All-around photo 
Connect the 360fly 4K to your

comment is that the pairing step can 
take a bit of time to establish – we 
once had to wait over 30 seconds for 
the app to see the camera. But once 
it is set up, the image taking is as 
simple as pressing a button. 
Simple operation  
The 360fly 4K is easy to use, as 
there is no other button than the 
power/record button on the unit 
itself. It is purely done with the app, 
so the operator can be away from 
the device as it records. Plus, the 
64GB of internal storage means that 
your 4K video files will have enough 
space in the device even if you are 
away from a computer for the day.

Oh, Brother
Brother MFC-L5900DW 
Laser Quality Text
If you’re looking for a constantly 
smooth and crisp printing for 
documents, the monochrome 
multifunction printer Brother MFC-
L5900DW is your best bet. The 
printer certainly makes printing out 
a 30-page test document (i.e. my 
report) a breeze. The first printout 
seems to be fairly quick at 7 to 8 
seconds, with the subsequent pages 
following suit right after without a 
hitch.  
A Tad Disappointing  
However, when it comes to printing 
out images, pictures and graphics, 
there were a lot of details lost when 
it is converted to monochrome. 
If you’re thinking of printing 
presentation slides in black and 
white, you may want to do a quick 
test print before proceeding with 
the lot. That said, in a traditional 
office setting, printing out images 
in monochrome isn’t a norm so this 
Connecting Woes
I had intended to connect the MFC-
L5900DW to our office network 
through Wi-Fi, but due to some 
incompatibility with our router at the 
time, it was proving to be a challenge. 
I personally feel that to maximise its 
potential in bigger offices, technicians 
from Brother need to be the ones 
setting up the system. It is definitely 
not for small-to-medium businesses 
who want a plug-and-play kind of 
device.

 Maximising Print Productivity
Canon MAXIFY MB5470 
Maximum Speed  
 The MB5470 delivers fast print 
speeds: printing a 30-page 
monochrome report was done in 
about a minute with minimal warm-
up. It comes equipped with a wider 
print head, and this is paired with a 
unique overlapping paper feeding 
technology. The printer draws the 
second sheet to be printed and 
overlaps it with the first sheet, which 
increases the print speed. A very 
good performance for something its 
size.
True to Colour  
The MB5470 delivers more than 
just crisp and darker than black ink 
printouts, its coloured printing is 
no lightweight either. The colours 
are vibrant without oversaturating 
the paper. While the first printout 
for colour takes a little longer 
but significantly faster than its 
competitors. At most, you’ll have to 
wait for 10 seconds before it comes 
out.  
Easy Set-Up  
What I found to be a boon for the 
MB5470 is how easy it was to set-up. 
Connecting a new printer and have it 
seen across the network – especially 
wirelessly – can be a pain in the 
arse. The instructions provided were 
more than sufficient for me to set 
it up as a network printer via Wi-Fi 
connectivity quickly and swiftly.

o, you have only about 700 ringgit in your pocket, and you need to find a smartphone to replace 
the one that just tanked in your hands. You go to the shops and expect at that price range, you 
may get a lemon – you would be surprised. The market for phones under the RM 700 ringgit mark 
has grown to the point that some models have features that was previously only available in flagship 
devices. Brands Like Samsung, Wiko, HTC, Xiaomi, Honor and Lenovo all has models that is available 
for less than a quarter of a top-tier flagship – and they are capable smartphones of their own as well.

Samsung J2 Prime
he entry from the largest smartphone manufacturer is also the larger 
models in this month’s showdown. The Samsung J2 Prime brings to the 
table a few features that is not shared with the other competitors in the 
list. Unfortunately, one of the feature that Samsung used in this phone 
is the non-HD screen – at only 540 x 960 pixels ; this low-resolution screen may 
be a detractor for some potential customers to purchase this phone for their use. 
T
Other features that the phone offers are almost similar with the rest. It has 
a 5-inch display that is becoming the accepted benchmark for smartphones these 
days. The screen itself supports 10-point multitouch so you are ensured that your 
experience using the phone will be good – regardless where you touch on the 
screen. 
At 160 grams, it is the heaviest among the entrants in this showdown – 
and we wish that Samsung could have slimmed it down a bit more so it can be 
lighter in the hands. The processor on the Samsung Galaxy J2 Prime is a quad-
core processor form MediaTek, running at 1.4Ghz. It is more that enough to power 
your apps, listen to music and take photos. 
Talking about taking photos, the Samsung galaxy J2 Prime features an 
8-megapixel rear camera, that is paired to a f/2.2 lens that helps in low-light 
imaging situations. The low megapixel count makes the J2 Prime trailing in the 
rear for image quality but if you are only looking to take a quick snap for simple 
social media sharing – it just covers the basic. 
Other notable features include dual SIM standby, with one of the SIM tray 
doubling as the memory slot for a microSD slot – if one needs to expand the 
internal 8GB storage. On the selfie front – the J2 Prime comes with a 5-megapixel 
camera sensor that includes both a fast f/2.2 lens as well as a front LED flash as 
well to brighten up your selfie game. So go ahead and take your selfie in a dark 
place – the wide aperture lens and the LED flash will give you more backup for 
great selfies with your friends or loved ones.
Using the J2 Prime is like any other Samsung – the TouchWiz interface 
overlaying Android 6.0 Marshmallow is simple to use and looks great on the 
screen. Samsung did say that the phone will be getting Android 7.0 Nougat at 
the time of printing, so the phone is futureproof for buyers who are purchasing 
them today.

Wiko ufeel Go
or something a bit different, we present to you the Wiko ufeel Go. The 
smaller of the two latest phones from Wiko represents a nice smartphone 
that anyone can jump onto if they are looking to invest in their first 
smartphone. Not only the price point for this model is attractive, it has 
features and even looks like it is taken from a high-end smartphone model. 
F
Underneath the seemingly metal body is the MediaTek MT6735 processor, 
which is a quad-core chip making it a good fit for most apps on the Google Play 
Store. You do get only 2GB of RAM, but to some it is more than enough if they do 
not open too many apps at the same time. 
You get a 5-inch screen that is a 720p panel – which is decent enough for 
usage by most users out there. It is not a full HD screen, but on the upside, it 
gives the phone better battery life thanks to the lower resolution that it needs to 
draw on screen. 
It is also one of the heaviest in the bunch at 172 grams and even then it 
comes with a party trick – you can remove the whole back of the phone. This is a 
feat seeing that the phone’s back is made from metal. Underneath the removable 
back is a non-removable battery, as well as the slots for two SIM cards as well 
as a microSD card. 
MediaTek supplied the MT6735 processor for the phone, which consists of 
four Cortex A53 cores. The chip also gives the phone LTE capabilities that is useful 
when you are on the go. Not only that, there is a 4000mAh battery powering 
everything so you are sure to enjoy a whole day of using the phone while you are 
out and about. 
Imaging with the Wiko is also good, thanks to the 13-megapixel camera at 
the back of the phone. It can also take full HD video, but no 4K footage. For selfies, 
the 5-megapixel shooter serves the purpose to capture you and your friends when 
you are out and about in the city. 
Surprisingly the Wiko ufeel Go feels very substantial in the hand as the curve 
and design of the phone is very conducive in give the most comfortable handhold. 
There are no sharp edges on the phone, and the 2.5D glass looks like it is taken 
straight from a high-end device. Plus, the Wiko even comes with a fingerprint 
scanner, making it one of the few mid-tier smartphones to feature it at its price 
point.

Xiaomi Redmi 3S
f you are ok with a name that is always associated with China, check out 
the Xiaomi Redmi 3S. This phone is the company’s current small offering, 
but don’t let the small size fool you. The Xiaomi Redmi 3S looks smart, has 
high-end features and can last for a long time on a single charge – which 
what users want to see in a smartphone these days.
I
With a 5-inch display, it is par for the course for the Redmi 3S when compared 
with the other phones in the line-up. The screen is thankfully a 720p variant, so 
the resolution of content on screen will still be generally legible. While it is no 
high-resolution screen, the screen gives a balance between quality and battery 
life as the phone will not draw too much power thanks to the lower resolution 
screen. 
Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 430 beats in the heart of the phone. It is one of the 
few phones at this price point that is pushing its 64bit processing capabilities, 
so it has a bit of a leg up when you need to use an app in a higher bit mode. At 
144 grams, the Xiaomi Redmi 3S is quite light in the hand, and the all metal build 
makes it feel like it is a higher tier phone rather than the mid-tier phone it is. 
Imaging with the Xiaomi Redmi 3S is generally a good one thanks to the 
13-megapixel camera at the back that also features Phase Detect Auto Focus 
(PDAF) system, which promises a better autofocus lock when used. In practise, it 
is quite remarkable that the images that it takes are of very acceptable quality, 
although it is not the best that we have seen so far. The f/2.0 lens helps in low 
light situations as well. 
The Redmi 3S comes with a dual-SIM solution, which gives the phone the 
ability to tap into two different lines at the same time. It also accepts external 
additional storage through the microSD slot, but this will take up one of the two 
SIM slots in the hybrid dual SIM tray that Xiaomi elected to use with this phone. 
Security is paramount these days for smartphone users – this is why the 
fingerprint scanner that is on the Xiaomi Redmi 3S is fast and accurate. This will 
give users a piece of mind over their sensitive information on their smartphone. 
Plus, you can also add layers of security with smart features like App lock, Hidden 
folders and Hidden notes that is tied to a fingerprint scan.

Honor 5A
he Honor brand has a good amount of following in Malaysia, so it is 
no surprise that they are actively pushing their branding through their 
smartphone here in Malaysia. One of the segments they are strong is the 
mid-tier market, and their offerings for this market is almost second to 
none. The Honor 5A is their model in this every growing market, and what it brings 
to the table is something interesting to all parties to consider. 
T
At 5.5-inch, the Honor 5A has the largest screen among the contenders here, 
but it shares the 720p resolution with many of its competitors in the market. 
While this is an IPS display, the larger screen does mean that the screen clarity is 
not as sharp as a phone with a smaller display. However, Honor has managed to 
create a balance between quality and sharpness for day-to-day use. 
Huawei has elected to fit the Honor 5A with its own silicon. The Kirin 620 
from HiSIlicon is an eight-core SoC, built with 64bit computing in mind. The SoC 
has a good power consumption rate that ensures the battery of the Honor 5A does 
not die too fast throughout the day. The battery at 3100mAh is not the largest in 
the line-up, but it can last for a whole working day with no problem at all, thanks 
to the Kirin processor. 
With 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage, the phone has enough memory to 
run all of your apps that you need. Of course, if you need to have more storage, 
the microSD slot can support up to 128GB for more space for your multimedia or 
apps, which the large screen is definitely suitable thanks to its large size. Plus, if 
you need to have two lines running at the same time, the dual SIM slots will give 
you the ability to plug in the lines that you need, which is especially convenient 
when travelling. 
Imaging with the Honor 5A is good, thanks to the 13-megapixel sensor on 
the back, and 8-megapixel sensor for selfie purposes. It is par for the course at 
least on paper, and the photos taken with the cameras are not too shabby either. 
The large size of the phone may turn off some users, but others may see the 
advantage of having a larger screen as well. Smaller hands may want to use this 
phone with two hands, but for the most part, the phone is comfortable to use in 
the hands. We wish the design is a bit less blocky though – more curves would 
be nice.

Lenovo A6600 Plus
ne of the biggest manufacturer of computer products in the world, 
Lenovo has fingers in just about every pie out there – from desktop 
workstations to portable machines for the office worker on the go. Their 
brand of smartphones are not too bad as well, with good performers in 
every level. The Lenovo A6600 Plus is one of the models we are quite happy with, 
thanks to its mix of performance, specs and looks. 
O
The front of the phone is a curious mix of both Lenovo as well as the company 
that they bought over – Motorola. There are hints of design here and there, the 
A6600 Plus is still a handsome phone to look at and to be seen with. Its 5-inch 
screen is similar to the other phones in the line-up, and feature the same 720p 
resolution as the other phones. More than decent for normal daily use we reckon. 
Running everything is the MediaTek MT6735p processor. This is a quad-core 
chip and is just enough for most apps to run with. It is not the fastest or the 
greatest chip in the bunch, but it does what it does without too much complaint. 
You will get 2GB of RAM with each A6600 Plus, and 16GB of on-board storage 
for your media files and apps. Par for the course really. Also, the phone features 
a microSD slot for times you need to expand your storage for more content to be 
displayed on your screen. Like the others here, the A6600 Plus also feature Dual 
SIM capabilities, so you can have two lines running at the same time. 
142 grams weight means that A6600 Plus will not stand out too much in this 
crowd, but the small 2300 mAh battery will. In the time where users routinely 
see 3000 mAh batteries as norm, the small battery capacity will be a sore point. 
Fortunately Lenovo has opted to have the phone feature removable batteries so 
that you can have a spare battery charged up to swap as the main one dies in the 
middle of the day. 
Using the phone is quite ok, as the mid-tier size means that the phone will 
not feel too off in the hands, and there are enough design elements that gives the 
phone a more handsome look and feel in the hands. It will not win any pageant, 
but it should work without too much fault on a daily basis.

The field of mid-tier smartphones is a big one, as while the flagships will rule the roost, it is the mid-tiers where all the pickings and peckings happen. Consumer who 
are not looking to spend thousands of ringgit in a smartphone will gravitate to the mid-tier market to fulfil their needs of a communications device that will not drain their 
wallet or their bank account. Because of that, the choice of which is the best model is a tough one to make, but after considerations and a discussion among peers, we 
have chosen the Xiaomi Redmi 3S as the winner of the showdown for the month. The main reason is that the model offers the best value for the buck, and at the same 
time gives the best performances for the price one pay for the phone. The rest were close, but this model edges the competition just that bit that it won the showdown in 
PC.com. If you need a second option, the Wiko ufeel Go is a great purchase as well, thanks to its combination of performance, price and looks.

Composition Techniques for Wide-Angle Lenses
While wide-angle lenses are able to capture a wider range than standard lenses, they have the rather unique characteristic of perspective exaggeration that 
appears due to the special effect of convergence. In Part 1, I explained the different photographic effects of wide-angle lenses. Here in Part 2, I will help you get a 
better grasp of the characteristics of wide-angle lenses by showing you various photos that were taken in wide angle.

Have fun with strong perspective exaggeratioN
To enjoy the characteristics of wide-angle lenses to the fullest, try approaching 
your subject from the diagonal. By composing the subject such that it protrudes 
into the frame as you approach, it will appear to come from the edge of the 
image, creating a strongly exaggerated perspective.
A nightscape of a factory in Kawasaki city, taken with my wide-angle lens 
(FL: 23mm). I got right up close to the fence, which would normally be an 
irritating obstruction. The distance between my lens and the fence was almost 
zero in this photo. When up close like this, the intense perspective exaggeration 
of the fence has a strong impact, which might even be overpowering for the 
viewer. On the other hand, the factory in the distance, near the centre of the 
image, does not evoke as strong a sense of perspective exaggeration.
I took a shot of a plate of oysters at an oyster bar (FL: 16mm). Here too, I got 
right up close until my lens was just about touching the shells in the foreground. 
The exaggerated perspective is stretched across the plate from the foreground 
into the background.
Suggest expanse with exaggerated perspectives
Creating perspective exaggeration with a wide-angle lens evokes a sense of 
expansiveness in your photos. When you use a wide-angle lens in a scene of 
plants growing en masse, such as when taking photos of flowers, the resulting 
photos will evoke a greater sense of expansiveness than that which you can 
see with your own eyes.

In this example, the photo somehow gives the impression that it was taken in an entire 
field of flowers -  yet it was actually a cluster of small planters with a depth of around 
30 to 40cm inside a park. I took this shot right up close to the flowers with a focal 
length of 24mm.
Next, I also took this close-up shot of flowers using a wide-angle lens (FL: 
16mm). The perspective is thoroughly exaggerated from the foreground towards the 
background, giving the impression of an expansive garden of flowers.
Incidentally, the image here is of the same location seen from further back.
I actually took this shot using the same focal length of 16mm while standing 
up. However, the photo looks completely different. While the photo shows the 
overall appearance of the park, it is not clear what the subject of the shot is.

This shot is of the Minato Mirai area in Yokohama, taken from a boat at sunset

dividing the lower third of the photo from the upper two thirds.

blossoms.

Capture an expansive sky
When you take photos of a cloudy sky with a wide-angle lens, the sky will appear big and expansive. This is because of exaggerated perspective caused by the 
downward stretching that occurs from the top edge of the image. On a clear day the exaggerated perspective is not as apparent due to the lack of contrast in the 
sky, whereas, it is more pronounced when beautiful clouds are present. Therefore, you might want to actively place the sky in view when composing your shots.

I took this shot with the camera placed on the ground (FL: 16mm). This gives the 
floor an expansive appearance. However, when shooting in a low position, take 
careful note of your surroundings beforehand so as not to have your intentions 
misunderstood. Particularly for low position, low angle shooting around town, a 
good idea would be to make sure that no one is nearby.
Make legs look longer and better show off a subject’s figure
You can make the most of the extreme perspective exaggeration of wide-angle 
lenses to make people’s legs appear longer. For example, here is a low-angle 
shot looking up at a standing boy, with an exaggerated perspective in the 
upward direction from the feet at the bottom edge of the image. This makes his 
face appear smaller, thereby making the legs appear larger than they actually 
are.
In such cases, you should be careful not to place the face in the outer periphery 
of the image, as the face might become unnecessarily distorted. This is because 
perspective exaggeration is not as strong in the centre of the image.
This technique is used to better show off a subject’s figure and sense of style 
in portraits.
In this article, I introduced several characteristic photos taken using a wide-
angle lens. I’m sure that once you have mastered perspective exaggeration, 
you’ll have fun shooting with wide-angle lenses.
EOS 5D Mark III/ EF16-35mm f/2.8L USM/ f/4.0 / 1/40sec / ISO 800
Try using a low shooting position
It is interesting to use a low shooting position with wide-angle lenses that 
create strong exaggerated perspectives of subjects in the foreground. Taking 
shots from a low position means that you inevitably have to get close to the 
ground, and therefore can have fun with the expansiveness of the ground.
EOS 5D Mark II/ EF24-105mm f/4L USM/ f/8.0 / 1/250sec / ISO 200
EOS 5D Mark III/ f/4.0 / 1/160sec / ISO 1250
Incidentally, low shooting angle and low shooting position are two very different 
things. Low angle refers to shots that are taken at an angle looking upward (as 
opposed to high angle), whereas low position simply refers to the camera being 
in a position lower than eye level. In the photo above, the camera is not only 
in a low position, but it is also pointing down towards the ground, making it a 
low-position, high-angle shot.

conjunction 
with 
this 
year’s Fuji Xerox Innovation 
Showcase, Fuji Xeox Asia 
Pacific launches its new line 
of innovative document manage 
solutions, powered by the new 
Smart Work Gateway Concept. This 
new concept by Fuji Xerox supports 
diverse 
workstyles 
to 
enable 
business persons to perform their 
utmost capability by collaborating 
with cloud service partners while 
also offering various communication 
tools tailored to suit individual needs 
and preferences.
Through the Smart Work Gateway 
concept, Fuji Xerox is also introducing 
 Fuji Xerox comes out with 14 multifunction devices known as the new Smart Work 
Gateway concept
Work Faster and 
Smarter
I
14 models of cloud-friendly, digital 
colour multifunction devices under 
its ApeosPort-VI C / DocuCentre-
VI series. This new series creates 
a 
communication 
environment 
that improves productivity in the 
workplace by integrating the Cloud 
Service Hub – a new platform that 
links the multifunction devices with 
multiple de facto standard cloud 
services. You can now log into the 
cloud services through a single sign-
on, which then allows you to scan or 
save the documents from the cloud. 
The documents can also be cross-
searched across the cloud services 
linked to the Cloud Service Hub, 
thus contributing to the business 
process improvement.
What makes all of this possible 
is through the Fuji Xerox Direct 
Management Console, a free software 
that displays the contents of the Fuji 
Xerox Direct – a portal that provides 
Fuji Xerox’s various Internet services 
– on client PCs. Through the software, 
you can now purchase, download and 
install apps for multifunction devices 
from the Internet in a centralised 
manner. With the Fuji Xerox Direct 
Management Console being used from 
a PC, multiple multifunction devices 
can be simultaneously managed and 
configured, providing rapid adaptation 
in the event of sudden changes in 
working processes.
“The Smart Work Gateway was 
developed in response to the rapidly 
growing demands of our customers 
– 
demands 
that 
conventional 
multifunction 
devices 
alone 
are 
unable to meet,” said Masashi Honda, 
President and Chief Executive Officer, 
Fuji Xerox Asia Pacific. “Based on this 
concept, Fuji Xerox underscores its role 
in accelerating business efficiencies. 
We will continue to expand the 
ecosystem 
through 
collaborations 
with more partners, enhancing the 
role of a multifunction device into a 
communications portal.”

Digital data management key in advancing 
digital economies within ASEAN
Pro-growth digital data management policy important in developing the regional economic vision
new report titled ‘The 
Digital 
Economy 
and 
the Free Flow of Data: 
Advancing 
the 
ASEAN 
Economic Community’ was presented 
in collaboration by the US-ASEAN 
Business Council and Delloitte to 
the Malaysian government and 
the local business community. The 
reports highlights steps that can be 
taken by ASEAN member states to 
advance their digital economies and 
the ASEAN Economic Community 
through pro-growth data digital 
management policies. 
Speaking 
at 
the 
event, 
Ambassador 
Michael 
Michalak, 
Seniro Vice President and Regional 
Managing Director of the US-ASEAN 
Business Council said,” The digital 
economy plays a strategic role as 
a critical enabler for deepening 
ASEAN regional integration and as 
well as helping drive next generation 
domestic demand led growth for 
startups and SME's.”
“Regional integration and the digital 
economy are both big opportunities in 
what is one of the world’s fastest growing 
regions. All manner of business, from the 
start-up to the regional champion as 
well as the multinational, will benefit 
if the AEC framework puts the digital 
economy front & center. Now is the 
time to do so,” Jeff Pirie, AEC Leader, 
Deloitte Southeast Asia, added later.
The US- ASEAN Business Council 
and Deloitte forum was hosted at 
Microsoft’s office, and included a 
panel discussion on Malaysia’s digital 
A
economy and how the findings of the 
report can best be applied to support 
growth and innovation in Malaysia. 
The report was developed by the

 IT Decentralization gaining traction for 
digital business innovation in Malaysia
VMware introduces Evolved Cloud Strategy to address the matter to the local market 
uided with insight from the 
“VMware State of the Cloud 
2016” 
research 
report, 
VMware highlighted that 
IT departments are being sidestepped 
by business leaders who adopt their 
own cloud-based technologies to 
innovate faster and meet growth 
objectives. VMware shared that one 
of the most significant impediments 
to digital business innovation in 
Malaysia is the decentralization 
of IT and its detrimental effect on 
enterprise operations.
VMware’s State of the Cloud 
2016 research found that enterprises 
in Malaysia face high levels of IT 
decentralization, with more than 85 per 
cent of local respondents – one of the 
highest in the Asia Pacific and Japan 
region – agreeing that the purchasing 
and management of IT are taking place 
outside of IT’s purview.
“As Malaysian companies race to 
compete in the global digital economy, 
the research findings validate what 
we’ve been hearing from our customers 
across the region – most organizations 
have a hybrid cloud environment, with 
workloads and applications across 
different platforms. The challenge 
for local CIOs is to continue enabling 
their companies to innovate and meet 
growth objectives, and yet effectively 
manage and secure applications 
dispersed 
across 
multiple 
cloud 
environments. VMware Cross-Cloud 
Architecture responds directly to 
this challenge by offering cloud 
freedom and control,” said Alex 
Loh, country manager, Malaysia and 
Brunei, VMware.
To help businesses, VMware 
has 
extended 
the 
company’s 
hybrid cloud strategy with the 
VMware Cross-Cloud Architecture, 
enabling 
customers 
to 
run, 
manage, connect, and secure their 
applications across clouds and 
devices in a common operating 
environment. In addition, VMware 
Cloud Foundation offers a new “as-
a-service” option that delivers the 
full power of the software-defined 
data center (SDDC) in a hybrid 
cloud environment.

Fortinet urges companies to review network 
security in preparation of Internet of Things (IoT)
Increased security risks expected in the new era of interconnected devices
ortinet, the global leader 
in high-performance cyber 
security solutions, warns that 
the IoT revolution is poised to bring 
new challenges to network security. 
Connectivity is no longer limited 
to high-end technology consumers 
(watches and drones), but nearly 
everything - from children’s toys 
to kitchen appliances and media 
devices. Purchasers of these new 
technology-enabled products are 
far from security experts or even 
security aware. 
Market

Gartner 
predicts that by 2020, humans will 
each have 26 connected devices 
that gather, send, and correlate 
data. For enterprises, this means

F
Data Centres: Digital Enablers of 
the Economy
Malaysia ripe to take advantage of regional data centre growth
very post you hit ‘Like’ on 
Facebook or every picture you 
post on Instagram requires 
a place to store all that data 
and information. Everybody know it 
is thanks to the Internet, but where 
does all that information go? The 
most popular answer would be ‘cloud’, 
when in fact, everything is stored in 
many centralised repository locations 
known as data centres.
With more information being 
created every second around the 
world, more storage space is required, 
which in turn demands the creation of 
more data centres.
In light of this, Malaysia Digital 
Economy 
Corporation 
(MDEC) 
highlights how Malaysia needs more 
data centres built locally in order to 
E
era of technology personalization 
are both significant and unplanned. 
With the advent of IOT, employees 
will simply sync their personal 
smart devices, connect to the 
corporate WiFi network and even 
remotely connect to the cloud-
based services deployed across the 
corporate network.
“The emergence of IoT is 
pushing security from being a 
network afterthought and bolt-on 
technology to an integral, persistent, 
omnipresent part of the network. The 
1980s approach to install an MDM 
client on smartphones and tablets, 
which we still do today, just isn’t 
an option for IOT devices. Secured, 
trustworthy networking is preferred 
over networking plus security. To 
limit the scope and exposure of an 
exploited device, we need to create 
even smaller security domains,” said 
Michelle Ong, Country Manager for 
Fortinet Malaysia.
In light of things, Fortinet advices 
network security professionals to 
adopt several key strategies, which 
includes a tighter network access 
for IoT devices, preparing for data 
breaches, 
segmenting 
networks 
to contain potentially disruptive 
IoT devices, and to use tools that 
scale dynamically, are provisioned 
easily, and that work together as a 
cooperative security fabric in order 
to share threat intelligence from 
across the company’s distributed 
environment 
and 
coordinate 
a 
response to a threat. 
further attract international companies 
to invest in the country. During his 
presentation, Tan Tze Meng, Head, 
Data Cloud, Digital Enablement, MDEC 
mentions that Malaysia’s data centre 
services market currently stands at 
less than RM1 billion (bn) but hopes 
for it to reach RM2 bn by 2020, based 
on a research done by Frost & Sullivan.
He also highlighted that there are 
eight key criteria’s that an organisation 
would need to consider when it comes 
to data centre and cloud investments, 
which includes connectivity, land, 
energy, ease of doing business, water 
(for cooling purposes), avoidance of 
risk, as well as financial/non-financial 
incentives and a data-friendly regime.
For Malaysia, Tan states that the 
biggest challenge are connectivity 
and high cost of bandwidth. 
However, this issue may be solved 
with the involvement of the Dark 
Fibre Model, which is slowly being 
practiced at Malaysia’s own data 
centre hub, Cyberjaya.
The Dark Fibre Model will reduce 
expenditure cost by buying the fibre 
that transmits information to other 
data centres, instead of ‘renting’ the 
connection. This will not only save 
cost, but will also make way for new 
data centres to be born, ultimately 
boosting the country’s attractiveness 
as a major data centre player on the 
global stage.

PC.com: Where did the idea of the Acer Swift 
7 come about? Not more than a few months 
earlier did HP launch its Spectre and ASUS 
with its Zenbook 3. Was the Swift 7 meant 
to level the playing field in terms of an ultra-
portable laptop while still meeting the ever-
increasing lightweight design and portability?
Seet: As a company, we are pursuing our effort to 
transform into a hardware, software and services 
company. Acer is constantly innovating and we 
have always been at the forefront and technology 
and development, being the first to market in 
several products that challenge the industry on 
what technology can achieve for customers. From 
the world’s first ultrabook, the Aspire S3 launched 
in 2011 to the recently-introduced Predator 21 
X, the world’s first curved screen notebook, Acer 
leads the way in design, productivity and power in 
devices.
We are focused on building innovative, premium 
products, and over the years, our product range 
has continuously become more stylish while 
retaining all its performance. This includes the 
ultra-portable, elegant Swift 7. What we offer is 
high-quality products with meaningful innovations 
and real value. The Swift 7 is the most innovative 
ultra-slim laptop we have ever developed with its 
outstanding portability, elegant design, and superb 
performance. It shows our investment, commitment 
as well as capability in research and development 
in producing the best products for our customers.
Acer is one of the early adopters of the 7th Gen 
Intel Core processors for our ultra-slim Swift series, 
again demonstrating that we are in the forefront 
of providing cutting-edge technology for our users. 
We believe that by designing products that meet 
the real needs of people, it proves and supports 
our ambition to deliver technology into the hands 
of many.
Besides being the world’s first laptop to be 
under 1cm thin, the Swift 7 is the also the perfect 
complement to any lifestyle with its sturdy build and 
excellent battery life of up to nine hours - ensuring 
that users gain more productivity from this laptop 
without having to lug the charger and cables around!
PC.com: Aside from the Swift 3 coming out 
with a brand new colour, can you tell us about 
the Swift 3 that makes it different from its 
predecessor?
Seet: The Acer Swift 3 was introduced in 
October last year in its Sparkly Silver colour whilst 
the new colour unveiled in November was the 
Luxury Gold. The elegant Luxury Gold colour adds 
a touch of luxe to this irresistible laptop which 
is ideal for modern working professionals and 
students who seek a stylish productivity device to 
complement their personality.
Powered by 7th Gen Intel Core i5 processor, 
the Swift 3 features Acer Fingerprint Reader that 
is paired with Windows Hello to offer an efficient, 
convenient and secure way to access user’s 
Windows account. Also, it comes with 2x2 MU-
MIMO 802.11ac technology and fast 256GB SSD, 
the Swift 3 offers 4GB of memory and up to 10 
hours of battery life, delivering solid results in a 
small package. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. 
We believe both colours will have their own groups 
of fans.
PC.com: The whole idea of 360-degree hinges 
have been around for quite some time like the 
Lenovo Yoga 900S and the HP Spectre x360 
for example. What makes the Acer Spin 5 
different from the rest? 
Seet: The 360-degree hinge is not a new technology 
to Acer, as we already have the convertible Aspire 
R14 which was launched early last year. The Aspire 
R14 can be transformed into four different modes 
for a variety of needs, making it easier and more 
convenient to use and perform at work or play.
No doubt, the hinge technology has become 
more advanced over time. The whole idea is about 
the usability of the device. The Spin 5 features 
Acer’s patented 360-degree dual-torque hinge, 
providing wobble-free touch experience and high 
level of convenience via its easy convertibility to 
the four useful modes; as a laptop or tablet, in a 
space-saving display mode, or in tent mode with 
great viewing angles for sharing presentations or 
watching movies. The flexible and sturdy hinge also 
makes it easy to open but prevents toppling over 
when using the 13.3-inch Full HD IPS touchscreen 
display. The convertible Spin 5 is offering ultimate 
flexibility to allow users to use it per their 
requirements, while maximizing productivity.
Apart from the hinge technology, the Spin 5 is 
powered by 7th Gen Intel ® Core™ i3, 4GB DDR4 
memory and up to 128GB of SSD storage for best-in- 
class performance and fast computing experience. 
Furthermore, no charging is needed when you are 
out all-day for work or play with up to 10 hours of 
battery life.
PC.com: The Acer Predator Z35 monitor is 
relatively larger (35-inches total) compared 
to the 27-inch for the Z1. What would you say 
differentiates the Z1 from the Z35?
Seet: Predator Z1 is the first 27-inch, curved monitor 
with NVIDIA ® G-SYNC ™ technology. What makes 
this monitor even more interesting is its Tobii eye-
tracking technology, which allows new interactions 
like aiming, identifying enemies and taking cover 
simply by looking at objects on the screen. With 
this cutting-edge technology, gamers will be able 
to interact with the characters more realistically 
and enjoy a much more immersive and seamless 
gaming experience. Their eyes and intuition will be 
their greatest weapon now.
On the other hand, the Predator Z35 is a 35-inch 
21:9 UltraWide Full HD (2560x1080) curved gaming 
monitor with a curvature of 2000R featuring NVIDIA 
G-SYNC for immersive, dynamic and wrap-around 
gaming experience. It supports overclocking to a 
lightning-fast mode of up to 200Hz refresh rate. 
Size does matter. It depends on the users on what 
do they want to use their laptop for. At the end, 
everything goes down to the reason they acquire 
the devices.
PC.com: In terms of the AIO Acer C Aspire 22, 
will there be any significant upgrades brought 
to it in the near future?
Seet: Not at the moment.
PC.com: Is there anything we can expect from 
Acer in 2017?
Seet: At this point, I can only say: please wait 
for our announcement. One thing for sure is that 
Acer will always be moving forward to offer our 
innovative products which will never fail to excite 
the users.

eCommerce: The Road to

Criteo and published by Ovum, found 
that technology, new business models 
and evolving consumer behaviour are 
the key drivers of disruption in retail.

The Future of eCommerce:
Retailers Must Evolve Now or 
Eventually Fall by the Wayside

of smartphone users is set to raise the 
demand for online shopping platforms 
and experiences in the months ahead.
Online shopping today is largely 
driven by price and convenience 
– a good deal on products that 
are delivered quickly. By 2026, 
these 
fundamental 
desires 
will 
still exist, but expectations of the 
shopping experience would have 
changed 
drastically. 
Millennials 
and Generation Z consumers, for 
example, will be demanding more 
from eCommerce providers, such as 
the ability to discover in real-time 
unique goods they will not find in big-
box retail chains.
Undeniably, with the rise of 
eCommerce – in Malaysia and globally, 
the retail sector is becoming more 
competitive. For online and offline 
retail businesses to stay relevant 10 
years from now and beyond, here are 
two key developments that must be 
considered:
The Term ‘Online Pure-Play’ Will Be 
Eradicated By 2026
For many customers, one initial trial 
is both required and sufficient to build 
the trust necessary to make future 
purchases without having to physically 
see and feel each new product. As 
such, while new entrants to retail will 
no doubt start from an online pure-
play perspective, they will inevitably 
move to test out physical retail 
space with pop-ups, complemented 
by collections or showcase stores to 
facilitate product discovery and trial. 
ZALORA is a prominent example of 
an eCommerce brand in Asia that has 
already done this. 
Once they turn into established 
brands with a significant consumer 
following, pure-play online retailers 
must further develop their physical 
presence, to enhance fulfilment and 
customer service. For most, this will 
take the form of partnerships along 
the lines that are emerging today, 
such as the ‘click-and-collect’ model. 
Retailers in Malaysia can perhaps 
draw inspiration from the UK – 
where brands like ASOS and Boots, 
and eBay and Argos, have started 
collaborating and implementing click-
and-collect models. Another example 
is MatahariMall.com in indonesia, 
which has combined its online

presence with designated counters 
within its existing physical malls 
and hyper-marts to enable click-
and-collect.
By 2026, physical retailers will 
continue to reduce the amount of 
physical space they hold, switching 
their investment emphases online. 
Online retailers, on the other hand, 
will invest further in establishing 
physical presences. As such, the term 
‘pure-play’ will be rendered obsolete.
Becoming Mobile-First is Key to 
Creating Shopping Experiences of 
the Future
in the retail and commerce domain, 
mobile will soon become the dominant 
channel for loyalty programmes and 
rewards, due to its ability to provide 
levels of interactivity and engagement 
that traditional programmes cannot 
match. in technologically advanced 
markets like Hong Kong, Singapore 
and Taiwan, mobile advertising is 
already firmly in the advertising 
mix and will become the dominant 
(but not exclusive) channel for most 
brands by 2026. 
with more than 44 billion mobile 
users, digital advertising and content 
is emerging as a key customer 
engagement channel for retailers 
in Malaysia. in 2016, Malaysian 
businesses invested a total of RM 
1.37 billion in digital advertising. As 
businesses start to derive more value 
and even more consumers come 
online, annual investment in digital 
engagement is expected to exceed 
RM 2 billion by 2020. 
As a natural extension of mobile 
becoming mainstream, ‘contextual 
location’ will become an integral 
part of the retail experience. The 
ability to identify a user’s location and 
deliver targeted, timely and relevant 
information and messages to his or 
her mobile device is a powerful and 
compelling proposition. Moreover, the 
real-time aspect of location analytics 
will offer a more adaptive approach 
to marketing, enabling retailers in 
Malaysia to adapt their engagement 
tactics in real-time to meet an 
individual consumer’s needs. 
One example is the use of 
Bluetooth Low energy (BLe) beacons. 
BLe beacons are tiny units with 
built-in sensors that can broadcast 
signals to BLe-enabled and mobile 
devices within range, triggering 
corresponding beacon applications 
on the device and allowing retailers 
to engage their customers after they 
have left their physical stores. 
in this instance, if an individual 
in Kuala Lumpur’s Low Yat Plaza 
has stood in an aisle looking at 
smart Tvs for more than 15 minutes 
but leaves a store within the mall 
without buying one, location-based 
technology will suggest that interest 
is there even though it has not led 
to a purchase. A retailer in the mall 
who has implemented this technology 
can then follow up by sending 
personalised recommendations and 
promotions related to the product to 
the customer’s smartphone. These 
serve as reminders and incentives for 
the customer to purchase from that 
retailer, rather than its competitors.
Today, most mobile advertising 
happens on the mobile web 
because it is convenient and 
scalable. However, with consumers 
increasingly engaging with digital 
content and services anytime and 
anywhere on mobile devices via 
native applications, retailers must 
become familiar with application-
based and cross-device advertising 
and messaging. Retailers who can

fter almost a year after Gravity Rush came 
onto the big stage, Gravity Rush 2 is here and 
it’s bigger and better than the last. Admittedly, 
I am going into Gravity Rush 2 blind as I never got a 
chance to experience how great the first instalment 
was (I don’t get paid enough to buy all the games I 
want to continue with the storyline). However, due 
to the overwhelming reception Gravity Rush received 
at the beginning of last year, I had a certain level of 
expectations with Gravity Rush 2.

Believe I Can Fly
Well, you’re not technically flying but if you’re 
able to bend the laws of physics and gravity 
– pun intended – into your favour, you will 
be able to. Although I don’t advise you trying it in 
real life, you’re more than welcome to test out the 
gravity-controlling mechanics, which is great and 
super easy to get accustomed to, making me feel 
like an air bender on steroids (minus the ability 
to control the air around you). You will be able to 
choose between three different gravity-defying 
styles that will revolve around your playstyle.
Aside from the original gravity style featured 
in the first game, Gravity Rush 2 includes two new 
styles to further diversify one’s playstyle. Lunar 
allows you to be lighter while increasing your speed 
and ability to jump higher. Jupiter on the other hand, 
makes you heavier but gives your attack moves 
greater damage output and impact. What makes 
Gravity Rush 2 great is the ability to switch styles 
with the touch pad, making it that much easier to 
be switch up the gravity styles when you choose.
Seeing as I was a complete noob – and proud 
– when it comes to Gravity Rush 2, there is a bit of 
a learning curve when it comes to getting around 
using the winds and gravity to your favour. A piece 
of advice I can give to new players for Gravity Rush 
2 is to spend a couple of minutes to wander around 
the aerial city of Hekseville by just jumping – 
literally – at any opportunity to familiarise yourself 
with the controls.
A Whole New World
After going through hours of gameplay walkthrough 
footage for Gravity Rush and diving straight into 
Gravity Rush 2, it’s very easy to tell the difference 
between the two. First off, Gravity Rush 2 has a 
much larger open-world to explore as compared to 
its predecessor. Although the game does pick up 
where Gravity Rush ended, the art direction and 
style was improved tremendously, making the first 
instalment look cheap and boring. What I enjoyed 
most about the graphics was its comical, yet 
somewhat heavily focused on the vibrant colours of 
the environment, looking a lot like what Borderlands 
would do. However, for someone who isn’t used to 
being surrounded by vibrant and vivid colours, it 
could get a bit uncomfortable after a while as the 
camera controls in Gravity Rush 2 is mediocre at 
best. The best way to counter this is to constantly 
have your thumb over the right analog stick so you 
can click it to recentre the camera in case you get a 
bit too discombobulated.
A great thing about open-world concepts in 
RPGs is the ability to explore to your heart’s content 
without having to continue the storyline until you 
see fit; one of the many reasons why I adore RPGs 
the most, I can do whatever I want and whenever 
I want to do it. Another reason is because I do not 
possess the same amount of free time as I once did

GREAT
where I know look back and think, ‘what in the hell 
was I thinking?!’ I digress, back to Gravity Rush 2.
From floating cities to airships, the world – 
also known as Jirga Para Lhao – is your oyster 
to explore. Be sure to make the most out of your 
exploration time as you will undoubtedly come 
across upgradable gems. What I would encourage 
you to do is jump over the edge in first-person mode 
as it was the closest I could get to skydiving without 
having to leave my own home (for all lazy adrenaline 
junkies, this one’s for you).
Recovering the Continuities
I am not a huge fan of anime so asking me to watch 
the anime to fully understand the background of the 
story sounds like lazy craftsmanship. What could 
have been included into the game was left out and 
made into a show so the publishers could milk out 
every cent from poor plebs like me (admittedly, I 
was a bit too invested into the Kingsglaive movie as 
well as the animated series, Brotherhood).
Gravity Rush: the Animation – Overture is a 
17-minute short that helps confused gamers to tie 
the original PS Vita game along with the sequel into 
one convoluted storyline. If you happen to be the 
sort of person who has to get the story straight from 
the get-go, I recommend you give the two-episode 
short a watch as it does pretty well in tying the story 
together.
Worse Than Klingon
I’ll probably piss off some Trekkies reading this 
but I’ve always wanted to tango with the Devil 
anyway. The story of Gravity Rush 2 is told through 
a fictional language so it’s best to be prepared for 
plenty subtitle reading. The language in its own is 
highly intolerable to my ears; and here I thought 
Klingon was bad enough. What happened to the 
good ol’ days where fictional languages have a nice, 
velvety sound to it, like Elvish? Most of the entire 
narrative is told through in-game conversations so 
be sure you’re on your toes to read the subtitles. If 
not, you could miss out on a key piece of information 
to further the storyline.
Aside from the main storyline, Gravity Rush 2 
does provide some pretty interesting side quests, 
albeit somewhat similar to what Final Fantasy XV 
had to offer (fetch your own damn jewels Dino 
you smug looking son of a B!). The side quests in 
Gravity Rush 2 vary between borderline interesting 
and fun to just being absurdly weird like staging an 
alcoholic’s intervention.
At The End Of It All
When it comes right down to it, aside from 
its glaringly annoying narrative and constant 
subtitle-reading, Gravity Rush 2 is a pretty 
interesting game with a far greater gameplay 
than it gives itself credit for. If you’re one for 
RPGs, this is the game for you without any 
restrictions whatsoever when it comes to 
exploring the open-world.

have always been a fan of anything horror; whether it’s movies, TV series or even video games. Give me a good 
horror story and it will sell itself. Unfortunately, thanks to Hollywood, most horror movies and video games these 
days have been exceptionally disappointing. Although it does have great jump scares, the story alone is two-
dimensional, making it boring after the first 20 minutes.

GOOD
Sara Is Missing (SIM) provides a refreshing 
take on the horror genre in video games through 
an simulation game setting where everything is 
being played through the eyes of another device. 
Basically, your phone has become Sara’s phone 
the moment you launch the game, which is a great 
take on the modern-day horrors of how connected 
we are to our phones.
Not Your Everyday Horror
SIM is not your typical horror video game with 
jump scares or anything remotely horrifying. On 
the contrary, the game talks about the horrors of 
mobile technology and how it can easily dictate 
our lives and with every decision we make. I 
applaud Monsoon Labs for the way it handled 
modern-day voyeurism through the content you 
can find in the phone. I would also like to point 
out a throw-away character in the game who goes 
by ‘Buddy’. Why Sara would choose to be friends 
with a sleaze like that is beyond me (although I 
could see myself using his pickup lines in the near 
future when my love life goes up in flames).
The game starts you off with Iris, the 
phone’s very own personal AI assistant (which 
is essentially Siri spelled backwards). Iris is a 
compelling character as it will be your only option 
for advice and help as you go about the game. 
What makes Iris creepy is its Jarvis-like style of 
talking, very much like a human.
Iris will tell you that Sara is missing – yeah, 
no shit Sherlock – and it is your job to find her; 
you literally have no say in the matter and that is 
where the fun starts. After a brief conversation 
with Iris, I gained access to Sara’s home page 
where you can creep on her personal messages, 
emails and notes. Her gallery, unfortunately, 
would be corrupted until you discover the right 
clues to Iris (and here I was thinking Monsoon 
Labs would’ve gone the full nine yards with nude 
selfies or whatnot). After scrolling her messages, I 
only have two questions for the developers – who 
are the actresses who play Faith and Aya and how 
do I get to know them?
I kid of course.
The Horrors Within
Throughout the course of the game, you would have 
to skim through every single message log Sara has 
with her friends, her mother and even her asshole 
ex-boyfriend (who sounds like he has the best damn 
job in the world photographing nude models). Once 
you discover a clue, simply tap and hold on the 
screen and if it’s the right clue, Iris will appear to 
help you progress with the game.
As mentioned earlier about the idea of voyeurism, 
SIM focuses on a lot of sexual topics in the game, 
mainly one of which is a clue that James will send 
you in the later portion of the game. The clue in 
question talks about a satanic calendar who have 
a thing for orgies, anal sex and human sacrifice 
(because all go very well together don’t they).
One of the things I didn’t like about the game 
was its highly anti-climactic ending, which makes 
you choose between two characters with a short 
time limit. However, there was a subtle nod to 
there being more to the game in a later episode so 
perhaps there will be more to the story in the future.
A Lovable Brain Teaser
I love a good puzzle game and in that aspect, 
Monsoon Labs have captured it perfectly with just a 
hint of horror added with a splash of insanity. More 
so, Buddy is hilarious and I do hope he comes back 
in the later episodes with more ridiculous ways of 
trying to send girls dick pics or even putting worn 
out and sleazy pickup lines to work. 
Are you f#$%ing kidding me Buddy
How are you still friends with him, Sara

Keeping It Classy
Keeping in touch with the classic 
Super Mario Bros. running game, 
Super Mario Run is a side-
scrolling, 
auto-running 
mobile 
game, much like its predecessor. 
You keep control of Mario as you 
run from left to right while hopping 
over obstacles and trying to collect 
gold coins. Super Mario Run comes 
with another game mode called 
‘Toad Rally’ where you will race 
against the ghost of other players 
to beat their time, like how the 
Super Mario Kart series worked.
The other game mode is 
called 
‘Mushroom 
Kingdom’ 
where you can customise your 
very own kingdom with the coins 
you collected through the main 
gameplay. The more coins you 
collect, the more customisation 
you can do to the castle.
Pay To Play
Although Super Mario Run does come 
free-to-play, if you want access to the 
entire game, it does come with a one-
time payment of $USD9.99. Considering 
the depreciating value of our local 
currency compared to US Dollars, it 
would be safe to say that not everyone 
would be willing to pay to play a mobile 
game that is priced at RM39.90 (well, I 
was hesitant on it; I can do much more 
with that sort of money).

Nostalgia
For fans who grew up with the 
franchise, Super Mario Run is a 
great throwback to the series. 
Much like how I was with Final 
Fantasy XV (I’m a huge geek 
towards the series, sue me), Super 
Mario run is definitely worth its 
weight in gold just to get the sense 
of nostalgia.

The first day of the tournament 
already saw an upset for the local 
favourites as they lost their respective 
matches and dropped down to the 
lower bracket while eventual grand 
finalists DC and Newbee were off to a 
strong start in their opening matches. 
DC in particular had a tougher road 
compared to their opponents as they 
had a TI6 grand final replay against 
Wings Gaming. History did not end up 
repeating itself as DC walked away, 
winning two games in a best-of-three 
series. In the end, Newbee from 
Group and DC from Group B made its 
way to the semifinals.
Day 2 wasn’t any better as it 
saw the elimination of the local 
favourites as well as crowd favourite 
Team NP (vastly due to its captain, 
EnternalEnvy) and XctN. This was 
largely due to their losses against 
VP and Wings Gaming, which saw 
them make up the other half of the 
semifinal bracket. The final day of ESL 
One Genting saw nail biting matches 
between DC and VP as well as an all-
Chinese semifinal, Newbee vs Wings 
Gaming. Although DC did comfortably 
win the series 2 – 0, Newbee took 
down Wings Gaming 2 – 1, ensuring 
there wouldn’t be a repeat of the TI6 
grand final.
The grand final was a back-and-
forth best-of-five series, which saw 
Wings Gaming take the lead after 
a confident and comfortable win 
against DC. Unfazed, DC came into 
the second game with guns blazing 
and after almost an hour in game 
time, managed to level the scoring 
to 1 – 1. Game three saw Newbee 
pulling ahead once again after some 
beautiful teamwork and exceptional 
individual gameplay from the boys 
from China. Similar to game three, 
game four saw another game ending 
just before the half hour mark but this 
time in DC’s favour as they went for a 
similar hero composition that worked 
out for them against VP in day two. 
This shattered Newbee’s confidence 
as DC went on to steamroll the 
Chinese powerhouse in game five, 
forcing out the ‘GG’ call from Newbee 
just after the half hour mark.

ultra-wide viewing angle, matching the 
natural curvature of the human eye. It 
can also express brilliant and accurate 
colours across a 125% sRGB spectrum 
while being able to produce a 3,000:1 
contrast ratio. This amplifies previously-
hidden gaming details in both light and 
dark settings. The CFG70 also leverages 
integrated AMD FreeSync Technology 
K
over HDMI functionality to synchronise 
with the screen’s impressively high 
144Hz refresh rate with users’ AMD 
graphics cards.
From 27 January onwards, the 
Samsung CFG70 gaming monitor will 
be available for offline purchase at 
selected retail outlets at RM1,699 (24-

Nintendo Switch also offers local 
multiplayer services where you can 
connect up to 8 devices in a local LAN 
setting and game away. There will 
also be a free trial period for its online 
services until the Fall of 2017. The 
great thing about the Nintendo Switch 
is the implementation of no region 
locking, so you can purchase a game 
from Japan or America and be able to 
play it in Malaysia.
With up to 6 hours of battery life 
on a single charge, the Nintendo 
Switch also allows you to play while 
still charging through the USB Type-C 
charging port so you won’t have to 
waste time waiting. The Joy Con 
controllers also offer two exciting 
colours in Neon Blue and Neon Red. The 
Joy Con controllers also come sensing 
and vibration technology known as HD 
Rumble, giving even more realism and 
interaction with the games.

Honda’s “Riding Assist” tech borrows from Asimo to 
balance it self
he next time you go on a ride, your motorbike may just 
stand on its own – it can even follow you like a puppy 
back to your house!
Honda has announced during CES a new kind of motorcycle - 
a self-stabilizing motorcycle that at this point still has no name 
attached to it. Unlike the Segway and BMW’s Motorrad Vision 
concept motorcycle (which we covered in the November issue), 
Honda’s “Riding Assist” tech doesn’t rely on heavy gyroscopes 
to balance itself. It instead uses tech derived from the balancing 
systems in its Asimo robot and Uni-Cub electric mobility scooter, 
developed at its Silicon Valley R&D center.
Instead it uses a drive-by-wire system that works at speeds 
below 5 km/h that passes the control of the front wheel to the 
computer. The bike senses lean angles and swings the wheel to 
either side, thousands of times per second, to counteract any 
tendency tip over.
The computer also has a follow-me-home mode that can 
propel the bike to follow the rider when it needs to..
