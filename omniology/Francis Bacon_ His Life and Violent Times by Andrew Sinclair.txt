Prologue
Because he did not go to Moscow, Francis Bacon was able to see
me. He came into The Groucho on the balls of his feet with the
spring and the bounce in his step of a young man. He was nearly
eighty years
old, but his round face with taut skin and imperious
green gaze was that of a young commander. After the inquisition of
his eyes, the gestures illustrated the artist. The hands were those of
a worker, square with strong fingers, but he used them to demon-
strate the points of his piercing intelligence as if he were a French
logician. His clothes were casual and elegant and practical; he might
have been
a yachtsman come
to
port
in Soho. Hypnotic
as
the
Ancient Mariner, he told me something of his life.
We
spent
four hours
together and consumed
four
botties
of
champagne. Although
I managed to pay for one, the rest were his
gift to our interview. He settled the bill with fifty pound notes taken
from a
roll
in
his pocket. He was prodigal
in
his generosity and
impatient of his time. Trying and failing to connect at the beginning,
he consulted his watch every few minutes, as though he had to leap
up and go. But as he grew interested in the war culture of the 1940s,
the
subject
of my
book,
and
in
the
Greek
dramatists
and
in
reminiscences of Soho and Limehouse, where
I had also lived, he
forgot
the
passing
hours
and
spoke
with
amazing
fluency
and
frankness, with only a slight lisp or momentary stutter making him
pause upon
a
syllable - which, on one
occasion,
caused me
to
misquote his quotation from Aeschylus about blood smiling rather
than blood spilling.
For he allowed me to take notes as he spoke, a rarity with him and
a sign of trust. He had appreciated some of my books and knew of

Francis Bacon
me as a neighbour at times, and a social historian. His easy manner
and deprecating charm did not hide an
incisive wit and adamant
philosophy. He had reached the ultimate stage in life when he knew
what he was
doing and
described
precisely why he
did
it.
His
'ordered chaos' and
'rules of chance'
in the sensation of painting
reminded me strongly of Baudelaire and Verlaine and Rimbaud,
all
ofwhom he admired, with their 'fixing of vertigos' and 'the reasoned
unreason of the senses'. As he talked of Michelangelo and Ingres,
and of trying
to
recreate
the voluptuous
feeling of male
flesh,
I
remembered Baudelaire's call for Uuxe^ calme et voluptf. Bacon told
me that he had achieved that, in his last love, in his optimism about
nothing and in exhilarated despair - practised phrases that he had
used with other people. He
really seemed not only the supreme
master of the use of paint of his age, but also the captain at last of
his long yawing about the futility of life. If his answer to dying was
hard work and hedonism,
he was
holding
the Grim Reaper
in
perpetual check.
He changed my life as he had those of many other people.
It was
not so much his pictures, although they captured in his snare of the
moment both the history of his time and his autobiography, which
could
translate
in
images
his
personal
feelings
into
the
private
survivals of countless millions of his viewers. Those transcendent
Baconian figures of the twentieth century meant less to me than this
dominant
little man, whose
courage
in
his
honest and
reckless
pursuit of the
life of the artiste damne^ and his fierce dedication to
the fact of his work, reminded me of the clarion call of my young
days,
the men
sitting round
a
table
in
The Plague by Camus,
discussing what a metier was. The metier was the only reason to live
when the plague came. Yet Bacon went further than The Plague. He
reminded me of what Camus had written about Meursault, the hero
of The Outsider, 'For me, Meursault is not a reject, but a poor and
naked man,
in
love with
a sun
that
casts no shadows. Far from
lacking
all
sensibility, he
is
driven by
a tenacious and
therefore
profound passion, the passion for an absolute and for truth. This
truth
is as yet a negative one, a truth bom of living and feeling, but
without which no triumph over the self or over the world will ever
be possible.'

Prologue
To me,
as
to everyone
else
in his
later
life, Bacon denied that
there was any message
in his pictures. He painted by instinct, by
feeling, by hazard. What appeared was not a conscious work of art.
Bacon did not lie, he was openness itself. But he chose to deny the
directive of the unconscious, the sorting-house of the mind in the
selection of the remembered image, the imperative of the sifting of
time past at the moment that his hand moved the brush. When
I
pointed
out
to Bacon
that some
critics had
even
called him
a
mannerist within
the
formal European
tradition, he laughed and
said, with the self-mockery of the Anglo-Irish gendeman he was,
Well, they would say that of me, wouldn't they.^ The English, theyVe
always hated my pictures over here.'
I have never spent a more
illuminating four hours
in my
life.
Although
I met Bacon on many other occasions,
this was the only
time we talked
at length and in depth. We corresponded, and he
liked the historian and classicist in me. Although he did not want his
biography written for reasons that will be explained, we were both
concerned
in
depicting
the
history of our
times. That was
our
common ground. Just before his death I had written to him, enclosing
a copy of my translations from The Greek Anthology and asking to
meet him again as
I was writing the account of his
life and times.
Tragically, there was no response. He died in Madrid.
It is a failure of writers that they cannot paint. A close friend and
rival of Bacon's for the affections of the AustraHan painter Roy de
Maistre, the novelist Patrick White, described how he always wanted
to be an artist and not have to
sit in front of a grey blank piece of
paper every morning. Action was
all, the smearing of the paint on
the canvas, as Bacon triumphantly demonstrated.
I also had tried to
be an
artist. In fact at school, another enthusiast for Bacon, Lord
Gowrie, had bought one of my early paintings and declared that
I
should have been a painter, not a writer.
I should probably have been
neither, but
it
is
too
late now.
I have my
metier^
as Bacon most
certainly had his. My unique job
is to try and describe the history
and violent Hfe of this genius, the supreme painter of the century.


An Awareness of War
A man that is young in years may be old in hours, if he have
lost no time. But that happeneth rarely. Generally, youth is
like the first cogitations, not so wise as the second. For there
is a youth in thoughts as well as in ages. And yet the
invention of young men is more lively than that of the old;
and imaginations stream into their minds better, and as
it
were more divinely. Natures that have much heat, and great
and violent desires and perturbations, are not ripe for action
till they have passed the meridian of their years.
'OfYouthandAge'
by Francis Bacon, Lord Verulam,
Viscount St. Albans
*The mind
is
like a
sieve,' the painter, Francis Bacon, once
said.
That sieve he used to strain from his memory the grit and spUnters
of a violent age. The structure of the human brain makes us record
each and every image that we see. Yet our recollection
is the mesh
on which those million on million pictures of the past are sifted for
the benefit of the conscious present. Our intelligence chooses one
image among a multitude to describe or to depict. 'We saw that,' we
say. Or we draw
it,
if we have the
gift. Francis Bacon selected and
set down the fear and the aggression of his century, so much out of
kelter and true.
The
first memory that he
relished was of painting as war and
deceit. He came
to
live
in London
at the age of
five, where he
remembered
his
father
telling him
that the
First World War had
begun. His father had a job in the War Office. They lived near Hyde
Park at Westbourne Terrace, and Francis Bacon remembered that

Francis Bacon
military men would spray the ground with something phosphorescent
out of watering-cans, so that the grass glittered in zig-zags on the
rough blades. When a black-out was enforced, this device was meant
to persuade the German Zeppelins and Gothas into thinking that
the luminous Park was a residential area which had
left
its
lights
on. Then the bombs would rain down on the innocent worms. This
camouflage
did
not work,
although
its memory was
to
recur
in
Bacon's later use of rough canvas and paint.
A
still earlier memory was of a British cavalry regiment galloping
up the drive of his father's training establishment near the Curragh
just before the outbreak of the
First World War. The horsemen
were on manoeuvres, waiting to mobilize for that conflict in Europe
or to intervene in Ulster, which was already preparing for a civil war
in Ireland. Bacon's father, Anthony Edward Mortimer Bacon, had
started
his
army
career
not
as
a
mounted
soldier,
but
as
an
infantryman. He had been born in Adelaide in South Australia in
1870, the son of Alice Lawrence of that city and Captain Edward
Bacon of Eyewood in Herefordshire, whose father had been urged
by Queen Victoria to take up the lapsed tide of Lord Oxford. The
tide came, by
direct
descent, from
the
original philosopher and
statesman Francis Bacon, Lord Verulam - only he could not afford
it. Anthony Bacon had been educated
at the semi-military public
school of Wellington and had joined the Durham Light Infantry. He
rose
to
the rank of lieutenant and accompanied
his regiment
to
Buttevant
in County Cork, where he had
his
first
taste
of Irish
hunting with the Duhallow Hounds. Later, the regiment was posted
to Dublin, where Anthony Bacon became a close friend of Captain
James Barry, the ADC to Earl Cadogan, then Lord Lieutenant of
Ireland, and the ^on of the Lord Justice of Appeal who styled himself
the O'Barrymore of the Galtees. The Barrys were 'Castle Catholics',
content to co-operate with members of the Protestant Ascendancy
such as Anthony Bacon, who took up Barry's passion for horses and
hunting.
The Boer War, however, proved the climacteric time in the life of
Francis Bacon's father. Now gazetted a captain, he was shipped with
his battaHon to South Africa in 1902 to avenge the defeats at Colenso
and Spion Kop. Ladysmith was
still under siege, and more bloody

An Awareness of War
fighting was necessary to break the Boer defences on the way there.
General Redvers BuUer launched the Durham Light Infantry on a
frontal attack on the ridge at Vaal Krantz that proved as desperate a
charge for the regiment as
its assault at Inkerman in the Crimean
War. The soldiers had to attack over a pontoon bridge that crossed
the Tugela River.
*It was rather a stiff job/ the commander of the
Light Brigade wrote
in understatement,
'and
the Durham Light
Infantry at first were a bit staggered at the heavy fire which greeted
them. But they pulled themselves together, and covered by accurate
shelling and closely supported by the Rifle Brigade, they breasted
the
hill splendidly.' The infantry had to spend the night in shallow
trenches
or
schanzes, bombarded by pom-poms and
fusillades
of
Mauser
rifle
fire. The next day, they beat off the Boer counter-
attacks
through
burning
grass,
until
they were
withdrawn
that
evening. The
action had been
useless,
although General BuUer
thought the
retreat was done 'uncommonly well'. Twenty officers
and men were killed, seventy-six wounded, while Captain Bacon was
unhurt. He would speak of his service under fire to his sons.
In the following assault on Terrace Hill,
it was the turn of Hart's
Irish Brigade to be shattered. It took five hundred casualties, but the
advance was held
'by the eyeUds' by the Durham Light Infantry,
digging into the forward positions. The regiment played little further
part in the actual Relief of Ladysmith and was then relegated
to
serve as the guardian of the railway lines from Natal to Transvaal,
where the British armies were bent on the capture of the Boer capital
at Pretoria. But when the Boer commanders refused to surrender
with the British annexation of their Republic, Captain Bacon found
himself transposed
to the
role of a mounted
soldier, on trek
for
month after month, living in the saddle, sleeping on the veldt under
a blanket and the stars, pursuing the elusive guerillas. Many of the
Durham Light Infantry had been miners and had learned to ride on
pit ponies. And so they could ride with their Captain, already used
to stirrup and reins from his Irish hunting experience. To him, the
horse became war and the pursuit of life.
At the end of the
conflict. Captain Bacon found himself in the
Fourth Militia Battalion of his regiment on training duties back at
the
depot
in
Newcastle -on-Tyne.
There
he
met
and
married

Francis Bacon
Winifred Christina Loxley Firth. He was thirty-four years old, while
she was only twenty, an heiress to a steel business and a Northum-
berland
coUiery,
for
her
Scottish
and
French grandmother had
married a mine-owner called Watson. The family looks came from
the grandmother, who was strikingly beautiful with black hair and
blue eyes and high cheekbones. She was also astute and insisted that
all her children became directors of the Watson coal mines. Some of
these royalties would even pass down to the grandchildren, who were
partially to live on the black gold of the underground.
From
her
mother,
Winifred
Christina would
also
inherit
an
interest in the knives, forks and spoons made by the Firth company
in
Sheffield. Now only the fagade of the business
stands with
a
wasteland of industry behind its grinning open windows and doorless
exterior. Yet in its thriving time,
it was luxuriant with one
ill legacy.
The soot and grime of Sheffield were held to give the Firth children
'a weak chest': recent discoveries of radon, a radioactive gas within
the
geology
of Derbyshire,
revealed what
affected
the
lungs
of
generations of householders
in the
city.
Certainly
the boys were
afflicted, although the girls did not appear to suffer so much from
bronchial problems. One of Winifred
Christina's sons would
die
young from
his bad
lungs, while
another,
Francis Bacon, would
suffer from debilitating and desperate asthma all his born days.
Winifred Christina was connected to more fortune. She was the
niece of Highat Mitchell, the wife of Charles William Mitchell of
Jesmond Towers, a house which Francis Bacon was to remember as
not much smaller than the Palace of Westminster at the end of the
tram tracks, out of the city. Her dowry and inheritance were put in
trust and would keep the Bacon family together. It could hardly have
existed on the pay of a junior army officer. Her mother, Winifred
Margaret Firth, was also wealthy and, in 1899, had remarried a rich
young man of twenty-two, Walter Loraine Bell, who was also devoted
to horses and hunting and carried the horn in Devonshire.
Anthony Bacon now left the army, taking on the eventual position
of Honorary Major with permission to retain and wear the prescribed
uniform of scarlet with dark green
facings and bugle badge. He
settled in a rented property called Canney Court near Brannocks-
town village in County Kildare. Situated near the army barracks at

An Awareness of War
the Curragh,
it was a racing and horse-breeding estabHshment for
the British cavalry, a plain square house with extensive stables and
quarters
for the grooms. Bacon now registered his racing colours
and was to win occasionally at the Punchestown Races with his wife's
brother, 'Ginger' Leslie Loxley Firth, in the saddle. His
first son,
Harley Bacon, was born in a nursing home in Dublin in 1905. And
Anthony Bacon's friend, James Barry, persuaded his wife's mother,
Winifred Bell, and her rich young husband to move into the family
country house, Lismany near Ballinasloe, where Walter Loraine Bell
became Master of the East Galway Hounds. Barry could now ride
with his friend Bacon and his mother-in-law to the meets with the
Earl
of Clancarty,
then under
the
protection
of the
bankruptcy
courts, and his Countess, who had been Belle Bilton of the Empire
Theatre. Lismany was a two-storey great house with an irregular
fagade of gables and Tudor-Revival and Georgian windows with
rusticated surrounds and three-sided bow
fronts. The
estate was
large, some twenty-nine thousand acres, and Mrs Bell was famous
for the children's parties she gave for Harley and his friends.
In
1908, Walter Loraine
Bell became
the Joint Master of the
Duhallow Hunt which Anthony Bacon had
followed on
his
first
posting
to
Ireland. The
Bells moved
to
a
rented
house
called
Belleview near Mallow in County Cork. A year later on the 28th of
October, Winifred Christina Bacon bore her second son, Francis,
during the week of the Dublin Horse Show in a nursing home at 63
Lower Baggot Street, in the capital.
'It
is as natural to die as to be
born,' his distant ancestor Francis Bacon, Lord Verulam, had written
in his EssaySy 'and to a little infant, perhaps, the one
is as painful as
the other.' The place of the infant's birth was, indeed, a route to
stealthy murder, which he
later heard told as a child. In 1920 on
Bloody Sunday in November, during the time of the troubles before
the independence
of Ireland,
Sinn Fein gunmen
killed
fourteen
British undercover officers
in Dublin in their lodgings or in their
beds or at their breakfast. At 92 Lower Baggot Street, a dozen armed
men pistolled Captain Newbury, a Court Martial Officer, as he was
climbing out of the bedroom window. His body lay half in and half
out of the room in front of his pregnant wife, who later gave birth to
a still-born child. At 119, another Court Martial Officer, who had

10
Francis Bacon
been
a
prosecutor
under
the
Restoration
of Order
in
Ireland
Regulations, Captain Baggally, was also shot at dawn. He had lost a
leg in the First World War, and his disability became his death in
the street of the English painter's first breath.
The baby boy was taken to his father's horse training establish-
ment at Canney Court in the parish of Giltown in County Kildare,
and he was baptised in the nearby St. Patrick's Church in Canalway,
where his uncle 'Ginger' had the Lodge. Before the child was two
years old, his father filled in the Census return for the household.
He
detailed the many people needed
to run the
great houses of
Ireland
in
the
days when
horses were
still
the main means
of
transport, recreation and war. As the house and the grooms' quarters
were joined under one roof, the full complement was listed:

From
his
cradle,
Francis Bacon was brought up
in
sight of the
rearing of horses and the culture of the stable. Before the division of
Ireland that began in the Protestant uprising in Ulster in 191 3, the
great houses mixed Roman Catholic and Church of England behev-
ers with abandon. The thing was for servants to believe, and so serve

and obey. The two housemaids and die cook were
Cadiolic,
die
nurse an English Protestant. Seven Catholic grooms were matched
by three young English grooms. The
Protestant Ascendancy had
ruled in Ireland for two-hundred-and-fifty years since Cromwell's
ruthless
invasion and
the Batde
of the Boyne, and
the
flight
to
France of the 'Wild Geese' Catholic army after the fall of Limerick.
Now the Protestants held most of die land, certainly within the Pale
around Dublin, where Ireland was ruled from the Casde. Home
Rule seemed far better than Independence to most of the governing
classes. 'In Ireland there was a common Irishness,' a historian of the
Anglo-Irish, Michael McConville, has written, 'but one part of the
country looked upon the
other
as
"garrison" and
the
"garrison"
regarded the other part with at best a superior benevolent affection,
laced with a standing suspicion that
it was superstitious and unreli-
able.' The centre of upper-level Anglo-Irish and Unionist social life
was the Kildare Street Club in Dublin, and there Honorary Major
Anthony Bacon could meet like minds, since nearly everybody had
served in the army at one time or another and knew that a show of
force was
necessary
to keep
a
potential
Irish
rebellion down. A
period of military
service
in
India
generally took the
place
of a
university in Irish county family life, while the classics in the libraries
of the great houses were replaced with books on
field sports and
memoirs of obscure colonial campaigns.
'From childhood', C. S. Andrews, the author oi Dublin Made Me^
asserted,
'I was aware that there were two separate and immiscible
kinds
of
citizens:
the
Catholics
of whom
I was
one,
and
the
Protestants, who were as remote and different from us as if they had
been blacks and we whites. We were not acquainted with Protestants
but we knew
that
they were
there -
a
hostile
element
in
the
community, vaguely menacing to us.' And they did become positively
menacing in 1913, when the Ulster Volunteers were organised
to
protest against a new Home Rule Bill which was said to mean Rome
Rule. Twenty-thousand modern
rifles from Germany were landed
the next year at Larne in the north of Ireland, soon matched by a
consignment of fifteen-hundred Mauser
rifles for the Irish Volun-
teers, shipped by private yacht to Howth Bay in the south. Rumours
of plots to seize army munitions at Armagh and Omagh and other

1

Francis Bacon
barracks bedevilled the messes. Orders for the troops at the Curragh
to move to protect military depots were misinterpreted as a surprise
attack on Protestant Ulster. Brigadier-General Hubert Gough and
sixty-four
other
cavalry
officers,
w^hose mounts were
sometimes
supplied by Honorary Major Bacon, sent a memorandum to Com-
mand Headquarters that they wouhd 'respectfully and under protest
prefer
to be
dismissed',
if ordered
to move north
against
Ulster.
They were not dismissed, but there appeared to be a sort of private
bargain, between
the Government
in London and
the
rebellious
officers, to ignore the mutiny. This resulted in the resignation of the
Secretary of State and the Prime Minister felt obliged to take over
the
Seals of the War Office
in such
a
'great public emergency'.
Ireland seemed on the brink of civil conflict, although the army there
was to mobilise for another one, the First World War.
That mobilisation and the Cavalry manoeuvres preceding
it were
among the
first long-held memories of the
four-year-old Francis
Bacon at Canney Court, only fifteen miles from the Curragh. There
were the sounds of hooves galloping in the woods nearby, the rattle
of gunfire
at night. But this was a distant menace, a violence that
was not seen. His grandmother's husband, Walter Loraine Bell, had
left the Duhallow country and had taken the Leix hounds for two
seasons before the First World War. The child was terrified at Bell
stringing up cats when he was drunk and making his grandmother
and his mother and her brother Peter lock themselves in cupboards
when
the
Master
of the Hunt
approached. He
put them
onto
unbroken horses, so that they rode in fear of their lives. He was not
only a sadist and a bully to humans, but he was known as 'Cat' Bell
for
his
appalling cruelty
to these unfortunate
animals. He would
throw them to the Leix Hounds in order to give the dogs a taste for
blood.
First, he would put the cats in sacks, and when their claws
showed through, he would cut these off so that the cats could not
scratch the hounds at the moment of death. Such mutilation of the
flesh forever remained in the mind of the small boy, who later heard
that his beloved grandmother had to divorce 'Cat' Bell for cruelty.
Yet she always rode superbly, kept the same straight back and figure
at
fifty years old as
at seventeen, and was made formidable by the
hard knocks inflicted by her second husband.

The Bells had leased for eight years a large place
at Farmleigh
near Abbeyleix. The
little
Francis remembered the
semi-circular
bow windows and the wide view over open country. He was always
to like great houses and their spaciousness, the large rooms leading
through to the arc of the view outside. He later thought that perhaps
it was one of the reasons why he often used curved backgrounds in
his
triptych
paintings. The
visiting
of each
other's
houses,
so
important
in
Anglo-Irish
society,
also
gave
the
child
a
sense
of
roodessness and a taste for encounter and strange places. His mother
was
sociable,
although
his
cantankerous
father
could
keep
few
friends outside the
Bells and the Barrys and the
Firths. His rare
supporter in County Kildare was Mrs 'Cub' Kennedy, who married
a bloodstock breeder, and the agent of the Earl of Clonmel. She had
been Doris Lumsdaine of Sydney and had known Francis Bacon's
Australian
grandmother. When
Lord
Clonmel
died
after
being
carried round each window of his
stately home
to
say, 'Goodbye
Bishopcourt', the Kennedys moved in and helped to bring up Harley
and Francis Bacon with their own children. Bishopcourt, Farmleigh,
Canalway Lodge and Canney Court were
the
four poles
of the
existence of the child who would be an artist.
The Kennedy daughter remembered the boy Francis. While the
men said that he was rather a
sissy and did not
like horses, she
recalled that 'we adored dressing up and talking about clothes'. His
softness and sensitivity brought out the worst in his own father, who
was rigid and narrow-minded and opinionated. His niece, Pamela
Firth, found that he had a crushing force of personality and flew into
violent rages if anything in his structured life went wrong. He would
throw his boots around if they were not polished to perfection and
curse at all the world. As his son Francis was to observe, he was 'an
intelligent man who never developed his intellect at all'. He believed
in training his children as he did his horses for an army career. In
fact, Francis only appeared to dislike the discipline and bigotry of
his male
parent. He would
later
recognise
that he
felt
a
sexual
attraction to his father when he was a child.
The boy loved his mother, who was warm and outgoing, although
as conventional as his father. She was excessively tidy, even dusting
the
tops
of
doors.
She
always
remained
cool
and
upright and

14
Francis Bacon
unflustered, detaching herself from her husband's wrath. She never
moved her neck, but turned her whole body
to look round or to
speak. 'My dear, you are making a big mistake
.
.
.' was her favourite
phrase. She was not maternal to Francis, but shared her love between
him, his elder brother Harley and younger one, Edward, who was to
die
early,
at the age of four years
old, from his weak chest. This
death caused the only display of emotion that Francis ever saw in his
father, who loved his smallest son - perhaps because Edward was at
the age where he could only give
love without conditions and
in
ignorance. Edward was buried
in Kildare near his grandmother's
house. But Francis's elder brother Harley was a kind of protection,
and the first happy memory recorded by Francis was parading along
an avenue of cypresses, enveloped in the snuggery of his brother's
bicycling cape, unusual comfort in a hostile world.
The mobilisation
in Ireland
for the
First World War led
to an
upheaval in the
life of the Bacon family. Something like a wave of
relief and patriotism swept the country.
It was no longer to be a war
of brother against brother in Ireland, but a united stand against the
despotic Hun, who had occupied
little Belgium as the English had
Ireland. Among the allies over the water was Catholic France, where
the Wild Geese had fled more than two centuries before in order to
continue
their long
struggle
against
the
English.
But
this
time,
outside the Irish Volunteers and the nascent Irish Republican Army,
there was a flocking to the colours. In the eighteenth century, almost
half-a-million Irishmen crossed the seas
to serve
in foreign wars,
and
fifty thousand
fell
in
battles such
as
Fontenoy,
fighting
the
English.
In
the
First World War,
another
half-million
Irishmen
fought for the
B^-itish Army and another fifty-thousand were killed
over four years in that decimation. As the song went:
For we carried our packs for Marshal Saxe
When Louis was our King,
But Douglas Haig's our marshal now
And we're King George's men,
And after a hundred and seventy years
We're fighting for France again.

The Irish had long tolerated the presence of the occupying British
Army rather as the Jews tolerated the Roman legions in the Holy
Land at the time of Christ. For generations, many famiUes had sent
their
sons
to
serve
in
that
army
from
tradition
and
economic
necessity. Ireland was administered as one of seven commands that
covered
the
British
Isles. The
regular
establishment was
thirty-
thousand men,
consisting of two regular infantry
divisions and
a
cavalry brigade, concentrated mainly on Dublin and Cork and the
Curragh. The 3rd Cavalry Brigade, which performed its manoeuvres
in the woods near Canney Court, had its headquarters at the Curragh
and two of its regiments, the
i6th Lancers and the 4th Hussars,
while the
third regiment of the 5th Lancers was
at Marlborough
Barracks in Dublin. Included in the Formation was a brigade of the
Royal Horse Artillery with two batteries, one
field troop of signals
and one of engineers. These batteries were the
first rumble of big
guns that the child Francis Bacon heard in the prelude to the First
World War.
The mobilisation of the British Army in the United Kingdom and
Ireland was ordered on Tuesday afternoon, 4 August 19 14. Although
the Galway Races were proceeding, the officers and men had been
kept in the barracks over the Bank Holiday weekend against such an
eventuality.
'It was a warm, calm evening,' the commander of the
Connaught Rangers
recalled,
'a veritable calm before
the
storm.
After years of work we could set all this machinery in motion by one
word, "mobiUse".' That machinery and that mobilisation ended the
effective presence of the British Army in Ireland, except for Ulster
in
the
north. The
regular
establishment was
reduced
to
a
few
thousand men, while another three
divisions were
authorised by
Lord Kitchener to be recruited, one in Ulster and two in the South.
'The
stoutest men from
hill,
valley, and town came pressing into
the British Army,' Sean O'Casey noted. 'Long columns of armed
Irishmen went swinging past Liberty Hall down to the ships at the
quays waiting to take them to a poppy-mobbed grave in Flanders.'
The Connaught Rangers marched out of Boulogne towards
their
end in the trenches singing an unknown song called Tipperary, which
became the nostalgic refrain of the war.
The child Francis Bacon watched the soldiers leave the Curragh

for Flanders, the cavalry and the 14th Infantry Brigade, the Suffolks
and the East Surreys, the Manchester Regiment and the Duke of
CornwalFs Light Infantry. But his father could not join them, much
as he wanted to serve, particularly in the regiments which sometimes
rode
the horses he bred. Honorary Major Bacon was too
old,
at
forty-four, to be required to fight in Flanders, and he had quarrelled
with
too many of the
cavalry
officers and
his neighbours
to be
thought a desirable recruit. The only post he was offered was at the
Territorial Force Records Office at London Wall, where he would
serve under a retired Colonel Adamson and administer the organis-
ation of the London and City of London Territorials, a job which
suited his rigorous and limited mind.
It was hardly a heroic role for
the Boer War veteran, but
it put him in uniform at a time when to
be out of it appeared to be cowardice. On the Army List, he was
given the tide of Temporary Captain, also Honorary Major retired.
Special Reserve. At least, he was again serving his country in some
capacity.
Like so many of the terraces of London, Westbourne Terrace was
a series of oblong boxes, like gigantic coffins stacked one on top of
the other to the height of four storeys - in a sense a mausoleum for
the living. Francis Bacon's father rented a house there for his family,
while he worked at the War Office. There were no large views over
the
rolling green
fields, only the wide black trench of the
street.
Along that
rut,
the double-decker motor-buses
ran,
the same
as
those which had brought
soldiers
to
the defence of Paris
at
the
Marne, also a few private motor-cars with monstrous flapping bags
of coal-gas attached to their roofs for fuel; and increasingly the mud-
coloured ambulances stained with their red crosses - the image of
blood against the ochre of earth - ferrying the wounded to hospital
from nearby Paddington Station.
There was an escape and an excitement
for the
child
Francis,
pretty now at the age of sk, with fair hair and pouting lips, but very
small and over-sensitive: a silent boy who took in all he saw. To him,
the curves of the great grimy glass roof of Paddington Station, on its
wrought-iron ribs, was another transparent curvature in front of the
sky - like the bay back windows of Farmleigh. Only
all was in soft
focus now, the steam rising from the panting engines, the soot and

the grime
floating
in
the
air and coating clothes and
bricks and
carriages. The vast station hall was not an enclosure before a bright
country, but a barrier against an enveloping darkness. And from the
trains,
the
troops came out in
their drab
ntvj colours,
the khaki
adopted by
the Tommies
in
the Boer War, and
the
blue -black
uniforms and
kepis of the Belgians. They emerged from crov^ded
compartments
as
long and
narrow^
as
the rooms
of Westbourne
Terrace. Their
rifles drew hard lines against the right angles and
edges of the steam engines and carriages. Their packs were square
hunchbacks. Their faces and bodies materialised from an obscurity
and gloom, and they returned to that same murk. As one traveller
from Dublin noted
after
a journey on
the
mail-boat
Ulster^
zig-
zagging
across
the
Irish
Sea
to
avoid German
submarines,
*In
London
I came into the penumbra, the partial shadow, the shadow
behind the shadow ... At night the shadow thickened. You moved
through dark streets, peered into shaded shops, as into caverns of
light, went on again
in the darkness, looked up
at a sky that no
longer held the glare of a city.'
Yet the London stations were also the escape route to the north
and Jesmond Towers, where the young Francis first wondered at art
and paintings. His wealthy great-aunt Highat Mitchell had married
an enthusiast for the Pre-Raphaelites; her husband Charles Mitchell
himself imitated their style in his own pictures, which he hung with
other
Victorian
masterpieces
in
the
enormous
ballroom
of the
mansion. There the small boy could see the defined flow and rich,
sombre colours of the Pre-Raphaelite
school, and he would
first
understand that paintings could be a part of family being, not just
the
still lives that hung dead on museum walls, where his philistine
father hardly took him. Life at Jesmond Towers was luxurious and
grand. Mrs
Mitchell
rented Bamburgh
Castie
one summer and
asked
all her relatives
to
stay with her in that stronghold
for the
impressionable
young. What with
the
grandeur
of the
northern
mansion and fortress, the small Francis acquired a Gothic sense of
opulence and ruin on a larger scale even than he had seen in the
great houses of Ireland.
The Park at the bottom of Westbourne Terrace, however, was the
daily
delight and panorama
of the
small
boy. He
recorded
the

1

Francis Bacon
military efforts to camouflage the grass and create the illusion of city
lights where none were. Another effort to deceive enemy bombers
was an equal failure. The lake in St. James's Park was drained and
dried out so that the reflection from the water might not signal to the
skies nearby Buckingham Palace and Whitehall. The bed of the lake
was even covered with huts to house civil servants, whose job was to
prevent
trading with
the enemy.
But
the Thames
could
not be
drained, and as its glistening serpentine skin was inscribed on every
German
raider's map,
no
removal of the
sheen
of water
could
prevent an aerial navigator from finding the heart of the metropolis
by following the bends of the river, especially as the shining railway
tracks also led straight from the counties into Euston and Padding-
ton, Victoria and Waterloo.
Along the Thames and in Hyde Park itself, barrages and lines of
shell
bursts were
set up
for
anti-aircraft guns. These
deterrents
against bombers were
given
fancy names
such
as The Ace
of
Spades' and *Mary Jane' and *No Trumps' and *Cold Feet'. They
were
ineffective
against the
first raiders, the
gas-filled Zeppelins,
which flew with impunity at an altitude of twenty-thousand feet. In
fact, the ineffective anti-aircraft batteries caused more damage to the
people of London than they ever inflicted on German dirigibles and
aeroplanes. The London guns could fire as many as forty-thousand
3 -inch shells in a single night against the high-flying Germans. Of
the fifteen-hundred
civilians
killed by
air raids in the whole
First
World War, one-third of the
casualties resulted from the
half-a-
million fair-sized pieces of metal that rained down from the heavens
when
the
mighty
barrages
were
let
loose.
Winston
Churchill
denounced the defence system of the capital as the instruments of
self-bombardment. These
shell fragments and shrapnel were
col-
lected by the child Francis in Hyde Park near the Hotchkiss
six-
pounder in the wide open space to the east, and below the searchlight
on the top of the gate
at Hyde Park Corner, or on the emergency
landing strip cleared for fighter planes. They were souvenirs to swap
with his brother Harley and the other boys, but also a reminder for
life of how easily and at random death might topple from above.
Yet the most enduring image of war in the boy's mind was the
unnecessary defence against low-flying aircraft installed in the Park.

Square struts with cross-bars were erected to grid the atmosphere,
to confine the
air. They trailed high wires
in a see-through
skirt.
This balloon apron was indelibly printed on the child's memory as a
box against existence, a futile sketch in metal versus an invisible foe.
Steel nets were also draped over the National Gallery and the War
Office and Buckingham Palace, although Queen Mary thought the
flimsy mesh no better than the wire round a poultry run. As useless
as the balloon apron, the steel nets did portray the city snared and
trapped within a delusion of precaution. The statue of Charles the
First in Trafalgar Square was surrounded by a cube of sandbags, as
were the tombs of the kings and queens in Westminster Abbey. So
would the future artist Francis Bacon imprison his screaming pope.
Perhaps
most
real
and
most
deceptive
to
Francis
were
the
exhibition trenches dug in Kensington Gardens to boost morale on
the home
front. They were clean and dry with squared sides and
sandbags
stacked
in
regular
rows. Those who had been
in
the
trenches
in Flanders, such
as the poet Wilfred Owen,
called the
Park trenches 'the laughing stock of the army'. The actual ones were
crooked, improvised and dark, muddy and smelly with the reek of
decay. And young as he was, Francis Bacon would have noticed the
subterfuge. For he was truly a child of the twentieth century, the
heir of the newsreel and the photograph. He saw the truth of trench
warfare
in
black and
white,
the
haphazard and
the
ramshackle
structures,
the mud
and
the
danger and
the
dying. From
that
awareness, he would often choose the monochrome and the snapshot
as an insight into reality rather than the many-coloured surface of
what he could see, which might be only propaganda.
The warnings of air raids further unsettled the boy in Westbourne
Terrace. At the beginning of the war, the only alarms were sounded
by constables on foot or bicycle, ringing bells with TAKE COVER
placards hanging round their necks. They would reappear at the end
of the air raid with ALL CLEAR on the signs, while Boy Scouts and
the Church Lads Brigade sounded bugle
calls of relief, and
the
engine-drivers played cock-a-doodle-do on their train whisdes
in
Paddington Station. But after a while, maroons were
set
off, their
series of bangs making noises like the bomb explosions which they
were meant to announce. Then there would be the rolling drum taps

20
Francis Bacon
and dull chatter of the distant anti-aircraft barrages and the louder
thumps of the Hyde Park battery. And even more frightening was
the fizz and high-pitched whine of a dropping bomb and the curious
soft thud of its explosion nearby. And worst of all for a child - until
then reared
in
the country - would be
the barking of dogs and
screech of cats, who sensed the hum of the engines of the bombers
before
the humans heard and voiced
their
shrill
fear of death
to
come.
The boy had the opportunity to inspect some of the damage
in
central London, for the local devastation became the favoured tour
of the
sightseer and the
curious. There was
the bomb from
the
notorious Silent Raid by a Zeppelin, which blew a hole twelve-feet
deep outside Swan and Edgar's in Piccadilly Circus, and blasted the
famous actor Charles Havvtrey, then playing in The Saving Grace at
the
Garrick Theatre,
clean through
the
door of the
Trocadero.
There were the exposed girders of the explosion
at the Odham's
Printing Works, and the black square holes of the stage doors blown
away
at the back of the Strand Theatre. The bombs
eviscerated
houses and exposed the innards of family
lives. But most bizarre
were the twisted pipes and intestines of underground London, visible
on the Embankment in the early September of 191 7, with slabs and
blocks of stone strewn up
to the pedestal on which
a Sphinx lay
with her inscrutable smile looking along the raiders' path down the
Thames.
From the windows of Westbourne Terrace, however, the nights
were the most illuminating and unforgettable. For the beams of the
searchlights would
criss-cross
the
sky and
score
the darkness
in
triangles and lozenges and sharp, shifting patterns. It was a geometry
of brightness,
a light show that encased the dark briefly. And the
moon itself was at
first the defender and then the instigator of the
air raids. The Zeppelins were afraid of it, because they became too
visible as they sailed sky-high and mute above the metropolis. But
the moon was the friend of the bi-plane Gothas and Giants, which
followed the huge
dirigibles
in
their assault on
the
capital. They
would drop their bombs more accurately during the periods of the
Hunter's Moon and the September Harvest Moon, when they killed
and wounded ninety people
in
front of the main entrance
to the

An Awareness of War
2 1
Bedford Hotel in Southampton Row and on the full moon, when a
large bomb of 660 pounds destroyed the basement beneath Odham's
in Long Acre, crowded with Londoners seeking shelter there. The
bright sky was the signal of mass murder.
Yet perhaps for the child, the black-out was the ultimate fear, a
daily terror that lasted
all the years of the long world war. Street
lights were reduced and shaded. The interiors of trains and buses
were
darkened
into
a
miasma.
Blinds
had
to
be
drawn
across
windows before Hghts were switched on inside houses. Time seemed
to have stopped in the evenings and the early hours. Even the face
of Big Ben was kept sombre, and the counting of the ominous hours
over London could no longer be seen. There was only a dull gleam
on the pavement on starry nights, and the road was no brighter than
a country lane. Bodies of people would loom out of the obscurity
and disappear
again. Throughout the
future
portraits by Francis
Bacon,
distorted
figures would emerge from
a
fearful
night,
as
sudden and grotesque as the strangers glimpsed in the dim streets of
London in the black-out.
However, the keenest horror and the most terrible bogey was the
Zeppelin. As Air Commodore L. E. O. Charlton testified,
for the
better part of two years the whole country suffered under a Zeppelin
psychosis. *Not a Zeppy night tonight, thank God,' people would say,
scanning the
bright
sky, which they thought would protect them
from the murderous dragon above:
The Zeppelins were our tyranny during the War. On their account
men showed fear before their fellow-men and were not ashamed.
They laid bare our moral bones. Lacking the strength afforded by
discipline and training, such as belongs to the fighting man proper,
we were liable to confusion and panic. The airship approach was
furtive, essentially that of a night animal, and much more unman-
ning than the full-speed dash of the Gotha and the Giant which
tipped and ran. There was black magic in the monosyllable *Zep,'
and just as mothers would say 'Napoleon' to make their children
good a century ago, so now did they modernize the
threat. The
airship could be noisy or silent at will, motionless or swiftly moving.
Once
seen,
or
vividly described,
their monster bulk, ominously

22
Francis Bacon
shaped and
evil looking, could obsess the mind and endow them
with a fabulous power of destruction.
Seen from far below, the Zeppelins seemed like silver worms as they
emerged from
their cloud cover or writhed on
top of a cone of
searchlights. Later, their underbelHes were painted black to diminish
their
visibility. But the children who watched them over London
forever remembered the high serpent of the air and the terror that
dropped from
it. The Gothas and the Giants, however, looked no
more threatening than flights of moths or shoals of flying fish. When
the
first Zeppelin was brought down in September,
191 6,
it burst
into flames and exploded, its remnants crashing to earth near Enfield.
Tens of thousands went to see the charred bodies in the wreckage:
it was like Derby Day. Later that month, three more Zeppelins were
brought down by
fighters,
one
in
flames
over
Potter's
Bar.
Its
destruction interrupted the philosopher Bertrand Russell's first night
with Lady Constance Malleson. He heard 'a shout of bestial triumph
in
the
streets',
leapt out of bed and saw the
falling
fiery worm
illuminate the night sky.
If the boy Francis was
fast asleep
at the
time, he would have seen the pictures of the crashes or the display
of Zeppelin trophies, which was put on show in Finsbury. Among
them was one of the *spy baskets' which hung below the doomed
dirigibles. It looked like a torpedo with t^vo observation windows and
tail fins. It was another indelible image of war.
With
the
present bombardment
of the
senses
by
pictures
of
conflict and
atrocity from television screen, magazine and tabloid
newspaper,
it is difficult to assess the effect of the first newsreels of
war and occasional photographs of the Western Front on the mind
of a hyper-sensitive boy at his most impressionable age. The present-
day barrages of information and images are as useless and damaging
as the half-a-million pieces of shrapnel which
fell from the sky on
the heads of the Londoners after an anti-aircraft fusillade. But the
few black and white prints or moving pictures of war which Francis
Bacon saw, for the first time between the ages of six and eight years
old in London during its first blitz, imposed their impressions forever
on his receptive senses. He would always see much of the truth of
life in fear and wailing, darkness and bloat, distortion and violence.

An Awareness of War
23
As he later said,
'I was made aware of what is called the possibility
of danger even at a very young age.'
His
father
resigned from
his
job
at
the War
Office
after
the
Armistice and took the family back to Ireland to resume his horse-
training business,
first at Canney Court and then
at Farmleigh in
County Leix, which he now rented from his wife's mother. She was
an eccentric woman, in Francis Bacon's opinion, forever changing
houses. 'She had a very curious relationship with my father.
I think
he
disliked
her
very much,
but
nevertheless
they were
always
exchanging
houses.'
His
cousin, Pamela
Firth,
thought
that
the
Bacons were always moving, always visiting. A terrible resdessness
infused them all.
Yet this was no longer the Irish county society which Honorary
Major Bacon had
left. The Easter Rebellion of 191 6 had created
martyrs for Irish independence; sixteen of the leaders were executed
and another thirty-five-hundred sympathisers were
arrested. The
batde-lines between Catholic and Church of Ireland believers were
drawn. The era of the Protestant Ascendancy was ending and of the
Irish
rebellion beginning. Anthony Bacon was
still an Honorary
Major on the Special Reserve, and he may have played a part in the
formation of the counter-insurgency Black and Tans, which were
largely formed from those who had been Territorials, to fight the
Sinn Fein and
the
Irish Republican Army.
Certainly,
his
wife's
mother had desperately compromised the Bacon family by taking, as
her third husband, Kerry Leyne Supple, in 1917. He was the District
Inspector of Police for County Kildare, one of the most dangerous
and unpopular duties in all Ireland.
As Francis Bacon
left his boyhood and approached puberty, his
personal turmoils were played out in a land and time of troubles.
'Life
is violent, though,' he said as a mature
artist. Just the fact of
being born is a ferocious event.' He grew up in Ireland with the Sinn
Fein movement and lived through two world wars.
'I suppose all that
leaves some impression. You can't separate
life from suffering and
despair.'


A Time of Troubles
These things are commonly not observed, but left to take
their chance.
'Of the True Greatness of Kingdoms'
by Francis Bacon, Lord Verulam,
Viscount St. Albans
'I had no upbringing at all/ Francis Bacon told John Rothenstein,
then Director of the Tate Gallery,
in 1962, 'and
I used simply to
work on my father's farm near Dublin.
I read almost nothing as a
child - as for pictures,
I was hardly aware that they existed.' Yet his
asthma, an affliction he had suffered all his life, drove him to become
an artist. He could breathe in, but he could not exhale. The air was
trapped inside him, he could not get it out. His cousin Pamela Firth
would view him
fighting for breath
in his bedroom, throwing his
head around on the pillow, painful to watch. He was so
ill from his
weak chest as a child that nobody in the family expected him to live
to the age of twenty-one. 'He would gasp and heave, and
it was in
the
age before
allergies were known.'
It proved
in
the end
that
Francis was allergic to horses and dogs, exactly the animals which
surrounded him in Ireland. What he did not yet know was that the
grimy
air of cities would
suit his lungs
better. He could breathe
where others choked.
'It was his tremendous drive and defiance,'
Pamela said
later of him. 'He had to rebel against his family and
background.' One of his fondest memories was
to be those times
when he was allowed morphine by his father to quiet his asthma.
It
gave him, with all his nervous energy, the only true relaxation he was

26
Francis Bacon
to know lifelong, but he was never given enough to turn him into an
addict.
Asthma
is mainly a symptom of stress, and Francis Bacon was
distressed by his rootless and dangerous childhood, and above all, by
his love and hatred of his nervous and dictatorial father. *He certainly
didn't get on with his children,' t'rancis said, and he himself was the
most unpopular of all, a silent sissy with observant eyes. He bottled
up
his inner resistance and could not open
it. The
father was so
dominant in his
life that the early paintings by the son were either
detached
abstracts
or
crucifixions,
a testament
to
personal mute
suffering. Only after his father's death in 1940 was Francis Bacon
able to transmute his own early repression into images of universal
grief. Although he remained asthmatic, he found a release from his
breathlessness,
as
Proust
did,
in
creation
in
cities.
It
was
an
expression of what was life to him.
The asthma of the child prevented his acceptance by his father,
who merely thought the affliction was a weakness of character. He
was forced astride a pony and made to go fox-hunting. But when he
reached the meet, he started to choke on his allergy to horses and
blood sports. Later in his middle age, he was to demonstrate to Lady
Caroline Blackwood, then the wife of the painter Lucian Freud, that
the memory still agitated him. Recalling it, he would tug at his collar
as if he were trying to loosen a choking noose and he resembled 'the
agonised figures in his paintings whose faces turn a truly dangerous
shade of indigo purple as they go into the last stages of strangulation'.
She was also told by a homosexual friend of Bacon's that he had
admitted to being systematically and viciously horsewhipped by the
Irish grooms in front of the father he feared and loved. This parental
sadism was to haunt his sexual
life. 'Surely there's nothing worse',
he was to say to Lady Caroline, 'than the dusty saddle lying in the
hall.'
The recurrent bouts of asthma also prevented
his formal edu-
cation, which was hardly helped by the nomadic style of his family,
who thought
that a home was
like
a
field - the next one always
greener. Although later he would say he was not in the least religious
and that Christianity was a ridiculous harness to put on people, he
did admit that he was 'brought up in the Protestant faith and went to

A Time of Troubles
27
church as a child'. This act was, as he later knew, a public protest
against Catholicism - *and we all had to go to church'. His only tutor
was Lionel Fletcher, the Church of Ireland chaplain
at the great
house of Straffan, where his father's supporter Doris 'Cub' Kennedy
stayed with her Barton relations. Francis's grandmother Winifred,
now Mrs Kerry Supple, lived at Straffan Lodge with her husband,
the Kildare District Inspector of the Royal Irish Constabulary. As
the
Reverend
Fletcher was
also
a
successful
horse-dealer,
the
tutoring of the boy was
as much
in horses
as Homer,
although
Francis did acquire a taste for Greek drama. In later life, he always
expressed the regret that he had not learned ancient Greek, but his
passion for Aeschylus remained. He claimed the Greek playwright
was the source of his
first masterpiece. Fletcher's niece was to be
the mother of Lord Gowrie, who became the artist's friend in later
years and claimed to share the same roots in the village in County
Kildare.
Francis
admitted
to Grey Gowrie
that
the memory
of
Ireland was both important and traumatic for him and that
it did
affect the paintings.
Brought up between Farmleigh with his father, Canalway Lodge
with the Firths, and Straffan Lodge with his grandmother, Francis
had many opportunities to fear and see the Irish rebellion which was
to end with independence for all Ireland except Ulster. 'My parents
were the enemy of the Sinn Fein,' he said
later.
'I remember my
father saying: "If they come tonight, keep quiet and say nothing."'
His father did not fear being shot, but looted, with his motor-car
and horses appropriated for the good of the Irish Republican Army.
'He expected to be attacked, and on all the trees you'd see the green,
white
and
gold
of the
Sinn
Fein
flags.
All
the
houses
in
our
neighbourhood were being attacked.'
It was
still more terrifying at Straffan Lodge. 'My grandmother
was married to the Chief of Police in County Kildare and used to
live
with sandbagged windows and
ditches dug on
the
road
to
ambush cars.' The young Francis had to be driven round the ditches
through the
fields
to reach the Lodge. He was
told
that snipers
would be waiting on the edges.
'I lived with my grandmother a lot.
I
grew up in an atmosphere of threat for a long time.' One night, he
was driving with his step-grandfather Kerry Supple, when the motor-

28
Francis Bacon
car became stuck in the Bog of Allen. Lamps flashed like will o' the
wisps
all around them, banshee cries sounded from one rebel band
to
another
at
the
sight of their
prey. The
child and
the
police
inspector had
to abandon
their broken-down vehicle and squelch
their way to the nearest Big House. There, they were only taken
inside by the owners after being^vetted at the point of a gun.
To be
in
the
Royal
Irish
Constabulary had been
a
matter of
honour and prestige. Before the First World War, there had been a
hundred applicants for each vacancy. The ten-thousand officers and
constables were
the
forces of law and
order, but they had
local
knowledge
and
respect.
They
were
armed
and
operated
from
barracks and posts, but they were
a recognised part of the com-
munity. The
Irish rebellion changed
all that.
Its propagandist and
guerilla
leader, Michael
Collins,
saw
that
the
countryside
could
become the property of the rebels
if the Royal Irish Constabulary
was frightened and humiliated. For
it was mosdy drawn from the
Roman Catholic small farmers who occupied the land.
An anathema was passed on the police force by the Sinn Fein and
its women's arm, the Cumann-na-mBan. At Mass, nobody would sit
in a pew occupied by a ^peeler'. A woman who went with a policeman
had her hair shaven. One woman had pig's rings put in her buttocks
for supplying milk to a police barracks, and a donkey was stabbed in
the forehead for carting turf there. No tradesman or farmer dared to
supply the barracks. The old weapon of the boycott was enhanced
by intermittent intimidation. The constable's life was spent
in constant apprehension of danger. If he would go out of barracks,
he was compelled to do so as one of a party operating in practically
an enemy's cctuntry. He could never predict the moment when a
hail of bullets would burst upon him from
a carefully prepared
ambush, his assailants being the apparendy harmless citizens who
surrounded him every day. Every means was employed
to tempt
him from his allegiance. Letters reached him warning him to resign
if he wished to escape the death penalty.
The Cumann-na-mBan cursed the police with the Aceldama or Field
ofBlood:

A Time of Troubles
29
For money their hands are dipped in the blood of their people
.
.
.
They are the eyes and ears of the enemy.
Let those eyes and ears know no friendship.
Let them be outcasts in their own land.
The blood of the martyrs shall be on them and their children's
children, and they shall curse the mothers that bring them forth.
The rebellion began with sporadic assaults on the scattered police
barracks, some of which were only stockades held by a dozen men.
The
attacks spread from the south and west to cover
all
Ireland.
Constables were murdered on duty and off-duty, and they began to
retire
to
their
fortified
district headquarters. By August
1920,
a
thousand constables had resigned, a tenth of the force. Meanwhile,
in commemoration of the Easter Rising, Michael Collins ordered
the abandoned barracks to be put to the torch, and a hundred-and-
eighty-two were set ablaze. To this day, outside almost every town
and many
a
village
in
Ireland
stands
a
ruin of recent
date,
the
quarters of the Royal Irish Constabulary.
The riposte of the British was to recruit auxiliaries for the police.
The
first of these took the nickname of the 'Black and Tans', later
to be known by the regular British Army as the 'Blacks and Scum'.
They wore the black jacket of the Royal Irish Constabulary over the
khaki trousers of the Tommy, but these colours were also those of
the Limerick Hunt, called the Black and Tans. This debris of the
First World War treated Ireland as an occupied country to loot and
terrify, while all Irishmen were murderers or 'Shinners'. Their ranks
were supplemented by the more disciplined and formidable auxiH-
aries, who had been army officers with good records. These recruits
were trained in police work at the Curragh and wore a dark green
uniform with a tam o'shanter and crowned harp badge. Mobile in
their armoured cars and tenders, they were intended to answer the
flying columns of Michael Collins the length and breadth of Ireland.
Although the new Chief of Police, General Tudor, rearmed the
Royal Irish Constabulary with rifles and machine guns, and also had
the barracks fortified with steel shutters, there was a mutiny of the
force at Listowel. The constables refused to hand over their quarters
to
the
military and
take up
dangerous
positions
in
the
outlying

30
Francis Bacon
countryside. And then and there, the war of atrocity was declared
official
by
a one-armed
veteran,
Colonel
Smyth,
the
Divisional
Commander for Munster. 'Now, men,' he announced, 'Sinn Fein
has had all the sport up to the present, and we are going to have the
sport now ... If a police barracks is burned or if the barracks already
occupied
is not suitable, then the best house in the locality is to be
commandeered, the occupants thrown into the gutter. Let them die
there - the more
the
merrier.
Police and mihtary
will patrol
the
country
at
least
five
nights
a
week.
They
are
not
to
confine
themselves to the main roads, but make across the country,
lie in
ambush and when
civilians
are seen approaching,
shout "Hands
up!". Should the order be not immediately obeyed, shoot and shoot
with
effect.
If the persons approaching carry their hands
in
their
pockets, or are in any way suspicious-looking, shoot them down.' At
the end of this speech, five more constables resigned from the force.
Atrocity was now matched by atrocity, ambush by ambush. Eighty
victims had been detailed by Michael Collins to be killed on Bloody
Sunday, and a force of Irish Volunteers gathered on Baggot Street
Bridge
for
this
purpose;
but
only
fourteen
British
officers were
murdered, two in Baggot Street where Francis Bacon was bom. A
seventy-year-old woman, Mrs Lindsay, was torn to pieces by women
of the Cumann-na-mBan
for informing the
British
forces
of an
ambush. A Resident Magistrate was buried up to the neck in sand at
low tide to watch the sea-water rising to drown him. Between April
and June
1920, some
sixty towns and
villages were
'fired up'
or
partially wrecked by British soldiers and auxiliaries. At Templemore,
the Northamptonshires raided a drink shop and a draper's, dressed
in women's blouses, and burned and sacked the town. Eventually,
Cork itself was pift to the flame in an orgy of destruction. Curiously,
the general who had led the mutiny at the Curragh before the First
World War, Sir Hubert Gough, warned against government policy:
'I don't think any truthful or sane person can avoid the conclusion
that the authorities are deliberately encouraging and, what
is more,
actually screening
reprisals and
"counter murder" by
the armed
forces of the Crown.'
Worse than the actual atrocities - for hardly more than a thousand
people were
killed on both
sides
in the
rebellion and damage
to

A Time of Troubles
31
property was assessed at only five-and-a-half million pounds - far
worse were the rumours and fears of violence. In the words of one
witness:
Terrible
tales were whispered
in those
final weeks of the dying
year.
Tales of frenzied men hunted by bloodhounds. Tales of
pitiless ambushes, of police slaughtered to a man, and the bodies
hacked to pieces with axes. Tales of savage reprisal followed on
shameful deed, of burned shops, of deserted farms, of peasants
gone to couch with fox and hare. Tales of new proclamations and
new restrictions falling alike on guilty and innocent
.
.
. Tales of
gross murder of isolated police repHed to by tales of blindfolded
prisoners taken at dead of night to lonely places and there told they
were to
die, made to kneel praying and listen while a grave was
dug, and this play-acting done, the victim promised life if he would
say was his neighbour, the butcher, a peaceful citizen or a follower
of Sinn Fein
.
.
. Tales that the golden age of robbery had come.
As well as the tales, pictures of the atrocities were widely circulated.
The same witness was shown negatives of the outrages.
The publication of these negatives no Irish firm would risk; in fact,
had their mere existence been known to the perpetrators, death
would have been the certain fate of their possessor. In one, the
Irish wife of a
British
officer, about
to become
a mother, was
shown shot to death in the stomach. In another, an Irish girl, who
had accompanied
a
British
officer
to
a tennis
party,
lay by the
roadside, her white dress drenched with blood; in his car, a few
feet away, could be seen the body of her escort, riddled through
and through with bullets.
These were the tales and images of the war in Ireland which Francis
Bacon would have heard and seen, while he was staying with his
grandmother and her police
officer husband
in
fortified
Straffan
Lodge. They were even more terrifying than the images of the First
World War, because this was a
civil war which shattered the boy's
memories of his early years before he had heard the manoeuvres and
the guns of the Lancers
in the dark wood. Even
in Kildare,
the
situation had worsened. In 191 9 the Sinn Fein could be countered

32
Francis Bacon
at the elections by the Hunt Club stopping Punchestown Races, the
County's great holiday, and the course where Bacon's
father and
uncle had so often run their horses. But by the time the boy reached
twelve
and
the
fratricidal war was
being
fought
to
a
ferocious
stalemate and a bitter Treaty, there was bad blood in every head and
evil memories of that time. Later, Francis Bacon was to recall one
incident in particular which was
to influence
his pictures of dead
meat hanging in a butcher's shop. He retained the image of men's
bodies hanging on a gate. In
fact, he did not see
it, he heard of it
from the Supples. Every evening, a guard of members of the Royal
Irish Constabulary would arrive to watch over Straffan Lodge. One
dusk they failed
to appear. They had been ambushed outside the
great house of Lord Mayo. As they tried to escape by clambering
over his locked iron gates, they were shot in the back and
left to
hang there.
Francis Bacon heard other
tales from the maids
at the Supple
house. His grandmother had lost nearly
all of her hair and had to
wear a wig, while her husband had
lost
all of his. One
night, the
Shinners did evade the guards and reach the dining-room, where
the police
officer was eating with
his wife. The gunmen made
a
noise
and
the
couple
dived
under
the
table. Two
bald
heads
confronted the would-be killers, who were local men and knew the
Supples well. 'We can't risk shooting the lady,' they are supposed to
have
said before disappearing into the darkness. Hanging on the
walls behind the terrified couple were the Unen sheets decorated by
his grandmother in her endless crewel stitch - the oblongs and lines
of cages with which Francis would frame the hunted creatures of his
later paintings.
There was more evidence of war in the countryside. Trees were
felled across the road to stop the passage of the armoured cars. Walls
were tumbled to the ground and made into pyramids of masonry' to
halt the police tenders. And little movable bridges were erected over
the trenches dug across the highway, so that the lorries of auxiliaries
could
still pass through. But most horrifying were the engines of
military transport, the heavy waggons filled with soldiers in tin hats,
and the Crossley tenders packed with the Black and Tans. Soon the
backs of the lorries were caged with wire netting as the buildings in

A Time of Troubles
33
London had been, to protect the soldiers from lobbed grenades. In
Dublin and
the
cities,
the
rebel
children
cried
'Chook,
chook,
chook!' as the police passed under their mesh. And the word was,
*The Boers put them
in khaki, the Germans put the
tin hats on
them; but it took the Sinn Feiners to put them into cages.'
The cage round the body of the screaming pope has been a primal
image in the paintings of Francis Bacon, although
it is hard to
tell
whether the pope
is shouting
at the cage of his Holy Office
or
protesting at the cage of belief he has
set about his worshippers.
Bacon himself saw the cages in Hyde Park and around the monu-
ments of London, threatened with German bombs, and he also saw
the cages round the
British troops and
auxiliaries
in
Ireland. He
heard of the internment camps
for
the
Catholics
at
Ballykinler,
where eighteen-hundred men were held in ^two big enclosures they
call cages'. He knew of the Pale in which they lived, that invisible
enclave
around
Dublin which
represented
Protestant
rule
over
rebellious Catholicism. He knew of the result of the Treaty of early
1922, which caused another civil war among the Irish rebels because
of the partition of the island between Ulster and Eire. He did admit
to having been very interested in religious things when he was young,
and
he would
have
imbibed
the
Protestant
bigotry
against
the
despotic Pope, longing
to oppress
Protestant freedom within the
power of Rome. Equally, he could see the Catholics imprisoned by
the oppression of the Protestant minority and screaming to get out,
as the women had in their hundreds outside the walls of Mountjoy,
when
the
Irish
captives went on
hunger-strike
until
death. And
above
all,
Francis Bacon screamed
to
liberate himself as well
as
those who were caged by religion or colonialism or history or war.
His
censorious
father had
set
a
trap
about
his
nature and
his
impulses, and he howled in silence to kick free.
He could see that the great houses which he loved in Ireland were
doomed along with the Protestant Ascendancy and its stern morality.
The civil war between the two factions of the triumphant rebels was
nastier and bloodier than the rebellion had been. The British troops
handed over the Curragh and their other barracks, their armoured
cars and their horses and their guns, to the forces of the Provisional
Government, and then they trained their old enemies to defeat the

34
Francis Bacon
Irish Republican Army - a thing which they had not achieved. As
Lord Birkenhead declared when he wished success in arms to the
Provisional Government which had accepted the Partition Treaty,
'I
would far rather that they were undertaking that task than we were
...
it
will
result
in
an economy
of British
lives.'
Although
the
government army had
enlisted some members of Sinn Fein who
believed
it was a stepping-ston^ to power, most of its members were
demobiHsed regular soldiers from the First World War, armed with
British weaponry and led by commanders who had fought for the
British
in
France. By
1923,
the new
National Army reached
a
strength of sixty-thousand men, twice the size of the British Estab-
lishment keeping down Ireland at the beginning of the century. With
this
superiority,
it
did
reduce
the
Irish
Republican Army
to
a
nuisance and only a permanent threat to partitioned Ulster. Ironi-
cally, the same heavy lorries covered with mesh and Crossley tenders
would leave the
fortified
cities to hunt down the elusive
guerillas,
just as the
British had done. Yet now,
it was a war of the green
against the green.
From Straffan Lodge and Farmleigh, the adolescent Francis Bacon
watched this tragedy of internecine independence. He also watched
the beginning of the end of the great houses of Ireland. The Sinn
Fein gave the Firths three days to quit Canalway Lodge before they
burned
it. The family fled to Dublin Castie, where an uncle was in
command of troops, and then on to a Georgian mansion. Cavendish
Hall in an English village in Suffolk. In fact, Canalway Lodge was
occupied, not burned down. But between January and November
1922,
fifty country houses and mansions were
destroyed. By the
early spring of the next year when the Irish civil war came to an end,
another eighty-nine had gone to waste and fire. The question of the
protection of Loyalist houses had been asked before the Irish
civil
war had increased the destruction of the great houses. 'If the military
reprisals go on, there will be no Loyalist houses
left. How can you
quell a rebellion by burning a farmer's house worth /^8oo when he
can burn a landlord's mansion worth £20,000.^' Both in the rebellion
and the civil war, the guerillas revised the old system of 'coyne and
livery'. Like the
gallowglasses and kernes of the ancient kings of
Ireland, the armed bands scoured the countryside, living free on the

A Time of Troubles
35
inhabitants, requisitioning food and money and motor-cars, driving
away the
cattle and
looting the houses, which were
also burned
down. One family's house in Cork was raided on no less than seventy
nights by armed youths who wore no uniform and used it as a supply
base. As a contemporary Irish historian wrote:
The motives behind these burnings were also various. Some were
punishments decreed by the Irregular Executive against any who
dared to serve the 'usurping Government.' Others were the work
of mere bands of robbers; others again that of peasants who, on
pretext of reprisals for the execution of rebels, burned down the
mansion and then seized and divided up the demesne. But what
was perhaps the most sinister in its significance was that, not only
did
the people
reputed
respectable
in
the
countryside -
small
farmers and others - do nothing to stop these outrages, but that
they often crowded to share in the plunder. As General Mulcahy
said in the Dail, 'Everybody minds his business and many people
take their litde bit when it comes their way.'
A genealogist and chronicler of the great houses in Ireland saw in
their destruction the end of many centres of civiUsation and culture,
such
as
the
library containing Gaelic manuscripts
in Marfield
in
Tipperary, the Palladian house of Summerhill in Meath once rented
by Elizabeth Empress of Austria for the hunting, Desart in Kilkenny
where the few salvaged treasures were looted at a road-block. *The
ruined Big House became part of the Irish landscape, best known to
followers of hounds who rode across country. The Land Commission
divided lawn and parkland into smallholdings of thirty acres. There
was an
air of triumphaUsm about their work, which continued for
many years.' Bacon himself, at the age often, remembered spending
a night in a haunted Irish Big House, half-mad with fear at its ghosts
and impending doom.
With the levelling of the great house came the lessening of the
Protestant Ascendancy. It was not wholly despoiled, but it became as
irrelevant
as
the French
aristocracy had
in
that
sister
Republic.
There was
emigration back
to
England.
In
191 1,
there were
a
quarter of a million people on the rolls of the Church of Ireland; by
1926, half that number; fifty years later, less than half that. Ironically,

36
Francis Bacon
in the twenty years after the Irish Free State was Hberated from the
British yoke, nearly one-third of its Catholic population also emi-
grated to oppressive Britain. It was hard to see what the troubles and
the fight for freedom had been about.
Yet for the young Francis Bacon, also soon to return to England
with his family, the turbulent days were over. He had enjoyed the
visiting of the great houses,
their strangeness and
their
style, and
now they were diminished. He always kept with him, however,
a
picture of their extravagance and
their welcome,
their excess and
their humour. But
it was in his father's establishment at Farmleigh
that he had to face his own nature in the culture of the stables, a
recognition that would lead him into a bohemian way of life in those
wayward quarters of cities, which hardly found his behaviour crimi-
nal or queer.
Francis Bacon said that it was only later, through the grooms and
the people in the stables he had affairs with, that he realised he was
sexually drawn towards his martinet of a father. While he was
still a
minor and an adolescent, he was made conscious of his homosexual-
ity.
It was not the usual homo-erotic fondlings of the English public
school of the period. In his erratic education, Francis only attended
one small public school. Dean Close in Cheltenham, for one year,
and he ran away so frequently that he was not made to return. But
his prettiness and smallness and love of dress and quiet ways made
him an easy mark of desire to the
Irish grooms, who took him as
easily and brutally as a stallion might a mare. There
is a rampant
sexuality in a horse-breeding establishment: all is stamp and rut and
whinny. It was as hard for Francis to avoid the evidence of the nature
around him
as
it was
for him
to recognise
the
truth of his own
nature.
The problem was his guilt. He knew that his father, who secretly
attracted
him, must
never know. Or
the punishment would
be
terrible. He was still religious at that young age and the anathema of
the Church against sodomy was utter. And so was the penalty of the
law. The
fate of Oscar Wilde
still reverberated through society on
both sides of the Irish Channel. And though a quick sexual encounter
was the most natural thing in the world in a place designed to breed

A Time of Troubles
37
horses, the young Francis feared the verdict of his father and the law
and the Bible.
Wilde had been the Faust and the Mephistopheles of homosex-
uality. As Faust, he was doomed for flouting society and parading
his
taste
for stable-boys and guttersnipes. As Mephistopheles, he
was judged for enticing the young Lord Alfred Douglas and Robert
Ross and other leading members of society. Before Sigmund Freud's
Three Essays on a Theory of Sexuality of 1905 became widely read in
Britain after the First World War, homosexuality was considered a
disease as well as a crime. Wilde's oblique defence of it in The Picture
of Dorian
Gray
was,
as
his
leading biographer
said,
'a
negative
version' of Wilde's own homosexual existence. The desire of boys
and men
for
each
other was
seen
as
dangerous
and
evil
and
destructive. So the adolescent Francis Bacon saw himself, another
Dorian Gray, in his early affairs.
The First World War was also fought on the home front against
homosexuality.
Lord
Alfred
Douglas
himself proved
particularly
treacherous in equating a homosexual with a
traitor.
'It
is
just as
important to
civilization', he wrote,
'that Literary England should
be cleansed of sex-mongers and pedlars of the perverse,
as
that
Flanders should be cleared of Germans.' His strictures were backed
up by the Manual ofMilitary Law, which set two years' imprisonment
for any act of gross indecency by a male in public or in private, and
ten years to
life as the sentence for sodomy. During the course of
the War nearly three hundred officers and men were court-martialled
for indecency, including an officer in the Grenadier Guards, who
was denounced by a nephew of Robert Ross. In a sense,
art had
been on trial in the case of Oscar Wilde, and the decadent upper-
class was judged in the case of the Grenadier Officer. The equation
was made plainer by the vicious antics of a Member of Parliament,
Noel
Billing, who claimed,
as
the
late Senator McCarthy would
with his list of American Communists, to have a Black List of 47,000
perverts reaching up to Prime Minister Asquith himself- all of them
capable
of
treachery
through
blackmail
by
the German
Secret
Service. He attacked a new production of Oscar Wilde's play Salome,
which he called 'The Cult of the Clitoris' and declared a vehicle for
sexual perverts, sodomites and lesbians.
It was being put on when

38
Francis Bacon
national existence was
at stake. He was sued for libel in the same
way as Oscar Wilde had ill-advisedly sued the father of Lord Alfred
Douglas. The trial was another trial of Wilde and had nothing to do
with justice. In his summing-up, Mr Justice Darling, himself named
in the Black List as a pervert, declared: 'Oscar Wilde wrote
filthy
works, as you know: he was gui'lty of filthy practices: he was convicted
in this Court and suffered imprisonment, and social extinction, and
death in due course
.
.
. Well, gentiemen, it is possible to regard him
as a great artiste, but he certainly was a great beast; there is no doubt
about
that.' The patriotic
jury, confusing every issue, returned
to
find the Member of Parliament innocent of all charges.
The
long
grim war
had made
Wilde
and
decadent
art
and
homosexuality come to seem a form of treason in most British and
Irish eyes. Duff-Cooper wrote to his wife Diana that nobody at the
front in Flanders spoke or thought of anything but the Billing case.
She repUed that Lord Albemarle had walked in to the Turf Club
and had said that he had never heard 'of this Greek chap
Clitoris
they are
all talking of. But at the front, in a womanless world, the
love of men for men was normal - a mere extension of the homo-
eroticism of the public school. So many of the leading literary figures
in pre-War days had been passive or active homosexuals along with
Wilde - Samuel Butier and Lord Alfred Douglas, Edward
Fitz-
Gerald and A. E. Housman, John Addington Symonds and Lytton
Strachey, John Maynard Keynes and Hugh Walpole, Edward Car-
penter and Montague Summers, E. M. Forster and J. R. Ackerley -
that the mutual love of men and boys seemed acceptable among
small coteries in London.
In his confessional. My Father and Myself, Ackerley wrote that the
army with its mak relationships was simply an extension of his public
school, although he never met a recognisable or self-confessed adult
homosexual during the War. The penalties were simply too severe.
But even the heterosexual Robert Graves in his obscure play. But It
Still Goes On, made his hero confess to the love of men for a good-
looking
officer.
'He's
a being apart: an
officer's uniform
is most
attractive compared with the rough shapeless private's uniform. He
becomes a sort of military queen-bee.' And then he agrees that the
officer drilling the men encourages the feeling, although 'they don't

A Time of Troubles
39
realise
exactly what's happening,
neither does
he; but
it's
a very
strong romantic link'.
This was the strong unconscious feeling which Francis Bacon had
for
his
father
in uniform who
drilled him
in
his
early days. His
escape was to the rough embrace of the grooms and stable-boys in
whose arms he could indulge his love for the father he thought he
hated.
But he was
too
vulnerable
not
to
feel
guilt. He
feared
exposure and expulsion and even imprisonment. Especially sensitive
and observant, he particularly felt as an adolescent the four crosses
of the homosexual at that time - isolation and
illegality, insecurity
and
guilt. To the end of his days, Francis Bacon would
tell some
friends that homosexuality was an affliction and a tragedy. At one
point,
it turned him into a liar and a crook. He could not talk about
his homosexuality, but only conceal
it. That was
its shame, the acts
that homosexuals were made to do by the vengeance of society, not
the sexual act itself.
Two
girls were born to the Bacon family in
Ireland, lanthe
at
Farmleigh in the March of 19 19, and Winifred Kerry in August two
years later at Straffan Lodge. The youngest and most unfortunate of
the members of the Bacon family was named after her mother and
her grandmother, and after her grandmother's third and
last hus-
band, Kerry Supple, who died that same year in 1921
of natural
causes, not from the gunshot wounds of the Sinn Fein or the Irish
Republican Army. Twelve years older than lanthe and fourteen years
older than Winifred Kerry, their brother Francis was hardly to have
any relationship with his young sisters, except in later years to pay
for the care of Winifred when she contracted multiple sclerosis and
to look after lanthe
in her old age
in South Africa. Generous
as
always, but growing distant from his kin, Francis Bacon's
rift with
his
past began
to widen with
his adolescence.
In
later years, he
would never visit Ireland again, because the memory of the turmoils
of his youth and his allergies to dogs and horses brought on such
severe attacks of asthma that he was likely to choke to death.
His habit of dressing up as a
girl with his playmates continued.
On a visit to the Firth family at Cavendish Hall with his parents, he
chose as his fancy dress to be a flapper of the 'twenties. 'He was very
distinctive,' Pamela Firth remembered. 'He never copied anyone.'

40
Francis Bacon
This time, he had his hair cut in an Eton crop, wore a beaded dress
dropping straight down to his knees, put on hanging ear-rings and
Upstick and
high
heels,
and
rolled
his
eyes
while
flourishing
a
cigarette-holder
a
foot
long.
'Isn't
Francis wonderful?'
Pamela's
mother said. 'Isn't he just like a girl.^' But even as a child often years
old, Pamela thought her cousin Francis was enjoying the role a little
too much. And his father was simmering with fury.
The explosion happened because Francis continued to try on his
mother's clothes
in
secret. His father discovered his son, dressed
only in his wife's underwear. There was a terrible outburst of rage,
which was compounded by the fact that Francis announced that he
wanted 'to do nothing' at all, or if he did anything, he wanted to be
an artist. It seemed to his parents that they had a small Oscar Wilde
on their hands, in the conventional and patriotic equation of art and
decadence and deviant behaviour. Later Bacon was to say that he
had never got on with his mother or his father. 'They didn't want
me to be a painter, they thought
I was just a drifter, especially my
mother.' There was no tradition in the family of anyone being an
artist, except the amateur Charles Mitchell ofJesmond Towers, and
his mother and father thought
it was a form of eccentricity at the
best. He would never earn a living as a painter, but equally they
could not stand having a pervert in their unhappy home. So, at the
age of sixteen, Francis was turned out of the Bacon house with an
allowance from his mother's trust fund from the Firth Steel business
of three pounds
a week, enough
to scrape an existence
in those
louche quarters of large
cities which would tolerate him. Later he
would say that Ireland was, anyway, a country of literature, not of
paint.
'It's because of the Church, of course, that people like Joyce
and, for a great "(deal of his time, Yeats, had to live out of Ireland.'
Rootiessness had been his way of life. His grandmother and his
parents had always been changing homes, drifting from one place to
another. 'My father and mother were never satisfied with where they
were,' he said. They moved back to England to Linton Hall on the
borders of Gloucestershire and Herefordshire, then back to Straffan
Lodge, where
Bacon's
elder brother Harley took up permanent
residence and trained horses like his father, before leaving for South
Africa. The Bacons then moved back to England again to an old

A Time of Troubles
41
rectory
at Bradford
Peverell near Dorchester,
for
the
Protestant
Ascendancy was truly over and the great houses were withering on
their foundations. Anthony Bacon's best friend, James Barry, had
been a Major in the 5th Royal Irish Lancers during the War, but he
still lived from hand to mouth, although he often visited his daughter
at Castle Martin
in Kildare near Canney Court. He himself had
become a marginal figure with the collapse of Anglo-Irish society,
and he could not prevent his friend Bacon from making a final return
to England.
Castle Martin, indeed, was
left to Grey Gowrie and
preserved his relationship with Francis Bacon, who never would go
back to Ireland again, particularly when the last member of his family
that he truly loved, his grandmother Winifred Supple, died in the
grand manner during a performance of Aida in the Metropolitan
Opera House in New York, where she was visiting her son Peter,
who had
fled
to
the
United
States
to
escape
his
creditors. So
spendthrift and hospitable was she
to the
last that her estate was
worth less than a thousand pounds.
In a way, his lack of formal education and his nomadic way of life
had prepared the adolescent Francis Bacon for a wandering existence
in the jungles of cities. He was not trained to a code or to a system
of ethics. He was unused to any pattern in his
life. He had hardly
ever answered a roll-call or slept in a dormitory. He had served in
no ranks and had never been regimented. He had preserved that
curiosity and questing innocence that is the great gift of childhood.
Above all, his creative growth had not been stunted by the regime of
the
classroom, and
his
extraordinary powers of observation were
untrammelled by any of the blinkers which art school or college may
put over young eyes in the name of a classical tradition. He had a
free vision and a long insight. And he was, as Walt Whitman once
wrote, ^as lawless as snowflakes'.
His
father had
bequeathed him
one
instinct:
a
fondness
for
gambling. As a child, he used to be sent to the Post Office to place a
last bet before 'the off. 'In Ireland', he said, 'there were professional
gamblers who made a living out of it, but then they had very good
inside information.' He himself disliked the horses and would take
up playing roulette at casinos. Although
it was the most stupid form
of gambling,
it did depend entirely on chance - an important element

42
Francis Bacon
in the future painter's
life.
It was 'the peculiar feeling that the gods
are with you and you are going to win.' He did not go to a casino
thinking he would
lose.
It was the same
all his
life: an optimistic
gamble that each occasion might turn up his lucky number - and
that life was an improvisation and a bet on another day.
Moving from
one
rented room
to
another
in
London,
often
skipping without paying the landlady when his allowance ran out,
Francis Bacon existed in the obscure streets of that metropolis for
more than two years, still following the demands of his sexual nature
that led him
to the existence of an urban gypsy. He read
a
litde
Nietschze
and
lost
the
last
shreds
of
his
religious
faith
while
contemplating some dog shit on a pavement. That was how Ufe was,
unless he made something remarkable out of it. And then one of his
last connections with
Irish
life appeared
late in 1927
to take him
away to a wilder life in Berlin. He said that his patron was a 'sporting
uncle', one of his father's friends, who knew of his reputation. He
also said on another occasion that his father sent him to an old army
friend in London, whom he hoped would teach his son to become a
man. Ironically, as Bacon told it later, the ex-officer fell in love with
his charge and ran off with him to Berlin.
It would not have been
James Barry, who was wild, but poor and heterosexual. The only
relation he had with the means and the inclination to take him to
Berlin was
Sir
Percy
Loraine, who was
the kinsman
of Walter
Loraine Bell, the second husband of Francis Bacon's grandmother.
The baronet had a long connection with racing in Ireland and the
army, and must have known Francis's father. Although he married
briefly in 1924,
it was not a success, and he
left alone to serve as
High Commissioner for Egypt and the Sudan. On one of his leaves,
he probably tool^ his 'nephew' of eighteen to Berlin. To this day, he
is remembered for liking young men and low life, and he would have
extended the experience and observation of Francis Bacon.

Travel, in the younger sort, is a part of education; in the
elder, a part of experience

change his country manners for those of foreign parts; but
only prick in some flowers of that he hath learned abroad

'Of Travel'
by Francis Bacon, Lord Verulam,
Viscount St. Albans
Francis Bacon was always conscious that his ancestor and namesake,
the Lord Chancellor of the reign of King James the
First, was, in
John Aubrey's words,
a pederast.
*His Ganimeds and
Favourites
tooke
Bribes;
but
his Lordship
always
gave Judgement secundum
aequum et honum': according to the just and the good. Both Francis
Bacons had
'a delicate, lively, hazel Eie
.
.
. like the Eie of a viper'.
They would hold a gaze until the prey submitted. Yet the eye of the
artist was that of a true chameleon spotting a
fly:
it would change
from hazel to green to brown to blue in the light of the day. Both
Bacons also shared the same pessimism about living. After looking
at the dog shit on the pavement and considering the futility of living,
the modern Bacon came to accept that he was alive, 'existing for a
second, brushed off like flies on the wall'.
It had been the same for
his namesake,
the Lord
Chancellor, who
declared
in one of his
poems:
The world's a Bubble, and the life of man
Less than a span;

44
Francis Bacon
In his conception wretched, from the wombe
So to the tombe;
Curst from his cradle, and brought up to yeares
With cares and feares.
Who then to frail mortality shall trust
But hmmes in water or but writes in dust
.
.
.
Our owne affections still at home to please
Is a disease;
To crosse the sea to any foreine soyle,
Perills and toyle;
Warres with their noise affright us; when they cease
W' are worse in peace.
What then remaines? but that we still should cry
Not to be borne, or, being borne, to dye.
The nascent artist Francis Bacon did not trust to frail mortality, even
at an early age, nor would he *limme' or paint in water. But he had
crossed the sea
to
a foreign
soil with
its
perils and
toil.
It was a
choice taken
at the same time by other young English poets and
writers, chiefly Wystan Auden, Christopher Isherwood and Stephen
Spender, while one of Francis's future friends and rivals was already
living there, Lucian Freud, before he came to England. The motive
of the
flight to Berlin was, in Auden's case, the
fact that
it was a
homosexual Mecca, where working-class blond boys could be picked
up at The Cosy Corner cafe
at the cost of a few marks. This was
also its attraction for Isherwood, who had been warned against it by
an elderly relative, who said it was the vilest place since Sodom: Tor
months
I had been day-dreaming of it as unrealistically as a child
dreams of the jungle; he hopes to meet tigers and pythons there, but
doesn't expect them to hurt him. A favourite
line of mine
at that
time -
I chose to take
it altogether out of the context of the play -
was lago's:
There's many a beast then, in a populous city.
And many a civil monster.
I arrived in Berlin on the lookout for civil monsters.'
He
and Auden
met
their
civil
monsters,

45
Hamilton, whom Isherwood was
to immortalise
in
his
novel, Mr
Norris Changes
Trains, with his comment that ^beauty was only sin-
deep/ A journalist for The Times and a blackmailer, Hamilton had
been imprisoned twice in the First World War, once for an act of
gross indecency with a male, and once for anti-British activities. But
as Stephen Spender wrote in his preface to his homosexual novel
about Germany, The Temple, which he did not risk publishing in
England until sixty years later when homosexuality between consent-
ing adults was
legal, young English writers and
artists
in the
late
'twenties were more concerned with censorship than with politics.
These were
the
last years of 'that strange Indian summer - the
Weimar Republic
.
.
. Germany seemed a paradise where there was
no censorship and young Germans enjoyed extraordinary freedom
in their lives.' In England, James Joyce's Ulysses was banned as was
Radclyffe
Hall's lesbian novel The Well of Loneliness, while D. H.
Lawrence's sexually explicit paintings and drawings were removed
from
a London
gallery wall by order of a
magistrate. As young
Americans such as Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway went to
France to escape Prohibition, so young English writers were fleeing
repression by going
to Germany. Tor them,
drink;
for
us,
sex.'
Isherwood even wrote back to a woman friend in England, boasting
that he was 'doing what Henry James would have done,
if he had
had the guts'.
There was almost an obsession among the refugee writers and
artists,
as Spender showed in writing The Temple,
to describe the
forbidden and the illegal, openly on show in Berlin in the clubs and
the cinemas and the galleries. During the Weimar years, there was
an extraordinary pricking in of the flowers of creativity. The Douino
Elegies and The Magic Mountain and SteppenwoIf^nd Wozzeck and The
Threepenny
Opera were
written.
The
Cabinet
of Dr
Caligari and
Pandora 5 Box were filmed, there were theatre productions by Piscator
and Jessner and Reinhardt, while the works of George Grosz and
Otto Dix were widely disseminated and Bauhaus architecture and
design announced a new age of materials and the machine. There
were new arts and a new language and new ideas, particularly on
sexual liberation.
Another motive
for Isherwood's
visit
to
Berlin was
to meet
a

46
Francis Bacon
Jungian analyst who preached, 'There
is only one sin: disobedience
to the inner law of our own nature. This disobedience is the fault of
those who teach us, as children, to control God (our desires) instead
of giving Him room
to
grow.'
In
Isherwood's
case,
as he
later
professed in Christopher and his Kind^ he resisted the dictates of the
State and the Church and the Law to marry a woman and breed.
''My will is to live according to my nature, and to find a place where
I can be what
I am ... If boys didn't exist,
I should have to invent
them.'
Isherwood ended his Berlin days living with an English homosex-
ual archaeologist suffering from syphilis, and lodging next door to
Dr Magnus Hirschfield's famous
Institute
for Sexual Science.
Its
museum contained the whips and chains, decorated boots and lacy
underwear of the
fetishists, also photographs of perverse practices
and famous homosexual couples such
as Oscar Wilde and Lord
Alfred Douglas. The French writer and
friend of Wilde, Andre
Gide, came to see the exhibits with Isherwood and was shown a live
one of a young man with two perfect female
breasts.
Later
the
American writers, Paul and Jane Bowles, appeared, who would make
Tangier their home before Francis Bacon arrived there. Dr Hirsch-
field campaigned for the repeal of Paragraph 175 of the German
Penal Code, which
officially punished homosexual acts as English
law did - only
it was honoured
in the breach rather than
in the
enforcement. A Penal Reform Bill was even drafted in the Reichstag
in 1929, but
it was shelved because of the stock market crash and
the rise of the Nazi party which was to burn the Reichstag itself and
put homosexuals in concentration camps.
In the days of the Weimar Republic, in the late 'twenties, however,
the attraction of Berlin was its licence. Auden mocked Isherwood in
his dedication to him of his
first book of poems, many written in
Berlin:
Let us honour if we can
The vertical man
Though we value none
But the horizontal one.

Prick in Some Flowers
47
He himself suffered from a rectal fissure dug out of his backside in
the homosexual trenches of Berlin.
In
his poems and
plays,
it
is
called 'The Wound', as though it were contracted in the true fighting
of a war.
Francis Bacon remembered Berlin in 1928 as a wide open
city,
but already very violent. The
night Ufe was
exciting
to
his
eyes,
because he had come
straight from
Britain, but the violence was
even more shocking as
it was emotional violence, not the
military
violence he had experienced
in
Ireland. He described walking
at
night down
a main
street lined with
side shows.
It was
a sexual
circus. Hawkers sold the skin play inside the booths to those who
could pay, while men and women mimed what might be seen inside
to attract the customers. Although Bacon did not stay in Berlin for
more than three months and did not
see,
as Isherwood
did,
the
destruction of the Weimar Republic by the
rise of Hitler, he did
observe the initial clashes of the Nazis and the Communists, recalling
*there was already an atmosphere of tension and unease'.
He had only gone to Berlin, however, because he had been picked
up by his 'sporting uncle'. 'One is always helped when one is young,'
he said disarmingly, 'because people always like you when you are
young.' He was 'what you call pretty' when he was young and had
'no trouble getting around and getting money'. He did not stay in
the working-class quarters of the Hallesches Tor, where Auden and
Isherwood frequented the male brothels and homosexual cafes, and
he would not meet Auden until thirty years later in Rome. He stayed
at the luxurious Adlon Hotel, where he remembered swans' necks
arching from the four corners of the trolley as
it was wheeled in for
breakfast. A photograph taken of him at the time, in the gardens of
Schloss Nymphenburg, shows him wearing a formal striped
suit, a
high
collar,
knotted
tie and
dark homburg
hat. He was
dressed
conventionally in an erotic gymnasium. Yet 'Bacon knew a Berlin
that was
laid out on
its back',
his
friend and
critic John Russell
wrote, 'and asked only to be pleasured over and over again'.
With his wealthy patron. Bacon did not visit The Cosy Corner,
but the high-class bars of the West End. 'Here, screaming boys in
drag and monocled Eton-cropped girls in dinner-jackets play-acted
the high jinks of Sodom and Gomorrah,' Isherwood wrote, 'horrify-

ing the onlookers and reassuring them that BerUn was
still the most
decadent
city
in Europe.' But there was no
threat of arrest, even
under paragraph
175
of the
Criminal
Code. The
Berlin
police
tolerated the places. *No customer risked arrest simply for being in
them. When the bars were raided, which didn't happen often,
it was
only the boys who were required to show their papers.' The famous
transvestite bar, the Eldorado, which Otto Dix painted in 1927, was
the
rage
of Berlin
society, and
the
Berliner Journal reported
the
guessing game of who was who and which sex was which: 'They
don't always guess right. The techniques of dressing up, doing one's
hair and make-up have achieved undreamed perfection.' Only when
his patron ran off with a woman after a week did Bacon see anything
of Berlin low
life. He remembered particularly the cafes where
a
client could
telephone
from
table
to
table
to
fix an anomTnous
rendez-vous.
In his most famous phrase from his Berlin Diary, Isherwood wrote,
*I am a camera with
its shutter open, quite passive, recording, not
thinking
.
.
. Some day,
all this will have to be developed, carefully
printed, fixed.' It was, through the young Bacon's recording eyes and
the images
of the
Expressionist and Weimar
artists. He
did
not
escape from the influence of Edvard Munch, whose woodcut and
painting, 'The
Cry', proved almost as
indelible
a memor\^
as
the
nurse crying out with her face bloodied and glasses shattered in the
Odessa Steps sequence of Eisenstein's film The Battleship Potankin,
which Bacon saw for the
first time. His very process of detached
assimilation was
that of the Neue Sachlichkeit, or New Objectivity
school of painting, which was led by Otto Dix and Christian Schad,
important in Bacon's early work and
in the whole work of Lucian
Freud, with
its meticulous depiction of ever\' wrinkle and
rib and
pubic hair on the* human body. One painting by Schad, his 'Woman
of Berlin' of 1928, eerily forecast Bacon's later use of Cubist shapes
around his portrait heads, as she looks forward from cones of lighting
that make an abstract halo of angels and thorns behind her.
To see the German art of the time was also to see violence. Two
years before Bacon reached
the German
capital,
the French
art
dealer and friend of Proust, Rene Gimpel, visited Berlin and wrote
in his diary that the modern
artist did not 'have to understand the

Prick in Some Flowers
49
whole past, since his art contains
it in
its entirety'. Rembrandt had
expressed
his
time:
reflective,
powerful,
rich.
Manet's
pictures
showed the absolute present. And as the French art dealer viewed
modern painting
in
Berlin, he saw the present-day
sensibility of
Germany and future
disaster.
'Furious, violent heads, drunk with
blood, murderous, demonic, and not in the ancient manner but the
modern: replete with the scientific, with poison gases.' The world of
hate was
a modern
invention,
laid
bare on
these
canvases,
the
paintings
in which the young Francis Bacon would
also begin to
discern the imagery which would make him the particular recorder
of the violence of his century. 'The demons in the Gothic pictures
are child's play beside these human, or rather these inhuman, heads
of a turbulent humanity, avid for devastation, which line the walls,
baring their black teeth, teeth of steel, eyes bordered by live coals,
blood-tinged
nostrils. They'll revel in cutting into living flesh, the
Germans of tomorrow!'
This was the
first modern art that Bacon saw when he went to
Berlin, although the work of the German Expressionists came to his
vision mainly through posters and illustrations in magazines. It would
inform his own later pictures. And photography, which was always to
fascinate
him,
was
informing
figurative
painting.
Otto
Dix and
Christian Schad were creating pictures that were almost clinically
accurate, cloaking a vision in technical perfection. 'Photography can
never
record more
than
a moment
(and
then
purely from
the
outside),' Dix once declared.
'It can never create forms which are
specific and personal, for this capacity depends on the artistic powers
and
intuition of the painter. And so
a hundred photographs of a
person would produce merely a hundred different momentary views,
but never the miracle of the totality.'
The year that Bacon stayed briefly in Berlin was the year that Dix
painted his masterpiece,
his triptych of 'Metropolis' - a form that
Bacon was
to use
in
his own
depictions of human violence and
corruption.
In Dix's
triptych, he appears himself as
a war cripple
hobbling into the German capital to meet a snarling dog and a row
of enticing prostitutes. The central panel shows a West End night-
club playing American jazz at full blast to lurid women of riches or
from the
streets. The musicians with
their thrusting instruments

50
Francis Bacon
dominate this dance of living death. The panel on the right portrays
prostitutes
in
a
row,
flaunting themselves
in
front of a Baroque
building, the rotten modern on parade in front of the irrelevant and
flamboyant
old, emphasised by a war cripple who gives an ironic
salute above the severed stumps of his legs.
George Grosz's scenes of Berlin
life were less detached, more a
vicious comment on the human degradation
inflicted by the
lost
World War and the following rampant inflation, a process which had
culminated in the hedonistic sexuality and exhibitionism of the late
'twenties. As one commentator
noted,
'By making
vice
safe
for
democracy, in the laudable effort to allow all and sundry pleasures
of the more
expensive kind
hitherto reserved
for gentlemen,
the
Weimar Republic focused the world's attention on Berlin as a city
not of dreadful, but of disgraceful,
night.' George Grosz's savage
line and images that bordered on caricature were moral invective, a
shock of awareness of the truth. In Ernst Toller's Brokenbrow,
his
drawings of Berlin street life complemented the excoriating speech
of the Showman, who explained what life was all about in the city of
sexual booths, which Bacon had seen.
You must see the War's back number now. Peepshow *the horrors
of the war' won't earn sixpence. Nowadays Progress
is the word.
Hundred per cent. All the rage. Full steam ahead and pat me on
the back. Look about you, man. Got
to make good nowadays.
Show your paces.
Spirit of the
age. Doesn't matter what
it
is:
boxing, politics, stock exchange, golf champion, copper king, movie
star, prophet, jockey, antisemite,
agitator, advertising man. Busi-
ness booming. Take time by the
forelock. No pitch so black
it
won't wash off Morality: free sample given away with every packet.
Grosz's brutal brush and pen were counterpointed by the spare and
harsh lyrics sung in the night-clubs which Bacon attended with his
Irish 'uncle'. There was one song which attacked the New Objectivity
and the triumph of the Machine Age.
Tomorrow they will build houses bare, wholly and utterly without
facades.
We are sick of trifling rubbish. Far too much is superfluous.

Get rid of the furniture in the flat. Get rid of anything out of place.
We declare without mercy, every person who happens to be there is in
the way.
This criticism of the New Objectivity and the Bauhaus design of
machine-made furniture, which was a factor in mass unemployment
among the crafts, was not lost on Francis Bacon. Curiously enough,
he
liked the Bauhaus
style and
in
his
early career as an
interior
decorator he would adopt many of
its
functional
principles. His
chairs of steel tube and leather would be very similar in style to the
current Bauhaus style of Marcel Breuer and the seat on which the
Toung Aesthete' is sitting in Karl Rossing's woodcut of 1929. Bacon
was
still shy and confined within many of his own repressions, and
the cool and detached New Objectivity of Berlin art and the Bauhaus
was attractive to him in his adolescence. He was too young and too
insecure
to achieve what Otto Dix had achieved
in the new
era,
when technology and photography were being incorporated into art.
Although Dix despised the age of the machine, he made himself
into a machine of precision. As one critic said, 'He records the un-
predictability, the diversity, the horrible violence and the grotesque
grandeur of human nature, things which are of no interest to the
objectively-minded businessman, engineer or surgeon. This is what
was meant by the difference between style and state of mind.' Francis
Bacon was introduced to the
style of the New Objectivity with
its
precision and
its detached recording of horror and violence. But as
yet he would only comprehend the outward clinical lines and objects,
not yet the defined technique for encapsulating all the fear and shock
and loathing of the mass murder of the First World War within a
formal framework.
Otto Dix had been
a machine-gunner
at
the
front, which he
depicted
in
the same
spirit of removed
detail
as he
did himself
following a tart upstairs in Brussels. Before the Nazis denounced his
degenerate art, he was twice prosecuted during the Weimar years for
pornography and lascivious imagery and sedition, and twice acquit-
ted, something which would not have happened
in contemporary
England. Over there, nudity and homosexuality were banned from
the cinema and the stage, in spite of an occasional performance of

52
Francis Bacon
plays such as J. R. Ackerley's The Prisoners of War, which starred
Raymond Massey in a drama which one critic noted was 'not one of
depression but of repression'. In BerUn, as Christopher Isherwood
saw at a costume ball, only for men and female impersonators, the
great
film
star Conrad
Veidt
sat
apart
in
tails. He had
already
appeared in two homosexual
films, Anders
als die Andem
{Dijferent
from the Others) in 19 19 and Gesetze der Liebe {Laws ofLave) in 1927.
Now he seemed
'a supernatural
figure, the guardian god of these
festivities, who was graciously manifesting himself to his devotees'.
This was the Berlin world of sexual liberty and new vision and
detached
style to which Francis Bacon was taken. He only stayed
there for three months before leaving for another louche and artistic
urban jungle in Paris, where he would learn the style of living as an
artist and a bohemian. Yet it was in Berlin that he first encountered
the gay and abandoned ways of the refugee Anglo-American writers
and
artists, who fled to Europe from the repressions of their own
countries, to enjoy the cabaret songs and nude dances of those whom
Dix painted, Anita Berber with her drug addiction and Use Bois,
who sang:
Without shame and without pang
I sleep with the whole gang.
Not just with a single gent.
No holds barred is the modem bent.
As Bacon recalled at the end of his
life, 'Berlin was a very violent
place - emotionally violent, not physically - and that certainly had its
effect on me.' He then denied the effect on his unconscious vision
which German Expressionism had had on him.
'I wasn't the slightest
bit interested irrart until about 1930.
I lived a very indolent Ufe.
I
was absolutely free.
I drifted for years.'
'If there be fuel prepared', the Lord Chancellor Bacon wrote,
'it is
hard to tell whence the spark shall come that will set it on fire.' The
young Francis Bacon never spoke much about the two years which

Prick in Some Flowers
53
he spent in Paris at the end of the 'twenties, nor about what he took
away from the
experience,
except
for an abiding love of France,
particularly its food and wine and speech. He arrived at the end of
October and on his nineteenth birthday he went to Montmartre in a
party with the leading Chanel model, Toto Koopman. He spent the
first three months of his stay living with a family in Chantilly to the
north of Paris, trying to learn the language. His great-grandmother
had been partially French, and he was conscious that the Paris of the
time exceeded even Berlin
as
a refuge
for British and American
artists on the run, as well as a stimulant for the avant-garde.
While he was
still staying at Chantilly and trying to exist on his
allowance of three pounds a week from his mother, Francis would
often visit the local Musee Conde. There he would stare at Poussin's
^Massacre of the Innocents'. Although the picture was celebrated at
the time
for
its control over disturbing images of violence. Bacon
was struck by 'probably the best human cry in painting'.
It seemed
to him then, with the victim before the massacre screaming mutely
with open mouth for an impossible mercy, and dilating two pairs of
eyelids to the size of begging lips, that this silent and useless protest
put in paint what was shown in black and white in Munch's woodcut
of *The Cry' and the images of revolt and yelling in the film of The
Battleship Potemkin. The latter played regularly in that cineaste city,
where the Surreal Cinema of Buiiuel would pluck out the images of
the subconscious and make them available to the mind's eye.
One
other inescapable
influence
in
the
Paris of the
time was
acknowledged by Francis Bacon.
It was
Picasso, whose show he
viewed at the Paul Rosenberg Gallery. That's when
I first thought
about painting,' he told his cousin Diana Watson. 'There were some
very decorative
still lives at that time which
I liked.' The awkward
and bulbous people in the Dinard bathing pictures, that floated by
the beach huts, also opened his eyes to the 'possibilities of painting'.
Although he did not meet either Picasso or his later friend Giacom-
etti at that time, as he did not move in their circles, he was conscious
of who they were and how artists lived their lives in Montparnasse.
As John
Russell
wrote,
he was
deeply
affected
by
the
Parisian
ambience, which largely came to an end with the financial crash of
1929. People were left alone to be themselves and life was improvis-

54
Francis Bacon
ation in an age of increasing standardisation. Also, Paris was cerebral
to him in the way that Berlin had been visceral.
Curiously enough, Bacon himself was studying furniture design
and interior decoration more than painting. The angular furniture of
Dufet and Breuer and
Pierre Chareau,
the
lighting marketed by
Damon
and
particularly Le
Corbusier's
chaise-longue
of
1928,
designed with Jeanneret and Perriand in hide and leather and steel,
all impressed him. So
did
the
asceptic white
architecture
of Le
Corbusier and Chareau, Mallet-Stevens in the Seizieme district and
Andre Lurgat, whose brother Jean's geonometrical designs for rugs
were
also
a profound
influence. More
than
the
style
of Lazlo
Moholy-Nagy from the Bauhaus, Le Corbusier and Jean Lurgat,
with
their clean
lines and
striking colours,
influenced the young
Bacon in Paris.
Yet
Picasso
dominated
the
city and was
to
possess
the
first
paintings of Francis Bacon. To his contemporaries, Picasso was a
demi-urge, the creator of his time. For Maurice Sachs, who wrote
The Decade ofIllusion^ about Paris in the 'twenties, Picasso rediscov-
ered painting as Chaplin discovered the cinema. In the world after
Freud was widely read, Picasso gave the abstract a concrete form.
He reaUsed dreams in Cubism and progressed from
it to an inner
realism. The unconscious flowed into the conscious to produce
a
visible
thing;
the
external appearance was
discarded
to show an
internal
truth. The discoveries of Freud, the Russian Revolution,
and Cubism - these gave the twentieth century unshakable founda-
tions for future building.
'I do not seek,' Picasso said,
*I find.' This
is exactly what Bacon would do in his major works, which found in
flayed figures wrenched from the guts, and in screaming popes, the
internal truths of his century.
In another wa5^, Picasso's technique informed Bacon: his use of
chance to reach the final result. Jean Cocteau told of him designing
the stage-set ior Antigone. Picasso had painted masks, which Cocteau
had hung, but they wondered what to do with a white panel below,
*how
to
indicate on
this
surface
the meaning of a chance
decor\
Picasso rubbed a stick of red chalk over the uneven wood, which
then looked like marble. With a bottle of ink, he traced designs and
blackened a few spaces and three columns appeared so instanta-

Prick in Some Flowers
55
neously that the watchers burst into applause. Picasso admitted to
Cocteau that he had been surprised himself at their sudden appear-
ance, but that *one always calculates without realising it'. It was to be
the method of Francis Bacon in his
art, the use of rough surfaces
and chance brush
strokes
to achieve the
calculations he had not
anticipated.
It was also the method of the French bohemian poets
whom he admired - Baudelaire, Verlaine and Rimbaud - to fix the
vertigos,
to pursue
the
rational unreason of the
senses.
Nadar's
famous photograph of Baudelaire would be pinned in pride of place
beside clippings of Himmler and Goebbels from Picture Post, and a
reproduction of Velasquez's painting of Pope Innocent X, in Bacon's
later London studio.
One
stage-set and
artist
that did
appear
to
influence
Francis
Bacon in one of the
first paintings that he was to
sell, was Andre
Masson's Surreal design for the Russian Ballet oi Les Presages. The
stick-like limbs of a luminous and fantastic insect were superimposed
by Bacon onto a Crucifixion. As he was to say later, he wanted his
pictures to look as if a human being had passed between them like a
snail, leaving a trail of slime. The Surrealists believed in the vision
of
instinct,
the
choice
of the
unconscious. The
mentor
of the
movement, Andre Breton,
in his Surrealism and Painting of 1928,
declared that 'the eye exists in a savage state.' The artist should view
the world without the blinkers of convention with untamed vision
and liberty to pick and discard at will. The painter should refer to
interior landscapes and the inner eye. The artist's drive was for his
own emancipation beyond painting. And for inspiration, he should
depend
on
the
objet
trouve,
the
random
thing
or
postcard
or
photograph, which was made into a work of art itself by the artist's
choice of it. Bacon always remembered his ambles along the quais
among the booksellers from whom he bought a second-hand medical
manual with beautiful hand-coloured plates of diseases of the mouth.
These obsessed him as much as the screams in Poussin's painting
and the film of The Battleship Potemkin, and he would paint studies
of false teeth for months on his return to London. As a later critic of
his early painting was to surmise, the
first twenty years of Bacon's
career
as an
artist was an attempt
to
resolve and
assimilate
the

56
Francis Bacon
difference between the New Objectivity of Berlin and the Surrealism
of Paris.
Although Bacon had
left Berlin before
the
street violence had
initiated the collapse of the Weimar Republic, he was in Paris when
the economic crash of 1929 heralded the decline of the Decade of
Illusion. He saw enough of the
artists'
life
in Montparnasse,
that
swirled round The Dome and The Rotonde, The Select and The
Coupole, to know that he would like to lead
it when he could afford
it: a daily meeting with friends after work in the studio to drink the
night away. In 1929, Alice Prin, the model and singer who was the
acknowledged Queen of Montparnasse under the name of 'Kiki',
wrote her memoirs at the age of twenty-eight as a valedictory to that
style of life, which the refugee American writers and
artists were
already deserting after the Great Crash of Wall Street.
'Montparnasse, so picturesque, so colourfuP, she wrote. 'AH the
people of the earth pitched their tents here like one big family. In
the morning you can see young fellows in wide trousers and fresh-
cheeked young girls hurrying to the academies: Watteau, Colarossi,
Grande Chaumiere
.
.
. Later the
terrasses of the cafes
fill up, the
porridge of the pretty Americans
sits side by side with the French
lemon-pickers. One looks for a ray of sunlight at The Dome, at The
Select. The models meet each other there. They are true to their
trade: Aicha, Bouboule, Clara
.
.
.' And
herself. And Hemingway
corroborated her view of Montparnasse. The difference between the
workers and the visiting bums was that the
latter appeared
at the
cafes before noon. 'The worker goes to the cafe with the lonesome-
ness that a writer or painter has after he has worked all day and does
not want to think about
it until the next day but instead see people
and talk about anything that
is not serious and drink a
little before
supper. And maybe during and after supper too.'
Kiki particularly modelled for Man Ray, when he gave up painting
for photography and became her lover. 'His stare is lost in pieces of
crystal -
in imagination -
or dreaming about new photographic
devices.' He and her other
artist patrons, Foujita and Derain and
Desnos and Kisling and Pascin, were the friends who had made the
reputation of Montparnasse - then the art dealers had sustained
it.
'To make
a long
story
short, Montparnasse
is
a village
that's
as

Prick in Some Flowers
57
round as a circus. You get into
it and you don't know just how, but
getting out of it again is not so easy.'
Francis Bacon, at the age of eighteen and nineteen, was too shy to
get into the life of Montparnasse, but he did observe
it. His sense of
isolation was only increased by taking in the easy intimacy of the
artistic
coteries. He did
learn, however, from Man Ray and Max
Ernst, of the importance of the photograph to the painter: both of
them took to the camera as a reHef from the palette. Even Leger had
been a photographic retoucher to earn a living and had done photo
montage.
In
1927,
the pioneer of French photography had
died,
Eugene Atget. His documentation over fifty years of street Ufe had
been of 'beggars, hand-organ players, shop-fronts of literally all the
metiers, horses, women's hats, shoes, fashions in
fish,
in civic and
military
uniform'. The
plates had been
saved and were put on
exhibition by an American photographer and commemorated by the
ubiquitous American reporter of Paris, Janet Flanner, who wrote her
fortnighdy 'Letter from Paris' to The New Yorker, under the name of
Genet. She claimed that Atget was the
first to show the beauty of
the empty
street,
although
Utrillo made
it
fashionable and used
Atget's photographs to paint his canvases - complaining of their lack
of perspective. That use of photographs was to be a technique of
Francis Bacon's.
Another remarkable photographer,
Brassa'i, who was called
'the
eye of Paris' by his friend and fellow night-stroller Henry Miller,
examined and published the images of the hidden world of Paris. He
would go, with his camera,
to the brothels, gay balls and criminal
bars of the city, take one picture, and toss the camera to an assistant,
who would run for it while he stayed to be beaten up. His account of
the 'Magic City' showed its attraction to Francis Bacon.
It was there
that he
first met the liberated members of an international
set of
patrons, who would finance him to begin his career as an interior
decorator.
As
BrassaT
described
them,
they
were
Proustian
characters:
The Baron de Charlus and
the
tailor Jupien,
every Albert and
Andre
metamorphosed
for
this
great
night
into
Andree
and
Albertine
.
.
.

58
Francis Bacon
They arrived in small groups, after having emptied the closets of
the
fairer
sex:
dresses and
corsets,
hats,
lingerie, wigs,
jewelry,
necklaces, mascara, creams and perfumes
.
.
. Everyone wore
silk
flowers, garlands, ropes of pearls, feathers, trinkets ... Of course
most of them were in dressmaking, lacemaking, furs, hairdressing
- creators of hats, ribbons, embroidery, fabrics, laces
.
.
. Almost
all of them had devoted their lives to dressing, beautifying, deifying
women, making them seductive and attractive for others to love -
for they certainly didn't.
Every
entrance
and
every
costume
gave
rise
to
shrieks
of
surprise,
cries
of astonishment,
of
joy. They
embraced,
they
showered each other with compliments, they admired and kissed.
They camped and teased each other with squeals of delight. An
immense, warm, impulsive fraternity. There were monstrous cou-
ples,
grotesque
couples, some were
surprising and even
heart-
warming. Two young men wrapped in each other's arms had - to
demonstrate the perfect union of their souls, their bodies - dressed
in
a
single
suit: one was wearing the
jacket, with
his
legs and
buttocks naked; the other wore the pants, his torso and feet bare,
since he had given his boyfriend the only pair of shoes.
Most of the couples were less well matched, however. Mature
men accompanied by youths in drag were the rule
.
.
. And
I saw
many
enigmatic,
unidentifiable
creatures,
floating between
the
poorly drawn barrier between the sexes in a sort of no man's land.
There were long,
fragile necks, smooth doll-like faces, peaches-
and-cream complexions, platinum hair set off by a cameUia or a
red carnation
.
.
.
There was no ban on homosexuality in France, and the poHce
were
fairly tolerant toward
'special' night clubs. So long as the
customers maintained
a minimum of decent behaviour and the
management kept out minors and prohibited overly blatant cruis-
ing, the police left such places alone. However, though women had
always been allowed to dance together, men doing so was one of
the forbidden pleasures. It's odd that in French Hterature, Sapphic
love has always been allowed a certain dispensation, whereas up
until Gide and Proust, there was a ban on love between men.
Later
talking
to Grey Gowrie,
Francis Bacon
said
that he
liked
Proust and the beginning of *Cities of the Plain' said all that needed
to be said about being homosexual. Bacon was
still trying to escape
his attraction for the father he disliked, but he had not yet found a

Prick in Some Flowers
5 9
father in another man. He told Gowrie that Picasso and Yeats were
the great artists of the century, and revealed that France had given
him his taste for fine
claret. Taking Francis out was,
financially,'
Gowrie wrote,
'like buying one of his paintings. He could be polite
about anything other than Petrus, Mouton, Cheval Blanc, Margaux,
Lafite, but only
just.' As an older man, he worked on 'an almost
Proustian sequence of paintings' about his own
life, but he did not
complete
it, as he considered that painting and sculpture were more
limited than writing and the film.
Before he
returned
to London from
Paris
in
1930,
however,
Francis Bacon recorded
in
his mind's
eye
the most
sensational
images of the cinema of his time, those created by Louis Bunuel in
Un Chien Andalou and L'Age dVr. The second film created a public
outrage when it was shown in the year of Bacon's departure. Already
Eisenstein's film. The General Line^ had been banned by the Board
of Censors, although The Battleship Potemkin was not. A new bigotry
seemed to be born. A Surrealist Manifesto accompanied L'Age d'Or,
signed by Aragon and Breton, Dali and Tzara, with drawings by
Max Ernst and Miro, Man Ray and Tanguy. Its message would have
pleased the young rebel in Bacon:
It
is Lave which brings about the
transition from permission to
action; Love, denounced in the bourgeois demonology as the root
of all
evil. For Love demands the sacrifice of every other value:
status, family and honour. And the failure of Love within the social
framework leads to Revolt ... In this age of so-called prosperity,
the social function of L 'Age dVr must be to urge the oppressed to
satisfy their hunger for destruction and perhaps even to cater for
the masochism of the oppressor.
It was certainly homosexual love which had taken Francis Bacon to
Berlin and
Paris,
and had made him
reject
the
bourgeois
and
conventional life of his parents in Ireland and England. The images
which he was to carry away from the European capitals of Germany
and France were those of violence and protest and destruction, the
cry and the carcass,the scream and the anger. In Bunuel's first film,
Un Chien Andalou, the opening images showed the director himself
sharpening a razor to cut open the eyeball of a young woman. Matter

6o
Francis Bacon
ran out of the
sliced
eyeball
into
its lower
lid.
Later,
the young
woman poked in the gutter with a walking-stick at a severed hand,
while
ants crawled out of a wound
in the palm of another hand
crushed in a door. But most haunting for the young artist, who was
becoming anti-religious and had observed as closely as Soutine the
bloody meat hanging from the hooks in the butchers' shops of Paris,
was the sequence of the young lover dragging behind him a grand
piano with a dead and gashed donkey lying on top, over the keyboard,
and a couple of live priests: a savage eye commenting on music and
the flesh and the faith. Although Bacon's early paintings were not to
be accepted for the International Surrealist Exhibition in London in
June,
1936,
the
violence
of BuiiuePs
pictures
of passion
and
destruction would trouble him all his life.
However attractive and relatively cheap life was in Paris, Francis
Bacon found
that he could
not make
a
living there. With some
knowledge of modern
interior decoration and an inner vision of
extreme urban images, he returned to London to earn money and
find
a patron and
a
father
figure.
Later he claimed
that he had
carried out commissions in design in Berlin and Paris. The truth is
that these were the
streets of his visual education. In spite of the
criminality of homosexuality in London, the young artist would find
there what he sought, a mentor and a marginal way of existence. He
would prick in some flowers of that he had learned abroad.

The Chair and the Crucifixion
Love is ever matter of comedies, and now and then of
tragedies: but in life
it doth much mischief; sometimes Hke a
siren, sometimes Hke a fury.
'Of Love'
by Francis Bacon, Lord Verulam,
Viscount St. Albans
Francis Bacon was conscious that he had lived all the distorted years
of the 'thirties. He had always existed through forms of violence. But
the violence of life was very different from the violence in painting.
'When talking about the violence of paint, it's nothing to do with the
violence of war.' It had to do with 'an attempt to remake the violence
of reality itself.
The mentor whom Francis met on
his
return
to London had
actually worked
on
colour
combinations
which
might
help
the
deranged victims of war to achieve some peace of mind. Roy de
Maistre had escaped from a background of horse-breeding and a
lack of early formal education as had his young protege. Brought up
on an Australian ranch by his patriarchal and wealthy father and
adoring mother, Roy was the ninth child and
sixth son of a large
family. He had always been the sole artistic odd one out, and he was
remembered as a prissy little boy who always wore a bow-tie at play
and wheeled his pram of dolls through the paddocks. He was allowed
to take up the study of music and
art. Unable to serve long in the
Australian Army during the War because of weakness and debility,
he invented patterns of sky-blue and primrose and dark green floors

62
Francis Bacon
to put shell-shocked soldiers in Red Cross Nerve Hospitals to sleep.
He progressed from a psychiatry of colour to a melody of colour, in
which the seven shades of the rainbow were laid against the notes of
the
scale. These correspondences of hues and tones were used to
decorate the wards of the Nerve Hospitals and were later developed
by Roy de Maistre
into his schemes of interior decoration and
a
patented Colour Harmonising Disc to
facilitate the work of artists
and designers.
He sailed to Europe, to Montparnasse in Paris and to Kensington
in London, where he met the young Bacon. They moved
into
a
converted garage in 7 Queensberry Mews West in South Kensing-
ton, where Bacon had already held his first design show of furniture
and rugs. In a second joint show, in the November of 1929, Bacon's
tentative watercolours and gouaches hung alongside de Maistre's
oils and circular wall mirrors of clear and opaque glass, while painted
screens were
set on polished wooden floorboards with ruches of
rubber sheeting suspended over the windows. Later he would admit
that his furniture was
totally influenced by Le Corbusier, and he
would say,
*I loathe my own furniture.
I think
it absolutely horrible
...
I never want to see it again.'
Roy de Maistre was unprepossessing, but highly seductive. Two
of his influential friends, the art historian and Director of the Tate
Gallery - John Rothenstein - and the novelist Patrick White, have
left testimonies
to
his powers of attraction. At
this
time, he was
plump and balding, small and diabetic. Despite his social graces and
exposure to French culture, he remained stubbornly Australian. He
seemed to Rothenstein a reticent and deeply civilised painter with an
advanced
personality,
aggressive
to
the
point
of harshness.
His
attitude was contradicted by his appearance. He looked neat, Edwar-
dian and
fastidious:
he had
urbane
manners;
in
his
hallway,
a
collapsible opera-hat lay beside a Roman Catholic missal and pieces
of antique
French
porcelain.
'Roy's
studio was
a work
of
art,'
Rothenstein wrote of his friend, 'and, like Courbet's, a repertory of
his whole Hfe.' He chose to cultivate friendships rather than social
relations which might be casual or fortuitous. Although he believed
in being gentie and forbearing in
life, the conduct of art was quite
different.
'It
is often necessary, for instance,' he told Rothenstein,

The Chair and the Crucifixion
63
'to give the spectator an ugly left uppercut.' When Patrick White met
de
Maistre
in
1936 because he had been
told by
old
ladies
in
Australia that the artist used to trim hats, he found him melancholy
and snobbish with loyal friends, somebody who dressed like a bank
manager and worked
in an embroidered smock. But
like Francis
Bacon before him, White was looking for a father and a mentor, an
elder man who
'held a sort of secret knowledge of the
details of
living that was very important to me'.
The details of living and the introductions to patrons of the arts
were
the
contribution of Roy de
Maistre, whom
Francis Bacon
revered as he could not his father. Both of them had a patriarchal
and horse-mad male parent and a fond mother; but Roy also had the
gift of attracting wealthy men and women and art critics, something
which the shy Francis, at twenty years of age,
still had to learn. He
did not really know yet that he even wanted to be a painter. He was
a late starter in everything. He had become an interior decorator and
designer because of the influence that Berlin and Paris had on him.
He said that the analytic side of his brain did not develop until he
was nearly thirty years old. Only then could he begin to open out.
The truth was that his emancipation did not begin
until his true
father was to die in 1940. Until then, he would look for and find two
other fathers and teachers and patrons, Roy de Maistre and after-
wards Eric Hall, an intelligent and sensitive civil servant.
De Maistre provided Bacon with enough money to manufacture
more rugs and furniture. His major patron would be met through an
admirer of de Maistre, Samuel Courtauld, a formidable collector of
post-Impressionist
art, whose daughter was married
to the
rising
Conservative
politician and
future
Under-Secretary
of State
for
Foreign Affairs, R. A. Buder. Buder commissioned from Bacon a
glass and metal dining-table and
a
set of stools
for
his house
in
Smith Square. Malcolm Sargent never liked the transparent table,
because he could not 'play footsie -footsie' under
it; but both Bacon
and de Maistre became family friends of the Buders. Their furniture
was later to be bought by Patrick White and sold again to disappear
in time; but its style can be deduced from a photograph and a note
on Bacon's work in Studio magazine in 1930 on the 'Look in British
Decoration'. Tubular steel and chromium plate stools with arched

64
Francis Bacon
rests and spotted hide seats are depicted, with round glass table-tops
set on white-painted steel frames, and a circular and an oval mirror
hung over a dressing-table made from wooden blocks and cubes.
Rugs in square and oblong and angular shapes
lie on the floor or
hang on the walls. There
is a cocktail bracket of steel and glass - a
device to save space. The colours are beige and grey, pink and black
and
white. The
style
is
highly
derivative
of
the
Bauhaus
and
contemporary French design, particularly that of Lurqat and Jean-
neret and Le Corbusier. All is spare and cornered and spartan, the
imitative inhibition on display of a shy young artist raging to break
out. As Studio wrote,
the
inspiration
for
his pieces
'springs from
nothing Oriental or traditional - they are purely thought forms'.
The
early Bacon
paintings
which were
seen
by
Rothenstein
showed the predominant influence of Picasso, also of the mechanism
of Leger and the Surrealism of Max Ernst. Roy de Maistre painted
Bacon's studio in 1934, when he had moved to 71 Royal Hospital
Road in Chelsea. Against bare boards and angular white surfaces,
canvases are stacked, two turned towards the painter's brush, one of
a skeletal and feathered bird, another of the quartered oudine of a
horse
or
dragon -
the
start
of
a movement
from
geonometric
abstraction towards a more organic image. But these are works of
transition, those of an embryo trying to flesh itself. Teople - when
you are young - influence you a great deal,' Bacon later admitted.
' - perhaps
I was in love.' Certainly de Maistre recorded the change
of his protege from interior decorator to painter, his furniture
left
behind him.
The problem of the exhibition in Queensberry Mews was that the
Cubist
furniture and
rugs of Francis Bacon
appealed, while
the
paintings of Roy de Maistre did not. The Crucifixion and the Pietd
were very much tKe subjects of the elder painter, who was a convert
to Catholicism; and in their austere and fractured angularity, they
were an example
to the young Bacon. De Maistre made
a
living
chiefly on his portraits and
still
lives and flower paintings, which
appealed to his circle of elderly women friends, such as the Princess
Galatzine. But these were not the principles of painting which he
taught to Francis, his young lover. He found him ignorant of almost
everything. He
told Rothenstein
that Bacon had
only scrutinised

The Chair and the Crucifixion
65
reproductions, knew notiiing whatever about the techniques of art
and had hardly drawn at all. The Crucifixion paintings by Cimabue
and Griinewald
in reproduction had
particularly
affected him.
It
was amusing that a young man of such rare intelligence, who had
understood the Picasso exhibition in Paris, should 'ask questions a
schoolchild might have answered'. This tentative start led to Bacon
painting his 'diluted Picassos', a style in which he was not to persist,
and 'dead pale
trees
in landscape'. There were
also watercolours
and
gouaches
of temples and
columns,
that evoked
Giorgio
de
Chirico and the Surreal scenes of Paul Nash. But for Francis Bacon
this was a dead end.
The first exhibition of Bacon and de Maistre in their Kensington
garage was sufficiendy successful for the fledgling Cork Street gallery
of Freddie Mayor, a convinced advocate of modern art, to offer them
another show in April 1933, in an exhibition of recent paintings by
English,
French and German
artists. Bacon showed
a
painting,
'Women
in the
Sunlight', which has now disappeared, but which
provoked Time and Tide to call
it 'a
littie tiny piece of red mouse-
cheese on the end of a stick for a head' and Harper's Bazaar 'a glass
of champagne which denotes
a woman'. The
earUest of Francis
Bacon's paintings
to survive was also shown there,
a portrait of a
man with full lips and close-set eyes and diseased appearance. It was
bought by his second cousin and close friend, Diana Watson, who
confirmed to Rothenstein that Francis had never from his childhood
spoken of becoming a painter until after the Picasso exhibition he
had seen in Paris. She was rich by inheritance, but she remained
single. She had an affinity with her relative Francis, who was hardly
more interested in marriage than she was.
Yet the second most influential critic after the doyen of Blooms-
bury, Roger Fry, was Herbert Read, and he included a Crucifixion
painted by Francis Bacon in his influential Art Now: An Introduction
to
the
Theory
of Modem Painting and Sculpture of 1933.
Bacon's
Crucifixion was shown without commentary after works by Henry
Moore and Zadkine and Kirschner and Picasso. Later, a painting by
de Maistre was reproduced of a phallic shape seen as the top of a
tower penetrating vague buttocks and ending in a lighthouse balcony.
Mayor now
put on
a show
of the
artists
featured m Art Now,

66
Francis Bacon
including Bacon, and Sir Michael Sadler bought his Crucifixion by
telegram
because
of the
reproduction
in
the
book.
It was
the
ectoplasmic and etiolated spectre derived from the Surrealist work
of Masson and
Ernst.
Sadler was
then
the
leading
collector
of
contemporary art, and he purchased two further Crucifixions from
Bacon. The second was set behind the bars of a prison while a figure
with imploring feet put the lance into the Saviour's side on the Cross
like the Roman centurion Saint Longinus. The
third Crucifixion
depicted
a warped and
angular being
starting forward from
his
swept-back and pinioned arms. To this picture, Bacon had added an
impression of an X-ray, which Sadler had sent him of his own skull.
In his method of mocking the hand which fed him. Bacon added
fleshy pink
lips
to
the
transparent
skull,
riddled with
nerves,
as
though greed prefigured thought, the body came before the mind.
These three Crucifixions, each in an isolated space, prophesied the
triptych. Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion',
which would make Bacon's reputation eleven years later at the end
of the Second World War. Another picture of the dead and bandaged
body of Christ laid on a table, was destroyed by the artist.
At this second Mayor Gallery exhibition, which also showed four
carvings by Henry Moore and works by Picasso and Masson and
Ernst and Arp and Klee, success went to de Maistre as well as to his
protege. He was taken up by one of the proprietors of the
gallery,
another Australian expatriate, Douglas Cooper, gay and bitchy and
wealthy from the proceeds of a useful Sheep Dip. He converted the
family fortune into one of the finer collections of Cubist works in the
world, particularly those of Picasso and Braque, Oris and Leger. At
this time. Cooper signed his articles on art under the pseudonym of
Douglas Lord,
a homage
to Lord Alfred Douglas,
the
friend of
Oscar Wilde. His'^house, at 8 Groom Place, was decorated for a time
by the furniture designed by Francis Bacon, which Cooper was later
to use with cruel effect against the artist, when the two of them fell
out. He was
a
great
connoisseur,
but
jealous,
competitive
and
vindictive, although he remained friends with de Maistre and Patrick
White, who found him 4oyal once he takes to you'.
The patronage of Sadler and de Maistre and the Buders and now
Douglas Cooper was
the
introduction
of Francis
Bacon
into
a

The Chair and the Crucifixion
67
monied world which,
especially
in
the
Great Depression,
could
afford
to buy what he designed or painted. He was introduced to
fine and discriminating minds. He was learning the techniques and
tricks
of a new
trade. And
his
homosexuality was no
longer
a
hindrance, but a help. In his important book on the
'thirties, Julian
Symons called the period the homosexual decade. In those years, the
practice became accepted as a personal idiosyncrasy as well as a sort
of password to success in the arts. With the demand for unlimited
personal liberty, there was a conscious revolt against the standards
of society. What the EngUsh expatriate writers had experienced in
Weimar
Berlin
before
they
ran
from
the
rise
of Fascism was
transferred
to
Fitzrovia and Hampstead
in London. The unique
contribution made by the intelligentsia in the 'thirties to the change
in our sexual ethic rested in the attitude they adopted, by which the
assertion of sexual freedom appeared to be a social duty
.
.
. Every
illicit sexual act seemed a blow struck in aid of an ideal theoretical
freedom.'
Patrick White clearly expressed the feelings of the shy artists of
his persuasion; he blamed his sense of isolation and self-pity on his
homosexual temperament.
[It was] forced at that period anyway to surround itselfwith secrecy,
rather than on the instinctive need to protect my creative core from
intrusion and abuse.
The
repression
society
demands
of homosexuals
obviously
reduces them to some extent as members of that society, but if we
can quench our fears the perception gained through our tempera-
ment strengthens our hand
as man, woman,
artist, whichever
it
may be - or all in one. Homosexual society as such has never had
much appeal for me. Those who discuss the homosexual condition
with endless hysterical delight as though
it had not existed, except
in theory, before they discovered their own, have always struck me
as colossal bores. So
I avoid them, and no doubt
I am branded as
a closet queen.
I see myself not so much a homosexual as a mind
possessed by the spirit of man or woman ...
I don't set myself up
as an intellectual. What drives me is sensual, emotional, instinctive.
At the same time
I like to think creative reason reins me in as
I
reach the edge of disaster.

68
Francis Bacon
He might have been writing for the feeUngs of Francis Bacon, whose
affections he was to inherit from the gentlemanly de Maistre through
whom White and Bacon met.
It was a common feeling among those
who had escaped a moralistic and moral childhood, as
all three of
those artists had done. All of them had also had strong fathers and
remembered the attractions of the khaki and male presences of the
First World War. In his analysis of British writers of the
'thirties,
Valentine Cunningham found that homosexual
life
in that decade
did have a way of turning into a curiously welcomed parody of that
conflict. For E. M.
Forster, anyone
in
a uniform would
do, bus
conductors and train-drivers and especially policemen. 'Homosex-
uality being illegal, to consort sexually with a policeman was to be
engaged dangerously and
literally with the enemy, and an enemy
never
entirely
pacified
even
within
the
close-knit bonds
of the
uniformed lovers' world
.
.
. The whole thing was as enticingly risky
in
fact
as having
a German boyfriend was outrageous
to decent
British
opinion.' That was the choice of those who had gone
to
Berlin,
such
as
Spender, Auden,
Isherwood and
the
adolescent
Bacon, 'the boyfriend defiantly sought among the recent wartime foe
... A period controlled by memories, fantasies, the language of the
War,
the
'thirties
is commanded
obsessively by
a violence -
its
images,
its tone,
its horrors,
its pleasures - that one wants to keep
tracing back to the First World War.'
Yet
Francis Bacon
did
not turn
to
the
images
of war
in
his
paintings
of that
time. He
took up
de
Maistre's theme
of the
Crucifixion, of a man or God suffering for
all men. Although the
young artist was turning away from religion in spite of de Maistre's
convictions, he still saw in the martyrdom of Christ his own suffering
from his secret sexuality and his poverty. He would deny later any
religious impulse In his paintings, saying that he was merely fasci-
nated by the human body raised on high. Its elevation made
it more
formal and abstract. But he had his own reasons to paint as he did -
de
Maistre's teaching and
his
rebellion from
his own education.
Curiously enough, the illustration of Bacon's Crucifixion became the
most thumbed page in Graham Sutherland's copy o{ Art Now, and
he became an admirer of his fellow artist.
Yet as Bacon tasted early success, he would
fail and be unable to

The Chair and the Crucifixion
69
bear this failure. The following year, he arranged for an exhibition
of seven oils and six gouaches in the Transition Gallery, a name he
gave to the basement of Sunderland House in Curzon Street, which
had been taken for him by his friend, the art patron Arundell Clarke.
Although he repudiated and later destroyed all the works except for
two which were put on show there, he recalled one of them with
regret to John Russell.
It was named 'Wound for a Crucifixion' and
was set in a hospital ward like those which his lover de Maistre had
decorated, with the same dark green of the floors painted to waist-
height, with
a
dark
line
dividing
the
picture
to
a cream
above.
Presented forward was
a large piece of human
flesh and
'a very
beautiful wound'. It was a portent, suffering flesh inside an enclosure
pushed to its limit within the frame of the picture.
The show in Sunderland House was poorly attended in the depths
of the Depression and no pictures were sold. The Times wondered
about
the
difficulty
of the
paintings, whether
they were
artistic
expressions or
*the mere unloading on canvas and paper of what
used to be called the subconscious mind'. Bacon now hung up his
brushes and painted little else for a decade. Of the fifteen surviving
early Bacon
pictures,
all but one were
collected by
Sir Michael
Sadler and Diana Watson and Eric Alden, a friend and supporter.
Later Bacon said he didn't want to paint much, he preferred to enjoy
himself. He was growing apart from de Maistre, who now had
a
studio in Ebury Street which looked like a white ship's cabin with
minimal
furniture. De Maistre would soon be presented by
the
Butiers with the lease of an adjoining house in 13 Eccleston Street,
where he set up a studio
at the back of what had formerly been a
restaurant on
the ground
floor. Bacon took up
a vagrant and
a
rootless existence, becoming a bohemian in his clothes and style of
life, perhaps as a reaction from the precious de Maistre. He lived on
his wits, renting a series of studios in the Fulham and the Cromwell
Roads and then at
i Glebe Place in Chelsea, where he painted on
the top floor. He admitted to stealing from his father whenever he
could, and to leaving his rooms and studios without paying the rent.
'In those days,
I managed to get by on petty theft and on living off
people.' He was
to be
caught
shoplifting
in
his
favourite
store,
Harrod's, which he was to adore for the hanging, bloody carcasses

70
Francis Bacon
in
its butcher's shop. However rich he might grow to be, he was
never
to be
allowed an account
at Harrod's. But
his crime was
committed
in his young days. His virtue was
to increase with his
means and his generosity. In his early years, he had believed with
many artists, both socialists and anarchists, that property was theft.
That did not mean, of course, that theft was necessarily property, as
Harrod's had to caution him. But he was to return to favour when
he
could
afford
their
prices
and
his
morality,
giving
the
great
emporium his infinite custom.
Occasional commissions for making furniture continued to come
in. A yellow sofa of his stood in pride of place in Roy de Maistre's
living-room, backed by a screen which Bacon had painted. There he
was
to meet Patrick White, who was
to become the
lover of the
ageing painter. For these two young artists, de Maistre was tutor.
When White was introduced to abstract painting, he began 'to write
from the inside out ...
it was like jumping into space, and finding
nothing there at first
.
.
. Then gradually one saw
it was possible to
weave about freely on different levels, at one and the same time.' De
Maistre was also an entry to the social and artistic world of London.
He
had
a
talent
for
important
friendships,
White's
biographer
explained. 'His circle included poets and
critics, musicians,
politi-
cians and royalty. In country houses, he was thought "great fun, and
like Creevey was always a most welcome guest". He never travelled
without letters of introduction.'
White's
affair with de Maistre was not to
last long. De Maistre
told him that he was 'trying to recover from something unhappy', but
that he was twenty years older than White, so the relationship could
not work. He was also fifteen years older than Francis Bacon, who
remained friendly with him, but was already moving toward a love
affair with the civil servant, Eric Hall, who was as reticent as he was,
but so sympathetic towards the arts that he was to become the young
artist's new counsellor and adviser. Like Bacon, Patrick White always
remained the friend of de Maistre, who had the extraordinary talent
of converting his seductions into amity, his passions into fatherliness.
'We were both too irritable and unyielding,' White said of his affair
and took the guilt of the collapse upon himself by admitting that he
was hoping consciously to consummate his stifled love for his father.

The Chair and the Crucifixion
7

who was everything that de Maistre was not. *My failure depressed
me as much as my failure to communicate with my actual father.'
Bacon had also seen in his love of the older painter a stifled love
for his
father, who was everything that his lover was
not. Yet he
became friendly with his supplanter, the writer from Australia, who
was allowed by de Maistre to meet other English
artists including
Henry Moore and Graham Sutherland. Otherwise de Maistre lived
his life in watertight compartments, particularly his homosexual one.
White was offered the two top floors of 13 Eccleston Street to rent
as a flat. He shuddered at the cost, but accepted. He wanted modern
furniture
and
asked
Francis
Bacon
to
make
it
for
him.
One
magnificent desk was designed with wide, shallow, wooden drawers
and a top of red linoleum. The rest of the furniture was bought from
R. A. Butler, who found that the modern Baconian style of glass and
steel and hide was too much for his politician's dining-room at Smith
Street. Perhaps the negotiations at Munich with Hider and Cham-
berlain did not quite suit designs derived from the Bauhaus and the
Weimar Republic.
Once they had established a friendly distance from de Maistre,
White and Bacon learned to appreciate one another. As a novelist of
genius, White gave the
first revealing portrait in words of Francis
Bacon:
I got to know Francis when he designed some furniture
for my
Eccleston Street flat.
I like to remember his beautiful pansy-shaped
face, sometimes with too much lipstick on
it. He opened my eyes
to a thing or two. One afternoon
at Battersea, crossing the river
together by a temporary footbridge while the permanent structure
was under
repair, he became entranced by the
abstract
graffiti
scribbled in pencil on
its timbered sides. Alone,
I don't expect
I
would have noticed the effortless convolutions of line he pointed
out for me to admire. To discover something as subtle as
it was
simple made me feel quite elated. In those days Francis was living
at the end of Ebury
Street,
across
the
Pimlico Road, within
a
stone's throw of the Mozart- Sackville
brothel. He had
an
old
nanny who used to go out shoplifting whenever they were hard up,
and as lover there was an alderman.

72
Francis Bacon
What White particularly noticed in Bacon and de Maistre was their
mutual love of the snapshot and the newsreel. Their odd passion 'for
newspaper photographs was one
that White came
to
share. Each
collected them; the painters took them as starting points for abstract
exercises
...
for these
figures exposed so incongruously to public
scrutiny.' Bacon now scrutinised the March of Time and the available
newsreels which displayed the Fascist monsters of Europe, Mussolini
and Hitier and their cohorts. At one time, Bacon bought a Sickert
painting of a woman leaning on a bed and of a man
sitting on a
chest, taken from a photograph as the Edwardian artist often used to
do. Bacon
also studied Eadweard Muybridge's pioneering photo-
graphic
Victorian volumes
of The Human
Figure
in Motion
and
Animals in Motion. Victorian painters had subscribed to Muybridge's
volumes:
in
England, Watts and Holman Hunt and
Millais and
Whistler and Sargent; in France, Bougereau and Rodin. There, his
rival, Etienne-Jules Marey, had produced more beautiful images of
motion, but these influenced Bacon less. He found Muybridge more
stimulating because of his Vaw statements of movement'.
Bacon had to study Muybridge's volumes in the nearby Victoria
and Albert Museum before he could afford to buy reproductions of
them.
In
these, Muybridge
used
a
trip-thread
technique
in
his
photography to expose
in a series of frames the exact motions of
human beings and animals at play and in action. To Bacon, these
were as revealing as the unstudied pictures taken by press photogra-
phers of the great and the unsavoury. As John Rothenstein, his early
patron and most sympathetic critic, explained of his fascination for
the captured instant of the camera eye:
The photograph has had another effect on the art of Bacon besides
providing points of departure
for his imagery.
In the
traditional
portrait
there
is
a
direct
relation between
the
painter and
his
subject: sometimes they look at each other; sometimes the subject
looks elsewhere, but he or she
is aware of the presence of the
painter and, however informally,
is posing for him. The modem
photographer - the earlier worked under the influence of painting
-
catches
people when
they
are unaware
of his
presence;
off
balance, when they are not in the poses which they think most
dignified and
attractive, nor wearing
their 'Sunday
Best'. Pho-

The Chair and the Crucifixion
73
tography of this
order has done much
to
foster
in Bacon
his
predilection
for
portraying people
as
though
they were
alone,
unaware of any other presence.
*What modem man
wants', Bacon
said
to
Rothenstein,
quoting
Valery,
*is the grin without the cat; that is, the sensation without the
boredom of its conveyance.' He meant that the painter's job was
to remove the essence of the picture out of the exactitude of the
camera. A sweep of the brush would
eliminate
the
unnecessary
detail. A stroke of the mind would demolish in a photograph the
intrusion of a whip or a sock, a hat or a truncheon. While Muybridge
might portray absolute reality by his exposures of mammals in motion
caught at each two-thousandth of a second, Francis Bacon's percep-
tions of the
active
flesh would be captured on canvas
at the very
moment of violence and desire. There stood the abyss between the
technician and the artist, the instrument and the seer.
Bacon was aware of his
distortions of the recorded image. He
even painted portraits from photographs rather than from the sitter.
'But who can
I tear to pieces', he asked,
'if not my friends.^' They
would
understand
his
need
to
distance
himself from
reality by
photography in order to produce his inner vision of the truth beneath
the body. His pictures were always to be those of a surgeon, not the
cosmetic variety but the visceral. As he told John Russell, the news-
photograph of the 'thirties was his education in painting.
It formal-
ised disrespect.
It wrenched the figures of authority out of their high
places.
It caught them unguarded and inconsequent, 'racked by tics,
their
faces
distorted,
their
clothes
in
disorder,
their
bodies
off
balance'.
It was
the new
school
of truth
and
intrusion,
which
coincided with the arrival of Isherwood's civil monsters.
Bacon recorded in his mind's eye the leprosy of his time, but he
did
not
paint
it.
Yet he
did base one
unfinished
painting on
a
photograph of Hitler getting out of his car at a Nuremberg rally - a
painting which was abandoned before the start of the Second World
War and revised after the victory as 'Landscape with Car', before
it
was
left incomplete.
It showed originally a loathsome
reptile, dan-
gling and snarling over the windscreen of a car, and leaning to speak
into a battery of three microphones. He resurrected the concept in

74
Francis Bacon
another post-War picture, Tigure in a Landscape', which showed
the shape of Eric Hall
asleep
in
a London park on
a deckchair
instead of in a car, his body deconstructed to gristle and hair, while
the Nuremberg background was
replaced
with
harsh
grass
and
branches
as
if to
celebrate the
rigours of victory.
Hall's
suit was
actually painted in a thin grey wash, thickened with dust from the
floor. The
dust
lasted well and
did not change
its
colour. This
particular
vision was
to
surface
again
as one
inspiration
for
the
centrepiece of Bacon's first triptych of the screaming and mutilated
Eumenides or Furies.
To
the
retina
of
his
eye
and
the
camera
of
his
mind,
the
photographs of his violent times and newsreel images were more
important
to
Francis Bacon
than any
influences
he
might have
derived from the paintings of German Expressionism, New Objectiv-
ity, French Cubism or Surrealism. He had shown some pictures at
the Mayor
Gallery along with members
of *Unit One',
a group
headed by Paul Nash and Henry Moore, which included Surreal
works by Dali, Miro and Ernst. But when asked to contribute more
pictures
to
the
International
Surrealist Exhibition
in the June of
1936, Bacon found his works rejected for not being Surreal enough.
Two of the judges, Herbert Read and Roland Penrose, visited his
studio
at Glebe
Place
and viewed
three
or
four
large
canvases
including one with a grandfather clock. These were turned down,
although Penrose said later that Bacon had destroyed much from
that time and had 'become more
Surreal
in
his
later work' -
a
judgement that Bacon wholly rejected. He recalled Penrose declar-
ing, on his abortive Chelsea visit, *Mr Bacon, don't you realise a lot
has happened
in
painting
since
the
Impressionists.^' Moore
and
Sutherland and Nash did show their creations
at the International
Surrealist
Exhibition,
even
though
Herbert Read
had
declared,
'SurreaUsm in general is the romantic principle in art.' Romanticism
was never a principle in Bacon's
art. He was later to say that the
conscious mystery was the boring side of Surrealism. The only true
mystery is the way you bring the image about.'
With his contacts of importance, Roy de Maistre secured Bacon
his last showing in 1937 at Thomas Agnew and Sons in Bond Street.
An idea had been
floated
that an
artists'
co-operative should be

The Chair and the Crucifixion
75
founded,
similar
to
the Bloomsbury London
Artists'
Association
formed
in
1925 by Maynard Keynes and Samuel Courtauld. De
Maistre, the
Butlers, Kenneth Clark and Lord Balniel were con-
sulted, as well as Keynes and Courtauld, about raising capital for the
venture. The money was not forthcoming. The Agnew's exhibition
was the only benefit for the associated artists. None of the thirty-six
works on show cost more than forty guineas, and they included four
paintings by Sutherland and three by Bacon. One of these, Tigures
in
a Garden'
or 'Seated
Figure', was bought by Bacon's
cousin,
Diana Watson, and was shown
later
in an Arts Council
touring
exhibition. Another, called 'Abstraction from the Human Form', was
seen
by John
Rothenstein
before
Bacon
destroyed
it -
as
he
destroyed all his early work when he could get a knife to
it. He was
not unique in that. Degas and Monet used to destroy their past work
and especially Soutine, who influenced Bacon, and Giacometti, who
would become Bacon's friend
after the end of the Second World
War and
share
in
his
belief that
his works
of art were
mainly
unfinished failures. 'Oh, to be able to say', Giacometti would protest,
'that's
it,
I cannot do more.' Both he and Bacon rarely thought they
had come
to
the end of a painting, which sometimes had
to be
ripped, dripping, off their easels by their gallery owners to reach a
conclusion.
Rothenstein considered that 'Abstraction' was another inspiration
for the central panel of Bacon's 'Three Studies for Figures
at the
Base of a Crucifixion', painted at the end of the Second World War
after 'an almost complete break of seven or eight years ...
It
is as
though he was picking up where he left off The break from the end
of the 'thirties through the first years of the Second World War was
prolonged, indeed. Bacon even refused to design the scenery for a
production of The Schoolfor Scandal^ which Rupert Doone proposed
to put on at the fashionable Group Theatre. Doone had worked as a
dancer with Diaghilev and with Reinhardt in Berlin. His lover and
his usual costume and mask designer was the painter Robert Medley:
he put on the plays of the Berlin expatriates. Spender's
Trial of a
Judge and Auden and Isherwood's The Dog Beneath
the Skin, The
Ascent ofF6 and On the Frontier. But Bacon was no joiner of coteries
or causes. The fashionable Communism of the middle-class radicals

76
Francis Bacon
who
supported
the Group Theatre had no
appeal
for
him. He
remained on his own or with the few he knew well. Privacy was his
desire. 'Taking no part
in
society's
rituals, observing none of
its
canons or taboos', John Russell wrote of his friend, 'he just went on
as if none of them existed.'
The surviving originals and photographs of Bacon's work of the
'thirties show a young painter struggling to overcome the overpower-
ing influence of Picasso, and to a lesser extent the style of German
New
Objectivity and French
Surrealism,
also
the
designs of the
Bauhaus and Le Corbusier. A painting by de Maistre of the studio
in Queensberry Mews shows Cubist rugs and a powerful abstract
figure painted on the central panel of a screen. Seven of the rugs
designed and signed by Bacon still exist: they were so like paintings,
with multiple angular perspectives and apparent depths in space, that
they were hung as tapestries as often as they were used to cover the
floor. His painted screens had three
tall oblong figures standing on
sentry duty by Grecian pillars as unfathomable as those painted by
Giorgio de Chirico. The triple screen shape appears again in front
of a dead tree in one of his paintings shown in Queensberry Mews,
while his 'Interior of a Room', bought by his cousin Diana Watson
in 1933, 'Corner of the Studio' and 'Studio Interior' of the following
year, are the transitional pieces of an interior decorator becoming a
painter, with the sprawl of his menacing shapes
either cut off by
floral screens or shadowing floorboards and wallpaper and door with
their
implacable
presence.
'Corner
of the
Studio',
indeed,
was
bought by a woman who had hired Bacon to decorate and design the
furniture for her London flat. But the most individual of the surviving
pictures of that decade was also bought by Diana Watson, 'Figures
in a Garden' of 1936, sometimes known as 'The Fox and the Grapes'
or even 'Goering''and his Lion Cub'. In
it, a feral creature bares
its
teeth
at a squat and
skeletal tree trunk which suggests
a howling
face, while a harsh line divides the background as night from day. As
John Rothenstein wrote about Bacon's
early works, however, he
obviously had
an
extraordinary
natural
talent without any of the
conventional armoury of the painter, and so he did not yet have the
means 'of projecting an imagination of terrifying power and extreme
sophistication'.

The Chair and the Crucifixion
77
That
imagination
and
sophistication was
being
developed
by
Bacon's new mentor,
Eric
Hall, whom
Patrick White
called
the
*alderman\ Hall was
intelligent and had a great influence on the
wayward Bacon, who was taught 'the value of things', such as 'what
decent food was'. Bacon had not learned that in Ireland, only the
value of things abroad. When one of his pieces of furniture reached
County Kildare,
it became a subject of shocked surprise and was
known for fifty years as 'The Chair', as though
it were as dangerous
as the electric one on Death Row in America. His cousin, Pamela
Firth, saw one of his tables at Straffan Lodge - half a looking-glass
and half a transparent plate glass with a tubular steel support. From
Eric Hall, Bacon could accept an education which he had missed all
his Hfe - in food and drink and behaviour, in reading the classics
and in the appreciation of music and dance, as well as art. Although
he remained a bohemian, he was led by Hall into a double
life of
dinner-parties and concerts and viewing galleries with the cognos-
centi of the metropoHs. Hall was Bacon's Dante, his guide through
the
hell and purgatory of the
city. While Bacon's own father was
soon to die in 1940 and unlock his son's last inhibitions, the death
of Eric Hall after the Second World War would be the first of many
tragedies of love in the painter's life.
A friend of his, the art historian John Richardson, said that Bacon,
at this period, liked being kept by respectable middle-class gentle-
men in pin-striped suits with a perverse streak. 'What would really
excite me', he told Richardson, 'is a middle-aged Belgian commercial
traveller with hairy wrists - and a marquesite watch embedded in
that hair.' He loved an
illicit stuffiness, a slightly criminal respect-
ability. 'A fustian thing turned him on,' Richardson has said, and has
showed how the rabid beast in the genteel background occurs in so
many of his paintings, as in the transmutation of Eric Hall asleep in
his deckchair in the Park to a raw and wounded thing of slavering
menace in such a normal setting.
Meanwhile, the problem for the young artist was present existence.
Another one of his protectors took him into the Bath Club, among
the aristocrats, and installed his lover there as a telephone operator.
Such a penetration of the respectable fagade of London life appealed
to Bacon, but the switchboard job did not. He worked
in various

78
Francis Bacon
offices doing odd jobs, and for a time in the rag trade in a wholesale
shop in Poland Street, Soho, where he had to answer the telephone
again 'and that was about air. He became a gendeman's gentleman,
advertising himself under the name ofJohn Lightfoot, which implied
that he would not stay in any position for very long. He forged a set
of references, and so became the cook and manservant of a solicitor
who lived in Mecklenburgh Square. His situation did not last, but
nothing did
at
that time of transience.
Later, he would
tell two
stories of his departure. In one, his employer saw him dining with
Eric
Hall
at
the
next
table
at
the
Ritz on
his
evening
off and
immediately asked him to be off for ever. In another, he could not
stand his menial role any more and gave in his notice, only to hear
the
rejoinder,
'I
can't
understand why
he's
leaving because
he
doesn't do anything.'
He drifted into the bohemian world of Chelsea and Fitzrovia and
Soho, where
art and homosexuality were tolerated and even wel-
comed.
It was the ambience of Augustus John and Dylan Thomas,
of the patron Peter Watson and the itinerant editors and writers and
artists. The radical political
life of Britain was
still being managed
from Bloomsbury and Holborn and Covent Garden east of Fitzrovia,
where the bohemians and
misfits gathered
in the shadows of the
approaching World War. In his Memoirs ofa Public Baby, one of the
regulars,
Philip O'Connor, remembered how
the
artists
tried
to
exploit those who were slumming in the hope of meeting
artists.
Income was the
frontier. To him, Titzrovia was a national
social
garbage centre. But its inhabitants had the sweetness as well as the
gameness of humanity gone off. They lived a Hfe of pretence among
themselves,
and
the
successful
ones
pretended
also
to become
outsiders, leaving the district to slander it.'
Francis Bacon was truly an outsider before he came to Fitzrovia
and Soho, and he established his favourite haunts there, the French
Pub of Gaston Berlemont in Dean Street, Wheeler's Fish Restaurant
in Old Compton Street, and when he could afford
it, the Gargoyle
night-club with its decor by Matisse himself, where the dandy Brian
Howard once dismissed a heterosexual poet with the words, 'The
trouble, my dear,
is
that you're not one of us.' Through Roy de
Maistre and Eric Hall, Bacon had already achieved an entree to many

The Chair and the Crucifixion
79
of the wealthy patrons of the
arts, who enjoyed playing
at being
bohemian and
visiting the pubs of Fitzrovia,
like the
editor John
Lehmann
in search of male
flesh and talent for his New
Writing.
From the time of Oscar Wilde onwards, Soho and
its environs had
attracted those who wished
to mix
art and
sex with compliance,
without discovery and disgrace. Although class barriers and expec-
tations
still divided the rich from the poor bohemians, this area in
Central London was one place where they might forget nightly their
frontiers and their differences.
MachiaveUi wrote that half of a man's life was his vertii^ his skill as
well as his virtue, and half was chance, but when necessity came, he
had to bow his head. Bacon followed MachiaveUi in his existence,
for chance and the skill at exploiting chance were always a theme in
his life. Like Nathan Detroit in Guys and Dolls, he set up a moveable
and illegal gambling game. He had brought over from Ireland an old
nanny, and she used to act as a door-minder and hat-and-coat taker,
while Francis ran the roulette wheel and vingt-et-un games in the
inner room. As long as he took the house percentage and did not
hold the bank. Bacon made money on his gambUng operations, but
usually he plunged
as much as he plundered. His disdain for his
brief gains was legendary. He wasted what he had with a reckless
prodigality. The young Jeffrey
Bernard, who was
to become
a
drinking companion of his in Soho, remembered their first meeting,
introduced by the painter John Minton, who then was supporting
Bernard in the hope of the use of his body. In a smart new suit from
Savile Row, Bacon perched at the top of a step-ladder, painting the
studio
ceiling
pure
white. He
spattered
himself
in
paint
with
complete indifference. House decorating was not his
forte. When
Bernard asked him how he could ruin clothes that cost a hundred
pounds, he laughed. 'He threw it away like one of his one-liners.'
Bacon's awareness of decay and death was already set against the
improvisation of his life. He lived by his wit and his wits, from hand
to mouth, from night to day. Although intensely private, he cultivated
a growing circle of influential friends in the
arts, who admired his
independence and his gay abandon. The coming of the War would
both convert his bohemian society into the core of artistic activity in
Britain and recreate and hone the images of horror and destruction

that the boy had seen near Paddington Station and in the Park and
the cinema during the
First World War. The
blitz and
the
later
photographs of the concentration camps in Europe would score and
scratch more mutilations on the preserved memories of the
child,
whose
asthma would
still
keep him
as
an
adult
from
any
real
participation in the Second World War. And while he waited for the
declaration of
it, the parks of London were already being gouged
open again in preparation for a more terrible and probable rain of
death. Christopher Lee wrote of the urban landscape of 1939:
Great stripes, banks, mounds
across placid green of London commons, gravel
dumped sand, planks, bricks
ousting bright boats, cricket-bats and kites.
Needed perhaps, these shelters
for life and limb's sake, and their skelter of stuff
fantastic patterns, or strict beauty
like farmed, reclaimed land won from rough ground.
Yet walks, rides, nostalgic pond
which were themselves a shelter in quieter war
of relentiess industry, of London,
must be given back to boats, clerks, factory hands.

Come to the Execution
For when things are once come to the execution, there is no
secrecy comparable to celerity; like the motion of a bullet in
the air, which flieth so swift as it outruns the eye.
'Of Delay'
by Francis Bacon, Lord Verulam,
Viscount St. Albans
Like a watched kettle, the War did not come to the boil for a year
after
its
declaration.
In
the September of 1939, Londoners had
expected an immediate
destruction from Nazi dive-bombers,
the
agony of Guernica in the Spanish Civil War, that was commemorated
in Picasso's painting. Yet during the winter and the spring of the
next year, nothing much happened in a Phoney or Bore War before
the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force from Dunkirk in
France. In the words of Malcolm Muggeridge:
Every circumstance of war was present except warfare. Armies
existed, apparently in battle-array; uniforms were worn, both
at
home
and
abroad;
fortifications
were
dug,
passwords
were
exchanged,
trumpets were
sounded,
canteens
were
organized,
songs were sung - Washing to be hung on the
Siegfried Line,
Rabbit
to be made
to
run,
run,
run,
or of the
tenderer
sort.
Somewhere
in France with you
... So
strange
a
situation has
rarely
existed. Clouds were
dark and menacing;
the wind had
dropped and there was the stillness which precedes a mighty storm,
and
still the
first heavy drops of rain did not
fall,
still
it seemed
that, after all, no storm might come.

82
Francis Bacon
The artists and writers in London moved about in a state of intense
hallucination. Many
of them
joined
the
Auxiliary and
later
the
National Fire Service, among them Stephen Spender, Henry Green,
William Sansom and Leonard Rosoman, the painter. Others became
air-raid w^ardens or worked in the control rooms of the fire services
or
on
anti-aircraft
or
barrage
balloon
units.
Food
and
clothes
rationing were universal and accepted, black-out regulations necess-
ary and unpopular. Excepting a few insiders and profiteers, every-
body had
to put up with
it.
Civilians had
to
register
at shops
to
receive their variable weekly average of two shillings' worth of meat,
four ounces of bacon and cheese and
fat and tea, eight ounces of
sugar and two eggs. Clothes coupons had to be hoarded to buy a
coat, while petrol was practically invisible outside the black market.
The
black-out
turned
familiar
streets
into
dark
ravines
with
shaded
traffic-lights, buses creeping along like dimly
lit monsters,
taxis
all sombre inside and cars with headlamps no brighter than
cats' eyes. As Mass-Observation discovered: ^Nothing, no amount of
experience, makes you
really used
to the black-out. And however
little
it may change your habits, the consciousness of it, waiting for
you out there, behind the black material on the window,
is a threat
to any of the pre-War happy-go-lucky. Each evening expedition
is
now an
event, maybe
a dangerous
adventure.' Mass-Observation
also noted that lovers and prostitutes liked the black-out. It conferred
on
everybody
an
equality
of
clandestine
anonymity
before
the
radiance of the incendiaries that were to come from the sky.
In the pubs and in the
streets,
in the defence units and
in the
factories where men and women were drafted because of special
skills or disabilities which kept them from the armed forces, there
was little antagonism of class or background.
It did seem a people's
war on
the Hofne
Front, and
authority
lay
in
a
local warden
or
policeman or fireman, wearing a tin hat or a helmet or an armband.
Francis Bacon was
prevented
from
joining up by
his
sense
of
detachment and his asthma and sinus trouble. He had already had
an operation on the roof of his mouth several years before, but it had
not improved his sinus condition, which was only kept under control
by large doses of the drug M and B, that panacea before the age of
antibiotics.

said,

never have gone on painting at
all.' He knew that many artists had
suffered from asthma, Proust especially, but he could not assess just
how much asthma affected him. 'One can't account for the defor-
mations in the make-up of one's character as they are part of one's
whole make-up.' He was not conscious of asthma affecting his War.
To say it did, would be to falsify
it, as far as he knew. Yet he would
also claim that he had become aware of his allergy to dogs, hired an
Alsatian from Harrods, slept next to it overnight, and was so choked
in the morning
at his medical that he was
classified
as
unfit
for
military service.
However, his affliction did affect his
life during the blitz. When
the bombs began to rain from the sky. Bacon fled to the countryside
along with millions of other refugees from the metropolis. He lived
with
his
old nanny from
Ireland,
in
a
cottage
in
Petersfield
in
Hampshire, which was rented for him by Eric Hall, and where he
began to paint again. One of his few surviving figurative works of
that period, 'Man in a Cap', shows the yelling mouth of authority
under a peaked officer's cap, the body suggested as a crouched beast
squatting on a bar inside a cage. Bacon stayed in the country until
1942, when the pollen became almost as bad as poison gas and the
worst of the
air
raids seemed
to be
over. He
then returned
to
London and he bought the bombed studio of the Pre-Raphaelite
painter. Sir John Millais,
at 7 Cromwell Place, South Kensington.
There
his
old
nanny
slept
on
the
table,
muttering
about
her
obsession, the need for capital punishment. The whole roof of the
studio had been blown in by a bomb, but Bacon lived and painted in
the enormous billiard room at the back. He was now obliged to serve
sporadically
in
the ARP Rescue
Service,
until once
again severe
attacks
of asthma
brought
about
his
discharge
from
the
force.
'Anyone', he said later, 'who lived through the European wars was
affected by them.' They affected his whole psyche, because he had
'to live continuously under an atmosphere of tension and threat'.
He had been liberated during the Phoney War by the death of his
father, Anthony Bacon, who expired on
i June
1940,
at The Old
Rectory
in Bradford
Peverell, near Dorchester. Although the son
had drifted apart from the sire, he had not escaped from his love and
loathing of his parent. His brother Harley had emigrated to South

84
Francis Bacon
Africa and had joined the Rhodesian Police, where he contracted
tetanus while trying to cross the flooded Zambesi River and died of
lockjaw. This death so haunted Francis that a decade later, when he
gashed his finger while slicing chips to fry with his
fish, he turned
white and almost fainted with fear of poisoning. 'These are South
African potatoes,' he
said. Francis was the only one of the three
Bacon brothers
to reach the age of thirty and was named
in
his
father's will as his sole Trustee and Executor, a fact that argued that
there was no
absolute
estrangement. The
will
left
to
the
wife,
Winifred Christina, her marriage settlement, now in trust, to Francis
the sum of fifty pounds and equal shares in the residue of the estate
with his younger sister Winifred, although the probate declared the
total value of the effects to be a mere three-hundred-and-forty-four
pounds, five shillings and eightpence - not a fortune at the end of a
long military and horse-racing career. Anthony Bacon had sold most
of the plates printed with the family crest and two letters from the
famous Francis, Lord Verulam, Viscount St. Albans, to the Duke of
Portland to pay some of his gambling debts. His painter son and heir
would say of his genealogy and inheritance that he was called Francis
Bacon and was uncertain whether he was really a descendant. His
namesake had no
children and was
a homosexual. Whether
his
brothers perhaps had children, the artist was unsure, but if so, this
made him an heir of the great philosopher and statesman.
Excluded from the will was the eldest daughter lanthe, who had
gone
to
South
Africa
to work
as
a
volunteer
nurse.
Included,
however, was her younger sister Winifred, although she had made a
most unsuitable marriage to a lorry driver in the
first flush of the
War. She was
to have two children before her husband
left her.
Following that she met a second man, who almost immediately went
to
gaol. She would not
give him up, but waited
for
his
release,
keeping a house for paying guests with her mother off the Cromwell
Road in London. When he was let out, he disappeared, and Winifred
was to contract a form of paralysis which developed into multiple
sclerosis. Like his own asthma, the paralysis of his
sister horrified
Bacon emotionally, but intrigued him intellectually. The connection
between the mind and the body, where
stress induced
a malady,
fascinated
him.
His own
sickness and
those
of his
siblings,
the

85
asthma and the lockjaw and the paralysis, were to be reflected in his
portraits of diseased and suffering humanity.
Bacon's own nervous system was hardly improved by his service
in civil defence, although he did experience the terrible beauty of the

the yellow
flash of gunfire, the whitish-green
hiss of incendiaries,
the copper-red
reflection of the
flames,
the
criss-cross hatching of the searchlights, and in the streets of Pimlico
and Soho:
... the high scarfing columns of naked gas flame flaring like some
giant idealization of the naphtha flames that through the years had
lit their fairs and their stalls.
These were the lights - but there were also dark streets, streets
where suddenly a house of blackness collapsed with a roar, shifting
down heavily like some bricked elephant lumbering to
its knees,
thickening the darkness with a poisonous cloud of dust, shrouding
the moment after its
fall with a fearful empty silence broken only
by
small
sounds,
the whispering of broken water
pipes,
slight
shiftings of debris, moans and
little cries of the injured; then into
the torch-light of the wardens there would stagger those untrapped,
lonely
figures
in
the
dust-fog bleached
grey with powder and
streaked and patched with black blood; or - there would be nobody,
and not a sound, only a living silence in the knowledge that under
a smoking, spawning mass of timber and brick and dust there lay
pressed and
stifled bodies of warm people whose minutes were
slowly ticking away, whose rescue was absurdly blocked
.
.
.
The worst elements of the bombed streets were the rank smeUs and
the rabid cats. A raw and harsh stink pervaded the air, a compound
of soot and dust, cinder and the lingering acidity of high explosive.
Gas escaping from broken pipes tweaked
at the
nostrils, and the
sweet reek of blood and corpses made the lungs retch. MeanwhUe,
hordes of mad cats leapt and screeched, trying to find their old snug-
holes in the rubble of their owners' houses. Light as birds on the
treacherous debris, the cats often led the firemen to burned bodies.
And on
the
streets,
glass
glittered
like
frost on
grass and broke
underfoot in a strange grinding twinkle.
The morning after the raids revealed the houses disemboweUed,

the intimacies of private lives broadcast to the glare of the day. The
writer and artist Mervyn Peake served as a sapper in a bomb disposal
group. To him, the ruined houses v^ere not skeletons, but opened
bodies showing their coloured muscles and burst skin, vacant wombs
and organs
as rubble. Yet the very extent of the destruction also
revealed the old anatomy of London itself. On a December night on
Ludgate Hill, James Monahan could serve as the coroner of chaos
and see among the desolation the sinews and ligaments of the ancient
roads and patterns of the city, 'each criss-cross, curve, each cul-de-
sac, each square, a blueprint magical across the waste'. The heart of
history was
still beating, the dome of St.
Paul's
still stood serene
above the autopsy performed by a
blitz that had
sliced open the
fundamental design of bygone London.
So the general devastation changed the perceptions and the visions
of artists and transients in the
capital. This evisceration of people
and houses and
streets,
the
display of the
entrails of bodies and
places, these sights affected the art of Francis Bacon. The bombs
also stimulated the senses, awoke the eye. Men and women, after all,
were
alive and aware, while bricks and plaster were not. The
arts
revived with
a
fresh
significance.
'This
arose
spontaneously and
simply,' Stephen Spender wrote, 'because people felt that music, the
ballet, poetry and painting were concerned with
a seriousness of
living and
dying with which they themselves had suddenly been
confronted ... A
little island of civilisation surrounded by burning
churches - that was how the
arts seemed
in England during the
War.' The troops and the displaced
still swarmed to that last centre
of civilisation despite its battered geography and nightly mayhem.
Francis Bacon's own withdrawal from
art was matched by the
National
Gallery,
which had
removed
its
masterpieces
for
safe
storage
into
distised mine
shafts. The empty spaces on the walls
encouraged
the showing of the
art of the
people.
In December,
1939, the Royal Academy had given
its
first open show of contem-
porary art with more than two-thousand exhibits, including a portrait
in feathers of the young Princess Elizabeth. One leading painter,
John Piper, suggested that this might kill art with kindness. When an
exhibition by members of the armed forces was assembled to hang
on the bare walls of the National Gallery, Herbert Read fulminated:

Come to the Execution
87
*Even a worm could
lift his head above
this
level. What stretches
before us is the sordid scum left by a receding civiUsation. Aesthetic
criticism has no function here: it is an affair for the social pathologist.
But to that science the art critic is inevitably driven day by day, and
I
doubt whether the War has left him with any other relevant basis.'
Read had been influential in shifting the emphasis of British art
from the stifling formalism and classicism beloved by Roger Fry and
the Bloomsbury Group towards a neo-Romantic vision of painting,
its distant roots in the Celtic and Gothic past, in FuseH and William
Blake
and
Samuel
Palmer,
but
its
modern
stimulation
in
the
apocalypse of a world war. Peter Watson, the patron oi Horizon and
Poetry
London,
financed
the
young
neo-Romantic
painters,
the
Scottish lovers Robert Colquhoun and Robert MacBryde, along with
Lucian Freud and John Craxton, to whom he wrote, 'Nostalgia for
the past is not a valid vehicle for art now,
I am sure of that.'
As in the First World War, artists were now commissioned by the
Government, which bought their canvases and drawings. The better
of the
estabUshed
Surreal and neo-Romantic
painters produced
major work as a contribution to the struggle. Henry Moore would
become obsessed by the sleepers in the underground stations, trying
to avoid the bombs, the masses of the people camping deep under
the earth. Widely admired for their coherence and actuality, Moore's
Shelter sketches looked to Bacon like 'knitting when he's dropped
the stitches in the wrong place'. He refused the role of official war
artist which so many other painters took, such as his future jealous
friend, Graham
Sutherland, who
painted
aircraft and
tin-mines
and
steel furnaces and open-cast coal operations as well as bomb
damage in London - 'perspectives of destruction seeming to recede
into infinity'. John Piper also would paint bomb damage in addition
to the stylised control rooms of regional quarters of ARP command
posts and the Cardiff docks, which he sketched from the top of a
refrigerated warehouse, a sinister place of eighteen storeys of nothing
but meat, covered with
icicles. 'One knew one was alone with
all
those thousands of frozen carcases - very Kaflca-esque,' Piper wrote,
'Francis Bacon might have made something of it, but it didn't appeal
to me.' Another of Bacon's Soho friends, John Minton, would make
blitzed dockland the home of ghostly haunted children. And Paul

Francis Bacon
Nash converted the flying dreams of his childhood into pictures of
downed German aeroplanes that did not please his superiors in the
Air Ministry. A drawing of the wreck of an enemy machine on the
ground 'was rather like shooting at a sitting bird. In the slang of the
moment, they took a poor view of it'.
The dead sea of dumped German aeroplanes which Paul Nash
called Totes Meer was the supreme fusion of the Romantic vision and
the facts of the fighting - the best War picture so far, Sir Kenneth
Clark considered
in
1941. Without
a doubt, employment
as war
artists did stimulate the leading neo-Romantics, who were shocked
into a perception of the truth of conflict that wonderfully concen-
trated
their minds and
defined
their
paintings.
'Apart from
any
blockages and the tendency to self-destruction they shared with the
other war-babies
.
.
.' the Irish critic Anthony Cronin observed, 'the
English Romantics belonged to the War and immediate post-War.'
Too soon they were too late. The one genius among them, Francis
Bacon, did not look to the Celtic past or to his London contempor-
aries for his inspiration. 'How can you find the techniques of putting
over the eternal realities so that they shine violently as
reality.^' he
asked. Realities had to be renewed, while the basics were always the
same. The ways of conveying them became very tired. 'That is why I
hate all the late Romantics'. In answer to the calamities of his time -
holocaust and
fire raid and nuclear fission - he would turn to the
imprisonment of power
in Velazquez and
to
the scream
against
atrocity of Goya. His confined and flayed shapes caged in curtains
and boxes would have holes for mouths. They would howl dumbly
to be freed from pain and canvas, as the tens of millions of the dead
groaned
in
silence from
their untoward mass
graves. Bacon's
art
proved the flaw in the nationaUsm of tJie neo-Romantics. The long
experience of Eufope in its interminable internecine strife informed
the truest painter of his age.
One of the 'Lost Girls' of the time, Theodora Fitzgibbon, used to
drink with Bacon and the other young painters in the Horseshoe or
the Mandrake. She was delighted to have her looks compared to his.
They had both been brought up in the same part of Ireland. She
knew him for being a brilliant painter, working under great difficult-
ies, but praised
his
lack of malice and
his
'gay
equanimity;
his

troubles were not brought out for drinks'. At the time, his poverty
led him
to
painting
with
one-inch
thick
brushes
bought
from
ironmongers. The War was hell on
artists' materials. They had to
paint as they could in the colours they could find. ^London was dirty,
chaotic and dangerous,' John Craxton said. 'People were just about
managing to keep things ticking over.
It was unbearable.
I started to
read the works of several contemporary European writers and I often
thought how Kafka-esque London was during that period.'
Yet as in Kafka's constructions, there were strange connections
between people and places in wartime London. For painters, Fitzro-
via was
a casde of the
arts, where pub rooms led
to parties and
commissions from a hidden bureaucracy and a transient plutocracy.
There were jobs to be found not only from the War Artists' Advisory
Committee, but also from editors and theatre managers and
film
companies as well as from private patrons. Particularly, the patronage
of Peter Watson was the gluepot of the Fitzrovian painters. 'He was
a man everyone was in love with,' Stephen Spender remembered.
'He paid for everything.' Although he was a depressive and meeting
people was agony
for him, he had
the
rare
elegance
of a Beau
Brummel, 'which is to say by elimination'. Or so the young painter
Michael Wishart thought, pitying Watson for spending so much time
in the pursuit of love, 'a thankless task for so fastidious a homosexual,
despite
his haunted
beauty'. The
first and
last of his
objects of
passion were homicidal and larcenous, dissipating the collections of
modern paintings entrusted by Watson to their care. Through his art
editorship oi Horizon, he introduced its readers to the best of modern
British painting, educating a generation during the 'forties. In its last
issue at the end of the decade. Horizon would praise the transcendent
power of the art of Francis Bacon.
Watson's
little
flat
in Palace Gate was
a refuge and
a
cafe of
European taste. He bought works and subsidised painting trips for
John Minton and Francis Bacon as well as the older artists Graham
Sutherland and John Piper, while secredy giving money to the poets
David Gascoyne and Dylan Thomas, who made
it
all
disappear
'quick as a sardine'. He set up John Craxton in a studio with Lucian
Freud, who had spent
five months as a seaman on the dangerous
Adantic convoy run, and he bought the works of both of the young

90
Francis Bacon
painters. He was admirable in his reserve, his
tact, his generosity,
his
lack of ostentation and
his
taste
in modern
art. He used
the
bounty of his fortune from margarine to ease the lives of his talented
friends. He seemed to Stephen Spender almost American,
'extra-
ordinarily chic, like a character from Henry James'. He was the last
of the true private patrons of the arts before the coming of state aid
for
them. Under
the
pretence
of retouching
it,
Francis
Bacon
destroyed the picture w^hich Watson bought off him, as he did with
all of his early work when he could get his hands back on
it.
The cauldron and melting-pot of Soho and Fitzrovia in the War
led
to intense
friendships and passing encounters. The
editor of
Penguin New
Writings John Lehmann,
plunged
into
the
urban
underworld that brought together soldiers and
sailors and men of
letters and artists in an erotic transience more charged than the bars
and the sexual booths of Weimar Berlin.
The black-out heightened the sense of adventure as one slipped
into pub after pub. My sexual hunger was as avid as
it was with
so many others
at
a time when death seemed
to tease us with
forebodings of liquidation in terrors
still undeclared. One curious
manifestation of this was in the pubhc urinals. As never before,
and with
the
advantage
of the
black-out,
a number of these,
scattered
all
over
London,
became
notorious
for
homosexual
activities
.
.
. This was not my scene, but the pubs frequented by
the soldiery were: those caverns of light and potential sensuous
adventure that hid behind the blacked-out windows and the heavy
double
curtains
of the
doorway,
in
a
totally darkened though
sometimes moon-dramatised
cliff landscape. Faceless uniformed
figures passed me, fingers brushed my fingers, but
I hurried on,
ignoring the
solicitations of blindfold Eros until
I was in a place
where
I coul4 see and choose
for myself ... An atmosphere of
heightened emotion dominated; kisses were exchanged with those
one would never in normal times have reached the point of kissing;
declarations of devotion and admiration were made
that might
never have come to the surface otherwise; vows to keep in touch,
to form closer and more meaningful aUiances when peace returned.
So In
the Purely Pagan Sense described
the encounters of young
serving men with a leading literary editor in the first year of the War.

Come to the Execution
91
A Fitzrovia regular and
artists' model with hennaed hair, Quentin
Crisp, agreed. Along with some of the younger painters, he had been
exempted from military service as an overt homosexual, said to suffer
from sexual perversion although he
gloried
in
it. He
lived
in the
world
of bookies
and
burglars,
artists
and
actresses,
poets
and
prostitutes who haunted
Fitzrovia. These were now joined by the
War deserters, who existed in the cafes and stayed for weeks on end
in a cellar called The Low Dive, until the military police swooped
on them. Crisp liked the time because the women had gone butch
and took to uniforms, and he could at last wear women's trousers
and black, lace-up shoes with firm, medium heels. London by night
became
'one
of those
dimly-lit
parties
that
their hosts hope
are
slightly wicked'. But when bombs started
to
fall,
'the
city became
like a paved double bed. Voices whispered suggestively to you as you
walked along; hands reached out if you stood
still and in dimly
lit
trains people carried on as they had once behaved only in
taxis'.
Railway carriages were the playground of exhibitionists. 'The whole
of London was one long tovv^ath, one vast movie house.' This was
'the feast of love and death that St. Adolf had set before the palates
of the EngHsh - parched these long dark twenty-five years. And
along Piccadilly, the regular
tarts
still walked their beats, carrying
gas masks, which seemed
to offer a grim sort of sex,
a threat of
terminal disease behind the smiling question, "Hallo, dearie - want
a little love.^"'
This was the wartime London at night of Francis Bacon, who was
attracted to Soho as the stimulus and rendez-vous
for
artists and
homosexuals like himself. His chief port of call was the York Minster
or French Pub run by Gaston Berlemont, whose father Victor once
had the cellar fixed as a ring for the use of the great French boxer
Carpentier. He was no regular at the two gay pubs, the Golden Lion
and the Fitzroy Tavern, but he always tried to eat well to anchor the
alcohol swilling inside him, particularly at Wheeler's in Old Compton
Street round the corner from the French Pub. Something that Bacon
had learned from his regular lover, Eric Hall, was that good food
would prolong a life spent drinking too much good wine. Depending
on the state of his finances and those of his friends, he would also
drink in the Gargoyle along with fellow artists such as John Minton

92
Francis Bacon
and
Lucian
Freud, who was
introduced
to
Bacon
by Graham
Sutherland
in
1943
as
a
'fantastic
painter, Hke
a
cross between
Vuillard and Picasso'. Bacon found the Gargoyle 'a wonderful club'
and after drifting in, he would go to a lean-to cafe on a bomb-site in
Dean Street, 'where about four o'clock in the morning you could go
and have tea and bacon sandwiches.
It was a kind of all-night thing
- it was a lovely life.'
In
spite
of his
small production and
destroyed
works, Bacon
already had influence over Sutherland and Freud, who was to paint
the portrait of him that hung in the Tate Gallery before
it was stolen
in Berlin, and also intensely to admire the evocative power of his
friend's handling of paint. Until then, as John Rothenstein recorded,
Freud had drawn constantly in the confidence that his pen or pencil
could express his ideas fully. But seeing Bacon's flow with a brush,
he was made 'aware, as never before, of his need to represent volume,
more naturally fulfilled by the brush than the pencil'.
In order to
stimulate his urge to paint as fluently as Bacon, Freud now denied
himself the delight of drawing. He found Bacon
'the wildest and
wisest' person he had ever met. And he was to do more than was
expected of him. 'Opinion was divided as to whether he would have
a career comparable to that of the young Rimbaud, or whether he
would
turn out
to be one
of the doomed youths who
cross
the
firmament of British art like rockets soon to be spent.'
Bacon did not spend
all
his time drinking or cruising in what
George Melly has described
as the
classless
or class-aphrodisiac
acceptance of pre-War and wartime homosexual circles, 'their belief
in the self-sufficiency of the chic, the "amusing", the new; the love
of
glitter and
danger;
the
belief in hard work
at
the
service
of
sensation'. For h|e had learned his own concentration on hard work
from his first tutor Roy de Maistre, as Patrick White had along with
him. In White's words:
He also taught me to discipline myself as an artist.
I had seen him
close his door in the faces of casual callers.
I thought
it a cranky
joke.
I
did
not
really
get
the message
till
I found he
did
not
discriminate.
It hurt
at
first.
I saw him
as
a sour
old
bastard.
Nowadays when
I close the door on some importunate, destroyed

Come to the Execution
93
face
I feel as though the
spirit of Roy de Maistre
is at my elbow
supporting me. His work was what mattered, much as he enjoyed
social occasions when the ingredients were sympathetic.
Bacon also began to concentrate and to exclude, to put work before
drinking with his friends. He
still lived marginally from his
illegal
gambling sessions, but he took more and more to the brush again, as
if his
father's death and the
daily menace of war had loosed
his
inhibitions and set him free. For the first time as an artist, he could
say, as his great ancestor Francis Bacon had said about his philos-
ophy, that his painting 'came as a guest, not as an enemy'. He began
to record his fears and his nightmares, his visions and his observ-
ances, as three Furies or Eumenides, screaming at the cataclysm of
this world.
Many of Bacon's influences were literary. He read deeply, but not
widely. He could not
say,
as the philosopher Francis Bacon had
written,
'I have taken all knowledge to be my province'. He plumbed
some knowledge to
its profundities. Yet he could claim as his own
the
title of one of his
ancestor's works,
Cogitata
et
Visa. He had
considered and seen the abyss of himself and his age. In The Waste
Land by T. S. Eliot, he discerned his bleak views:
I will show you fear in a handful of dust
.
.
.
But at my back in a cold blast I hear
The rattle of the bones, and chuckle spread from ear to ear.
His favourite line of Aeschylus, that he would endlessly repeat, was,
The reek of human blood smiles out of him.' Shakespeare also was
his
study,
particularly
for the images
that rose
in
his mind
after
reading the soliloquies of Hamlet or the horrors of King Lear, when
Gloucester is blinded to Cornwall's words, 'Out, vile jelly! Where is
thy lustre
now.^', and gives the answer,
'All dark and comfortless'.
But in his 'Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion'
Bacon's inspiration was the Greece of Sophocles and Pericles, when
the
Furies were loosed on
the
land by the
insane long struggle
between Athens and Sparta. These were the three divine avengers

94
Francis Bacon
which he painted during the Second World War,
to express
his
protest at its dread carnaUty.
'Each panel represented a horrific creature, half human and half
animal,' John Rothenstein wrote of the
triptych before
Eric Hall
presented it to the Tate Gallery - extremely angrily because his offer
to do so had been ignored for several months. 'That on the left hand
is
tensely bowed
as though
for beheading;
that
in
the
centre,
a
defeathered ostrich, with a mouth in place of a head, emerging from
a bandage; and that on the right, a long-necked creature with a huge
open
mouth,
screaming,
with
ears
but
faceless,
yet
voracious,
infinitely malignant.' These were the paintings in embryo which Sir
Kenneth Clark saw when Graham Sutherland took him to Bacon's
studio at Cromwell Place, along with the unfinished, reptilian 'Figure
in a Landscape', which Bacon would complete from a snapshot of
Eric Hall asleep in the Park. Acting then as Director of the National
Gallery as well as Chairman of the War Artists' Advisory Committee,
the
urbane
Clark
glanced
over
Bacon's
few
canvases and
said,
'Interesting,
yes. What extraordinary times we
live
in.' Then he
walked out of the studio.
Bacon was understandably annoyed. He turned
to Sutherland,
who had been
telling him not to work in a vacuum, but to meet
important people in society, and he said: 'You see, you're surrounded
by cretins.' But later that evening when Sutherland dined with Clark,
he heard something which excited his jealousy about his fellow artist.
'You and I may be in a minority of two,' Clark said, 'but we may still
be right in thinking that Francis Bacon has genius.' He did not add
that he thought Sutherland had genius as well, although he was to
buy his work, and not Bacon's,
still too raw as yet for his
taste.
Sutherland did, however, bring Bacon's paintings to the attention of
Sir Colin Anderson, who was to buy his 'Study for a Crucifixion' of
1933 from the Redfern Gallery thirteen years after
it was painted,
and later 'Owls' from the Hanover Gallery in the
'fifties. And Eric
Hall was to foster Rothenstein's interest in Bacon's
art, presenting
pictures he had bought from his lover to the Tate Gallery with a
declaration from the Athenaeum that one of them was among 'the
best paintings Bacon has painted and
I have known his works
for
twenty years.'

Come to the Execution
95
Bacon entertained the conventional Graham Sutherland and his
wife Kathleen to dinner almost every week in Cromwell Place. The
salad bowl often had paint in
it, but the wine and food were good in
spite of rationing, and the conversation was even better. Certainly
the influence of Bacon on Sutherland was pervasive, but unrecog-
nised
even by
Sutherland
himself, who
disapproved
of Bacon's
spasmodic life, as Rothenstein called it - 'first a painting spasm, then
a drinking or social spasm. He liked the hazards of Soho by night
and was by nature a gambler.'
'Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion' was being
hung
in
the
Lefevre
Gallery with works by Henry Moore
and
Matthew Smith and other British artists in April, 1945, one month
before the Nazi surrender in Berlin.
It seemed to howl against the
massacre of the twenty million dead and more in the conflict, just as
the nation was about to celebrate a victory that seemed to be justice.
Bacon had worked on a triptych in the
last years of the War,
his
traumas
put on board
with rough
strokes. He
admitted
to
the
influence of Picasso's work in the 'twenties, but he had gone further
in distorting the organic form that related to the human image. After
his
death
in
1992, Richard Cork was
to
suggest
the
continuing
impact of
'this howl of peace
at
a
universe
so meaningless
that
humanity is reduced to the level of a gruesome accident'.
The
triptych arrangement enabled him
to
join three repugnant
creatures in one work. At the same time,
it isolates each presence
within
gilt frames so that none can alleviate the other's torment.
The female figure on the
left, saddled with a pair of limp feelers
hanging from her shoulder-stumps, cranes forward.
She seems to be trying to sHde off her perch and discover what
is happening in the central panel, but cannot move. Paralysis also
affects the monster on the right, a hump-back oddity with starved
ribs who can only stretch out its distended neck and utter a helpless
roar.
The realistic human ear attached to this screaming head clashes
with the animality of its body. And the same principle of shock
through contrast applies to the patch of grass growing so unexpec-
tedly in the orange ground which gives the whole triptych such a
parched and eye-smarting air.
The impulsive handling of paint and pastel, smeared, scraped.

96
Francis Bacon
slashed and dragged over the hardboard rather than appHed with
conventional
refinement, shows
the urgency with which Bacon
set down this atheistic vision of hell. But discipline counters the
rhetoric wherever you look.
Spare black oudines brushed in behind the figures lend order to
the
triptych, and direct our attention towards the middle. Here,
the
focal image
offers no trace of a body on a cross.
Instead,
a
beast as brutish as its companions bares jagged teeth at us.
The
beast could be
growling,
like
an enraged dog warning
strangers not to get too close. Or
it might be yelling because
its
eyes, Hke poor Gloucester's in King Lear^ have been put out. The
ambiguity
is
left exposed,
for Bacon understands that a cry can
signify aggression just as easily as pain.
The triptych was to receive some hostility for its ferocity, one critic
writing that Bacon had discovered 'in the art of painting the felicities
of the death warrant [and] covered the lamp-shades of his immediate
predecessors with human skins.' He did shock, he did strike for the
bowels, the inner nerve. Yet alone, on the verge of the discovery of
the holocaust and the use of atomic
fission to decompose human
beings and their cities, Bacon realised his three Furies in appropriate
images for the terrible end of the Second World War. As he once
said to Francis Russell,
*I think of myself as a kind of pulverizing
machine into which everything I look at and feel is fed.' He read the
entrails of his half century, pulverised them and vomited his three
Eumenides in paint.

A Commendable Prodigality
None can character him to the life, save himself ... He and
his servants had all in common, the men never wanting what
their master had, and thus what came flowing in unto him
was sent flying away from him, who in giving of rewards
knew no bounds but the bottom of his own purse. Wherefore
when King James heard that he had given ten pounds to an
underkeeper by whom he had sent him a buck, the King said
merrily, i and he shall both die Beggars', which was
commendable prodigality in a subject.
Thomas Fuller on Francis Bacon,
Lord Verulam, Viscount St. Albans
from The Church-History ofBritain^ 1655.
The feeling of mental and physical exhaustion at the end of the War
among British
artists was
allied
to a sense of powerlessness. The
monstrous regimentation of the War was only to become worse in
the
state
socialism
of the
peace. And
from
that
lassitude
and
impotence, a myth and a justification would grow that would become
a truism of art and literary history. The events of the War were too
appalling to describe or depict. They were beyond the capacity of
the
artist, who would
never comprehend
the
long agony of the
holocaust nor the obliteration by the atom bomb. In his own reaction
from his memory of tossing his 'bricks' of fire and annihilating
all
living things on a Proustian beach and watching the destruction of
his fellow rocket-ships off Walcheren, William Golding later wrote a
full
assertion
about
the
impossibility
of bearing
witness:
'The
experiences of Hamburg and Belsen, Hiroshima and Dachau cannot
be imagined. We have gone to war and beggared description all over

98
Francis Bacon
again. These experiences are like the black holes in space. Nothing
can get out to let us know what
it was like inside.
It was like what
it
was like and on the other hand
it was like nothing else whatsoever.
We stand before
a gap
in
history. We have discovered
a
limit
to
literature.'
Francis Bacon would prove that there was no
limit to painting.
And Golding bypassed
his
limit to
literature
in many of his own
novels;
their
sense
of moral
evil and human
frailty
reek
of his
experience of war. Although Golding personally avoided Belsen and
Hiroshima, he could not avoid the pictures and descriptions of them.
In point of fact,
the
direct experience of Belsen, along with
the
photographs and newsreels taken by the Americans of the concen-
tration camps, did change British painting, while the age of nuclear
fission decomposed the
arts. Mervyn Peake was then beginning to
write his three eerie and Gothic illustrated manuscripts, Titus Groan
and Gormenghast and
Titus Alone, the best of their kind since the
works of Thomas Love Peacock. In 1945 he was sent to Belsen to
prepare a series of drawings for the Leader magazine. He had already
foreseen what he would witness in his chef d'oeuvre, his drawings for
Coleridge's *The Rime of the Ancient Mariner'. His ^Nightmare
Life-in-Death' was Belsen incarnate. When he returned from the
camp, his wife found he looked inward, 'as if he had lost, during that
month in Germany, his confidence in life itself.
Graham Sutherland had
felt some compunction about drawing
the victims of the
blitz and had
often taken photographs
of the
destruction rather than sketch the
sufferers among the
ruins. He
experienced the horrors of war directly, when his last assignment as
a war artist was to depict the wrecked flying-bomb launching sites
north-west
of
Paris. He
found
a panoramic
devastation,
houses
reduced to black-* spokes, and in the caves the fragments of bodies,
which he drew, but which were not exhibited by his state employers.
He never saw the concentration camps, although he
said
that
in
some ways he would have
liked
to have seen them.
'I remember
receiving a black-covered American Central Office of Information
book dealing with the camps.
It was a kind of funeral book. In
it
were
the
most
terrible
photographs
of
Belsen,
Auschwitz
and
Buchenwald
.
.
. The whole idea of the depiction of Christ crucified

A Commendable Prodigality

became more real to me after having seen this book and it seemed to
be possible to do this subject again.'
Sutherland
thought
that
the
disasters
of the
time
did
affect
painters, who were a kind of blotting paper, bound to soak up the
implications of modern chaos. At the Lefevre Gallery show of April,
1945, five of his paintings were hung with Francis Bacon's seminal
triptych, of his howling Furies. Influenced by Bacon's work and the
Griinewald altarpiece of the Isenheim Christ that had inspired the
Expressionists, and by his own studies of twisted trees and thorns in
Wales, Sutherland
set about
his magnificent
'Crucifixion'
for
St.
Matthew's Church in Northampton. His agonised Christ was pierced
with
thorns
of light and caged
with
bars and
arcs
of wire. To
Sutherland, the thorns were the cruelty, while the tortured body of
the Saviour was derived from Griinewald and the Belsen dead who
looked 'like figures deposed from crosses'. They seemed eternal and
classic beside
'the continuing beasdiness and cruelty of mankind,
amounting at times to madness'.
Francis Bacon collected newspaper and magazine photographs of
Adolf Hider and
the Nazi
leaders, and he saw the newsreels of
Belsen at the Rialto Cinema by the bombed Cafe de Paris. Unlike
the ordered and
accurate
Sutherland,
the
anarchic Bacon would
never admit to
his
direct influences, claiming sometimes
to work
while drunk and at other times saying that chance made him paint as
he did. In a discussion with this author, he admitted to the direct
influence of the Belsen newsreels, but only through
'an
intense,
active unconsciousness.
I see the violence of existence. We must
recall
it.' Technique was
all to him. He did not draw, but painted
direct on to the coarse side of the canvas. As it happens, he did do a
series of concentration camp pictures, which were owned by Keith
Lichtenstein, once
the proprietor of the Gigolo
cafe
in Chelsea.
They showed the horror of the Holocaust, but they do not appear in
the present catalogues of Bacon's paintings, so many of which he
has destroyed himself. The gaping mouths of his figures in torment,
the white streaks that enclose them like torture cages, the distorted
bodies
swollen by
death
or
greed,
these
did
derive,
as
did
the
drawings of Goya, from images of human bestiality which Bacon saw
in blurred photographs and moving pictures from the War.

1 00
Francis Bacon
Bacon denied that his aggression in painting had anything to do
with the aggression of fighting. He had been accustomed to Hving
through forms of violence which had offended him - the miUtary
violence of his Irish boyhood and brutal early affairs with the grooms
in his father's stables, the emotional violence of his
life in Weimar
Berlin and Paris in the 'thirties and wartime London. Yet he looked
beyond the violence of war 'to remake the violence of reality itself
... the
brutality of fact'. Although contemporary pictures of pain
and wounds influenced his images, he wanted to create a universal
statement about the suffering of man. His human corpses, his figures
of Christ hung like mutton in a butcher's shop, showed a belief in
the
absolute
mortality of man without hope
of redemption.
'Of
course, we are meat, we are potential carcasses.'
Worse was to happen in the early August of 1945. The atomic
bombs were dropped
at Hiroshima and Nagasaki
in Japan. The
War in the Pacific was, indeed, over. This has killed a beautiful sub-
ject,' the leading Australian physicist said; but a hundred and
fifty
thousand
civilians had
also been
killed,
and perhaps
twice
that
number were to rot and peel and erode over the next forty years,
while their children would be born maimed and deformed. The sight
of the explosion on the newsreels, a fireball depending on the stem
of a cloud toadstool sixty-thousand feet high, seemed to signify the
end of the Second World War, and perhaps of all war. But for the
survivors of the explosion, only a slow and pained decomposition was
left for them. Even some physicists such as Isador Rabi felt that an
ancient equilibrium in nature had been upset. Human beings were
now a threat to the world given them to live in.
Bacon's paintings of that year reflected the menaces of his age.
To
his 'Figure
in
a Landscape', he added spouting machine-gun
barrels or tubes of poison gas hissing in death chambers, while the
orifices of the
figure were wounds
as much
as mouths. And
his
Tainting, 1946', which was bought by Erica Brausen of the Redfern
Gallery
for
a hundred pounds and
sold on
to
the Museum
of
Modern Art for a mere
fifty pounds profit, was redolent of decay
and bleeding meat under a mushroom cloud, here represented by a
black open umbrella, covering
a ghoulish
dictator

a red plush
amphitheatre, approached by the tubular railings of Bacon's Bauhaus

A Commendable Prodigality
loi
furniture. Bacon called the carcass at the back of the painting 'the
armchair of meat':
it was
a gruesome replacement of the
ornate
throne of the traditional state portrait. In his blithe way, as always,
the spokesman of chance. Bacon said to John Rothenstein that his
picture did not represent a relation between an aspect of spirituality
and
of carnality. He had begun
that
particular picture with
the
intention of showing a bird of prey alighting on a ploughed
field.
*The
carcass.'' Well, when
I was a boy,
I used to be fascinated by
butchers' shops.' Actually, he had used chance to put together three
of the major themes of his time, which also preoccupied him - war
and the dictator and dead meat. He had achieved,
first of all, the
synthesis of the European grand manner with contemporary Surreal-
ist art.
Comparing
this
picture
to
the
triptych
of the
previous
year,
Rothenstein discerned contrary procedures in Bacon. Set against the
retention
in
his mind over
a long period of a particular, defined
image were the happenings of chance and automation. *He is capable
of giving
effect
to
a most
precisely
formulated
intention
or
of
abandoning such an intention - he does not begin a picture without
one - in order to follow blind inspiration, when he becomes a sort of
figurative
action-painter working under
the
spell of the subcon-
scious.' Bacon himself rejected any influence from action painting,
particularly that of Jackson Pollock, saying, 'Starting from an image
I want to be formal and vivid and yet to be vivid you have to be by
chance. If I throw a lump of paint on the floor,
it has vitality but no
control. Pollock is not formal enough for me.' When he was asked if
the wings of the bird of prey had perhaps become the umbrella or
the forelegs of the background carcass, he replied the bird disap-
peared early in the process of coaxing out the image of the dictator
taken
from
his
war
photographs
of Goebbels
or
Himmler
or
Mussolini, or even Roosevelt in his cape at Yalta and T. S.
Eliot's
Apeneck Sweeney, 'with the oval O cropped out with teeth' of his
murderer's mouth.
Bacon's formative years as
a furniture designer, and the Cubist
influence of Picasso, led him to impose a curious discipHne on his
paintings. Often within the gilt frame, there are other painted frames.
In the case of Tainting,
1946', the
railings seem to enclose steps

that lead up to the ribcage of the hanging carcass as well as to the
rostrum,
where
the
carnivorous
dictator
grimaces
and
devours.
Tassels hang ready
to
pull crimson
curtains
across
the
altar of
immolation, where Sweeney waits for his victims. The shock lies in
the incongruity, the black umbrella above the bestial monster, the
plush surroundings to the bloody meat, as if a genteel ritual enclosed
the massacre of every day. Later, he called the picture one of the
'most unconscious paintings' he had ever done. As for the meat, he
had always thought how extraordinary carcasses were, hanging in
great butchers' shops, *how amazing their colour was, how beautiful
they looked'.
Other paintings of the time were wrongly called 'Magdalenes' or
'Studies
for Human Figures
at the
Cross'. They were associated
with Bacon's 'Three Figures at the Base of the Crucifixion', but he
said he never thought of any of these figures as the Magdalene and
never
associated them
in
any way with
the
Cross.
All
of these
different three figures were crouching with their heads down. One,
which was destroyed, showed a huddled creature behind a cluster of
blue flowers and hidden by a herringbone overcoat and a grey hat.
The second figure copied the mourning shape and enlarged the coat
and the hat against an orange background. The third figure showed
the long neck and arm and head of a woman screaming
like the
nurse in the film of The Battleship Potemkin, her head covered by an
open umbrella, her buttocks and legs still draped in the herringbone
coat. Its composition was reminiscent of the women in Griinewald's
triptych
at Isenheim and
Giotto's 'Mourning the Dead
Christ'
at
Padua. The umbrella represented the dark halo of the modern age,
the poison cloud of the nuclear threat from the
air,
its ribs spread
like
the black
lines of sound
in Munch's 'The
Cry' and comp-
lemented by the ^piky fronds of the tropical plant in the foreground.
The effects of spokes and leaves radiating from the hole and howl of
the cavern of the mouth
still make the picture cry out to the eyes.
Bacon admitted that he never succeeded in painting the smile.
Yet Bacon could not stand the dreariness of London
after the
War. There was a draining of energy in the lacklustre and rationed
peace. The
writer Constantine Fitzgibbon agreed,
describing the
atmosphere among the demobilised and the Fitzrovians in 1945
'as

A Commendable Prodigality
103
one of exhaustion shot through with violence and hatred. We read
about the concentration camps, and we wondered which pub would
have beer tonight. We were horrified by Hiroshima, which seemed
to make
it
all meaningless, and we wanted out.' Bacon already felt
himself a European
after
his
visits
to
Berlin and
Paris, and he
particularly wanted out to France, joining in the Gadarene rush of
the piggish men of letters to their beloved land after
its liberation.
John Lehmann, despite help from the Publishers' Association and
the British Council, found himself outdistanced on the run to Paris
by Cyril Connolly and Raymond Mortimer 'and other literary lights
of the London wartime firmament'. The artists of Fitzrovia were not
far behind
in
their stampede
towards good
food and wine
and
Mediterranean light. The lanky, wild and gangling John Minton left
the ravaged docklands of London to travel south with the poet and
editor, Alan Ross. They went to Corsica to draw and write Time Was
Away for John Lehmann. Michael Ayrton and John Craxton left for
Italy and Greece. And taking the £100 from Erica Brausen for his
Tainting, 1946', Francis Bacon returned to the France that he loved,
settling in the Hotel de Re near the casino in Monte Carlo, where
he became obsessed by gaming. He would enter the casino at ten
o'clock in the morning and spend sixteen hours there, coming out at
dawn. At one point, he won sixteen hundred pounds
sterling, not
subject to British foreign currency regulations, and took a villa and
filled
it with drink and food and 'an enormous number of friends'.
He
spent
the
lot
in
ten
days,
indulging
in
his
commendable
prodigality. What came flowing in was sent flying away from him. He
felt of gambling as he
felt of painting: he wanted to win even if he
always lost. He loved living 'in gilded squalor'.
He gambled at roulette because it was impersonal. He disliked the
relationships between players at chemin-de-fer. At Monte Carlo, he
had a long patch of very good luck. He thought he could hear the
croupier
call out the winning number before the
ball
fell into the
socket of the spinning wheel, and he would play three tables
at a
time, putting small stakes on the numbers on each of them. But he
stressed that he was not like Dostoevsky's The Gambler, who played
for the thrill of losing more than he had.
'I feel
I want to win,' Bacon
told David
Sylvester,
'but then
I
feel
exactly
the same
thing
in

104
Francis Bacon
painting.
I feel
I want to win even if I always lose.' Later, he would
modify his words, saying that something happened
in painting as
well
as gambling - 'greed caused him
to
take
a
risk beyond
his
powers'.
He confirmed that to Michael Wishart, who personally saw the
pyramids and troughs of Bacon's bank account
in Monte
Carlo,
anything from a low of five pounds to a peak of a thousand pounds.
'Nothing
is more wonderful and refreshing than being completely
cleaned out,' Bacon confessed to Wishart, who appreciated such a
thrill of masochism. 'Losing
is better than winning.' When back in
England, Bacon went frequently to the greyhound racing tracks with
Wishart, darting away from the champagne dinners
in the White
City to place his bets. His compulsion remained with him always,
even when he was to make fortunes from Marlborough Fine Art. As
Wishart said. Bacon might have more money than he knew what to
do with, but 'he was winning and losing at the London casinos in
ratio to what he was getting from the Marlborough.'
One
morning, when
he
came
back
from
the
Casino
de
la
Mediterranee, Bacon had a telephone
call telling him that his old
nanny had had a stroke. He left on the first Blue Train for England,
and on his return, Wishart met him at the Gare de Lyon. Bacon was
inconsolable and weeping. 'She was far and away the most important
person in his life,' Wishart reported. 'His devotion was like that of a
son.'
With this last attachment gone in England, Bacon stayed on mosdy
in Monte Carlo for the next four years. Eric Hall visited him there
and continued to support him. Bacon was
still searching for older
men to love. 'I'm looking for a cruel father,' he told Wishart; he was
still looking for his own father he had left. Yet Monte Carlo did his
painting
little good, although he learned a technique which was to
change his art. The Mediterranean light was too strong for him after
the greyness of England.
It interfered with his vision. But after he
had
lost his money in the casino and wanted
to paint, he turned
round some used canvases and discovered that
it was easier to work
on the unprimed
side. Instead of destroying his
failures, he used
their reverse and rough surfaces in France and continued to do so
for the rest of his
life. Poverty was the father of his invention. He

A Commendable Prodigality
105
found a villa on the heights above Monaco with a wonderful room to
work in, or so he told Erica Brausen.
It had windows all round and
sensational views, and he even thought of decorating a club with
murals when he was not trying to track down 'the movements of the
fleet'. This project did not come to pass, but when Bryan Robertson,
then the director of the Whitechapel Gallery, was to rent Bacon's
villa on the foothills of the Alps, after having been drunk under the
table at many dinners with the painter in the old Carlton Grill in
London, he was to find a bedroom
full of abandoned canvases of
startling images and a cupboard stuffed with a comprehensive library
on sexual perversions, 'which added a certain zing to hot afternoon
siestas'.
Although he was
to
escape frequendy
to France and
later
to
Tangier, Bacon was to remain a resident of London most of his Ufe.
One
terrifying
night,
trapped
in
a
hotel room near Cannes and
surrounded by
forest
fires, made him remember
the
blitz. Even
a refuge
in France could be
like being in London again. Yet he
confessed to few EngUsh influences, mainly to European ones, such
as Velazquez and Goya, Cimabue and Giotto and Titian, Griinewald
and Rembrandt, Degas, and Picasso and Giacometti - who painted
in
1946
a
curiously Baconian
picture of the French
arts patron
Marie-Laure de Noailles, looking like a blackened snail crawling out
of its shell. Both of them were particular in working out their original
combinations of philosophy and painting and experience - a synthesis
between Existentialism as preached by Sartre and Camus, a legacy
from
Surrealism, and
their personal
bite on
the
bullet of living
through world wars.
While Bacon became the major influence on English art, he took
little from
it, except an admiration
for Matthew Smith and Con-
stable's sketch of 'The Leaping Horse', depicted in agitated motion,
in the Victoria and Albert Museum. Certainly, Bacon took nothing
from his contemporary neo-Romantics, although his personal influ-
ence was immediately visible in getting Graham Sutherland and his
wife
to come
over
to
the South of France.
First, he persuaded
Sutherland to show with him
at the UNESCO exhibition in Paris
along with Picasso and Braque. But he wrote back that he found all
their work boring and lacking in reality and immediacy. Even with

io6
Francis Bacon
Picasso, decoration was contaminating
all. He
felt he might be on
the verge of doing something good and was working on three studies
from photographs of the Velazquez portrait of Pope Innocent X. He
returned to London for lunch with the Sutherlands at The White
Tower, and Graham agreed to follow Francis's path to the sun in
Monte Carlo, where Eric Hall had been lured to stay with his lover.
Once the Sutherlands had arrived, they were introduced to Hall
and to gambling, which Graham called *the painter's vice' and found a
revelation of character. *When one should be bold, for instance, one
is timid,' he said. 'When one should be timid, one
is bold.' Francis
Bacon was always bold
at the green table, and he took his friend
painting not far from Vence, where the dried grasses and rocks of an
arid river bed suggested the spines and thorns of some of their later
pictures. On another trip, Graham travelled out with Lucian Freud,
continuing
the
exodus
from
Fitzrovia,
while
Freud
symbolically
released caged birds from hotel windows all the way to the South.
Sutherland
longed
to
meet
the
greater
figures
of Provence,
something Bacon did not try to do. He met Matisse once and Picasso
often. He was commissioned by Somerset Maugham
to
paint
a
portrait, which pleased the sitter although it made him look to others
like a Shanghai brothel-keeper. Sutherland now deserted his British
and neo-Romantic
influences
for
the more
brilliant colours and
definitions of the Mediterranean sun. He abandoned landscapes for
still lives and a new lightness and brilliance of colour, acid pink and
mauve, orange and
scarlet, emerald and chrome yellow. He used
organic
fragments,
shells and
roots and
gourds and
thorns,
the
ominous pieces of nature. Still praised by Douglas Cooper, who was
then
living with
the
art
critic
and
biographer
of
Picasso, John
Richardson, Sutherland began to lose the esteem which had put him
second only
to Henry Moore and
far superior
to Francis Bacon,
whose desperate work was increasingly held to cast a malign presence
over many of Sutherland's canvases.
John
Richardson was
the
witness
to
the
deterioration
of the
relationship between the two painters, which he held to be crucial
for
Sutherland, whose post-War
success
lay
in
his
imitation
of
Bacon.
In
spite
of his kind manner and
early help
to Bacon by
introducing patrons to him, Sutherland seemed to Richardson deeply

A Commendable Prodigality
107
jealous of the
rival painter and
a
sly man.
*I had every reason to
despise Graham/ he said. 'He did what he could to keep Francis a
secret from his friends.' It was useless as a tactic, for Francis was far
more socially aware than Graham Sutherland ever could be. In fact,
when Richardson
fell
out with Cooper and moved on and was
blacklisted by him as the enemy everywhere, only Sutherland took
the anathema seriously enough
to run
to the other side of Bond
Street at the sight of him.
'My work is like a diary,' Picasso told Richardson. To understand
it, you have to see how it mirrors my life.' Bacon's work was also like
a diary and mirrored his
life and loves, although
it was transmuted
by
his
particular
retention
of images and
anguish
of mind. He
returned
with
Eric
Hall from
the
south
of France
to
a
dismal
London. There he met again the demobiUsed Patrick White, before
he fled the depressed city back to Australia, selling his huge Bacon
desk and the chairs and glass table, which he had bought from R. A.
Butler. To White it seemed:
Those who had
spent
the war
in London
did
not appear
so
conscious of the graveyard it had become for a revenant like myself
dropping in from another world. Sometimes the actual graves of
those who had died in times of peace
still surrounded the crater
where
a church had
stood.
I was
less obsessed by the material
particulars of death than by its infinity haunting the ruins of once
stately houses or an expanse of street from which a comparatively
humble terrace had vanished. Friends I failed to trace and my own
memories of the blitz added to the feeling that death
still hovered
over the city I had known
.
.
.
Another determining factor was hunger.
In London
after the
war
it was
almost
impossible
to
feel
fed,
anyway
for
a
gross
character like myself At the mercy of a ration book and a pair of
scissors, you cast about in your mind
for something to
fill your
belly. Even bread was on points, everything devoured long before
the
cheaper
restaurants
opened
with
their
often
nauseating
offerings.
Fitzrovia had
largely
lost
its charms,
its
regulars
like Alan Ross
finding
it a dead and seedy place now, peopled by hangers-on and
time-wasters. There was rationing, but no reconstruction. The vast

1 08
Francis Bacon
bomb crater where St. Ann's Church had been opposite the French
Pub was a stagnant pool, fringed with reeds and weeds, where used
condoms floated like toy yachts. Yet wartime Fitzrovia was preserved
artificially by the squalor of peace, even if the soldiers and the sailors
and the airmen from
far places no longer passed through in their
transient lust and generosity. A central London of vice and crime
had sprung up
in
the post-War years with
prostitutes
lining the
streets more frequendy than lamp-posts and a red-light district of a
square mile in the back-streets, crowded with the
illegal drinking-
clubs that were a hangover from the War. London was
full of the
bored and the lonely, looking for purpose or jobs, and they congre-
gated in the basement clubs to bemoan the cut of their demob suits
-
*a
sort of never-never land of clipped moustaches,
army-style
overcoats and
old
school
ties. They were
suffering
a post-War
weariness from which many never recovered.'
New elements thronged the pubs of Fitzrovia,
also looking
for
business opportunities. To the demobilised were added the black
marketeers and the
'spivs', who shaded into the criminal class
in
their striped suits with padded shoulders, Brylcreemed hair under
fedora hats, and yellow shoes as pointed as daggers. They thrived on
the inadequacy of the supply system. They could provide
scarce
goods at the right price from unknown sources, and they became the
symbols,
necessities and
scapegoats
of their
age,
just
as
a
few
notorious murders and murderers
such
as
the con-man
Neville
Heath seemed to represent the suppressed violence of the peace.
This was also particularly caught in the resdess and seedy novels of
the
alcoholic
genius,
Patrick
Hamilton, whose
recording
of the
perverse gentility of the saloon bar appealed to the taste of Francis
Bacon.
The real personalities of the post-War years, as Alan Ross knew,
were those Vho in an age of rules, broke them'. Their names were
a catalogue of deviance and crime: Max Intrator, Sidney Stanley,
and the serial killer Neville Heath, who spoke of his murders almost
as Bacon did of his paintings:
'I got excited and
it went too
far.'
They echoed 'the shabby world of forged cheques, travelling restric-
tions and
export
permits;
of pathological
sexual
obsessions and
murder. The 'forties lived largely "under the counter": economically.

A Commendable Prodigality
109
sexually and
histrionically. Overt sexual exhibitionism gave way to
isolated acts of great violence.' The most sinister and inexplicable
of the Soho murders was connected with the
rise in vice and the
beginning of the decline in the area. Freddie Mills had been a boxing
champion and was found shot to death in his motor-car outside the
Chinese restaurant which he owned in Soho. He was a member of a
ring of practising homosexuals, and blackmail was thought to be the
motive.
Homosexuality was
still a crime in England. Even before the trial
of Oscar Wilde,
the area around
Piccadilly had a long history of
supplying youths
for
pederasts, some
of whom were
wealthy
or
prominent in society. The law compelled gay artists and aristocrats
to consort with criminals to satisfy sexual needs. Legislation to allow
homosexual
acts between consenting adults was
still twenty years
away, but already the Fitzroy Tavern was becoming a gay rendez-
vous, while the Golden Lion near the French Pub was always of that
persuasion, as was the Newman Arms. John Lehmann's In the Purely
Pagan Sense disguised the names of the gay pubs and clubs, calling
them the Broody Goose and the Alcibiades, but he attested to their
prevalence after the War, filled with boxers, actors, businessmen and
journalists. Eventually, the Fitzroy Tavern was to be raided in the
'fifties, and
its proprietor, Charles
Allchild, accused of running a
disorderly house. Incredibly, he was acquitted in spite of accusations
by the counsel for the prosecution that the pub was a meeting-place
for obvious male homosexuals and
sailors,
soldiers and marines.
'There can be very
little doubt that this house was conducted in a
most disorderly and disgusting fashion,' the prosecutor said. 'These
perverts were simply overrunning the place, behaving in a scandalous
manner and attempting to seduce members of the Forces.'
The transition of the Fitzroy Tavern, however, from the beacon
of bohemia in the 'thirties to a sexual encounter parlour in the post-
war
years, was
a slow process. The
regulars
hardly noticed
the
changes over the years.
Fitzrovia had always tolerated
all
sorts of
behaviour. Prostitution and homosexuality were nothing new under
the black-out or the lamp-light. What was new was their concen-
tration in certain pubs and their overtness. In the War, open sexual
behaviour had been permitted in the belief that the boys were having

no
Francis Bacon
a good time before going back to camp or to die abroad. And there
was the bombing. Danger allowed licence. But in what came to be
called 'The Age of Austerity' after the War, the parade of sex in the
pubs and the clubs and the streets seemed like flaunting it unnecess-
arily.
Although London
might
have become
the
vice
capital
of
Europe, performances were best left behind doors.
Such an atmosphere of clandestine perversity, a life of avoidance
of the eye of authority, stimulated Francis Bacon into other painting
portraits of protest and rage
at the restrictions of existence within
any society. From the
last
six years of the
'forties, only fifteen of
Bacon's
works
survive
because
of
his
fierce
self-criticism
and
destruction of his canvases. He was not yet bound by an obligation
to a gallery to produce a set number of pictures each year, and he
lived splendidly and squalidly on the margins of the metropolis for
the rest of the decade. During the ten months before his
first sole
exhibition at the Hanover Gallery, which opened in the November
of 1949, he produced seven paintings including
five variations on
^Heads', a series or commentary on his progress and his life. He told
John Russell that his break-through into his own vision came from
'the imperious character of the day-dreams' he had been having at
the time. Russell commented on Bacon's split nature, his gregarious-
ness contrasted
to
his
solitary contemplation cut off from human
contact, when he spent much of the day sprawling and dreaming,
'like a big cat in a cage'. When he sprang up,
it was with an incisive
light tread and quick glance beyond the trap of the studio walls, as if
something would come in reach of his claws, so he could catch
it.
He lived in a 'state of animal readiness'.
The first of Bacon's 'Heads', painted in 1948, is jerked back as if
ready for execution. The teeth are barren crops in the oval O of the
mouth. The
fl^sh seems diseased and the background melts and
disintegrates. The second 'Head' has emerged from parted curtains:
it
is a man and beast, spouting a
fall of slime. The paint
is
thick,
layer encrusted on layer.
It was one of the rare paintings that Bacon
worked on and pulled through over many months. The fourth 'Head'
shows a man's back dissolving into his ape reflection, while over the
parted curtains, the thin lines of a cage or trap are
faintly drawn.
The image was taken from a safari photograph of a man looking at a

small monkey, which Bacon transmuted into a version of the missing
link. But by the sixth 'Head', a cube encloses the screaming papal
figure, while the top of the head disappears into the curtains behind,
and
a
tassel hangs where the brain should be. The shape
is now
dressed
in
white
lace
and
a
robe
of purple
and
ultramarine,
suggesting a caricature of Velazquez's portrait of Pope Innocent X,
which Bacon had only seen in reproduction, not bothering to view
the
original on his one brief visit to Rome - a
city he had loved
although he had found Naples more exciting and better for work.
Captive and monster, the sixth 'Head' protests and devours: his
holy office is snare and threat. He is held in a skeletal cube that is a
dead
loss,
a boxed
hell without escape. The picture
assaults
the
power of the Church: it is blasphemous. It represents Bacon's heresy
and protests against the rule of the organised reUgion which he had
known in Ireland. He told a shocked reporter that his 'Heads' were
'an attempt to make a certain type of feeling visual'. The feeling was
his own fear of mortality and rage against authority. 'Painting is the
pattern of one's own nervous system being projected on the canvas.'
Unlike Velazquez, however, he had used the unprimed surface of the
cloth to make his 'Heads' harder and ugHer. 'One of the problems',
he
said,
'is
to
paint
like
Velazquez,
but with
the
texture
of a
hippopotamus skin.' The raw canvas was clogged with paint, almost
soiled, and yet
it was imprisoned behind plate
glass and
set in a
heavy frame of burnished gold, the howling beast within the gilded
gaol.
What Bacon had done was to transmute the state portrait into the
unguarded snapshot. Each figure was isolated in claustrophobia in
a
sealed
space, caught unawares and
in
crisis.
'While Velazquez
portrayed
the Pope
ex
cathedra^ Bacon
captured him
in
camera.''
Talking to the perceptive critic Hugh Davies, Bacon expressed his
admiration
for Velazquez compared with Cezanne, whose
'apples
are more intense than his people. His power of invention in forming
an apple has never gone into his forming of human beings, he tends
to make them inanimate objects, he doesn't extend his invention into
the psyche of the human being. Yet
if you look at Velazquez,
his
greatness
is his interest in people
.
.
. Velazquez came to the human
situation and made
it good and heroic and wasn't bombastic. He

112
Francis Bacon
turned to a literal situation and made an image of it, both fact and
image
at
the same
time. The Pope
is
like
Egyptian
art;
factual,
powerfully formal and unlocks valves of sensation
at
all
different
levels.'
The exhibition of the ^Heads'
at the Hanover Gallery provoked
outrage and recognition. The Arts Council bought the sixth 'Head'
and variations on
it w^ould become known as Bacon's
style for the
next eight years. 'His lacerated and tortured beings seem to be partly
living on this earth and partly withdrawn into a shadowland of death,'
the
critic of Studio wrote, 'or
is
it just ghasdy premonition.^'
It was
not mere sensationalism. For those strong enough to stand the shock,
the show was
'a mental and emotional experience'. In the last issue
of Horizon^
the
critic
Robert
Melville
gave
Bacon
his
overdue
accolade. He found that the 'Heads' recalled Dostoevsky and Kafka
in literature; but in terms of visual association, the parallels came
from the silent cinema, particularly that of Eisenstein and Bunuel's
Un Chien Andalou, which 'has greater visual force and lucidity than
anything achieved in the art of painting between the two wars, and
only
the
recent
paintings
of Francis
Bacon
have
discovered
a
comparable means of disclosing the human condition'. These had
an
air of extreme hazard. Bacon was probably the only important
contemporary painter who was exclusively preoccupied with man.
Bacon never makes a drawing. He
starts a picture with a loaded
one-inch brush of the kind that ironmongers stock, and almost the
entire work
is painted with such brushes. In these broad brush-
strokes, modernism has found its skin: the 'works' no longer show.
It isn't, of course, a simple matter of doing Cubism over again
with
thick brushes
instead
of thin
ones.
In
releasing modern
painting from the machinery of linear construction. Bacon makes a
typically baroque statement: he gives reality to an illusion, and his
pictures do not invite the spectator to investigate the means.
The
hole
of
a
screaming mouth
is sometimes
the
point
of
deepest recession in these pictures; or a litde white arrow floats in
front of the canvas and the
rest of the picture
starts
at a depth
which the eye judges to be behind the canvas; the canvas
is thus
rendered non-existent. But nothing can enter Bacon's pictures and
remain abstract, and a small thing - an arrow or a safety pin -
is
anything but unassuming in a world of large, undetailed forms.
It

A Commendable Prodigality

is like a fly in a prison cell.
It assumes the proportions of a Visitor,
or a Familiar, or even a Warder. The
fact that nothing will be
discovered about it increases its reality
.
.
.
Bacon
is not making
it any easier to paint pictures. His known
works are few in number because he is compelled to destroy many
canvases. When he works on a canvas, intellect, feeling, automatism
and chance, in proportions which he will never be able to calculate
in advance, sometimes come
to an agreement. During the
last
twelve months these agreements have been more frequent; therein
lies a hope for painting.
Until
the
success
of
his show
at
the
Hanover
Gallery,
Bacon
continued to lead his hazardous and bohemian existence. He used
to quote two phrases in French, one from Madame du Deffand, 7/
n'y a quun malheur,
celui d'etre ne^ and the existentialist phrase, ^on
joue perdanf. He did not so much mean that the
ill fortune of being
born condemned him to misanthropy, but that life was a losing game,
which one had
to play
at
hazard. Gambling and running
illegal
games of chance were
still Bacon's main source of income, but he
was now given ten pounds a week and free champagne by Muriel
Belcher to bring rich patrons and friends to her Colony Room, a
drinking club upstairs in Dean Street in Soho with a licence to serve
alcohol when the pubs were closed.
'It was possible
to
live on
it,
almost,' Bacon said later, 'before the pound went to confetti.' Muriel
was a formidable lesbian, who claimed to be the heir in hospitality
and repartee of the ancient Rosa Lewis of the Cavendish Hotel,
where the rich paid the
bills of the poor young men she fancied.
Muriel referred to most men as 'Her' or 'Cunty' or 'Miss Hitler';
they were summoned to pay with the command, 'Open your bead
bag, Lottie,' and closing time was announced with a reference to the
gay slang for public pick-up urinals, 'Back to your lovely cottages.'
Muriel was a past mistress
at the English
art of making insults
appear to be wit. Her clients enjoyed humiliation from her rough
tongue. Along with Bacon, other painters and writers used the oasis
of the Colony Room and left their impressions of that spiky watering-
hole with its faded leopard-skin stools and bamboo bar. To Elizabeth
Smart,
its
clientele was composed
of
'painters,
writers,
tinkers,
tailors,
sailors,
editors,
art
editors,
cartoonists,
singers,
African

114
Francis Bacon
chiefs, burglars, strippers, composers, dress-designers, lords, land-
owners, barrow-boys, advertising people, and unclassifiable people.'
When Bacon ran into a young artist there, who asked him to come
and see his own work because he so much admired Bacon's pictures,
the older artist put him down, saying,
*I don't need to see yours -
I've seen your
tie.' To the chronicler of London street-life, Colin
Maclnnes, Muriel's was Mabel's in England, Half-English:
And what of Mabel's place? Mabel's a character often met with in
films and
fiction, but oh! so rarely in
reality: the platinum-tough
girl with a heart of gold. Sharp, hard, ruthless and aggressive, she's
generous, forgiving, considerate, and rather shy. Quite ignorant of
the inner operations of the professional worlds of all her members,
she can nevertheless assess, with uncanny accuracy, their intrinsic
talents and current reputations. In appearance she's a
belle laide,
bulky and perpetually radiant. Her conversation's witty and
sal-
acious, her capacity for absorbing spirits without ill-effect appar-
endy limidess. She's always glad to see you ('Sweetie! Come and
kiss mother! You're a cup of tea'), and just as glad, when the time
comes to tot the takings, to see you go.
Of course, the spell of the drinking club is pardy morbid. To sit
in Mabel's place with the
curtains drawn
at 4 pm on
a sunny
afternoon, sipping expensive poison and gossiping one's life away,
has the futile fascination of forbidden fruit: the heady intoxication
of a bogus Baudelairian romantic evil. As the gins slip down your
throat, and the dim electrics shine on the potted plants and on
Mabel's lurid colour scheme of emerald green and gold, you feel
like
the
fish
in
the
tank
above
the
cash-register - swimming
aimlessly among
artificial water-weeds, mindless in warm water.
The pub, drear though
it may be,
is certainly more bracing -
it
offers none of the spurious comforts of this infantile hankering for
the womb
.
.
.
John Minton also left a sketch in words of the Colony Room:
'It was
always night at Mabel's. Mabel stood an enormous matriarch behind
the bar: you could get credit from her but it usually cost you a good
deal one way and another: as the night went on her look would get a
litde more
glazed, but she never
faltered. "Purely medicinal" she
would say, knocking back another double brandy which was chased
up on your credit
.
.
. Being at Mabel's was like being in an enormous

A Commendable Prodigality
115
bed, with
drinks.' In the opinion of one of Minton's old
friends,
Minton was
a liberation to Bacon. John, continually painting the
sailors he had been to bed with the night before, released Francis
from
all
sorts of reticences.
It was
a kind of sexual and
artistic
regeneration. Under Minton's wing in the
'forties, he managed to
get rid of his inhibitions and behave quite freely.'
Late at night, the Soho artists met at David Tennant's night-club,
the Gargoyle, where a lift no bigger than an upended coffin cranked
and creaked with visitors up to the main room. The room had been
suggested by Matisse himself, and eighteenth-century French mir-
rors had been cut into thousands of square wall tiles, which glittered,
imperfect and
awry,
to
entering
eyes. Bacon
did
not go
to
the
Gargoyle until the War was over, and would arrive, like most of the
other guests, half drunk but admiring. *But they looked for a moment
like birds of paradise coming down
this beautiful gold and
silver
staircase
into what
the
multiplicity of mirrors made
into
a very
beautiful room. I've never been a great admirer of Matisse, but this
room really worked as a setting.'
John Minton first brought Bacon to the club in the days when his
jealousy of Bacon's growing reputation had not yet driven them apart
as
it had
in the
case of Graham Sutherland.
It was,
in Bacon's
opinion, the place for rows. 'They were nightly. They went on not
only
for hours,
they went on
for
days.
It was
like one of those
instalments where
it says tomorrow you'll get such and such - well,
you certainly did in the Gargoyle.
It was great fun, really, in spite of
the rows.' Bacon met Sartre there, with Simone de Beauvoir and
Sonia
Orwell,
the poet George Barker and
the
painter Rodrigo
Moynihan, later a close friend, and Henrietta Law, the wife of a film
director whom Bacon used as a model, along with Muriel Belcher
and Isabel Rawsthorne, twice married to leading British composers.
Cyril
Connolly went
there
a
great
deal,
but Bacon
found him
profoundly unsympathetic. 'He approached you always as though he
wanted
to be wounded, which
is
a
horrible way of approaching
people. You only had to see his whole furtive look.' And Bacon never
even found the ageing enfant terrible, Brian Howard, at all witty. Wit
was a rare thing,
'a very acerbic commentary on behaviour'. There

1 1
6
Francis Bacon
was more wit on one hair of Bacon's paintbrush than in all the saliva
on Howard's loose tongue.
The Gargoyle housed the residue of post-War bohemia, where
the
aristocrats and
the
artists,
the privileged and
the
patronised,
would meet and
drop
the
barriers
of
class,
particularly
if their
homosexuality forced them into a clandestine security at a place that
did not consider their preferences to be criminal
acts. One
night.
Bacon and Minton and Lucian Freud offended James Pope-Hen-
nessy, the Literary Editor of the
Spectator^ who had brought in
a
couple of his paratrooper Vough trade' boys. When they emerged
from
the
rickety
lift,
the
paratroopers
set on
the
artists.
Freud
jumped on the back of one of the bully boys, while Bacon kicked at
his shins in a lady-like way. There were threats of legal action, which
were dropped for fear of homosexual exposure. On another occasion.
Bacon took John Rothenstein there and they were accosted by two
fellow-guests with truculent demands
for whisky. These were the
Scottish
homosexual
painters,
the
two
Roberts, MacBryde
and
Colquhoun, whose self-destruction through drink and destruction of
his own art was deplored by Bacon. Colquhoun was doomed and
damned by 'his gradual enslavement to a constrictive
style', lacking
the crucial part played by impulse and sheer chance.
The most intriguing description of Bacon's bohemian
life
at the
time was given by Michael Wishart,
a talented and beautiful and
spoilt young
artist. He had begun his sexual experiences early: he
was,
as
he
said,
the
precocious boy who
never grew young. A
German pilot knocked down in the blitz, now a prisoner of war, was
his
first encounter with the enemy, as Bacon had had in Berlin.
'I
prefer not even to know my partner's name,' Wishart wrote, 'while
sharing no language
is
a
positive
boon'.
It had been
the young
German's missi6n to destroy him, but they made a private truce of
the flesh. After the War, Wishart spent his adolescence on the floor
of Lucian Freud's flat in London and in the Soho clubs, particularly
the Gargoyle. Freud introduced him to Peter Watson, the patron of
the arts with 'his haunted beauty'. Wishart went to Paris with Freud
and
fell in love with Peter Watson's dangerous and drug-addicted
beloved, Denham
Fonts, and ended by sharing
his opium pipe-
dreams and
his bed. Escaping
to London before he became an

A Commendable Prodigality
117
addict and before Fouts died in a lavatory in Rome, Wishart met, in
a Soho pub
a
striking young man, who resembled David's
self-
portrait in the Louvre or pictures of the youthful Beethoven.
I was struck by the intensity of his gaze:
it was as though he had
X-ray eyes.
I succumbed at once to his romantic charm, which was
allied to a caustic wit. This was actually a creative intelligence. A
true visionary, he plunged the dagger of thought deep
into the
ridiculous sorrows
of existence and
twisted
it. The
funnier he
became, the stronger was the sense of tears welling up behind his
eyeballs. Within the same sentence he could pursue an idea into
the darkest comers of human endurance and withdraw with an
observation
as
hilarious
as
it was
tragic.
I had not met Francis
Bacon before.
Bacon took the young painter back to his studio in Cromwell Place.
He was very poor at the time, but he always managed to offer his
guests enormous dry Martinis in Waterford tumblers under the dim
glow of two huge
glass chandeliers. The shabby chintz and velvet
furnishings gave the old billiard room of the studio of Millais ^an
air of diminished grandeur,
a certain forlorn sense of Edwardian
splendour in retreat'.
It reflected Bacon's youth in the great houses
of Ireland and his liking for Belle Epoque hotels in Monte Carlo,
the seedy glamour of a fading casino. Then the nanny
still sat in a
rocking-chair at her knitting or slept on the kitchen table, looking
forward
to putting up
a gibbet again
at Marble Arch, where
the
Duchess of Windsor would be the
first to be hanged, drawn and
quartered. And the gaming parties continued, at which Bacon lived
by chance and the spinning wheel. Wishart also met Bacon's lover
and patron, Eric Hall. He appeared to be rather a philistine, plump
and balding and not quite a gendeman, but obsessed with Bacon; a
lover who bought the pictures to have the body.
Seated on the edge of the bath, Wishart used
to watch Bacon
make
up
his
face
before
he
went
out.
'He
applied
the
basic
foundation with lightning dexterity born of long practice. He was
more careful, even sparing, with the rouge. For his hair he had a
selection of Kiwi boot polishes in various browns. He blended these
on the back of his hand, selecting a tone appropriate for the particular

1 1
8
Francis Bacon
evening, and brushed them through his abundant hair with a shoe
brush. He polished his teeth with Vim. He looked remarkably young
even before this alchemy.' He even used cosmetic on his face as if it
were the canvas, while he was painting. John Richardson watched
him
in action
in
his
studio. *As he rehearsed
his revolving brush
strokes, he'd
let his beard grow for three days, and he'd cover his
stubble with sweeps ofMax Factor pancake make-up as if duplicating
on the bristle on his cheeks the brush-strokes on the rough side of
the canvas. He acted out his pictures in skin pigment on his face.'
Bacon
yielded
his
young
friends
and
lovers
with
grace
and
generosity. He was asked
to loan some money
to another young
painter, Anne
Dunn,
whose
background was
international
cafe
society. He sent the loan round to St. John's Wood in the hand of
Michael Wishart. 'She opened the door like a spinster expecting a
rapist:
it was on the chain.
I saw a tightly bandaged wrist.
I
fell in
love with the bandage on sight, and very soon afterwards with the
wearer, when we were
dancing
at
the
Gargoyle.' The wedding
reception was
held
in
Bacon's
studio. Two hundred
bottles
of
Bollinger were bought for two-hundred guests, but more cases had
to be
ordered because
of the crush and
the
thirst of the
gate-
crashers.
'Francis
astonished
everyone by painting
his two
large
chandeliers crimson, and
his face a more
delicate colour
.
.
. For
three nights and two days we danced.' David Tennant brought in
the clientele of the Gargoyle and Muriel Belcher all the members of
the Colony Room. Tennant said that the prolonged ruby-lit bacchan-
ale was the
first real party since the War.
It ended with a two-day
regatta
hosted by Bacon's good
friends,
Richard Chopping and
Dennis Wirth-Miller,
at Wivenhoe
in
Essex, where
later Bacon
would stay in the pub and paint and eventually himself buy a cottage.
Bacon presented the young couple with all his family's collection of
Waterford glass, although he kept a few china plates with the Bacon
crest on them. And
so the marriage
celebrations and the
'forties
were concluded through the commendable
prodigality of Francis
Bacon.
As Wishart told Lady Caroline Blackwood, Bacon had two major
ambitions - to be one of the world's best painters as well as one
of the world's leading alcoholics. While most people found these

A Commendable Prodigality
119
ambitions were contradictory and self-defeating, Bacon was to pull
both off At the age of eighteen, she had first seen the artist when he
was committing one of his rare acts of outrageousness.
It was at a
party given by Ann Lady Rothermere, who was to become Mrs Ian
Fleming.
Princess Margaret was
the
guest of honour, wearing
a
crinoline with wooden hoops and singing Cole Porter songs accom-
panied by the band, while the amazed audience stopped dancing to
listen to this impromptu royal performance. Suddenly at the back of
the ballroom, the sound of a rumbling was heard which increased to
a hullabaloo. Princess Margaret faltered in the middle of 'Let's Do
It', turned
scarlet and
fled. Lady Caroline asked
a gentleman
in
white tie and tails who had committed this act of loud treason. She
heard that it was a dreadful man called Francis Bacon, who painted
frightful pictures and should never have been allowed inside. Much
later, when she was married to Lucian Freud, she asked Bacon how
he had dared
to cause
that
scandal. 'Her singing was
really too
awful,' he
said. 'Someone had
to
stop
her.
I
don't think people
should perform if they can't do
it properly.'

And Shew 'd Us It
Bacon, like Moses, led us forth at last,
The barren wilderness he past,
Did on the very border stand
Of the blest promis'd land.
And from the mountain's top of his exalted wit
Saw it himself, and shew'd us it
.
.
.
The work he did we ought to admire
And were unjust if we should more require

From Cowley's 'Ode to the Royal
Society', the preface to Thomas Sprat's
History ofthe Royal Society (London,
1 667)
Encountering Francis Bacon in a bar, the polymath Michael Ayrton
found himself rebuked for accusing his fellow artist of not being able
to draw. Ayrton stuck by his statement. Bacon looked
at him and
asked, *Is drawing what you
do.'^' pausing to add,
*I wouldn't want to
do that.'
Ayrton felt that he was reduced to being a mere draughtsman.
It
was a palpable hit. Bacon's claim was legitimate. For him, the act of
drawing was ^part of the act of painting and in no way separate'. He
made a fierce and daring attack on form when he painted. He could
not prepare
for that by drawing. Even Bacon's inspiration for his
series of popes
in the
early
'fifties, Velazquez, must have drawn
directly in paint because so few of his sketches have survived.
Bacon
is
extraordinarily
intelligent but he
is
a gambler whose
appetite for chance plays upon the insecurity of his sense of form.
That a human hand
is
a
structure
totally incomparable
to
*the

122
Francis Bacon
lamprey,
which
hath
no bone
in
it',
concerns
him
very
little
compared
to
the
sensation of a human presence. He seems
to
encounter flesh agglutinated haphazard on
gristle rather than on
bone. Unfortunately for me,
I need the bones so that the flesh he
thrusts and
twists
to such powerful
effect
is held
in tension by
some internal scaffolding and this requires a deep comprehension
of structure which he disdains
to
establish below the neck. He
understands and can gamble on the human head as no artist since
Picasso has understood
it. Indeed
it
is a measure of his mastery
that he
alone,
since
Picasso, can
totally
disorientate
the
formal
elements
which
comprise
a
portrait
head,
without
losing
the
likeness. By comparison he represents
the human hand
as
if
it
were ectoplasm as incapable of holding a brush or a papal bull as
his heads are capable of holding the character of the sitter and the
attention of the spectator.
Ayrton went on to characterise Bacon as a formidable artist whose
paraphrase could transfigure
its source. The
series of portraits of
Velazquez's Tope Innocent X' introduced an element of dislocation
from
the primary
image, which was
to
have
great
influence
on
modern
art. Although Bacon claimed
that he had never seen the
original
in Rome, Ayrton had. He had noticed
that, when
it was
hung in the Palazzo Doria, the portrait was seen through open doors
and mirrors, which distorted the brass rails that enclosed
it. Bacon
appeared to have seen a photograph of the Velazquez pope hanging
in
its proper place. 'The relationship between painted and photo-
graphed images has become
a principal source of that ambiguity,'
Ayrton commented,
'which
is
felt
to provide
the frisson
in much
contemporary art'. Bacon was involved with existing images, whether
ephemeral or not. He wanted to capture the formal with its veil and
mask down.
'I have always l^een interested in behaviour,' Bacon claimed, 'that
is in life, rather than in art'. His view directly opposed that of Oscar
Wilde, who put art before life. Bacon sought to capture in his art the
split second of animals in motion, of men grappling in lust, of people
in fright and politicians off their guard. That is why he was peculiarly
attracted to the series of photographs taken by the Victorian Ead-
weard Muybridge. They were
to Bacon, John Rothenstein wrote,
'what his breviary is to a priest'. These sequences of naked mammals

And Shew'd Us It
123
in motion provoked Bacon to paint some series of related scenes or
portraits that have the distorted immediacy of the string of snapshots
that may be taken out-of-focus in a modern passport photograph
machine
or seen
in
strobe Hghting on the Uve
stage. As Francis
Russell pointed out, Muybridge's photographs w^ere uncontaminated
by art. They were not shaped by consciousness or composition, as
modern photographers shape their pictures and call them art. Bacon
took from photography 'the
initial stance: the readiness to accept a
deformed or implausible image as true'. He gave back to photography
'its involuntary, uncalculated status'. One might say that Muybridge
and Bacon were the King Lears of their various works. They showed
unaccommodated man as the poor, bare, forked animal that he was.
Yet
finally Bacon was determined
to
excise
the
truth more than
Muybridge might show. As Bacon said, he would 'make the paint
speak louder than the story'.
Muybridge's series of pictures of naked men and women pursuing
ordinary acts were extraordinary in their revelations of actual bodies
in movement. Sometimes they were horrific as well as expository, as
in 'Amputee Walking with Crutches'; 'Legless Boy Climbing in and
out of Chair', which Bacon used in 1953 in his 'Study of Figure in a
Room',
capriciously
restoring
the
missing
legs; and
in
'Paralytic
Child Walking on All Fours (from Muybridge)' of 1961, the only
work of his that Bacon identified from
its photographic source and
abnormal motion. Sometimes the mobile carcass was distorted by
the force of the work as in 'Hod Carrier Climbing Ladder' and 'Man
Performing Standing Broad Jump', again used by Bacon for depict-
ing a naked man. Sometimes the limbs were blurred and awry in
incredible
effort
as
in 'Man Performing Forward Handspring' or
'Man Heaving 75 -LB Boulder', once more Bacon's source in 1951
for his 'Study for Nude'. This
last painting particularly illustrated
Bacon's
remark
recorded
in
the
catalogue
of The Nerv
Decade
exhibition of 1955, of how shapes were 'remade or put slighdy out
of focus to bring in their memory traces ... as the snail leaves
its
slime'.
In the paintings derived from Muybridge's 'Men Wresding', where
one naked man pins another and
falls on his protruding buttocks,
Bacon saw the images of aggressive homosexuality and used them to

124
Francis Bacon
produce paintings that mocked the moral codes and subverted the
criminal law of the time. That he was not prosecuted for them as
D. H. Lawrence had been
thirty years before was a tribute
to the
changing climate of post-War London. But when Bacon was later
accused of refusing to help the gay militance of the early 'nineties,
with
his
usual
disdain
for
explanation
or
justification,
he
never
referred to his bold declaration of forty years back. Some of his more
prurient critics, however, knew exacdy what he was portraying. As
Mark Roskill wrote mArt International on the use Bacon had made
of Muybridge's 'Men Wrestling'
in his version, named 'Two Fig-
ures', of men making love fiercely on a bed, Whereas the imagery of
the source connoted
athleticism and muscularity
in their virtuous
senses - man at the peak of his physical powers, exercising himself
in sport for the sake of his physique - the connotations of Bacon's
image involve nudity in the shameful sense, and homosexuality
.
.
.
The Bacon has the force of the comment: "This
is what nudity and
the locked posture really ^r^."
The 'Two Figures' of 1953 was given
to or bought by Lucian
Freud and was not exhibited until four years later, when
it was put
on loan to the Tate Gallery.
It provoked no threat of legal action,
although sexual intercourse between men would remain a crime until
the
'sixties. When writing
later about David Hockney's candour
about his homosexuality, Robert Hughes declared that he was the
first to do
it in a garrulous, social way, as if it was the most natural
thing in the world. He contrasted
it to Francis Bacon using
it as a
pretext for reflection on the power of Eros to maim and dominate.
He did not point out that Bacon grew up under a criminal law, which
had the power to maim and dominate practising homosexuals, who
had to rely on Eros to continue to love other men. After his student
youth,
Hockney
did
not
have
to
fear
prosecution
for
sodomy,
although Bacon did until he was in his sixties. Thus his transmuta-
tions of Muybridge's 'Men Wrestiing', which he called 'Two Figures'
and 'Study from the Human Figure' and 'Two Figures in the Grass',
were acts of defiance of the social system as well as expressions of
his inner drives. They were painted in smudges so that the images
of the copulating men seemed a fusion of the
flesh rather than a

And Shew 'd Us It
125
sexual
act;
but
all
the
same,
they were
a
reckless
defiance
of
convention that risked ostracism or even prosecution.
In
this
experimental
period, Bacon was
to make
use
of other
photographs from Muybridge's Animals in Motion and snapshots of
Africa, where he went in the winter of 1950 to visit his mother, who
had gone out to stay with his elder sister lanthe, now married to a
farmer and
a hunter. They were both
to remain out
there, and
Bacon's mother would marry twice more, as her mother had - a Mr
Montgomery and a Mr Mavor. Her son was carried by the Orient
Line, on
the
first of three voyages
that he would make
to
the
southern
continent
during
the
decade,
as he was
not
the most
oblivious son in the world, and he represented the family trust in
England. One of the directors of the Orient Line had become his
patron, the wealthy and stingy Robert Heber-Percy, who travelled
first-class while Bacon travelled steerage - 'far more fun', he later
commented, 'among
the
stokers'. On
his voyage,
the white
iron
railings of the old liners with their poHshed wooden tops would have
given, with their oblong definitions, a restraint and a cage
to the
violence of the living sea and the chaotic wake. His mother and sister
had retired to escape the rigours of rationing in England and had
left the youngest member of the family, Winifred, to live in a home
for incurables
in Putney, where Francis was
to
see her with
his
cousin, Pamela Firth, now married to the war hero Popski, who had
once had his own Private Army.
On his visits to South Africa, Bacon always studied the wild
life
in
the Kruger National
Park:
he was
fascinated by
the
strength
and camouflage of the animals in their natural environment,
their
merging and their ease through the harsh bush, their deception and
elusiveness.
'I
felt and memorized', he wrote to Erica Brausen, 'the
excitement of seeing animals move through long grass.' He was even
taken by the outrageous excess of post-colonial society on the farms,
the drinking and the adultery, the riding and the cheap black help -
a caricature of the Ireland he had known
as
a
child. He became
fascinated and friendly with Karen Blixen and found her unsparing
view
of Rhodesian
life
in
Out
of Africa
as
terminally
honest
as
anything he tried to do in painting. Africa and
its sights remained a
concern of his, not only for his mother's sake, but for its merciless

126
Francis Bacon
images. He took a great many photographs of wild animals himself.
Their actual muscular movement had much to do with the structure
of things he wanted
to
do. They were
stronger than
the
things
Muybridge had done on movement in humans and animals. What he
wished to capture was 'the fact itself and nothing else'. He wanted
his paintings to have 'the same immediate effect of an animal after
the kiir, as recorded in his photographs and those of others. As late
as
1975, he would do portraits of Peter Beard,
a young American
traveller and photographer of Africa, who had repeatedly risked his
life
in
his pursuit of capturing on
film the beautiful abandon of
animals leaping.
On his
first voyage
to Africa, however, Bacon travelled back to
England without his protector and patron. He abandoned Robert
Heber-Percy
in
a
bar
in
Salisbury
in
Southern
Rhodesia, now
Zimbabwe, leaving with a transient and friendlier black man.
'I have
left Robert and have practically no money,' he wrote back to Erica
Brausen, asking her for an advance of fifty pounds. He found the
countryside
'too
marvellous
...
a continuous
Renoir
landscape',
while the Rhodesian police were 'too sexy' with their 'well-starched
shorts and highly polished leggings.' He
felt twenty years younger
and wanted
to take a cargo boat at Beira in Mozambique
for the
Suez Canal to see the antiquities of the ancient Pharaohs and then
to
sail on
to
Marseilles on
his way home.
In Cairo
the
painter
discovered a passion for the heads of early Egyptian art, particularly
that of the Pharaoh Akhnaton, from which he later made a study.
Returning to London, where he soon had to leave his Kensington
studio because he could not bear to stay there after the death of his
beloved nanny, he continued to develop his series of popes from the
screaming and mutilated head - topped like an egg - of the first one
he had painted in a cage.
Bacon once
said
to David
Sylvester that he could not separate
what he derived from Muybridge from what he owed to Michelan-
gelo, or indeed Velazquez. 'Actually, Michelangelo and Muybridge
are mked up in my mind together.' He learned about positions from
Muybridge, about the grandeur of form from Michelangelo and the
voluptuous male nude. This combination can be seen in his 'Study
of a Nude', finished in 1953, which
is ampUfied from a Muybridge

And Shew 'd Us It
1 27
of a man preparing to make a standing jump. For his popes, Bacon
used photographs not only of the Velazquez
portrait, but
also of
Pope Pius XII being carried through the Vatican in his sedia gestatoria^
a-flutter with white peacock feathers. A cross between mockery and
reverence, between satire and tradition, these popes
still flaunt and
howl and gibber at us in their robes on the outiines of their yellow
papal thrones.
Bacon used to deny that the apparent agony of his figures was
meaningful. 'Rembrandt unlocks the values of feeling, but he doesn't
necessarily say anything specific' His open mouths were no more
particular in their aspect than those described by William Gerhardi,
who said
that, seen at a distance, the hole of the mouth might be
screaming or yawning,
laughing or begging
for water,
talking or
sneezing. Yet to the critics of the pope series. Bacon had invented a
new form of painting experience, that of a man in increasing pain, as
if under torture. 'Bacon places the Pope in a chair that has been
wired to the mains,' one observer wrote,
'in the second picture the
current has come on, and in the third His Holiness
is in the
last
extremes of agonized
galvanization.' Another
critic saw Bacon
as
audacious enough to try for a continuous cinematic impression. 'He
combines the monumentality of the great art of the past with the
"modernity" of a film strip,' an experiment not to be repeated until
ten years later by Andy Warhol in his 'Edith Scull, 36 Times'. Bacon
was using the
stills of human motion to comment on the processes
of the human condition.
Bacon thought that what man wanted from generation to gener-
ation was
'to reinvent the ways that appearance can be made and
brought back into his nervous system more violendy, more immedi-
ately'. What had been made before had 'already become an absorbed
solution. So every generation needs to reinvent appearance.' That is
what Bacon was succeeding in doing in his experiments with paint
and transmutations from photographs in the
'fifties, especially in his
series of popes. Later, he would regret the impudence and disdain
of his all-out attack on papal infallibility. He would say that he never
got the scream vibrant enough.
It was not really what he wanted at
all.
In
the human mouth, he had wished
to
paint
the
beautiful

128
Francis Bacon
colours of a Turner as well as a Monet, but all he had achieved was
a black scream.
In a way, the great pope of Velazquez was such a masterpiece that
there was nothing to be done. He had tried to do something about
it, something even further, but it was impossible. Yet at the time, he
was obsessed by his subject, and he admitted that he was expressing
his
revolt from
the
authority of his dead
father and
constricted
childhood. 'He was the dandy of existentialism,'
as
the
art
critic
Lawrence Gowing called him, and there was no question that his
locking
of
his
figures
in
isolated,
enclosed,
windowless
space
reflected Camus in L Ttranger and Sartre in Huis
Clos. Hell was in
this black vacuum, and
it was human.
Bacon could accept the most dangerous
alliance of
all,
that of
novelty with history. The difficult thing, he said, was 'to keep open
the line to ancestral European painting while producing something
that comes across as entirely new'. Yet he would force fresh oils into
old bottles. He had joined the painterly formula which Velazquez
had
inherited from
Titian and Raphael
to
the
creation of pho-
tography
in
the
nineteenth
century. Yet twenty years
on. Bacon
would
declare
his
paintings
of the Pope
'a
great
failure.
I was
hypnotized at the time by the sheer beauty of it.' His paintings 'were
overstatements, too obvious and too cheap'.
In spite of such denials, these images of the howling or leering
Pope remained as ikons of the protest against authority that was to
emerge
in Britain during the Suez
crisis of 1956 and lead
to the
youth rebellion of the following decade. Apolitical and working from
his subconscious in his transfiguration of images that his conscious-
ness sought out. Bacon was expressing by intuition the social feelings
of his time. He always maintained that he painted only for himself,
but
his
serial themes represented
the
pictures locked within
the
minds of millions that were screaming to be let out. In his portraits
of homosexual
encounters and popes under
assault of the
early
'fifties.
Bacon
was
the
unwitting
prophet
of impending
revolt.
Another series of executives dressed in business suits, making useless
speeches and gesturing within solitary glass cages and imprisoning
darkness, demonstrated that Bacon's painting reflected the futility of

And Shew 'd Us It
129
the politics that would soon lead to an attack on the Establishment
of his country.
Out of Muybridge's Animals in Motion^ particularly his sequence
of his dog 'Dread
Trotting*, and
out of photographs of African
animals from Marius Maxwell's book of 1924, Stalking Big Game
with a Camera in EquatorialAfrica, Bacon now constructed an unusual
sequence of wild
life. He looked at animal pictures
all the time, he
said, because the movements of the species were continually linked
- also their appearances, as his head of a man merging into a baboon
had already showed. His interest in monkeys stemmed from the fact
that like humans they were fascinated with their own image. 'Their
interest
in themselves
is
displayed with an abandon and
a
relish
rarely equalled by that of man.' On one occasion, when his friendly
and proprietorial
critic David Sylvester was
sitting for him for his
series of popes. Bacon ignored his subject and preferred to paint the
head of a rhinoceros from
a photograph. He never explained
to
Sylvester whether this was a direct reference to the critic's character,
a joke or an act of imperious immediacy. He said merely that the
animal's texture engaged his interest.
Certainly, Bacon mixed the human with the animal kingdom as
much
as he
did Michelangelo with Muybridge. He might have
quoted William Blake whom he was shordy to paint in a series of
portraits.
And am
I not,
A fly like thee.^
And art thou not
A man like me?
Bacon's
'Study of a Dog'
of 1952
and
'Landscape',
showing
a
rhinoceros in outiine in long grass by a coastal road with cars like
the one near Monte Carlo, were characterised by a picture of an
elephant fording a stream, painted after a second trip to Africa that
same
year, and two more of dogs. The
British Council had put
pressure on him for further canine pictures for his exhibition in the
British Pavilion
at the Venice Biennale of 1954, where he under-
studied Ben Nicholson and partnered Lucian Freud. There were

130
Francis Bacon
other pictures of a baboon howling with bared teeth, and paintings
of a chimpanzee and owls. Yet the most intriguing was his portrayal
of *Man with Dog', which was surprisingly inscribed on the back of
the stretcher, 'Bacon - the Elephant'. A drain-cover and a kerb now
replaced the strong grille pattern that had trapped his previous dog
studies. This picture did not wholly derive from Muybridge's mastiff,
but also from Balla's Futurist painting, 'Leash in Motion', which had
recendy been exhibited
at the Tate Gallery. John Rothenstein has
described how Bacon would
go
to
exhibitions
and
concentrate
fiercely on a few paintings, ignoring all the rest of them. In this case,
Bacon took away
Balla's idea of only showing the
legs of a man
taking his dog for a walk, but he did not suggest the movement of
the dog in a succession of serial images, as
if Muybridge's mastiff
were superimposed upon
itself severally. This
is what
Balla had
done, based on Marey's chronophotographs, while Bacon chose to
slur and smear the single image of the dog, so that
it resembled the
blurred early pictures of beasts in motion. As in his comments on
Duchamp's famous 'Nude Descending a Staircase', Bacon tried to
make his beings more dramatic in their stepping out, while Duchamp
wanted
to
keep movement
central. He
did
not want
to make
something mechanistic, a mere motor moving down stairs. He tried
to cancel out
all implications. 'He was the
first of this century to
attempt that. Seurat did the same thing - as they say in America, to
keep it cool.'
It was not in Bacon's nature to keep anything cool, particularly not
the live animal. He explored the dynamics of the moving picture to
break the
static work of
art. When
his
exhibition of his African
pictures caused a sensation at the Hanover Gallery, he told a Time
magazine
reporter
that
real
imagination was
technical. He was
searching for the technique
'to trap the object at a given moment.
Then the technique and the object became inseparable. The object
is the technique and the technique
is the object.' Out of Africa as
well, he brought back the image of the Sphinx, which he set like his
popes and dogs, on a grid or within a glass cage. These were his
only four representations of a recognisable statue of a mythological
creature of mystery within his paintings, although he was
later to
resurrect that cat-like and sibylline shape to illustrate Muriel Belcher

And Shem'd Us It
131
of the Colony Room as the Oracle of Soho. By that time, his wit had
overcome his reverence for antiquity, and he show^ed us
it.
Also experimental in his vv^ork in the
'fifties w^ere Bacon's tributes
to two artists and writers that he admired, WiUiam Blake and Vincent
Van Gogh. J. S. Deville had done a plaster cast of Blake's face in
1823, and
a young German composer, Gerard Schiirmann, took
Bacon to see
it in the National Portrait Gallery so that he could use
it to design
a cover
for a song cycle of Blake's poems. Working
intermittendy
at the Imperial Hotel
at Henley-on-Thames on an
allowance of fifteen pounds
a month from the Hanover
Gallery,
Bacon was to execute seven variations of the mask, two of which he
destroyed. While he did not admire Blake's painting, he was inspired
by his poems. As with Aeschylus and Shakespeare, the words were
translated
into images. The
five Blake
portraits
are
cerebral, not
bestial, as
if the mind of the poet had refined
all the
fat and flesh
from beneath
his
skin
to
leave
only
a rendering of
intellect,
as
blubber
is rendered into lamp
oil to give
light. Against their dark
background, the features are as detached and aloof as a pale kite in
a night
sky.
Later, Schurmann was
to write
a work called Seven
Studies of Francis Bacon, which was
first
to be performed
at
the
Dublin
Festival of Twentieth Century Music and pay homage
to
Bacon's youth in Ireland.
The distance was not kept by Bacon in his treatment ofVan Gogh.
He saw the artist on the road to the sun in the South of France. For
Bacon loved the force and immediacy of Van Gogh's letters as much
as the whirling incandescence of his art. A series of eight paintings
was based on a photograph of a self-portrait by Van Gogh and on
his 'The Painter on the Road to Tarascon', unfortunately destroyed
by
fire
in Germany
during
the Second World War. Van Gogh
becomes a wraith and a shadow on the blazing road under his straw
hat, a canvas on his back and a stick in his hand, the irreducible
minimum of the artist on a quest for the source of Hght. This subject
restored prime colours and richness back to Bacon's brush, which
depicts the traveller on the road in smooth and glowing strokes like
the spokes of brightness
that can break through sombre evening
clouds. Again the influence of Edvard Munch
is seen in Bacon's
work
in
a greater resonance of hue and the sweep of landscape.

132
Francis Bacon
although Bacon
still
searches
for
the
reality behind Van Gogh's
vision, not for the vision itself.
To his
critics, Bacon's splash into agitated Fauve colours was a
revelation. His w^ork began to be compared to de Kooning's *Women'
and
Nicolas
de
Stael's
landscapes.
'In
the Van Gogh
series',
Law^rence Alloway wrote, 'the paint got out of control as
it flooded
the surface which previously
it had only grazed,
like an outburst
from a gypsy violin after messages in Morse Code.' The restricted
colours of Bacon's palette were forever altered into more startiing
and primary hues. Alloway made another shrewd point when he
noticed in 1963 that Bacon's new paintings had the look not of black
and white but of colour photography, as
if he had moved with the
times as magazines went over to colour. This view supplemented
another observer's opinion that same year on the influence of the
actual photograph on Bacon. 'He
is the
first
artist really
to have
looked at photographs and to have accepted them on their own terms
rather as mechanized sketches or immutable chunks of the outside
world.' And not
all
the
critics approved of his
switch from
the
monochrome
to
the
full
range
of the
spectrum.
Denys
Sutton
referred to Bacon's love of roulette when he wrote that the artist was
evidendy aware of many of the limitations which marked his earlier
paintings. 'To use an analogy culled from the tables, he has staked
so much on the noir that the rouge has been left to take care of itself;
as a result the rouge has
rarely,
if ever, turned up. What
is more,
the significance of the noir (the image) has been lessened through
familiarity: once the initial impact is digested, one begins to question
and even to challenge the means with which it has been secured.'
Bacon was now painting over fifteen pictures annually, compared
with two a year in the previous decade. In 1953, he painted twenty-
four to supply his
first American solo exhibition
at the Durlacher
Brothers
Gallery,
also another one
at the Beaux Arts Gallery
in
London. He was
selling
his
pictures, and
galleries were making
demands on him, which deterred him from destroying what he had
done. He was
also accepting commissions
for private
portraits or
series
of paintings from
his
leading patrons,
especially from
the
wealthy Mr and Mrs R. J. Sainsbury. She
sat for him as a model
sporadically over a period of two-and-a-half years and was painted

And Shew 'd Us It
133
by him in eight studies, three of which
still survive in the Sainsbury
collection. He
was
initially
forced
on
the
Sainsburys
by
Erica
Brausen at the Hanover Gallery, who would not allow them to buy a
Giacometti without buying
as well three Bacons
at two-hundred
pounds apiece. Tou must encourage young artists,' she said, *even if
you put them in the basement.' The Sainsburys, however, became
converts and Bacon's foremost collectors.
The
first named portrait by Francis Bacon was of Lucian Freud
in 1951, a good likeness although the ambiguous pose of the figure
in a doorway was taken from a snapshot of Kafka as a young man,
reproduced in Max Brod's biography of him. Bacon's other portraits
bore anonymous
tides such
as 'Man Eating
a Leg of Chicken',
although it was taken from another press photograph of the Marquis
de Cuevas. The centrepiece of 'Three Studies of the Human Head'
resembled
a contemporary photograph
in
Time magazine
of the
Canadian Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent. It had not been planned
as a triptych: in fact, David Sylvester tried to sell what would become
the right-hand canvas to three dealers for sixty pounds only - and
failed. Seven studies of a 'Man in Blue' met in the Imperial Hotel at
Henley
depicted him
as an
interrogator
of the
style
of Senator
McCarthy; and 'Two Americans' looked like executives on
trial in
the
dock. His
portrait of his second cousin and
early supporter,
'Miss Diana Watson', was again mainly derived from a snapshot he
had taken of her nineteen years before at Byland Abbey in Yorkshire,
although she did
sit two or three times for him while he completed
it. His 'Study for the Human Body' had also been painted from a
photograph of his cousin Pamela's husband Popski, who tragically
died of a brain tumour in 1951, but was preserved for ever in his
characteristic hunched post caused by his loss of half of his arm.
Bacon also began to work on self-portraits, as if he wished at last to
analyse himself in paint, a show of introspection. He naturally would
not confess to the truth of his motive,
airily telling John Russell,
'I
couldn't think what on earth to do next, so
I thought, "Why not try
and do myself.^"'
This period of experimentation confirmed
Bacon's
use
of the
moving picture and the press reporter's action camera as the sources
for
his
inspiration.
In
1957, he
actually painted
a 'Study
for the

134
Francis Bacon
Nurse in the film Battleship Potemkin', in which she was stripped
naked in the smeared motion of trembling fright and seated within
the jaws of the
outline of a high-backed
chair. Only her scream
and her pince-nez suggested Eisenstein's original image during the
massacre on the Odessa Steps, while Bacon's transmutation of the
film
still recalled many of his nude and spread and howling figures
trapped within a frame of gold rather than silver nitrate. He based
her body on another Muybridge study of a Woman Sitting Down in
Chair and Drinking Tea'. But a more compelling influence lay in
one of his valued clippings of a shot of a crowd scattering in panic
across a square
in
St. Petersburg during the Russian Revolution.
*Not one of these hundreds of figures looks remotely like a conven-
tional
figure,' he
said
to John Rothenstein. *Each one, caught
in
violent motion, is stranger and at first sight less intelligible than one
could possibly have imagined
it.' He then indicated the shape of a
fugitive, off-balance and extended and angular. 'Could anything', he
asked,
'be more utterly unlike the conventional concept of a man
running.^'
The concentration on the form of the living creature, caught off-
guard and unaware, undermined the tradition of representation in
painting. To understand the animal
in movement. Bacon did not
study anatomy
as Stubbs
did,
dissecting
a horse
to
see how
its
muscles worked. He might haunt butchers' shops to scrutinise the
flayed carcasses of sheep and cattle; he might even see the tortured
creatures in the waxwork show of the atrocities of the concentration
camps on Oxford Street at the end of the Second World War; he
might examine the exhibits of murders and forensic science in the
Black Museum at Scotiand Yard; he might add arrows to point out
the grisly details ''in his paintings as Fabian of the Yard did to show
vital
clues
left behind by
villains.
But
these
excursions
into
the
entrails and agonies of living beings were not as essential as capturing
them in the gesture of private revelation,
in the confession of the
solitary act. The very nature of the press photograph or the grainy
film influenced his portrayals so much that he sometimes used sand
in his paint. 'The predominance of grey, the blurred texture of the
surface, the transitional postures of the figures, and the avoidance of

And Shew'd Us It
135
forms which would give his pictures a monumental, static character,'
Rothenstein wrote, 'all derive from the photograph.'
Deluged with images as we are in the modern age of electronics,
we must organise the information we record in order to understand
and use
it. But Bacon loved to live in a random form to contain his
intention. The rubbish dump of the studios which he changed so
frequendy now, after selling his refuge in Cromwell Place in 1951,
reflected the role of the fortunate glimpse in his choice of shapes in
his
creations.
Clippings
from
newspapers,
reproductions
of old
masters torn from art books, stained cloths and clothes and spattered
tins of paint, thumbed copies of Aeschylus and Euripides, Shake-
speare and Pascal, Montaigne and Baudelaire, Nietzsche and Dos-
toevsky. Van Gogh's Letters and Frazer's The Golden Bough, Yeats
and Ezra Pound, added to the litter of happenstance. As he would
say disarmingly of his clutter, 'These are my models and my subject
matter.' Bacon preferred reading poetry to novels 'because every-
thing is said so quickly'. Jean Cocteau was another of Bacon's literary
influences, but only in his highly selective way: he called Cocteau 'a
window-dresser who said something of genius, "Look all your Ufe in
a mirror and you will see Death working like bees in a glass hive."'
He told Michael Wishart that he wanted to paint himself thus. When
he
moved,
from
brief
stays
at
Carlyle
Studios
and
6
Beaufort
Gardens in South Kensington, to live for a few weeks in the same
houses as David Sylvester, at 9 Apollo Place and then at 19 Cromwell
Road, he took only a few books and photographs and paints with
him. He
also was moving from drapes and darkness and abstract
landscapes
to
the shock of contemporary designs
set against the
melt-down of the naked human figure. With an odd precision, he
began to include in his art electric light-bulbs and switches, safety-
razors and
umbrellas,
telephones and
cameras, wash-basins and
lavatory bowls, ash-trays and half-smoked cigarettes: the trivia of the
everyday, the shock of the ordinary object. There is no attempt as in
Leger or Man Ray or the Surrealists to turn the objet trouve into part
of a work of art.
It
is the thing itself That
is
its effect. And when
Bacon added arrows as if on road signs to indicate movement, this
was a practical direction to the viewer's eyes, not a witty comment
on the impossibility of painting flow on a still surface. The 'props' in

136
Francis Bacon
his pictures, as he
said,
*act as visual
rivets'. Bacon sought to trap
the odd truths of place and man, out of step.
And now he began to snare the strange truths of his own condition.
He had fallen seriously in love and it became obvious in his paintings
of copulating men.
*I can't paint for other people,' he
said,
'I can
only paint
to
excite
myself.'
It was
only chance
if
it worked
for
someone else. Yet
it was *true of all painters that their work
is very
much autobiographical'. He painted 'Two Figures' in the summer of
1953, when he was living in a rented cottage at Hurst near Henley-
on-Thames, next door to one occupied by his new grand passion,
Peter Lacey. A public-schoolboy from the middle classes, a fighter
pilot and a country gendeman with a slight endearing stammer, an
alcoholic and a bar pianist, Lacey represented those self-destructive
and dangerous
characters of Patrick Hamilton, who appealed
to
Bacon's love of damaged respectability and distorted fagades. John
Richardson characterised Lacey as
sadistic and bad
for Bacon,
a
demon
lover and
destroyer.
But
to
the
artist,
he
represented
a
dynamic of mascuHnity, 'the raw statement of movement' he found
in Muybridge and now in his own
life, so powerful that he could
paint it.
That was, however, on the occasions that he could paint
at
all
while
living near Lacey. At one time he wrote
to Erica Brausen,
from
the
Imperial
Hotel
at
Henley,
that he had
given up
any
new work and did not wish to show the old.
'I am not able to finish
any paintings
at the moment so will you please put off the exhibi-
tion.
I am
terribly sorry about
this but as you know these
things
happen with work.' He would let her have some paintings soon, 'but
please do not have a show of the things you have got in the gallery
of mine.
I think
it would be a great mistake to show them both for
you and for me. As you know I want to replace most of them when
I
can, also there have been too many shows of mine -
I am desperate
and completely broke and am going
to
try and
get
a
job
for
a
time.'
For Lacey, Bacon had painted his most uncharacteristic picture of
all, 'House
in Barbados' of 1952,
a mere copy of a photograph
executed under his new lover's instructions, although Eric Hall also
wintered in the West Indies.
It was genius in thrall to the conven-

And Shew'd Us It
137
tional. 'Two Figures', however, was followed by the more
explicit
'Two Figures in the Grass' of 1954, in which the lower male figure
has turned back his head to kiss the man thrusting down above him,
and the dry blades rear their spikes, and a surrounding fence impales
repeatedly. Bacon was then living in a block of flats off Sloane Street
and working in a studio at 28 Mallord Street in Chelsea, which had
been lent to him by the wealthy Honourable Michael Astor. More
and more, he was changing
places. He
could
not work
well
at
Mallord Street because there was too much brightness, and trees
waved in the wind through the skylight, creating ripples of shadows.
He created two of his surviving portraits of Lacey at the end of 1957.
In one of them, the naked man hunched in a
foetal position
lies
asleep, his head on a pillow, in the womb of an enveloping sofa. In
the other, he stares out in arrested motion from the corner of a seat,
framed by Bacon's usual linear perspectives, ready to spring forward.
Bacon likened his device
for sealing his figures within the out-
line of cubes to being in love. The suggestion of a cage made the
viewer see the image more clearly, reducing the space of the canvas
and giving the figure a greater impact. Bacon was not necessarily
enclosing the shape in
its own loneliness, 'But people go to bars to
be closer to each other,' he said. 'The frustration is that people can
never be close enough to each other. If you're in love you can't break
down the barriers of the skin.' Yet that is what he was trying to do in
the fused flesh of his depictions of homosexual love, although his
extraordinary 'Man with Head Wound' of 1955 suggested that the
barriers of the skull and of inhibition would only be broken open by
the exposure of the meat within.
A year
later, Peter Lacey took Bacon away from the South of
France
to
Tangier
in
Morocco.
There
the
painter
rented
an
apartment for the next three years and lived a louche existence with
hardly any painting done, except on
his return
visits
to London,
where he now had a small and cluttered studio on Prince of Wales
Drive in Battersea, in 9 Overstrand Mansions. He was now sharing
a flat with his friends Paul Danquah and Peter Pollock, also habitues
of Tangier. As Truman Capote wrote of the place, 'Virtually every
Tangerine
is ensconced there
for
at
least one,
if not
all, of four
reasons: the easy availability of drugs, lustful adolescent prostitutes,

138
Francis Bacon
tax loopholes, or because he is so undesirable no place north of Port
Said would let him out of the airport or off the ship.'
At that time, Paul and Janet Bowles were the catalysts and scribes
of the port city while William Burroughs was its manic and destruc-
tive genius and was writing of its inferno in The Naked Lunch. Bacon
regularly visited Bowles, w^ho admired the painter and his pictures.
'He was a man about to burst from internal pressures. Even with the
articulate description he gave me of his method of work, I was unable
to imagine for myself exacdy what happened as he painted.' Bowles
had as a protege a young Moroccan artist, Ahmed Yacoubi, and he
passed him on to Bacon who allowed him to
sit and learn
in
his
studio in the Casbah. There he watched like a cat. 'Ahmed and
I
had no common language,' Bacon remembered,
'but between my
limited Spanish and French and his very good Spanish, we were able
to talk a lot.' Bacon taught Yacoubi a viable technique and brought
him back a good quantity of Windsor and Newton oils from London,
as there were none in Tangier. Yacoubi progressed fast enough for
Bacon
to arrange
a show for him in the Hanover Gallery. When
Yacoubi was thrown into a Moroccan jail, in 1958, on the charge of
seducing a fourteen-year-old German boy, causing an exodus of the
Bowleses and many of the foreign homosexual community. Bacon
stayed on in Tangier with Lacey and supplied Yacoubi, in prison,
with canvases and food. He advised Bowles not to return until the
crack-down was over, writing that he should be careful for Yacoubi's
sake as well as his own. Burroughs was even more gloomy, writing
to his former lover, the Beat poet Allen Ginsberg, that Tangier was
finished. 'The Arab dogs
are upon
us. Many
a queen has been
dragged shrieking from the Parade, the Socco Chico, and lodged in
the
local
box where
sixty
sons
of Sodom now
languish.' The
prostitute
boys,
'''many beaten
to
a
pulp,
have
spelled
a
list
of
hundreds'.
So homophobia
had come
even
to
Tangier,
although
it was
sporadic and dependent on scandal. Yacoubi was soon released, the
old ways resumed. Bacon was living in an empty apartment beside
the Villa Muniria,
a well-kept place run by a Vietnamese woman,
said to have been a brothel madam in Saigon and certainly used to
the proclivities of her guest and neighbours. Bacon went gambling at

And Shew 'd Us It
139
the casino, particularly with the Beat poets like Gregory Corso on
their visits to Burroughs. They found that he looked young for his
age, with a spoiled tragic face. He told Ginsberg that he had 'once
been offered a gambling stake for allowing himself to be whipped,
with
a bonus
for every stroke
that drew blood. Bacon's painting
technique was what he called psychic representation, the face formed
as
if by accident in a whirl of feathery brush strokes.' He said De
Kooning was the greatest
artist in the United
States,
for bursting
through the abstract and planting an image on canvas.
Ginsberg thought
that Bacon painted
the way
that Burroughs
wrote.
*It was a sort of dangerous bullfight of the mind, where he
placed himself in acute psychic danger of uncovering some secret
that would destroy him. Burroughs had these unpublishable mad
routines about
talking
assholes, with
the
recurring image
of the
spurting hard-on as the hanged man's neck snaps, and vast paranoiac
theories of agents and psychic
senders
taking over
the world
in
bureaucratic conspiracies. But Burroughs, although fond of Bacon,
denied that there was any connection, and said, "Bacon and
I are at
opposite ends of the spectrum. He likes middle-aged truck drivers
and
I like young boys. He sneers at immortality and
I think
it's the
one thing of importance. Of course we're associated because of our
morbid subject matter."'
The two men also differed on drugs. Bacon could not smoke kif
because of his asthma. He also disliked
its
effect. Burroughs and
Bowles 'would smoke grass and just stop talking to each other'. At
least, drink 'up to a point gets you closer to people. You loosen up.'
Bowles
'liked marijuana and
I liked alcohol, and they create very
different worlds', so they never made much contact with each other.
Actually, Bacon did experiment with Paul Danquah with
kif, but
Bacon's face blew up like a balloon because of his asthma, and he
never tried it again.
Although Ginsberg once offended Bacon at Burroughs's room in
the Villa Muniria by offering him liquor in a tin can from the rubbish
bin - the
artist was afraid of getting typhoid - the poet wrote an
evocative description of him to Jack Kerouac, then on the road again
in America. He described Bacon as having the aspect of an English
schoolboy and
the
soul
of a
satyr. He
'wears
sneakers &
tight

1 40
Francis Bacon
dungarees and black silk shirts & always looks like going [to] tennis
... & paints mad gorillas in grey hotel rooms drest in evening dress
with deathly black umbrellas - said he would paint big pornographic
picture of me
.
.
.' Ginsberg was then trying to edit The Naked Lunch
into some form of final order, so he asked Bacon how he finished a
painting. The answer satisfied Ginsberg. 'He said he did
it with a
chance brush-stroke that locked
in the magic - a fortuitous thing
that he couldn't predict or orchestrate.'
The English poet Michael Horovitz also saw the affinities between
Burroughs and Bacon - *the savage, sometimes morbidly horrendous
vision,
cross-cut and scorched under
lightning-flashes of caustic
humour; flaiUng homoeroticism; ruthless destruction of failed exper-
iments as of cliched successes; the welcoming - and later nurturing
- of chance
operations'. But Bacon was
hardly
able
to
paint
in
Tangier in the same way that he had been incapable in Monte Carlo.
The
light seemed
to be
too
strong
or
the way of
life was
too
exhausting.
'Such
upsets! Rows and
getting thrown
out
of the
window!' So he told Cecil Beaton of his Ufe with Lacey there, when
he was trying to paint the portrait of the society photographer in
London. He had a tooth knocked out and his face was in an appalling
mess.
Bacon wrote confidentiy to Erica Brausen that he could paint in
Morocco, since he had installed himself in a sixth-floor apartment
on the Boulevard Mohammed V.
'I feel
full of work and believe
I
may do a few really good paintings now.' But he really wanted two-
hundred pounds to keep going with Lacey, and though he wrote that
he would come back with more than twenty pictures,
only three
appear to survive - one of a hooded Moroccan man carrying a child,
and another of a -papal figure in glasses with folded hands and two
owls perched on the back of his throne, and a third of the 'Landscape
near Malabata', in which shapes seem to melt off harsh grass into a
streaked
saucer and
a round
night. That same
stark barrenness
contained
in a bowl
is the background of Bacon's
third powerful
picture of copulating men of that decade, 'Figures in a Landscape'
of
1956
and
1957,
surely
the
truth
of
his
violent
and
erotic
relationship with Lacey running into a desert of despair in Morocco.
'Eroticism for Bacon', the perceptive critic Lorenza Trucchi has

And Shew'd Us It
141
written,
*is
a
total
act,
the extreme moment of truth.'
It was not
Bacon's task to alter or pervert reality by passing judgement. 'Utterly
genuine in their sensual, often secret, and solitary rage
.
.
. Bacon's
figures in any case perform a rite of exorcism, one of the last rites
granted to a man in his attempt to
forestall death and assert
life.'
Bacon knew that Lacey was destroying both of them by his alcoholic
excesses. The year of 1958 was fallow in the
artist's
life. Only six
surviving paintings were completed. The quarrels and scenes with
Lacey continued. It was the same when the two of them left Tangier
for summer holidays in England at a boarding-house in St.
Ives, a
painting community in its own right, but conveniendy near the sailors
who visited from Devonport. The young painter Patrick Procktor
had himself been a
sailor there, and when he visited the Cornish
boarding-house with Bryan Robertson, they found that naval mayhem
had preceded them, the aftermath of a visit by Lacey and Bacon.
'Oh,' the manager said,
'it was awful. There were so many sailors
falling off the
roof. We
can't go on with
this.' The painter Karl
Weschke also saw Bacon hurrying away down a Cornish street. He
caught up and saw Bacon's face was badly bruised. As
if he were
talking about his flogging by the Irish grooms in front of his father
when he was a lad. Bacon said of Lacey, 'When he's standing over
me with a whip, what else can I do?'
Yet Bacon had to go on painting and he would not give up Lacey.
He even completed from memory,
in
his room
at
3
Porthmeor
Studios at St. Ives, one portrait of a head of Muriel Belcher at the
Colony Room. Yet he found that he was still able to work in London
as long as he left Lacey to play the piano at Dean's Bar in Tangier.
His Hfe was changed in one way. He had inherited a position at the
Royal College of Art through the good graces ofJohn Minton, who
had gone for several months to the West Indies in the September of
1950. He had given his professor's salary for a term to Bacon, who
replaced him less as a tutor than as an honorary visitor. All he could
do was to go there for two days a week, he said, 'and if the students
wanted somebody
to
talk
to,
I was
there'. He thought those who
taught people at art schools were failures and taught their students
to be
failures
too. But he continued
to use
the
painter Rodrigo
Moynihan's studio at the Royal College of Art until 1953, when he

1 42
Francis Bacon
painted his last picture there, 'Study for a Portrait', of a businessman
sitting in the cube of a leather chair within an oblong box and frame.
This seemed
to Bacon
to
represent
the
constrictions
of formal
academic
life, and he only returned occasionally
to the Common
Room of the Royal
College, where
his
relationship with Minton
steadily deteriorated. Minton could not abide losing the supremacy
of his British reputation as an
artist, particularly as leading critics
such as David Sylvester championed Bacon and Giacometti at the
expense of their rivals. At one lecture by Sylvester on modem art at
the
Victoria and Albert Museum, Minton rose
to
his
feet
in an
outburst against Bacon, whom he accused of leading certain Euro-
pean traditions into a cul-de-sac, not of extending them.
Bacon's other champion was John Rothenstein, the Director of
the Tate Gallery, who had also been betrayed by the envious Graham
Sutherland, who
resigned
as
a Trustee of the Tate
as
a public
protest against Rothenstein's alleged maladministration of the gal-
lery. Rothenstein was
also
friendly with the shy and aged painter
Matthew Smith, and he recalled in 1952, what happened after they
ate a sedate dinner at the Athenaeum:
We wandered along the streets of Soho, he lamenting the drabness
of English
cafes and
places of amusement, when we suddenly
caught sight, framed in a
tall window,
sitting on a high stool, of
Francis Bacon. We joined him and he presendy swept us along
from bar to bar and club to club, eventually from the Colony to the
Gargoyle. The more Francis drank, the more physically helpless
his condition, the more marked his imperious dignity
.
.
.
It was a delight to be in the company of Matthew and Francis
together.
I never heard one praise - to his face - the painting of
the other, but their tacit assumption of mutual regard and affection
was manifest. Matthew used to say of the work of Francis that even
at
its
least
successful
it
never
lacked
absorbing
interest,
and
Francis, who
admires
the work of few
of his
contemporaries,
admires Matthew's with little qualification.
As a result of this mutual admiration, Rothenstein took his courage
in his hands and asked Bacon to write a tribute for the catalogue of
Matthew Smith's retrospective
exhibition
at the Tate. Bacon had

And Sherv'd Us It
143
never written a word for publication: his wit and knowledge of art
lay in his conversation. Yet he accepted,
as did the alcoholic and
retiring Henry Green, perhaps the greatest living English novelist of
that period. Green praised Smith for the sense of humour in his
work,
the
lushness
of
his
nudes
and
the
lyrical
poetry
of
his
landscapes, above
all Tor this torrent of beauty with which he has
endowed
mankind'. On
the
other hand. Bacon
praised
Smith's
technique with paint and his use of chance:
He seems to me to be one of the very few English painters since
Constable and Turner to be concerned with painting - that is, with
attempting to make idea and technique inseparable. Painting in
this sense tends towards
a complete
interlocking of image and
paint, so that the image is the paint and vice versa. Here the brush-
stroke creates the form and does not merely fill it in. Consequentiy,
every movement of the brush on the canvas alters the shape and
implications of the image. That is why real painting is a mysterious
and continuous struggle with chance - mysterious because the very
substance of the paint, when used in this way, can make such a
direct assault upon the nervous system; continuous because the
medium is so fluid and subtie that every change that is made loses
what is already there in the hope of making a fresh gain.
I think that painting today is pure intuition and luck and taking
advantage of what happens when you splash the stuff down, and in
this game of chance Matthew Smith seems to have the gods on his
side.
John Rothenstein also brought Bacon together with Henry Moore,
who thought of Bacon
as the best of living dramatic or romantic
figurative painters - hardly what Bacon thought of his own work.
Moore had doubts, however, of the possibility of creating enduring
art out of such ephemera as press photographs and film stills. They
would lose their force in time. Yet Rothenstein persisted in going
out with them a trots:
Henry and
Francis,
in
spite of their mutual
liking and
respect,
sometimes
treated
each
other
with
the
aggressive
caution
of
heavyweight boxers. The three of us went together one night to a
big reception at the Savoy, and Francis, attracted by some galaxy

144
Francis Bacon
or other which held no attraction for Henry, said, 'Let's go over
there.'
*I think', said Henry, 'that for a few minutes
I'll stay where
I
am,' and
Francis, whether
in
allusion
to
the
sobriety of our
friend's life or the consistency of his attitude as an artist
I do not
know, repHed, 'Where you are
is where you usually stay,
isn't
it,
Henry?' and he strode off into the crowd.
Rothenstein had met Bacon at a fashionable dance, where he was
very drunk and the only man not wearing evening dress. Yet his
command of every social
situation could not have been easier or
more complete. He made clear, with courtesy and authority, that his
interests lay in different worlds. In his early forties, 'he looked taller
than he was; his hair had the springy look of a boy's; his face was
full and rounded, sHghtly narrowing towards the forehead; his stride
was
long and
a
little
undulant,
his
voice
caressing with
just
a
perceptible undertone of menace'.
Rothenstein and Bacon then made a habit of spending an evening
together every few months. Bacon was a better host than a guest. As
a guest, he could not indulge his sudden cravings for the expensive
food or wine that he did not wish to demand, if invited. Hospitality
played a very important role in his life. He would talk about painting
in
a way that riveted the
attention,
as
a hazardous adventure,
far
more likely to end in disaster or a 'near-miss' than in success. He
admired
other
painters,
such
as Velazquez and Rembrandt and
Picasso, for their rare masterpieces.
'I hope the painter friends whom
I respect', he said to Rothenstein,
'will never know on \vqw few of
their pictures my respect depends'.
Bacon's Hfe was
as
original and audacious
as
his painting. He
could only reach his desires when his strong sense of purpose was
favoured by chance. He once told Rothenstein that no day passed
without his thinking of death - and he was preoccupied by chance.
In his company, anything might happen, but as a host, he was ready
for
it. At an evening party in the Hanover Gallery in March, 1957,
to celebrate the opening of one of his exhibitions there, Rothenstein
noticed:
The small rooms were densely crowded with
artists,
collectors,
students,
and
the
teddy-boys
with
exotic
haircuts
and
leather

And Sherv'd Us It
145
jackets (many of them very drunk), who mysteriously arrive as a
matter of course, and in considerable numbers, at any quasi-public
function of which Francis is the occasion. Above the noise a cry of
pain was suddenly thought faintly to be heard. Before anybody else
had even seen what caused
it, Francis had appeared,
instandy,
from the
far side of the turbulent room and was staunching a
wound. Some
object from
the balcony had
fallen upon
a man
below and laid open his scalp.
Because of his authority as a host people who might otherwise
have been apprehensive
at the presence of a number of drunk
toughs, moved among them without the sHghtest sign of disquiet.
What Rothenstein chiefly valued in Bacon as in Lucian Freud was
their complete sense of classlessness. They would as easily talk to
barrow boys as to the baronets, who sought their company - and
Rothenstein was himself given a knighthood, while Henry Moore
was made a Companion of Honour by the Queen and showered with
honorary degrees. Bacon had no time for that sort of recognition and
would refuse to be a Companion of Honour and a knight himself in
due time.
*It might be fine for other people,' he used to say, 'but
I
want to stress
I don't want anything for myself.' His chosen honours
were
to be with the few painters that he admired. He introduced
himself to Giacometti in a cafe in Paris and found a soulmate
in
method and
philosophy.
Giacometti was never
satisfied with
his
work. He also smashed or discarded most of what he did. He was
full of self-criticism and bleak humour.
*I have always
failed,' he
once said. 'But
I am sure no one can realise what he strives for! Oh,
to be able to say, "That's
it,
I cannot do more."' Visiting him in his
studio in Montparnasse to buy works for the Tate Gallery, Rothen-
stein found a clutter almost as messy as in Bacon's studio and an
artist ready to destroy anything that was admired. The only time that
his friends ever saw Giacometti smile was when he broke a leg and
fell
into
the
gutter
in Rome.
'At
last,' he
said,
'something has
happened to me.'
The influence of Giacometti can be seen in one of Bacon's more
unusual paintings, 'Fragment of a Crucifixion' of 1950. He grew to
dislike
it later, calling
it 'traditional story- telling'.
It showed a Cross
shaped like a T with a bestial shape crucified upon
it, imprisoned

146
Francis Bacon
within a spatial cage. Another ravening dog-like beast hung over the
crossbar, raging and slavering to rend the crucified being. Yet in the
background, figures as stick-like as those of Giacometti and cars in
oudine passed along a boulevard, indifferent to the crucifixion.
Its
restricted
colours of blue and
w^hite and black suggested photo-
graphic prints, while the movement lay in the figures and the cars
being rendered in slight blurring. Bacon declared later that he used
the crucifixion, not because he beHeved in
it, but as a myth which
made him feel many things.
'It was always dried up for me,' he said,
but in the end
it was to become 'impractical to even use
it.' Yet as
Bryan Robertson noticed, Giacometti's pivotal 'Hands Holding the
Void'
and
'The
Nose',
through
which
the
long
phallic
shape
extrudes, were
crucial
influences
in Bacon's
use
of the
abstract
space-frame. And curiously enough, beside Bacon's huge 'Painting,
1946' of the grinning shape under an open black umbrella in front
of a crucified hanging carcass, the curator of the Museum of Modern
Art
in New York has
set
a bronze of a
slinking
skeletal dog by
Giacometti, as abject and sinister as any Bacon.
Daniel Farson, the Soho photographer and author, watched the
rift as
it grew between Francis Bacon and Graham Sutherland and
did his best to heal
it. After falling out with Bacon, Douglas Cooper
also
bickered
with
Sutherland
in
the
South
of France. When
Sutherland made
the
mistake
of painting Cooper's
portrait,
his
subject was too vain and mean-spirited to appreciate the result. But
it was the increasing influence of Bacon which inadvertendy and
inescapably proved devastating to Sutherland, particularly his 'Christ
Carrying the
Cross', where the Saviour was kicked forward by
a
bloated and grinning soldier - a last-minute addition to his retro-
spective in the Xate Gallery in the May of 1953. Bacon was not to
have his first retrospective until two years later, and then only at the
avant-garde
Institute
of Contemporary
Arts.
Daniel
Farson saw
another Sutherland in a friend's house, commented that
it was an
odd Bacon, and was told that
it was a Sutherland. Art critics began
to point out that Sutherland's debt to Bacon was too blatant and
heavy. And as Bacon's international reputation soared above his own,
Sutherland added to his imitation in order to recapture his former
glory. Although Sutherland's biographer stated that he seemed to be

And Shew 'd Us It
1 47
painting Bacon-like works on a given theme
before Bacon himself
tackled it, the evidence of existing paintings and contemporary critics
is
that Sutherland
followed where Bacon's
originality
led - and
became jealous of him.
The close relationship and mutual admiration between Bacon and
Lucian Freud continued in Soho and elsewhere. They were both
reckless gamblers. In each case, they found deep satisfaction in being
beggared.
It drove them back
to brush and
paint. Both of them
found a sense of fulfilment in losing heavily. But Freud's painting,
so Bacon told Cecil Beaton, was losing some of its intensity in his
effort to paint quicker.
It was no longer a complete expression of
himself, and he was
in
the predicament of having
to
rediscover
himself. Yet his
intellectual brilliance, his complete independence
and strength as someone who knew exactiy what he wanted from
life made him deeply attractive
to Bacon, who shared these same
qualities with his friend.
Keith Vaughan was a mannered painter who recognised Bacon's
influence and power against the grain. In his journals, he attacked
Bacon's
*lack
of permanent
formal,
classical
values,
a
sort
of
deliberate
spiv-existentialist outiook on painting'. The portraits of
Lucian Freud
'hit a new low in banality'. Yet even this disapproval
could not stop Vaughan from recognising the imperious authority
which Rothenstein had noted in Bacon. A close friend of Vaughan's,
Dennis Williams, lived and worked in a small room near Bacon and
became so besotted that he was incapable of any independent action.
He
admired
Bacon's
impressive
dignity,
his
ardour and
natural
grace, his physical beauty that was supple and gende and sensuous,
and his view of people as mountains of flesh. Bacon was obsessed
*by this extraordinary capacity for flesh to breathe, walk,
talk'. And
Williams was obsessed by his own enslavement:
There was nothing I could do. He would lie in bed in the morning,
purple in the face, looking
ill - terrible - unable to move until he
had taken enough pills, but talking all the time about the paintings
he had dreamed of If I offered him a cup of tea he wouldn't drink
it. He
just didn't see me.
I could have been anyone else and he
wouldn't have noticed.
I was in his studio one day and he came in
with a suit which had just come from the cleaners. He laid
it down

1 48
Francis Bacon
on a large table in the middle of the room which was thick with
paint, cotton wool, bits of dirty paper. He
laid the
suit down on
top and said he had to go out for a moment. As the suit had just
come from the cleaners
I picked
it up and put
it on a hanger and
hung
it out of the way by the wall. My only reason for doing this
was
that
I thought
it would be
helpful -
a
small
thing - but
something he was incapable of doing for himself. Direcdy he came
back into the room, without saying a word, he went over to the
wall, took the suit down and laid
it again in the paint on the table.
I
feh
absolutely
shattered,
as though my personality had been
wiped out.
In his recent biography of Jeffrey Bernard, Graham Lord recalled
that Bacon took over from John Minton in his occasional support of
Bernard by slipping him the odd ten-pound note
to support
his
gambling habit, but Bernard always denied that the artist had tried
to seduce him. 'He preferred rough trade or very smart business-
men.' He advised Bernard on his philosophy of life, which wonder-
fully
impressed
the
elegant
scrounger.
'The
only way you
can
possibly survive is to regard everything as being totally unimportant.'
During a brief visit to New York for one of his exhibitions. Bacon
was
to save Bernard from freezing by purchasing an overcoat for
him, and giving him hundred-dollar bills and champagne breakfasts
at the Algonquin Hotel. And as age came upon them both, Bacon
was to show concern for his younger friend, saying, 'Now that you've
lost your looks, Jeffrey, what are you going to do.^'
Bacon moved
in
all
circles. In October,
1953, he went to Lady
Ann Fleming's party for the fiftieth birthday of Cyril Connolly. He
had met Cecil Beaton and Lucian Freud at Wheeler's fish restaurant
in Soho, and they proceeded to the Fleming party, where the other
guests included various peeresses and Maurice Bowra and Clarissa
Eden, the wife of the Foreign Secretary, Stephen Spender and the
philosopher Frederick Ayer, Sonia Orwell and Connolly himself.
Bacon presented Connolly, whom he disliked, with a pot of caviar,
while Beaton
fell into conversation with a lad of twenty-three and
asked
him why
Bacon
had
such
an
influence
on
the
younger
generation. The
reply was
that Picasso was
old-fashioned, while
Bacon had both
aesthetics and
sensitivity. Never before had any

And Shew 'd Us It
1 49
artist succeeded in breaking down
'all the rules and associations, a
revolution in accepted creeds and standards of painting'. Bacon was
the harbinger of the youth revolt to come.
It was also at Wheeler's that Bacon had shown his disdain for his
health to Lucian Freud and his wife, Lady Caroline Blackwood. He
came into the restaurant declaring that he had heard from his doctor
that his heart was in tatters and was hardly functioning. Rarely had
such a diseased organ ever been examined.
If he touched another
drink,
his
useless
heart would
fail. He then ordered
a
bottle of
champagne, and then another bottle and another. As he became
drunker, he was also more ebullient, while the Freuds grew more
depressed. They
took
the
diagnosis
seriously and
believed
that
Bacon would soon be dead, but then he went on drinking prodi-
giously
until
his
eighties and seemed not much the worse
for
it.
Although he was
afraid of death, he could not
treat
it
seriously
enough to stop himself drinking. At the
last
glass,
living well was
better even if it meant dying soon.
On his
visits to London,
Patrick White renewed his friendship
with Francis Bacon through Roy de Maistre, who introduced them
to the Director of the Whitehall Gallery, Bryan Robertson. He saw
'Roy acting as a kind of father figure to the much younger Francis,
often troubled by one or other of the three usual problems: health,
love, or money'. He would sit on the vast couch designed by Bacon,
still backed by one of the screens he had painted in the
'thirties.
Patrick White always regretted leaving in England the
large desk
created by Bacon. So he had a copy of it rebuilt for his Australian
home. Dogwoods. 'Had something of a reunion with Francis Bacon,
who has matured as a person,' White wrote in a letter in 1958, 'and
of course Roy de Maistre.
I have bought a crucifixion by Roy, quite
small, very beautiful
.
.
.' He also took back to Australia the memory
of Bacon's character, which he would flesh out in his later novel. The
Vivisector.
Bacon did not appeal to all writers and poets, especially the young
and the inhibited. Michael Hamburger was taken off to the Colony
Room by him, and there they met John Minton, Lucian Freud and a
variety of club members.
Francis Bacon ordered champagne and
expounded why 'artists have to become crooks'. In spite of the many

150
Francis Bacon
martinis Hamburger had drunk at the party, *my immediate response
was to freeze up. From that moment
I was a wet blanket.' He was
not surprised when Bacon, Minton and the Freuds decided to move
on
to another haunt, leaving him to
reflect on the tedium of the
setting -
*the
elderly barmaid with whom
the
guests exchanged
endearments and insults, the jazz being strummed in the background
by a Negro, the young artists trying to be younger than they are.'
John Minton was moving towards self-destruction as well as a rift
with
Francis Bacon. At
a party
at
his house
in Allen
Street he
insulted Bacon's paintings and Bacon poured the bottle of cham-
pagne he had brought over Minton's head and massaged
it into his
hair and said,
*I give champagne to my real friends, and real pain to
my sham
friends.' When Minton threw out one of his minions,
Bacon met the young man on the streets, gave him five pounds and
told him to get a meal at Wheeler's. Minton came into the restaurant
later with some sailors, followed by Bacon, who walked up to Minton
and asked him why he did not look after his back numbers. But
before taking his
life from alcohol and sleeping-pills in the January
of 1957, Minton saw much of Bacon, whose generosity to his friends
surpassed any love-hatred he may have felt for them.
Gerald Wilde was another Soho painter whom Bacon supported.
Also an alcoholic, Wilde,
in the
'forties, was considered by critics
such as David Sylvester to be Britain's leading abstract expressionist.
He once claimed that Bacon 'had ripped off his colours in the early
days', but Bacon treated him with the largesse he always bestowed.
Wilde's
glass would be
filled with champagne by Bacon
in
the
French Pub or the Colony Room, and Bacon would give Wilde five
pounds when
his
fellow
artist banged on
his
studio
door
after
midnight demanding money for drink.
Bacon met his women models in his Soho life. His evil genius was
the
malicious photographer John Deakin, who would
record
the
subjects which Bacon wished to paint - Muriel Belcher and Isabel
Rawsthorne and Henrietta Moraes. Bacon commissioned Deakin to
photograph Moraes naked, and he took her
in
erotic poses with
spread legs. But when Bacon painted her many years later from the
photographs, he turned her upside down and added a hypodermic
needle with bloodspots on the bedsheets.
It was before she took to

And Shew 'd Us It
151
drugs, and she thought him a prophet. He promised her a painting,
*but he didn't give me one, did he?' What Deakin did was to peddle
the nude photographs
to
sailors
in bars
for ten
shillings
a
shot.
Moraes never forgave him.
The Colony (or Calumny) Room was the afternoon drinking club
where Bacon went to meet his friends. When Farson asked him what
its appeal was, he replied:
'It was a place where we went to dissolve
our inhibitions.' Nobody felt guilty there. They were protected from
the law and the criminal code within. The jazz singer and art critic
George Melly declared that Bacon's portraits of Muriel Belcher had
ensured her immortality. 'She was a natural procurer,' the Soho poet
Paul Potts wrote of her, 'whether it be a Bacon for the eggs or a date
for the girl friend.' She also presides forever from her high stool in
an evocative early picture by the young painter Michael Andrews.
And another young painter, Michael Clarke, remembered gatecrash-
ing the
club
in order
to meet Francis Bacon, who
greeted him
warmly and offered him a drink, before he was thrown out. Yet he
noted as he descended the
stairs,
'this curious box outside, which
had several
left shoes in
it:
it reminded me of those
early Giotto
paintings with kind of space frame buildings, and Giacometti's space
frames, and, of course, the space frames that Francis uses
in his
paintings.' He became
a habitue and was
to paint the death-bed
portrait of Muriel Belcher.
'Wheeler's had particular panache in the
'fifties,' Farson wrote of
the restaurant at the time when he would lunch weekly there with
Bacon and other leading painters. They provided a sort of cabaret
and were
tolerated. Bacon could run up
a
bill, which he always
settled in the end, although Farson once had to sell one of Bacon's
screaming popes to a college friend for one-hundred-and-fifty pounds
in cash so that the
artist could settle his account. But in post-War
and rationed Britain, eating and drinking in Wheeler's was a luxury.
Farson described Bacon as talking in Mayfair cockney, in a whine
with a touch of self-mockery. 'I'm not the fool
I seem - Pas du tout,
cherie' He was always the host, signing for the oysters and Dover
sole and Chablis. His penury never prevented his hospitality.
Bacon did not join in the diaspora of many artists from Soho in
the 'fifties, because those who wished to survive had to flee or die of

152
Francis Bacon
drink and waste of talent. He met Dylan Thomas
in
a Soho bar
before the poet's death of alcoholism, but the encounter was a deadly
failure to the listeners. 'They both wanted to do the same thing -
talk.' Even Dylan fled to country life at Laugharne in Wales in order
to put off the slow Soho death by ten-thousand drinks. But Bacon's
flights to Tangier with Peter Lacey, who ended by playing the piano
and running Dean's Bar there, were even more self-destructive than
his
existence
in Soho. Yet his constitution was so strong that he
was able to rise again after any nocturnal excess. And he was the
antithesis of the Fitzrovian creed, a painter who survived success in
a society which preferred
failure. Even George Melly agreed that
flight was the only solution to Fitzrovian life. 'In the end there comes
a time when you must fight free or go under.' Most of the Fitzrovians
followed the
artists and dispersed after the War or worked for the
state.
If they wanted
to
live
long,
they went away and returned
infrequently.
As if to prove
its possibilities, from that ravaged ambience in the
'fifties emerged one radical genius, whose images have changed the
perception of this time. Francis Bacon was to triumph over decades
of a bohemian existence in London.
It helped him to achieve the
^reality' which he sought in his
art. For Bacon, the message of the
artist was
necessarily subversive,
also
his way of life.
'Artists
are
always disruptive,' he said, 'by their sense of reality they undermine
the whole structure around them. It's the look of reality - they break
the
chain.'
In
his caged Velazquez popes entrapped
in
terror, he
prophesied the plate-glass prison put around Eichmann at his trial in
Israel, but he said he had done
it only to cut down the scale of the
canvas and conoentrate the image by drawing in the rectangles. In
fact, he did
later see and cut out a photograph of the entrapped
Eichmann,
which
confirmed
his
previous
vision.
In
his
flayed
carcasses of men and meat of flesh, he has shovm the face of our
time, its torture and its violence, its horror and its waste of being. An
admirer of Ezra Pound, Bacon has supplied what the poet asked,
The age demands an image,
Of its accelerated grimace.

And Shew 'd Us It
153
And he knew profoundly what he was trying to do. As he told a
reporter from the Sunday Times, in 1957, before leaving to spend the
summer in Tangier, his object was nothing less than to paint, in his
own terms, ^the history of the last thirty years' - something he did
not always say about his work.
So radical, disruptive, seminal and real were Bacon's images, that
he would achieve what the Auden Communist group of the 'thirties
dreamed of: a major exhibition of pictures in Moscow, seen there as
revolutionary protests against religious authority and the destruction
of humankind.
*I was very much helped towards painting,' Bacon
was to write to the Soviet Government, 'after I saw Eisenstein's films
Strike and The Battleship Potemkin by their remarkable visual imagery.'
Eisenstein's pictures gave Bacon a form for his
'reality', which had
nothing to do with the dialectical materialism of scientific Marxism.
He
also was
to quote
to
the
Soviets
a
definition of painting by
Vincent Van Gogh: 'How to achieve such anomalies, such alterations
and refashionings of reality that what comes out of it are lies if you
like but lies that are more truth than literal truth.' 'Reality', to Bacon,
was created by technique and by the capture of chance. He searched
for concentration on certain human situations. 'Somewhere there's a
very hard rock, an
instinct.'
'Reality' was
'the tough roughness of
being. The painter's job is to make the images which return to reality
more violendy, if you're lucky.'
Bacon
refused
to
recognise
that
his
paintings had
achieved
a
Greek 'reality' that was the essence of the spirit of his age, although
he knew that he had achieved a communication to the people of his
era. This could not result only from technique and caught luck and
the violence of Bacon's own experience in Berlin in the 'twenties, in
Paris in the
'thirties, and in bohemian London during the War and
thereafter. His brutal way of living, amoral and disruptive, made him
an unlikely recipient for the
gift of conveying a universal message.
But Rimbaud
and,
indeed,
Shakespeare
had
also
received
that
improbable gift, when neither had the vocabulary nor the background
to compose
their imperishable verses, which are
still resonant for
any age or country. Bacon demonstrated that a Fitzrovian life might
provoke an artist into
fifty years of supreme creativity, while Dylan
Thomas remained the testimony to its morose fatalit}'.

154
Francis Bacon
'The
compelling power
of Bacon's
vision/ John
Rothenstein
wrote, 'once ridiculed as schoolboy obscenity, derogated as an affront
to decent people, and
so
forth, has imposed
itself on
the public
imagination, not only of Britain but of the western world.
In the
awkward strangeness of his
figures we recognize ourselves;
in his
"affronts to decent people" we recognize understatements about our
own age, the age of Auschwitz, Stalin, Hiroshima, Bangladesh, and
about much that goes on beneath - though not far beneath - the
surface of our own society. So completely, in
fact, has
it imposed
itself that
to some among the younger generation
it has become
almost commonplace. This untaught painter has become, by the
audacity of his vision, by his dedication, his rare understanding of
paint and its mysterious potentialities, a master.'
The recognition of Bacon's work internationally and his financial
security were arranged by a new contract with Marlborough Fine
Art
Limited,
to which he
switched on
17
October
1958. That
afternoon, he called at the Hanover Gallery and asked to see Erica
Brausen. To her secretary, he appeared agitated and disappointed to
hear that she was abroad. He wished to
tell her that his debts had
obliged him to leave the gallery. The situation was irrevocable. 'He
knows that you will be
distressed,
as he
is himself,' the secretary
wrote to Miss Brausen, 'but he says his position was desperate and
that he had no
alternative. [He was] obviously upset and in some
trepidation, bringing with him a cheque to clear his account ... He
said he would never have taken this step without consulting you but
was up to the neck in personal debt to the extent of about £5,000 for
gambling etcetera.'
Erica Brausen^was equally upset.
'I've looked after Mr Bacon's
interests
for more
than
ten
years,'
she
declared
to
the
press.
'I
bought his first picture. Now he leaves a message with my secretary
that he
is
taking
his
business
elsewhere.
I
intend
to
sue
him.
Admittedly, there has been only a verbal contract between us. But
I
have organized exhibitions for him in Paris and Milan.' The one at
the Galerie Rive Droite in the February of the previous year had,
indeed, launched Bacon's reputation in France. He had also been
commissioned through his cousin Diana Watson to paint the famous

And Shew *d Us It
155
cabaret director and diseuse, Suzy Solidor, herself the pupil of Yvette
Guilbert - so often painted by Toulouse-Lautrec.
With pretended indifference, Bacon refused to discuss his deser-
tion of Erica Brausen and
the Hanover
Gallery,
saying
that the
matter had been taken out of his hands. Marlborough Fine Art
declared that
it had signed an agreement with Bacon in good faith,
and that
its
solicitors would deal with the claims of the Hanover.
The
origins of the
rival London gallery lay in the Second World
War, when two
refugees
from Vienna,
Frank
Lloyd and
Harry
Fischer, met in the Pioneer Corps and decided to trade together,
when peace came, in art and antiques and rare books. They reached
Bond Street in 1950 and broke into the international art market with
the acquisition and sale of the last complete set of Degas bronzes,
one of which went to the Tate Gallery. Joined as a partner by David
Somerset, the present Duke of Beaufort, they gained access to the
major
art collections stored in EngUsh stately homes, which often
had to be sold to pay income tax and death duties. They also began
to represent contemporary artists, Henry Moore and Graham Suth-
erland
and now
Francis
Bacon.
As
Rothenstein
wrote
in
the
introduction to a Bacon show in Paris, ^The
artist paints and lives
his highly independent
life;
the Marlborough with no more than
minimal consultation with him pursues, on his behalf, a brilliantiy
successful career.'
His deal with Mammon at the Marlborough made Bacon preserve
more of his canvases for sale: there are
fifty surviving paintings of
his from the period of three years after 1959. His promotion by the
Marlborough even secured him a showing at the Kassel Documenta
that same year. And his powerful new allies increased the range of
his patrons. The Marlborough paid him in rolls of ten-pound notes,
with which he climbed through every stratum of society, playing the
wilful
host. 'He was
ruthlessly upwardly and downwardly
socially
mobile,' his friend Bruce Bernard said of him. *He wanted control
after all those early years of rejection. He wanted to dominate. It had
to be his choice. He had to show his power.'
Bacon appeared classless. He moved effortlessly through society
without
any
discrimination
except
his own
caprice. He
treated
Stephen Spender and a sailor on the same terms, although young

156
Francis Bacon
sailors were often treated better. He was
all things to
all men, up
and down the river. He went to dinner with Spender when the poet
gave a party for his old friend W. H. Auden, who had returned to
England from the United States of America to take up the Chair of
Poetry at Oxford. At the party were Lady Glenconner and Osbert
Sitwell, now dying of advanced Parkinson's disease, Sonia Orwell
and David Jones and Bacon. Unfortunately, Auden annoyed Bacon
by declaring that
a
friend of his, X, was
a crook. *He
just
isn't
straight about money, and
I
don't
approve.' Spender knew
that
Auden was right, but his dogmatic manner showed no realisation of
the
feelings of Francis. In his journals. Spender commented
that
after
an
argument,
Auden
'admitted
that
he
liked X
but
the
admission had the same
quality of filing X into some category of
approval or disapproval as the criticism.
It was really one of those
strangely unsatisfactory controversies between the prigs and the anti-
prigs, in which both sides are both in the right and in the wrong, one
through being very moralistic, the other amoralistic - and both being
so on principle.'
Bacon certainly cultivated a wealthy and artistic international set
of patrons, although he
dealt with them with
aristocratic
disdain.
Nothing illustrated his
flirtation with the beau monde and his con-
tempt of it more than the episode of Cecil Beaton's portrait. Beaton
had met Bacon in Tangier, which he called the 'oriental Chelten-
ham', while he wrote
that Bacon went there
for
'a close intimacy
with the Arab world, with the brothel life, and the freedom that can
be found only in certain Mediterranean countries where access to
women is difficult'. In spite of Bacon's reputation for destroying his
paintings,
Beaton
took Bacon's photograph and commissioned
a
portrait from the younger artist. He eagerly anticipated the sittings
in his studio. Trancis
is one of the most interesting, refreshing and
utterly beguiling people. He is wise and effervescent and an inspired
conversationalist.' Actually, according to Patrick Procktor, who also
did a sketch of Beaton and was ordered immediately to remove
it
from sight, there were long silences at the sessions with Bacon, only
interrupted by the painter saying, 'Well, don't you like coming out of
a black background.^'
Beaton admired Bacon's manner
at work. The
artist had
just

And Shew'd Us It
157
returned from a winter in Tangier, where he had been too harassed
and
ill
to
paint, but now he was
full of the
joy of London
life.
Unfortunately in the early months of 1958 he had a new and messy
studio
in
the
red-brick Overstrand Mansions
in
Battersea. The
ancient curtains were
livid and crusty from his habit of wiping his
paint-spattered hands on them. There he
set
to work among
a
Dostoevsky shambles of discarded tins and rags and newspapers on
an enormous rough canvas, covered with black paint, which he said
he would
cut down
to
size,
if necessary, when
the
portrait was
finished. He told the apprehensive Beaton, Tour face
is pink and
blue.
I can't make out if it is pink on top of blue or blue on top of
pink.'
Francis started
to work with great zest, excitedly running back-
wards and forwards to the canvas with gazelle -springing leaps -
much toe bouncing
.
.
. Smiling and painting simultaneously, he
seemed to be having such a good time. He appeared extraordinarily
healthy and cherubic, apple-shiny cheeks and the protruding lips
were lubricated with an unusual amount of saliva. His hair was
bleached by sun and other aids. His figure was incredibly lithe for
a person of his age and occupation, wonderfully muscular and
solid.
I was impressed with his 'principal boy' legs, tighdy encased
in
black
jeans
with
high
boots.
Not
a pound
of
extra
flesh
anywhere
.
.
.
Of his many qualities I admired most his independence.
I envied
his being able
to
live
in exacdy the way he wished, and
I was
impressed by his aloofness from the opinions of others. We went
out *on the town', but
I am not good at pubs, drinking clubs and
late hours and would fade away just when Francis was about to
enjoy himself
Bacon called a halt to the enterprise for two years, and when Beaton
asked him to go on with
it, he showed his sitter an enormous black
canvas, depicting a monster nude cripple with four legs and no head.
Bacon said he would try again to get a likeness, but this time on a
background of emerald green dye-paint. He worked
fluently and
talked incessantiy. Beaton noticed, among the rubbish of old cloths
and paint tins on the floor, two cosdy books on Crete and Egyptian
art, which Bacon profoundly admired for the beauty of the heads.

158
Francis Bacon
Occasionally Francis would
sit down on an old chair from which
the entrails were hanging and which had been temporarily covered
with a few French magazines and newspapers. His pose reminded
me of a portrait of Degas. He curved his head sideways and looked
at his canvas with a beautiful expression in his eyes. His plump,
marble-like hands were covered with blue-green paint. He said he
thought that painting portraits was the most interesting thing he
could ever hope to do: 'If only I can do them! The important thing
is to put a person down as he appears to your mind's eye. The
person must be there so that you can check up on reality - but not
be led by
it, not be
its
slave. To get the essence without being
positive about the
factual shapes -
that's
the
difficulty.
It's
so
difficult that it's almost impossible!'
When the portrait was finished, Bacon declared that
it was one of
the best things he had ever done. He
invited Beaton
to view
it.
Always vain about his appearance, Beaton saw a coloured cartoon of
a bald and senile businessman.
The face was hardly recognizable as a face for it was disintegrating
before your eyes, suffering from a severe case of elephantiasis: a
swollen mass of raw meat and
fatty tissues. The nose spread in
many directions like a polyp but sagged finally over one cheek. The
mouth looked like a painful boil about to burst. He wore a very
sketchily dabbed-in suit of lavender blue. The hands were clasped
and consisted of emerald green scratches
that resembled claws.
The dry painting of the body and hands was completely different
from
that of the
wet,
soggy head. The white background was
thickly painted with a house painter's brush.
It was dragged round
the outer surfaces v^thout any intention of cleaning up the shapes.
The head and shoulders were oudined in a streaky wet sUme.
e
Beaton could not hide his sense of shock and pain at this caricature
of him, so different from the flattering photographic portraits that he
took with his camera. Bacon offered him the picture for only three-
hundred pounds, while Beaton haggled for half the price. He simply
did not know where he could hang it among the beautiful decorations
of his home.
It would give him
'a turn for the worse' every time he
saw it. But it might be a good investment, and he could always sell
it
for more to the Marlborough Gallery. He gulped and said he would

And Shew 'd Us It
159
take it and staggered away with a great sense of loss. He had thought
that Bacon's theories of Hfe and art and beauty would be incorpo-
rated in the portrait, but the artist had seen him with a different eye,
the essence within.
Soon afterwards, Beaton had a telephone
call from the
ecstatic
Bacon, who told him that he had destroyed the portrait and most of
the
other
pictures with an emerald-green background
that were
scheduled for his next exhibition at the Marlborough. He did not
like his friends taking work that they did not
like. He wanted no
money from Beaton and did not mind wasting his time. 'He seemed
jubilant at not getting paid, at not finishing a picture.' When Beaton
told Augustus John of how Bacon had made him look like a piece
of raw offal, John replied that he deserved
it for sitting for Bacon
and added sarcastically, 'These idiosyncrasies are the prerogative of
genius.'
Actually, the prerogative of Bacon's genius were his dissections.
He took out of Beaton what he saw in him, and set that on canvas.
Beaton was the last man to see the flaws in his own nature, the vanity
that denied growing aged, the greed and commercial instinct that he
hid beneath his urbane wit, and the skull that certainly lay under the
last of his hair. Bacon was as ruthless in his depiction of his patrons
as he was in cultivating their presence. With all the charm and wit in
the world, he wielded a brush like a scalpel and pursued a visceral
truth. When Michael Wishart wanted him to paint Jean Cocteau and
arranged an introduction. Bacon would not do
it. 'Too much Hke
Cecil Beaton,' he said.

The Blood ofa British Man
Child Rowland to the dark tower came:
His word was still Tie, foh, and fum,
I smell the blood of a British man.'
Edgar in King Lear
by William Shakespeare
Like the wise Edgar pretending to play the Fool - Fie, Foh, and
Fum - Bacon was to smell the blood of two of his beloved British
men within ten years of their deaths. These tragedies both were to
occur at the moments of his triumphs, as though Edgar's father, the
old and faithful and blinded Gloucester in King Lear, knew of the
black truth of living:
As flies to wanton boys, are we to the gods;
They kill us for their sport.
Bacon often used to quote these Hues and admired Shakespeare for
his ability to enliven life, however futile
it was. He was full of deep
despair and pessimism as well as humour and an absolutely diabolical
cynicism.
Rich enough now to afford a permanent studio in London, Bacon
moved into 7 Reece Mews in Kensington, where he would
live in
the main for the rest of his life. From the outside, the house has the
look of a bunker, undistinguished and enclosed above the locked
double-doors of
its
garage. Yet Bacon was
always
influenced by
places and
sensitive
to
the atmosphere of rooms. The
cloistered

mews enabled him to work inside, and he knew that from die very
moment that die house agent brought him diere. The bell was kept
out of order so

did not have
to answer die door
to
salesmen or importunate
friends, but loud knocks from expected
visitors enabled them
to climb up a steep
flight of wooden
steps
holding on to a rope banister, which only allowed his large canvases
to inch up. Then the guests would discover an elementary kitchen
with a bath-tub by the cooker, a small studio on the right, and a bed
with a spread of a dazzling Moroccan tent cover in
a cabm of a
sitting-room on the left. 'It's radier like a ship, isn't it?' Bacon would

The floor and the walls were bare; naked light-bulbs hung from
the
ceilings, while heavy
curtains of dark green blocked
off the
windows, which Bacon eventually painted black. He had pulled down
the
studio
ceiling
to
expose
die
joists and
the
rafters and had
installed a grimy skylight to let some brightness falling from the au-
into die room, parked with the
clutter of the
artist. In die living
space
a huge wall-mirror webbed with cracks recalled Duchamp s
disturbing Large Glass, which Bacon diought took die problem of
abstraction and realism as far as it could go. Beside an electric fan a
cast of die deadi-mask of WiUiam Blake rested pale on die top of a
desk
littered widi books on
art, which were
usually bought
at
Zwemmer's in die Charing Cross Road - Bacon's favourite Eisen-
stein had also ordered his art books from diere. No pictures by odier
painters were hung, aldiough Bacon had once owned a very early
Frank Auerbach and had bought a Sickert of a woman lying on a
bed widi a man seated next to her. 'But,
like
a
fool,
I gave

Bacon was alsp to feel diis instant recognition of a place where he
might be himself when he found a single room in Pans which he
bought a few years later. He knew he could work in
it, aldiough he
admitted to David Sylvester diat his intentions in Paris were greater

was able to work there more easily 'dian in a city which

from alcoholism. Marlborough Fine Art was arranging more and
more exhibitions for him - a one-man show at the Sao Paolo Bienal,
a retrospective at the Richard Feigen Gallery in Chicago, and group
shows
in Amsterdam, Glasgow, Leningrad, Milan, Moscow, New
York, Nottingham, Paris, Pittsburgh, Turin and Wakefield. His work
was also on continuous offer at the Bond Street gallery itself But
his major goal was
the
offer by John Rothenstein
to
give him
a
retrospective
at the Tate Gallery, a recognition of the value of his
work to the image of his country. In the opinion of the Director of
the
Tate,
only
a
small
minority of painters were
not aware
that
anything unusual was being done for them. Bacon was one of these.
*Had he
never been
offered
a
retrospective he would
not have
noticed
the
omission; had
it been
cancelled he would
not have
demurred, yet no one could have responded to it more warmly.'
Whatever Bacon said to his drinking companions about his con-
tempt for being honoured, he co-operated
fully with Rothenstein
over the introduction
to the catalogue
for the
exhibition and the
show
itself. When he heard
that Rothenstein was
giving Lucian
Freud dinner at the Athenaeum to pump him for information. Bacon
invited himself to
supervise
the
interrogation.
Before he
arrived,
Freud said, 'Don't overlook the influence of Nietzsche on Francis',
and
as Rothenstein ushered
in
his two
guests, he was met with
the mild disapproval of the aged anarchist
critic Herbert Read
at
bringing two such bohemians
into
that august
place. When
the
introduction was finished, Rothenstein read
it to Bacon with some
trepidation. He knew of his subject's fickleness and whims of anger.
As
paragraph
after
paragraph
was
heard.
Bacon
said
nothing.
Rothenstein looked up to find him in tears, saying,
'I feel like the
painter you've described.
It's an experience
I've never had before,
partly,
I think, because you've treated my art in such a matter-of-
fact way.'
That previous night, Bacon had been up late, gambling at Charlie
Chester's Casino
in Soho, the usual unglamorous place where he
went to lose
his
shirt. During his absence, somebody had broken
into his studio through a skylight and had stolen two pictures - he
suspected that it was an acquaintance just out of prison.
It was to be
a prelude to his own future of choosing dangerous lovers. He and

164
Francis Bacon
Rothenstein talked of Lucian Freud, whom Francis thought one of
his more
intelligent and
entertaining
friends. He
even admired
Freud's life-style, which was as extreme as his own, but with girls -
*to bed, or rather
to
sleep,
at three, then up again
at seven, she
posing as his model'.
Bacon had
appreciated
Rothenstein's
introduction
to
the Tate
catalogue because
it had depicted his past life without frills and had
related his paintings to their mundane sources and to the everyday.
Two
paragraphs
particularly
struck home
and made him weep,
because
they appeared
to prove
that he had
achieved what he
wanted:
Bacon's contemporaries belong to generations that have seen the
destruction of cities by bomb, the flight of whole peoples under the
lash of fear, the concentration camps, the death camps and the
rest. His power of making human anguish dramatically significant
to our generation is due in part to the dignity and the sobriety of
his treatment of all his subjects, however horrible, and to the extent
to which he draws his imagery from the most characteristic and the
most widespread art-form prevalent today: the photograph repro-
duced
in
the newspaper and on
the
cinema
screen. However
extraordinary
the
imagery of Bacon,
it speaks
to
us
intimately
because
it speaks a language familiar to us
all; a language which,
more than any other factor, has formed our way of seeing
.
.
.
If artists
are once
again
to concern themselves with
external
reality - and surely man's interest in external reality and his urge
to communicate ideas are too deep-rooted to allow us to doubt that
eventually
they
will -
it
is
unlikely
to be by
returning
to
the
conventions of the past. By the arresting originality and dynamism
of his view of the external world, an originality which owes much
to his reliance on automatism and chance, to the audacity of his
forays across the borders of rationaUty, Bacon may well portend
the revival of an art that makes no claim to be self-sufficient but
seeks instead to communicate some truths believed to transcend
it.
Rothenstein also commented on Bacon's
originality and indepen-
dence as a man as well as a painter. He took Lucian Freud's advice
and wrote of Bacon having 'something of the dynamic amoralism
that Nietschze
justified; few people
live
lives more detached from

The Blood ofa British Man
1 65
organized society and none has less thought of making of his art a
vehicle of success, of acquiring either recognition or possessions; he
is
indifferent
to
both'.
This was
the
public
acclaim
that Bacon
sought, the statement that he did not want public acclaim. He would
smash
the
ladder
of success
rung
by
rung. And
yet
his
very
relationship with Rothenstein and his acceptance of a retrospective
exhibition at a state gallery proved that the accolade was not a foreign
gesture.
The Tate show of the works of Francis Bacon between 24 May
and
I July 1962
also proved
that Rothenstein was
right. He had
recorded the familiar past of his time, he had achieved what he had
told the Sunday Times before leaving to see Peter Lacey in Tangier,
^painting, in his own terms, "the history of the last thirty years".' To
examine the Tate catalogue
is to travel through time and view the
images that haunted each generation in each decade, an examination
of the waking dream and nightmare of those passing years. Starting
with his odd pock-marked portrait of 1930; ranging through his early
Christs on
the
Cross
in
their confined passion
to
his
definitive
'Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion' of 1944, the
howling Furies of the Second World War; viewing 'Figure
in
a
Landscape', all wound and meat by the hissing orifice of a machine-
gun; progressing past howling 'Magdalenes' under trilby hats and
umbrellas on
to
salivating heads and
screaming popes
within
a
vacuum and an empty cube; the animal and the bestial protruding
into power and executive privilege; the decomposition and melting
of the figure in agony and lechery; the serial and newsreel studies of
the congealing actions of mankind;
the sombre ghost of William
Blake and the
lurid 'phantom of the road' of Van Gogh and the
encapsulated howl of the nurse from The Battleship Potemkin;
the
contorted portraits that appeared to wring the real from the flesh as
if wax from
a
floor mop; the abandon and mutation of man and
woman in lure and motion.
These are the images that
I saw at the retrospective that summer
in London. And
I thought I had discerned the history of our time. If
I intrude into the text,
it is because
I have met and talked to Francis
Bacon
several
times, and he has always
treated me
as
the
social
historian
I am, and not the art critic
I am not. He has acknowledged

1 66
Francis Bacon
my trade and
its due
place
in
his work. Most of the
art
critics
appreciated the retrospective as well. As Director of the Tate, John
Rothenstein asserted that the exhibition was a resounding success,
attracting more praise than any exhibition by a British painter within
his memory. John Russell saw in the show a grand, ordered, coherent
look - 'a renewal of the European tradition, with very little about
it
that could be called bizarre or gratuitous'. Bacon was seen in his
rightful place.
Particularly praised was Bacon's new version of ^Three Studies
for a
Crucifixion'.
It reeked of blood and wet paint,
for he had
executed
it rapidly for the show, mainly inebriated because he knew
Peter Lacey was
seriously
ill
in Tangier. To begin with, he had
worked on the three canvases of the triptych separately, *but later, as
he brought them near completion, he worked on the three together.
It is a picture that he painted in about a fortnight, when he was in a
bad mood of drinking, and he did it under tremendous hangover and
drink; he sometimes hardly knew what he was doing. "It's one of the
only pictures that I've ever been able to do under drink.
I believe
that the drink helped me to be a bit freer."' To Lawrence Gowing,
this triptych was 'the masterly evocation of bodily fate that explored
unshrinkingly' the latent themes in Bacon's earlier works. The four
figures in the three canvases were joined in the theme of the violence
that men did to one another by the power of sex or hatred. The body
on the right, lying head down, suggested an inverted crucifixion by
Cimabue, which Bacon thought was like
'a worm crawling
.
.
. just
moving, undulating down the cross'.
The sudden death of Peter Lacey in Tangier was announced to
Francis Bacon after the opening of his exhibition
at the Tate. He
had even spoken amiably
to
the
press
critics
in
the morning
to
Rothenstein's surprise - 'the kind of occasion he usually avoids as
though plague-infested'. At the evening party after the private view,
a very formal occasion -
He appeared
in clothes he had worn
since morning: black and
white check shirt and blue jeans, but instead of wearing his black
leather coat he swung
it about as a toreador his cloak. At a few
paces distant he was followed by a few youths similarly dressed.

The Blood ofa British Man
1 67
He was very drunk, but his condition did not in the least diminish
his dignity or the charm he so powerfully exerts. When he left he
again thanked me for my part in the exhibition, embraced me, and
kissed me on both cheeks, making me
feel
like a French officer
receiving a decoration.'
A telegram reached Bacon at Reece Mews on his return from the
party at the Tate. Peter Lacey was dead.
It confirmed what he had
been painting and telling John Rothenstein for the catalogue of his
retrospective. He thought of death every day; he believed that there
was no life after death; but he did beheve in Hell - 'Hell is here and
now.' Death had come for his lover, not for him. Yet it did not mean
changing his existentialist routine. He went to the Colony Room the
following night, seeking solace at a wake being held for his friend.
Daniel Farson returned from Paris to find Bedlam in the Soho Club.
He presumed
all the members were celebrating the success of the
Tate exhibition, and when Rodrigo Moynihan's wife asked him
if
he had heard the news, he replied that he had. 'Francis must be
overjoyed.' She slapped his face. Bacon heard the sound. With his
usual delicacy and courtesy, he steered Farson to the lavatory and
told him that Lacey was gone.
This tragedy changed Bacon's subject matter in the 'sixties. It had
more
to do with intimacy than history. WTien the suggestion was
made to him that he might allay his grief through his
art, he did a
'Study for Three Heads' with a portrait of Lacey on the
left and
right canvas and a self-portrait at the centre. There were to be more
portraits of Lacey from photographs and memory, and then a series
of studies
of his companions from
the Colony Room, who had
consoled him, particularly Henrietta Moraes, the wife of the poet
Dom, and Isabel Rawsthorne, now married to a second composer,
Alan, after the death of Constant Lambert. Bacon was also to paint
his
artist friends, particularly Lucian Freud, and
his next beloved
George Dyer, another burglar who may well have been the acquaint-
ance who stole the two paintings on the eve of his Tate exhibition.
After lunching with Dom Moraes, Stephen Spender had also gone
to the retrospective. He observed, rather censoriously, in his journal:

1 68
Francis Bacon
Saw Francis Bacon exhibition
at the Tate. The paintings make
horrifying statements with very great force. They are by an observer
so profoundly affected by the kind of Ufe he observes that, although
protesting, they seem corrupted by the corruption. After Bacon
most
other contemporary
painting seems
decoration,
doodling,
aestheticism or stupidity. His work extremely devoid of pleasure,
perhaps
this
is partly due to the Hfe of disillusionment he leads,
which he faces in
its impHcations; perhaps
it
is the old English
Puritanism and dislike of pleasure cropping up again.
Six days later at a dinner party, Spender met Bacon, who told him
of the death of Peter Lacey. He was offended that the
critics had
said his pictures were full of hatred and without love. He had loved
his dead friend. Spender said that
it struck him that Bacon did not
express that feeling in his
art. Bacon replied that he could not do
that at present, 'that certain friends were far too beautiful for him to
distort - and he had always distorted'. Another week
later, Bacon
had Spender
to
dinner and
continued
to
talk about
Lacey,
but
cheered up when the conversation shifted to Raphael and Michel-
angelo. He declared that his ambition was
'to do something really
beautiful and not ugly as all my paintings are, before
I die'.
In his loneliness, Francis Bacon spent much time with a circle of
old and new
friends, who grouped around Sonia Orwell
in her
Kensington home. They saw the intellectual side of him rather than
the hand on
the champagne
glass. He was
always
in
control of
his drinking: when he had a gall-bladder operation, he followed his
doctor's orders
for a year and foreswore
alcohol, only
to resume
his evening carouses when his liver could support the damage. With
Sonia Orwell, Bacon would meet Jeanetta Jackson, Shusha Guppy,
Patrick Kinross, Joan and Patrick Leigh-Fermor, and the French
cultural
attache, Jean-Marie Benoit. They ate chiefly in the upper
room of the Etoile: Bacon would entertain his boon companions at
Wheeler's. With his usual generosity. Bacon paid for everybody, and
he would support Sonia Orwell through her long illness and
final
weeks at Blake's Hotel. Few artists were ever more giving to those
friends who rescued them from the desperate isolation of the trade.
Bacon talked to literary figures in their terms, of hatred and love,
of beauty and ugliness. He did not talk to his friends in the Colony

The Blood ofa British Man
1 69
Room like that. The language there was honest and practical, jokey
and
unpretentious.
It was
hardly
a question of the newspeak of
George
Orwell
or
the
double
logic
of the
Jesuits,
but
of
the
inteUigence and taste of the
artist, who could suit his sentences to
the company he kept. A week before his Tate retrospective, Roth-
enstein had introduced him to Lord Cottesloe, who was the Chair-
man
of the
Arts
Council. Bacon was,
as
always,
determined
to
encounter the Establishment on his own terms. His first words were,
Tve such a hangover that
I can hardly stand up', but after making
his point, *he carried on the conversation with the utmost suavity'.
Bacon ever managed
to be himself, yet
all things
to
all men. He
maintained
the
delicate
balance
of the
tightrope walker swaying
above the abysses of London society without a safety net. He would
listen to anyone with courteous attention, then answer in his lilting
and patrician cockney, wisely or waspishly, but always well.
The question was, whether any writer could describe him or his
paintings. Patrick White came to London the year after the retro-
spective at the Tate and saw Bacon's exhibition at Marlborough Fine
Art. He was celebrating with his British publishers the success of his
novel
Voss and
also
revisiting
his
old
lover and mentor, Roy de
Maistre, who was losing his sight and his health and trying to conceal
the ravages of age with ochre pancake make-up, which stopped at
his ears, leaving a pale white ring round his neck. De Maistre offered
to
leave
to White
in
his
will
his
studio with
its screen and
sofa
designed by Bacon, but the novelist refused. He had in his mind to
write about an obsessive artist, not to inherit the early and discarded
works of one. The setting would be Sydney in AustraUa, not London.
For one of White's
frustrations was
that he was destined not
to
become a painter himself. As he admitted:
'I had imagined that if I
could acquire the technique
I might give visual expression to what
I
have inside me, and that the physical act of painting would exhilarate
me far more than grinding away at grey, bronchial prose. This could
be the delusion of a writer who has always resented having to write.'
Instead, White set down in words The
Vivisector.
It was to be the
most illuminating novel on the visions of a modern painter since
Joyce Cary's The Horse's Mouth, which had been written during the
Second World War. Yet White's protagonist. Hurtle Duffield, had a

1 70
Francis Bacon
different mind and eye to Gary's GuUey Jimson. In his search for the
truth in Sydney and the outback, Hurtle eviscerated his subjects as
Bacon
did,
as a child drawing a tutor with a bestial and diseased
appearance, and representing, when a man, an adopted and beloved
hunchback sister as an octopus beside a bidet with a sponge on one
sucker. In Chelsea in London, however, Gulley had been modelled
on Augustus John and Matthew Smith, and his perception was filled
with
lush nudes and
the
divine
glory of the
light on
the
River
Thames. But to Hurtie, creation was cruel. The motto he scrawled
on the wall was:
GOD THE VIVISECTOR
GOD THE ARTIST
GOD
When White was writing his novel in Sydney, Bacon was already so
influential that a school of young Australian
artists was
trying
to
imitate his inimitable style. Many of Hurtle Duffield's characteristics
were
those
of the young London
artist, whom White
had
first
encountered with Roy de Maistre in the 'thirties ~ his love of paint,
his urge
to destroy
his
canvases, and
his
delight
in the 'random
arabesques' to be found on boards and walls. Like Bacon, Hurtle
Duffield had an aristocratic descent and no early education except
from one rector's wife. Adopted by a wealthy couple. Hurtle was
reared in a big house like Straffan Lodge or Jesmond Towers, where
he
first saw some Victorian paintings of naked ladies and thought
that they looked like *old cold pudding'. Even writing of himself at
the age of six. Hurtle declared he felt older than that.
'I don't think
age has always
to do with what you
feel because my
father and
mother who are old never have the same feelings or thoughts as me.
They do not understand what I tell them so
I have just about had to
give up telling.' The incomprehension that Hurtle suffered from his
parents was also the early fate of Francis Bacon.
In one telling episode. Hurtle's adopted mother pushed the child's
head among her dresses hanging in a wardrobe. 'The sensation was at
first one of blinding, then of a delicious suffocation as his face was
swallowed by the scented silky darkness.' Loving ladies' clothes as his

The Blood ofa British Man
171
prototype did, Hurtle also ran away from his grand house at the age of
sixteen, but to enlist in the Australian Army during the First World
War. He never returned home again, existing in Paris for a while as a
dishwasher like George Orwell rather than as a boyfriend like Francis
Bacon. Hurtle was heterosexual, although odd in his view of the act of
intercourse, comparing his adopted mother and father making love to
two plucked chickens. His first passion was for a blowsy Sydney tart
called Nance Lightfoot - curiously enough, the surname taken as an
alias by Bacon when a manservant in the 'thirties. Hurtle wondered
how far art was dependent on sexuality, had a vision of his beloved as
Goya's Saturn, and saw her as 'Nance Spreadeagle', just as Bacon
depicted Henrietta Moraes for his Marlborough show.
Monomaniac
and
driven.
Hurtle
allowed Nance
to
prostitute
herself to pay for his art, and also took cheques from his homosexual
gallery dealer, who was consumed by an unanswered love for him.
'He guessed each was perverse enough to enjoy the voluptuousness
of any suffering involved. Whatever the moral climate, the painter
continued perving on and painting
.
.
.' Nance herself accused Hurde
of being a secret homosexual, because
all men were
in love with
themselves. Only when a man
felt good about himself, he had to
have a woman and call
it love. 'At least the poofs are honest. They
look around for another poof. To be on the right track, you oughter
be,
all of you, one big set of poofs!' Later, when Nance had fallen
to her death down
a
ravine,
leaving Hurde
to
feel
guilty about
murdering her, he almost agreed with her remarks, while talking to
a gay grocer on
a park bench
in The Gash
in Sydney. 'Human
beings aren't allowed to choose what they shall love: woman, man,
cat- or God.'
Bacon was also destined to what he loved and to the loss of it, for
Peter Lacey was now dead. Hurde accepted that even the suicide of
a loved one was a form of murder. Who knew what drove the self-
destroyer to the
act.'* His next passion, a Greek woman named Hero,
specifically identified his art with that of Bacon, saying, 'The painter
is cruel. Why do painters have to deform everything they see.^' Later,
she loathed his series of paintings of kittens being taken away by her
husband to be drowned. Man was cruel, God was cruel. 'We are his
bagful of cats, aren't we.^' This was why Hurde Duffield was a sort

172
Francis Bacon
of Francis Bacon, to envision God as a Vivisector, and to see the
pursuit of the image of truth to be the insertion of the flaying-knife
beneath
the
appearance
into
the
essence
of things. As
Hurtle's
adopted sister told him, she might always be vivisected afresh, *in the
name of truth - or art'.
At the end of the novel, Patrick White invented a last love affair
between the elderly Hurtle and an adolescent painter, Kathy Volkov.
He was writing of his own introduction to the truth of being an artist,
which was given to him by the older Roy de Maistre. At first Kathy
would not
let Hurtle paint her, because her mother said that she
would be
at the mercy of the painter, worse than the mercy of a
husband. *A husband goes away. But the painter has painted the
painting.' Later she and Hurtle made
love, and he did paint her.
Although she ran off and became as egoistic a concert pianist as he
was a painter, she did acknowledge in the end that he had shown her
how to be an artist, as Roy de Maistre had shown the young Patrick
White, too, in Eccleston Street and the young Francis Bacon before
him. As she said to Hurtle:
*If I've learnt anything of importance,
it was you who taught me,
and
I thank you for it ...
It was you who taught me how to see, to
be,
to know
instinctively. When
I used
to come
to your house
in
Flint
Street,
melting with excitement and
terror, wondering
whether I would dare go through with it again, or whether
I would
turn to wood, or dough, or say something so stupid and tacdess
you would chuck me out into the street, it wasn't simply thought of
the delicious kisses and
all the other lovely play which forced the
courage into me.
It was the paintings
I used to look at sideways
whenever
I got a chance.
I wouldn't have
let on, because
I was
afraid you might have been amused, and made me talk about them,
and been even more amused when
I couldn't discuss them at your
level. But I was drinking them in through the pores of my skin
.
.
.
'I can't call you "lover", although
I suppose that, technically,
is
what you have been - or "dirty seducer"! if I hadn't wanted, had to
be seduced -
still
I prefer to think of you as the father of anything
praiseworthy that will ever come out of me.
Hurde Duffield also started to speak of the reason why Bacon chose
to be a vivisector in his pictures. His adopted sister said that from

The Blood ofa British Man
173
his
last
exhibitions,
she was now beginning
to understand. 'The
horrors are less horrible
if youVe created them yourself. Is that
it.^'
He replied, 'No, Fm still trying to arrive at the truth.' She said that
perhaps she did not understand, the truth could look so dishonest.
But it was not. Hurtle insisted. 'If it were only a question of paint -
but
is
it dishonest to pour out one's
life-blood.^' Although Bacon
stressed that his pictures were only a question of paint, he was never
dishonest and poured out his life-blood, too. And he was to refuse a
knighthood as Duffield did, and he had been given a retrospective at
the Tate Gallery just as Hurtie was
in his State
Gallery, only to
comment that
it was
'a bit of a give-away, though ... To see your
life hung out - your whole life of dirty washing.'
The Vivisector was dedicated by the author to his friends, Cynthia
and Sidney Nolan, the best Australian painter of his time. Nolan
also had a retrospective exhibition at the Art Gallery of New South
Wales in 1967 in honour of his fiftieth birthday and came to believe
that
he
was
the
only model
for
Hurtle
Duffield,
although
his
background and domestic life could not have been more dissimilar.
White told him that he was not in the least the inspiration for the
book, but Nolan preferred to think that he was and basked in White's
praise of his retrospective show, that
'it was staggering to see all the
imaginative and painting genius that has poured out of one man'.
It
was to end badly between the two Australians, with White accusing
Nolan of marrying again too soon after the suicide of his first wife,
'throwing himself on another woman's breast before the ashes were
barely cold'. Nolan retaliated by painting caricatures of White in his
pictures and by saying of him on television, 'I'm
fit, heterosexual,
I
produce the goods and he couldn't.'
The minor prototype of the aged Hurtle Duffield, the lover and
teacher of both White and Bacon, was dying as Hurtle did at the end
of The Vivisector. Roy de Maistre had been the only man, other than
John
Rothenstein, who
had been
allowed
to
view and
criticise
Bacon's works in progress in his studio before his Tate exhibition.
Hearing how
ill his old tutor in
life and art had come to be, Bacon
offered
with
his
habitual
generosity
to send him and
his young
companion to convalesce in a Mediterranean resort; but the declining
artist had a stroke and never recovered from the ensuing coma. 'He

174
Francis Bacon
was
a master of lucid,
expressive composition/ John Rothenstein
wrote of his valued
friend,
'but
also of colour achieved through
scientific knowledge
as well
as
sensibility. The
brilliant
light of a
summer afternoon and winter twilight revealed different but equally
moving ranges of his colour harmonies.' As he was associated with
no fashionable tendency and had no dealers, he was neglected by
private and public collectors. His art was in the teaching of it to the
young artist.
Perhaps no painter may ever wholly be described by any writer,
even those of genius such as Joyce Gary and Patrick White. The
word can never be what the picture
is. In this surly and egocentric
age of deconstruction, each viewer is king and queen and judge. The
art critic
is said to be abolished. Yet the biographer and the social
historian are not. Their job is to explain the interaction between the
individual and
his
times, and whether
as an
artist, he expressed
what he intended to those times. Talking to Bacon's friend, David
Sylvester,
J.
R. Ackerley demanded
to know how Bacon
actually
painted. When he was
told,
he
found
it
analogous
to
his own
methods and feelings at work. 'I think writers (and it certainly applies
to me) live often in a state of emotional overflow as they work, tears
(perhaps maudlin),
self-hugs of delight,
grins of satisfied
hatred:
these pleasures are partiy psychological, partly artistic - the extant
phrase or word, the inalterably perfect passage -
' He might have
been describing Bacon's pleasure when he achieved the inalterably
perfect brush-stroke by chance and design.
The
paintings
of Bacon,
however,
could
deeply
offend
those
qualified critics of art, who also had a moral point of view as major
novelists.
Anita Brookner was
one.
Originally,
she welcomed
his
exhibition at the Tate Gallery because
it contained a human drama
which involved the spectator as much as
it did the
artist.
'It
is like
the last communication of a man forgotten at the bottom of a light
shaft,
and
slowly
degenerating
from
fear,
hunger,
and
inertia.'
Whereas
artists had
painted
flowers and
landscapes.
Bacon
did
something only possible after the first generation of Freudians - he
painted traumas. 'His slimly, slithering, purblind images' had been
linked
with
Hiroshima
and
Eichmann;
but
these
were
modish
reasons
for
that
despair. The impact of a Bacon portrait was
to

The Blood ofa British Man

induce sheer panic
as
in anyone Vho has
fled
in
terror from
a
sickroom or experienced the motionless turmoil of Sunday solitude.
Such painful weaknesses, breeding greater disgust on each recollec-
tion, are here captured in visual rather than literary form.
I do not
think that this has been done before. On purely quantitative grounds,
therefore, Francis Bacon is a unique artist.'
Brookner agreed that Bacon was untaught and uncorrupted by art
school training. Yet she considered that, whether he liked
it or not,
he was the legatee of the nineteenth-century Expressionists
-- Van
Gogh, Munch, Ensor, Soutine and Kokoschka - as well as of his
obvious references
to Velazquez and Rembrandt, Muybridge and
Eisenstein. She ended by admitting against her better judgement:
Of Bacon's importance there can surely be
little doubt, although
cautious voices have been heard to dismiss him as ^fashionable'.
(He
is
fashionable
only
in
the sense
that
in
certain moods we
shall find his pictures irrelevant and repulsive.) Here
at last
is a
contemporary painter of true stature, whose endless communion
with the realm beyond our understanding marks a definite breach
in the polite tyranny of formal conventions. Bacon
is committed
to his nervous system just as Van Gogh was once committed to
his
desire
to love
all men. The emotional rage has shrunk:
the
relevance for the rest of us is the same. We are not called upon to
admire or applaud these works, and we are certainly not meant to
enjoy them. But if we can acknowledge the fact that painting can
still be a mirror to certain states of being, we may find that the
standards we apply to the greater part of contemporary art have
undergone a radical shift.
Fellow artists were his chosen company rather than the writers who
saw him through the lenses of the sentences they heaped upon him.
He painted Lucian Freud many times, finding in him another free
spirit, who owned nothing and lived anywhere. He was as tough as
Bacon with a constitution of titanium that hardly showed in his slight
body and pale
features. He shared Bacon's hatred of the law and
made
his own
rules each
day,
reacting
to
every circumstance
as
Bacon always did. With no code or clock, he lived by steel whim at
any hour of the day and night, and rejoiced at meeting his friends.

176
Francis Bacon
Frank Auerbach was
another
painter of extraordinary
talent and
acute
mind,
who
had
been
inspired
by
Bacon's
example
and
technique, saying his best portraits seemed
*like risen
spirits'. He
had been born in Berlin in 1931, and sometimes spoke of his art as
if he were Bacon himself, saying, 'The paint itself seems to breed
images.
I try to take the picture to the point where
it seems to make
itself.' He also said that great paintings were done 'by people who
were prepared to take a risk - when they've got something that
is
almost a success, they are prepared to destroy it, or chuck it away for
something grander'. But Bacon found that Auerbach always contra-
dicted him and said what he called accident was not at all accidental.
Anyway, Bacon painted him along with Lucian Freud
in a double
portrait in 1964, each artist sprawling on a red divan, wearing white
singlets and nothing else, their calves and thighs pink and voluptu-
ous, their quick intelligences contorting their faces into the mobile
essence of being that Bacon sought to show in those he knew. He
insisted that he did not wish to make freaks out of them, he would
like them to look as attractive as they really were. He was describing
their behaviour by the methods of his
art. He could not do
it
in
conversation.
As a painter, though. Bacon's
style had nothing to do with
his
artist
friends,
particularly
not
with
a
third
companion,
Richard
Hamilton, said to be the founder of Pop Art. While Freud built up
his studies of the human body by meticulous detail and hair by exact
hair. Bacon charged at his subject in a whirl of brushes. Auerbach
also was far more deliberate, and if there were traces of Bacon to be
discerned in his early works, they found less and less in common
outside the pleasure of their mutual company and the testing of their
differences at Wheeler's over the Chablis and the sole. Bacon even
owned a painting by Auerbach at one time, but he gave
it away to a
friend 'who just got drunk on
it and that was that.'
With Richard Hamilton, however, the contrasts were fundamental
and marked
the
times. Pop Art became more
fashionable
in
the
'sixties
than even Bacon was, and
they both used
contemporary-
magazine pictures. But while Bacon looked to the newsreel image,
history in the making as in the shot of the crowd running in panic
through the square in St. Petersburg, Hamilton chose the advertising

The Blood ofa British Man
1 77
image, the commercial aspect of reality. While Bacon searched for
the moment of crisis
in human
action, Hamilton caricatured the
motive and the cash of human acquisition. In his notorious definition
of Pop Art of 1957, Hamilton set down every single thing that Bacon
avoided like the plague in his art:
Popular (designed for a mass audience)
Transient (short-term solution)
Expendable (easily forgotten)
Low cost
Mass-produced
Young (aimed at youth)
Witty
Sexy
Gimmicky
Glamorous
Big business
While Bacon was looking for a visceral Truth Art, Hamilton was
defining Pop Art in gross and commercial terms, as if the condition
of the people could be defined less by their pain than by their greed.
Human desire was translated by Bacon into sexual terms. His sofas
and beds were the battlegrounds of his tortured lovers and friends,
Lacey and
Freud. They were
not
the
derisive
objects of man's
cupidity and comfort, bought from a furniture store. Actually, Bacon
did trawl the Tottenham Court Road above Soho and stare balefully
at the settees and three-piece suites and lurid carpets in the shop
windows. He had crafted better objects in his youth. And he liked
seeing himself reflected in the plate glass of Heal's as his viewers
were
in the picture
glass
that covered
his own paintings. But he
never guyed the bad taste of his time as Hamilton did. He wanted its
guts, pure and simple. He was a surgeon, not a sceptic. At a high
level, he went for the offal, while Hamilton was cerebral. At a lower
one, he had
the
vision of a butcher, when Hamilton considered
the eye of the consumer. Their messages were markets and cash
registers apart. For at the end, Hamilton used the images of mass
appeal not only to mock them, but to say, 'Buy my pictures, too.' As
Michael Wishart said to Bacon, Top is to painting as chewing-gum

178
Francis Bacon
is to gastronomy.
I prefer nourishment.' Bacon liked that.
If he did
admire Hamilton's technique, he could not digest its content.
David
Hockney
was
another
young
artist, who
escaped
the
influence of Bacon to become
as financially successful, but
at the
price of transmuting the images of consumerism
to appeal
to
his
audience. He even used a series of colour Polaroid shots to make an
expensive
collage of a sunny swimming-pool
in
California, which
cocked a commercial snook at Bacon's use of photographs merely
as
scalpels
to
penetrate
the byways
of behaviour.
Hockney was
impressed when he saw the Bacon exhibition of 1 960 at Marlborough
Fine Art, particularly by the male nudes. 'One of the things
I liked
about them', he said, 'was that you could smell the balls'. He thought
that Bacon had resuscitated the importance of the human figure in
modern art, and he liked the rough canvas - he was then painting on
hessian. He also appreciated Bacon's use of magazine illustrations as
sources for his work, because of their flatness.
Still confined by the
drawing methods learned
at
art school, Hockney further admired
Bacon's technique of painting without sketching. These images had
*a crudity and vigour which help the impact of the pictures'.
Hockney himself was to follow Bacon's pioneering depictions of
homosexuality and came out in 1963 with a painting. Two Men in a
Shower.
In
a
subsequent
series
also
featuring
curtains,
he
used
Muybridge explicidy in his painting of two naked women, entided as
the Victorian photograph was, 'Seated Woman Drinking Tea, Being
Served by Standing Companion', although
it also had undertones of
lesbianism
as had
Courbet's
'Le Sommeil' -
a
picture
that had
always influenced Bacon when he was showing two men entwined
on twisted bedclothes. Overt homosexual art was becoming accept-
able
in
the
period
before
the
repeal
of the
laws
against
sexual
intercourse between men.
It was
a banner, faindy waving,
for the
advance guard of the long gay crusade to come.
A particular catalyst of the male artistic scene was Alfred Hecht,
the picture framer in the King's Road in Chelsea. He was used by
Francis Bacon
to frame
all
his
paintings, and
his
shop,
as John
Rothenstein averred, had become
'a
sort of club which had many
influential "members"
and where
issues
for
the
art world were
discussed and
even
resolved'. Bacon
insisted
that Hecht
set
his

The Blood ofa British Man
179
paintings in heavy gold frames under thick glass. This was not only
to protect them, but to set them apart from their environment, also
to contrast the elegant gilt surround w^ith the human rage and passion
contained within
the
picture. An amateur of chance. Bacon
also
appreciated the play of light on the glass in the form of reflections.
His paintings could include the viewer and the background, a total
immersion. Of his dark blue series. Bacon said that he wanted the
spectator to see himself in the glass and join in the proceedings.
Hecht moved in the grandest of circles, knowing members of the
Royal Family, as well as in the artistic milieu that was his livelihood.
In putting together artists with rich patrons, he excelled even Roy de
Maistre and most gallery owners outside Marlborough Fine Art. He
collected
paintings himself and
gave
the most
interesting dinner
parties
in
all
Chelsea,
mixing
actors and
artists,
aristocrats
and
politicians, particularly with his good friends Aneurin Bevan and his
wife Jennie
Lee,
and
Arnold Goodman,
the
lawyer who would
become Chairman of the Arts Council. He had great charm and wit,
but a streak of melancholy, often complaining about having to hide
his past and his preferences in public, as popular prejudice and the
law were what they were. 'How can
I say
I am a German-Jewish
homosexual.^' he would moan, only to hear the reply from friends
such as the interior dectorator, Kenneth Partridge, 'As
if everyone
didn't know, dear.'
With his political connections, Hecht was enough of a crusader to
start
a homosexual
film
society, run from
offices
in
Shaftesbury
Avenue. He
also campaigned
for
the
repeal of the
laws
against
homosexuality, cadging pictures from sympathetic artists which were
sold at Sotheby's through the benevolence of its head, Peter Wilson.
Bacon himself would never give any of his paintings to any cause,
and certainly not to political reform. Yet he pressed his art on those
he
loved:
they were,
after
all,
often
the
subject of his
pictures.
'He gave money'.
Partridge
said, 'where he
felt
it was personally
deserved'. And he contributed anonymously to the acquisition by the
nation of the masters whom he admired. 'You'll never get any money
out of homosexuals,' Hecht would complain
to Jennie Lee, 'even
though it's for their cause'.
Because of his
sexual preferences Bacon had been obHged
to

1 80
Francis Bacon
break the law for forty years since the 'twenties. Although he could
not profess his inclinations in public any more than Hecht
felt that
he could, he was well-known for them and had declared his passions
in
his
paintings.
Speaking
to
the
liberal Sunday newspaper,
the
Observer, shortly before his retrospective at the Tate, he did say that
he found the world of criminals more interesting than the world of
normal people. He did not say that he was drawn
to consort with
criminals because of his homosexuality. He was outside the law , as
they were. He was merely not driven to militance or to public protest,
as some of his persuasion were.
It
is easy to forget how threatened
homosexuals
felt at the time. 'Jews, Quakers, Jehovah's Witnesses,
homosexuals, and many others went to Dachau and other camps,
and
there they
died,' Douglas Plummer wrote
in Queer People
in
1963. 'There are no concentration camps in Britain, but there are
jails for homosexuals.' Although Bacon never fell foul of the statute
book and would have rather gone to gaol than pay blackmail, he did
what he wanted and avoided the law.
The profile of Bacon in the Observer stressed that if he did not
fit
into ordinary society, he was by no means a rebel or an activist. 'On
his
best
behaviour,
he would
give no
hostess
anxiety
about
his
performance at her dinner table. His manner is unformidable, gentle
and
unaffected. He
is
a good
talker,
bubbling,
funny,
friendly,
gesticulating
elegantly with
strong, plump
forearms.' He was
an
articulate, sophisticated character, who did not think there was much
point
in
talking about
his work, on
the
principle
enunciated
by
Pavlova that 'if I knew why
I danced
I wouldn't dance'. He did say,
however, that his starting point was always his own nervous system:
'I always want to record a face or body, and
I want to do
it as near my
own feelings as possible.
It's the exact opposite of abstract painting.'
The recording of faces and bodies chiefly in the portraits of his
friends would be Bacon's war of nerves on the 'sixties. He had given
up painting the sensational and the shocking. 'When
I was younger,
I needed extreme
subject
matter,' he
told John
Russell. 'Now
I
don't.' He wanted to paint the behaviour of those he knew intimately.
Yet it was a business at risk, in a way more of a hazard than gambling
at roulette
at Charlie Chester's casino. 'To be and not
to
be,' he
declared the problem of the portrait painter; what to put in of the

The Blood ofa British Man
1 8

known and the unknown, in order to reinforce each other. The task
was not made easier by portraiture having a bad name at that time:
either the painter was thought to be too servile to the vanity of the
sitter or too merciless, as when the portrait of Winston Churchill by
Graham Sutherland was destroyed by his family rather than shown
for the nation.
The moving picture as the still work of art, the apergu of unguarded
action,
these were
to be
Bacon's
contribution
to
the
art of the
portrait. The desperate and despairing look of the faces caught in
flinching and avoiding some unseen blow were explained by Bacon
as nothing to do with the human condition.
It was a question of his
quick method of brushing paint directly onto rough canvas.
If his
people looked as
if they were in a dreadful
fix, he said that
it was
because he could not get them out of the technical dilemma. 'As
I
see
it, there's nothing, today, between a documentary painting and a
very great work in which the documentary element is transcended.'
To him, the production of that very great work depended on the
chance of the paint. He continued to destroy more than he kept. He
took to smaller spaces for his heads and serial images, the two sides
of a
triptych looking
in
at the
staring centrepiece.
In the 'Three
Studies for a Portrait of Henrietta Moraes' of 1963, the edge of the
frame slices off the body as figures are cut by the edges ofJapanese
porcelain saucers or as dominant profiles are inset against a back-
ground in Flemish or Italian Renaissance small heads. Yet Bacon's
subjects seem
to writhe within the
oils. The three mouths of the
loose-lipped Moraes pout and sulk and stammer, while her sets of
eyes wink and hold and glance. To look at the triptych from left to
right
is
to watch mobile
features making a comment that says
in
silence: 'See -
I - Live.'
Although the faces in the portraits were inevitably contorted, they
appeared as the blur of a movement, an action caught in a glimpse
from the corner of the eye. He did put in ears and eyes on faces, but
he liked to put them in as irrationally as possible. He always changed
a resemblance. 'One thing
I'd
like
to
have', he once
said,
'is an
enormous room lined with distorting mirrors from floor to ceiling.'
He had a cracked and webbed mirror covering his bedroom wall in
Reece Mews, but it shivered the reflections of bodies into fragments

1 82
Francis Bacon
rather than making them bulge. 'Every so often', he went on, *there'd
be a normal mirror inset among the distorting ones.' He had mixed
mirror glass with opaque and clear glass in his oval table-tops of the
'thirties, the angled reflection with the obscure and the transparent.
'People would look so beautiful', he ended, 'when they passed
in
front of the normal
mirror.' As
Russell pointed
out,
in
Bacon's
portraits of the
'sixties
the normal image was
laid on top of the
distorted one. They were both simultaneously present in an arrested
motion, the superimposition and the dissolve of the cinema.
As he had once studied in Paris an illustrated text on diseases of
the mouth, now Bacon was reading
a book
called
Positioning
in
Radiography. He was fascinated not only by the X-ray photographs of
the bones and sinews and nerves beneath the skin, but also by the
angles used by the medical photographer to view the body to the best
effect. The
vivisector had
to approach
his victim from
the
right
stance. He had to penetrate to the recesses of human behaviour, the
very motives of the instinct for violence. As John Russell perceived
as deeply as Bacon, the portraits of the period progressed:
To
the
point,
in
fact,
at which
the
face
as we know
it would
disappear
altogether
in
the
jewelled
slime of the
paint,
leaving
behind
it an
eye-socket,
or
the deep
cave
of a
nostril,
or an
irreducible patch of hair,
as tokens
that somewhere among the
strong-willed chromatic smearing
a named individual was com-
memorated. No question, here, of setting the scene: we are at a
dentist's distance from eyes, nose, mouth and teeth, and the rest
of the world is blocked out.
Bacon used to patronise a medical bookshop in Gower Street to pick
up textbooks, suc);i 2isA Colour Atlas ofNursing Procedures in Accidents
and Emergencies. He was fascinated by the illustrations of syphilitic
sores and other wounds and tumours, which he used in his paintings.
He did not shudder
at them, but thought himself fortunate. 'My
God,' he would say, 'I'm lucky
I don't have that.'
After meeting Bacon
in the
street
in the summer of 1962 and
hearing him say uncharacteristically that sometimes
it was good to
take
a very
long
time
over
things,
Stephen Spender
visited
the
painter in Reece Mews and wrote down what he said about his
art.

The Blood ofa British Man
1 83
It should not be a record, but an exploration of reality which gave
it
a new twist. What he was thinking all the time was how in painting
he could slightly complicate the game.
'I can do very little but I think
when
I am optimistic that
I might
still live to make the game a bit
more complicated.'
By the new twist, Bacon meant some
little thing, which gave the
image added depth and poignancy. Spender said that with the whole
weight of past painting behind him, even that Httle thing might be
too much. Bacon considered that the current New York school was
wrong, because
it simply ignored the past. If painting was treated as
though
it had never happened
before,
the
result would be mere
decoration.
Ticasso,
he
thought,
often went
too
far and
simply
produced decoration.'
So had the models and giants of his youth been overtaken by his
solitary pursuit of his own genius. In a way, he personified the creed
of the young artists of his time, who had rediscovered Nietzsche's
philosophy and called it self- fulfilment. The artist was the expression
of his own ego. His message was only himself. He was an outlaw,
and society, if anything, owed him a living. The artist was, above all,
self-declared.
'I am an artist because
I say
I am,' was the statement.
There were two fundamental differences, however, between Bacon
and the young painters of the
'sixties. Although self-taught, he had
trained and worked at his trade with dedication for forty years, while
they put protest above their short practice. And he had genius, while
the less their talent, the louder they howled. In a decade when there
were hundreds of thousands of young
artists who achieved
their
position by stating they were what they said they were, there was
only one Francis Bacon, unparalleled, unmatched and unrepentant.
His
fame
grew
without
his
help. A
modified
version
of
his
retrospective at the Tate Gallery, which included nearly half of his
surviving
pictures,
travelled
across
Europe,
to
the
Kunsthalle
in
Mannheim, to the Galleria Civica d'Arte Moderne in Turin, to the
Kunsthaus in Zurich, and to the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam.
In
Switzerland,
one
of America's
greater
poets, John
Ashbery,
reviewed the show, acting as the art critic of the international edition
of the New
York Herald
Tribune.
Although
he knew
of Bacon's
loathing of American
abstract
art, Ashbery thought
that Bacon's

184
Francis Bacon
statement on painting published in the catalogue was reminiscent of
Jackson Pollock, De Kooning or Kline:
Real painting is a mysterious and continuous struggle with chance
- mysterious because the very substance of the paint, when used in
this way, can make such a direct assault on the nervous system:
continuous because the medium
is so fluid and subde that every
change
that
is made loses what
is already there
in the hope of
making a fresh gain.
I think that paindng today
is pure intuidon
and luck and taking advantage of what happens when you splash
the bits down.
Ashbery
also saw
in
the Zurich Museum
the
large
collection of
Romantic and Gothic paintings by the Swiss-born Fuseli, the friend
of Byron and
Shelley. He commented
that
nothing made him
uneasier
than
FuseH's
scenes
from
Shakespeare,
unless
it were
Bacon's portraits of Van Gogh. The work of both painters suggests
high-speed snapshots of a nightmare. Out of vague and terrifying
spaces, figures suddenly congeal with the incontrovertible reality of
characters
in a dream.' The
essential difference was the concen-
tration of Bacon:
His subject matter is still man in the horror of his isolation - naked
and
obscene
on
a
studio
couch,
or
grinning baboonlike
from
behind
a
desk.
Yet,
strangely enough.
Bacon's work
is
neither
horrible nor depressing. His tremendous gifts crowd out all feelings
but admiration, and after the initial shock one begins to feel almost
on friendly terms with the creatures in his zoo.
It may be an ugly,
obscene and terrifying world, but it is also a deeply human one.
The following year in the October of 1963, another retrospective of
Bacon was mounted in the Guggenheim Museum designed by Frank
Lloyd Wright in New York. Even the startiing and gutting images of
his aggressive century seemed as postage stamps or slogans of hate
floating like graffiti within the curving spaces of that immense spiral
of concrete. What were his howls and vacua and black cages to this
luminous and
grandiose
conch-shell.^ For
once.
Bacon's
art was
overwhelmed by the architecture, which reduced
its force. To view

The Blood ofa British Man
185
it was to spy on anguish through peepholes. And no silent scream
from an imprisoned pope could release the painter's genius from
this vast, bright snare.
It is hard to know whether a great painter reflects the image of his
age
or
creates
a
recognisable
one. Both
are probably
true,
in
a
process
of unconscious
interaction.
Yet by painting
his personal
obsessions. Bacon appeared
to represent dominant visions of the
'sixties. ^Violence is the natural artistic language of the times,' Peter
Brook declared
'.
.
.
it's our reality, there's no way round
it.' He was
currently directing in London a play of outrage, Peter Weiss's The
Persecution andAssassination ofMarat as Performed by the Inmates ofthe
Asylum ofCharenton under the direction of the Marquis de Sade. Asked
to comment on Brook's assertion, David Hockney supposed that the
theatre
director was thinking of Francis Bacon when considering
violence in art. 'But a painter using violence as an activity, as Bacon
does,
is rare.' The theatre dealt constantly with human activity, but
the range was wider in painting. Although many reUgious pictures
had violent themes - and the Crucifixion was an act of supreme
violence -
a
successful painting of violence had
to have human
connotations.
Violent action alone becomes placid in time. Destructive painters,
creating pieces of plastic
to be destroyed by
acid,
or sculpture
which blows
itself up,
are
not violent
in
the way
that Bacon's
screaming Pope
is. A picture painted in a violent way, an action
painting where the
artist slashes away, throwing paint about, has
nothing directly violent about
it.
It can never leave you with the
taste of violence in your mouth as Bacon can, even if the guy killed
himself painting it. It is merely decorative.
Hockney understood the violence within Bacon's paintings which
was, perhaps,
'the
natural
artistic language of the
times'. But he
did
not comprehend how Bacon
used
even
the
violence, which
put Christ on
the
Cross,
to examine human behaviour. To him,
aggression was part of the truth of man:
it could not be ignored.
When speaking of his Munich 'Crucifixion' of 1965, Bacon said he
knew religious people gave a different significance to the nailing of
Jesus on the tree. 'But as a non-believer,
it was just an act of man's

1 86
Francis Bacon
behaviour, a way of behaviour to another.' All Bacon's paintings of
violence had human connotations.
Other
artists
in
their genre were
to
use
the grammar
of the
mundane to create an atmosphere of tension and terror, as Bacon
did more and more, even congealing his model to a lavatory bowl in
one
triptych of 1964 which was eventually bought by the French
Government. Harold Pinter was such a one
in The Birthday Party
and The Caretaker^ he heightened and deformed the cliches of speech
and the
banalities of home
life
into
suggestions of the unspeak-
able. The
ordinary
in
his words became
the menace,
the
trivial
was translated
into the
threat. As
in Bacon's
portraits,
it was the
perception of the horror of the hotel and the wash-basin, the razor
and the safety-pin, the dumb-waiter and the newspaper, slowly torn
into
strips.
*Just as Bacon used the conventions of the room, the
portrait,
even
of
the
Crucifixion,
as
the
starting
point
for
his
repertoire of distortions', Bryan Appleyard once observed, 'so Pinter
used the conventions of the language of a dramatic "reality" for his.
In his work the shabby, gloomy, iconography of the nineteen-fifties
takes on the status of a myth of futility and of alienation within the
net of words.' In fact, Pinter and Bacon eventually encountered each
other
at a party. They got on and exchanged telephone numbers.
But when Bacon rang the playwright, he was writing and would not
take the
call. There was
a perfect pause which led
to no
further
communication. In the future. Bacon denied that he had ever liked
Pinter's work.
Within the whirl of paints.
Bacon's
descriptions of his
private
world were
seen
as an iconography of modern
times, an
all-out
assault
on
most
conventions. When
Keith
Vaughan
saw John
Osborne's play, ^ Patriot for Me^ at the Royal Court Theatre, which
had to become a club to bypass censorship by the Lord Chamberlain,
he dismissed it for its 'polymorphous aggressiveness. He attacks law,
society, Catholicism, homosexuality, people, his audience, anything
- so long as he does not have to commit himself to taking sides. He
is like Bacon as a painter.'
Vaughan's dislike of Bacon made him wrongly impute a similarity
to Osborne. The hero oi A Patriot for Me was a member of three
despised groups in the last years of the Habsburg Empire. Redl was

The Blood ofa British Man
1 87
lower-class, a Jew and a homosexual. But
it was his homosexuality
which led to his treachery in Austria. In a climatic ball scene, the
gays of Vienna dressed up as drag queens and mocked women and
high society. The Baron, who was their host, declared, 'This
is the
celebration of the
individual
against the
rest.'
It was
not.
It had
nothing
to do with
the
liberation of the
self from
the
closet.
It
recalled the ostentatious parades of transvestites which the young
Bacon had
seen
in
Berlin and
Paris, and which
the
old Bacon
avoided and never painted. His lunge at society was through its pain,
not
its
ostentation.
His
images
of homosexuality were
those
of
potency and
despair, not of weakness and
betrayal. Osborne had
openly attacked the dominance of homosexuals in all the fields of the
theatre, while Bacon never protested except in paint. His art was his
crusade, while Osborne's polemics often marred his plays.
Joe Orton
in Entertaining Mr Shane was
quite another matter.
Here was somebody who rejected the prevailing opinion of British
society
that
homosexuality was
a form
of sickness
or
a
clinical
condition, something
like kleptomania or alcoholism. The
British
Medical Association had diagnosed
it as something of a malady in
1955. Outside a gay 'marriage' of long-standing and faithful partners,
which might be acceptable in liberal circles, the practice of the love
between men was
a deviance. They were maladjusted. Above
all,
they should not flaunt
it. 'The behaviour and appearance of homo-
sexuals congregating blatantly
in public houses,
streets, and
res-
taurants are an outrage to public decency. Effeminate men wearing
make-up and using scent are objectionable to everyone.' This sexual
disorder was somehow linked with
social disorder,
as
it was in A
PatriotforMe. It did no good that some of the traitors to their country
of the
'fifties, particularly Burgess and Maclean, had been blatant
homosexuals.
For Orton and for his hero Mr Sloane, sex was enjoyable.
It was
natural, whether with a man or with a woman. There was no crisis
or problem about homosexual desire. Although he had a 'marriage'
with Kenneth Halliwell, who was to become
his murderer, Orton
remained promiscuous, living in the enjoyment of the cottage or the
public lavatory of the day. Cruising with anonymous men was sexual
liberation to him. Above
all, he was without guilt, as was Mr Sloane.

1 88
Francis Bacon
And that was the progression of Francis Bacon slowly throughout
the
'sixties. He emerged from
a
catharsis of grief and even
guilt
about the death of Peter Lacey in Tangier into a certain relaxation
in his casual relationships with other men, more and more accept-
able in metropolitan society, which was soon to earn the name of
'permissive'. If homosexualit>' had been 'the love that dares not speak
its name' to Lord Alfred Douglas and Oscar Wilde, in a London of
increasing tolerance
it was named openly, by Orton especially, after
the paintings of Bacon had already done so.
The law had not changed yet.
It followed the revolt of the blacks
and the young and the minorities during the decade.
Legislation
follows
opinion
just
as
trade
follows
the
flag.
It was
ironic
that
Bacon's pictures of personal protest seemed
to have become
the
banners of the masses, rebeUing against their universal maltreatment.
Certainly, Bacon avoided this interpretation of his work. His features
were never worn on T-shirts like those of Che Guevara. His revolt
was as withdrawn and significant as that of his friend Giacometti;
both of them were merely trying to alter the way the world saw the
human form
in
its
struggle
to
exist. Bacon would become
even
gloomier about his efforts than the pessimistic Giacometti. At one
dinner arranged by
their mutual drinking companion and model,
Isabel Rawsthorne,
in
1962, Bacon became progressively drunker
and more rambling on the subject of death and accident and futility.
When he
asked what
his
guest
thought,
Giacometti
said, 'Who
knows.^'
It was
too much
for Bacon, who
tipped up
the
side
of
the
table
until
all
the
plates and
glasses crashed onto
the
floor.
Giacometti shouted with glee. Instant action had solved the meaning
of existence.
More and mor^e. Bacon clung to his friends. He was looking for
another Lacey
in
his
life, and he was
to
find him by
the
time
Giacometti had his own retrospective at the Tate Gallery in London,
three years
after Bacon had. When
riding around
in
a
taxi with
Bacon and his new love, Giacometti patted the regular boyfriend on
the knee and said, 'When in London,
I feel homosexual.' Bacon had
such sympathy with Giacometti that he thought homosexuality might
suit his friend well, but it had hardly made Bacon particularly happy.
He once expressed his doubts enough to ask Giacometti, 'Do you

The Blood ofa British Man
1 89
think it's possible for a homosexual to be a great artist?' There was
no answer given to that.
Bacon continued to paint portraits of his close circle. As Andrew
Forge wrote, he was not looking behind the
social mask, nor was
he
creating
a
caricature. His
scandal was
that he claimed
to be
reproducing a likeness, while affronting every taboo and convention
of what a portrait really was. 'Sometimes his people seem to be
all
appearance,
nothing
else.
Sometimes
they seem
to be made
of
nothing but their own expression:
faces dominate heads,
features
dominate
faces.
Sometimes
the
features
themselves seem
to be
nothing but shine, sheen, surface, there in a flickering instant, not to
be grasped. Sometimes they are holes.'
To those critics like the late Peter Fuller, who took a moral stance
on Bacon's work just as Anita Brookner had. Bacon did not ideaHse,
but he denigrated in a universal way. 'It really does not matter whose
likeness he exploits: their face will emerge as that of "a gross and
cruel monster" - and nothing else. For Bacon, an individual's face
is
no more than an injured cypher for his own sense of the irredeemable
baseness of man.' Robert Hughes, however, praised Bacon's feats of
aesthetic self-removal, which enabled him to inspect the gums and
saliva of a screaming mouth as Monet did a lilypad. 'This distancing
has enabled Bacon to master his gruesome and convulsive subject-
matter ... the paint has a dreadful materiality, as though the grainy
cellular structure of die pigment, swiped with a loaded brush across
the canvas, were a smear of tissue.'
Yet the Holocaust, in Hughes's opinion, had made
it impossible
for
painting
to
deal
with modern
horrors.
Even De
Kooning's
'Women' and Bacon's male nudes looked
isolated
in
their
time.
'After Auschwitz, Expressionist distortion of the human body in art
seemed to many sensitive minds to have no future - in
fact, to be
little more than an impertinence or an intrusion, a gloss on what the
Nazis had done, on a vast industrial scale, to real bodies. Reality had
so far outstripped art that painting was speechless. What could rival
the testimony of the photograph.^'
Bacon transfigured the testimony of the photograph through his
personal pain and sense of loss. He had a sensitive mind, and he
knew that his paintings could never match the terminal degradations

1 90
Francis Bacon
of the Holocaust; and so he usually stressed that they were his own
obsessions, a diary of his
life, although he had also declared in the
'fifties that he was trying to paint the history of the past thirty years.
Yet his figures and portraits do appear to be those of people caught
in
a glimpse of agony, and
as
in pictures of the Crucifixion, they
came to represent in the suffering of one creature the suffering of all
creatures.
Bacon insisted that he was always interested
in behaviour. That
was why his
portraits had
their shine and dreadful
materiality of
paint and
illusion of movement. They were the bare
fact of flesh
seen at a desperate moment. Bacon did not denigrate his subjects.
He caught them off-guard, in shock,
at risk. He did not think the
human condition was irredeemably base, but that the individual was
in danger at each second. He was the translator to his age of the
revulsion from the Holocaust and the 'fear in a handful of dust' of
the
atom bomb,
through
the
contorted
features
and
tormented
figures of his friends. He wrought more than he said. His portrayal
of his sense of loss and hurt made millions of people see
it as their
own.

Freedom and Gaol Bait
It cannot be denied but outward accidents conduce much to
fortune: favour, opportunity, death of others, occasion fitting
virtue. But chiefly the mould of a man's fortune is in his own
hands
.
.
. And that this should be, no doubt it is much in a
man's self.
'Of Fortune'
by Francis Bacon, Lord Verulam,
Viscount St. Albans
Bacon once said that he only had two regrets in Hfe - two more than
Edith Piaf, who sang that she regretted nothing. He was sad about
giving up a couple of places: Millais' old studio in Cromwell Place
in
Kensington and
a
renovated
Georgian
terrace
house
on
the
Thames River in Narrow Street, Limehouse. That was when
I was
his neighbour, for
I had initiated the rebuilding of the
six bombed
and derelict houses on the waterfront, where the iron barges at their
moorings bumped against the back doors at high tide and made the
old brick walls tremble on their clay foundations. In wooden ships
hardly larger than these
lighters. Sir Walter Raleigh had sailed
to
found
his
lost colony
at Roanoke
in
Virginia and
to
search
for
Eldorado in Guiana. There had been dockyards
at Narrow Street
since Tudor times, and the setting sun turned the river bend into
the burning golden bow of William Blake, pulled towards the west
between the cranes and warehouses of the imperial waterway.
Bacon found the light too bright for him to paint there, as he had
also found
at Monte Carlo and
at Tangier. 'When the tide was in
and the sun was out', he told David Sylvester, 'there was a continual

192
Francis Bacon
glitter
inside
the
place'.
It was
too
difficult
for him
to work: he
needed a flat light. He made of his studio in Limehouse 'an almost
bare show-piece used only very occasionally for entertaining'.
It was
nearly as minimal as his
first garage studio of the early 'thirties, but
arranged with modern functional wooden furniture. The steel tubes
of the Bauhaus designs of his youth, however, were now brushed
rather than plated in chromium, and they served as the handrails on
the staircases. Oblong mirrors, rather than oval ones, were attached
to the pine or plaster walls. But there were no abstract or geono-
metric
carpets
to be
seen,
just the
stripped
boards,
even
in
the
bedroom.
It was Bacon's return to a tidy and ascetic ambience,
a
place of pleasure, not of labour.
His Soho friend, Daniel Farson, had
first begun the colonisation
of Narrow Street from the West End of London in 1958. Trawling
up and down the Thames to find a place of his own on the
river
among the docks, which were
still working then, Farson discovered,
as Raleigh had,
that there was
a
large population of native
East
Enders already living there. Between 90 and 96 Narrow Street, the
remarkable Mrs Dolly Fisher, who wore a monocle and dressed in
men's suits and smoked cheroots, ran a repairing yard for her fleet
of two-hundred barges, which still suppUed the wharves of the inner
city with goods taken from the merchant ships up-river at Tilbury
and Gravesend. Coal was unloaded by old cranes
at the dockside
beyond The Bunch of Grapes, which was
alleged
to be
the pub
called The Six Jolly Fellowship Porters by Charles Dickens in his
novel. Our Mutual Friend^
and which was
patronised
by Rogue
Riderhood when he was not patrolling the river banks for drowned
corpses to plunder. A little further downstream was the entrance to
the Regent's Canal Dock. At the height of the industrial revolution,
it had connected ty horse-drawn barge the factories built beside the
interior waterways with the salt-caked smoke-stacks of the steamers,
which carried
British goods from the Thames across the English
Channel to the seven seas.
Limehouse was
still a community of dockers and street traders,
immigrants and sailors. Its location, on a muddy bend of the eastern
river within the metropolis, made
it a special village in London with
a fierce sense of continuity and family and local pride. The Jews had

Freedom and Gaol Bait
193
settled round Hessel Street in the next parish of Stepney and sold
the best food in the neighbourhood. The Chinese, who had arrived
in dockland
after the Jews, had remained
in Limehouse and had
even inter-married with the daughters of the dockers. After gener-
ations of strife that verged on a racial war, the descendants of the
Chinese were respected and ran the best of the local restaurants, the
Old Friends and its allied eating-places.
What Limehouse had to endure was not so much from the settlers
or the passing seamen, but from the neglect of the Government after
the blitz had burned most of it during the Second World War. For a
quarter of a century, no administration had addressed the problem
of thousands of acres of bomb-sites and decaying small industries,
because
Limehouse was
a
safe
Labour
seat -
even
the
Prime
Minister Clement Attlee had represented
it and there was no need
to buy
the
vote. Some
appalling
concrete
towers were
built
to
accommodate the citizens in new vertical slums; but these had to be
destroyed within thirty years because they were uninhabitable and
dangerously
flawed
in
their
construction.
Actually,
the
blitz had
spared the walls of the few Georgian houses in Narrow Street, just
as they had survived the Ratcliff blaze of 1794, the most widespread
in dockland between the Great Fire of 1666 and the Nazi bombings
of the early 'forties.
At a time when the dockers were being laid off and their frequent
strikes were being broken by forced redundancies and the use of
casual labour at other provincial ports, the men of Limehouse could
only escape the dole by becoming street traders or fish porters up
the Hill of Despair at Billingsgate, boxers or petty criminals.
It was
this economic situation which led to the rise of the Kray Brothers to
the status of local heroes as well as the most notorious villains in the
East End since Jack the Ripper and the opium barons of Thomas
Burke's
novel, Limehouse Nights. The way
out of social
security
was to join the neighbourhood gangs, as
it has always been in the
deprived
quarters
of major
cities.
But
for
the young women
of
Limehouse, there was always work to be found in the shops or hair-
dressing salons, followed by marriage and bringing up children in a
society
that
still put
the
matriarchal
family on
the
level
that
the
ItaHans did.

194
Francis Bacon
The culture of dockland was centred on flowers and birds and
dogs and Victorian antiques. All traded illegally on Sunday, the day
of rest elsewhere
in the country:
the flower-market on Columbia
Street, with its boxes of potted petunias and marigolds auctioned off
for a few shillings after comic chaffering; the spaniel puppies and
budgies, goldfish and tortoises sold in Sclater Street by the Bethnal
Green Road, where the strong men flogged sets of china - fallen off
a truck on the way to Buckingham Palace, what else? - or aphrodisi-
acs like Spanish germanica to stop your woman leaving you because
you didn't feel up to
it; and the antique vendors, bartering from the
backs of lorries or hand-carts in Bermondsey and Bethnal Green,
with
their mementoes of past voyages carved or embroidered by
seamen
and
chaise-longues
and
settees
and
aspidistra-pots
and
hatstands - the souvenirs and remnants of Victorian respectability.
The docks had once been the focus of empire, busy and rich. And
in their going down, there was memory abiding. Some families of
dockers looked up their pedigree in Somerset House and could trace
it back to the ten generations that had worked on the waterside. And
there was
still a pride and circumstance in dressing-up for the big
occasion, the rare show in declining times. This was usually after
pay day on Friday and Saturday nights in the corner pubs, where the
costumes and the hairstyles surpassed those in many a West End
club or watering-hole.
There was
also
the
attraction
of the
privacy
of the
area,
an
antagonism to the law that had lured Verlaine when he had fled to
London with Rimbaud. They had found themselves least persecuted
in Soho and the East End, where most forms of human behaviour
were practised and tolerated. By their trade and lack of alternative
choice at sea,
safilors were used to homosexuality and to providing
favours
to gentlemen when they ran out of money on their shore
leaves. Nobody talked
to the
police, because the
lethal
sin of the
community was to nark or grass, to rat or
tell tales. Even the Kray
brothers never descended to homosexual blackmail, as Daniel Parson
testified
in
his
evocative but impersonal Limehouse Days, perhaps
because one of the twins preferred boys, saying, 'Little angel faces,
less evil-minded than girls.' The point was that no sexual inclination

Freedom and Gaol Bait
195
was taboo in Limehouse, unless the police got an
ill wind of it; but
the breeze rarely blew that way.
To his outpost in Limehouse, Farson invited his Soho
friends,
especially Francis Bacon and
the
fellow members
of the Colony
Room.
I lived next door for a while, hiring another converted sail-
making loft from Mrs Fisher while
I was beginning to renovate the
six bombed shells of houses towards The Bunch of Grapes. Eventu-
ally, my house was ready enough to enter and
I became the resident
of 88 Narrow Street.
I could walk across two terraces facing the river
and hop over a low wall to find myself outside the back of Farson's
home. Alone and immersed in writing a bardic novel called Gog,
I
was invited by him to a party one night. When
I arrived rather late,
there were
only men
there, Farson and
his Soho
friends,
a few
East Enders and more
sailors. Rather shy and heterosexual,
I was
embarrassed, but pleased to talk to Francis Bacon for the first time.
I had previously lived in Soho Square and had often seen him in
Wheeler's and the French Pub without daring to approach him. We
talked
a
little of our mutual love of the Greek
dramatists. On
a
second approach from another man,
I ran away.
It was not quite my
scene.
A month later, there was more of a drama. Early in the morning,
a banging at my terrace window woke me. A bleeding and naked
sailor from the Regent's Canal Docks was demanding to get
in.
I
opened the terrace door, patched up his
cuts, gave him some old
clothes and a little money, and sent him back to his ship through the
Limehouse dark.
I never said a word, but obviously there was some
rough business down among the ships. A month later,
I was woken
by thumping and running on the higher terrace above my head. This
time
I
did telephone
the
police, who rushed round immediately
to catch some burglars already reported by Farson for breaking into
his premises. The police surrounded the
terrace from
street and
foreshore, beUeving that the thieves could not escape. Then they
conferred with me. The noises off that
I had heard were the boots
of the coppers themselves. They had disturbed me. They had come
to put the handcuffs on their own wrists.
Life at Narrow Street was never without the incident and accident
and chance that Bacon loved. Daniel Farson solved his problems of

1 96
Francis Bacon
theft by importing a minder recommended by the Krays to live in his
attic with a ferocious Doberman. Such a remedy appeared to me to
be worse than the malady.
I went to the landlord of another local
community pub, The Black Horse, and made
it known that
I would
sign job references for any Limehouse criminal on his release from
gaol on the condition and his oath that he would not steal from his
honest job, whatever he stole elsewhere.
I would also represent the
neighbourhood to the local Council in
its just demands for better
schooling and lighting and pedestrian crossings, though not policing.
In return, I expected total protection from burglary and arson for the
six houses in Narrow Street, which were being occupied by me and
my friends. We both kept our side of the bargain for a decade, until
I
left my home. There
is
a deal of honour among East Enders.
Parson
recalled
that.
Francis Bacon found
it
out, when he was
talking to a young friend of Ronnie Kray's, who listed the charity
and benevolence of his patron. In the end. Bacon could not bear the
litany of praise, and exclaimed: ^"Fair touches the heart!"'
'It does, doesn't
it!' said the delighted wide-eyed boy. In fact, the
actor Stanley Baker had already introduced Bacon to the Kray twins
in
Tangier, and Ronnie Kray and two
of his henchmen
visited
Bacon one Sunday morning in his studio to deter him from suing a
friend of theirs for paintings that had not been paid for. Bacon was
persuaded.
The seductive privacy and lawlessness of Narrow Street could not
survive
its
colonisation from
the West End.
Particularly,
politics
crossed crabwise from Westminster. David Owen bought his house
next door to The Bunch of Grapes for three -thousand pounds, as a
poor doctor from St. Thomas's Hospital. By the time he had become
Foreign Secretary under the brief Callaghan Government, he had
swallowed up the adjoining ground area for a price ten times more
than he had paid for his original place, and he would pay a small
fortune to Francis Bacon, who had become his improbable neighbour
in the studio built above the derelict ruins of the old houses. Daniel
Farson, who had brought Bacon there, had
left by this time,
as
I
had. We no longer found at Narrow Street the rough and isolated
culture of the East End, but the beginning of a property explosion
extending
to
the
Isle of Dogs, which would
destroy the
area by

Freedom and Gaol Bait
197
valuing
it beyond
the means of the
local people
in the name of
reviving
its industry through newspaper presses and
office blocks,
relocated from Fleet Street and the
City.
It was another
blitz by
boom that gave good homes to few East Enders.
True to the culture of his place in London before he left for the
countryside, Parson ran a singing pub on the Isle of Dogs, which he
renamed The Waterman's Arms. He revived a version of the Music
Hall there with occasional turns by George Melly and Annie Ross.
Francis Bacon brought along his Tangier friend, William Burroughs,
and the Beat English writer Alexander Trocchi. Many in film and
show business came, Jacques Tati and Claudette Colbert, Groucho
Marx and Trevor Howard, Lord Delfont and David Merrick, Tony
Bennet and Shirley Bassey, Joan Littlewood and even Judy Garland
and Clint Eastwood. In a way, Farson was like Owen, destroying the
culture which he loved by introducing into
it the glamour and power
of other parts of other
cities.
Finally, The Waterman's Arms was
killed by
its own success. The more crowded
it became, the more
Farson lost the money, which ended in his opinion in the pockets of
his employees and his associates. Running a profitable club or a pub
in the East End needed the techniques of the Kray brothers, not of
an excellent photographer and a good writer, whom even the acerbic
Colin Maclnnes recognised as Realizing his own dream'.
As the
last survivor of the authors and
artists in Narrow Street,
until the film director David Lean was to move
to an old banana
wharf further down the road. Bacon used his studio occasionally as
a place to receive and entertain. In a hilarious story he used to
tell
to
his
friends such
as John Richardson, he even claimed
to have
encountered the next love of his
life
there. He
said
that he was
asleep and alone one night, when he woke to the noise of a burglar
in his bedroom. He did not behave like the Edwardian lady in her
mansion in the same situation, who announced,
*I am the only thing
of value in this room, and I am removing it immediately' - which she
did. Bacon's tactics were contrary. 'Take all your clothes off,' he said
to the burglar, 'and get into bed with me. Then you can have all you
want.'
That is how Francis Bacon used to tease George Dyer about their
first encounter in 1964. The story may have been just a funny one;

1 98
Francis Bacon
but Dyer had served time for breaking and entering in Borstal and
in Pentonville - a fact which emerged in court when Dyer committed
the
ultimate
sin of his background and
set up Bacon on
drugs
charges at the end of the decade. However they did meet in reality,
the choice of Dyer as a habitual lover marked Bacon's descent from
the older educated mentor to the younger rough trader. And at the
end of his life, he was to repeat his choice of a young East Ender to
see out his fortune and his days. No more the
raffish genteel
for
Bacon, but the lawless prole. In a way,
it was back to the grooms and
the stable-lads of his adolescence and Oscar Wilde's downfall.
Yet there was to be a sea-change in the law and in the attitude to
homosexuality during the
'sixties. With the Sexual Offences Act of
1967,
homosexual
acts between
consenting
adults
ceased
to
be
criminal. The
Obscenity
and
Theatre
Acts were
reformed
the
following year, leaving the only weapon of attack against works of art
or public performances, deemed by some
to be
offensive,
to be
private prosecutions
for blasphemy or
for procuring acts of gross
indecency. Bacon's paintings of men coupling like dogs had never
been prosecuted nor his Crucifixions of gruesome reptilian mangled
shapes. But his private sexual life had made him vulnerable to a gaol
sentence for the more than forty years of his adult life. It was almost
perverse of him to be liberated from the threat of the law and enter
of his own
will
into the
daily menace of the criminal mind.
Yet,
forced to act as a potential outlaw for so long, he had come to find,
as Oscar Wilde had, the company of wide boys and grafters more
interesting than of social climbers and scholars. He could not kick
the habit of his low Hfe.
Even more, the personal was the practice of his painting. George
Dyer became
his chief model
as well
as bedfellow, and Bacon's
representations
oT that man's
lusty,
fleshy,
evasive
nature would
dominate his work, even after the final tragedy in their relationship.
The 'Three
Studies of George Dyer
(on
light ground)'
of 1964
concentrated on the loose mouth and glancing look with his strong
jaw and quiff of hair. Two years later, 'Portrait of George Dyer on a
Bicycle'
is almost joyous, the trick of motion taken from Duchamp
and Balla seen in the series of bicycle wheels, so that Dyer seems to
be
riding a penticycle from
a
single
fixed handbar,
although
his

Freedom and Gaol Bait
1 99
profile is contradicted by a full face and single eye staring backwards,
and the force of his pedalling
is shown in the voluptuous curve of
calf and rump. But the despair of portions of the love
affair are
already evident in Tortrait of George Dyer Staring at Blind Cord',
of that same year. There Dyer's body congeals into his cross-legged
thighs as he squats on a curving sofa looking both ways like Janus,
and a tasselled cord hangs into the cage of isolation that surrounds
him. A spurt of white paint that may be spent semen gushes from
the buttocks of a shape kneeling in the worship of the flesh before
him beside an empty folding chair with a red seat, and a lying dog is
the voyeur, pointing his muzzle towards his master.
Two other portraits of ^George Dyer Crouching' and 'George
Dyer Talking' of 1966 show the corporeal challenge of the man. In
the
first, the curving sofa has changed to a pool with a void as
its
water.
Sitting on
his
heels
at
the end
of a
springboard, with
a
handkerchief knotted over his scalp, the naked Dyer waits to pounce
with a peering elongated face and a glittering animal eye on some
discarded
underclothes on
the
sofa
seat. His arched and parted
thighs emphasise his carnality, while his hanging arms and hunched
head
are
accentuated by
the
swipes
of his
lover's
brush. He
is
'Sweeney Among the Nightingales':
Apeneck Sweeney spreads his knees
Letting his arms hang down to laugh,
The zebra stripes along his jaw
Swelling to maculate giraffe
.
.
.
The silent vertebrate in brown
Contracts and concentrates, withdrawn

In
the
Tortrait
of George
Dyer
Talking',
the
naked
lover
is
squirming in the pleasures of confession. The blind cord swings
in double image
above, while
a naked
light bulb hangs over
his
penitential stool of interrogation. Bacon liked to say that 'jealousy is
the greatest aphrodisiac there
is', and the loving strokes of paint that
illustrate the body language of Dyer's embarrassment and equivoca-
tion are proof of his sexual power over his
artist lover, while the
pages of his transgression stream out of him over the carpet.

Francis Bacon
Bacon's
other
portraits
of
his
close
friends
demonstrated
his
growing supremacy in that branch of his art. In particular, 'Portrait
of Isabel Rawsthorne Standing in a Street in Soho' is a masterpiece.
The road
is a sandy arena with smeared touring cars and people,
black windows and blue restaurant awnings beyond, contained within
the metal poles that might construct a tent for a reception. A black
dress hides a bulky and commanding figure, swirling forward, while
the same
jets
of white
paint blobbed
onto her
hip
indicate
her
sexuality. The
dark wipes
of Prussian
blue
similar
to
the
dress
material seem to shadow and disfigure the proud and adventurous
face, which is described around a mouth as wide as a gash that runs
into the neck and
a surprised
glance from eyes with dead black
pupils. White
streaks on brow and nose and chin make the bone
come through the skin so that the wild hair flying behind appears as
a fright wig mounted on a skull. The whole figure
is monumental
and subversive, sensual and condemned by her context.
It
is as
if
Isabel Rawsthorne was incarnated by Bacon as the Lady Life-in-
Death of Coleridge's poem of The Ancient Mariner.
Henrietta Moraes was
also
painted
frequentiy
at
this
time by
Bacon from the nude photographs of her commissioned a decade
previously from John Deakin. Her face is almost simian with sunken
eye-sockets and jabbering mouth, while the pink flesh of breast and
belly and buttock is given the full lush brush-stroke of a Rembrandt
or the finer outline of Ingres. Black splodges at knee and top of thigh
indicate flaw or maltreatment, while in the version taken from her
photographs of the 'Study of Nude with Figure in a Mirror of 1969',
she has drawn up her legs while lying on an oval glass table -top, her
ape -like face oblivious to the man in a trilby hat staring at her as in
one of the Soho peep-shows, where naked women pose behind one-
way mirrors for voyeurs, at a pound a time. She also served as the
model in a series of portrait heads of her painted at the same time
with similar monkey-like surrounds of black hair and eyebrows and
enclosing blinded sockets or closed lids and teeth chattering inside
an orange or dark smear.
Lucian Freud was another
favourite
subject of Bacon
in
their
mutual appreciation of each other's disparate art. In the first of two
triptychs, Freud sprawls with one shoe pulled up, on a kitchen chair

Freedom and Gaol Bait
201
placed upon a crimson rostrum with an armchair back. The extreme
mobihty of his features in conversation and of his arms emphasising
his points appear in the smudged outHnes of skin and blurs of flesh
and repetition of features that was becoming Bacon's signature. The
second triptych of 1969 left Freud on a kitchen chair, but in front of
the
rails of a brass bedhead and confined within the framework of
one of Bacon's sentry boxes. The nose was more prominent and
bulging with
flaring
nostrils,
the mouth was
loosened from
the
cheeks and
lost beneath
the
chin,
the
intimacy gone
within
the
devices of distance. Yet two years before, in the Tortrait of George
Dyer and Lucian Freud', the lover is transfixed by the brilliant chat
of the fellow artist, as they raise or draw up their feet under them-
selves on a purple banquette, and a cat on a dark-green square table
watches with interest the two-faced Freud talking so animatedly that
his face swerves to right and left simultaneously.
Although Bacon was accused of exploiting or denigrating his close
friends in his portraits of them, John Russell believed that he turned
them into heroes and heroines. In the ancient Greek stories of the
Gods, so treasured by Bacon, the scoundrel and the hero were the
same. The cunning tricks ofJove trying to bed Danae in a shower of
gold or of Ulysses trapping Cyclops to get his crew alive out of the
giant's cave under the
bellies of sheep - so often the themes of
previous painters - were devices as wily and desperate as any con
game perpetrated by a Soho survivor or an East End burglar. Bacon's
portraits of Isabel Rawsthorne and Henrietta Moraes, of Lucian
Freud and George Dyer, set them in the frame in the grand manner
of Velazquez or David, even if their shapes were contorted to reveal
an inner imbalance and knavery. Bacon metamorphosed his women
into Furies or Amazons, his men into a Priapus and a Janus, arrogant
and potent, devious and
finally doomed. There was some myth in
his intentions. Outside his studies of the Sphinx, he saw in those he
loved a classical significance.
Although he now maintained that he had given up story-telling in
his pictures along with horror and exaggeration, his Munich 'Cruci-
fixion' of 1965 and
a painting after Muybridge and
studies
for a
series on bullfighting all showed that he had not wholly abandoned
the drama of history in his
art. In his previous Crucifixions, Bacon

202
Francis Bacon
had not centralised the action, but in this case, the appaUing butchery
of a genetic experiment in the middle
is watched by two grinning
men in blue suits and floppy white straw hats on the right, while a
naked girl on the left gives a cursory glance at the scene of massacre
on the bed which she has just quit, and of mutilation in the middle.
On the bed gibbers a slavering and spattered beast with abounding
human arms crossed behind a Ku Klux Klan hood, perched above a
face that is all blood and teeth and skull. In the centre, two trotters
in splints run up to an eviscerated human belly, and from
it, tripes
and innards ascend to a vague carcass sitting on the red throne of
power. Beyond the businessmen watching such a spectator sport on
the night, a Nazi ghoul skips forward on green pin legs, his face a
void of hurried blackness, his peaked cap in a shroud that leads to
an armband of the swastika, which complements a curious rosette of
a blue cross within white-and-red petals, also worn by the beast on
the bed. When Bacon was accused of making historical points by
inserting the Nazi armband, he would not answer any more than the
jesting Pilate. He merely said,
*I wanted to put an armband to break
the continuity of the arm and to add that particular red round the
arm.'
Even though the figures on his triptychs were carefully arranged
to indicate each other. Bacon insisted that they were locked in their
own solitude. He hoped not to tell a narrative, but to portray a great
number of figures without linking them. He admitted that the Nazi
armband in the Munich ^Crucifixion' was taken from photographs
of Hitler standing with his entourage, but he asserted that
it was
included
*as part of trying to make the figure work'. The problem
was that if a story were being told between one figure and another,
it
would begin *to cancel out the possibilities of what can be done with
paint on
its own'. The
art of painting was
in such
a
state
in the
present day that
it was difficult enough to do one figure on its own.
In his triptychs, the images played off one against the other w ithout
leaving their own space. He chose threes because the balance was
better. Fours seemed too many and more was like Mickey Mouse:
he might go on for ever.
Yet Bacon had added the symbolism of the swastika and of the
red, white and blue rosettes to his Munich 'Crucifixion'. These were

Freedom and Gaol Bait
203
explicit statements about what he thought of Nazism and the patriotic
fervour of waving the
flag during the Second World War. He was
telling a
story and making a moral judgement. And
in his
'After
Muybridge - Woman Emptying Bowl of Water and Paralytic Child
on All Fours' of the same year, he placed his contorted and crouched
figures on the raised bar of a circus ring, set against lurid purple and
orange and red panels, appearing to be the endless and futile human
action of running like a trapped dog to move a turnspit and roast the
meat on the
fire. The throwing of the water by the woman in the
picture was as useless as pouring a full glass over Etna.
The
studies on
bullfighting, however, were
a major departure,
which signalled Bacon's first attraction to the Spain of the mainland
in 1969, where he saw the sport a
little as Hemingway had done,
'like boxing, a marvellous aperitif to sex'. His two versions of 'Study
for
a
Bullfight',
the
first
of which used
to hang
in
the
Senior
Common Room
of the
Royal
College
of Art,
used
his
current
iconography - the circular arena containing the rounded and lunging
bull,
spewing
out
the
white
spurts
of
its
potency;
the shadowy
matador evading with face and cloak the onset; the crowd as voyeurs
contained
in one segment
like
a mirror of the orange
billboards
around; and a brown pool of disappointed lust trickling off the base
of the canvas. And yet, as Bacon had really tried to abandon drama
in his work, he
felt the weights of history and association were too
heavy for him to complete his proposed triptych on the bull ring, and
he called the project off.
He was mainly engaged during 1965 on a proposed exhibition in
Paris that excited him still more than his retrospective at the Tate. It
was to be at the Galerie Maeght in the following year. To him it was
the verdict on his career: he wanted acceptance or acclaim in the city
where he had lingered and been excluded as a young man, but which
he had always admired as the centre of art in all the world. As John
Russell wrote after talking to him:
Bacon
still holds the view, now incomprehensible to most people
under
fifty, that if a work of art looks well in Paris,
it has passed
the supreme
test. In believing this, he
is concerned not so much
with today's judgements as with the unsmiling tribunal of the past.

204
Francis Bacon
Paris
is the place where the great things were done -
or,
if not
done, nurtured - over the last hundred-and-fifty years. Relations
between the painter and society in Paris had been almost uniquely
harmonious, in that to be a painter at
all in Paris was to pursue a
valued
activity.
Bacon
has
a
small
private
treasury
of French
insights
.
.
. and I suspect that he prefers good French conversation
to almost any kind of formal entertainment. He loves the radical,
unsparing character of French talk; and he loves the prodigality of
imagination which has been shown by the best French painters,
the vaulting ambition, the total seriousness, the readiness to dare
anything, the instinctive knowledge of how to pace a career.
In Paris, Bacon was to meet an art critic, who was later to become a
close friend, Michel Leiris. He was struck by a passage in a book,
which
Leiris had
written,
about
Baudelaire
and
his
concept
of
beauty.
It was an idea that dated back to the Christian heresies and
the concept that Lucifer or sin was a creative force, and that Saint
Judas enabled the Crucifixion to happen by his betrayal of Christ.
There could be no beauty without the wound or the ugliness. There
could be no perfection without the
spoiled work,
the
flaw
in the
mirror, the fly in amber. A work of art had to bear within itself 'the
drop of poison, the rogue element of incoherence, the grain of sand
that will foul up the entire system'.
That is what Leiris saw in Bacon's sinister paintings. These had a
counter-purpose and
contained an
anti-image.
Paradoxically,
the
more brutal and depraved they appeared to be, the more the painter
was trying to rehabilitate the strange beauty of modern times. Bacon
was vulnerable to that argument. He had never believed that he hurt
his
friends by
their
distortion
in
his
portraits:
he was
trying
to
describe their true behaviour. He once asked David Sylvester to tell
him Vho today has been able to record everything that comes across
to us
as
a
fact without causing deep injury to the
image.^' When
the
critic answered that Bacon might be expressing both love and
hostility towards the
sitter, he said that
it reminded him of Oscar
Wilde's remark: 'You
kill the things you love.'
It might be that. He
did not know.
In refusing
to admit
that
his
triptychs
told
a
story or
that
his
portraits passed a message about the human condition. Bacon took

Freedom and Gaol Bait
205
more and more to maintaining that life for the artist had become a
game.
It was a version of Huizinga's masterpiece, Homo Ludens, in
which man's capacity to play
is the art of his
life. 'The public now
looks on painting as a means of distraction/ Bacon told the readers
of the popular Sun newspaper, 'and therefore the artist must make
it
more and more distracting by painting Hfe as he sees
it in different
facets. What makes
it even more fascinating, and incidentally more
difficult, for the
artist
is that if he
is to stay a good
artist, he must
deepen the game, stay ahead of the field and find a variety of new
ways in which to describe life and emotion round him.' But the game
of painting was not cricket. There were no rules. Tou should steal
from anybody and anything that will help you.'
The fact that Bacon often destroyed more paintings than he kept
was the result of his persistent experiments and efforts. 'Like most
artists, he frequendy takes a picture too far and past the point of no
return,' the Sun reported. 'Unlike most artists, he has the courage
to destroy these. He says that this frequently happens to his best
paintings, as they start with inspiration and then he takes them too
far in his enthusiasm.' He even agreed with David Sylvester that if
people from the Marlborough or his friends did not come
to
his
studio and remove paintings he would go on working on them and
mar their quality and destroy them
all. If painting were a game,
at
the moment of his victory through chance and skill, the result had to
be snatched away, because he would certainly lose the match in extra
time. As he said in 1963, what he was always hoping to do was
'to
permit the one picture which will annihilate
all the other ones and
concentrate everything into the painting'.
Marlborough Fine Art was more and more successful with the
portraits
which
were
being
snatched
from
Bacon
before
their
annihilation. In his exhibition during the summer of 1965, seven of
the
nine
paintings on
display were
sold
for about
five -thousand
pounds each along with other pictures from the gallery's storeroom.
The
total
value
of works
sold
during
the
exhibition was
sixty-
thousand pounds. But Bacon continued
to show his generosity by
donating his
art to his friends. He even gave a portrait of Lucian
Freud to Bernard Walsh, the proprietor of Wheeler's, in memory of
hundreds
of splendid
lunches
there,
at which John Deakin and

2o6
Francis Bacon
Freud and he would
deliver acid remarks about the distinguished
members of the Thursday Club, coming down
the narrow
stairs
from their lunch above - the Duke of Edinburgh and Peter Ustinov,
Larry Adler and James Robertson Justice and the Court photogra-
pher Baron Nahum. Tou have to look at
it three ways to see
it's
Lucian,' Walsh said of the portrait, 'but
it
is recognizable.' He did
not hang
it
in
his
restaurant, however, where
it might deter
the
clients from appreciating their sole a la meuniere, but in his London
home.
At the exhibition
at the Galerie Maeght, Bacon did receive the
recognition that he desired in Paris. 'If the French like my work,' he
had said in a rare admission, 'then
I shall feel that
I have, to some
extent, succeeded'. His reception was greater than his hope. He had
painted
sixteen
portraits
or
studies
expressly
for the
Paris show,
and he had included his controversial triptych, 'Three Figures in a
Room' of 1964, which depicted
a man with meaty, concupiscent
curves on his shoulder blades and buttocks astride a lavatory bowl, a
sprawled male nude on a blue armchair, and a twisted one scratching
his hair and perched on a bar stool, reminiscent of the later 'George
Dyer Talking'. The general praise included one acute observation
on Bacon; 'His work carries the mark of his life rather like a person
whose flesh has retained the scars of an accident.' There was also a
truth on his current influence. There was no country in the world
where young
artists were
not
imitating
him.
'Francis
Bacon
is
certainly the
artist who has
cast the
strongest
spell over
a whole
generation.'
After
this
seal
of
approval
in
France,
Bacon
began
to
win
international prizes. He particularly appreciated the Rubens Prize in
1967, presented to him in June in the master's birthplace in Siegen
in Germany, because the inspiration for his voluptuous flesh tones
had come partly from that source, although more from Courbet. He
donated
the
prize money
to help
the
restoration of art works
in
Florence. He was also one of three British artists to win a prize at
the Pittsburgh International Exhibition at the Carnegie Institute in
that
city
in the same year, and he then exhibited another twenty
works at Marlborough Fine Art in London. There he received the
kind of criticism of his pictures that he deserved, but did not accept.

Freedom and Gaol Bait
207
Taint
is handled, sometimes slashed, with a kind of sophisticated
fury. Yet there is no reassuring sophistication about the overall effect
of these latest works of Bacon. Nor is there about the napalm bomb,
a massacre
in the Congo, or the empty heart of the tortured
city
dweller. This is the art of a moment in history when many have lost
their bearings. It is not pleasant, but it will live for it says much about
the human dilemma.' Another critic, Nigel Gosling, thought that the
input of his painting was like being hit in the crotch, but found the
painter personally generous, charming, fanatically sincere and incor-
ruptible by any temptation yet invented.
He will go on and on compulsively probing an image, like a child
exploring the site of an extracted tooth
.
.
.
He explains that he
is 'trying to create formal traps which will
close suddenly at the right moment, recording this fact of a man as
accurately as I can'. The right moment chosen by this psychological
impressionist is the one which reveals 'this fact of a man' exposed
to these two forces.
The sense of duality and tension between contradictory forces
is
always
strong
.
.
.
His own work
is
always
rich
in opposing
associations. His macabre, grotesque imagination
is Gothic but
expressed
in
full,
rhythmic Renaissance
forms. A dog
slipping
across the corner of the retina is pinned down into permanence. A
figure turning as it crosses the room is transformed, like Lot's wife,
into a pillar of paint. The random flailing of copulation is composed
into a single complex
.
.
.
Tension breeds violence, and violence
is everywhere in Bacon's
work. You
feel the presence of a
sensibility so delicate that the
gentlest stimulus is an assault.
'I believe that anything that exists is
a violent thing. The existence of a rose is a violence'
.
.
.
As usual the big unclothed figures dominate the show. In spite
of their
careful, balanced
placing - sometims
inside
a kind
of
containing
frame -
Bacon's
subjects
always
retain
a
voyeurist
element. They are not nude but naked, caught in a moment of
unaware privacy
like some secret snapshot taken for evidence
at
the final judgement.
They are deeply sensual. Their curves swell passionately or split
under the attack of devouring intimacy. The
cell, the
grass, the
carpet become an arena
for
a combat stained with homosexual
eroticism. The figure which sprawls on its back, one leg up, on the

2o8
Francis Bacon
ugly modem couch seems to be waiting with an abandon which
has nothing admirable or enviable about
it for another helping of
what has already flattened
it - pleasure or pain, vision or debase-
ment.
It all seems one
.
.
.
Bacon has dredged deeply and agonizingly into the spring of
existence. What he brings up
is murky, rich, even rank, but
it
is
certainly one aspect of truth.
I believe that future generations will
continue to be moved by
it, and even, which might alarm Bacon,
find
it totally beautiful.
The Tate Gallery held, also, in 1967, a retrospective of one of the
painters most admired by Bacon - Marcel Duchamp. As Russell said
of him, Bacon might not be displeased if he ended as the last man in
the world playing the last hand that would put the other players out
of the game for ever. Duchamp had already cleared the table by his
rigorous
attitude of mind, by his logic and
his
historic sense,
his
decisiveness and his disdain for self-promotion and making a career.
Bacon thought that Duchamp had successfully changed the tech-
nique of art by not being avant-garde and trying to create a new art.
He made symbols of the figurative,
'a sort of myth of the twentieth
century'. Although Bacon preferred Duchamp's philosophy to
his
individual works,
I saw him at that retrospective exhibition studying
each picture with the
intensity of a
kestrel hovering over
a
field
mouse. He had
always had
the power of ruthless and
selective
choice,
discarding the whole of Matisse,
for
instance,
except
for
^Bathers by
a
River',
painted
during
the
First World War. He
swooped on what
he
could
use,
concentrating on
this
or
that,
excluding the whole show.
In
this case, he moved about with
his
spring-heeled,
cocky walking
in
pursuit of Duchamp
in
general
rather than in particular. When it was pointed out to him that strange
affinities appeared in his work with painters he was known to dislike,
he would snap back in defence of his magpie instinct of stealing the
best and the brightest from
all the other
artists' nests, 'Remember
that I go to see everything'
One old literary theme that had long haunted him made him place
his
lover George Dyer
in
a
special
painting
in
1967,
'Tript\ch
Inspired by T. S. Eliot's poem "Sweeney Agonistes"'. The Sweeney
poems had always been favoured by Bacon, and his relationship with

Freedom and Gaol Bait
209
Dyer had increased his involvement w^ith him in that world of drifting
and drinking, casual acquaintances that might lead to crime, bought
sexual
favours and
incursions from the
night. The
central panel
bears vv^itness to a murder and robbery in a Pullman sleeping-car on
a train; a tangle of bloodstained clothes suggest unspeakable violence
and Sweeney's line,
^I knew a man once did a
girl in/ To the
left,
two human shapes lie back in exhausted billows on a rostrum within
a circular cage, while the head and shoulders of a third watcher or
sexual participant is sketched below an open gas cooker and beside
a pack of cigarettes. On the right, a detective on a telephone reports
on a howling humping of male bodies in their rutting. This was the
year when
sexual
intercourse between consenting
adults became
legal in Britain.
It was a last outcry against the blackmailer and the
informer.
Bacon went on painting his lover obsessively. Three pictures of
him
in 1968 were variously called 'Two Studies of George Dyer
with Dog', 'Portrait of George Dyer in a Mirror', and 'Two Studies
for a Portrait of George Dyer'. In the first, the naked man slouches,
leg on thigh, on a kitchen chair within Bacon's usual circular arena
and cube of cage, but his other face, the right cheek and frontal lobe
eaten away, stares at us as if a formal bust on a mount at the front,
while a dog flops in a doormat at his feet. Later Bacon said he liked
the dog best in the painting.
It looked as though
it had had a really
good run. It was exhausted with its tongue out, just lying there. The
second study sets
all on a circular purplish carpet and
splits Dyer
twice
in two;
his
real body, turning on
a chair towards
a mirror,
squelches halfway into a mess of warped movement, while the mirror
image of sky blue divorces his profile in an azure tear, neck and ear
separate from eye and mouth and thrusting neck and nose. The
third shows a bored Dyer looking away on his chair from an ashtray
and oblong carpet scattered with cigarette stubs, while a portrait of
him
as
a carnivorous ape-like Sweeney devours
a bloody morsel,
asquat and
betailed and
nailed
five
times
to
the canvas within
a
canvas to point his bestial behaviour and condition.
Yet perhaps Bacon's most penetrating description of his personal
feelings
for Dyer was
contained
within
another
triptych,
'Two
Figures Lying on
a Bed with Attendants'. The nude male
figure

210
Francis Bacon
moves behind the back of another hunched on a bed under a slatted
Venetian blind and dangling knob. Both raise their arms to strike or
plead. On the
left, Dyer of the rounded hips and shoulder-blades
sits on
his kitchen
chair, watching his
sexual
action with
a web-
footed wading bird breaking from its glass case to plunge its beak in.
On the
right,
a distorted
face
leers from crumpled clothing on
a
transparent table, while a dark-suited man with a watch peers and
gibbers at the central event. Above him, a painting on a canvas of a
man lurching forward into his own shadow, counterpointed on the
left by a second canvas of another shadow striding upright, casting
only a small dark semblance on the ground.
Bacon was now painting his personal life. He stressed that fact on
every occasion. He claimed his triptychs told no story, and that the
three panels were unrelated, and that each figure was intended to be
solitary - yet these examiners of the sad, fierce coupling on the bed,
this scrutiny from the edges did speak of Bacon's nervous state of
mind. He
feared Dyer's detachment from
their love-making,
his
performance without involvement. He was
also
frightened of the
intrusion of his intelligent and artistic friends such as Lucian Freud
on the
intensity of his private
life. Dyer had
a rough charm and
an easy
social manner; but he was no
intellectual and subject
to
mockery, even by Bacon. The
strains
in
this
affair of four years
began to show in New York City, where both the men went in the
November of 1968
for an exhibition of twenty of Bacon's works
including two triptychs, one of which was 'Two Figures Lying on a
Bed with Attendants',
at the Marlborough-Gerson
Gallery. They
were to stay for ten days
at the Algonquin Hotel of literary fame.
They had recently been separated for several weeks, because Bacon
had just returned from visiting his remarried mother and
ill
sister
lanthe in South Africa.
Bryan Robertson had made the selection of Bacon's painting for
the show, and other friends were in New York, particularly Rodrigo
Moynihan and his wife, and John Richardson. The gala opening was
even attended by Princess Margaret and Lord Snowdon, who had
photographed
Bacon. He was becoming an unwiUing
darling of
society; but he could bite back. In one hilarious story told by George
Melly, Bacon accepted against his instinct an invitation to a lunch

Freedom and Gaol Bait
211
given for him by a woman of power and influence. He was carefully
placed next to a beautiful, but inarticulate young man. Told that this
American Adonis was the nephew of Jackson Pollock, he fixed him
with his green and lizard gaze, and
said: 'So you're the old lace-
maker's niece ^ are you.^'
Like Muriel Belcher, Bacon used to refer to younger men as 'she'
in
his
waspish moods.
His
deteriorating
relationship
with Dyer
reached
a climax
at a club restaurant called Charade where they
were dining with Richardson and the Moynihans. Dyer tried to buy
the drinks with the few dollars Bacon had given him. 'Don't listen to
her,' Bacon said. 'Not a penny in her pocket. She can't buy a drink
for us.' Dyer had suffered enough from being baited by his lover in
front of his smart friends. He felt ill at ease off his own territory. So
he stormed back to the Algonquin Hotel and found the bottle of
strong sleeping-pills which Bacon always used. Dyer removed from
his
lover's
suit the
roll of dollar
bills provided by the owners of
Marlborough Fine Art for the painter's American expenses - ten-
thousand
dollars
in
all - pocketed
the money, found
a
bottle of
scotch,
drank
it
to
swill down
the
barbiturates and
left
for
the
Charade. He was making the plea for love and help that adolescents
make when they attempt suicide, wanting in reality to be rescued.
Dyer only reached
the door of the
hotel room before
collapsing
across
the
threshold. Bacon found him two hours
later. He was
unconscious, but
still breathing. So Bacon telephoned the Moyni-
hans and Richardson, hiding
his horror under
his
levity.
'Guess
what.^' he said. 'She's committed Susancide.'
What was to be done was more the question. Scandal had to be
avoided. Dyer recovered enough to make his way to the window of
the hotel and threaten to jump out. Bacon told him to do so, adding
with some exaggeration:
'It's the twenty-fifth storey so you won't feel
a
thing.' Dyer backed
into
the bedroom and was
taken
off by
limousine to the airport, where the owners of the Marlborough had
bought air-tickets in a section of the First Class to transport their
prize artist and his wayward friend home.
The
quarrels and
the
reconciliations
of the
lovers
continued.
Some friends of Bacon like Daniel Farson found Dyer a charming
and
hopeless man
with
impeccable
manners,
far
more
of
the

2 1

Francis Bacon
gentleman than the minor villain. But most of them put him down
and tried to exclude him, jealous of their own relationship with an
artist, now receiving the wealth and recognition that he had long
deserved. A clique of close friends surrounded him at the Colony
Room, almost throttling him with their concern and wounding the
intruder Dyer with their barbed conversation. The Cockney play-
wright Frank Norman even tried to write on Bacon's Soho life at the
time, but all he could record on bits of lavatory paper were epigrams
from the master, saying that he had never had any love in his life and
wanted none. *A11
I do is cast my rod into the sewers of despair and
see what I come up with this time.'
To distance himself from Dyer, Bacon bought his lover a cottage
in Kent, but Dyer could not
live there without him and sold the
place
at
a
profit. He became more and more
disorientated. One
morning Farson was woken at his house in Devon by Dyer and a
party of friends who had driven down
all night from a Soho club
called the Apollo. Farson thought that Dyer usually looked
half-
asleep, but now he excelled himself, stumbling out of the car and
blinking with surprise at the empty sands below.
'I thought', he said,
'we were going to Brighton'.
The worsening situation led to the denunciation and first arrest of
Bacon in his studio. On 2 September 1970, the police took him to
Chelsea Police Station and charged him with possessing cannabis.
Released on bail the next day, his trial took place at the beginning of
June the following year. Detectives with sniffer dogs had investigated
the
artist's place
at Reece Mews
after receiving information from
George Dyer. The report of the evidence at the trial read:
At Inner London Session yesterday, Francis Bacon, 61, of Reece
Mews,
Chelsea,
whose
works
hang
in
the
Tate
Gallery
and
throughout
the world, was found not
guilty on
t\v'0 charges
of
possessing cannabis.
The jury heard that the police found a 12-inch pipe stem among
underclothing in a chest of drawers.
And in the studio under a pile of clothes, a police dog, 'Colonel',
sniffed out 2.1 grammes of cannabis wrapped in silver paper in the
bottom of a paintbox.
The police tip-off had come from Mr George Dyer, who had

Freedom and Gaol Bait
213
been employed by Bacon as a model and general handyman for
eight years.
Miss Ann Curnow, prosecuting, said police led by Woman Det.
Sgt. Carol Bristow raided Bacon's studio at 8.25 a.m.
Sgt. Bristow said that Bacon answered the door and when shown
a search warrant, said: 'May I ring Lord Goodman.^'
Miss Curnow asked: 'Who is he.^'
Sgt. Bristow:
'I understand he is a soHcitor.'
She
continued
that when shown
the
pipe stem Bacon
said:
'Look,
I have various people here and
it must belong to them.
It
must have been here for years.
It is not mine. What is it used for.'"
When the cannabis was found in his studio, Bacon said:
'I do
not smoke cannabis.
I do not smoke at all.
I am an asthmatic
.
.
.'
Bacon
in
evidence,
said
he
did
not smoke
because
of
his
asthmatic condition. In 1956 in Tangier he made two attempts to
smoke cannabis but suffered from violent asthmatic attacks and
had never smoked it since.
He added:
'I would not allow people to smoke it in my premises
if I knew what they were smoking, with the law as it stands.'
Writers,
artists,
students
and
people
of the
art world were
frequent callers at his studio.
He said he had employed Dyer for eight years. Dyer,
ill through
alcoholism, often made allegations against him when drunk. Dyer
had told him he had been to Borstal and jail.
Twice Dyer had attempted suicide.
Bacon continued: 'When he
is drunk he feels
I don't pay him
enough. Sometimes he has broken down my front door and broken
into my flat.
'I pay him a regular wage but that doesn't suffice because of his
drinking and he comes and asks for more. Sometimes
I give him
some, sometimes
I don't.'
On Aug. 27 last he declined to give Dyer any more money and
he learned later that he had gone to the police.
Bacon said the pipe stem belonged to a man who had visited his
flat five years ago and was now living abroad. He found the stem
on the floor after the visit and put it away and forgot all about
it.
He said he had no idea where the cannabis
in his studio had
come from.
Bacon
had
pleaded
not
guilty
of unlawfully
possessing
2.1
grammes of cannabis resin on Sept.
2
last; and having unlawful
possession of an unknown quantity of the drug on or before that
date.

214
Francis Bacon
After his discharge Bacon said:
'I bear no animosity towards Mr
Dyer.
'He is a very sick man.
I still employ him and
I have kept contact
with him while he was in hospital.
*I
shall continue
to employ him.
Naturally
I am relieved
this
whole business has cleared my name. It has been a great strain.'
Even after the denunciation and the trial, Bacon had gone on paying
and loving the importunate Dyer. Their relationship appeared to be
bound
to end
in tragedy,
as had the one between Joe Orton and
Kenneth
Halliwell, which had many of the same
characteristics.
Halliwell had tried to commit suicide five years before he murdered
Orton
in
1967:
their
relationship
together had
lasted
for
fifteen
years. Halliwell used anti-depressants such as Valium and barbitu-
rates, which he mixed together in a large
jar. As Orton's fame and
earnings
grew
through
Loot and
his
other
plays,
Halliwell
felt
snubbed by his lover's new friends from the theatre and the social
world, and
he would
rage
against
the way
they made him
feel
inferior. Pathetic attempts to put his collages on display ended in the
cellar of an antique dealer at the wrong end of the King's Road, with
two of the pieces withdrawn for fear of prosecution and described by
Joe Orton as 'a nude Venus and a picture called "Cosy Couples" -
several sections of young men cut from physical culture magazines
juxtaposed with large flowers and distant views of horses'. Halliwell
was jealous and possessive and wanted to play the housewife in a
permanent relationship, while Orton was promiscuous and sociable
and seductive, content to cruise and guiltless over any casual pick-
up - as was shown by his hoUday in Tangier of that very lethal year
in the apartment where Tennessee Williams wrote Suddenly Last
Summer. Bacon
fiad enjoyed the same
delights with Peter Lacey
there,
the
easy venal Arab boys and
the
conversations with
the
European queens in the cafes: but Bacon had come back to London
battered and bruised by his lover, who had died alone in Tangier,
where Halliwell had become violently angry and had attacked Orton
for the
first time, hitting him about the head. Finally that hot and
oppressive summer of Orton's success and HalliweU's despair at his
own
failure, he exploded
at
his
lover picking
at his
sulking with

Freedom and Gaol Bait
215
comments such as, 'You're getting to be a fucking Mater Doloroso,
aren't you?'
It had been too much to bear. Their bed-sitting room might have
been modelled on a Bacon painting or an early studio of his. Austere
and
arid and
comfortless,
it had Venetian blinds and an
electric
heater and a scrubbed linoleum floor, while the walls were covered
with huge collages of Renaissance and Egyptian art and Greek and
Roman gods and headlines from the gutter press - the melange of
reproductions of masterpieces and myths and clippings that inspired
Bacon. And the final frenzy of hammer blows to Orton's head had
flung spots of gore
all over the artwork and had converted his skull
to shattered brain and meat, while his killer's nude body, drugged to
death with Nembutals, was lying bald and blood-spattered on the
linoleum.
As their love became
self- destructive. Bacon continued to paint
Dyer:
a head dark and shadowed under nose and chin peering at
Isabel
Rawsthorne,
also doomed by
black
outlining and
a
spot
beneath her jawbone. 'Three Studies of the Male Back' of 1970
showed the strong curves of Dyer's torso and upper arms turned
away from the artist; twice to shave his own cream- flecked face seen
in a bathroom mirror while he considers or sharpens the razor; once
to read the newspaper, his naked shape central and dominant and
indifferent, as a black shadow seems to run down the single support
of the swivel chair into a pool of black matter. But the last 'Study of
George
Dyer', painted before Bacon's mammoth
retrospective of
one hundred-and-eight works including eleven large triptychs that
opened
at the Grand
Palais
in the October of 1972, was another
examination of indifference and of sex divorced from feeling. A large
foot treads down the discarded pages of a newspaper with headlines
of gibberish -
the
capital
letters
of non-communication.
Dyer's
sitting body
is thicker now, like an ageing middleweight boxer, and
his lip flaps loosely beyond his nose in complaint. But in a mirror, a
calf and thigh can be seen, echoing Michelangelo's Adam on the
roof of the Sistine Chapel in Rome.
Before leaving for the Paris exhibition with Dyer and John Deakin
and Muriel Belcher of the Colony Room, Bacon confirmed to the
art critic Richard Cork that he was picturing his personal experience

2 1
6
Francis Bacon
and intended to paint an autobiography. He had been offered a great
deal of money to write one, but he had refused. 'What's the point,
unless you
are
Proust.^' He hoped
to
crystallise time through
his
series in the way that Proust did with his novels: he did not say that
he had already done so with his portraits of the
'sixties, particularly
those about his relationship with Dyer. This intended autobiography
would probably absorb his energy until his death. Although grateful,
in the mornings, to wake up at all and find himself still alive, 'even
when one is in a strong sun, casting a black shadow, death is always
with you'.
Cork was aware of the physical passion behind Bacon's words and
gestures, the arms shooting out to stretch up and clutch the meaning
of what he was trying to say, the
fists clenching when he declared
that he wanted 'to paint a nose with
all the violence of a real nose'
and to 'make things as raw as possible'. He disclaimed the anger in
his work and
stated
that, while he
did
not consciously look
for
violence, he had less veils than most people to screen him from life,
so that every time he entered a butcher's shop, he was 'made aware
of the violence which custom protects us from'. There was great
beauty in the colour of meat to a painter, and the large stores such
as Harrod's were great halls of death with all the meat and fish and
birds lying dead there.
Interestingly, as Bacon usually discounted all but the most discern-
ing critics close to the aims of his work, he confessed to reading the
reviews of his past shows
at the Marlborough and
realising
that
nearly all of them were bad.
It did not concern him; he knew he was
outside the mainstream of modern art. What did concern him were
current influences and trends, particularly among the avant-garde:
Young

but of course
it won't be new unless you have the compost of the
past as well. The past nourishes you, and denying that source of
nourishment
is like cutting off one arm to make the other better.
I've never felt the need to reject the past.
I feel

very strongly.

takes such a long time for things to fall into place. And there's no
point in worrying about what you
feel you ought to be doing in
terms of the
historical evolution of art,
either. You can only do
what your impulses demand, and that doesn't mean
I see myself as
the
last of a
line. The
possibilities of oil painting are only
just
beginning to be exploited: the potential is enormous.
Dyer's death on a lavatory bowl in Paris, v^ith blood pouring from his
nose and mouth, was
to
cheat Bacon of his triumph
there. He
committed suicide at the third attempt in the posture of the man in
'Three Figures in a Room' of 1964, painted by the artist shortly after
the beginning of their long
affair. Denham Fonts, once loved by
Michael Wishart, had died from an overdose of drugs
also on a
lavatory in Rome; as Wishart told me, taking drugs is constipating and
overloads the
heart. When he had
tried
to turn Bacon on
to the
psychedelic drug LSD, Bacon would not take it, agreeing that he 'did
not want to break the cellophane between oneself and insanity'. Yet
Dyer had now broken the cellophane between himself and mortalit}^
The self-destruction of Denham Fonts had once almost killed the
emotions
in his adorer, Peter Watson, one of the
first patrons of
Bacon as a young artist. Now Bacon was stricken too. He had not
heard
this
last scream
for assistance, he had not seen
this
act of
defiance against him on the eve of his elegant opening in Paris, the
first British painter in history to be so honoured in France. Apocry-
phally, he was said to have heard the news on the ceremonial steps
of the Grand
Palais, where he showed no emotion.
Actually, he
heard of the suicide when he returned to the hotel in the evening
where the concierge said to him,
'I have something terrible to tell you,
your friend's committed
suicide.' 'Eh
bien,' Bacon
said, 'where
is
he.^' 'Eh bien,^ the concierge said, 'he's in the mortuary now.' He had
taken an overdose of sleeping-pills, vomited in the basin and died on
the lavatory seat. That night, Bacon screamed at La Coupole, where
David Hockney told him how sorry he was about Dyer's sudden end.
'He took out a large handkerchief and let out a big scream. He said
all he could do was laugh or cry.'
Kierkegaard
stated
that
suicide was an
act of courage and
of
affirmation.
Certainly,
Dyer's
act was
a
rebuttal of Bacon's own

2 1

Francis Bacon
intense fear of death. And in striking out against his lover's glory and
his
increasing
indifference
and
a
personal
sense
of
inferiority,
George Dyer,
like Kenneth Halliwell, did
kill the thing he loved.
Although Bacon lived on for twenty years, the wound from this self-
murder never healed.
It bled inside him;
it could not be staunched.
If he did not admit to guilt, he did to fate and the Furies. Tact is a
ghost,' he used to say, and he would always be haunted by this deed
of love gone awry.
A poem had been written the previous year by Lawrence Raab,
inspired
by
one
of Bacon's
paintings
and
called
'Figure
with
Hypodermic Syringe'.
It showed how the
artist's private grief and
particular world cried out to much of the world.
The man at the door has something to sell.
The prowling cars have someone to find.
Room's closing in, nothing left to take.
It's all the same, go in, go out, get on.
- I had a friend once but he died.
After a while even bleeding
begins to soften and goes away.
The man at the door is promising nothing.
I only sell the stuff; you take it from there.
- I had a woman once but she left.
The face on the wall is no face at all.
Any moment the real thing may arrive.
We do what we can with what we have at hand.
Who can say where
it all begins.
- If I wasn't here I'd be somewhere else.
The window goes in, the window goes out.
The striped cloth creeps across the bed.
Cracks open in the wall. Needle's
in the arm, knocking's on the door.
- If only the hurt would keep the pain away.

Fact Leaves its Ghost
Fact leaves its ghost.
A frequent remark of Francis Bacon,
the painter
Bacon
told David
Sylvester
that he had
a very unfortunate
life,
because
all the people he had been really fond of had died. He did
not stop thinking about them. Time did not heal. 'But you concen-
trate on something w^hich was an obsession, and what you would
have put into your obsession with the physical act you put into your
work.
Because
one
of the
terrible
things
about
so-called
love,
certainly for the artist,
I think, is the destruction.'
After
the
international
success
of his
exhibition
at the Grand
Palais - the magazine Connaissance desArts published the results of a
European
poll which placed Bacon
at the head of the
ten 'most
important living
artists' - Bacon returned to London and tried to
exorcise Dyer's ghost in the fact of his work, to bypass his obsession
in the physical act in paint. His first picture was a triptych called 'In
Memory of George Dyer'.
It was a return to the past, the colours
more subdued, the composition
less
startling.
'It would seem that
under the tempestuous and agonizing pressure of his memories',
wrote one of his leading critics, Lorenza Trucchi, 'Bacon sought to
set down some of the more oppressive images, so that while in the
two side panels - one with a figure crouched in an acrobatic pose,
and the other with the image of Dyer reflected mirror-fashion, like
on a playing-card - the style is
still concise. In the central panel
it is

220
Francis Bacon
decidedly
realistic and
detailed, adding up
to
a
sort of poignant
inventory of "things": the stairs with the threadbare runner and shiny
handrail, the light bulb, the bell, and the newspaper on the floor -
almost a grasping at "things" in order to prolong in more concrete
terms a memory
still painfully alive, an anguish
still rooted in flesh
and
blood.'
In
tliis
physical need
to
call back
the
dead, Bacon
appeared to record his own arm behind the figure of Dyer, repeating
the familiar gesture of putting the key in the latch and opening the
door of the house together. 'This
is one of the most moving details
in all of Bacon's work' - perhaps his only howl from the heart. When
Bacon was asked whether he derived the turning of the key in the
front door from
Picasso's
Dinard
bathing
figures
opening
their
beach-huts, he said
it was more the influence of T. S. Eliot in The
Waste Land,
'I have heard the key turn in the door once and turn
once only.'
Another painting dedicated to Dyer, 'Portrait of a Man Walking
Down Steps', showed the buried lover coming downstairs at Reece
Mews
like an undulant
feline, holding onto an edge of the black
square rail beyond. It is a cold and black and formal farewell. Death
has separated the lovers. Bacon recognises the fact. Trom this point
on in many works - and especially in the stricken "Self-Portrait" of
1972, where the painter depicts himself in an empty room, dazed
and
trapped
in
a
hopeless
hope,
and
in
that gloomy
requiem,
"Triptych,
August
1972" -
a
true
meditatio
mortis
is
revealed.'
Trucchi linked Bacon with Heidegger and
Sartre,
asserting with
them that beyond the body was silence, nothing. She quoted him in
saying 'death
is the shadow of life, and the more one
is obsessed
with life, the more one is obsessed with death.' Yet the most efficient
exorcism was eroticism. The art of inevitable death yielded again to
the urge to
live. In the three years after Dyer's death. Bacon also
painted 'Three Studies of Figures on Beds', 'Triptych, August 1972'
*Two Figures with a Monkey' and 'Triptych, March
1974',
all of
which showed the sexual battle at full force. As Bacon had remarked
to Sylvester about an orange triptych painted the year before Dyer's
suicide,
'I wanted to put two figures together on a bed, and
I knew
that
I wanted them in a sense either to be copulating or buggering.'
But he did not know how to do
it so that it would have the strength

Fact Leaves
its Ghost
221
of the sensation which he felt about it. Now his homage to Dyer and
his memory of his lover gave him the strength of the sensation he
had once had.
The brutal facts of Dyer's ending were met directly in Triptych,
May-June 1973'. Against black backgrounds set up like screens with
a white arrow pointing to the action, Dyer
is seen vomiting into a
basin on the
right, staggering with head and shoulders across the
central panel - his shadow a bat-like angel of death on the carpet
and slumped in an animal crouch on the lavatory bowl on the
left,
abased in his final spasm.
It
is the suicide caught in reverse, three
action stills read from right to left, as if a police surveillance camera
had replaced the
tragic happening to the jury of our eyes. Bacon
later admitted that this triptych was the nearest he had ever done to
something which had a story, and that was how his lover was found
dead.
Yet Bacon's most poignant tribute to Dyer was a triptych of his
lover and himself and Lucian Freud. As the painter said of his triple
studies of single figures or heads, he usually did them Hike police
records, looking side
face, front face, and then side face from the
other side'. In this case. Dyer in his characteristic nude pose with a
foot balanced on one knee, does move his head sideways to look at
Bacon in the centre, but a frontal mug shot of him
is pinned to the
wall behind his body. Bacon sits alone in the middle, his face loose
with
grief, staring forwards
as does Freud in the right panel. But
Freud's mug shot
is
side
face, drawing the viewer's
attention
to
Bacon's
isolation. The
divisions of the
triptych
give the
effect of
Dyer looking hopelessly across the abyss
at the two
living
artists,
who look forward at the living eye, while behind them, the simulated
photographs
recall the
terrible memory of the past that snapshots
can provoke.
When he made a selection of his work for a book on his art written
by his friend from Paris, Michel Leiris, published in 1987, Bacon
devoted four
full pages to three triptychs and four individual
self-
portraits,
all painted in 1972, and intercut with the furious circular
arrowed
motion
of the
copulating male
'Figures on
Beds',
also
painted
in
that
year. These
introspective
studies showed
a man
shocked by grief and pain with a blubbering mouth and black eyes

222
Francis Bacon
lowered
in despair. The jaunty curl of the forelock
is ragged and
matted on the forehead. And in one self-criticism, the artist
is seen
with an injured eye, as pink and swollen as a third cheek on his face.
As he
told
Sylvester,
he had been
doing
a
lot
of self-portraits
^because people have been dying around me like
flies and I've had
nobody else
left to paint but myself.
It was
a
little mad
to paint
portraits of dead people. Their flesh had rotted away. 'Once they're
dead you have your memory of them but you haven't got them.'
The self-portraits revealed the inner reality of Bacon's mourning
for his friend. He was not an expressionist painter, as he said. He
was not trying to express sorrow about somebody committing suicide;
but he did admit that perhaps his grief came through without his
knowledge. His outward manner showed nothing. Leiris found him
as he always seemed
to be, with
a clean-shaven and chubby and
tormented
face, as roseate as that of a Georgian empirical philos-
opher, that seemed to reflect a 'wide-eyed astonishment as well as
an
intelligent stubbornness and -
allied
to
a hidden
fury -
the
sensitive distress of a man who has not forgotten that he was once a
child whom almost anything could move
to wonder'. His manner
indicated that everything might be called into question, his light walk
seemed almost on the point of breaking into a dance, while his casual
and
irreproachable
clothes
denied
his
late
nights
and
spattered
studio
life. In sorrow or in anger at death. Bacon faced
life in the
studied manner of English good breeding, however much
life itself
had let him down.
At the Bacon exhibition
at the Grand
Palais, Leger's work had
also been on show. For one English
critic, Guy Brett,
it was hard
to
imagine
two more
dissimilar
spirits. While
Leger's
paintings
expanded.
Bacon's
fearfully contracted.
'Bacon's world seems
to
contract inwards Yrom the walls of the room into the crushed faces.
His desperate imagery
is combined with complete respect for the
traditional
limits
of European
painting. Bacon
has
said
that
the
subject of his painting
is "the History of Europe in my Lifetime".
He has made of it a cramped, violent stage, which reflects Europe's
obsession with itself and refusal to look outside.'
Yet the leading French critics such as Pierre Schneider had found
that Bacon had radically changed modern art, which had destroyed

Fact Leaves
its Ghost
223
the postulate that pictorial signs could signify reality. Now there was
a painful divorce between the literal image and the subde curtain of
paint. Bacon's aggressively tried to bridge that void, but the violence
did not belong to the artist nor to his subjects.
'It is the violence of
representation. Modern paint
is the ghoul, not Bacon.' When the
artist said there was no torture
in his paintings, he was
right. As
Schneider wrote:
Since the
'sixties, the painting
is the torture. The scale
is often
epic, but portraiture is always at the centre, because
it states, in its
most
radical terms,
the
contradiction between the autonomy of
paint and
the
identity of the
subject,
corralled,
attacked
from
several sides at once. The light is switched on suddenly, to catch
reality by surprise.
It tolerates no protective shadows;
it is relent-
less, uniform, lidless - the light of cross-examination. The curious
affinity of certain recent
triptychs with Toulouse-Lautrec
(and,
through him, with Japanese screens) stems from Bacon's interest-
ing reliance on the sharpshooter's passionate precision. Nothing in
the setting is left to chance
.
.
.
The contortion characteristic of Bacon's forms
is a hanging on
to a quarry that tries frantically to escape. There ensues a seesaw
struggle in which writhing pigment achieves a succession of brief
and partial triumphs: those moments when we forget
it because
it
has suddenly become, with a kind of savage presence, a foot, an
ashtray, a cheekbone, a knee clasped in that inimitable British way.
And at once the image dissolves into brush- strokes. Thus painting
can be said, in Bacon's words, 'to be and not to be'.
What makes Bacon frightening is not his subject-matter but the
fact
that,
in
his
practice, he shows
art and
actual
living
to be
*unmixable and
inseparable'. The council of Chalcedon,
in AD
456, thus defined the nature of Christ:
I can think of no more apt
definition for Bacon's paintings.
Indeed, his fascination with the Crucifixion may well be attrib-
uted
to the
fact that
Christianity's central mystery provides
the
pattern for the mystery of painting:
reality must allow itself to be
put to death by paint in order to be resurrected as image. Hence
perhaps Bacon's jubilation at the disappearance of painting in our
time:
it proves
that 'painting
is
just beginning'. The image
will
have
reality only as long as we do not mistake
it for reality; and
when we do (when we want to touch
it), the image relapses into
paint. And so on indefinitely, within each picture
.
.
.

224
Francis Bacon
Tertullian called this period (those glacial three days before the
Resurrection), 'refngerium interim'. No artist has given us a grander
version of this ghastly moment of suspension, which
is the Chris-
tian legacy to our post-Christian age. The great areas of colour,
stilled by nocturnal brilliance, should clash, but do not. They are
petrified while the dice are rolhng.
Such important and
incisive criticism persuaded the Metropolitan
Museum in New York also to offer Bacon an exhibition there. Less
than
a
w^eek
after
his
opening
at
the Grand
Palais, Bacon was
delighted to tell the press that he had been asked to show his work
of the past five years at the Metropolitan, even without the Museum
Director travelling to Paris to see what was on show there. It was an
even more remarkable honour than the French exhibition,
'for the
Metropolitan is essentially an Old Master Collection - the National
Gallery and the British Museum rolled into one - and living artists
are only shown there under very special circumstances.' The Times
further stated that Bacon's success in Paris reflected credit on his
mother
country.
French
intellectuals were
likely
to
think
rather
better of Britain
after a disturbing visit to the Grand
Palais, than
they did before - not that Bacon cared a fig leaf for what The Times
or his mother country thought.
Bacon's refusal to allow Dyer's suicide to prevent his inaugural
success in Paris, and his insistence on continuing to see the Soho
friends he had brought out with him, provoked a mistaken reaction
to his apparent callousness. The concern and perhaps
guilt, which
were wrenched from his brush in his memorial pictures to George
Dyer, would never have been displayed
in his
life, which was
for
living. His
grief was
private; he
lived
for the
contradiction of
it.
Daniel Farson
\V'as shocked by John Deakin, also dying himself of
lung cancer, writing in a letter of the celebrations of Bacon's success
in Paris as
'a blur of brandy, illness and purple hearts', and merely
ending
a post-postscript with
the words, 'How's about George's
demise.^' But such apparent brittle indifferences were merely a brave
face to death, such as Bacon adopted to mask his admitted fear of it.
This casualness that concealed commitment deceived some of the
painter's more rigorous friends, particularly the extraordinary Vera

Fact Leaves
its Ghost
225
Russell, an emigre actress from
St.
Petersburg, who had married
Bacon's leading critic John Russell. The artist did not live up to her
exacting standards over Dyer's death. He seemed to be enjoying his
fame and friends too much, and he would not exhibit in her Artists'
Market in Covent Garden. She was also becoming estranged from
her husband, and when she had a serious accident to her leg. Bacon
was suspected of having used
that mishap and
their
ill-feeling
to
produce a group of paintings involving a bloody and injured limb.
Such misunderstanding of Bacon's feelings for the death of his
lovers and friends was proved untrue by the demise ofJohn Deakin
after an operation at the Westminster Hospital. Bacon had agreed to
subsidise his convalescence, first in the Ship Hotel at Brighton, then
on the Greek island of Poros. Deakin died in Brighton, but named
Bacon as his next of kin. This seemed a dirty trick to the artist, who
could not stand
all the formalities. Deakin had enough money for a
decent funeral, for Bacon had already given him the proceeds of the
sale of one of his
pictures. But
characteristically, he
told Daniel
Farson a joke about identifying the corpse of the Soho photographer.
When the sheet was lifted from the body, *his trap was shut for the
first time
in
his
life'.
It was most
certainly him. Farson
did not
misinterpret such a bleak jest, but printed in his memories of Soho a
glowing and rare tribute by Bacon to Deakin's art at a posthumous
exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum:
'his portraits to me
are the best since Nadar and Julia Margaret Cameron'.
Bacon spent more and more time at his studio in Paris at 3 Rue
de Biraque in the Marais.
It was not only because of the acclaim
from his exhibition there, but a mark of his increasing friendship
with Michel Leiris.
It was a continual pleasure
to Bacon,
as John
Russell wrote, 'to have that great lord of language only a short walk
away'. The
artist had already had
five previous mentors in his
life:
Roy de Maistre who had taught him control in painting; Eric Hall
who had contributed an appreciation of the finer arts and tastes of
life; John
Rothenstein with
his
imaginative
sympathy and
broad
analysis of European
painting; David
Sylvester with
his
rigorous
scrutiny of the
artist's
intention and
execution; and John
Russell
himself, who was leaving the Sunday Times in England to work as the
art critic for the New York Times. In his book on Bacon's work, so

226
Francis Bacon
rich in
its historical analysis, he paid tribute to the artist for being a
good neighbour in Kensington for thirty years. Francis Bacon 'has
never finished a bad book, he has never entertained a dull thought
and he has never made a commonplace remark. Of how many of us
can that be said.^ In life, he has set his own standards; and neither as
a beginner nor as the most sought-after of living European painters
has he fallen below them.'
Michel
Leiris
set Bacon
very much
in
the mode
of French
Existentialism, while praising his originality. The raison d'etre of an
artist was not to entertain, but to make his personal statement in the
chaos
of existence. Although Bacon
insisted
that he was
only
a
painter playing games and conveying no messages, there was a real
presence
in
his
figures, which had
nothing
to
do
with
theology.
The spectator had direct entrance into his pictures not unlike the
experience of making physical love. This presence was ambiguous
and alluring, wild and shining, an intense and sensuous delight that
could repel by the force of its impact.
Bacon's aim was not to produce a decorative painting, but to use
the
canvas
as
an
experimental
assertion
of certain
realities. He
differed from the Surrealists, who were obsessed with dreams and
the imagination, by seeking an immediate method
to describe
his
sensations, although he did admit that Sigmund Freud's work and
Surrealism had changed his own sense of realism, 'because we've
been made
more
conscious
of how
realism
can
draw
on
the
unconscious'. He was
also removed from the Impressionists, with
their open windows or keyholes of pictures, flattering the eye with
some luminous detail of the ordinary world, and from the Cubists
with their structured compositions of what they held to be the true
shape of things. Bacon now denied any influence from Expression-
ism, eschewing cframatic lighting and theatrical or satirical
effects.
He painted his subjects in the harsh flatness of naked electric bulbs
or the glare of the sun at noon. For Leiris, Bacon insisted on putting
all his cards on the table and paid cash down.
'The space
in which we breathe and the time
in which we
live
here and now:
this
is what we
find, almost without exception,
in
Bacon's pictures, which seem to aim at the immediate expression of
something immediate
.
.
. They make the spectator feel as if he were

Fact Leaves

227
there^ or even
is actually there (inside the picture, not simply in front
of it).' In this total participation, the viewer entered into the state of
Roland Barthes's phrase, that
is, where the past
is replaced by the
present.
Bacon's
mature
paintings were
close
and
life-size
and
seemed
to
rest on a
floor that extended over the bottom edge of
the picture onto the
floor of the gallery
itself. Bacon changed the
museum visitor into the voyeur of an autobiographical moment of
crisis, in which he was trapped and enclosed in the small room or
confining cage of the
central
figure. Bacon's
art represented
the
space in which we actually live.
Moreover,
it represented 'our time as well'. Bacon used personal
objects
to point out topicality and the passage of the hours. Like
T. S. Eliot's people, whose lives were marked out in coffee-spoons.
Bacon's were measured
in cigarette-ends and shaving cream,
the
instant scatter of the everyday. The clothes were always common-
place and crumpled, the naked figures stripped in casual or sexual
action.
It was painting devoid of distancing.
It was a paring down
like the quick choice between numbers before the rapid spin of the
roulette wheel. Yet although Bacon claimed to have removed from
art
its reUgious and moral dimension
in order to play a game of
chance, there was a ritual in his pictures, as there was with croupiers
in a
casino,
a form of 'blank
liturgy' without any transcendental
reference. Bacon and
Giacometti's games
consisted
of trying
to
become the most accurate and effective figurative
artists by risking
the interplay between the theme and the artist's image produced by
his sensations. This created the necessary tension in a picture, which
suddenly seemed complete.
To
Leiris,
Bacon's most
characteristic canvases
suggested
the
rhythm of life. There were incandescent parts in them which seethed
with energy in contrast to neutral parts where nothing happened.
As there were solo breaks in jazz rhythms, as Stephane Mallarme
counterpointed Dionysian frenzy with Apollonian calm,
so Bacon
threw the dice like a hurricane into the neutrality of the abyss. His
figures had to have the personal mark of his throw, his cast of the
paint, to make the spectator believe in them. In using distortion to
translate the reality of the sitter to the viewer. Bacon never risked
it
for dramatic or even aesthetic reasons. He saw his models in their

228
Francis Bacon
inner turmoil, already attacked by stress and decay, somewhat as in
the process of the magic portrait of Dorian Gray in Oscar Wilde's
tale, where the
flesh remained perfect and the portrait of the
real
man showed the ravages of time.
The most alive of Bacon's pictures seemed to Leiris to result from
a paradox: distorted figures were combined with a fairly naturalistic
background. 'Such a marriage of hot and cold cannot fail to arouse
attention and heighten the sensation of presence.' The geometry and
pattern of the setting put in place the whirling energy of the figures,
which seemed
to
lose
their bone
structures
in swoops and
turns.
This was the art of immediate sensation, and even when the subject
was called a Crucifixion,
it used the myth no more than James Joyce
used the ancient Odyssey in his modern Ulysses - Bacon was shortly
to paint two pictures ofJoyce's hero, Leopold Bloom, sitting side by
side in felt hats, each talking to a duplicate of himself. Bacon even
told
Leiris that his use of the
triptych was no longer inspired by
Grunewald or Cimabue, but by the panoramic screens of certain
cinemas. He was determined as an ageing man to divorce himself
from his early religious beliefs and influences.
Yet the distortion in Bacon's painting approached disruption and
Andre Breton's definition of beauty for the Surrealists: 'Beauty will
be convulsive or not exist at all.' Even so, the flesh of Bacon's models
was so warm and elastic and voluptuous, his paint was swept on so
directly from the sensitive brush, that the artist not only remodelled
the forms, but kneaded the very matter of life
itself. As a loaf rises
from dough, the reality of his forms emerges from his bold manipu-
lation and gambles with paint and sensation. 'His chief driving-force
is a vehement desire to grasp reality
.
.
. This frantic, almost panic,
urge produces an emotional breaching of boundaries which intro-
duces, into the texture of the canvas, the disturbance felt by the artist
himself.'
Bacon
tried
to define what he meant by realism
in
a
letter
to
Leiris, which he wrote in French with the help of a friend - he spoke
excellent French,
but wanted
a
precise
language
in
his
missive.
Realism was 'an attempt to capture the appearance together with the
cluster of sensations which this particular appearance excites in me'.
He
also
stated
that the most profound expression of realism was

Fact Leaves
its Ghost
229
always subjective. There were inner realities to be revealed. Realism
in art must not be confused with the simple wish to translate things
which objectively existed.
It had to be creative.
It had continually to
be re-invented. It did not represent;
it might establish a truth beyond
what might
necessarily be
seen.
Leiris
particularly admired two
pictures which were
to be painted
in
1982;
a male
torso with
a
thrusting penis and buttocks as shoulders, the legs clad in cricket
pads, and a female trunk crowned by two breasts after a drawing by
Ingres. These were not slices of life, they were disturbing presences.
Bacon's
devices
for
creating
a
real presence were by
oblique
intensification - a shadow becoming a dark pool emanating from the
figure, a mirror reflection denser than the original, the omission of
heads or limbs, the emphasis on splints or hypodermic needles to
rivet attention, the unbalance of the position of the body as in a man
using
his
foot
to
turn
a
door-key. These
tensions
through
the
interplay of contrasting energies and objects achieved 'the brutality
of fact', which Bacon stressed in his interviews with Sylvester, and
also as he often said to Russell - 'fact leaving its ghost'.
He wanted the help of accident and chance in his painting - by
the use of drips or
slips of the brush; by wiping with rags or by
throwing on paint or sand or dust for texture; by adding circles and
blots, arrows or whiplashes of white paint; by inserting the incon-
gruous
object or throwaway
detail
that marked
the
arbitrary and
haphazard nature of modern living.
It was the rebellion of caprice
and disorder against the containment of chaos. And there was an
element of myth in some of his paintings, taken from his reading or
his Jungian unconscious - particularly in a 'Triptych' of 1976, where
the centrepiece is of a Prometheus ripped apart by a bird of prey, his
guts flowing down into a bowl, with other bestial shapes feeding on
the innards, and a chalice dripping a veil of blood off the foreground
in the suggestion of a communion cup. This and another picture
painted four years later, 'Carcase of Meat and Bird of Prey', seemed
to Leiris to achieve the tragic resonance of a sacrificial scene through
the majestic quality of the structure and of the colour of the meat.
Although Bacon declared that he had no message to deliver, Leiris
found, from personal experience,
'that his pictures help
us, most
powerfully, to feel the sheer fact of existence as
it is sensed by a man

230
Francis Bacon
without
illusions'. The dazzling nakedness of the very moment of
the paintings seemed
to be 'images in keeping with the inanity of
our situation in the world as ephemeral beings, more capable than
any other living creatures of brilliant and pointless ecstasies'. They
corresponded to that modern state of mind that used to be call mal
du siecle - and in that way, the personal painting of the private artist
did correspond to a universal perception.
In the same way as Samuel Beckett, whose plain sentences were
like 'the discreet emanations from a mouldering peat
fire', Francis
Bacon expressed 'the human condition as
it truly and peculiarly
is
today'. Consequendy, he could be called a
realist, however strong
the tragic and mythological element was in occasional paintings and
in references
to the Sphinx or Prometheus or the
Furies,
to the
Oresteia
or 'Sweeney
Agonistes'.
'As
an
authentic
expression
of
Western man
in our time,
Francis Bacon's work conveys,
in the
admirably Nietzschean formula he himself has coined to explain the
sort of man and artist he is, an "exhilarated despair".' Indeed, when
Hugh Davies had commented that Bacon's figures in isolation were
like those trapped people of Camus in L 'Etranger, or of Sartre
in
Huis Clos, the painter had said,
'I have nothing to express about the
human condition, but everyone reacts to their times.'
It was imposs-
ible
to work
in an
ivory
tower.
'I
look
at
everything from
cave
paintings to contemporary art and I'm influenced by them all.'
The especial importance of the opinions of Michel Leiris was that
they related the French analytical approach to a personal awareness
and knowledge of Francis Bacon, who approved this interpretation
of his intentions. In his continuing autobiographical frame of mind.
Bacon painted two portraits of Leiris, which were to be included in
the book about him. They show a lean-faced man with generous and
sensitive lips and 6yes that express sympathy and inquiry. Talking of
the two paintings to Sylvester, Bacon said that the one less literally
like
Leiris was more
poignantly
like
him.
His head was
rather
globular, but
in one portrait
it was long and narrow and seemed
more real to Bacon, who intended that the pictures should look like
the
subject. 'There's no point
in doing a portrait of somebody
if
you're not going to make it look like him.' But by making the features
artificially narrow. Bacon seemed to capture the Frenchman's acute

Fact Leaves
its Ghost
231
sense of logic and
fine power of reasoning. And
in
the second
portrait, the deconstruction of the features bore tribute to the current
French thinking of Barthes and Derrida as well as to Bacon's love of
the X-Ray images in Positioning in Radiography.
In his portraits, Bacon tried to trap the energy, mental or physical,
within the appearance. He even occasionally talked of emanations
from people, of fact leaving its ghost, which he tried to hunt down.
He was not now painting so many self-portraits, as two very good-
looking people he had known in the past had turned up in his Hfe
again. One was the American explorer and photographer in Africa,
Peter Beard, and the other was a tall young Canadian from Montreal,
Barry Joule, who served
as the model
for the male
torso
in
the
cricket pads, along with a news photograph of David Gower at the
crease. In 1975, Bacon twice painted 'Three Studies for a portrait of
Peter
Beard', and
for
once,
the
physical beauty of the
features
transcended the added white
circles and blobs and furrow marks
of orange and pink and white. Bacon admired the bone structure
behind the face and did not dissolve
it, as he had so often before in
his portraits of Isabel Rawsthorne or himself. He talked to Beard of
death
as the only absolute
certainty.
Artists knew they could not
defeat
it and were very aware of their own annihilation.
*It follows
them around like their shadow, and I think this is one of the reasons
why artists are so conscious of the vulnerability and nothingness of
life.'
Barry Joule had
first met Bacon while washing his car in Reece
Mews. He had left his English-Canadian father and Irish mother in
Canada and had settled as a neighbour to Bacon, who leaned out of
his kitchen window to ask a question.
It led to a close and lasting
friendship between the two men, which was only to end with the
painter's death
in Spain - Joule heard
the news on
his farm
in
Normandy, while waiting for Bacon to join him from Madrid. He
particularly admired Bacon's rigorous pattern of work from
six to
twelve
in the morning, rather
like that of Graham Greene. Then
anything went. But when Bacon was possessed by a concept, the
work
did
not
stop
for
nights and
days on
end.
This
excess
of
dedication was
always
followed by
a
binge
of play with
Francis
consuming huge quantities of champagne and food with a few old

232
Francis Bacon
friends and sometimes with bevies of young admirers. 'Age was a
curse,' he always
said
to Joule, but he looked and behaved
as
if
preternaturally young. 'He always wanted
to be one of the boys,'
Joule said, and Bacon was generous to those he loved, helping Joule
with advice on how to add to his art collection and on how to paint
the figure. He once gave Joule five-thousand pounds in cash to use
for food and drink for one week when Peter Beard was staying in
London, and he spent eight-hundred pounds on a dinner for the
two of them - the port cost two-hundred pounds
alone.
All the
presents he was sent in the 'seventies, the pictures by other artists
and the inscribed art books, he gave to Joule to keep as his historian
and archivist - a role
later played by John Edwards, the
last long
companion of the artist.
Bacon himself wanted nothing which he could not consume, and
he held onto few possessions. What did concern him more and more
was his reputation. Greatiy interested in the history of photography.
Joule
tried
to
persuade
Bacon
to mount
an
exhibition
of
the
photographs which had most influenced him. Such a demonstration
of the connection between photography and a modern painter would
have been of seminal significance. But Bacon demurred. He wanted
'to be pure about his art and not muddy the waters about his work'.
According to Joule, 'Francis Bacon always saw himself beside Picasso
- he was very aware of the paintings Picasso had discarded in his
eighties. He was very tight about what he let out of the studio in his
old
age. When he could, he bought back and destroyed his
early
works or exchanged them
for
like paintings on
a
similar theme.'
Actually, these earlier paintings had very little value on the market.
'Yet Francis was very aware of his place in history and where he
stood.'
'I'm greedy for
life,' Bacon said to Sylvester, 'and I'm greedy as
an
artist.' He wished
for chance
to give him in painting far more
than he could calculate, he wanted the excitement of things happen-
ing and being with the people he
liked. Yet he did not dice with
death, carefully looking both ways before he bounced cockily across
the road. Only occasionally did he use drink or
pills
to help him
finish a picture. They were not good for him: they dulled his final
judgement. Fatigue could help him if he could lose his will and feel

Fact Leaves
its Ghost
233
free to go anywhere with his creation. Even a bout of despair about
the
impossibility of completing something might
lead him
to do
anything. 'And out of this anything, one sees what happens.'
Stephen Spender found Bacon's feelings of frustration and despair
when painting the same as if he were writing poetry or even reviews
for the Times Literary Supplement. Often mentally and quite convinc-
ingly, he abandoned something which he would pick up again, or he
felt overrun by a rush of ideas that he could not organise. In the case
of Bacon:
Despair occurs when the artist does not work with a pre -prepared
or a preconceived structure, such as a drawing, a model or object
before him, in other words when he has not predecided his ideas
and
efforts.
Everything - ideas and means - the
paint
itself -
surrounds him with its swarm of potentialities threatening to engulf
him. Creativity is a struggle to control this rush of ideas and means.
Despair
is almost a necessary condition in such circumstances.
It
is the measurable point in time and place at which the force he
is
trying to control almost overwhelms him, the point at which victory
and defeat are in balance.
It is either the moment of defeat, or of
breakthrough.
Such a reckless charge at painting and living was a potent example
for young artists who wanted to walk on the wilder side of existence.
The extraordinary AustraHan painter, Brett Whiteley, the youngest
artist ever to be bought by the Tate Gallery, took as his role models
Baudelaire and Van Gogh and Rimbaud and Cocteau, but especially
Bacon,
all of whom he turned into portraits with his energetic and
flowing brush, fuelled by heroin and marijuana and alcohol. Jeffrey
Bernard was also stimulated in his career as the Boswell of low life
in Soho by weekly lunches at Wheeler's with Isabel Rawsthorne and
Bacon. 'We would gossip generally and always
talk about sex and
death,' Bernard wrote. 'He seemed amused by both subjects and he
used
to quiz me about my being heterosexual
as though
I was a
creature from outer space.' He once caused a walk-out of American
tourists from the next table by asserting that he would
like
to be
buggered by
his
favourite
pin-up.
Colonel
Gaddafi. Bacon con-
sidered Bernard 'an honorary poof, while Bernard felt honoured to

234
Francis Bacon
be a friend. They had a shared love of gambling, and Bacon would
stake Bernard to his bets and would anyway stuff a fift\'-pound note
into his jacket pocket if he did not place
it on a horse. *He was never
flashy with his generosity, but he had a healthy contempt for money.
"Bits of paper," he called
it after a good night at the roulette table.'
Although Bacon had
little interest in politics, he did know some
politicians, particularly the remarkable Tom Driberg, who was also
an habitue of the Colony Room and of the company of young men.
On one
occasion, Driberg was with
a Sunday
Times
interviewer,
when they bumped into Bacon
at the
foot of the
stairs of Muriel
Belcher's
bar,
and
there
the
politician
and
the
artist embraced
effusively. While Bacon went up on his spring heels in search of an
afternoon's fun, Driberg had to return to the House of Commons in
his sober dark blue
suit, collar and
tie. The report of the meeting
showed the abyss between Westminster and Fleet Street on one side
and the liberty of the painter on the other:
He [Driberg] would have been as happy as a poet and has always
enjoyed Bohemian
company,
finding many
friends among
the
strange community who have made their spiritual home in Soho.
Instead,
journalism
and
politics imposed
on him
the
need
to
preserve some vestige of respectability and
it is a mande which has
always been uncomfortable round his shoulders.
When we were walking away from the Colony Room late that
sunny afternoon, our brief encounter with Francis Bacon obviously
triggered off a
familiar sequence of thoughts
in Driberg's mind
because he was silent for some time, then, looking around
at the
flickering neon signs of the strip clubs and restaurants and pubs
and delicatessens, he said, quite sofdy, as if to himself: 'You know,
I've always wished in a way that
I could have lived this kind of life.'
Living in many worlds under the camouflage of his
respectability,
Driberg did live at times the kind of life of the artist Bacon, who was
himself a pioneer in the demonstration of his preferences. Although,
with
the Sexual Offences Act of 1967, homosexual
acts between
consenting
adults had ceased
to be
criminal,
while
overt contact
magazines
and
specialist
papers
such
as Gay News
appeared,
a
backlash
of the
moral
majority
led by Lady Birdwood and Mrs

Fact Leaves
its Ghost
235
Whitehouse had begun. The blasphemy of Bacon's various triptychs
of Crucifixions had never been prosecuted, but blessed by the state
and hung in the Tate
Gallery. Yet the publication of a poem by
James Kirkup, a young friend of E. M. Forster and J. R. Ackerley,
under the title of The Love that Dares to Speak its Name', led to a
charge of blasphemy against Gay News, The poem told of a centurion
left alone v^ith Christ's body before burial. He entered orifices and
wounds and revived the corpse for a last time to sodomise himself.
The message was that homosexuality now dared to speak
its name.
It was out of the
closet as Christ was out of the Tomb. Kirkup
admitted
that he knew
his poem would dismay and shock some
people - but had he not himself 'been deeply offended, dismayed
and shocked by their vtrsion of the Crucifixion'. His sentiments were
similar to Bacon's, who knew that his versions of the Crucifixion
with their orifices and bleeding meat would shock some people, and
who saw no religious significance in the Cross, only human violence
and
torture and
sexual
connotations,
as
in
the
left panel of the
Munich
'Crucifixion'
with
its
glancing nude
leaving
a
slavering
bestial creature on the twisted bed.
The difference was that Kirkup's poem was
trite and arch with
puns such as Christ being 'well hung' on the Cross, while Bacon's
'Crucifixions' were born
in personal anguish and
executed by
a
genius. Kirkup's effort was judged in court for
its 'quite appalling
and most scurrilous profanity' with
its
'reckless disregard
for the
feelings of Christians and non-Christian sympathisers'. Fines were
levied
against Gay News and
its
publisher, who
also
received
a
suspended
prison
sentence. The
victory
for
the
moral
majority,
however, did not deter the publication of two important homosexual
memoirs, Christopher Isherwood's Christopher and His Kind, dealing
with many of the same sexual encounters that the young Bacon had
experienced during
his
early
visit
to
Berlin, and Tom Driberg's
Ruling Passions, which brought him out of the closet and the cloacal
cottages with
a vengeance.

236
Francis Bacon
In his undemonstrative way and only through his
art, Bacon had
long since dared to depict, as Oscar Wilde said in his defence, 'the
love that dare not speak
its name in this century'. In declaring that
he was painting his autobiography, in showing frequent pictures
at
international exhibitions of male nudes coupling or tearing
at one
another or performing bodily acts in their bathrooms. Bacon put the
actual names of his masculine lovers on the works, particularly that
of George Dyer. He was not denouncing them as in an American
trial by Senator McCarthy. He was commemorating his passion and
obsession for one man at a time across the world, an act of homage
and defiance that the ten-thousand banners waving for Gay Libera-
tion could never have achieved.
Yet his philosophy prevented Bacon from being interested in any
form of politics. Sexual or economic or social matters were excluded
from
his thoughts,
if they did not personally
affect him. He was
rather on the right wing and certainly against the welfare state that
the Labour Government was promoting in Britain. He thought that
being nursed from the cradle to the grave would bring boredom to
life. He
felt no moral case against theft. He had often stolen as a
young man. He did not need to steal now and would no longer risk
the nuisance of being caught and put in gaol. But he did accept that
most of society was against theft and people now expected welfare
and
the nanny
state. Too much
security,
however,
curtailed
the
creative instinct, which fed on despair about existence. Although all
life was artificial, social justice and egalitarianism made
it poindessly
so. The suffering of people and their differences had made great art.
Who remembers or cares about a happy society.^ After hundreds of
years or so, all they think about is what a society has left.'
This attitude t© individual achievement and the leaving of monu-
ments
to
future
generations made
Bacon
a
prophet
of
British
government in the 'eighties, when the Conservative Part\' would turn
away from the welfare state as far as
it could towards initiative. He
was not really a do-gooder, as he said. He supposed he should want
to improve
life and did not like to think of people suffering; but
it
was their problem. They bred
at such a
rate, they were bound
to
suffer. Bacon did not value the opinion of the masses or the mob.
His pessimism and concentration on the personal had increased with

his years. Born before the First World War, he had seen the failure
of the
socialist experiments in Europe over the past four decades,
and he would pursue his own road as Van Gogh had in Provence.
Alexander
Pope
might
have
declared
that
the
proper
study
of
mankind was man. But for himself, the proper study of Bacon was
Bacon.
During 1974, Bacon worked at pictures for his successive exhi-
bitions at Marlborough Fine Art in Bond Street and for the show of
his recent work
at the Metropolitan Museum in New York.
In a
sense,
it was an autobiography of his last years with Dyer and the
process
of the
cleansing
of
his
bereavement. The
two
earliest
triptychs among the
thirty-five pictures
in the American showing
dated from
1970, 'Three Studies of the Male Back' and 'Studies
from the Human Body'. They showed Dyer in his voluptuous and
gravid use of the bathroom, and then in his violent coupling, with
Bacon as an onlooker with a camera on a tripod or as a watcher of
animal lust in split-screen indecision. The various tributes to Dyer
after
his
death including the
factual
'Triptych, May-June,
1973'
were concluded by another black-backed triple painting of March
the following year. Dyer's body has been transmuted
to grace
in
movement, the blur of an athlete in competition, the Greek sculptor
Myron's
'Discobulus'
contorting
his mighty body
in
a
last heave
under a naked light bulb. This time the viewer on the right has his
face hidden by his hand camera with
its spouting
orifice, while
a
butcher in his apron on the left turns away in his heavy boots from
his pinkish and carnal shadow to shut up shop. The fact of still death
is transformed into the mercy of moving memory, duly recorded, but
the episode closed.
Among the series of self-portraits at the Metropolitan exhibition,
mounted
in Hecht's identical strongly-moulded and heavy-glassed
gold frames with an exact spacing between the panels of the
five
inches
specified by
the
painter, one
revealing
study showed
the
seated Bacon slumped at a washbasin, time ticking on the wrist of
the arm he has thrown over his grieving head. Behind him, his image
sits
in reverse, held
in the open door against blue sky of happier
days.
In
addition
there was
a
'Seated
Figure', which
ringed
the
repeated knees in the shape of pairs of buttocks with a black circle.

238
Francis Bacon
A dark noose was also thrown around the private parts of a 'Sleeping
Figure', asprawl on a camp-bed.
Two other major works of 1975, 'Studies from the Human Body'
and 'Three Figures and a Portrait', took Bacon back to Muybridge.
Although the
distorted small
portrait
is
still of George Dyer, the
convoluted
and
twisted
creatures,
spiny and
creased,
recall
the
deformed subjects of some of the Victorian photographer's work, as
do the sprawling hermaphrodites of the body studies. An uncharac-
teristic 'Portrait of a Dwarf, done
in that same year, showed him
bifurcated in his perch on his high stool and trapped in a corrugated
corner. It further signalled a return to the photographs of the people
once called freaks in the previous century.
The later works in the last of the three galleries devoted to Bacon
in the Metropolitan Museum were
realised with
a palette almost
reduced
to black and white and red and yellow.
It was the
four-
colour system of the Greek painter Apelles and his classical contem-
poraries, as Pliny had noted. The effect was one of dramatic gravity',
compared with the bright decorator-colours of the backgrounds of
the earlier pieces in the other two
galleries. Both the influence of
Greek sculpture and Renaissance art was evident in the works of the
previous three years, Diirer's 'Melancholia' in the central panel of
'Triptych, May-June 1973' as well as Myron's discus-thrower, that
quintessence of human motion.
Bacon had recently been talking to David Sylvester about taking
up
sculpture,
putting
his
figures on
rails
or armatures
as
in
his
paintings. These interviews with Bacon were published in New York
to coincide with his exhibition there. He had expressed a heightened
admiration
for antique and Renaissance sculpture and
art, saying
that they constituted
for him the greatest images men had made.
These feelings, in the words of the critic of the Burlington Magazine,
'underlie the kind of classical clarification and sculptural-like force
of concept evident
in the
late
paintings', which had
'elevated the
basic, later-twentieth-century substance of Bacon's art, without at all
sacrificing its personal, elemental force, to a more universal level of
expression'.
Bacon's critical triumph in New York put the laurel wreath on his
international reputation. He seemed to have won his Olympic games

239
with
chance. He was
adept now
at one -line
remarks
for mass
pubHcity, talking of a
life divided between 'the gutter and the Ritz'
and of surviving on 'a diet of oysters and despair'. The prices of his
work were climbing and exploding like feux d'artifice. A Sotheby's
sale of a painting realised more than £70,000 in Rome in 1973; two
years later in London, Sotheby's received £65,000 for a screaming
pope.
Already, he was
highly prized and
priced throughout
the
world. But his success could not wholly
fill the void in his
life in
pursuit of extreme
sensation, which had been checked by Dyer's
death. Although he declared that he would give up painting
self-
portraits, he went on with these exercises in self-analysis, picking at
the scabs forming on his
grief. And more and more, he restricted
himself to
the company of old
friends,
looking
for
a
stability
in
affection that he had never had.
In search of some sort of permanence. Bacon bought a terraced
house in the country, at Wivenhoe, near Colchester in Essex. Dennis
Wirth-Miller lived in the village with his friend Richard Chopping
at the Store House on the Quay. They had given the fete champetre
there
after
Michael
Wishart's
three-day
wedding
reception
in
Bacon's former studio. The writer and illustrator Chopping taught
at the Royal College of Art. Wirth-Miller was something of a painter
until Bacon told him that he did not have the right to touch a canvas
and discouraged him completely. The two men
at Wivenhoe had
the stable relationship that Bacon was again seeking, even though
Chopping was famous for his performances at the Royal College's
pantomimes, particularly as the Good Fairy, which prompted Bacon
to say, 'Well, that's the best Cinderella I have ever seen.' Chopping's
performance in drag as Marlene Dietrich was also a tour-de-force,
particularly his Tailing in Love Again' from The Blue Angel.
'Men cluster to me
Like moths around a flame
.
.
.'
At Wivenhoe,
Bacon was
immensely popular
in
the
local pubs
because of his lavish hospitality and unbuttoned conversation. What
surprised another neighbour,
the newspaper editor
Sir Peregrine
Worsthorne, was Bacon's 'interest in, and knowledge of, history and

240
Francis Bacon
politics; also his reactionary views ... he was an ardent supporter of
the Vietnam War. Equally surprising was the toleration demonstrated
by the Wivenhoe residents
to Francis's endless chasing of all
the
pretty boys. The
village view was
that he was harmless,
in
spite
of his
devilish
pictures.' Bacon appreciated
not only
his
tolerant
neighbours, but also the flat countryside and the Essex marshes. He
had spoken to John Russell about how sensitive he was to every kind
of enclosed indoor space as well as to level ground:
*rd rather have a carpeted aircraft hangar, any day, than an ugly
house. The huge space with a bathroom and lavatory in one comer
could look very grand. Even the pipes could look so beautiful.
I'd
like
it
to be
in
flat,
treeless
country
.
.
.
Essex
or Norfolk
.
.
.
because very intimate country, "rolling country",
is not for me.
I
was brought up for much of my childhood on the edge of very flat
marshlands
full of snipe and plover. That's the kind of country
I
find exciting.'
These
flat expanses of favourite countryside were the spaces
that
Bacon tried to reproduce in his paintings,
a blank immensity- in a
little room. A rare 'Landscape' of 1978 showed a sandy beach with
rough-brushed grass in the shape of a plunging human creature with
two red arrows pointing to the whirl of earth and sky, yet all enclosed
with the night in a transparent box. Even nature to Bacon was in a
trap. And he felt that he was, too. His autobiography of the 'seventies
placed himself with his single figures on the level of an infinite plain
within
a
definite
enclosure.
If the viewer were
to
enter such
a
painting, he would meet the painter inside his captured distances.
The studies for his self-portraits now showed a reflective face or
one with a wine ghss flying to its lips. His 'Two Studies for Portrait
of Richard Chopping' continued his making of his private life into a
public
art. They are
full of insight and
sensibility, the eyes of the
subject caught in a glance of concern in full face, while a side view
demonstrates the same interest in a turn of the head, exposing a fine
cheek-bone and jawline. These were loving pictures, as were those
of Michel Leiris, the counterpart of Chopping in Paris.
Such portraits of understanding friends marked Bacon's refuge
from
his
passion
for
the
semi-criminal
Dyer
into
a
haven
of

241
sympathetic intellectuals, who understood the tension and sensation
of his character and style of life, the ferocity of the commitment, the
desperate pursuit of chance, the seizing of form and figure out of
chaos, the wilful excitement of ducking and delving into the base
and the best, the despair of the true artist in the chase after a love
that might destroy his art. Bacon transcended his obsession with the
ghost of Dyer, but he did not recover from
it in the society of like
minds. He had had an anarchic
nostalgie de la boue ever since his
adventures with the stable lads in his father's racing establishment.
He would look again for that satisfaction and not feel the sensation
of exhilarated despair until he found the fact of it.


II
So Many Eyes, So Many Ears
The poets made Fame a monster. They describe her in part
finely and elegantiy; and in part gravely and sententiously.
They say, look how many feathers she hath, so many eyes
she hath underneath; so many tongues; so many voices; she
pricks up so many ears.
'Of Fame'
by Francis Bacon, Lord Verulam,
Viscount St. Albans
The self-portraits by Bacon in the late 'seventies show the painter
coming to terms with his
grief. In one of 1978, muted greens and
blues give a rural feel to the
artist sitting on his stool with folded
hands and calm face in profile. There is no distortion of the features,
only a luminous shadow behind the side of the face to emphasise the
contemplation of the figure. Although entrapped in a hoop of white,
Bacon shows himself mentally at ease. And the 'Three Studies for
Self-Portraits' of the succeeding year, chosen by Bacon himself to
illustrate Michel
Leiris's book about him,
accentuate
the
artist's
round cheeks and blond
forelock. His eyes and mouth no longer
mourn, but inquire and open into the sensation of living. Almost for
the
last time, George Dyer appears
in 'Seated Figure,
1978', but
only as a handsome profile on a plinth, excluded from the transparent
cage,
in which the mysterious figure in cricket pads
sits under an
umbrella. A black arrow points
the way
to
a red
ring round
his
obscure
sexual
organs. Another lover
is removing Dyer onto
the
pedestal of the past.
Bacon always
related what he
felt about death
to what he
felt

244
Francis Bacon
about
life and about gambling. He had strong feelings about them
all, and dying to him was only another turn of the coin. His attraction
to casinos was reflected in his pictures, as death was. There was the
excitement of people winning or not winning,
the
despair of the
players losing everything. And
all went on
in
a very concentrated
place, the confine in which he
set the figures in his paintings. He
played roulette because the odds were most against him, but if he hit
the
right numbers,
the rewards were quicker and
greater.
It was
instant gratification. But in the end, not even he could beat the odds.
He was
the
perfect compost
for
casinos, because he was
nearly
always losing. At Aspinall's in Curzon Street, on one occasion he
was allowed to run up a
bill and pay by cheque. Everything went
wrong and he found himself owing nearly forty-thousand pounds.
Even with the money he was earning from his growing fame,
it took
him months and months to repay. On another occasion at Crock-
ford's, he entered with £6,000 in banknotes carefully divided into
two jacket pockets. This was his form of caution. To have to dig into
a second pocket should be an obstacle to losing it all.
It was not.
Yet gambling to Bacon was hardly a real risk, such as risking one's
life. Nor was painting a real
risk, more
like an accident within his
power to alter. In gambling, once the wheel was spinning, there was
nothing he could do about
it. With a brush in one hand, he diced
with chance, he was
still
in the game. And he played
it with
full
commitment in deadly earnest. His concern over the survival of his
best work lay not only in his efforts to destroy or deny his earlier or
inferior works, but also
in trying to stop
a lucrative trade
in fake
Bacons that was started in Milan in Italy.
The problem was that Bacon rarely signed his paintings, and the
fakes bore no forged signatures, so that their
artists could not be
prosecuted
for
fraud. What the
false
pictures had
attached were
doctored provenances or attributions by small dealers. Two
Italian
forgeries of portraits of Isabel Rawsthorne w ere authenticated by a
Chelsea bookseller and a London art dealer. The bookseller admit-
ted that the portraits came to him from the 'gay network of dealers',
and he should have put in his Letter of Provenance,
'in the Francis
Bacon style [although]
it was a strong Bacon and did speak so well'.
The
art dealer explained
his Letter of Provenance by stating that

So Many Eyes, So Many Ears
245
when he wrote that he had acquired the *Rawsthorne' portrait,
it did
not mean he had bought
it. In the trade, 'acquired' did not imply
ownership, as
it might to ordinary people. He had not bought
it for
himself, so he was not responsible for verifying a forgery.
There was also the problem of Bacon's abandoned paintings. He
had
left one incomplete canvas in a coal-cellar which was sold in
Sotheby's for £71,000. 'Before the sale', he said, 'Sotheby's, on my
behalf, made
it clear that it was discarded, but it sold.
I can't tell you
why people are
fools.' He had
to cut up
all the paintings he had
discarded in order to prevent them reaching the art market, but he
forgot about some of them when he moved and others had been
stolen from him. He did, however, take steps to deny the forgeries
from
Italy.
'I have even signed the backs of photographs of fakes,
"This
is a fake and not by me." But forgers have then cut out the
genuine signature to accompany one of their latest fakes.'
The Milan
forgers, however, were making one
basic
mistake.
They were painting on the front of the canvas, while Bacon painted
on the umprimed back. But as his fame and his prices soared, the
forgeries multiplied. There were many abandoned canvases knocking
around from his various old studios, and as he loathed the unsigned
early works and incomplete versions. Bacon was not past denying his
hand in anything he disliked, even
if he had done
it. The London
art dealer who had sold on the 'Rawsthorne' fake had to admit finally
that 'if the living authority, the artist himself, challenges a work, he
must have the final word'. Indeed, and Bacon only authenticated the
works of which he now approved, and he tried to cut up the rest.
He was in no way a doctor of his past, but he wished to preserve
solely what he considered the best of his paintings for posterity. The
worth of anything done by him was so valuable that he himself had
become vulnerable to exploitation. However much he tried to restrict
his
circle
to
old
friends,
his penchant
for younger men
led
to
approaches by those looking for a killing from his fabled generosity
or from burglary.
It was the
price of his fame. He was perfecdy
aware of the danger, but naturally gregarious when he went to the
Colony Room or other favourite haunts. And he was a canny man
about his pictures, fearful that they would get into the wrong hands.
Even when he was arguing about the aspect of something, and
a

246
Francis Bacon
close
friend asked him
to sketch
it on the
tablecloth, he was no
Toulouse-Lautrec or Picasso to do
it and enrich the friend or the
waiter with the scrawl he left behind him.
The film director Derek Jarman often told a story which Bacon
had told him about one morning when his caution about the company
he kept backfired badly. He
felt in the money and indulged himself
with a rent-boy for the night in the era before AIDS was a known
plague. He hid his gold Swiss watch under the bedside rug so that
the rent-boy did not take
it with him as he departed. But rising to
go,
the rent-boy put the
heel of his boot on
the watchface and
shattered
it below the rug, totally destroying
it. The best-laid plans
of vice and men ganga a-gley.
Bacon's nocturnal adventures could even affect his pictures, given
his
love of the chance element
in painting. As he
told Kenneth
Partridge,
if a passing bedfellow did not know where
to go and
looked for a window to reHeve himself and the golden shower fell on
a wet painting, so
it stayed, if Bacon liked the effect of the incident
on his work in the morning.
It was the same
if a visitor brushed
against a wet canvas and smudged
it.
It was also the same if rain fell
through the old roof or the skylight of Reece Mews and spattered
the drying oils on a painting, or if Bacon had to move his bed out of
the deluge and
the end of the
sheets smeared
his
art. He once
outlined the round rim of his dust-bin lid with black paint to paint a
ring round the genitals in one picture. Any of these actions might
provide that happy accident which made the picture: that moment of
fact where luck met design.
As Farson wrote of Bacon, most of the young men he encountered
in the Soho bar^ became
his
friends, not his boyfriends. And he
could pass them on to other friends, as he did to Joan Wyndham's
lodger, called Sal in the third volume of her autobiography. She had
finished an
affair with Lucian Freud and had introduced
Sal
to
Bacon in the French Pub and through him to a successful West End
art dealer who became his lover. Sal was later to commit suicide, but
his diary reflected the
feelings of so many of the young men who
clustered around Bacon, now in his sixties, and his circle and became
close to them. To Sal, the art dealer was 'hot, a pure boy's peril, the

So Many Eyes, So Many Ears
247
ultimate corrupter of young acolytes'. He did not know why he found
himself in bed with the older man.
What am
I doing in this homosexual mayhem, stretched out like a
beast in four-posted splendour
lit by the maverick flame of our
penultimate candle?
What am I doing with this man of forty-five? When he drinks his
cheeks flush and the wine dribbles from the corner of his mouth.
When
I sleep with him
I emerge parched, barren and dizzy from
his clutches. This is not love, not truth, just rotting physicality.
I try to pretend
I am doing
it for experience and edification -
I
offer you my sweetness, you offer me your culture. But I suppose
I
am
just what they
call an Art Tart. Afterwards
I
cry and wash
manically, trying to expiate, to purify myself
A great friend of Bacon and part of the circle of his framer Alfred
Hecht was Geoffrey Bennison, probably the best interior decorator
in Britain. He had darting eyes, which dissected the onlooker and
often undid him. He lived in Golden Square with three male acolytes
to serve him, Babs and Carlotta and Scotch Agnes. They had been
frequent visitors to Tangier, where they would stay at the Riff Hotel.
They had met Bacon
in
his
days
there
with
Peter
Lacey,
and
Bennison put up William Burroughs in his guest house in Kensing-
ton. They were particularly adept at picking up for the price of a
packet of cigarettes the young male offenders after they were released
from Brixton prison. Bacon found Bennison's group a little outre for
his plainer tastes, particularly at a drag ball given with young actors
hired to be waiters in ruffles and wigs and knee-britches. Tar too
camp,' he said and left.
Yet he had
a
level of sophistication which
surprised even
the
urbane Alfred Hecht. When Bacon invited him to Claridge's or the
Connaught for lunch, Hecht was starded to hear the maitre d'hotel
say, 'Mr Bacon, your usual table
in the corner there?' Hecht had
some very good early Bacon paintings, a triptych of George Dyer, a
distorted Tink-faced Baby', and
a 'Man with
a Watch', who was
bending down with
a
measuring-tape,
said
to commemorate
the
coming of the Metric System to Britain. All of these pictures had to
be sold to private collectors in the last years of Hecht's life to pay for

248
Francis Bacon
his medical
bills. Hecht finally induced Bacon not to paint on any
old size of canvas because of the high insurance costs, while he was
framing them. In that way, he uniquely cut Bacon's pictures down to
size. Both men also ruined their art books and sliced them apart to
see and read them the better. And like Bacon, Hecht liked to give,
never to receive; to have the power of the host, not the obligation of
the guest.
During these indeterminate years without a single special attach-
ment, Bacon spent more and more time in the Colony Room. But
Muriel Belcher was
ill and dying. Bacon paid for her and her friend
to go to recuperate in the West Indies but she did not really recover.
He painted her again as a Sphinx in 1979, which was to prove the
year of her
death.
In
it,
the
almost bald Belcher with
a beaked
nose
sits with a black open tunic over her shoulders exposing her
breasts, while her clawed thin shanks are thrust forward on two large
wooden joists or splints. Slabs of purple and orange surround her,
and a simple black trapezoid turns these into spaces. A jumble of
newsprint
lies on the
floor, perhaps
to suggest the jargon of any
obituary.
When Belcher died. Bacon had lost another dear friend. But he
went on visiting the Colony Room, now run by the ex-barman, Ian
Board, who imitated Muriel in her style and foul language, though
not
in her sex or warmth. The drinking laws were
still
in place,
and there was nowhere more convenient to go in Soho during the
afternoons when the pubs were closed. ^These ghastly English laws,
you can't have a drink, can't do anything,' Bacon complained to one
interviewer. 'Do you think they'll ever change them.^
I don't think so
- the Church will stop them, you can be certain.
I can take you up
to that awful Colony Room if you like.'
He went on taking people up to that afternoon drinking club.
It
suited his hours and his style of life. He even liked seeing strangers
there, watching the formation of their faces and their movements,
and he would introduce himself to any young man who caught his
fancy, as he had to the artist Michael Clarke on his first visit there -
Clarke also painted a death-bed portrait of Muriel Belcher. Bacon
found that people were very free in the club.
It was
like a pool
in
which they forgot their inhibitions, most lively and amusing. And
it

So Many Eyes, So Many Ears
249
gave him the
material
for
his
portraits. As he now
said,
'All the
people that Fve painted Fve either met in pubs or have known very
well.'
Except when he took a brat pack of tough young acolytes to one of
his exhibitions at Marlborough Fine Art, Bacon kept his private life
extremely discreet outside the places in Soho, where he knew that
his reputation was protected. Because of this sense of privacy and
discretion. Bacon was invited to become a Companion of Honour in
1977, although he had previously declined a knighthood. Previous
recipients had included Henry Moore and Graham Sutherland and
Graham Greene and would include Lucian Freud, who was to
fall
out with Bacon over his acceptance of the award. Bacon firmly stuck
to his principles of detachment from established society and refused
this
second
accolade
from
his
country.
'I
always
decline
these
honours,' he
said.
'I never want them.
I have no opinions on the
honours system. It might be fine for other people but I want to stress
I don't want anything for myself.'
Bacon's apparent disdain for convention and morality turned some
of the art critics against him. They saw a contempt in his works for
his viewers and for society. At his triumph in Paris, a critic who had
once thought Bacon a hero for the vital tension in his painting had
lambasted
his fondness
for Grand Guignol symboUsm and
glory.
Richard Cork thought that Bacon's bitter-sweet amalgam of tender-
ness and brutality, sliding from an area of sensuous splendour into a
mass of brutalised slashes, had degenerated into boorish caricature,
outright sensationalism and a bullying despair at the 'inability to turn
unruly ambition into the discipline of great art'. Bacon protested too
loudly in his determination to pitch the tenor of his statements as
high as he possibly could. 'The result is a fatal recoiling on the part
of the spectator, who feels he is expected to be stirred and so withholds
a wholehearted
reaction.' And
at an
exhibition of Bacon's recent
paintings at Marlborough Fine Art in January, 1978, Edward Lucie-
Smith
had
to
admit
that Bacon
was
the
most
celebrated
and
prestigious of British painters, but disliked his restricted imaginative
world and obsessive themes of horror, anxiety and fear. The linkage
of the grandeur of the past, as in his pictures derived from Velazquez
and Ingres, with the muck of the present, was unacceptable. The

250
Francis Bacon
grand manner should not be put at the service of deliberate squalor.
'What emerges from Bacon's
late paintings
is
a contempt
for the
audience which
is also, perhaps, the painter's contempt for himself.
Can
art as great as Bacon's
is supposed
to be, base
itself upon a
sneer.'^'
Such misunderstandings, by some
critics, of the intentions and
the commitment of Bacon's works were based on a confusion of the
artist's way of life with his work. He had declared that he was trying
to paint the history of the past thirty years; he now insisted that he
was painting an autobiography without any message. Yet many people
in his audience disliked the style of living and were shocked at his
portrayal of it. The paradox was that, as his art became acclaimed
internationally - he had exhibitions in Mexico City and Caracas and
Madrid and Barcelona at this time -
it seemed to lose
its universal
concept for a personal statement.
Bacon did not appear to care what his critics thought outside the
few mentors
that he valued. Michel Leiris had already described
how
Bacon's
private
depictions
of
his
small
world
had
public
significance
and
another French
critic,
Gilles DeLeuze, was
to
complete
the
definition
of Bacon's work
in
a
general
logic
of
sensation, an emotive scale of colours, and a theme in the history of
painting. Such rational analyses from France would resolve in words
the painter's daily battle in his studio between chance and
intent,
luck and
design, and
they
certainly would
absolve him from
the
accusation that he deliberately pursued squalor rather than the truth
and the fact of things.
Bacon used to say that he liked his paintings being called ugly.
Van Gogh had said of The Night Cafe' that it was one of the ugliest
paintings he had''ever done. But Bacon found
it extremely beautiful.
Of course the people in the cafe were ruining themselves by drinking,
but why should they not.^ By swirling the light round the bulbs. Van
Gogh had given his painting an extraordinary intensity, something
which Bacon strove to achieve. This intensity might be called ugly,
but those who thought
it was condemned their own vision. Bacon
was much more pleased when some people really hated his paintings
than when they liked them. There might, after
all, in that case, be
something there.

So Many Eyes, So Many Ears
251
What he
disliked was American
abstract
art. He thought
that
Jackson
Pollock's pictures appeared
to be
bits of old
lace, while
Mark Rothko's looked like yards of dirty maroon cloth rolled out for
the eye. The room given to Rothko in the Museum of Modern Art
in New York had depressed him for a whole day after he had seen
it. They were the dreariest paintings ever made. He had thought that
there might be lovely vibrant colours in abstract art, but actually the
back of his
studio door and
the
walls
in Reece Mews were
his
abstract paintings, because he used them to test out his colours and
they were much brighter than Rothko's were.
'Any painting
that works today
is
linked
to
the
past,' he once
explained.
'In
a way
it was
better when
there
wasn't
so much
individuality. But because today there
is no tradition and no myths,
people are thrown back on their own
sensibility. Abstract art was
perhaps one attempt at getting away from this, but
it never worked
because the artists made their own patterns in their own ways. That
is why American
art
is, on the whole, boring. They want to
start
from nothing.
I understand their position: they are trying to create a
new culture and identity. But why try to be so limited.^'
Even though Bacon loved to work in chaos, his metier was to put
an order on the disorder in his work. He had tried occasionally to
clean up Reece Mews, but
it was
impossible
for him.
'I
live
in
squalor,' he chose to explain. The woman who cleans is not allowed
to touch the
studio. Besides
I
use the dust -
I
set
it
like
pastel.'
Chaos bred the images and textures he sought, although inspiration
only came from regular work, and he painted nearly all the time. He
did try to have a beautifully tidy studio in Roland Gardens nearby,
but
it was a disaster. Although
it had the most perfect light and he
fitted
it with curtains and carpets, he made
it too grand. He
felt
'absolutely castrated in the place', and he had to give
it away to a
friend and only make occasional visits there. There was no hope of
ever painting in such eunuch splendour.
His paintings at the end of the 'seventies were heralded by a rare
triptych,
painted
over
four
years
between
1974
and
1977,
not
executed in his usual frenzy. Two large heads, similar to those on
either side of his Promethean painting of the same period, bracket a
naked kneeling figure, turning away in a pool of purple shadow. A

great arc of beach seems to reach across
all three panels while on
the right and left, two men are raised on wooden ironing-boards and
entwine themselves around dark umbrellas rather than sunbathe on
deck chairs. Two distant riders on the strand, inspired by Degas,
were added as an afterthought. The whole composition appears as
the
artist's memory of holidays
in the South of France, and
as
a
tribute to Degas and Picasso in his sequence of Dinard bathers.
That homage was continued in Tainting, 1978', in which a naked
figure again uses
a
foot
to turn
a key
in the
latch, although the
contorted shape with a seeming weight on
its shoulder also derives
as much from Muybridge's studies
as from those
at Dinard. The
straining toes appear to unlock the door to a stairway,
for two red
arrows point to the head and shoulders of a man descending and to
a discarded and illegible newspaper, announcing something he has
left behind
him.
'Study
for
Portrait' and
'Seated
Figure'
of the
previous year repeat the message that there
is no message. Beneath
pale male shapes slouched with legs akimbo in high chairs, discarded
paperbacks
and
newsprint
float
ignored
in puddles
of shadows.
Tigure Writing Reflected in a Mirror' of 1976 had already shown
the mirror image turning its back on the blobs of letters that the man
seated at the desk was scrawling, while 'Figure in Movement' of that
same year had expressed a rare disgust at homosexual love, a cow's
head staring at a tlirashing lonely figure caught in an orange circle
within
a
cage,
his buttocks
duplicated and
ringed
in
a hopeless
passion for no one there.
Three years
later, however, 'Triptych - Studies of the Human
Body' showed that Bacon was very much back
in the business of
love. On
either
side
of the
violent coupling of two men
in
the
centre,
two
masculine
figures
in
underpants
recline
on
raised
boards. They are descended from the nude sculptures of Day and
Evening that face each other on the tombs of Giuliano and Lorenzo
de' Medici in the Florentine family chapel created by Michelangelo,
whose
male
drawings were
the
greatest
things
in
existence
for
Bacon. This is not grandeur borrowed to show squalor, it is a passion
for the body enclosing the daemon of the sexual urge. A bloody gash
opens
a wound
in the
figure representing Day, while Evening
is
encircled as
if trapped
in hoops. The
ferocity of the love-play
in

So Many Eyes, So Many Ears
253
the centre
is also ringed and smeared, and the teeth of the lower
figure are bared in a howl of sensation. Discarded pages of books
and papers again
trail out of the picture, meaningless even in the
Letraset print that Bacon sometimes used. The whole effect against
the bright orange background
is one of sensual pleasure and pain,
regarded with Olympian detachment by time and an ideal of human
beauty.
Passion for one man and for the act of love had revived in Bacon
at the age of seventy. When he was asked why there were so many
violent couplings of two men in his paintings, he replied that he was
not really a conversational artist. There was very little conversation
in sex,
it cut out the words - rather as he represented the leftover
newspaper and pages beneath the beds of his lovers. Most couplings
were fairly violent. Ejaculation was violent. He painted what he
felt
about homosexual love, but he did not know how violent it looked to
other people.
If
it looked
like
the
act of animals, humans were
animals, part of animal
life. That
is what he saw and sensed and
showed.
*I just like men,' he once said.
'I like their brain.
I like the
quality of their flesh.'
His new and
last protracted
love was John Edwards,
a young
man from the East End, who replaced the fading image of George
Dyer.
As
charming,
but
far more
intelligent
in
the wisdom
of
the
streets, Edwards was
to become
a dominant influence
in the
last
decade
of Bacon's
life,
along
with
his
brothers
and
their
friends. His
father was
a docker who
lived
in Cable
Street, and
Bacon found him working in a pub
at the end of his Limehouse
period. Rather
dyslexic, Edwards was
still made
into the minder
and
photographer
of Bacon's
life
and
the
main
keeper
of the
treasures and gifts that the artist liked to shower on his friends. He
satisfied
Bacon's
perennial
instinct, which
created
the
necessary
tension in his
life and his
art - the raffish set against the genteel,
the dealer opposed to the owner, the beginner versus the established,
the outsider enraged at the system, the boy on the make depending
on the generosity of the older man. As with Dyer, Bacon entered in
his lengthy relationship with Edwards into the Pinteresque world of
the
play,
The
Homecoming,
where
a
refined
menace
pervades
throughout.

254
Francis Bacon
It was significant that in his paintings which he chose for Leiris's
book on him, Bacon put in the 'Three Studies for a Portrait ofJohn
Edwards' of 1980 and 1984 soon after his carnal 'Triptych - Studies
of the Human Body' and some self-portraits. With his crossed and
lifted
leg seated on
a
stool,
his dark
quiff of hair,
his sweeping
jawline and his heavily handsome face, Edwards bore a remarkable
resemblance to his predecessor in Bacon's affections. Yet there was
a strength of portrayal of Edwards that was rarely given to the shilly-
shally of the Dyer portraits, a certain brooding stillness that bespoke
a touch of respect and even fear in the painter.
The fleshiness of Bacon's idiom began to resurrect in his brush,
and the fierceness, and the sense of rushing movement. 'Carcase of
Meat and Bird of Prey' of 1980 revives the theme of the butcher's
shop and the crucifixion of human meat suspended from
a hook,
while the divine vulture
is equally forced by its cage to peck out the
entrails. Another 'Triptych Inspired by the Oresteia of Aeschylus' of
the following year recalled on the
left panel the Eumenides at the
base of the Cross in the early painting in the Tate Gallery. On it was
a bat-like hanging beast with a gaping wound watching a
trail of
blood running beneath a door;
in the
centre, vertebrae and
skull
were bent back from a body into the gore of a bowl held above the
buttocks below; on the
right, a headless desirable male body with
flesh-toned shadow was walking out into the void through a door.
The whole triptych represented the furies and frenzies of the flesh.
Bacon was depicting the private demons of his present passion. 'We
are always hounding ourselves,' he told Hugh Davies in 1983. *We
have been made aware of this side of ourselves by Freud.' He had
reverted to Greek myth to explain his human obsession.
The
love of John Edwards threw up
in Bacon's
art even more
violence and voluptuousness. He appeared
twenty years younger
than he was, although when this was pointed out to him, he used to
reply,
'That means
I am
still
old' He
painted
uncharacteristic
pictures of rushing motion in nature,
a
'Jet of Water' and 'Water
from a Running Tap', in one case throwing a bowl of grey wash over
the
picture
to
achieve
the
effect
in
his
personal form
of action
painting. He seemed full of a terrible energy, a consuming sensation
for living as well
as
for working. His pattern of reaction between

So Many Eyes, So Many Ears
255
hazard and order, painting and playing, circumstance and control,
was eased by his concentrated affection. And this necessary tension
within the artist was to be reduced to a philosophy that would satisfy
him for the rest of his life.


12
To Define the Undefinable
He commanded where he spoke, and had his judges angry
and pleased at his devotion. No man had their affections
more in his power. The fear of every man that heard him was
lest he should make an end.
Ben Jonson on Francis Bacon,
Lord Verulam, Viscount St. Albans
As he
aged, Francis Bacon became more
like
his great Jacobean
ancestor and namesake, the philosopher and essayist. Cogently and
clearly, he could tell his critics exactly what he was trying to do. He
related his work and his Hfe to his thought as well as his fortune. As
the playwright Ben Jonson wrote of the original Francis Bacon, 'The
fear of every man that heard him was lest he should make an end.'
His descendant also achieved a command of language and of paint.
In that definition of what he did, in *the matter of fact' that he now
called his pictures, he had been helped by the inquiring and sceptical
interviews of English
art
critics,
particularly David
Sylvester and
John Russell and Hugh Davies. But his
articulate presentation of
himself was refined by the rationalism and analysis of the culture he
most admired. Michel Leiris, and now Gilles DeLeuze, gave him a
French conceptual framework for his every intention, however far
his reliance on luck and the unconscious affected his actual execution
of a work of art.
Leiris had a personal sympathy for Bacon, while DeLeuze applied
to the oeuvre of the painter only the
full rigour of his methodology.
His introduction to his book, published in Paris in 1985, stated that

258
Francis Bacon
Bacon's
pictures would be considered
in an order
that
led
to
a
general
logic of sensation. The conclusion of this
logical process
would be a theory of sensation through colours. Each aspect could
also
serve
as
a theme
in
a
particular sequence
in
the
history of
painting. Starting with the circle and the track, DeLeuze referred to
the
circles and cubes and bars of rails and
arches of sofas
that
enclosed each of Bacon's figures in isolation, to avoid narration or
illustration. Yet there was a rapport between the figures in a triptych,
what the
artist called 'matters of fact'. Yet what
facts surrounded
each lonely
shape.'^ The answer was
lively, uniform, and immobile
blocks of colour with the function of creating structure and space.
The very shadows were thin and hard and seized the Figure. As
Bacon himself said, he tried even to make the shadows as present as
the
figures
themselves. The
three
elements
in
his
painting,
the
material structure and the
circular contour and the set-up of the
image were countered by the flow of the brush. As Andre Bazin had
written of the
art and movement of Jacques Tati,
it consisted
'of
destroying the precise by the precise'.
Modern painting had to seize the Figure from the figurative. For
Bacon, even his hero Velazquez had been too close to figurative art
because he had not had the benefit of photographs, and because
painting was
still linked somewhat to religious feeling. Now painting
was an atheistic game. In a world clogged with instant images, the
modern artist approaching the white canvas found
it already full of
cliches of the past
that had
to be
erased. But the games which
the
artist had to play were not spectator sports. The voyeurs and
photographers and passers-by in Bacon's triptychs were witnesses,
as were the painted photographs on the walls or heads set on plinths.
In that function, ^these silent witnesses were like those in Kafka and
Beckett. To eliminate any sense of the spectator, the Figure adopted
'a
singular
athleticism' and was
often
enclosed
in
a
cylinder
to
exclude any viewer. The Figure was the source of intense movement,
to escape both from the trap of the background and from the flesh
itself. That motion was
a spasm as
in 'Figure
at a Washbasin' of
1976, when the male nude was stuck to the taps, abject, trying to
escape through the plughole, pouring out newsprint. These spasms
represented
ejaculation and vomiting and
shitting and screaming.

To Define the Undefinable
259
The body was trying to escape through
its organs, the mouth and
other orifices.
As a portraitist, Bacon painted heads, not faces. The head was a
dependency of the body, which represented the animal in man, a pig
or dog or beast. Bacon unmade the face and sprang the head from
the features, using the indeterminate zone between the human and
the animal. He was more interested in the meat and the flesh of the
body than the bones, which only served as a spatial structure. Meat
for Bacon represented his pity for the long butchery between the
English and the
Irish as
it represented for Soutine the sorrows of
Jewish history. The animal carcasses were the colour of vulnerable
living
flesh
and
were
imbued
with
suffering. The
painter was
certainly the butcher and his shop was the church, as the hanging
meat was the body of Christ. Only in the butcher's shop was Bacon
a religious painter. Generally, in treating the head as the body, he
removed
the
skull
and made
the
features
rather
boneless. He
particularly admired
the
quality of Rembrandt's
last
self-portrait,
now exhibited at Aix-en-Provence, which showed only the decaying
flesh with black holes for eyes. In this bloody view of humanity, the
body could but escape from the screaming mouth as from an artery.
The ways to avoid narrative or illustrative painting were by the
abstract or by sensation,
as Cezanne
did. The Hegelian idea of
sensing and
feeling was translated by Cezanne into how to paint,
how
to
use
spontaneity and
temperament and
instinct and
the
nervous system and the vital moment to create a picture. He taught
the Impressionists that sensation did not lie in the play of light and
colour, but in the feeling for the form of an apple. Sensation was
what was painted, not what was represented.
It was what was lived
while the sensation was experienced. Painting that sensation linked
Cezanne to Bacon, and sensation was also the mistress of distortion.
Every series of triptych by Bacon showed variants of sensation, which
occasionally accumulated or coagulated.
And
yet Bacon
eliminated
the
sensational. He had
finally
to
renounce in his pictures the violence of Ireland and Nazism and the
Crucifixion. In fact, the greatest violence in his works was when the
figure was
seated
or squatting alone,
suffering no
torture
except
from the power of the paint. This was pictorial violence in its proper

26o
Francis Bacon
sense; as Bacon himself said, there was nothing to be seen
in the
violence of painting which had anything to do with the violence of
war. He sought the sensation that would best occupy the flesh. He
found
it in the sensation of movement, from figures seized
at odd
moments on strange journeys, as in his Van Gogh series. He tried
to achieve
a
unity of
all
the
senses,
as
in
his
portraits of Isabel
Rawsthorne. Above all, he tried to capture a vital rhythm in his visual
sensation,
as Cezanne had. But he sought that
reality by
artifice,
while Cezanne had sought it in nature.
Like Artaud, Bacon also looked for intense bodies without organs,
transported from the flesh by nerves and feelings. Like Burroughs,
he saw the organs
as indeterminate and
transferable. The mouth
could become an anus or a wound. Like Gauguin with his 'insatiable
eye'. Bacon wanted to discover the material reality^ of the body with
a system of lines and
colours. To do
that, he had
to operate on
Klee's formula, 'not to render the visible, but to make visible'. He
had
to show
the
invisible
forces
that
affected
the body such
as
pressure and inertia, weight and attraction, gravity and growth. Force
was the condition of sensation. Cezanne's genius had shown
the
slippage of mountains, the growing of apples, the thermal push of
landscape, while Van Gogh had pictured the turbulence of all living
things. Bacon's genius lay in seeking out the forces oppressing his
heads and
figures,
their agitation under stress and pressure,
their
dilation and contraction,
their swelling and withdrawal, rather like
the
forces
affecting
a space
traveller
in
a
capsule.
In
painting
a
scream. Bacon showed
all the energies that had expelled
it, a cr>
at
not being. Although mentally pessimistic, he was nervously optimis-
tic, and so he painted the violence of the sensation of the scream,
not the terror of it. With Beckett, he spoke for a ver\ intense life, not
for a belief in death or horror. Their human figures were uncon-
querable. They endured by their insistence and their presence, even
when
threatened by
mutilation
or
failure
or
fall. Bacon was
the
detector of the forces that made life work.
Under
the
action
of
these
forces,
sensation
passed
through
different levels and degrees. If two sensations confronted each other,
they were treated differently, but both were matter of fact. 'What
is
painted
is
the
sensation.' Yet
the images of two men
copulating

To Define the Undefinable
261
could
unify. Bodies could crush together under the vigour of the
coupling. This
did
not
contradict Bacon's
principle
of isolation,
because there was a single sensation linking the two figures. In his
triptychs, indeed, Bacon implied no progression and no story. They
only incarnated
at times
a common
fact
for the separate
figures.
Bacon particularly admired Cezanne's ^Bathers' because the figures
were united on the
canvas, but
it did not have
a
narrative. The
ancient religious triptychs, indeed, had been mobile paintings, with
shutters that opened for the viewers, and that is why Bacon inserted
his witnesses in his triptychs and included forced movement and a
circular organisation of space.
DeLeuze began
to run
into
difficulties when
trying
to
find an
order in Bacon's triptychs. He
first saw in them three rhythms and
three figures, and then rhythms as witnesses, and finally active and
passive rhythms. But he had to admit that Bacon had the freedom to
combine these elements as he chose - if they existed, that is. He also
saw in the triptychs forces of isolation and deformation and dissipa-
tion, held together by a unity of colours. This led DeLeuze to find
principles
in the
triple paintings: the maximum unity of light and
colour contrasted with the maximum division of the
figures. That
was a lesson from Rembrandt: light engendered rhythmic people -
whoever these were.
DeLeuze was faced with the problem that Bacon had so often told
his English
critics how much
his paintings depended on luck or
accident. The Frenchman
countered
with
the
assertion
that no
painter ever stood before a white canvas. He had many things in his
head, around him, within the studio. All were present potentially on
the canvas. The
artist did not
fill the blank surface, he emptied
it,
uncluttered
it, dusted
it off. He did not reproduce a model, he had
donnees or
gifts of ideas. He had done
his preparatory work well
before he picked up a brush. He must rid himself of all the figurative
cliches, such as photographs and cinema images, although he could
transform them
as Cezanne had transformed
the
apple
into
the
essence of the apple. Had not D.H. Lawrence written that Cezanne's
apple was more important than Plato's ideas.^ The painter must find
the real form and content of things, he must discover a true look

262
Francis Bacon
beyond photography. His
battle was
against the cHche with every
painting that he started.
Although Bacon depended on photographs, he thought they had
no
aesthetic
value. This
is why he
liked Muybridge's
studies
of
motion and manuals on radiography. These captured the happening,
the inner nerves, the
fact. This radical
hostility to the photograph
stopped him from incorporating
it
in
his paintings -
as Hockney
did with his Polaroids of swimming-pools. When Bacon painted a
camera, he made
it look like the head of a prehistoric beast or an
elephant gun. DeLeuze ignored the painted mug shots, which Bacon
sometimes stuck
in his
triptychs, and became even more troubled
and
rational
in explaining Bacon's
reliance on luck and
accident.
This seemed
a sentimental
attitude
to DeLeuze, who considered
that
the
artist must have
precise
rules
of rejection of his
failed
pictures. He might talk of luck to his friends, but he did not seem
able
to understand
its
precise
role. He had thought
the
picture
through before he used some luck to paint
it.
'On the canvas', DeLeuze wrote,
'is an order of equal or unequal
probabilities'. Accidental strokes of the brush might liberate some of
these possibilities, but they did not signify all of them. Am-way, they
were only the result of the hand of the painter destroying the cliche.
They were manual marks which made the Figure spring out into a
visual image. In that sense, luck could be seen as a certain t\pe of
act or choice. For Bacon, luck was not separable from the possibilit)
of using
it.
It was manipulated luck as distinct from conceived or seen
possibilities.
Bacon had a concept before he began to paint a picture, even
if
the concept changed during the painting of
it. The hazard of the
brush-stroke did not create a picture, which was made by the whole
act of painting.
All
the brush did was
to
'extract
the improbable
Figure from the ensemble of all figurative probabilities'. There was
even
a
science
of probability,
and Bacon had
stacked up
those
probabilities
before
he
began
to
paint. He
used
his
choice
of
probabilities to extract one of them by manipulating his brush in the
art of painting. And so he made a picture.
Through
Bacon's
obstinacy, DeLeuze
wrote, and
through
the
incomprehension of his English interviewers, he declared that luck

To Define the Undefinable
263
and accident created his pictures. But he did really know what he
wanted to do. He did not always know how to make
it happen. He
relied on the 'chance' of brush-strokes to achieve his intent. Yet that
was not the problem of the modern painter, who did not have
to
enter the canvas so much as get out of the cliche. The 'chance' of
the brush-stroke gave him that possibility. He had to use cunning
and repetition and prudence to conquer the cliche and each painting
was a new struggle. But it was the only way to the Figure.
This brilliant denial of Bacon's insistence on his use of luck in
painting was immediately followed by DeLeuze stating that we did
not
listen enough
to what painters
said. They declared
that the
painter was already in the canvas, before he began work. Admittedly,
Bacon did not do sketches as other painters did before starting on a
picture.
All the same, he must do
invisible,
silent,
intense prep-
aration, which
led him on
to
hysterical
action -
actually Bacon
himself spoke of this process as long periods of daydreaming. But to
DeLeuze, Bacon's use of chance - putting dust on paintings,
or
using the magnified skin of a rhinoceros or a portrait, or throwing
paint to suggest a jet of water - these were mental choices, although
done by hand. The fingers might seem independent as they used
Brillo pads and cashmere sweaters, scrubbing brushes and cotton
wool, rags and sponges, paint-tube caps and slop buckets as well
as
artists' brushes, but they only worked under the direction and
organisation of the sovereign eye. That was the act of painting. A
picture could
fail twice over visually or manually. But in creating a
painting, the artist introduced 'possibilities of fact'.
The painter entered chaos and tried to leave
it. Abstract art did so
with codes, abstract expressionism with a geometry of the canvas,
and Bacon with
a diagram
in
his head and
a
logic of sensation,
mainly of colours. He followed Cezanne in creating a sensation of
endurance and clarity. Cezanne had told the Impressionists to 'treat
nature by the cylinder, the sphere, the cone,
all put in perspective':
to this Bacon added the cube.
It was an analogy with geometry, and
painting was the art of analogy. Cezanne's chief work was to create a
modulation of colour. By doing so, he 'realised' sensation. And so
did Bacon, using a
similar method
to pass
in
a picture from the
possibility of the fact to the fact of the final work.

264
Francis Bacon
There were huge differences between Bacon and Cezanne, but
also correspondences. Bacon was the
heir of the post-Cubism of
Picasso and Braque, and this was evident in his use of the junctions
between the
vertical and the horizontal and of slabs of colour
as
space. He also employed the deformation of the naked body rather
than Cezanne's emphasis on form in clothes. But he did push to the
extreme the use of painting as a language of analogv', he did employ
cylinders and geometrical shapes
to suggest volume and
distance,
and above all, he relied on lines and colours to constitute the Figure.
DeLeuze now
stated
that
each
great
painter
in
his
manner
resumed the history of painting. Bacon admired Egyptian
art. He
liked
its flatness and
its contours, the form and the background on
the same plan, the presence of the Figure, and the precision of the
work. He had even wanted
to do
sculpture
himself, but he had
discarded the idea. What he did was to expand Cezanne's systems of
colour sequences and modulations - Lawrence Gowing had written
on these as well as on Bacon. Bacon was not eclectic, but he stopped
at points in the history of painting, at Egyptian art and Grunewald,
at Rembrandt and Velazquez, at Van Gogh and Degas and Picasso,
to
recreate
them
in
his own
way. To
Egyptian
formalism,
for
instance, he added the
fall, the accident, and catastrophe. He even
added to his art the eye of the cyclone of Turner. And he particularly
used colour to escape from the classical past. For him, light was time
and colour was space.
It was Cezanne who had put order back into
colour by following the succession of the spectrum, while Van Gogh
had vaunted himself to his brother Theo as an 'arbitrary colourist'.
After him and Gauguin - much criticised by Cezanne - Bacon was
one of the
greatest of colourists.
Indeed, he had
left
his sombre
period with his paintings of Van Gogh on the road in the South of
France.
The three elements
in Bacon's
painting,
the
structure and
the
Figure and the contour, all converged in a unity of colour. The space
in his pictures was crossed by large washes of colour. The tript\chs
were held together by bright monochromes of orange,
red, ochre,
golden-yellow, green, violet and pink, also by cur\'ilinear contours.
These were the linking bands of colour and hue. Yet the counter-
pointed figures were
full of the broken tones of blue and red, the

To Define the Undefinable
265
colours of the flesh. Often their shadows were black or lively, as real
as the bodies. Colour and structure gave way to colour and force,
which would
subordinate
the
contour. But
in
the
end, both
the
Figure and the contour communicated and converged in the colour.
It was
not enough
to
say
that
the
eye judged and
the hand
operated. There was a rich rapport between the two in every great
artist. Yet
in Bacon's
case, even
if there was
occasional manual
insubordination, the picture was prefabricated.
It pre-existed in his
mind. He only used the hand and the brush to take a shape out of
nature, called the Figure. Rarely did he change from one concept to
another, although in his early 'Figure in a Landscape' of 1945-46,
he did begin to paint a bird alighting in a field and end with a man
asleep under an umbrella. Even then,
his mind released
a more
profound image than the senses could discern. His mental picture or
diagram allowed him to pass from the bird to the umbrella.
It was
the agent of transformation, aided by the accident of the brush. The
mind and reason controlled through a logic of sensation expressed
in
a
convergence
through
colours.
So
Bacon
passed
from
the
possibility of fact to the pictorial fact.
DeLeuze had defined the undefinable. He had demonstrated how
French logic could cage the hazard in Bacon's art rather as the artist
himself put his cylinder and cubes round his figures to confine them
inside the canvas. Both Leiris and DeLeuze categorised Bacon to
himself. Largely, he accepted their rationalisations in terms of the
French
clarity of expression, which he
so much admired. Their
essays on his works were a reductio ad mentem of all other art criticism.
But Bacon
did
not
accept
these French
analyses when he was
speaking to the English with their pragmatic values, nor did they
apply to the facts of his own life, although they might to many of the
facts of his
art. Rather like King Lear in the play which he most
valued by Shakespeare, Bacon both played the Philosopher to the
French in the manner of his great Jacobean namesake, and the Fool
to the
English. Across the Channel,
his
art was more
logical.
In
London, his art was more lucky.
The
fact was that his
art was logic and
luck. As DeLeuze had
written, the problem for the artist was to pluck order out of chaos.
Each picture was a new batde every time
it was started: as Heraclitus

266
Francis Bacon
had
stated,
the sun was new every day. Bacon did
actually allow
accident to make up part of his paintings - the golden shower of a
companion
for the night, the dust from the studio
floor, the rain-
drops through the leaky skylight. But these contributions of chance
had
to
pass
the
scrutiny
of
his waking
eye.
As
he
told
David
Sylvester,
it was
'really a continuous question of the fight benveen
accident
and
criticism'.
But
for DeLeuze,
sight was
sovereign,
whatever the slip of the hand or natural causes. Through the optic
nerves, the mind was the final judge of when a picture was complete,
whatever happenstance
affected
its
composition.
Yet even
so,
in
Bacon's ironic and impish cast of mind, some accidents and spatters
were allowed to remain on the final works just because they seemed
appropriate as the marks of that particular moment.
The French rationalists also discounted Bacon's statements as late
as the
'sixties that he was trying to paint a history of the past thirty
years and after that, an autobiography. Influenced by the fashionable
theories of Structuralism and Deconstruction, the Parisians put little
emphasis on the influence of social or personal history on an artist's
work. The paintings existed as they were.
It was the job of the critic
to make them more
real to the viewer. So DeLeuze talked of the
logic
of
sensation,
the
intense
feeling
of the
painter which
he
translated onto
the
canvas. But Bacon's most gripping sensations
were in his personal life, and he was particularly affected by George
Dyer's death in Paris, even painting a triptych of that tragedy which
was totally an autobiographical narrative. There was no logic in that
sensation of grief. There might be a logic in his use of colours and
contours and spaces and figures, but he often said that the sensation
of love
for another man interfered with his painting and with the
sensation he
felt •'for
his
art. The personal
feeling did not always
translate into an emotion on the canvas.
Equally,
Bacon's
continual
stress on
the power of chance and
instinct in his painting, his insistence that his original concept for a
picture was mutated by accident or brush-stroke or sponge or rag,
these assertions were substantiated by his way of work and
life. The
hodge-podge of photographs tacked up on boards on his wall, the
pages
ripped from
art books,
the
clutter of paint-tubes and
old
clothes on the dirty studio floor, this chaos of facts was seized upon

To Define the Undefinable
267
during
the
act
of painting and changed
the
final work through
whatever came to finger or eye, from the photograph of a man with
a monkey to a handful of dust. While Bacon's mind was logical, his
thought was affected not only by the debris of his surroundings, but
by his health and nervous system. He had high blood-pressure as
well as asthma, he suffered from bad hangovers after his drinking
bouts, and he took too many barbiturates to make himself sleep, so
that rising each morning made him feel like a daily Lazarus escaping
a recent death. In the sensation and the act of painting, he did truly
become
alive, and
in a way, he exorcised the excesses of his
life
through his work. But the night before and the drugs and his dodgy
health entered into his paintings as well as his logic and his overall
eye of judgement, which pronounced the final sentence - to preserve
or to hack to bits.
Except for a brief reference to Proust and memory, DeLeuze also
seemed to ignore the considerable influence on Bacon's painting of
the visual storehouse of images, which the artist had amassed since
his childhood in Ireland. Bacon admitted that he did paint from the
unconscious and from the pictures retained in his mind's eye from
his past life. He thought of the unconscious as a deep sea, which he
knew nothing about; but he hoped the most wonderful images would
emerge from
it. In a sense, the sweep of the paint-brush was to him
the taste of the petite madeleine that led Proust back to the scenes of
his childhood. Bacon called the result of that unconscious recreation
a matter of luck, although the final outcome was a matter of fact.
It
was similar to Samuel Taylor Coleridge's claim that 'Xanadu' was
dashed off at the end of an opium dream and interrupted for ever by
the arrival of the man from Porlock. The brilliant study of him. The
Road to Xanadu, by John Livingstone Lowes, conclusively proved that
he had been hoarding in his mind the phrases and visions of the
poem for many years.
It was the result of wide reading and deep
experience.
It was
so with Bacon. His
seventy years of personal
wondering and wandering, of moving and
staring,
allied with
his
extraordinarily
retentive memory
for
images,
gave him
a
picture
library that sprang out of the canvas with each sweep of his brush.
As with a drowning man, his whole
life was there before his eyes,
standing every morning in front of a blank surface. He could call on

268
Francis Bacon
the multitude of signs and figures that he had laid away to drive any
cliche from his composition.
Furthermore, Bacon used Egyptian and Greek myths as well as
narrative in some of his most powerful portraits and triptvchs, and
he made conscious
allusions
to drama and
to poetr\.
Overtly, he
brought up
the
cruelty of the
Crucifixion and
the power of the
papacy and the spectre of Nazism. He might in
later
life say that
there was no story or message
in his paintings, but he knew that
there had been, and he continued to paint recognisable symbols of
myths into his triptychs into his old age. He preferred to discount
what he had done in view of the brilliant analyses of his rational work
given to him by his French critics.
The greatest gift of DeLeuze to Bacon was the illumination of his
connection with Cezanne. Four years after the book was published,
an exhibition of Cezanne: The Early Years i8sg-i8j2 was mounted
at the Royal Academy in London, and these curiously obsessive early
paintings riveted Bacon, who visited the show many times, scrutinis-
ing the pictures with his eagle-eyed vision. As Sam Hunter wrote.
Bacon
relished
'the
strangely
unfinished,
touching
images
of
Cezanne's
family and
intimate
circle of friends and
his violendy
erotic
inventions,
with
their
fresh,
contemporary
spirit and
vital
handling. The
combination
of evident
gaucherie
and
expressive
power
within
a
once -derided
system
of
figuration
that
is
now-
recognised
as
clearly
original
particularly moved
Bacon.' He had
learned of Cezanne's system of colours, reminiscent of the therapeu-
tic use of the spectrum invented for the Australian wounded soldiers
in the
First World War by his
original mentor, Roy de Maistre.
Although
his use of his palette and particularly of acrylic paint
to
cover large areas^did seem
to emerge from
his own imagination.
Bacon
also relished the
link
to the radical Cezanne, perceived by
French logic.
What the Parisians did not understand was one of the few English
conventions which Bacon had adopted. This most intelligent
artist
tried
to
escape from
the
pressures of his
incessant mind
in
the
company of the amiable and the criminal. With his raffish friends,
he
said what any Anglo-Irish gendeman would,
particularly
if he
were an artist. He did not really work at
it or think
it out.
It was all a

To Define the Undefinable
269
matter of luck. When someone said in a Soho pub that Bacon was a
painter, and then he was asked to paint somebody else's house, he
merely said that he was busy and did not say he was an artist. Indeed,
he compared the
first marks on a canvas
to painting a wall. The
brush made the dash,
it had the vitality. Unless that primal mark was
right, the wall and the picture would be lost.
Conversely,
to the international
art EstabUshment, Bacon could
be extremely rigid and precise about the intention and execution of
his painting, particularly after his education from his French critics.
He used to quote DeLeuze in order to present himself merely as a
maker of images and to deny any relationship between the figures in
his triptychs. He would talk in 1985 of creating images which were
'a concentration of reality and a shorthand of sensation'. He had 'to
abbreviate into intensity'. Equally, to guard his refusal to explain his
work, he might say that he did not try to read
it.
'I only know what it
means to me formally.' A painting was a visual shock without a story.
There was nothing in it 'except what people want to read into
it'.
Taught by the French to leave the message of a picture of his to
the viewer's judgement. Bacon was not duplicitous when he told the
English interviewers and
his Soho friends that he threw paint on
pictures, and how they turned out was a matter of luck. His triptychs
just happened to join up, and his instinct told him when they were
finished. This was
his understated answer to
British people, who
hated
the
serious
or
the
uppity, and who found
logical
analysis
'boring'. As he spoke and knew the idioms of both countries, he
attuned his responses to his hearers. In England he did as he had
been taught in Ireland. 'Speak as you're spoken to
.
.
. Don't put on
airs
.
.
. Above
all, don't be clever.' In France, he did the opposite,
explaining the
logic of his
acts of painting. Both statements were
true
for
a painter always hoping that
his
battle
against the blank
canvas, his endless skirmishes between concept and chance, would
work out by design and instinct.
He had several languages - logical, dismissive, exact, witty, wise
and camp. They were all different ways of expressing the same thing.
He
tried
to make
a game of his
life
as well as of his
art, and he
played
it to the full, but always in pursuit of the fact. That was what
he called the
real or the
truth. And the truth was that no
logical

270
Francis Bacon
analysis could remove the accident or the hazard from his living or
his method of working. He knew that and said so in England; but
it
did not suit the acute reasoning powers of the French critics. Both
their victim and their exploiter, Bacon redefined his intentions largely
in their terms; but he could not deny the gambling streak in what he
did.
Curiously enough, DeLeuze referred to Bacon betting on three
roulette tables at once and added that he painted his triptychs in the
same way, but he did not follow up on such a brilliant analogy. And
on the back of his book on Bacon, he printed the strips of Photomat
images, which Bacon knocked off to serve as the haphazard models
for his self-portraits.
It was an odd postscript to a thesis on Francis
Bacon:
The Logic of Sensation. The
logic of Bacon's painting was
intermittent:
his
life was wayward, but he loved those who would
give
it and him a convincing coherence. As he now said, admitting
his contradictions, he beUeved in 'a deep ordered chaos' in his work,
plucked out by luck.

13
A Deep Ordered Chaos
Costly followers are not to be liked; lest while a man maketh
his train longer, he make his wings shorter.
I reckon to be
costly, not them alone which charge the purse, but which are
wearisome and importune in suits.
'Of Followers and Friends'
by Francis Bacon, Lord Verulam,
Viscount St. Albans
In the 'eighties, the ageing Bacon, now in his seventies but looking
twenty years younger, continued
to defy time and chaos. He did
achieve a deep order in his work and an ^ebullient despair' in his Ufe.
The reason for his curious happiness and unusual sense of security
lay in his relationship with John Edwards.
It was the role of an old
master, who had finally defined his art to himself, teaching a pupil,
whose animal strength and quick Cockney wit made him an admir-
able model and pupil.
It was the reversal of the role which Bacon
had once
played with Roy de
Maistre. With
the
death
of John
Deakin, Edwards took over the role of Bacon's photographer, and if
he did not pose in the flesh for the artist, he provided the snapshots
of the desired subject matter, man or beast.
The
triptych
of John Edwards which Bacon
painted
in
1984
already showed an increasing tenderness for him.
It was one of the
few portraits that the
artist thought had really worked. In some of
the previous ones, Edwards had been fairly deformed, even though
Bacon thought that they
all looked
like him.
Increasingly,
in
the
*Study for Portrait of John Edwards' of 1986 and 1988, the stocky

272
Francis Bacon
and rounded muscle of the figure
is described in
its beaut}
, and the
buccaneering face left undistorted in forceful profile or full-face. In
his fresh-found certainty, Bacon was depicting the man most close to
him without wavering or exaggeration.
It was reality;
it was the fact.
As
a young man, Bacon had
often
stayed with
his
first cousin
Pamela Firth, now Mrs Matthews, the wife of an American magazine
editor,
at Cavendish Hall
in
Suffolk. There he had dressed
as
a
flapper for a fancy dress ball and had declared his preferences and
intentions. Now he moved back, staying in 'The Croft' outside Long
Melford
nearby,
a gamekeeper's
cottage
that was
gentrified with
mock-Tudor beams and a garage after
its purchase by David, the
brother of John Edwards. Soon Bacon was to acquire as a country
studio the headmaster's house at the rear of the old village school, a
Victorian redbrick copy of Melford
Hall,
the
great house of the
village, which now belonged to the National Trust. The aged parents
of the Edwards brothers ended by living there. This return was
a
curious and Proustian reversion to time past for Bacon,
trving
to
recover some
happy moments
of his
adolescence
at
aristocratic
Cavendish Hall, yet intruding on the close-knit Suffolk societ}' with
the
Edwards
family from
the
East End
of London.
For John's
brothers and their friends would join Bacon in Long Melford, where
they would become the largest landowners in the village and richer
than the Firths had been. With their new wealthy connections, this
rising Cockney
family would outdo
the
heirs
of the
Anglo-Irish
Ascendancy, who had fled the troubles back to their homeland.
For Bacon was becoming a millionaire. The prices of his paintings
were soaring
in the boom years of the
'eighties. The
triptych of
George Dyer, which he had painted after his lover's death in Paris
in
1 97 1, was
sold ten years
later
at
Christie's
in New York
for
$350,000. Five years on, another memorial portrait of Dyer clasping
a lavatory pedestal, 'Seated Figure' of 1978, was sold by Christie's
in New York
for
$935,000,
turning Bacon
into
Britain's
most
expensive living artist, outpricing even the works of the late Henr>
Moore. Although these huge sums of money might benefit some of
Bacon's
costly
followers, who had
received
gifts of his work,
the
artist himself remained
totally
indifferent
to the
fortune
that was
coming his way. As long as Marlborough Fine Art looked after his

A Deep Ordered Chaos
273
business affairs and kept his pockets full of rolls of fifty-pound notes,
he went on living in the same style as he had for the past thirty years.
He hated the growing commercialism of art, and he thought those
who bought modern pictures were more influenced by money than
by good painting. He said he was surprised his paintings sold at all,
as he painted them for himself, and they were about his personal
life. He had always thought he would have to take some other kind
of job to paint at all - but that was the luck of his Hfe. He could live
off his obsession, what he tried to do.
Luck played less of a part in his philosophy and his Hfe in his old
age. A
certain
definition was
creeping upon
him.
Although
he
remained a nihilist, he said that his nature was optimistic. Something
exciting was going to turn up. He remained greedy for life and as an
artist. Anything he could not get by logic, he wanted chance to give
him. He loved food and drink and the company of friends, the good
things of the moment. All artists were greedy for themselves.
'I just
take what I can find.' This was not uncommon among artists.
'I think
all people who create are like that. Painting
is about nothing more
than what it does to me.'
Yet even
if Bacon believed
in nothing,
that 'we
are born and
we
die and that's
it', he was profoundly optimistic about nothing.
Existing each day made him optimistic. His impulse was
his
life,
drifting from bar to bar, and working as if he would live for ever. He
insisted now that he was not tormented. He did not worry about life
and had no sense of sin. He was lucky in that way, but he had not
been brought up to feel guilty. Only if he tried consciously to bring
harm to somebody else would he feel he had committed a sin.
Bacon might be imposing some order on the chaos around him,
but he
still insisted that the images he created were more than the
products of his intellect. Life itself was nothing but sensation, what
he
felt, what happened
to him.
In
his day dreams, he could see
'masses
of
flesh
out
of which
every
so
often
images
emerged.'
Although art was artificial, the intense use of the brush or whatever
happened to come to hand allowed some forms to form themselves.
Although occasionally the work flowed out of him, usually he painted
in despair of the result and found
it more helpful, because
it made
him take greater risks in forming radical and final shapes. The rapid

274
Francis Bacon
movement
of the
brush,
the
manipulation
of the
paint and
the
colours, these altered the implications of the image.
It was difficult
working in
oils. He created an image and
it was changing
all the
time.
It had
to do with his
instinct and
his
sensibility, which also
veered and wavered.
That was why he painted so
fiercely and
rapidly, assaulting the
canvas. He liked the starkness of what he did. He wanted
it to give
him
a
visual shock
like
a sneak
attack on
the
senses. Even
his
triptychs, which
appeared
to
have
a
strong
unity,
were
painted
separately and quickly. First, he could only get one large canvas at a
time into his small studio. Second, he had to paint them fast so that
they would
achieve
the
sort
of togetherness
that
the panoramic
screen had in the Soho cinema which had installed
it. But finally, he
claimed that, whatever his methods of working on his tript}chs, they
just happened to join up.
With the growing influence of the Edwards family on him. Bacon
began to detach himself from his artistic friends, particularly Lucian
Freud and Frank Auerbach. He had always said that he felt isolated
as an artist. He envied the relationship of Yeats and Eliot and Pound,
all working together and having a strong influence on each other.
But he had to work alone and began
to
resist the criticism of his
English circle, although not the appreciation of his friends in France.
Auerbach told Stephen Spender in March, 1982, that he no longer
saw much
of Francis
Bacon. He
did
not
think
that
they
had
quarrelled, but 'friendships wear out'. Spender did not want to admit
that, but he also was seeing less of Bacon, although the
artist had
visited him in 1980 when he was in hospital with both legs in plaster,
and had presented him with a case of '71 Rothschild Lafite claret.
With Lucian Frei^d, however, there was a definite falling-out, which
was to culminate in Freud's refusal to loan Bacon's early picture of
two men wrestling or coupling to his second retrospective exhibition
at the Tate
Gallery. When Michael Wishart saw the picture
still
hanging in Freud's Coombe
Prior}^ in Dorset, he was reminded of
Mae West's question: 'If it's all in, why wrestle.^' Bacon could never
understand
Freud's
refusal,
asking
Wishart why
Freud
was
so
unfriendly. Had he sold the picture.^ When Wishart and he went to
the Freud retrospective at the Hayward Gallery, Bacon riposted by

A Deep Ordered Chaos
275
saying,
Well,
Lucian's
extremely
gifted,
but
I've
never
been
interested
in
Expressionism.' The
rift remained. When Wishart
reported to Bacon that Freud v^ould not see him again 'because his
conversation is so repetitious'. Bacon retorted that he would not see
Freud again 'because his w^ork is so repetitious'.
The breach between Bacon and Graham Sutherland had
also
proved irreparable. Daniel Farson gave them a drink of reconciliation
in Jules Bar in Jermyn Street. As he told the story in his book Sacred
Monsters, the two artists at first rejoiced like long-lost brothers, and
Bacon
invited
Sutherland and
his wife and Farson
to
dinner
at
Wheeler's
in Old Compton
Street. Something went wrong there.
The mood changed. When Sutherland
said with the
sweetest of
smiles that he had been doing some portraits and had Bacon seen
any of them, his old friend repHed that he had. They were 'very nice
if you like the covers of Time magazine'. And to Michael Wishart,
Sutherland wrote that he did not regret the break with Bacon: 'The
association was becoming too acid and boring to support and
I had
my own thoughts to try to expand in peace.'
Yet Bacon was courtesy itself to his favoured collectors, whom he
treated with a firm delicacy. The American financier, Donald Hess,
and his wife used to meet the
artist at the Connaught, where they
always found him charming and intelligent and critical - and never
drunk. He spoke openly of his homosexuality and urge
for
self-
destruction. 'We
all have our problems and
I am an artist. Painting
is how
I overcome them.' As his art developed, he grew stronger.
His dedication enabled him to subdue his
frailties. To the Hesses,
he appeared always the Anglo-Irish gentleman of his birth. But when
Donald Hess telephoned Bacon to ask him if he might remove the
heavy frames and glass from his paintings because they distorted the
images and showed the living-room in the pictures. Bacon replied,
'But
I want you and your place inside my picture.
It makes you see
my picture.
If you change that frame or glass, you will never buy
another picture from me.'
Bacon was equally courteous to his East End friend John Edwards,
who was introduced
to the habitues of the Colony Room such as
Daniel Farson and George Melly, although that club was not the
same
after Muriel
Belcher's
death. But when
its new owner Ian

276
Francis Bacon
Board was
told
that Soho was not what
it used
to be, he always
replied,
'It never was.' What the
club needed was
the
agile and
commanding presence of Francis Bacon, no longer hired as its tout,
but become
its
big
spender. 'When
Francis
arrives', one
of the
regulars said,
'it's as if the place has been in darkness, and everyone
suddenly becomes alive and
alert and
full of vitalit\\
I've seen him
do that without even opening his mouth.' But his usual restaurants
were being transformed. Wheeler's in Old Compton Street became
part of a chain, and L'Escargot nearby had been refurbished. Bacon
still visited these old haunts, but more rarely, telling the proprietors
of the freshened L'Escargot that
it looked like an ice-cream parlour.
The French Pub had not altered and he
still went there frequently.
As its proprietor Gaston Berlemont said, the customers changed, but
they stayed the same. 'The crowd we have now is just a carbon copy
of the same crowd that was coming in forty or fifty years ago when
I
was a boy. They are the same type of people. Our type. People who
like
life, who
like
to drink wine and enjoy each other's company.
They themselves
create an atmosphere.
It's no use
putting up
a
couple of plastic onions and saying that you're creating a French
atmosphere,
it doesn't work like that.'
The fame of Bacon grew faster than his train of followers. Small
or large exhibitions of his work went on show^ in Tours and at the
Galerie Maeght as well as through the donation of the Kahnweiler-
Leiris
collection
to
the Musee National d'Art Moderne
in
Paris.
Marlborough
Fine
Art continued
to
exhibit
his
recent works
in
London and New York, and he was
also represented
in shows
at
Yale in New Haven and Chicago, in Sheffield and Edinburgh, and
in Amsterdam and Lausanne. He broke through to Japan, where an
exhibition travelled from Tokyo
to Kyoto and Osaka and Nagoya.
But
the
culmination
of
this
period
of work would be
a second
retrospective
at the Tate
Gallery, twenty-five years
after the
first,
and destined to transfer to Stuttgart and Berlin, after two previous
small
showings
in
Germany
at
Hanover
and
Cologne.
It
was
sponsored
by
Global
Assets,
a company
directed
by
Gilbert
de
Botton,
a married Swiss financier and
art collector who would be
painted by Bacon in a hotel bedroom, as if he were shot unawares by
Jean-Luc Godard, whose
film images were
a major influence on

to
capture
a
fugitive
reality. De
Botton had
to
produce masses of photographs
for the painting, some taken
at a
conference, others by his son in rear view. He never knew what the
portrait would
look
like because of Bacon's ^enormous
shyness'.
Finally,
it showed him speaking into a mirror while adjusting his tie
before pushing his rumpled shirt into his trousers. He stares through
round spectacles at himself, caught in the act of dressing. His face is
vivid with the effort to communicate and is without distortion except
for
a
blackish
circle
below
his
open mouth -
the
shape
of a
microphone taken from the conference photograph of him.
Bacon's most spectacular painting of the period was one based on
that of Ingres in 'Oedipus and the Sphinx'. He had always admired
Ingres as one of the greatest painters of female
flesh, much as he
might prefer male flesh himself In his opinion, Ingres had created
some of the most sexual bodies ever made in painting. He had to
have loved women's flesh to have created the figures in his 'Turkish
Bath'. But his nude male Oedipus addressing the female breasts of
the Sphinx was voluptuous and muscular, and the shape suggested
to Bacon
the
image
of a
bull-necked
thug
in
vest and
shorts,
adjusting a bloody bandage round his right leg and left foot, stuck
up on an empty book-case. As Andrew Forge described the painting
in his perceptive book on Francis Bacon with Dawn Ades, pubHshed
in 1985 to accompany the second Tate retrospective:
His limbs are massive, but even more massive is his short neck, a
stubby cylinder nearly twice as thick as his calf The head sprouts
out of it, a flattened half-transparent knob, the sheen on jaw and
cheek floating over the rounded poll as though glassy axe blows
had uncovered the movement of the
face against the
light. The
tender pink orifice of the ear is low down, at the hinge of the jaw.
Sphinx and man are at opposite sides of a room. The walls are
of flat cyclamen pink, the floor beige. The Sphinx is half out of the
left side of the frame. Its torso is like a light urn on slender footing,
its breast and the root of its wings smoothly turned. This suggestion
of symmetry seems to speak of an alternative anatomy, opposite to
the man's virile maimed weight. The Sphinx's neck
is thick
like
the man's but smoothly graded like the lid of an urn in contrast to
Oedipus' brown heavily modelled stump. The Sphinx is an appar-
ition outside time. Its head is turned towards Oedipus alertly, as if

278
Francis Bacon
to focus
its glance upon him, but
its face
is veiled.
It
is as though
the
face
-
the
face
of
a
handsome,
full-lipped man
-
was
encapsulated within the head, screened by an opalescent covering.
The stare we look for is withheld.
In Ingres' painting there
is a witness to the encounter with the
Sphinx, a companion of Oedipus' who turns with a fearful gesture
before running
off down
the
hillside.
Bacon's
witness
is more
central. Between the two pink walls there
is a door open to the
darkness of the
night.
Set
into
the door
is
a
plate
glass
sheet
covering three quarters of the opening. Hung
at the
top of the
glass, smashed against
it, crawling up
it or looking at us through
it,
is one of those stumped-pawed, pod-bodied chimeras that Bacon
has identified as Eumenides. The body ends in a long crest or tail
and a round hole - eye or anus - cleanly drilled as if by Black and
Decker or bullet.
This being, too,
is bloody. One could picture
it as a fragment of
offal thrown and stuck, half dried, to the glass. But
it is avidly alive
too. A white arrow points
to
the
centre
of
its
bloodiness, and
beyond
to the marble-like breast of the Sphinx. An
ellipse,
like
an enormous sHde-frame, partially encloses the creature. Similar
devices frame Oedipus, enclosing his torso and hanging over his
broken foot like a halo.
In Ingres, Oedipus and Sphinx stare intendy into each other's
eyes, their hands almost touching. Oedipus has put his question
and, his eye focused to a point,
is listening intendy to her reply.
The Sphinx
is speaking, her head arched like an angr\' swan, her
wings
erect. Her
face has
that look of flashing
fur>-
that opera
singers take on at moments of greatest projection. In Bacon,
it
is
doubtful whether the question has or ever will be put into words.
It
is
implicit, not in Oedipus' gesture - his bandage absorbs
his
attention - but in the Sphinx's turned head, and in the memor\- of
the earlier picture which haunts our reading.
Two extraordinary paintings of a 'Sand Dune' and one of *A Piece
of Waste Land' also signalled new departures for Bacon. The
first
sand dune enhanced his previous painting of a
jet of water. There
were
overflow
pipes
and
bathroom
fittings
and
a
sea
horizon
containing a misty, grassy, animal form of pinkish browns, nature in
movement against the set traps of civilisation. The hazy^ effect was
created, indeed, by using an aerosol spray. The second 'Sand Dune'
was overtly a human torso gone to ground, sliced off by a panoramic

A Deep Ordered Chaos
279
screen of sky enclosed by the red walls of a room. It seemed alive, as
did 'A Piece of Waste Land', a sprawling weedy shape, littered with
crumpled newspaper, and reaching to the
arc of the edge of the
world. The effect of all of them was to find wild life in the earth, as
if digging a badger from its set.
Bacon also developed his paintings of the naked torso in cricket
pads,
set against an orange background. 'Study from the Human
Body - Figure in Movement' of 1982, had the male thighs whirling
round with a push of penis and flailing arms in the attitude of a naked
wicket-keeper stumping a reckless batsman. In the left-hand panel of
the diptych of
1 982-1 984 of 'Studies from the Human Body', the
wicket-keeper crouches on a
trestle
table, stretching out his huge
gloves in his traditional position behind the stumps, his shoulders a
pair of naked buttocks with two light cords hanging above them. But
the right-hand panel
is
subtitled 'from a Drawing by Ingres' and
shows a female torso
sitting on a slab, newsprint and a red arrow
veiling her calves and indicating her sex, while her headless shoulders
swell into her two breasts. The ultimate of this series of images
is
depicted in 'Figure in a Movement' of 1985, where the wicket-keeper
wears his white flannels and seems to have smashed the ball into the
bails, for his head is shrieking in protest or more likely, 'How's that.^',
as Bacon might well ask himself on the completion of any painting.
Two curious works of the period were experiments that were not
pursued.
In
'Statue and Figures
in
a
Street',
a hunched male
is
caged in a trapezoid within other geonometrical snares, while along
a track that looks like a plank, small blurs of strollers like Giacometti
people walk by without concern. But more strange was Bacon's effort
to paint the star of the Rolling Stones, 'Three Studies for Portrait
(Mick Jagger)'. For the first time. Bacon appeared to be approaching
Pop Art, a sort of smeared Andy Warhol or Roy Lichtenstein. There
is hardly an effort 'to deform into reality', as the artist claimed of his
intentions in portraits. The beauty of the rock singer's bone structure
and the sensuality of his mouth are shown with love and care, while
only maroon stripes over the eyes suggest the fury and the force of
his performance. Some critics declared that the Jagger portraits were
so bland because Bacon dissected the rubbery mask and could find
nothing behind
it.

28o
Francis Bacon
In
the
increasing number of interviews
that Bacon gave
in
the
years before his second retrospective
at the Tate Gallery,
his own
performance became more and more assured, culminating
in two
television appearances with David Sylvester and Melvyn Bragg. He
conquered his slight lisp and knew precisely what he
felt about his
work. As the interviewer for Bacon's profile in 77ie Dtnes discovered,
the painter frequendy thought he was being incoherent, but that was
never the
case. He
said
after making statements with some
self-
admiration, 'Isn't that clearly put.^' He spoke of unlocking the valves
of sensation to bring his viewers nearer to a kind of reality, to make
them more aware without it being a dictatorial awareness. If anguish
came out in his painting, it was because life was packed with anguish,
and
this
fact made
his paintings
the more
realistic. He spoke of
Yeats, saying, 'As an old man he worked on himself, made himself
more remarkable.' Although old age was a bloody nuisance and put
him nearer death, he did not mind 'so long as the brain goes on and
one can move about!' To another interviewer, he said that only what
one did between the two absolute points of birth and death counted.
Anyway, painting was an old man's occupation. The accumulation of
the years had made him more inventive. Some of the greatest artists
had done their best work in old age: Titian and Picasso and others.
'So
I hope
I shall go on and drop dead while working. When
all
is
said and done, what matters is instinct.'
The television appearance with Sylvester was the culmination of
the
art critic having recorded rich and rare interviews with Bacon
over the past twenty-five years. The tide of the programme, 'The
Brutality' of Fact', referred to the
artist's dispraise of Matisse, who
did not have the intention of Picasso and turned fact into lyricism.
'He doesn't have Picasso's brutality of fact.' Bacon himself tried to
trap reality, using the subject as bait. And he like working on his own
in a haze of sensations and ideas so that he could allow the paint to
dictate to him. To Bragg, who filmed him in the cluner of his studio,
Bacon was more open than he had ever been, confessing his sexual
differences with
his
interlocutor and
his
love
of male
flesh, and
allowing John Edwards and his friends at the Colony Room to take a
bow. He stressed that he was not a conversational artist, he preferred

A Deep Ordered Chaos
281
to show violent male couplings, which was a way of cutting out
all
the talk in action. 'Reality', he said, Hs what exists'.
Bacon's methods
of painting and
his
destruction of his
failed
works fascinated
all who managed to approach him. He had never
been to art school nor had he had to learn the techniques he did not
want to know. He had taught himself by fifty years of trial and error.
He sprang straight at the unprimed side of the stretched canvas and
attacked
it with paint. He blocked in a background in thin washes or
even acrylic or house paint, then added his figures in oils in a rush
of sweeping and swirling marks. If anything went wrong at this stage,
he had to destroy the canvas. As he was painting on the absorbent
and woven side of the cloth, he clogged the surface and could never
overpaint
it even if he wished to do so.
It could not be cleaned, as
the paint soaked into the texture of the canvas. An indelible mark
was left behind, and anyway, he could never recapture the accidental
sign made by his original brush-stroke. His very method as well as
his dissatisfaction did imply the destruction of much of what he did.
The oil on his figures, however, remained malleable while it dried.
And he did rework the
figures,
particularly in his
triptychs, even
though these were usually completed in a matter of weeks of intense
energy and concentration. The composition was disturbed by hurling
on paint and using his hands and any other available material
to
smudge or trouble what was already there. Thick impasto and sand
and dust were added in great blobs over fine washes and the weave
of the unprimed surface. After these extreme contrasts in his assaults
on
his
painting. Bacon would suddenly
stop with
his
sensations
exhausted and his intellect satisfied that this time in the process was
the end of it. Sometimes in the work, he lost the best moments in a
painting by trying to take it further, rather as Picasso did in Clouzot's
film about his multiple images of a goat in Le Mystere Picasso. Bacon
would also have liked a camera running to record the figures he had
lost while he was painting, Only rarely
in
his
early years had he
returned to an abandoned picture and had overpainted something
quite
satisfactory on
it. The
picture now must be immediate
or
nothing.
Bacon told his interviewers that he frequently destroyed his work
and usually added that he should have scrapped a great many more.

282
Francis Bacon
while others should be burned. He was glad when his paintings were
sold, because he saw the last of them. His only satisfaction was the
sensation and process of the work itself. His paintings, indeed, were
generally the record of his sensations and his personal
life, so that
he had every right to destroy what displeased him. The problem was
that,
as
his
old
friends such
as Bruce Bernard were
to
discover,
Bacon was also beginning to distort and destroy the evidence of his
actual
life,
to
try and control the recording of the past as he did
painting on a canvas. Increasingly, he liked to dominate what he did
and to select from what he had done.
These were the actions of an old man, who was gambling and
playing young, but who wanted to impose his opinions on his world.
He would not yet divide his domain among his followers, as King
Lear had among his daughters. More and more, his imperious whim
was the dictate of his actions and of those about him. He began to
enjoy his fame and the power
it gave him. 'Not since Turner and
Constable has a British painter achieved such universal recognition,'
Richard Francis
said,
the young curator who was helping him
to
select the best of his works for the second retrospective at the Tate
Gallery. 'The interesting thing is that so many young artists acknowl-
edge his importance and influence without trying to imitate him.'
In imposing
his own
will on
the
accidents
in
his
life,
Bacon
counterpoised the growing influence of the Edwards family from the
East End of London against his French connections; Michel Leiris
and
Gilles DeLeuze;
the French-Canadian Barry Joule, who was
buying a property in Normandy and spending more time there; and
now Gilbert de Botton. In the end, Bacon did arrange for some of
his new fortune to be banked in Switzerland. He would often joke to
his companions that his English accountant had told him to move to
the cantons and the snowy mountains for tax reasons, 'but he could
not stand
all those bloody views'. The truth was that Bacon would
never become a tax exile and long wither out his earnings in a bitter
nostalgia
for where he wished
to be. No
millions saved from the
Inland Revenue were worth the libert}^ of moving freely.
David
Somerset,
soon
to become
the Duke
of Beaufort,
and
Valerie
Beston were
the two
guardians
of Bacon's
fortunes and
reputation
at
Marlborough
Fine
Art.
His
finances
were
never

283
discussed, his expenses were always met on demand. Access to him
was made difficult by his own request, but it was not impossible. As
far as a major artist could be protected from the company he chose
to
keep, Marlborough Fine
Art were admirable
overseers
of his
genius. In particular. Miss Beston fulfilled the role of his lost nanny.
She was fiercely protective and controlled all access to him, taking in
the pens and the tape-recording machines at the door. She removed
his paintings from his studio while they were still wet to be exhibited
at the gallery in Bond Street, although he insisted that none should
be sold for three months in case he changed his mind about them.
Although sometimes there were half-a-dozen cUents queuing up to
take
a picture
at a million pounds
a canvas. Bacon would appear
after eighty days and reclaim
all his paintings. He only wanted to
retouch them, he would say. That was his usual code for destroying
them; but some dozen were stored away in a warehouse in Victoria.
This was to constitute the bulk of his estate and included another
bull-fighting triptych, which featured a man with a bandaged leg in
the
ring. Yet in
spite of all these
efforts
at control, there was no
question of ruHng such a fickle life that was now becoming imperial
as well as remaining intermittent.
The big guns of British criticism were wheeled out to
fire their
salutes for the second retrospective at the Tate Gallery. One of the
more waspish representatives of the art establishment and the good
friend of Sir Anthony Blunt of the Courtauld Institute, Brian Sewell,
argued
the
case
for placing Bacon among
the
great
painters
of
history.
Hockney
is a virtuoso playing to the
gallery. Bacon works in the
tradition
of a Renaissance
master, and
is
only
a
painter - no
etchings, lithographs, finished drawings or designs for the theatre.
His subjects are not pretty things for the drawing-room, and the
scale of his work suggests
that he makes no concessions to the
private patron.
He
deals with Renaissance themes of religious and temporal
power, authority, corruption, conflict and
lust, and has compiled
his own pantheon of superhuman images with which
to demon-
strate them. Titian turned to the great texts of classical mytholoy,
the New Testament, and
to
portraiture
to
express
the human

284
Francis Bacon
predicaments of an age riven by Reformation, counter-Reforma-
tion,
and
political
struggle.
Bacon
turns
to
popes,
presidents,
businessmen and the tormented nude to make comments on our
day - astute, perceptive and horrifying.
His
figures
are
often
caged;
the
effect can be
as
aloof and
remote as the appearance of a bland politician on the television
screen, but the same device can become a trap, with the occupant
screaming for release. He defines small spaces within his canvases,
setting a stage for the action as in a circus or a fashion photogra-
pher's studio, and what is beyond the bright light is irrelevant; the
creatures
performing
are
human,
but
they
often
have
animal
references in the way that they walk, or move, or squat, distorted
far beyond our ape relatives and into the world of the butchered
carcase.
Paired
figures
on
a
bed
are
not
seen
in
any
affectionate
contiguity, but in the attitudes of erotic violence; they stem from
photographs of footballers, boxers and w restlers, but Bacon brings
them close to hardcore pornography and then elevates them with
his vision and technique into an abstracted allegory on which he
makes a savage, shuddering, visceral comment.
He
is
the
master of the moving
multiple
image,
not by
the
intellectual
and
analytical
methods
of Cubism,
nor
the
near
caricatural
distortions
of Picasso - though
he
recognizes
their
power - nor by any obvious adaptation of the photography that he
acknowledges
as
his source
material. Within
a generalized and
recognisable silhouette that makes a bold and simple statement of
the pose or action, there are subsidiar\^ indications of movement
that may complement or run counter to
it
.
.
. any man who has
ever handled a brush, or has an empathic response to the action of
painting, must
find
in Bacon's
pictures an
astonishing mastery.
Among
post-Renaissance
artists
he
is
a
great
painter;
in
the
wilderness of post-war art he is the towering giant.
f
Lord Gowrie, who had been the Minister
for the Arts
as well
as
deriving from the same part of Ireland as Bacon, wrote a trenchant
tribute to him. Since the death of Picasso and more than any other
painter, Bacon had provided the age with the image of Ezra Pound's
accelerated grimace. He did not record the past and was the
least
narcissistic of artists. He used a present preoccupation or recollec-
tion to prompt any act of painting. He was a man of great but narrow
erudition, because he was impatient of anything less than master-

A Deep Ordered Chaos
285
pieces that he could use for his art. His bleak view of human life did
not stop
his
joy
in
it. He was good company and generous with
money, because he had been a husder and now had more than he
needed. 'Politically, he
is an old-fashioned aristocratic liberal with a
low threshold of boredom.' He thought the Right was the best of a
bad job, because
it interfered less than the idealism of the Left with
individual
liberty. The
British did not know what to make of this
'elegant, wealthy,
rather conservative gendeman who
paints such
scary pictures'.
Nevertheless, Bacon was the greatest living painter and the most
important British one since Turner. He shared the aloof intuition of
French romantics
like Baudelaire. He had the nihilism and gaiety
of certain eighteenth-century minds. Nature was threatening and
monotonous; noctambular urban life was his territory. Like Beckett,
Bacon was 'an artist of endgame'. He did not paint from life, except
from
his
face
in
a
mirror.
His
subjects were
a few
friends and
himself, recorded from snapshots and memory. Yet 'Bacon himself
looks very like a Francis Bacon'. In this respect, he was close to the
contemporary he admired, Alberto Giacometti. He was 'unique in
this century in his ability to render the indoor, overfed, alcohol-and-
tobacco-lined flesh of the average urban male. His painting
is how
most of us look.'
By
the
artist's
request,
the
catalogue
contained
no
notes
or
previous critical responses to the one-hundred-and-twenty-six of his
works that he chose for the retrospective to hang in thirteen galleries
of the
Tate. He wanted
the
visual shock on the viewer without
preparation. 'Painting is
its own language,' he told one interviewer,
'and when you
talk about
it,
it's an inferior translation.' This long
screening of his
life's work did not win over
all of his new critics.
Waldemar Januszczak discovered the notorious sequence of Cruci-
fixion triptychs
that dominated the middle of the show to be the
work of 'a significantiy lesser artist, a melodramatic pseudovisionary
prone, unfortunately, to sensationaUsm'. But the
six or seven trip-
tychs
near
the
end
of the show
took
the
spectator
quiedy and
honesdy into the painter's domestic existence and introduced the
close circle of his friends.

286
Francis Bacon
As a social observer, Bacon, like Lucian Freud, has done much to
turn the grim
facts of everyday
life into a convincing and heroic
subject for high art. As a painter of loneliness - not the screaming,
existential, theatrical variety, but the quiet, numbing, ordinary kind,
that saps your faith in life and impresses you with the emptiness of
the room you are sitting in - he
is,
I think, incomparable.
Bacon
even
agreed
to
take
two
representatives
from
The
Times
around
the
huge
exhibition. To
them,
his
ageless
bearing was
dwarfed by his remarkable owl's head - 'feathers puffed out chuffily,
eyes hooded and with an uncanny
ability to pursue and trap with
their roving gaze\ He discounted some of his
early pictures and
commented on others. Of the centre panel of his 'Sweeney Ago-
nistes', he said drily: 'This one warns you never to go into a sleeping
car
.
.
. Those two have been in Chicago but one of the people in the
committee didn't like the idea of the penis showing. That was that.'
The tenderness evident in the triptych of 1973 of George Dyer's
death was banished by the factual tone of Bacon's voice, saying
it
was a picture of a great friend who had committed suicide in Paris.
'And
I
suppose
in
so
far
as my
pictures
are
ever
any
kind
of
illustration, this comes as close as any to a kind of narrative.'
Referring
to
a
painting of 'Sand
Dune', he confirmed
that
it
was sprayed on and covered with dust from
his studio
floor. He
was surrounded with dust, which lasted for ever. 'Wherever
I
live
becomes appalling disorder at once. For some reason
I find
I can
work much easier with chaos around me.' The likeness of the self-
portraits to the living painter was
startling, and he also confirmed
that he was usually his only human model. 'Shaving in the mirror
every day, looking at oneself, doing one's hair or anything - you have
a very good idea.
I only do self-portraits when
I have no one else to
do.' He preferred
to paint the nude, and he answered those who
were offended by the
feeling of dead meat
in some of his works.
'People ask me why my pictures have
this
feeling of rawness and
mortality.
If you think of a nude,
if you think of amthing going on
around you, think how raw it all
is.'
As
an
inveterate
gambler,
Bacon must
have known
the
risks
attached to a second major retrospective at the Tate. He had taken

A Deep Ordered Chaos
287
the challenge, accepting that the chances were against him, and the
gamble paid off magnificendy. That was the opinion ofJohn Russell
Taylor, now the art critic of The Times. Although the viewer might
be
left like one of Pinter's heroes, asking, 'What have
I seen, the
scum or the essence?' the analogy with the playwright would not go
away. 'Their imaginative worlds are similarly haunted, their artistic
means
as meticulous,
the
ultimate sources of their inspiration
as
obscure - even, one suspects,
to themselves - and the climate of
violence which pervades their work is created or recreated with the
same total urbanity of expression, not a word or a brush-stroke too
many, nothing anywhere which is slapdash or arbitrary.'
To the critic, the terms of Bacon's vision were buried deep inside
the image. 'Out of them a terrible beauty
is born.' He was not so
much provocative
or perverse
as possessed. He had
a species of
telepathy with the spectator. His emotion dictated the quality of the
feelings of the viewer. He was one of the supreme colourists of the
century. He was the most painterly of painters. There was nothing
he
did not know about how
to
apply pigment
to canvas
for the
greatest of effects. He enlarged sensibilities in a way that no other
painter had been able to do since the first revolution of the Cubists.
Those who saw the show might hate every moment, but they would
not be quite the same again.
This second British retrospective was the apotheosis of Bacon's
art. He had always said that he was more appreciated and sold better
in France and in the United States of America; but now he had full
recognition in his homeland. Perhaps more sweet to him was to be
asked by the National Gallery to choose from
its masterpieces an
exhibition of fourteen works called The Artist's Eye. His choice cut
through period and style. The works were assessed on their qualities
as paintings. They were hung widely spaced to give the maximum
visual impact and to emphasise their singularity. They told no stories,
they were themselves.
On
the
first
wall,
there were
two
portraits
by Rembrandt
of
Margaretha de
Geer,
the
wife
of Jacob
Trip. The
massive
ruff
severed the head from the body
like
a butcher's
knife. Raphael's
painting of the Pope Julius II, which had inspired Velazquez to paint
Bacon's model.
Innocent X, had been
ignored
in
favour of that

288
Francis Bacon
painter's 'Rokeby Venus' or ^Toilet of Venus'. Bacon thought
it
a
most beautiful painting, although
it was only a marvellous thing to
look back on. Once it was there, he had to make more concentrations
of images, to cut down the conveyance and deliver the sensation.
He contrasted, however, the Velazquez Venus with the pastel of
Degas, 'Woman Drying Herself. He prized Degas for returning to
the observer 'thtfact of the subject as if he had never before seen a
woman's body as
it really
is'. He also was a great student of people
caught out in their private acts inside their own spaces and rooms.
He had taken from the past only and exacdy what he could use in
the present day. And his terrible and incisive artist's eye had remade
not only how the watcher saw the counterpoint of the centuries, but
the loneliness of the
little doings and sensations of the billions of
singular beings in their artificial confines on this planet.

Optimism about Nothing
Riches are for spending, and spending for honour and good
actions. Therefore extraordinary expense must be limited by
the worth of the occasion.
'Of Expense'
by Francis Bacon, Lord Verulam,
Viscount St. Albans
For a living artist, if fame is the spur, price is the seal of success. In
May 1987, one of Bacon's eight early popes from the collection of
the Belgian banker. Baron Lambert, sold at Christie's in New York
for more than a million pounds, while a portrait of 'George Dyer
Talking' fetched only a little less. Two years later. Bacon's triptych
of the
death
of Dyer on
the
lavatory
in
Paris was
sold by
the
American cartoonist Saul Steinberg through Sotheby's in New York
for nearly four miUion pounds, although a Jackson Pollock, 'Number
8, 1950' reached almost double that figure. And at Christie's again
in November
1989,
another one
of Bacon's
studies
for
a pope
reached £3,600,000. Although these proceeds did not find the artist,
they confirmed his reputation as the leading living British painter.
Indifferent to money itself, particularly now that it was available in
such large quantities. Bacon let Marlborough Fine Art fix the price
of his new paintings at about a million pounds apiece and went on
living as he always had in the chaos of his London studio or at Long
Melford with John Edwards or in Paris, where he frequently visited
his friends. Unfortunately and inevitably, the huge sums of money
now attached to his work and his name attracted both the greedy and

the jealous. Peter Langan kept on prodding Bacon to decorate his
Brasserie as Hockney had done, but Bacon would not, knowing very
well
that Langan got the
capital back from his restaurant
for the
value of the paintings which he was given and hung in
it. So Bacon
became more
exclusive
and
cautious,
saying
that
he
no
longer
respected the opinions of any
critic of his work,
particularly
'the
critics in England who loathe everything I do'.
John Richardson now followed Douglas Cooper in turning against
Bacon's
art. Writing a
definitive
life of Picasso himself in
several
volumes, Richardson thought that the ageing Bacon did not retain
the creativity and force that Picasso still had in his last years. Bacon's
work seemed
facile and
tired,
particularly
the
pictures with
the
newsprint on the bottom that seemed
a confession of a
failure to
communicate. 'A
lot of the time Francis was
right
to destroy his
canvases.' And Peter Fuller found that Bacon restated his established
themes: figures seated in front of crucified carcasses; disintegrative
portraits of himself and his friends, and images of lonely and naked
men at their private functions. His handling of forms, though not of
paint materials, was growing looser. He could no longer unite figure
and ground.
The only development was a movement away from reliance on the
photographic image towards a new element of mythic symbolism -
but
it
often
seemed
arbitrary,
even
absurd.
It was
as
if
the
Eumenides,
in forms
resembling pink
elephants, had
returned
to haunt
the
sordid
events
in
hotel rooms,
or
the
sphinx had
materialized amidst the used dressings of a casualty ward. Bacon
drew less upon his day-to-day life in the *sexual gymnasium' of the
modern
city; the references to the recognizable
circle of friends
diminished; those to Aeschylus and Ingres greatly increased. But,
although Bacon's painting was
greeted with
increasing
acclaim,
nothing reduced his relendess sense of surgical, but increasingly
meaningless, despair, of paint thinned not so much with turpentine,
as formaldehyde.
Fuller's condemnation of Bacon's later work contained that streak of
moralism which judged the subjects the artist painted as well as the
style of his Hfe. The critic had to share Bacon's view of humanity to

optimism about Nothing
29
1
accept him as a realist. He had used his expressive skills to denigrate
and to degrade. He presented one aspect of the human condition as
a necessary and universal truth. The fact that his w^orks w^ere more
highly valued than those of Graham Sutherland merely exposed the
values of those v^ho made such a choice. 'Bacon's
skills may justly
command our
admiration;
but
his
tendentious
vision demands
a
moral response, and
I beheve, a refusal.' If Bacon was possessed by
genius,
it was of a life-diminishing kind.
Such British censoriousness was anathema to Bacon's French and
American critics, who saw in his work the very human condition and
a necessary and universal truth, and even a terrible beauty. He could
not be judged, only received. Acceptance was all. As Robert Hughes
wrote, Bacon was perhaps 'the extreme voice of the misere des hotels^
the sense of being trapped within the city by unassuageable and once
almost unnameable
appetites
...
In
his work,
the image
of the
classical nude body is simply dismissed;
it becomes, instead, a two-
legged animal with various addictions: to sex, the needle, security, or
power.
All moral
relationships
are
erased from
the world of his
paintings. It is unified, instead, by the smeared documentary force of
certain key images clipped, as
it were, from the grainy stock of the
twentieth century and then edited abruptly together.'
This return to his early wish to paint the history of his century
along with
his autobiography was revealed by Bacon
in the most
remarkable
serial
picture
of
his
later
years.
In
his
'Triptych,
1986-87', Woodrow Wilson in his top hat and overcoat and spats
walks down a step from darkness. He has vainly brought peace in
the world into being at the Versailles Conference by creating the
League
of
Nations,
that
ineffectual
instrument
for
preventing
another world war. In the central panel, the circumcised figure
in
the cricket pads
sits, this time with the heavy handsome features of
George Dyer combined with John Edwards, and raw life leaks in a
pink sensual shadow onto the black raised rostrum at his
feet. But
on the right panel,
a bloodstained sheet with a hole in
it covers a
writing-desk, held down by a desk-lamp and meaningless newsprint.
The president of the United States holding under his arm his useless
treaty that leads only to violence,
is poised against the murder of
Trotsky at his desk by a Russian assassin with an ice-pick; these two

292
Francis Bacon
wings contain the
truth of the
fact - animal
love
set
against the
nothing of death.
In another triptych of the previous two years, a 'Study for Self-
Portrait', Bacon showed
himself self-contained,
but beleaguered.
His hands clasp his knees or the top of his stool-chair. A red arrow
points to his loose and suffering mouth. White circles ring his neck
and lower jaw, while the
left side of the skull spatters and smears
away in doubt. He seems almost ready to pity himself as his
feet
move restiessly about. There
is a quality of isolation and introspec-
tion that is absent from all of his other self-portraits. He had done a
number of them, not because he liked his face. As he said, he hated
it, but there was nobody else to do at the time. He was more lonely
now and self-absorbed, and
if, in his own words, the subject was the
bait, he had swallowed his own hook and gaffed the fact of who he
was.
Two other triptychs of the succeeding years proved his detractors
wrong and demonstrated the old master at the height of his assurance
and his powers. 'Triptych, 1987' shows on the left an orifice and a
wound ringed by a blue circle within human loins and bandaged ribs
on an operating table; centrally, great thrusting legs with plasters on
walk through an open doorway, exposing a penis and
a bleeding
aperture; on
the
right,
a
bull's head
strikes downwards with
his
horns, while a Fury imitates the beast below with flying prongs. This
mythical and
sexual dream sequence was
followed
in
1988 by
a
'Second
Version
of Triptych,
1944', which
the
artist ended
by
presenting to the Tate Gallery. At six feet high and almost fifteen
feet
long,
it was more
than
twice
the
size
of the
original. The
significant word 'Crucifixion' was omitted from this explicit psycho-
sexual sequel. la
it, the left of the three Eumenides
still sweeps on
with double hunch-back, but placed against a murky crimson ground,
not a blood-orange one; in the middle, the blindfolded screaming
head, descending from a pregnant belly and buttocks on its stand,
is
isolated on its callipers above a dull red dais put against a sandy wall;
and on the right, the howling head
is shifted to the edge and set on
a table top, as
if the bestial protest against the bloodiness of it
all
were more marginal in the sensation of a life going down.
Certainly,
the rawness and spewing of the younger
triptych of

optimism about Nothing
293
forty-four years before this other version was denied in the spacing
and
the
distance of an
old man's
feeling. The neon of the
first
became the damask of the second, as if the same glare of vision v^ere
now a closing of eyelids or a drawing down of blinds. The earlier
picture was painted in oil and pastel with paint brushed and smeared
and scratched on, while the background of the
later one was dark
maroon and black thinned with turpentine and sometimes sprayed,
so that all attention was focused on the figures of the Furies. To one
critic, these three pictures could no longer be viewed in a classical
or Christian context. The creatures in them represented the state of
mankind at birth when the new-born infant blindly experienced
all
sensation through the ears, mouth and anus. The blindfold, the gag
and the woman's torn clothing turned them from timeless archetypes
to sado-masochistic fantasies.
They symbolize a state of being whereby, in order to feel anything
at
all, victims willingly offer their bodies to be violated, dismem-
bered and killed. Every altered detail of the new canvas serves to
stress physical suffering. Bacon eroticizes pain and seems to deny
that such
a
thing
as
the human
spirit
exists.
Life
is
physical
suffering,
fear
and
death
.
.
.
There
is
something
here more
deliberate, more chosen and more willed than despair. Something
vicious and purely evil.
On hearing of this. Bacon merely said, ^Really,
I thought they were
rather nice, myself
Bacon did not admit to being so haunted by the Furies in his age
as he was in his youth. Yes, all men had a sense of guilt at times, but
in his late seventies, he was *not very much haunted with guilt these
days'. He remained fond of Aeschylus because reading the plays still
brought up exciting images to his mind, the violence and the gore.
When accused of painting merely to shock, he would reply that what
was called Surrealism had gone through
art
at
all times, and ask,
'What is more surreal than Aeschylus.^' He even read aloud from the
Oresteia on television:
Over the wide rolling earth, we've ranged in flock,
Hurdling the waves and wingless flight, and now we come

294
Francis Bacon
All hot pursuit, outracing ships astern.
And now he's here somewhere cowering like a hare.
The reek of human blood,
it's laughter to my heart.
Of all the pictures of this late period, the simplest had the greatest
effect, certainly in Paris. 'Blood on the Floor' of 1986 was the most
arresting painting at Bacon's triumphant show of fourteen paintings
at the Galerie Lelong in Paris the next year. Only three of them were
not presold:
a triptych was on offer for £2,400,000 and two single
canvases for /j850,ooo each. The reviewer for the Sunday Times was
struck by
the
pin-striped and
jaunty Dorian Gray
figure
of the
painter, surrounded by admirers and telling of his love of France,
where he was truly appreciated. The sensation of viewing 'Blood on
the
Floor' was
similar
to
receiving an
electric
shock. The blood
spattered on the grey and orange cell looked as if it had burst from a
wound with the barest of devices and no human figure. Bacon had
created
'the
most
disturbing
narrative
of human
anguish
with
masterful understatement and ambiguity'. Yet he would not explain
his work, saying:
I don't know how that painting came about.
I think
I just dropped
some paint on the floor and thought I'd draw blood on the floor.
It's just
.
.
. well, it's just blood on the floor.
I never think of my work except in terms of images and
I have
never thought of it as violent.
I just think of myself as
a
realist.
Painting
is not a thing you talk about.
It is
its own language.
I've
just always painted to excite myself. There is no explanation.
Never complain, never
explain.
Increasingly, Bacon
lived
the
old
French adage. H^ Anglo-Irish upbringing as a gentleman prevented
him from complaining, while his dedication to his own method and
his unconscious vision
as an
artist stopped him from
explaining.
More gnomic and set in his utterances year by year, he watched his
worth
rise and his reputation spread. The same year as the
Paris
show, the Marlborough Gallery of New York also put on a successful
exhibition in that metropolis while Galerie Beyeler at Basle mounted
a retrospective of his works. Another eight of his paintings travelled
in a show named 'British Art in the Twentieth Century' from the

optimism about Nothing
295
Royal Academy in London to the Staatsgalerie of Stuttgart, while yet
eight more of his pictures wandered in 'A School of London' from
the Kunsternernes Hus of Oslo through Humblebak and Dusseldorf
and on to Venice. Yet the apogee of this international fame - and
almost a harbinger for the end of the Cold War and a proof that
Gorbachev's policy of perestroika was meaningful - was his invitation
to hold a restrospective in Moscow, a city that had never seen so
personal and visceral an art.
If chance played
a part
in creating Bacon's work, so
it did
in
putting on his show in Russia. The young James Birch, who ran the
Birch and Conran Gallery up Dean Street from the Colony Room,
went to Moscow to try to have his own artists represented there, only
to
find out how many Soviet
artists appreciated the paintings of
Bacon. He also made the acquaintance of a Soviet diplomat, Sergei
Klokov, who had exceptional contacts in
artistic circles and
really
wanted
to meet Bacon.
'But
I
can't propose
this
or
I'll end
in
Siberia,' he told the Soho gallery owner, 'so you must propose
it to
me. But if Mr Bacon comes to Moscow, I'm sure the queues will be
bigger than those for Lenin's tomb.'
On his return to London, Birch approached Bacon in the Colony
Room and asked him whether he would like a Russian exhibition.
At dinner
later
that
night. Bacon gave
the
art dealer
his
private
telephone number and confirmed in the morning that he was
still
interested. So Birch telephoned Klokov and rounded off the nego-
tiations by
giving the
Soviet diplomat
oysters and champagne
in
Wilson's fish restaurant in Jermyn Street. After that, the details were
passed over to Marlborough Fine Art and the British Council and
the Union of Soviet Artists, which issued a formal invitation. Since
Turner, no
British
artist had been
so honoured, and
except
for
Chagall, who
had
been
born
in
Russia,
Bacon
had
beaten
all
contemporary European and American painters
to the New Tre-
tyakov Building on Gorky
Park. His
selection caused
a reported
outcry
from
the
Prime
Minister,
Margaret
Thatcher,
'Not
that
dreadful man who paints those horrible pictures.'
The
artist
lost a
little of his enthusiasm
for the Moscow show
because some of his more
explicit paintings were excluded.
'His
most important work in the permanent collection is his central panel

296
Francis Bacon
of buggers/ David Sylvester told a reporter. 'They've censored
it.
I
feel the British Council quite righdy toes the
line because
it's not
like sending a cricket team to Russia,
is
it.'" If Bacon's excitement
waned with this censorship, he did not protest too much. He refused
to go to Moscow and nominated John Edwards in his place, an ironic
gesture of sending a proletarian to the home of socialist 'realism',
especially as his nude of Edwards had been banned from the show
as 'pornographic', although the poster was his portrait of Edwards.
'The main reason
he's
not going
there',
Sylvester continued,
'is
because he's had terrible asthma recendy. Terrible' Bacon reiterated
that
his bloody asthma had
stopped him
leaving. He had been
looking forward to
it. 'Everything was closed up after 191 7.
It would
have been fascinating to see the country now.'
Moscow's loss was my gain. Because he did not go, he sprang into
my longest meeting with him to talk over the culture of the
'forties.
He was not suffering from asthma
at
all, only the
thirst for more
champagne. He gave me the catalogue of the Moscow Exhibition,
complaining of the censorship there and the refusal of Lucian Freud
to lend his picture of two men copulating, even though it would have
been banned. He read
for me his
letter to Russia, printed
as the
frontispiece of the catalogue:
It is a great honour to be invited to have an exhibition of paintings
in Moscow.
When
I was young,
I feel
I was very much helped towards my
painting
after
I saw
Eisenstein's
films
Strike and
The Battleship
Potemkin by their remarkable visual imagery.
In one of Van Gogh's letters he makes this statement: 'How to
achieve such anomalies such alterations and refashionings of realitv'
that what come^ out of it are lies if you like but lies that are more
true than literal truth.'
Francis Bacon
London 4/6/88
There were long queues in Moscow to see the exhibition, and they
began to form nine hours before the opening. Bacon had said that
he did not know what the Russian reaction would be. 'All
I know is

optimism about Nothing
297
that my
pictures
are some
of the most
disliked among modern
paintings.
I have no idea what the Russians will make of them.' At
the ceremony before the event, considerable diplomatic finesse was
displayed by Lord Gowrie and Comrade Salakhov of the Union of
Artists. The issue of Bacon's homosexuality was raised by a couple
of British journalists, who asked how it related to the Soviet criminal
code, which made that male act punishable by five years in a labour
camp. Gowrie
replied
that
there had
not been, nor could
there
have been, any discreet censorship of Bacon's pictures in Moscow,
since homosexuality was never an avert subject in Bacon's painting.
Salakhov followed this delicate mouthwork with the suggestion that
times were changing in this area, as in so many areas of Russian Ufe,
and that certain laws were long due for review. Indeed, that was why
the Bacon show was happening. It was important now to see the real
thing. In Soviet art since the Revolution, much had been hidden or
suppressed and now was being reassessed and put on show.
It was
the period when 'we must fill in the white spaces'.
In fact. Bacon's subversive message at his Moscow show was not
for homosexual rights, but a political protest. The right-hand panel
of his 'Triptych' of 1986-87 suggested the killing of Trotsky at his
desk by an assassin sent by Stalin, and some of the Russian audience
understood what they were seeing.
It was taken from a photograph
of the victim's study in Mexico City, but it was not mentioned in the
title, thus foxing the authorities. 'The subject
is
still virtually taboo
in the Soviet Union,' The Times correspondent noted:
But Soviet gallery-goers who recognize
this image may begin to
see doors opening upon their country's deeply troubled past, as
well. That Bacon's work can carry these potent significations is an
added reward.
To
the
Soviets,
this
exhibition comes
at
an
extraordinarily
significant moment. Deprived of the literature and art of Western
European existentialism for some forty years, they are now, by all
accounts, beginning to recognize
feelings of alienation
in them-
selves - from authority and from the state, particularly - and from
the
still excessive bureaucracy that dominates Soviet
life
for the
majority. They may not go wholeheartedly for Bacon's elaborate
fascination
with wounded
and
crippled
flesh,
but
the show
is

298
Francis Bacon
almost certain to spark off debate about the validity as well as the
limitations of Bacon's isolationist posture.
One-hundred-and-fifty-thousand people visited the exhibition in six
weeks, and they
left the Visitors' Book peppered with
their com-
ments. An architect wrote that these were the work of the
devil, a
war veteran supposed that Bacon suffered from severe concussion of
the
brain,
a doctor diagnosed him
as psychologically traumatised.
Other comrades called him a charlatan and an idiot, and they found
his work disgusting and sick and repulsive.
It was as if one were put
through a mincer in a butcher's shop.
Still others hailed a genius
and an artist of the future and a feast of absurdity, while the more
daring observers saw
a warning against totalitarianism and Com-
munism
itself. The wisest and the saddest comment came from an
actress: 'Excuse us, but throughout the period of Soviet power we
have been fed with a different kind of art. We have been deprived of
inner freedom, perception, thought and feelings. And a great deal of
time will yet have to pass before we are capable of taking in Bacon's
art.'
The English
critic Brian Sewell was right about Russians under
perestroika leaning over backwards not to condemn Bacon's pictures
as
further
evidence
of the
decadence
of Western
society*.
'The
problem will be that they won't find anything they can attach to their
own
tradition.
There's no
painting
in
Russia which
in
any way
resembles Bacon's work.' The truth is that there was no painting in
the world which resembled Bacon's work, which might borrow from
tradition, but transmuted
it to inspiration. The less he explained, the
more the viewers and critics read into him. And in the diversity of
their opinions, his^ originality became more marked.
Something of the acclaim of Bacon could be deduced from the
extraordinary theft of his portrait by Lucian Freud from the National
Gallery in West Berlin while on loan from the Tate. The meticulous
painting showing Bacon
with
lidded
eyes
and
sour mouth was
evidence
of
the
long
link
between
Britain's
two
leading
living
painters, and thieves demanded a ransom of one million pounds for
it,
after they were unable
to fence
it within the underworld of art
because of its notoriety. Eventually, the ransom was not paid, and

optimism about Nothing
299
the picture was never recovered. The only consequence of the theft
was the early closure of the travelling British Council exhibition in
Germany.
Bacon's awareness of his own inevitable death extended to others.
Sitting in Mario's in Chelsea with John Edwards, he saw a friend
enter, the art dealer Robert Fraser who was dissected, the blotches
on his face and his emaciation understood.
^It's AIDS,' Bacon told
Barry Joule next morning, voicing the fear of the disease that scared
the homosexual community of London. Four months
later, Fraser
was gone, and the three companions and prophets of his end held a
quiet wake for him in the Colony Room. Most of Bacon's contem-
poraries were dead now, many of them of drink, and even Bacon
admitted to part of the process of growing old.
*I mean', he said, 'life
becomes more of a desert,
in a sense, around you.' He had even
failed
to
ask
most
of the
Colony Room
crowd
to
his
second
retrospective at the Tate, telling Joule, Tm not having too many of
those crooks there.'
His way of life and continuous drinking of champagne could not
deny age and time forever. Even Dorian Gray succumbed at the end
of Oscar Wilde's tale. Just after his eightieth birthday, the artist was
taken to hospital for a kidney operation. Few of his friends expected
him to survive
it. As
it was, his strong body and his resilience saw
him back in Soho and his studio within a few weeks. He celebrated
the end of his eighth decade by having no celebrations and failing to
turn out for a party in his honour at Marlborough Fine Art. Although
Lucian Freud had accepted
to become
a Companion of Honour,
Bacon
still
refused
all
awards,
saying
that
he
would
then
be
'cordoned off from existence'. He did not even know what to do with
all the flowers sent round to Reece Mews. Among the pyramids of
squeezed tubes and rags and paint tins on his floor, he had nothing
to put the blooms in. Tm not the sort of person', he said 'who has
vases\
To his interviewers and well-wishers, Bacon's responses became
more and more stock and predictable. His usual remark about the
meaning of his pictures was the dismissive epigram, 'If you can talk
about
it, why paint
it.^' Or he would say of his work, 'You can't be
more horrific than
life
itself.' One young reporter from The Times

300
Francis Bacon
who had
just seen the
film Batman before seeing Bacon
in Reece
Mews, noted that the only painting
in Gotham
City's Flugelheim
Museum
that the Joker prevented
his henchmen from destroying
was a Bacon; the reporter then visited the Constables in the Victoria
and
Albert Museum
with
Bacon,
to
hear him
praise
the
older
master's
free
style and tremendous spontaneity, and
deliver
a
set
piece about his methods:
I know that in my own work the best things are the things that just
happened - images that were suddenly caught and that
I hadn't
anticipated. We don't know what the unconscious
is, but every so
often something wells up in us.
It sounds pompous nowadays to
talk about the unconscious, so maybe
it's better to say 'chance'.
I
believe in a deeply ordered chaos and in the rules of chance.
I have
to hope that my instincts will do the right thing because
I can't
erase what
I have done. And
if
I drew something
first, then my
paintings would be illustrations of drawings.
The interview ended as others had over bottles of champagne in the
Colony Room, where Bacon concluded
it with his favourite
obiter
dicta,
'I am an optimist, but about nothing.
It's just my nature to be
optimistic. We
live, we
die and
that's
it,
don't you
think.^' This
careful show of bleak hedonism was
exactly the
last portrait
that
Bacon wished to speak of himself, when a painting would not do. He
was constructing a consistent persona,
irrespective of his wayward
beginnings. And
this desire to dictate the presentation of his past
and to delete the inappropriate explained his strange treatment of an
old friend's 'scrap hook\ About Francis Bacon.
Bruce Bernard had conceived an illustrated book on the painter,
designed in a square format to show the triptychs across two pages,
and illustrated by personal photographs as well as paintings, while
the bulk of the text would be leading reviews of Bacon's works and
some personal comments on them by Bernard himself. The painter
and Marlborough Fine Art were enthusiastic about the project, and
the many dinners with the
artist were convivial. All went well until
Bernard submitted
his personal opinions on some of the pictures
and Bacon asked for a few small changes, striking out words such as
'incarnation'. He even approved the lay-outs, but suddenly jibbed at

Optimism about Nothing
3 o i
the rough colour proofs, which were inaccurate and confirmed his
misgivings for the project. Now he insisted on the removal of the
personal photographs and Bernard's own comments and the repro-
duction of any of his paintings before his first Tate triptych. Bernard
and his publishers would not accept the alterations and About Francis
Bacon
still
has
not appeared
in
print.
'Friendly agreements
are',
Bernard wrote ruefully, 'by their nature vulnerable'.
In private, Bernard was more bitter on the subject of the about-
turn of the
artist. He said that at the end of his
life. Bacon could
round on any friend and deny anything he had said which deviated
from his public image. 'Never heard of him,' he would say. 'Never
met him. What he says on me
is Ues.' He wanted
all deleted from
Bernard's book on his relationship with Eric Hall, and he declared
that he had
not painted
a gouache of 1929
found by Bernard,
although
it was signed by him. Like many another genius come into
their greatness and their glory, at the end of his days. Bacon wanted
to dominate and destroy his past in the way that he
still dominated
paint by his rules of chance and destroyed his early canvases and his
failed ones. The problem was that evidence and memory and history
could not be hacked apart by a kitchen knife. He could not make up
an autobiography from the lucid and brilliant philosophy of painting
and living, which he had learned in part from his French friends and
critics of late. He could not deeply order the chaos of yesteryear.
'He was a wicked man in his greatness,' Patrick Procktor said of
him. 'He could not bear that other people could draw or paint. At
the end of his Hfe, he became so particular that he didn't think there
was anyone of any talent in the world
at
all.' He was alone on his
pinnacle. Nobody could challenge him in his old age. It was the final
vanity of the
soon-to-die,
the
revenge
of a man who had been
rejected and outlawed and poor until his late middle years. He used
to ask Procktor who he thought was any good as a painter. To tease
him, Procktor would think of obscure artists and reply, 'What about
Francis Rose or Stephen Tennant.^' And Bacon would answer, 'Oh,
I don't like her.'
The past that Bacon wished to preserve he had put into photo-
graphs. In 1988, he went to an exhibition by William Burroughs in
the October Gallery
in London. There the two old
friends from

302
Francis Bacon
Tangier were photographed by John Minihan, who had recorded
Bacon wearing a shiny black mackintosh in Paris in 1977 during a
show of his art at the Galerie Claude Bernard, and now caught him,
holding up the
frail Burroughs and looking with desperate concern
at the desiccated writer lighting a cigarette and staggering forward.
Neither of them was shown with Beckett, reclusive to the last, ascetic
and alone in these rare pictures of which the photographer quoted
George Bernard Shaw with approval, 'If you cannot see at a glance
that the old game
is up, that the camera has hopelessly beaten the
pencil and paint brush as an instrument of artistic representation,
then you will never make a true critic, you are only, like most critics,
a picture fancier.'
Bacon was, of course, a photograph fancier, but he never thought
it capable, more than paint, of artistic representation. He was also a
fancier of the written word, and Beckett was one of the writers he
particularly admired along with
Pinter. As Sam Hunter wrote
in
his
incisive essay for the catalogue of Bacon's major retrospective
exhibition in Washington D.C. in late 1989:
Like those severe but tonic writers, Bacon feels his art represents
the simple unalloyed truth of existence as he perceives it, no matter
how hard to bear that reality may be. For him, the philosophical
Existentialists and their literary followers set the tone with their
perception that the basic problems of existence were loneUness,
the impenetrable mystery of the
universe, and
death.
Basically,
Bacon believes in a form of the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche's
nihilism and certainly, too, in the aspect of the Greek ideal that
Nietzsche so enthusiastically endorsed, the Dionysian conquest of
pessimism through art.
f
The Washington retrospective at the Hirschhorn Museum and Sculp-
ture Garden
at the Smithsonian Institute followed an exhibition at
the Marlborough Gallery in Tokyo, which saw Bacon break into the
Japanese market and begin to become exceedingly rich. In America,
his reputation was at its height, and the retrospective travelled during
1990
to
the County Museum
of Los
Angeles
and
then
to
the
Museum of Modern Art in New York. His critics particularly praised
his studies for self-portraits and of John Edwards. His triptych of

himself of 1985-86 showed a new manner in him, an awkwardness
in
gratuitiously demeaning
poses, somewhat
derived
from Muy-
bridge's photograph, 'Man Performing Standing Broad Jump'. This
humiliating
view
of himself contrasted
with
Edwards who was
depicted as a heroic male nude in the tradition of the Elgin Marbles
and the Italian Renaissance. The flesh appeared both ghoulish and
strangely beautiful, swallowed by a vaguely sinister panel of black:
Over the years Bacon has proved himself a voluptuary of the flesh,
like Rubens, Watteau, or Soutine in their distinctiy different ways,
and in his later years, he seems most like the aging Rembrandt.
Flesh
is for him the essential material of being and things,
life's
basic substance. Paint becomes flesh in its colour, texture, material
density, and fluidity - and a vehicle that serves desire and rekindles
his historical and personal memory, allowing him to discover the
physical and spiritual particularity of a specific person ... In 'Study
for
Portrait of John Edwards' Bacon compresses
his
figure
of
Edwards into a kind of iridescent pigment skin where paint and
depicted body gloriously fuse, pushing his warped figuration to a
point near dissolution, not unlike the gorgeous sunsets of Monet
that he
tried
to emulate
in
his disturbing early paintings of the
papal scream.
Ever the wily magician in his manipulation of paint. Bacon has
lost none of his touch or invention with the years. In his recent
work he continues
to
bait the
'trap'
for capturing the
distilled
essence of reality, salvaging the mysterious
living image of man
from the
ruins of time,
as the great paintings of the past have
done
.
.
.
Although he had objected to the word 'incarnation' applied to one of
his paintings. Bacon had achieved the incarnation of John Edwards
and had salvaged that particular man from the ruins of time. Both
during the rest of the artist's Hfe and after it, Edwards would receive
glory and riches, unlimited by the worth of the occasion.

A Homecoming
Wisdom for a man's self is, in many branches thereof, a
depraved thing. It is the wisdom of rats, that will be sure to
leave a house somewhat before it fall.
It is the wisdom of the
fox, that thrusts out the badger, who digged and made room
for him.
It is the wisdom of crocodiles, that shed tears when
they would devour.
'Of Wisdom for a Man's Self,
by Francis Bacon, Lord Verulam,
Viscount St. Albans
Bacon was not wise for himself. He was a passionate and reckless
man, who declared that he painted and lived by sensation. But many
of those who
still remained close to him were wise for themselves
and knew that they could
rely on the legendary generosity of the
aged artist, who hardly spent his millions on himself, but on his court
of friends and those he loved. He was lavish with his suitors.
At one
time he had admired
the
plays of Harold
Pinter, and
particularly The Homecoming.
It
tells of a brother who has
left the
East End of London, but who returns one night with a wife, Ruth.
The East End family decide to include her with all the understated
menace that also broods over the work of the artist. The hard one,
Lenny, speaks
to her of his past
like
Eliot's Sweeney or Bacon's
'Sweeney Agonistes': 'The facts being what they were, so
I clumped
her one.
It was on my mind
at the time to do away with her, you
know, to
kill her, and the
fact
is, that as killings go,
it would have
been a simple matter, nothing to
it.' He quickly finds out that Ruth
is of the same metal and temper as he is, and he sets her up as a tart

3o6
Francis Bacon
to subsidise and service the whole male
family. As the old
father
says, 'You're kin. You're kith. You belong here.'
Bacon's homecoming to Cavendish Hall and neighbouring Long
Melford
w^as with
his
freshly-acquired
East End
family through
John Edwards, who was one of six children. The Edwards brothers
had
added
to
their
string
of pubs
in
East London
with more
property and pubs
in
Suffolk.
In Long Melford,
they
lived near
Bacon's
first
cousin,
Pamela
Firth
Matthews,
in
her
Georgian
stately home with
its
lavish and beautiful gardens,
so reminiscent
of the
great houses of the
Ireland of the
artist's youth. Whether
Bacon wished for a meeting of minds between his old world and his
new one, or whether his sense of irony demanded a confrontation
were
questions
not
to be
solved by the
time
of his
death. The
Edwards clan with their near friend, the
Irish dealer
in antiques,
John Tanner, acquired Westgate House, another Georgian mansion
with
extensive
converted
stables, and
Dale's Farm,
a barricaded
house with many outbuildings, surrounded by gates and walls and
signs
of: GUARD DOGS - WARNING. The valuables inside the
farmhouse beside a disused aerodrome warranted a great measure
of protection.
One merchant banker, who went to dinner at an Edwards property
in the village, found himself seated with eight other outside guests
and two women at table. Four of the visitors referred to a larcenous
past; but the food and the wine were excellent. The rooms of the
house were superbly decorated, but the banker was
told
that the
old furniture and the pictures were often changed. They went in
and
out,
a passing show. The constant
factor was
the numerous
paintings by Francis Bacon, which were then hung in the lavatories.
The untold worth of these pictures
explained
the need
for
tight
security.
Some of the old landowners and villagers in this part of Suffolk
were alarmed by this incursion. There was
little effort by the East
Enders to fraternise, only to dominate.
It culminated in the extreme
mortification of Pamela Firth Matthews.
Occasionally, during the
summer, she opened the gardens of Cavendish Hall to the public.
The
last
time
that
she
met
her
cousin
Francis
Bacon
before
his
death,
a Bendey
cruised down
the
drive and
disgorged
the

Edwards brothers and the
artist. They supported him across the
lawn and
sat him down under an old
tree, where he had played
as a child with his cousin Pamela. When she left her other visitors
to greet Francis, she found him paralytic with drink and incapable
of speech. She
looked
at
the
smiling Edwards
family and
said,
*Drive him home.' His home was no longer hers at Cavendish Hall.
In
this encounter between
the
old and
the new,
she
felt deeply
wounded and ashamed and sad, particularly as she would never see
him again.
It was rare for Bacon not to be in control of his
life. Even in his
eighties, he was not capable of being pressured or blackmailed. He
simply walked elsewhere. But in this case, he had brought his fresh
Cockney family to the scene of his youth. He might well have agreed
with E.M. Forster's dictum: ONLY CONNECT. Yet he would have
countered
it with: ONLY REVERT. Between new connections and
reversions, his life did lie. The disaster and the pleasure lay in trying
to mix them. And
finally, he could never revert, once he had gone
away. He could not mix the elegant with the raffish and the formal
with the unconventional, especially in Suffolk, where his homecom-
ing turned out to be most unwise for himself.
The Edwards ascendancy at Long Melford, which had overtaken
the Anglo-Irish one, could only be answered by flight to France and
then to Spain. There Bacon discovered a last love in Madrid, the
city which his master Velazquez had glorified in paint, and where he
would
die. His wish was that his lover,
a Spanish banker, was
to
remain anonymous, and
it should be respected. But although his
recurrent illnesses brought him down again and again in the last two
years of his Ufe, he did achieve that final and transient passion, which
he had pursued in his desperate search for the fact and the sensation.
A week before his death, he said that he was becoming progressively
happier,
and
that he wished
to
die
while
enjoying himself He
repeated his feelings in Soho to an old friend, Sandy Fawkes. 'He
once told me the only cure
for a hangover was suicide. When he
died he was in love again.'
'My mother made me promise never to grow old,' Bacon used to
say, 'and now
I know what she means.' All his friends worried about
him falling down the cabin stairs at Reece Mews and breaking a hip

3o8
Francis Bacon
or his neck. Yet he never did, although he succumbed to hepatitis
and
three
bouts
of pneumonia
in
a
year. Once
his
friend
and
neighbour, Barry Joule, found him as good as dead, while checking
up on him in his studio. He was unable to breathe with aggravated
asthma and had
to be sent to hospital again. He was given heavy
medication and despite his doctor's orders, he decided to travel to
the mountains
of Spain, where
the
air was meant
to be
better,
although he had always thrived on London grime.
In an
act of prodigality and
after
the example of Turner and
Henry Moore, Bacon gave his 'Second Version of the Triptych of
1944'
to the Tate Gallery, which had already been given the
first
version by Eric Hall.
It was worth three million pounds, but Bacon
wanted the two to hang side by side so that the comparison could be
made. He had only painted the second one because the
first had
been too fragile to travel to his Washington retrospective, and he had
always wanted to paint a larger version of the subject.
'I thought
it
might work,' he
said,
'but
I think the
first one
is the
best.' The
second version had been presented to the Tate at the instigation of
Gilbert de Botton, then a Trustee of the Gallery. When Bacon had
lent
it to the institution, de Botton had told him that
it would be a
shame if the work ended in private hands abroad. Tour rethinking
on that theme was wonderful, and you would be giving that gift of
comparison
in perpetuity
to
the
nation.'
In
his gendemanly way,
Bacon had
replied,
'Oh,
I
don't think
they'd be
interested.' De
Botton knew
the
artist's
style and
replied
quite
casually,
'Quite
possibly. But if I probed this, would you be willing to give
it.^' Bacon
said he would,
but de
Botton knew
his
habit of having second
thoughts. And indeed, after a time. Bacon said that he could not do
it. There was a problem with
gift taxes. De Botton
let more time
pass and asked Bacon
if that was the only problem. Bacon replied
that
it was. Meanwhile, the Director of the Tate Gallery sorted out
the matter with the Treasury, and Bacon did make the
gift a few
months before he died.
'It was a remarkable exercise in generosity,'
de Botton said, 'but
I had no idea
it was a race against time.
I could
have delayed more, and then
it would have been lost.'
Bacon was doing
litde now,
although he
did
plan
a
series of
paintings about places where murder had been committed, 'one in a

A Homecoming
309
field, one on a pavement, and one in a room'. He abandoned the
project and finished his
last picture before the Christmas of 199 1.
He knew and did not want to know mortality was soon coming to
pay a final call. He was such a legend that he was already thought to
be dead. The Observer Magazine even called him at Reece Mews to
ask if he had passed away. He answered the telephone to say that he
was 'sorry not to be able to help on this occasion'. Given the fact of
death, even life was a better alternative. In one of his last interviews
with Richard Cork in his studio, he admitted that he had had his
life-mask taken, although he bitterly regretted the experience once
his face was smothered with plaster.
*I hate the thought of death,' he
said.
'I hate the thought of it all coming to an end.' Then he cried
out, 'Shall we have some champagne.^'
He had daily been aware of death.
It was just around the corner
all the time. When
it came, there was no escape. This was why he
was so glad to wake at all each morning that he did. He had known
many people die or commit suicide, but he had never thought they
were anything but dead.
'I am certain there's nothing after that, and
I like the finality of the American expression "drop dead"'. Although
reality was pain and horror which was the daily bread of newspaper
and television, death could be confronted by
art, as the Egyptians
had done. They had attempted to defeat
it by leaving images, as he
was trying to do.
Yet his images were immediate, for this life, now. He loathed the
idea of a museum
like the Tate giving a whole gallery to his past
painting.
In
a swipe
at Henry Moore, he
said
that he found
'the
profound vanity of these old men who try to immortalize themselves
through foundations very boring'. He would leave his money where
he pleased, even
if it were scattered to the winds. 'Nothing would
give me greater horror than to allow a vain old man to perpetuate
himself in dead art.'
He wanted no record of himself except what people chose to read
into
his surviving paintings. When Lord Gowrie pointed out that
somebody would write his
life anyway, he replied, 'Yes, but
I shall
be dead and
I shan't have helped and
I shan't care.' Only the second
statement was
wishful, because
he
talked
extensively
to
possible
biographers, and his interviews and his pictures were highly articu-

310
Francis Bacon
late. He had even made no secret of his homosexuaUty in the
last
decades of his
life, actually signing a protest against Clause 28 of a
Conservative
bill to discourage homosexual propaganda despite his
dislike of gay militance.
'I don't go about shouting that I'm gay,' he
told Richard Cork,
'but AIDS
has made
it
all much
w^orse, you
know.'
People were
very odd
about
it. When he had
offered
a
telephone engineer a drink in his studio, he had received a strange
look and the query, 'You're gay, aren't you.^' before the man would
touch the glass.
Certainly, he was a dandy in the manner of Baudelaire's 'cult of
the self. As John McEwan recalled of his meetings with Bacon:
This Byronic
aspect
to
his nature had something
to do with
a
complete absence of sentimentality, a recklessness, a bleak ration-
ality, an awareness
that
his
lack of religious
faith was
in
itself
despair and also an intense animalism.
The animalism was the
first thing one
felt on meeting him,
a
palpable magnetic field. It gave one some inkling of what he meant
when he rather mystifyingly described his art as trying to record
his feelings about things as closely to his 'own nervous system' as
he
could. He wanted
to conduct
this nervous
energy
into
his
painting, to vent its expressive power.
On one occasion I was standing close behind him when an artist
he disliked entered the room. Immediately he stiffened, brisded,
became alert as a dog.
It was the only time
I have witnessed the
hairs stand up on the back of a human neck. No fight ensued, or
hostile conversation. It was more menacing than that. As a younger
man he must have been capable of being quite terrifying
.
.
.
In older age he defiantly wore tight trousers, the better to show
off his figure. He was dapper and had settied on a late nineteen-
fifties 'mod'
tas;te for leather jackets and pastel slip-on shoes. His
face was soft and pink and he was shamelessly vain, admiring him-
self in the nearest mirror and combing his hair even when carrying
on a conversation. He was made for an age of blades and beaux.
Bacon as the dandy and heir of Baudelaire was also stressed in the
catalogue of his exhibition at the Tate Gallery in Liverpool in 1990.
The French poet's essay on 'The Painter of Modern Life' was used
to describe the artist as zflaneur, a passionate spectator. His work was

A Homecoming
311
to distil the eternal from the passing show. He must stand outside his
society and be a modern aristocrat, a dandy who could transform the
instant into the constant and become a hero. Even Bacon's attitude to
money and to his growing fortune seemed to stem from Baudelaire,
who had
declared:
'The dandy does
not
aspire
to money
as
to
something essential. This crude passion he leaves to vulgar mortals;
he would be perfectly content with a limitless credit at the bank.'
Bacon's indifference and even isolence towards earning vast amounts
of cash was, indeed, that of a dandy. He could be believed when he
said he would be happy going back to the income he had once had
when he worked as a cook and a general servant, although this would
hardly have suited his followers in his late age.
In spite of his open hands and filled pockets. Bacon did intend to
leave a fortune behind him to somebody. He was very pleased by the
astuteness
of Marlborough
Fine
Art
in marketing
his
paintings.
They just sell all my pictures abroad,' he said, 'and there's no VAT
on exports.' Many millions of pounds were placed in Switzerland,
although much of this money was spent on generosity to the surviving
members of his
family
in South Africa and
to some of his
close
friends in Europe. In fact, when
I spoke at length to Bacon in 1988,
he ended our session by leaping to his
feet and saying, 'Can you
think of a bad cause, Andrew.^'
I had the temerity to reply, 'What
about yourself,
Francis.^' He laughed and
said,
'That's
too bad
a
cause. But if I don't get to my solicitors this afternoon, a few million
is going to go to my something sister in South Africa.'
As
it turned out, he reached his solicitors, and there would be a
vast fortune
to
leave behind him. He was not
in the position of
Salvador Dali or de Kooning at the end of their
lives, when their
surviving
relatives
and
batteries
of lawyers
surrounded them
to
manage
the
millions and
try
to
exclude
the
galleries
with
their
contracts.
Dali had ended
sick and besieged
in
his house, while
thousands of his faked works flooded the art markets of the world.
De Kooning had been
set to paint to the bitter end, even though
suffering from advanced Alzheimer's disease which was said only to
affect his memory, not his brush-strokes or his vision. This moribund
industry was too valuable to let the man idle, after one of his pictures
reached a price of twenty-million dollars. But Bacon retained control

312
Francis Bacon
of his faculties and his paintings and his estate until his death. The
rule of chance may have been his
ideal, but never the
loss of the
mastery of his choice.
Like
Picasso,
the painter he thought the
greatest
artist of the
century. Bacon held on to the end. In the last interview he gave to
the Director of the Picasso Museum in Paris, he said that he w^as
very influenced by Picasso when he was young, although 'now you're
so flooded with
illustrations of everything, you hardly know what
you're principally influenced by'. He said that he thought Picasso as
a Spaniard was basically Surrealist. He particularly loved Picasso's
pictures by the beach, the blue and the colour of the sand, and the
quality of pathos in his heads of Marie-Therese Walter, pathos in
the sense of a longing for something which could not happen. Pathos
existed even for him, although he knew he was finished at death.
He travelled to Madrid in the spring of 1992, to be consoled by
his Spanish banker. He felt unwell and was taken to a hospital in the
city. There he had a heart attack and could not be revived. He died
on the 28th of April
at the age of eighty-two
at the height of his
renown. Yet his funeral was in keeping with his command over his
life. There were few formaUties and none of his close friends were
present. As Ian Board, the inheritor of the Colony Club, declared:
'Francis said he came into the world with nothing and wanted
to
leave with nothing. He said the gutter or a ditch was good enough
for him, so he settled on cremation. He was not a theatrical man and
crowds gathering around a grave was the last thing he wanted.' Some
journalists appeared at the final ceremony at the Almudena Cemetery
and saw a solitary bouquet of yellow and white roses sent from his
drinking companions at the French Pub in Soho. Just before three
o'clock,
a hearser disgorged
a
plain, dark wooden
coffin with two
copper handles and a cross on the Hd - a final rehgious touch that
Bacon would not have approved. Within eight minutes, the coffin
was wheeled into the recess over the furnace to the taped music of
Gregorian chants, and the body of the artist was reduced to ashes.
The urn was consigned onto a flight back to Britain. That was
all,
an
exit without sentiment. 'We can remember Francis without
a
service,' Ian Board said, holding a champagne wake in the club. 'He
was not a religious person, so why bring in God after his death.^' A

A Homecoming
313
last photograph of him in his coffin showed Bacon with sHck hair
instead of curls, and a bandana round his forehead with his name on
it. 'He probably commissioned
it himself,' Board said.
The
tributes from
his
fellow
artists were
the most
significant.
*Bacon achieved Flaubert's wish to be as unlike his neighbours as
possible,' R.
B.
Kitaj
said.
'I think he realized some of the most
unexpected
stylistic
insights
since
the War,
the best painter
in
a
barren
time,'
Peter
Blake
concurred,
although he was
far from
Bacon's influence. 'He was the
last of the Bohemian figures, who
would not have been worried by a mortgage or anything which most
people worry about: he
dedicated
his
life
to
his
paintings.
I
will
always admire
his
full Bohemian
life.' And Bridget Riley, equally
distant
from
Bacon's
example,
stressed
his
difference
from
his
country. 'Bacon cannot be called an English
artist. There
is
little
trace of national school tradition in his work and for that alone he
was a liberating influence.
I admired him for his independence of
spirit, for the stringent conditions he set himself, and for his sense
of beauty: a terrible beauty perhaps, but one which
is measure
to
what he called "the fact".' Lucian Freud also forgot past differences
to remember Bacon as the man who amused and excited him by
talking about the paint carrying the form and packing a lot of things
into a single brush-stroke - a million miles away from anything he
could ever do. The power of paint was Bacon's legacy.
The art critics and the gallery directors joined in the praise. It was
not a case of the usual De mortuis nil nisi bunkum.
It was a genuine
appreciation of the leading artist of his age. As his Soho friend, the
art critic George Melly said:
'I agree with the cHched belief that he
was the greatest British painter since Turner. He was a charming
companion, generous, waspish and a marvellous
gossip, not
at
all
gloomy, although his paintings were otherwise.
I especially liked the
excellent way he was able to use paint not to imitate reality but to
make
it real.' His opinion had been confirmed by a previous director
of the Tate Gallery, Sir Alan Bowness, who had mounted the second
retrospective of Francis Bacon there. Bowness specified that Bacon's
work set the standard
for his time, for he was surely the greatest
painter then alive:

314
Francis Bacon
No
artist
in our century has presented the human predicament
with such insight and feeling. The paintings have the inescapable
mark of the present;
I am tempted to add the word alas, but for
Bacon the virtues of truth and honesty transcend the tasteful. They
give to his paintings a terrible beauty that has placed them among
the most memorable images in the entire history of art. And these
paintings have a timeless quality that allows them to hang naturally
in our museums beside those of Rembrandt and Van Gogh.
Although Bacon declared that he did not want his dead art to hang
in museums, Bowness was correct. Even
if Bacon painted
for the
sensation of the present, he constructed his paintings to serve as the
everlasting memorials of his time. He was, in the end, a Platonist.
Those who could not create, had children. Those who could, created
art. He had
an
eye on
posterity
rather than
passing fame.
His
problem lay only in his materials and his methods. His use of acrylic
and other inferior paints as well as raw canvas militated against the
long survival of his works, although his hemming of them behind
thick
glass argued
a wish
for
their preservation. Most
certainly.
Bacon's vanity about his body and his appearance extended to his
pictures. They should always look their best.
There was much speculation about where his fortune would go.
Even the Chairman of Marlborough Fine Art, the Duke of Beaufort,
did not know what his premier artist was worth and was amazed at
the way he had lived. *0f course I had no idea how much he left,' he
told reporters, 'but he lived in a filthy little place and led a very simple
life. He didn't even have a car.' The Duke was being circumspect.
After the Rothko case, in which the relatives and the beneficiaries of
the American painter sued Marlborough Fine Art over an
estate
worth dozens of ipiiUions of pounds, he would say nothing until the
will was proved and an agreement was reached with the legatees.
When he died, Bacon was far too rich for the self he had made.
His
last homecoming was
to death's door, and he always knew
that he would knock there. He had made provisions before he
left,
trying to avoid the desperate Htigation that usually breaks out when a
rich painter
dies,
the
fight between the
gallery with an
exclusive
contract, the surviving members of the family, the lovers and other
beneficiaries, and
the
inheritors of paintings,

discarded by the
artist, which now could flood the market. Yet his
millions and his legacy had always been irrelevant to the
artist. His
ashes would have
stirred with black mirth
in
his urn
to hear the
pitiful claims made on his estate. One chance encounter in Soho,
Michael Leventis, said that Bacon had promised him the studio door
daubed with the whirls of the artist's palette.
'I already have one of
Francis's easels and a couple of signed prints. The easel means a lot
to me.
It has
all the colours he used on some of his best-known
paintings.
I would never dream of using it.'
This supposed bequest would
not be
answered. Some
of the
obituaries called on Bacon's clutter of a studio to be preserved for
the nation - exactly what he would have hated. He wanted
to be
bom, to paint, to eat and drink and have sex, and to die. To make a
monument of his transience was anathema. And
yet,
it would be
done, with that extraordinary English belief in preserving the ephem-
eral and calling it traditional.
Of the immediate accounts of his Hfe, the facts and the sensations,
Brian Sewell wrote the most searching one:
He took the Crucifixion, stripped it of all its Christian implications,
and invested
it instead with the universal beasdiness of man and
abattoir, running with blood, deafened with screams. As a portrait
painter he was not the friend with insight but the harsh interrog-
ator, the man outside the ring of light with lash and electrodes
close
at hand. His prisoners,
presidents, popes and
old
friends
squirmed.
He used the ideas of the trap, the cell, the cage, the X-ray and
the heavy fall of light to imprison and torment his subjects to distil
the
violence,
and
to
assault complacent
senses
with
graceless
nakedness on the lavatory pan and vomit in the wash basin
.
.
.
Bacon took the vile, sexually and politically obscene, and shud-
deringly
visceral, and
lifted them with
paint
so
that we might
contemplate ferociously profane images of cruelty and despair and
see in them an inheritance from the great Renaissance themes of
religious and temporal power.
Titian, Rembrandt and Velazquez might not have
cared
for
Bacon's work
but
they would
have
recognized
kinship
in
his
astonishing mastery of paint and the profound pessimistic atheism
of his images. He was the perfect mirror of the spirit of our age.


Endpiece
What is truth? said jesting Pilate, and would not stay for an

Indeed, Bacon
did reach
his
soHcitors, Theodore Goddard, and
dispose of his fortune in a will. The bulk of the estate in England
including the studio in Reece Mews was left to John Edwards, who
had
already removed
all
the
valuables from
the mews
for
safe-
keeping on the news of the artist's death. Its value was first estimated
at sixty million pounds, although much of it was said to be in unsold
paintings, some of them
in the hands of Marlborough Fine
Art.
The Duke of Beaufort was quick to cast doubt on the worth of the
estate, declaring that it could only lay claim to half a dozen paintings.
He acknowledged that there might be many unfinished or rejected
works scattered around, but he would be surprised if they were very
good. 'He
left work unfinished when he wasn't pleased with
it. All
this talk about a million pounds a picture
is absolute rubbish.' The
final value of the estate in England was proved at less than eleven
million pounds, while the major Bacon painting of 1969, 'Study of a
Nude with Figure in a Mirror', did not fetch more than £700,000 in
the Sotheby's saleroom, in the December of the year of the
artist's
death.

Francis Bacon
The Duke could show such confidence because the Marlborough
held the whip hand.
It had an exclusive contract with the dead artist,
who
had
rarely
signed
his
paintings.
It
was
uniquely
able
to
authenticate
any
Bacon
paintings,
because
there
had
been
no
catalogue raisonne for nearly thirty years. The many pictures given by
Bacon to the Edwards family and other close friends would have to
be
verified, and
the
gifts proved by
the
recipients. Without
that
acknowledgement from the Marlborough,
the works of art would
have a murky provenance and not be worth much on the market.
John Edwards did, however, move quickly to show his responsibility
for the bequest of the bulk of the
artist's estate, whatever
its value
might turn out to be.
'I am going to keep the house and
studio
exactly as
it
is,' he declared.
'I am going to live in
it until
I die and
then donate
it to the nation. When
I pop
off, then
it's up to them
what they do with
it.' Lord Gowrie knew what might happen.
It
would be
difficult to open the studio to the public because of the
narrow stairs, which nobody understood how Bacon navigated when
he was drunk. But it remained of
* extraordinary interest, because he
used
it as his palette, he mixed his paints on the walls'.
No
static
studio could commemorate an
artist, who had made
painting a process, where his will was overruled by his instinct, and
where he was 'a medium for accident and chance'. Equally lost was
his method of work, the early rising at dawn, the concentrated attack
on
the
canvas
until
lunchtime,
the
sauntering and
drinking and
gambling for the rest of the day. Bacon had hated the afternoons,
saying that 'they're absolutely revolting, they're a wash-out'. But he
had
felt better again in the evenings, acquiring a hangover for the
next morning's session of painting. None of that wild way of work
and life could be preserved.
Nor could the way he put his daydreams into paint be left to the
nation. He had insisted that he was not gifted or inspired, but merely
receptive of the series of images, which his unconscious had acquired
during his long life. His job was to 'rivet the appearance' of a picture
seen in a passing vision or a glimpse. 'Pictures drop in like
slides,'
he once said. 'The way
I see them
is not necessarily related to the
way I paint them.' That had to do with the nervous system and with
chance. But so many pictures came to him in his daydreams that he

Endpiece
319
had even wanted to make a film from the thousands of urgent images
he had never used.
There could be no studio legacy for the
British people
in how^
Bacon thought or painted. In a way, he had been correct. His work
was dead without the living
artist, without the continuing process.
He was what he was doing, not what he had done, although that
defined his past life. He was an existentialist in that sense, as well as
a dandy and something of a nihilist in his 'compulsive attention to
the inevitability of death'. In his
final interview, he had laughed at
his own bleak attitude, saying, VeVe only become civilised towards
horror.
I mean, we accept
it now as an everyday thing.
It's sort of
ladled out to us like soup.' But his concentration on horror and dying
was his contribution to the images of our time.
So powerful were these images that they have become the only
legacy worth preserving. They were too raw and sickening for some.
As early as
1952, John Berger had complained that we looked
at
Bacon instead of going to Belsen, and this was not a constructive
attitude. Other moralists among the art critics agreed. Peter Fuller
recalled
that when Pope Innocent X
first viewed
his
portrait by
Velazquez,
he
exclaimed,
'Troppo
vero.' To
be
too
true
was
Velazquez's
technique,
but even
in
his
paintings
of dwarfs and
freaks, he had given them
a
defiant human
dignity. But Bacon's
pursuit of truth and the fact seemed to owe more to the violence and
perversity of his imagination, so that he produced a travesty rather
than an extraction. He was a wonderful painter, in the poet Kathleen
Raine's opinion, 'But his
is a misuse of art. He sets at large in the
world images that are a denial of the sacred reality.'
Bitchy and homosexual friends from Soho such as Colin Maclnnes
could
call Bacon
'the Norman Hartnell of the horror movement'.
His perverse images became so chic and prevalent that the designer
of the film about the cannibal serial killer. The Silence of the Lambs
used
Bacon's
obsessive
constructions
of
foul
figures
locked
in
transparent cages as his inspiration for the
set of the incarcerated
murderer. But even those like Bryan Robertson, who did not believe
that Bacon painted the entire human condition, and that a screaming
man sitting in an expensive hotel bedroom failed to represent uni-
versal suffering, did admit to the power of the artist's iconography.

320
Francis Bacon
He was a marvellous painter, 'who caught a nerve in painting as no
artist has ever done before.' Acutely sensitive to surface, he created
some of the strongest images of the century. 'He had
a
fantastic
feeling for the figure in space: trapped, pinned down or imperilled
like a moth or a hunk of meat.'
That was the genius of Bacon. He was receptive to the plethora of
images of his childhood and the newsreels and the snapshots which
he saw. He even found an engineering book on industrial filters very
stimulating. He trawled through such material and transmuted it into
a universal perception of his insight. In a way, a Bacon painting does
touch an exposed nerve more than a photograph of Belsen and does
make the viewer feel sick at human violence. His screaming popes
jerk the grandeur of the Velazquez portrait, caged and yelling, into
this moment. His reduction of the Crucifixion to a butcher's shop
does deny the sacred reality, but
it also affirms the negation of God
in this century. If Bacon's imagination was perverse, there is a streak
of perversity in most of us, and he translated that into a revelation of
what we
are
in secret and may not wish to admit. The nerve he
caught in his pictures
still twists in mankind, and in depicting his
own sensations, he brought to light our hidden desires and our griefs
along with his own.
Bacon claimed to have no system of beliefs. 'If I wanted to express
philosophy', he once said,
'I would write - use words, not paint.' In
point of fact, his philosophy was as consistent and coherent as that
of his namesake. Lord Verulam, Viscount St. Albans. He learned
it
from his experience and from what the French critics wrote of him.
They ordered his 'rules of chance' into a logic that disclaimed itself
in a gentlemanly show of depreciation and irony. Bacon revealed his
philosophy
in
hi^
paintings and
discounted
it
in
his
talk, which
asserted along with Balzac that 'hazard was the greatest artist'.
Yet he had what W. H. Auden wished for a birthday present, no
'confusion of what we
say and do with who we
really
are'. The
sensations of his
life were the sensations of his painting. Once he
was driving through France with a friend when they came across a
bad
collision.
'There was blood and
glass
all
over
the
road,' he
recalled. 'But
I remember thinking that there was a beauty about
it.
I didn't feel the horror of it, because
it was part of life.' On another

Endpiece
321
occasion he hired a train to take him and a large group of friends to
the South of France and back to Paris. The bUnds were closed over
the carriage windows, caviare and champagne were served, poker
and roulette were played, the only stop was to reverse the engine and
return.
It was a process in sealed spaces of pleasure and risk with
companions, which was as futile as the journey through life, signify-
ing nothing. Yet he relented by finally accepting to stay the week-
end at Chateau Lafite with Baron Eric de Rothschild. He had always
refused before because he had never owned a smoking or dinner-
jacket. He had to be reassured that he would be welcome as he was
in this new age of the appreciation of genius.
Bacon ended in fear of death, as he always had been, and without
reconciliation with God. Yet he had reconciled himself with life as
it
was. One of Tom Stoppard's characters once said, 'This is the life.'
The answer was, 'This
is a
life, among others.' Bacon's
life was a
life among others. His genius was his own, he shared
it through his
pictures with the world, he was unfortunate in love, amoral only by
circumstance, generous in fact and to a
fault. He was a man who
pursued the ultimate truth without fear or favour, and who jested
like
Pilate about what was truth. He delighted
in giddiness in his
playing and counted
it bondage to fix his beUefs, except in the need
to paint. He affected free-will in thinking and in all his actions.
He usually protested that he painted only for himself. He com-
mitted
to canvas
his private visions, expressing his
life. His boon
companions, such as Daniel Farson, derided the critics who saw a
human significance or a historical importance in his works. Yet he
spoke otherwise to myself as a social historian and to art historians
such
as John
Russell, who was
frequently told by Bacon
that he
always had
a
great
object
at
the back of his mind,
to paint
'the
History of Europe
in my lifetime'. To us, he did acquiesce in the
proposition that he was trying to depict the violence of his times and
the angst of his age.
It was not that he was duplicitous or that he did protest too much.
More than most men, he spoke exactly what was on his mind and
had no pretensions. To avoid being a hypocrite, he stressed that all
was personal to him and without significance. He never claimed too
much
for what he
did.
In
the
Anglo-Irish manner of the bom

322
Francis Bacon
gendeman, he ran down his genius and his influence. As his ancestor,
die noble philosopher Francis Bacon, wrote 'Of Truth',
'a mixture
of a lie doth ever add pleasure'.
To paraphrase what W. H. Auden wrote about 'The
Novelist',
there could have been a comment on Bacon, 'The Artist', that he:
And in his own weak person, if he can,
Must suffer fiercely all the wrongs of Man.
The images of Bacon did transmute his personal pain into universal
grief. Of course, he was hardly a Christ to absolve our sins, although
he painted his crucifixions as dead meat. His metier - to use again
the only word which gave a meaning to existence in Camus's novel
The Plague - was to describe human suffering and pain, as he did
with his Furies at the base of the Cross. He was certainly conscious
of those references.
If he insisted later that he performed uncon-
sciously, so be
it. He was
still a lightning-rod struck by two World
Wars. His works were also the erratic flashes of decades of thunder-
ous peace. As a conductor of the force and the agony of humanity,
he was the true transmitter of the burned facts of this century.
The most admirable
quality
in man
is
generosity of spirit.
Sir
Michael Levey paid
tribute
to
that part of Francis Bacon. When
the National Gallery organised a public appeal in 1971
to acquire
Titian's 'Death of Actaeon', Bacon was introduced
to Levey by
Sonia Orwell. He became involved
in
a radio appeal and gave
a
dinner for people who might become
significant contributors. He
gave a substantial donation himself, although he was not rich at the
time. He chose to remain anonymous and provoked this statement
after his death from Sir Michael:
My experiences do not include
a comparable
instance
of such
instinctive, imaginative, generous support for acquisition of an old
master painting for the nation from a great living painter, but then
I am not aware of having met another painter whose greamess
seemed to me - seems, rather - so uncontestable.
Francis Bacon was not a violent man, and yet he
lived
in violent
times. To David Sylvester, he told of what violence meant to him.

Endpiece
323
and so gave an insight into his century and his work. He had been
accustomed always
to
live through forms of violence. These had
affected him, but they were
different
to the violence
in painting,
which had nothing to do with the violence of war. He had tried to
remake the violence of reality
itself. This was not only the simple
violence as when he said that a rose was violent, 'but it's the violence
also of the suggestions within the image
itself which can only be
conveyed through paint.' He conveyed that in his Ufe and violent
times.


Notes
I am profoundly grateful to Francis Bacon for taking the time to talk
to me with his usual frankness and illumination.
I am also indebted
to Henry McDowell
for
his
researches on
the Bacon
family
in
Ireland, and
to the Imperial War Museum for providing me with
the military history of Anthony Bacon. Indispensable were the long
interviews Francis Bacon gave to Sir John Rothenstein, reported in
Francis Bacon
(intro.
Rothenstein,
text by Ronald
Alley, London,
1964), which also supplies a definitive catalogue raisonne oi dX\ Bacon's
early works, including some which are now destroyed;
in Modem
English Painters III: Wood to Hockney (London, 1974); and in Time's
Thievish Progress: Autobiography III (London, 1970). Also indispens-
able are the Bacon interviews given to Hugh M. Davies in
1973,
reported
in
his
thesis, Francis Bacon: The Early and Middle
Years,
igzS-igsS (New York and London, 1978); also to David Sylvester,
reported in Interviews with Francis Bacon (London, 1975) and to John
Russell, whose Francis Bacon (London, 1971 and rev.
ed.
1979)
is
authoritative on his subject.
I am further obliged to Bacon's
talks
with Melvyn Bragg and Daniel Farson. Many of the people
I have
interviewed do not wish to be identified because of Bacon's wish to
have no biography written of him. These confidential sources are
protected
in
the
notes,
but
full
references
will
be
provided
to
qualified Bacon
scholars.
I am
particularly
grateful
to and
have
acknowledged Bruce Bernard and Sarah Fox-Pitt and Shusha Guppy
and Donald M. Hess and Barry Joule and Pamela Firth Matthews
and Kenneth Partridge and Patrick Procktor and John Richardson
and Lady Jane Willoughby and Michael Wishart and Sir Peregrine
Worsthome. Unless otherwise attributed in the notes to the text, the

326
Francis Bacon
comments on his life by Francis Bacon come from my own notes on
the conversations I held with him in 1988.
Chapter One
Pamela Firth Matthews has supplied me with many early memories of her
cousin, Francis Bacon, who was always most generous and kind
to her,
even as a small
girl. She has also shown me the Firth family albums with
the
only
existing
photographs
of Francis
as
a
baby
and many
other
extraordinary snapshots of the life and houses of the Protestant Ascendancy.
Henry McDowell has interviewed most of those people who still remember
the Bacon family and the Bells and the Supples in County Kildare. Michael
McConville, Ascendancy
to Oblivion: The Story of the Anglo-Irish (London,
1986)
gives
a good general picture of the Protestant Ascendancy. C. S.
Andrews,
Dublin Made Me
(Dubhn,
1930)
speaks
of the
feelings
of
Catholics
to
Protestants,
while
L. MacManus,
White Light and Flame:
Memories ofthe Irish Literary Revival and the Anglo-Irish War (Dublin, 1929)
was the traveller from DubHn who wimessed the London black-out. Air
Commodore
L.
E.
O.
Charlton,
War
over England
(London,
1938)
described the Zeppelin psychosis of the time and the methods used
to
counter the air threat.
Chapter Two
Francis Bacon's memories of Ireland are taken from the introduction to
the catalogue of his exhibition
at the Tate Gallery in 1962 and from a
conversation with his close friend Barry Joule. Other sources were Grey
Gowrie, ^Homage fo Work and Love,' the Guardian, 29 April 1992, and
Shusha Guppy, Telegraph Sunday Magazine, 4 November 1984, and Richard
Cork in The Times,
16 March
1991. The quotations from contemporary
sources of the way Ireland was in the time of troubles are taken from TO.',
The Administration ofIreland, igio (London, 1921): Joice M. Nankivell and
Sydney Loch, Ireland in Travail (London, 1922): and Professor W. Allison
Phillips, The Revolution of Ireland, igo6-ig2j (London,
1923). Generally
useful were Constantine Fitzgibbon, Out ofthe Lion 5 Paw: Ireland Wins Her
Freedom (London,
1968); Richard Bennett, The Black and Tans (London,

Notes
327
1976): and Michael Hopkinson, Green against Green: The Irish
Civil War
(London 1986). Henry McDowell contributed, 'The Big House: A Geneal-
ogist's Perspective and a Personal Point of View' to Ancestral Voices: The Big
House in Anglo -Irish Literature (Otto Rauchbauer ed., Hildesheim and New
York, 1992).
I have closely followed the masterly analysis of the British reaction to
homosexuality during the
First World War
in Samuel Hynes's A War
Imagined: The First World War and English Culture (London, 1990). Oscar
Wilde's leading biographer is Richard Ellman.
I also acknowledge the help
of another masterwork, Paul Fussell, The Great War and Modem Memory
(London,
1975) and of Nicholas de Jongh, Not
in Front of the Audience
(London, 1992). Francis Bacon spoke of homosexuality as an affliction to
Shusha Guppy and Grey Gowrie, who was told by Bacon that his nature
was to
tell everything. Francis Bacon told David Sylvester of his parents'
objections to him being an
artist. He also told Shusha Guppy about his
background of gambling. His opinion on Ireland as a country of Uterature,
not paint, was given to Gerard Regnier of the Picasso Museum in Paris.
The information on the patron who took him to Berlin was supplied by
Henry McDowell, although Hugh Davies supplied Bacon's evidence
in
1973
of his route
to
Berlin. Lady Caroline Blackwood wrote of Bacon
and
his friend talking to her about his
Irish boyhood in 'Francis Bacon
(1909-1992)', The New York Review , 24 September 1992.
Chapter Three
I have used Oliver Lawson Dick's edition of Aubrey's BriefLives (London,
1949). Francis Bacon spoke of his early perception of mortality and of the
reason he was always helped when he was young to his friend and
critic
David Sylvester. Christopher Isherwood's remarks on
'civil monsters' are
quoted
in Samuel Hynes's admirable
introduction
to
the
Folio
Society
edition of Isherwood's novel. Mr Norris Changes
Trains (London,
1990).
The Temple by Stephen Spender was eventually published
in London in
1988.
Christopher and His Kind, igzg-igjg, was published by Isherwood
in
London in 1977:
it contains his description of the West End bars. There
are two useful biographies of him, Isherwood by Jonathan Fryer (London,
1977)
and
Christopher Isherwood: A
Critical Biography by
Brian
Finney
(London, 1979). Auden's Poems dedicated to Isherwood were published in

328
Francis Bacon
London in 1930. Hugh Davies records Bacon's reactions to the sex booths
in Berlin, his vanity as a pretty boy and his reactions to his patron running
off with a woman. Rene Gimpel, Diary of an Art Dealer was pubHshed in
New York in 1966. Peter Sachse, 'Der verkehrte Ball im Eldorado-Kasino',
Berliner Journal May,
1927, described the Eldorado. Christopher Isher-
wood, A
Berlin Diary, Autumn igjo
is
reprinted
in
the FoUo
Society's
edition of Goodbye
to
Berlin (London,
1975) with
drawings by George
Grosz.
Otto Dix
is quoted on photography in the brilliant article by Matthias
Eberle, *Otto Dix and Neue Sachlichkeit\ printed in German Art in the 20th
Century, Painting and Sculpture igo^-igS^ (Munich and London,
1985):
Eberle also supples the criticism of Otto Dix's work. The commentator on
the Weimar Republic was Mrs Seaton Wagner in Germany
in My Time
(London, 1935). Ernst Toller's Brokenbrow with illustrations by Grosz was
pubhshed in London in 1928. He spoke on Berlin to Michael Kimmelman
for The Times, 2 September 1989.
Francis Bacon spoke
to Hugh Davies on
19 May and 26 June
1973,
about the influence of the Picasso Exhibition in Paris on him. Maurice
Sachs was the Goncourt of Paris in the 'twenties in The Decade of Illusion:
Paris igi8-ig28 (New York, 1933). Jean Cocteau told of his experiences
with Picasso
in A
Call
to Order (London,
1926). He
also claimed
that
Picasso had invented the
art of camouflage, which had so impressed the
boy Francis Bacon
in Hyde
Park. He had been discussing a new
field
uniform with Picasso in 191 4, and the Spanish painter had said,
'If they
want to render the army invisible at a distance, let them dress their men as
harlequins.' Hugh Davies was the art critic of Bacon's early career, when
he tried to resolve the influences of Berlin and Paris.
I am indebted
to Lawrence Gowing in his
text with Sam Hunter on
Francis Bacon: The Human Presence (London and Washington,
1989)
for
the correspondence between Andre Masson's stage
set and Bacon's
first
painting of the Crucifixion. Francis Bacon's remarks on leaving a
snail's
trail of slime were printed in The New Decade: 22 European Painters and
Sculptors (New York, 1955), and those on buying a second-hand book on
diseases of the mouth were made to David Sylvester. Alice Prin's biography
and Ernest Hemingway's opinion of her Montparnasse are quoted from
the excellent Kiki's Paris: Artists and Lovers igoo-igjo by Billy Kliiver and
Julie Martin (New York,
1989). The
details on the furniture design and
contemporary architecture which influenced Bacon are shown in Douglas
and Madeleine Johnson,
The Age of Illusion: Art and Politics
in
France,
igi8-ig40 (London, 1987). Janet Flanner's writings were printed in Paris

Notes
329
Was
Yesterday ig2^-igjg
(London,
1973). Janet Planner was
also
an
habituee of the salon of the extraordinary Natalie Barney, then having an
affair with Dolly Wilde, the daughter of Oscar's brother Willie. She bore
such a striking resemblance to her uncle, particularly in her wit and drag
costumes for masquerade balls, that she said,
*I am more Oscar-like than
he was himself - or certainly, during his last sad months before his death
in Paris.
Brassa'i's The Secret Paris of the
'jos
(Paris, 1976)
is what
its publisher
claimed it to be, the photographic equivalent of Toulouse-Lautrec. Perhaps
one of the more amusing episodes of the time was when the epicene Brian
Howard had his clothes stolen in a Parisian male brothel and walked to the
Cafe de Deux Magots, wearing only a stolen maid's frilly apron, which he
refused to return with the words, 'My dear,
I like having a souvenir so very
inappropriate to that night's adventure.' Lord Gowrie wrote of his conver-
sations with Francis Bacon in the Guardian, 29 April 1992. For Bufiuel's
early films,
I have relied on the texts and introduction to L'Age dVr/Un
Chien Andalou (London, 1968).
Chapter Four
Francis Bacon's important reflections on the difference of the violence of
paint and of war were made in his seminal interviews to David Sylvester.
His loathing of his early furniture was expressed to Hugh Davies in 1973,
also an admission of early influences on him because he was perhaps in
love. Roy de Maistre's youth
is excellentiy recalled in David Marr, Patrick
White: A Life (London,
1991) and
in John Rothenstein, Modem English
Painters II: Lewis to Moore (London, 1956), who is brilliant on his subject:
I
use quotations from both these books. Patrick White tells of his relationship
with Roy de Maistre and Francis Bacon
in Flaws
in
the Glass (London,
1 981) which also contains the quotation about his feelings on his homo-
sexual temperament. John Rothenstein
tells of de Maistre's education of
Bacon
in
his 'Francis Bacon', Modem English Painters
III, already cited.
Julian Symons, The Thirties: A Dream Revolved (London, i960) has written
the most
illuminating work on
the
period,
only surpassed
recently by
Valentine Cunningham, British Writers of the Thirties (Oxford, 1988); from
these books, the acknowledged quotations are taken. Bacon also told Hugh
Davies of his early motives for painting the Crucifixion.
Francis Bacon told John Russell of his destroyed painting of the beautiful

330
Francis Bacon
wound, recorded in RusselPs book on Bacon. He told his friend Daniel
Farson about
his
petty
theft and
living off people
in
Gallery (London,
1990). John
Rothenstein
first
stressed
the
importance
of Muybridge's
photographs to Francis Bacon and pointed out that many other painters
also learned from the Victorian photographer of motion: Thomas Eakins,
who was photographed running naked himself, and Meisonnier and Seurat.
He spoke
often
to Bacon about the importance
of photographs
to
the
painter's hfe, as did his other friend and
critic, John Russell, whose work
on Bacon has been cited. Richard Cork wrote on Bacon's preliminaries to
his 'Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion', 1945, in The
Times, 8 May 1992, as did John Rothenstein in his essential introduction
and
picture
notes
to
the
Tate
Gallery
catalogue
of Francis
Bacon's
exhibition there between 4 May and
i July 1962. Sir Roland Penrose spoke
to Hugh Davies about his rejection of Bacon's 'Surreal' paintings on 29
March 1973, and Bacon spoke to Davies about Penrose's remarks on 3
April 1973.
The definitive listing of Francis Bacon's early works
is done by Ronald
Alley in his book with John Rothenstein, Francis Bacon (London,
1964),
from which Rothenstein's remark on Bacon's painting in the
'thirties
is
taken. Giacometti remarked on his inability to be satisfied that a work was
finished
to Alexander Liberman
in The Artist in His Studio (New York,
i960).
Also useful in verifying Bacon's early exhibitions are Roger Berthoud's
two biographies, Graham Sutherland: A Life (London, 1982), and The Life
ofHenry Moore (London, 1987). The owner of 'Corner of the Studio' was
Mrs
Gladys MacDermot, who
asked Bacon
to
design
her
flat
at
98
Ridgemount Gardens. John Rothenstein wrote of Bacon's destruction of
'Abstraction from the Human Form' in his essay on 'Francis Bacon' in his
Modem English Painters III, while Bacon spoke to David Sylvester about the
influence of Eric Hall upon himself and
to John Richardson about the
appeal of gentiemen
in pin-striped
suits and of the Bath Club.
Philip
O'Connor's Memoirs of a Public Baby with an introduction by Stephen
Spender was published in London in 1958. The culture of Fitzrovia and
Soho in the late
'thirties and
'forties
is covered in War Like a Wasp: The
Lost Decade of the
Forties by Andrew
Sinclair
(London,
1989).
Jeffrey
Bernard told me in The Groucho Club of his first encounter with Francis
Bacon and confirmed it in his 'Memories of Francis Bacon', the Independent
on Sunday, 3 May 1992.

Notes
331
Chapter Five
Malcolm Muggeridge wrote on the Bore War in *The Beginning of the
'Forties*, The Windmill,
1946. The quotations from Francis Bacon come
from the important interviews he gave to Hugh Davies on
1 9 May and
1
3

Chapter Seven
Probably the supreme polymath of his time, the underrated Michael Ayrton
writes superbly on
art and
Francis Bacon
in The Rudiments of Paradise
(London,
1971). The most briUiant chapter in a brilliant book
is that on
'The prehensile image', dealing with the impact of photography and film
on Francis Bacon, in John Russell's cited study of him. Mark Roskill wrote
'Francis Bacon
as Mannerist'
{or Art International,
25 September 1963.
Robert Hughes wrote on 'David Hockney' in his penetrating Nothing IfNot
Critical (London,
1990).
David
Sylvester remains
the
major
source
of
interviews with Bacon in his books on the
artist. Hugh Davies's series of
interviews with Bacon in 1973
in his cited thesis remain seminal on the

Francis Bacon
artist's
early
work,
and
include
his
feelings
about
Rembrandt

rivets' and stressed
that his paintings were
autobiographical and that the barriers of the skin could not be broken, even
in love. John Richardson told me about the character of Peter Lacey.
I have taken my accounts of Bacon's Hfe in Tangier and of his meetings
with Paul Bowles and WiUiam Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg in general

Tifiies (intro.
George Melly, London,
1987). Roger Berthoud was
the biographer of
Graham Sutherland, work cited.
Cecil Beaton described his meeting with and sitting for Bacon extensively

The stories about Bacon falling apart with John Minton are recounted in
Frances Spalding's cited biography of Minton. Henrietta Moraes spoke of
her
relationship
with
Deakin
and
Bacon
on
a
television programme
'Without Walls', 26 March 1991. Paul Potts wrote to Daniel Farson about

336
Francis Bacon
his opinion of Muriel Belcher: Farson has written by far the most generous
appraisal of her appeal. Bacon spoke about painting the history of the past
thirty years
to
the Sunday
Times,
5 May
1957. The
description of the
diaspora of the artist from Soho comes from my own book, War like a Wasp,
already cited. Erica Brausen heard of Bacon's leaving the Hanover Gallery
(TGA 863) and
spoke
to
the Daily
Express,

Chapter Eight
I am indebted to Hugh Davies and Sally Yard in their excellent Francis
Bacon (New York, 1986) for their comparison of the cracked mirror in the
bedroom of Reece Mews to Duchamp's 'Large Glass' of 1915-1923. John
Rothenstein writes on Bacon's retrospective at the Tate Gallery and on his
catalogue introduction and meetings with Lucian Freud and on Roy de
Maistre in his memoirs, Time's Thievish Progress, work cited. His piece in
the catalogue
is printed in Francis Bacon, 24 May-i July ig62,
The Tate
Gallery (London, 1962). John Russell's book on Francis Bacon is a work of
art in its own right, and
I remain deeply in its debt. Bacon's admission that
he painted his second triptych of the Crucifixion under drink was recorded
by Ronald Alley in his definitive catalogue of the painter's early works made
with John Rothenstein, Francis Bacon (London, 1964). Lawrence Gowing's
opinion of that triptych is to be found in his work with Sam Hunter, Francis
Bacon (London and Washington, D.C., 1989).
Daniel Farson wrote of hearing about Peter Lacey's death in the Colony
Room in his cited work, Soho in the Fifties. Stephen SptndGr's Journals have
also been cited: these entries date from 23 May and 29 May and 7 June
and
II August 1962. Patrick White recorded
his own wish to become a
painter in Flaws in the Glass, work cited, and represented much of Bacon in
Hurtle Duffield in The Viviseaor {London, 1970). J. R. Ackerley's compari-
son of his method of writing to Bacon's in painting
is to be found in his
biography by
Peter
Parker
(London,

David
Hockney's comments on Bacon are recorded in Portrait ofDavid Hockney
(London, 1991) by Peter Webb and in David Hockney David Hockney (ed.
Nikos Stangos, London, 1991).
Kenneth Partridge and others have told me of the influence of Alfred
Hecht. Francis Bacon's profile was in the Observer, 27 May 1962. Queer
People by Douglas Plummer was published in London in 1963. Bacon told

I am indebted to two brilliant books for my understanding of the feelings
of homosexual
society
in
the
'sixties,
particularly through
the
theatre:
Nicholas de Jongh, Not
in Front of the Audience: Homosexuality on Stage
(London, 1992) and to Simon Shepherd, Because We're Queers: The Life and
Crimes ofKenneth Hallivpell and Joe Orton (London, 1989), an incisive and
militant work that makes John Lahr's biography of Orton, Prick Up Your
Ears (London, 1978) appear out of touch. The British Medical Association
published
its
report on 'Homosexuality and
Prostitution'
in London
in
1955. The anecdotes of Bacon's meetings with Giacometti are well told in
his
entertaining biography by James Lord, work already
cited. Andrew
Forge commented on Bacon's portraits in his admirable book with Dawn
Ades on Francis Bacon (London, 1985). Peter Fuller wrote the chapter on
'The Visual Arts' for The Cambridge Guide to the Arts in Britain, edited by
Boris Ford, Vol. 9, Since the Second World War (Cambridge, 1988). Robert
Hughes wrote on Bacon
in
his
incisive The Shock of the New
(rev.
ed.,
London, 1991), and spoke to me about Bacon.
Chapter Nine
Francis Bacon talked to both David Sylvester and Hugh Davies about his
studio
in Limehouse; but most of the memories of his being there are
contained in Limehouse Days: A Personal Experience ofthe East End by Daniel

338
Francis Bacon
Farson, published
in London
in
1991. The
quotations from 'Sweeney
Among the Nightingales'
is taken from T.S. Eliot, the work already cited.
John Russeirs analysis of Bacon in his short book on him remains definitive,
particularly on his feeUngs for France. The artist spoke to Sylvester about
the significance of the Nazi symbols in the Munich 'Crucifixion' and on
annihilating his other pictures, both in The Brutality ofFact^ work cited, and
in his
first conversation with Sylvester
to appear
in print in the Sunday
Times, 14 July 1963. Bacon spoke to 'Art Class' by John Wayne-Morgan,
printed in the Sun,
2 November 1965. Bernard Walsh spoke to the Daily
Mail,
12 January 1966, of his pleasure
in receiving a Bacon painting of
Lucian Freud, and Bacon spoke of his exhibition at the Galerie Maeght in
Paris to the Evening Standard, 19 November 1966.
Terence Mullaly compared Bacon's Marlborough show to the napahn
bomb in the Daily Telegraph, 9 March 1967. Nigel Gosling conducted the
brilliant interview and
analysis of Bacon's work that same year
for the
Observer, 5 March 1967. John Richardson was my main source for George
Dyer's
suicide attempt
in New York, while Daniel Farson reported on
Frank Norman's
attempts
to
write
on Bacon
and
on
George
Dyer's
character and mistaken trip to Devon in Soho in the Fifties, work cited. The
Daily Telegraph, 3 June 1971, gave a full report of Bacon's
trial on drugs
charges.
The Orton
Diaries was
edited by John Lahr and published
in
London
in
1986. Richard Cork did the most important interview with
Bacon in early October, 1972, before his Paris exhibition, as he was to do
the most significant analysis of his Tate
'Crucifixion'
after the painter's
death. David Hockney spoke
to The Times, 29
April
1992, on Bacon's
scream for George Dyer at La Coupole. Lawrence Raab's poem, 'Figure
with Hypodermic Syringe', was printed in Encounter, November 1971. Of
course. Bacon with his usual disclaimer of any message discounted the
syringe, saying he wanted to nail his subject to the bed. Although people
said he was suggesting a drug-addict, he
said, 'Not
at
all.
I
just put a
syringe in.'
Chapter Ten
David Sylvester's interviews with Francis Bacon were first published in the
United States of America in 1975
to coincide with the show of Bacon's
recent work at the Metropolitan Museum in New York. Nine interviews
with
Bacon were
recorded
between
1962
and
1986, when
Sylvester

Notes
339
published an intercut version in his acclaimed The Brutality ofFact, Third
Enlarged Edition (London,
1987). When
it appeared, Stephen Spender
asserted that it might have as great an influence on contemporary painting
as the
critical writings of Pound and Eliot had on modernism in poetry,
while Graham Greene found that
it ranked with the journals of Delacroix
and the
letters of Gauguin.
Certainly, these illuminating interviews with
Bacon
put
any
researcher
deeply
in
debt
to
David
Sylvester, whose
construction of the conversations is as complex and subde as Bacon's own
paintings.
Lorenza Trucci, Francis Bacon (Milan and New York,
1975)
gives an
admirable compilation and dissection of the artist's painting up to the early
'seventies. Michel
Leiris wrote
his profound
analysis of the painter
for
Francis Bacon (London,
1988). Guy Brett compared Leger with Bacon in
The Times, 27 October 1971, while Pierre Schneider found that Bacon had
radically changed modem art in The Times, 7 November
1 97 1
. Bacon spoke
about the offer of a show at the Metropolitan Museum in New York to the
Evening Standard, 3 November 1971, and The Times stated that Trancis
Bacon paintings boost Britain' on
1 1 January 1972.
Daniel Parson's memories of Dyer's and Deakin's deaths are recorded
in his Soho in the Fifties, work cited. John Russell's work on Francis Bacon
has been previously mentioned,
as has Hugh Davies's
thesis on Bacon,
based on his series of interviews with the painter, this one about reacting to
one's times on 6 March 1973.
1 am most grateful to Barry Joule for talking
to me about his friendship with Bacon. Stephen Spender wrote on Bacon's
views on frustration and despair' in his Journal, work cited, on
1 2 March
1974. Jeffrey Bernard wrote on Bacon in the Independent on Sunday, 3 May
1992. Tom
Driberg's encounter with Bacon
at the Colony Room was
described in the Sunday Times Magazine, 25 August 1974. James Kirkup's
poem, *The Love that Dares to Speak
its Name', was published in Gay
News
96, June
1976.
Kirkup
objected
to
the
Christian
version
of the
Crucifixion in the Observer, 17 July 1976. The summing-up of the judge at
the
trial
is quoted
in John Sutherland's penetrating
Offensive Literature:
Decensorship in Britain, ig6o-ig82 (London, 1982).
Bacon spoke
to Sylvester about his
dislike of the welfare
state and a
happy society. The critic of Bacon's exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum
in New York
for The Burlington Magazine, June
1975, was Norman W.
Canedy. Bacon gave his one -line witticisms before his American exhibition
to the Daily Mail, 18 March 1975. John Russell again was the recipient of
Bacon's liking for flat landscapes.

to Melvyn Bragg in his admirable programme on the artist, 'Francis Bacon',
transmitted on The
South Bank Show,
9 June
1985.
Barrie
Penrose
reported on the Bacon forgeries from Italy in the Observer, 4 April 1976.
Joan Wyndhdim's Anything Once was published in London in 1992. Richard
Cork turned against Bacon's exhibition in Paris in the Evening Standard,

November 1971, and Edward Lucie-Smith denounced Bacon's contempt
in the same paper on 5 January 1978.
Gilles DeLeuze, Francis Bacon: Logique de la Sensation was published in
Paris in 1984. His words about declining to be a Companion of Honour
were spoken to Richard HoUiday for the Sunday Telegraph,
5 June 1977.
Hugh Davies reported further interviews with Bacon in his admirable book
on Francis Bacon with
Sally Yard, work already
cited. And Bacon spoke
about American abstract art and the necessity of the past to Shusha Guppy,
the Telegraph Sunday Magazine, 4 November 1984.
Chapter Twelve
This chapter is wholly dependent on the incisive work by Gilles DeLeuze,
Francis Bacon: Logique de
la Sensation
(Paris,
1984).
It
is an original and
compelling
analysis of Bacon's work. As
in the previous
chapter,
I am
grateful
to Francis Bacon himself for talking
to me
in
1988 about the
DeLeuze book and to Melvyn Bragg in 1985. Bacon's admiration of the
early works of Cezanne is attested by Sam Hunter in his excellent essay on
Bacon in his book with Lawrence Gowing on Francis Bacon, work already
cited. John
Livingstone
Lowes's
remarkable
The Road
to Xanadu was
published in London in 1927.
Chapter Thirteen
I am indebted again to Pamela Firth Matthews
for her reminiscences of
her first cousin, Francis Bacon, and particularly to David Sylvester and to
Melvyn Bragg for his conversations with them as well as myself. Stephen
Spender recorded
his conversation with Frank Auerbach in his Journal,

Notes
341
already
cited, and Michael Wishart recorded
his thought on seeing the
painting of the men coupling in Coombe Priory in High Diver, also cited as
has been Daniel Parson's Sacred Monsters. Graham Sutherland wrote
to
Wishart about his break with Bacon on 26 February 1978.
The friend's opinion of Bacon's agile arrival in the Colony Room derives
from his profile, the Observer,
19 May 1985. Elena Salvoni recorded the
painter's opinion of her refurbished L'Escargot in Elena: A Life in Soho
(with Sandy Fawkes, London,
1991).
Gaston
Berlemont
spoke
of his
feehngs about
the French Pub
to Judith Summers, Soho: A History of
London's Most Colourful Neighbourhood (London,
1991). Andrew Forge's
fine essay in his book with Dawn Ades on Francis Bacon has already been
mentioned. David
Sylvester's culminating
live interview with Bacon was
transmitted hy Arena on the BBC on 16 November 1984, while Melvyn
Bragg's probing and
illuminating interview appeared on Thames Tele-
vision's The South Bank Show. Bacon spoke to Shusha Guppy, interview
already cited, about painting as an old man's occupation. In an afterword,
'Notes on Technique',
Sally Yard and Hugh Davies wrote a perceptive
analysis of Francis Bacon's methods of painting in their cited book on him.
Bruce Bernard spoke to me about Bacon's increasing dominance in his
old age and wish to manipulate the records of his past. Richard Francis
spoke on
his opinion of Bacon
to Shusha Guppy. Brian
Sewell's 'The
Loaded Brush' on Francis Bacon was published in the Radio
Times,

November 1984. Lord (Grey) Gowrie recorded his opinions on Bacon in
the Sunday Times Magazine, 19 May 1985. Waldemar Januszczak assessed
the Tate retrospective for the Guardian, 22 May 1985. Bacon himself took
Jane Withers and Anthony Fawcett of The Times around his retrospective,
and
their piece on
it was printed on 20 May
1985, while John Russell
Taylor's criticism of the show was pubHshed two days later. Bacon spoke
to Melvyn Bragg about the Rokeby Venus and to John Russell about the
Degas, 'Woman Drying Herself.
Chapter Fourteen
John Richardson gave me his personal opinion of Bacon's later work, while
Peter Fuller wrote an essay in The Cambridge Guide to the Arts
in Britain:
Volume 9, Since the Second World War (ed. Boris Ford, Cambridge, 1988).
Robert Hughes's opinion of Bacon's work
in The Shock of the New has
already been
cited. The
critic
of the
'purely
evil'
'Second Version
of

342
Francis Bacon
Triptych,
1944' was Richard Dorment, writing in the Daily
Telegraphy
3
February 1989. Bacon asked Michael Kimmelman of the Times Review, 2
September
1989, who was more
surreal than Aeschylus, and then pro-
ceeded with him to see the Constables in the Victoria and Albert Museum,
and then on to the Colony Room. He read from Aeschylus on The South
Bank Show, already cited.
The reviewer of the Bacon show at the Lelong Gallery in Paris in 1987
was Geordie Grieg for the Sunday Times, 4 October 1987. James Birch
spoke of his meetings with Sergei Klokov to Geraldine Norman for the
Independent,
18 March
1988, and Daniel Farson,
for the Daily Mail, 22
March 1988, while David Sylvester and Brian Sewell spoke of the Moscow
show to the writer of the Bacon profile in the Independent, 24 September
1988. Bacon spoke to Geordie Grieg again of his reasons for not going to
Moscow and
of his probable
reception
there
in
the Sunday
Times,
25
September
1988, and saw me shordy afterwards
at Groucho's. WiUiam
Parker reported on 'Russian Taste
for Bacon'
in the Financial Times,
i
October
1988, and Brandon Williams
for The Times,
12 October
1988,
while the reactions of the spectators in the Visitors' Book appeared in the
Sunday Times, 13 November 1988. Patrick Procktor and Barry Joule spoke
to me about the end of Bacon's life.
Daniel Farson wrote of Bacon celebrating his birthday quiedy in the
Sunday
Telegraph, 29 October
1989, and Michael Kimmelman received
most of Bacon's rehearsed opinions for the readers of The Times, date cited.
Bruce Bernard wrote an
illuminating piece on 'The Book
that Bacon
Banned' for the Independent Magazine, 2 April 1992, and spoke to me
at
length about the matter. John Minihan's Photograph ofFrancis Bacon, Samuel
Beckett, William S. Burroughs was published as a catalogue for the October
Gallery, London, February/March, 1990, and the author quoted George
Bernard Shaw on photography. Sam Hunter wrote his authoritative essay
on 'Metaphor and Meaning in Francis Bacon' for Lawrence Gowing and
Sam Hunter, Francis Bacon, work cited: both of the extracts are his incisive
insights.
f
Chapter Fifteen
The Homecoming by Harold
Pinter was
published
in London
in
1965.
Pamela Firth Matthews has been my invaluable guide to Bacon's last years
at Long Melford. Richard Spiro of Wintrust was the banker, who went to

Notes

dinner
in Long Melford. Bacon
told Shusha Guppy of his progressive
happiness a week before he died, and Barry Joule and Kenneth Partridge
told me of the artist's last afflictions. Bacon spoke to Richard Cork for The
Times, i6 March 1991, about his two versions of the Triptych of 1944, and
about his feelings on his future paintings and his life mask and death and
homosexuality and money.
The Times, 29 April
1992, reported the premature reports of Bacon's
death. He had told Patrick Procktor of his loathing of a gallery for his dead
paintings and had spoken on the same theme to Peter Plagens in Newsweek,
II May
1992. Lord Gowrie wrote
a moving obituary on Bacon
in
the
Guardian, 29 April
1992. John McEwan's
brilliant piece on Bacon
as
a
dandy and the heir of Baudelaire was printed in the Sunday Telegraph,
3
May 1992. And Richard Francis also perceptively brought in the influence
of Baudelaire in his essay 'Memory Traces' for the catalogue of the Francis
Bacon
exhibition
at the Tate
Gallery, Liverpool, 20 February 1990-13
January
1991.
Bacon's
interview with Gerard
Regnier,
Director of the
Picasso Museum in Paris, who writes under the name of Jean Clair, was
printed
in
the
catalogue
of an
exhibition
on
the
theme
of
Picasso's
crucifixions, also in The Art Newspaper, No. 19, June 1992.
The artists' tributes to Francis Bacon after his death were printed in the
Sunday Times, 3 May 1992. Sir Alan Bowness's opinion of Francis Bacon
was printed in the catalogue of his second retrospective at the Tate Gallery
in 1985. The Duke of Beaufort spoke to the Evening Standard, 29 April
1992. Michael Leventis was reported in the Daily Telegraph, 29 April 1992.
Brian Sewell wrote Bacon's obituary for the Evening Standard, 28 April
1992.
Endpiece
The Duke of Beaufort spoke about the value of the Bacon estate to the
Evening Standard
-] October, 1992. The Times reported the net value of the
Bacon estate at £10,923,900 and of the Bacon sale at Sotheby's at about
£680,000 on 4 December 1992.
John Edwards spoke about the Bacon bequest to the Sunday Times, 30
August 1992, as did Lord Gowrie. Bacon spoke to David Sylvester about
being a medium for accident and riveting the appearance, and to Richard
Cork about afternoons and
the
car accident
in France. Donald Kuspit
accused Bacon of nihiUsm in 'Francis Bacon: the Authority of Flesh', Art

344
Francis Bacon
Forum, New York, Summer, 1975. The artist's last intendew with Gerard
Regnier has already been cited.
John Berger complained about Bacon and Belsen in a panel meeting at
the ICA,
reported by Lawrence
Alloway,
'Points
of View: Bacon and
Balthus', Art News and Review, 26 January
1952. Peter Fuller compared
Velazquez and Bacon in the Daily
Telegraph, 28 October 1989. Kathleen
Raine spoke of Bacon in The Times, 18 April 1992. Bryan Robertson gave
his opinion of Bacon's work in his obituary on the painter, the Guardian,
29 April
1992.
Sir Michael Levey paid
his
last tribute
to Bacon
in the
Independent, 11 May 1992. And if I end on Bacon's talking on violence to
David Sylvester in The Brutality ofFact, work cited,
it is because that book
records some of the most illuminating conversations ever held between
artist and critic.
