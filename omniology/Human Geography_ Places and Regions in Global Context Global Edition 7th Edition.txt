 ■  Describe  how language both reflects 
and influences the way different 
groups understand and interpret the 
world. 
 ■  Compare and contrast different forms 
of communication, including standard 
language, slang, dialects, social media, 
and nonverbal modes of expression. 
 ■  Interpret how different geographies 
impact the spread or preservation of 
language and how different groups 
use language to give or change a 
place's meaning. 
 ■  Describe the global distribution of the 
world's religions—how they devel-
oped in specific regions and how they 
proliferated around the world. 
 ■  Recognize the difference between 
religions and religious movements 
around the world, and analyze the 
impacts of both on political and social 
life. 
 ■  Interpret the importance of space to 
religion in pilgrimages and sacred 
spaces in every culture.

 As an infant—as young, perhaps, as 8 months old—you had to de-
termine the internal structure of a system that possesses tens of thousands 
of individual elements. Each of the elements is derived from the same col-
lection of materials and combined into larger units. Those units can be put 
together into an infinite set of combinations, although only a limited set of 
those joined units are correct within the context of the system. How does 
an infant proceed? Fortunately, we tend to learn this system effortlessly: The 
system is language, and it is composed of words, sounds, and sentences. 
 But now imagine that you're a deaf child, 6 or 7 years old. You have reached 
this age not fully understanding what it means to be deaf. Imagine how much 
more difficult the mission of acquiring language will be for you. Of course, 
there will not necessarily be sounds involved in forming your language, but 
there must be something else to take the place of sound that will allow you to 
communicate the words and the sentences you wish to convey. 
 Imagine further in this already challenging scenario that it's 1970 and you 
live in Managua, Nicaragua, and there are no teachers at your school who 
know sign language. What is perhaps even more remarkable than the capacity 
of the hearing infant's ability to comprehend and eventually use language is 
the capacity of a group of deaf children, assembled in a collective but without 
the aid of a sign language instructor, to develop their own language so they're 
able communicate with each other. 1 
 These children developed the Nicaraguan Sign Language. It is a unique exam-
ple of how language emerges and becomes populated with a structure, words, 
and sentences. The deaf children created the language, not with the help of their 
teachers or their parents or any other adults but through their interactions with 
each other. Independently, they constructed a natural sign language that contains 
the kinds of grammatical regularities that are key to all languages. And, since the

by Children , Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 98, 23: npn. 
 In 1990, the United Nations published the first of its annual Human Devel-
opment Reports. The report analyzes how economic growth and human 
development are inextricably tied and provides statistics about changes in 
both over time as well as suggestions for how to improve them  ( Figure  5.D ). 
Since 1990, the report has taken the position that women are at a struc-
tural disadvantage compared to men and in its 1997 report, stated baldly, 
"No society treats its women as well as its men." While the differences be-
tween women's and men's pay in the developed world is a common topic 
of discussion and concern (where in the United States for every $1 men 
earn, women earn 77 cents), in the developing world, women experience 
deep deprivation, exploitation, and harm. The following are ten examples of 
 gender inequality globally. 3 
 5.3 Spatial Inequality 
The Global Gender Gap 
 
1.  Women everywhere experience a gender wage gap whether in 
the developed or the developing world. 
 
2.  Women in many parts of the world experience limited mobility 
from not being allowed to drive on public roads to refusing to go 
out by themselves at night for fear of attack or rape. 
 
3.  One in every three women around the world is likely to be 
beaten, coerced into sex, or otherwise abused sometime in her 
lifetime. 
 
4.  In some countries, a male child is more valuable than a female 
child and parents who don't want a girl may either abort the fetus 
or kill the child after birth. 
   5.  In some countries, women are 
legally prohibited from owning 
land. 
   6.  According to the United Nations, 
women do two-thirds of the 
world's work, receive ten percent 
of the world's income and own 
one percent of the means of eco-
nomic production. 
   7.  Women have more limited access 
to health care than men while one 
women dies in childbirth every 
minute of every day. 
   8.  Forced marriages and the lack of 
legal access to divorce limits many 
women's life chances. 
   9.  Despite making up half the 
global population, women hold 
only 15.6 percent of elected 
seats in national parliaments or 
congresses. 
 10.  Women make up more than 
two-thirds of the world's illiterate 
adults.

Language,

on how both 
language and

as well as how they 
spread around the 
world, and how they 
permeate politics 
and social life.
NEW! Spatial Inequality features highlight the growing 
imbalances and inequalities in today's global society relative 
to the chapter's major themes.
 At a very basic level,  literacy  is the ability to read and write. Being able to 
read and write allows us to determine more readily the course of our lives 
as we push beyond simply comprehending language and reproducing it to 
transforming who we are and what we are able to do in the world. UNESCO 
defines literacy as the "ability to identify, understand, interpret, create, com-
municate and compute, using printed and written materials associated 
with varying contexts. Literacy involves a continuum of learning in enabling 
individuals to achieve their goals, to develop their knowledge and potential, 
and to participate fully in their community and wider society." 2 
 In the United States, one of the wealthiest countries on Earth, there 
are 44 million people—many of whom are incarcerated—who are 
  functionally illiterate . Functional illiteracy means that an individual's read-
ing and writing skills are inadequate to manage daily living or hold down a 
job that requires reading skills beyond a basic level.  Figure  6.C is a variation

Structured Learning Path
The Seventh Edition of Human Geography: Places and Regions in Global Context 
provides an active structured learning path to help guide students toward mastery of 
key human geography concepts.
Learning Outcomes in each chapter opener guide 
students through the main learning goals for the 
chapter.
 ■  Explain why populations change, 
where those changes occur, and what 
the implications of population change 
are for the future of different places 
around the globe. 
 ■  Identify the two most important 
 factors in population dynamics, birth 
and death, and how they shape 
 population characteristics. 
 ■  Analyze how geography is a powerful 
force in the incidence of health and 
disease. 
 ■  Demonstrate how the movement of 
populations is affected by both push 
and pull factors, and explain how 
these factors are key to understanding 
new settlement patterns. 
 LEARNING 
OUTCOMES 
 APPLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE 
 1.  What can we learn by studying cultural traits? How does looking 
at cultural complexes help us better understand the relationship 
between humans and the spaces in which they live? 
 2.  Identify two traits that are characteristic of the cultural group to 
which you belong. Are the traits related to the country or region 
in which you live? Describe the relationship or explain why there is 
none. 
UPDATED! Apply Your Knowledge questions are 
integrated throughout the chapter sections, giving 
students a chance to stop and practice/apply their 
understanding. The first of these paired questions is 
now a lower-level knowledge-based reading question, 
while the second is a higher-level application question.
NEW! Active learning questions are now 
included in all boxed features so that students can 
check their understanding as they read.
NEW! The end-of-chapter Data 
Analysis activities feature takes 
students beyond traditional 
review material. Students further 
their understanding as they 
manipulate media, collect data, 
and use interactive mapping.
Learning Outcomes Revisited found at the 
end of each chapter summarizes chapter content 
correlated to the Learning Outcomes stated in 
each chapter opener.
 1.  Look around you both at home and in 
stores. What souvenirs do you find? 
What do they remind you of? What 
geographies—of landscapes, emotions, 
peoples, and travels—do these mate-
rial objects recall for you or for their 
collectors?  
 2.  How else do we connect fact and 
fiction in our daily lives? Think of an 
example of something significant and 
influential that is nevertheless not re-
ally "real." How does this connection 
between fact and fiction influence you? 
Does it shape

 In this chapter we have looked at a central component of 
human-environmental interactions: the geography of food and 
agriculture, from the global to the household and individual 
level. In looking at this basic aspect of life—producing and con-
suming food—the issue of space, economy, and politics play a 
huge role as seen in the debates over the Green 
Revolution, the Biorevolution, food sovereignty, 
anti-GMO resistance movements and the con-
cept of "food deserts." To look closer at how and 
where we produce food, watch the story of Ron 
Finley, a "guerilla gardener" in South  Central Los 
Angeles and answer these questions. ]  
   1.  What does Ron Finley say about fast food  versus drive- by-
shootings in his communities? 
  2.  Why is "food the problem, and food is the solution"? 
  3.  Where in the city does Finley plant his gardens? 
   4.   What is Los Angeles Green Grounds and how do they 
work? 
  5.  How is gardening like art? How does Finley talk about 
soil? 
  6.  How does guerilla gardening change a community? How 
are children a vital component of this process? 
  7.  What does Finley say about flipping the script and making 
gardening "gangster"? 
  8.  Do an Internet search on "guerrilla gardeners." What other 
cities have guerrilla gardener groups? Does your city? 
Would you consider starting a guerilla garden?

LEARNING OUTCOMES REVISITED
 ■  Describe why populations change, where those changes occur, 
and what the implications of population change are for the 
future of different places around the globe. 
 Population geographers bring to demography a special 
 perspective—the spatial perspective—that emphasizes de-
scription and explanation of the "where" of population 
distribution, patterns, and processes.  The distribution of 
population is a result of many factors, such as employment 
opportunities, culture, water supply, climate, and other phys-
ical environment characteristics. Geographers explore these 
patterns of distribution and density, as well as population 
composition in order to comprehend the complex geography 
of populations. Understanding the reasons for and implica-
tions of variation in patterns and composition provides geog-
raphers with insight into population change and the potential 
impacts that growing or declining populations might have
 ■  Demonstrate how the movement of population is affected by 
both push and pull factors and explain how these factors are 
key to understanding new settlement patterns. 
 In general terms, migrants make their decisions to move 
based on push factors and pull factors. Remember that 
push factors  are events and conditions that impel an in-
dividual to move from a location. Pull factors  are forces of 
attraction that influence migrants to move to a particular 
location. Mobility is the capacity to move from one place 
to another, either permanently or temporarily. Migration, 
in contrast, is an actual long-distance move to a new loca-
tion. Permanent and temporary changes of residence can 
occur for a variety of reasons. Striving for economic better-
ment or escaping from adverse political conditions, such 
as war or oppression, are the most frequent causes. Push 
factors can produce forced migration but it is usually the

The racial and ethnic composition of the United States has 
steadily become more diverse - a result of immigration and 
differential birth rates. Studies of racial segregation within U.S.
metropolitan areas have found that, overall, the degree of segre-
gation peaked between 1960 and 1970. Between 1980 and 2010
racial segregation declined, but at a very slow pace. In 2010 the
average white person in metropolitan America lived in a neigh
ed in a neigh-
borhood that was 75 percent white, while the average African 
American lived in a neighborhood that was only 35 percent white 
and as much as 45 percent black. Hispanics and Asians are
considerably less segregated than African Americans, and their
segregation levels have remained steady for several decades. In
addition, since both these groups are growing, there is a 
tendency for their neighborhoods to become more homoge-
neous. As a result, these groups live in more isolated settings 
now than they did in the 1980s.

In Atlanta, there is a simple north-south division, with whites
(and a few enclaves of Asians) in the northern half of the
metro area, and African Americans in the southern half.
1. Why do you think racial groups are more mixed in some cities, 
compared to others? Compare historical factors (civil rights movement,
WWII, American Indian relocation) and immigration polices with what
you have learned.
2. Analyze the demographic concept of "minority-majority" geographies
by doing an Internet search on "minority-majority cities/counties/states."
Where are these cities/counties/states located and what do you observe
about the political aﬃliations, immigration policies, social programs and
economy compared to white majority areas?
 11.3 Window on the World 
 The Pearl River Delta ( Figure  11.E ) is one of the fastest-growing urban 
regions in the world. Anchored by the major metropolitan centers of 
Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Macau, Shenzhen, and Zhuhai, it is an extended 
metropolitan region of nearly 50 million people. It is one of three extended 
metropolitan regions—Beijing-Tianjin and Shanghai are the others—that 
have been fostered by the Chinese government to be engines of capitalist 
growth since liberal economic reforms were introduced in the late 1970s.  
 Hong Kong ( Figure  11.F ) was a British colony until 1997. It is now a me-
tropolis of 7.4 million with a thriving industrial and commercial base that is 
recognized as a capitalist economic dynamo by the Chinese government, 
which has created a Special Administrative District for the metropolis. As a re-
sult, Hong Kong's citizens have retained their British-based legal system and its 
guaranteed rights of property ownership and democracy. Hong Kong is the 
world's largest container port, the third-largest center for foreign exchange 
trade, the seventh-largest stock market, and the tenth-largest trading economy.  
 Hong Kong's financial success encouraged the Chinese government to 
establish two of its first Special Economic Zones (SEZs) in nearby Shenzhen 
and Zhuhai. Designed to attract foreign capital, technology, and manage-
ment practices, these SEZs were established as export-processing zones that 
offered cheap labor and land, along with tax breaks, to transnational cor-
porations. Investors from Hong Kong and Taiwan responded quickly and 
enthusiastically. By 1993, more than 15,000 manufacturers from Hong Kong 
alone had set up businesses in Guangdong Province, and a similar number 
had established subcontracting relationships, contracting out assembly-line 
work to Chinese companies in the Pearl River Delta. Meanwhile, the Chinese 
government designated the entire delta region an Open Economic Region, 
where local governments, individual enterprises, and farm households enjoy 
a high degree of autonomy in economic decision making. 
 The relaxation of state control over the regional economy allowed the 
region's dense and growing rural population to migrate to urban areas in 
search of assembly-line jobs or to stay in rural areas and diversify agricultural 
production from paddy-rice cultivation to more profitable activities such as

 ▲  Figure 11.E  Pearl River Delta One of the fastest-growing regions of the 
world, the Pearl River Delta is an extended metropolitan region of more than 
50 million people. 
 ▲   Figure 11.F  The City of Hong Kong The city is home to thousands 
of companies located there simply for the purpose of doing business with 
China. As a result, Hong Kong remains a major world city—a major financial 
hub with a thriving commercial sector and a population of 7.4 million. 
market-farming activities, livestock husbandry, and fishery. Economic freedom 
also facilitated rural industrialization—mostly low-tech, small-scale, labor-
intensive, and widely scattered across the countryside. The 
area between Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Macau has quickly 
emerged as an especially important zone because of its rela-
tively cheap land and labor and because of significant levels of 
investment by regional and local governments in the transport 
and communications infrastructure ( Figure  11.G ).  
 The metropolitan cores of the region, aiming to increase 
their competitiveness and prominence in the globalizing world 
economy, have invested heavily in infrastructure improvements. 
The Guangzhou municipal government, for example, invested 
more than $10 billion between 1998 and 2004 in infrastructure 
construction—including a metro system and an elevated railway 
network to link the city's new international airport, railway sta-
tions, and port. Throughout the region, enormous investments 
have been made in showpiece infrastructure projects geared to 
the needs of local and international capital. These include major 
airports, high-speed tolled highways, satellite ground stations, 
port installations, metro and light-rail networks, and new water-
management systems. In turn, these projects have attracted 
business and technology parks, financial centers, and resort 
complexes in a loose-knit sprawl of urban development. 
 Today, the Pearl River Delta provides a thriving export-
processing platform that has driven double-digit annual 
economic growth for much of the past two decades. The 
region's GDP grew from just over US$8 billion in 1980 to 
nearly US$270 billion in 2010. During that period, the 
 average real rate of GDP growth in the Pearl River Delta 
Economic Zone exceeded 16 percent, well above the 
People's Republic of China national figure of 9.8 percent. 
By 2010 and with only 3.5 percent of the country's popula-
tion, the region was contributing 10 percent of the coun-
try's GDP and 29 percent of its total trade. 
 Guangzhou is a megacity with a 2010 population of 
around 10 million ( Figure  11.H ). Shenzhen has grown from 
a population of just 19,000 in 1975 to 8.1 million in 2010, 
with an additional 2 million in the surrounding municipalities. 
The southern border of the Shenzhen Special  Economic 
Zone adjoins Hong Kong, but the northern border is walled 
off from the rest of China by an electrified fence to prevent 
smuggling and to keep back the mass of people trying to 
migrate illegally into Shenzhen and Hong Kong.

2.  Can you identify any other megacities that have experienced 
similar economic success?

 1.1 Geography Mat ers 
 Since the advent of steam locomotives and the telegraph, there have 
been countless predictions about how technology will put an end to the 
constraints of geography. Some believe that that day has finally come.  The 
Economist  magazine proclaimed the "death of distance" in 1995 ( http://
www.economist.com/node/598895 ). A decade later,  The New York Times  
 columnist Tom Friedman proclaimed The World Is Flat (Farrar, Straus,  Giroux, 
2005). Between airplanes, the Internet, social media, and smart phones, 
the argument goes, the distances that once separated us have contracted 
to nothing; no matter where we live, we can all work and compete on the 
same terms.  
 But dig a little deeper and you'll realize that place and geography matter 
more today than they ever did. And not just in some abstract academic way, 
but in your daily lives.  
 Why Where Matters 
 We tend to focus on two big decisions:  who  we choose as our life part-
ner and  what  we do for work. But there is a third big decision—where 
you choose to live. The decision about  where  may be the most impor-
tant, because it has a huge bearing on the others (Richard Florida,  Who's 
Your City.  Basic Books, 2008) .  
 Where you choose to live affects every aspect of your being. It in-
fluences the income you can potentially earn, and how far you can de-
velop your skills. It has a bearing on the friends and romantic partners 
you can potentially meet, the networks you can build, and the options 
that will be available to your children. It shapes your values and your 
politics. It plays a role in how happy and healthy you are, and in your 
overall quality of life. 
 It's something of a paradox. As globalized as we may be, wealth and 
power are more concentrated and clustered than ever before. Location 
matters. It is true that communications are instantaneous and journeys that 
used to take months now take only hours, but the key factors that determine 
whether a place prospers are unevenly distributed; some are much more 
endowed with them than others.  
 Welcome to the Spiky World 
 When we overlay graphs of economic output, population, and innovation 
on a map, some places, especially those in the United States, Western 
 Europe, and Asia, tower over the rest. Just look at the level of innovation in 
Tokyo! The world is anything but flat; it is spiky (  Figure  1.A  ).  
 Those high levels of innovation and a disproportionate share of the 
world's economic activity occur in the geographic clusters called mega-re-
gions—galaxy-like clusters of cities and their suburbs that grow and evolve 
into coherent geographic entities. These include great Bos-Wash (Boston-
New York-Washington) Corridor, which would rank as the world's fourth 
largest economy, behind the United States itself and China and Japan; Am-
Bruss-Twerp spanning Amsterdam, Antwerp and Brussels; and the area that 
runs from London to Leeds, Manchester, Liverpool, and Birmingham. All told, 
the globe's 40 leading mega-regions produce two-thirds of the world's eco-
nomic output and nine in ten of its technological innovations, while housing 
less than one in five of its people.

 Urban Planet 
 Big cities have become the core social and economic organizing units of our time, 
replacing the farm and the factory of previous epochs. As the great urbanist Jane 
Jacobs was perhaps the first to document in her book  The Economy of Cities  (Ran-
dom House, 1969), big cities are cauldrons of innovation; when diverse people 
live and work in close quarters, they come up with new ideas that improve the 
productivity of existing industries and generate new ones.  
 This geographic clustering of diverse and talented people is what makes 
cities different than all other biological and social organisms. Typically when 
organisms get bigger their metabolisms slow down. But as cities get larger 
and larger their "urban metabolism"—measured variously as their economic 
activity or ability to innovate—speeds up. (Bettencourt, Lobo, et al., " Growth, 
Innovation, Scaling, and the Pace of Life in Cities ,"  Proceedings of the National 
Academy of Sciences of the United States of America ,  http://www.pnas.org/
content/104/17/7301.full ). 
 The geographic clustering of people will only grow. Over the course of 
the next century, the world's urban populations are projected to increase by 
as many as 5 billion people. Most of that will be happening in the rapidly 
urbanizing areas of South East Asia and Africa. To accommodate them, exist-
ing cities will expand substantially and hundreds of cities are likely to emerge 
( http://marroninstitute.nyu.edu/content/working-papers/urbanization-as-op-
portunity1 ). Ensuring that those cities are vibrant, sustainable, and functional 
will be the grandest of the grand challenges humanity will ever face. Our 
success or failure will have a bearing on everything from our ability to miti-
gate poverty and climate change to how successfully the world continues to 
democratize.  
 Distance is not dead and geography is far from over. The fact is, place 
matters more today than it ever has.  
 Richard Florida is director of the Martin Prosperity Institute at the  University 
of Toronto's Rotman School of Management, Global Research Professor at 
New York University, and senior editor at The Atlantic, where he cofounded 
CityLab.   
 
1.  Use the online "Place Finder" tool ( http://www.creativeclass.
com/_v3/whos_your_city/place_finder/ ) to identify the city that is 
best suited to you. Come up with three to five cities you think you 
might want to live and work in and then use the Place Finder tool 
to rate and rank them. Which is your best city and why? 
 
2.  According to   Figure  1.B  , neighboring cities in the orange colored 
areas are growing into large mega-regions. Some of these even cross 
national boundaries and in some respects have more in common 
with each other than their respective countries. Is it possible that city 
regions will become more significant units of place than nation states?

Preface
A nation, like a person, has a mind—a mind that must be  
kept informed and alert, that must know itself, that 
 under stands the hopes and needs of its neighbors—all  
the other nations that live within the narrowing circle  
of the world.
Franklin Roosevelt, Third Inaugural Address, 
Monday, January 20, 1941
Most people have an understanding of what their own lives are 
like and know a good deal about their own neighborhood and 
perhaps even something of the larger city and state in which they 
live. Yet, even as the countries and regions of the world become 
more interconnected, most of us still know very little about the 
lives of people on the other side of our country, or in other socie-
ties, or about the ways the lives of those people connect to our 
own. To change the world, to make it a better place for all peo-
ple, we need to understand not just our little corner of it, but the 
whole of it—the broad sweep of human geography that consti-
tutes the larger world of which our small corners are just a part.
This book provides an introduction to human geography 
that will help young men and women to understand critically 
the world in which they live. To study human geography, to put 
it simply, is to study the dynamic and complex relationships 
between peoples and the worlds they inhabit. Our book gives 
students the basic geographical tools and concepts needed to 
understand the complexity of places and regions, and to appre-
ciate the interconnections between their own lives and those 
of people in different parts of the world—to make the world a 
better place.
NEW TO THE SEVENTH EDITION
The seventh edition of Places and Regions in Global Context 
represents a thorough revision. Every part of the book was 
examined carefully with the goal of keeping topics and data 
current while also improving the clarity of the text and the 
graphics. We have also sought to enhance the utility of the 
book for both instructors and students.
■ A new chapter (Chapter 6) on Language, Communication, 
and Belief gives a greater focus on how both language and 
religion reflect and influence societies, as well as how they 
spread around the world, and how they permeate politics 
and social life.
■ Spatial Inequality features highlight the growing imbal-
ances and inequalities in today's global society relative to 
the chapter's major themes.
■ The reimagined Geography Matters features, authored by 
expert contributors from the community, present contem-
porary research and hot topics in geography subfields.
■ Data Analysis activities at the end of each chapter give stu-
dents the chance to put their understanding of key themes 
in the chapter into practice. Students further their under-
standing as they manipulate media, collect data, and use 
interactive mapping.
■ Newly redesigned Visualizing Geography features consist-
ently incorporate edgy, modern applications and visualiza-
tions of current spatial data.
■ Active learning assessments are now included in all boxed 
features so that students can check their understanding.
■ The seventh edition also incorporates a comprehensive 
updating of all of the data, maps, photographs, and illus-
trative examples.
■ We have added or expanded upon quite a few topics, 
including climate change and issues of sustainability; ris-
ing sea levels; spatial inequality; gender and economic 
development; place, space and scale; landscape and art; 
cultural heritage; urban regeneration; and urban environ-
mental problems; conflict zones; changing demographic 
issues; food, health and place; gender and sexuality; and 
what the near future is likely to be. These changes are 
designed to ensure that we offer the most up-to-date cover-
age in the field of human geography.
■ A renewed focus on fundamentals gives students access 
not only to the new ideas, concepts, and theories that 
address the changes mentioned earlier in this text, but 
also to the fundamentals of human geography: the prin-
ciples, concepts, theoretical frameworks, and basic 
knowledge.
■ Over 150 new Geography Videos from the BBC and the 
Financial Times are now included in MasteringGeography. 
Students can access the videos on their own in the Study 
Area, and teachers can assign the videos with assessment 
activities.
■ Learning Catalytics™ is a "bring your own device" student 
engagement, assessment, and classroom intelligence system.

OBJECTIVE & APPROACH
The objective of the book is to introduce the study of human 
geography by providing not only a body of knowledge about 
the creation of places and regions, but also an understanding 
of the interdependence of places and regions in a globalizing 
world. The approach is aimed at establishing an intellectual 
foundation that will enable a lifelong and life-sustaining geo-
graphical imagination: an essential tool for today's students 
in order to confront tomorrow's global, national, regional, and  
local challenges.
The book takes a fresh approach to human geography, 
reflecting the major changes that have recently been impressed 
on global, regional, and local landscapes. These changes 
include the globalization of industry and the related rapid rise 
of China and India as economic powerhouses, the upwelling 
of ethnic regionalisms on the heels of decolonization and the 
formation of new states, the movement of peoples around the 
world in search of better lives, the physical restructuring of 
cities, the transformation of traditional agricultural practices 
throughout much of the world, global environmental change 
and the movement for sustainability, the eruptions of war and 
the struggles for peace, and the emerging trend toward trans-
national political and economic organizations. The approach 
used in Places and Regions in Global Context provides access 
not only to the new ideas, concepts, and theories that address 
these changes, but also to the fundamentals of human geog-
raphy: the principles, concepts, theoretical frameworks, 
and basic knowledge that are necessary to more specialized 
studies.
The most distinctive feature of this approach is that it 
emphasizes the interdependence of both places and processes 
in different parts of the globe. In overall terms, this approach is 
designed to provide an understanding of relationships between 
global processes and the local places in which they unfold. It fol-
lows that one of the chief organizing principles is how globali-
zation frames the social and cultural construction of particular 
places and regions. This approach has several advantages. For 
example:
■ It captures aspects of human geography that are among 
the most compelling in the contemporary world—the geo-
graphical bases of cultural diversity and their impacts on 
everyday life.
■ It encompasses the salient aspects of new emphases in aca-
demic human geography—the new emphasis on sustainabil-
ity and its role in the social construction of spaces and places.
■ It makes for an easier marriage between topical and regional 
material by emphasizing how processes link them—tech-
nological innovation and the varying ways technology is 
adopted and modified by people in particular places.
■ It facilitates meaningful comparisons between places in 
different parts of the world—how the core-generated in-
dustrialization of agriculture shapes gender relations in 
households both in the core and the periphery.
In short, the textbook is designed to focus on geographical 
processes and to provide an understanding of the interdepend-
ence among places and regions without losing sight of their 
individuality and uniqueness.
Several important themes are woven into each chapter, 
integrating them into the overall approach:
■ the relationship between global processes and their local 
manifestations;
■ the interdependence of people and places, especially the 
interactive relationships between core regions and periph-
eral regions;
■ the continuing transformation of the political economy 
of the world system, and of nations, regions, cities, and 
localities;
■ the social and cultural differences that are embedded in 
human geographies (especially the differences that relate 
to race, ethnicity, gender, age, and class).
CHAPTER ORGANIZATION
The organization of the book is innovative in several ways. 
First, the chapters are organized so that the conceptual frame-
work—why geography matters in a globalizing world—is laid 
out in Chapters 1 and 2 and then deployed in thematic chapters 
(Chapters 3 through 12). Second, the conceptual framework of 
the book requires the inclusion of two introductory chapters 
rather than the usual one. The first describes the basics of a 
geographic perspective; the second explains the value of the 
globalization approach.
Third, the distinctive chapter ordering within the book fol-
lows the logic of moving from less complex to more complex 
systems of human social and economic organization, always 
highlighting the interaction between people and the world 
around them. The first thematic chapter (Chapter 3) focuses 
on human population. Its early placement in the book reflects 
the central importance of people in understanding geography. 
Chapter 4 deals with the relationship between people and the 
environment as it is mediated by technology. This chapter 
explores human-environment relations and establishes a cen-
tral theme: that all human geographical issues are about how 
people negotiate their environment—whether the natural or 
the built environment.
The chapter on nature, society, and technology is followed 
by Chapter 5 on cultural geography. The intention in position-
ing the cultural chapter here is to signal that culture is the 
primary medium through which people operate and under-
stand their place in the world. Chapter 6, new to this edition, 
gives a focus on how both language and religion reflect and  
influence societies, as well as how they spread around the world, 
and how they permeate politics and social life. In Chapter 7,

The pedagogy of the book employs four different boxed 
features—"Geography Matters," "Visualizing Geography," 
"Spatial Inequality," and "Window on the World."
Geography Matters features, authored by expert guest contrib-
utors, show how geographers are using their unique perspec-
tives and contemporary geographic tools to solve real-world 
problems, emphasizing how geography and the geographic 
method matter in the world today.
Visualizing Geography boxes treat key concepts of the chapter 
through modern applications and visualizations of data, help-
ing students "see" the ways geography shapes their daily lives.
Spatial Inequality features highlight the growing imbalances 
and inequalities in today's global society relative to the chap-
ter's major themes.
Window on the World boxes take a key concept and explore 
its application in a particular location. This feature allows 
students to appreciate the relevance of geographic concepts 
to world events and brings far-flung places closer to their 
comprehension.
These features are explored through each chapter's learn-
ing path, which guides the reader through each chapter's 
themes, starting with the Learning Outcomes at the start of 
each chapter, and continuing with each Apply Your Knowl-
edge question pairing to ensure a student's understanding of 
key elements of each section. Every chapter includes Future 
Geographies, which details what global and local elements 
may take shape in the years ahead. We conclude each chap-
ter with Learning Outcomes Revisited, designed to encapsulate 
the imperative elements of the chapter's narrative.
CONCLUSION
The idea for this book evolved from conversations between the 
authors and colleagues about how to teach human geography in 
colleges and universities. Our intent was to find a way not only 
to capture the exciting changes that are rewriting the world's 
landscapes and reorganizing the spatial relationships between 
people but also to demonstrate convincingly why the study of 
geography matters. Our aim was to show why a geographical 
imagination is important, how it can lead to an understanding 
of the world and its constituent places and regions, and how it 
has practical relevance in many spheres of life.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
We are indebted to many people for their assistance, advice, 
and constructive criticism in the course of preparing this book. 
Among those who provided comments on drafts of the various 
editions of this book are the following professors:
David Aagesen (SUNY: Geneseo)
Christopher A. Airriess (Ball State University)
Stuart Aitken (University of California at San Diego)
Matthew Anderson (Montana State University, Billings)
Kevin Archer (University of South Florida)
Sarah Bednarz (Texas A&M University)
the impact of cultural processes on the landscape is explored, 
together with the ways in which landscape shapes cultural 
processes.
In Chapter 8, the book begins the move toward more 
complex concepts and systems of human organization by  
concentrating on economic development. The focus of  
Chapter 9 is agriculture. The placement of agriculture after 
economic development reflects the overall emphasis on 
globalization. This chapter shows how processes of globali-
zation and economic development have led to the industri-
alization of agriculture at the expense of more traditional 
agricultural systems and practices.
The final three thematic chapters cover political geogra-
phy (Chapter 10), urbanization (Chapter 11), and city structure 
(Chapter 12). Devoting two chapters to urban geography, rather 
than a more conventional single chapter, is an important indi-
cation of how globalization increasingly leads to urbanization 
of the world's people and places.
Features
The hallmark feature of our book is the global framework that 
promotes a strong connection between topical and regional 
material by emphasizing how their processes are linked (e.g., 
technological innovation and the varying ways technology is 
adopted and modified by people and places). This makes for a 
contemporary approach to human geography, reflecting many 
trends in the discipline, such as the globalization of industry, 
the upwelling of ethnic regionalisms on the heels of decolo-
nization and new state formation, and the trend toward trans-
national political and economic organizations. The global 
framework also facilitates meaningful comparisons between 
people and places in different parts of the world, such as how 
the core-generated industrialization of agriculture shapes gen-
der relations in households, both in the core and in the periph-
ery. It allows us to present the relevant aspects of different 
emphases in academic human geography (e.g., geopolitics and 
its role in the social construction of spaces and places). At the 
same time, a focus on fundamentals gives students access not 
only to the new ideas, concepts, and theories that address the 
changes mentioned earlier in this text but also to the funda-
mentals of human geography: the principles, concepts, theo-
retical frameworks, and basic knowledge. The book's thematic 
structure weaves several important themes into every chap-
ter: the interdependence of people and places, especially the 
interactive relationships between the core and the periphery; 
social and cultural differences that are embedded in human 
geographies, especially the differences that relate to race, eth-
nicity, gender, age, and class; the relationship between global 
processes and their local manifestations; and the continuing 
transformation of the political economy of the world system 
and nations, regions, cities, and localities.
To signal the freshness of the approach, the book features a 
superior cartographic program, consisting of rich, diverse, and 
fully updated maps that help professors better teach their stu-
dents the important spatial elements inherent to human geog-
raphy. The cartography program features numerous compound 
figures that combine maps with photographs and line drawings.

GEOGRAPHY 
MATTERS
1
In Buenos Aires, Argentina, rioting teenagers ransacked and 
robbed working-class neighborhood grocery stores in 2012, leaving 22 dead 
and more than 200 injured. It was one of more than 50 riots worldwide be-
tween 2007 and 2014 where food was the principal issue.1 The problem of 
food shortages and rising food prices in Argentina and in many other places 
is a reflection of the increasing geographic interdependence of the world. The 
situation is partly the result of increasing food consumption in other parts of 
the world, especially in booming China and India, where many have stopped 
growing their own food and have the cash to buy a lot more of it. Increasing 
meat consumption has helped drive up demand for feed grain, and this in turn 
has driven up the price of grain everywhere. Speculators in international com-
modity markets have joined the fray, further accelerating price rises. Another 
key linkage concerns energy prices: High oil prices push up fertilizer prices, 
while the cost of transporting food from farm to market adds to food costs. 
The popularity of biofuels as an alternative to hydrocarbons is straining food 
supplies, especially in the United States, where generous federal subsidies 
for ethanol have lured farmers away from growing crops for food. Compound-
ing all this is climate change. Harvests in many countries have been seriously 
disrupted by more frequent extreme weather events. In 2013-2014, there were 
prolonged droughts in Argentina, California, eastern Brazil, Texas, parts of 
the Mediterranean, and the Sahel region of Africa; catastrophic floods in Can-
ada and Central Europe; severe hailstorms in Germany; and a record-breaking  
typhoon that killed more than 6,000 in the Philippines.
Human geography is about recognizing and understanding the interdepen-
dence among places and regions, without losing sight of the uniqueness of 
each specific place. Places are specific geographic settings with distinctive 
physical, social, and cultural attributes. Regions are territories that encompass 
1The World Bank Group, Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Network, Food Price 
Watch, 17, Washington, D.C., May 2014.

HUMAN GEOGRAPHY   Places and Regions in Global Context
many places, all or most of which share attributes dif-
ferent from the attributes of places elsewhere. Maps are 
also important tools for introducing geographers' ideas 
about the way that places and regions are made and 
altered.
WHY GEOGRAPHY MATTERS
The importance of geography as a subject of study is becoming 
more widely recognized as people everywhere struggle to un-
derstand a world that is increasingly characterized by instant 
global communications, rapidly changing international rela-
tionships, unexpected local changes, and growing evidence of 
environmental degradation. Many more schools now require 
courses in geography than just a decade ago, and the College 
Board has added the subject to its Advanced Placement pro-
gram. Meanwhile, many employers are coming to realize the 
value of employees with expertise in geographical analysis 
and an understanding of the uniqueness, influence, and inter-
dependence of places. Through an appreciation of the diver-
sity and variety of the world's peoples and places, geography 
provides real opportunities not only to contribute to local, na-
tional, and global development but also to understand and pro-
mote multicultural, international, and feminist perspectives in 
the world.
Most people want to understand the intrinsic nature of 
the world in which we live. Geography enables us to under-
stand where we are both literally and figuratively. Geography 
provides knowledge of Earth's physical and human systems 
and of the interdependency of living things and physical en-
vironments. That knowledge, in turn, provides a basis for 
people to cooperate in the best interests of our planet. Ge-
ography also captures the imagination: It stimulates curios-
ity about the world and the world's diverse inhabitants and 
places. By obtaining a better understanding of the world, 
people can overcome closed-mindedness, prejudice, and 
discrimination.
APPLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE
1. Why do you think studying geography is critical in today's world?
2. Give two examples of how one can use geographical knowledge in 
any one of these fields: advertising, marketing, or human resource 
development. 
WHY PLACES MATTER
An appreciation of the diversity and variety of peoples and 
places is a theme that runs through all of human geography, 
the study of the spatial organization of human activity and of 
people's relationships with their environments. This theme 
is inherently interesting to nearly all of us. National Geo-
graphic magazine has become a venerable institution by bring-
ing us monthly updates of the seemingly endless variety of 
landscapes and communities around the world. More than  
5 million households, representing about 19 million regular 
readers, subscribe to this magazine for its intriguing descrip-
tions and striking photographs. Millions more read it occasion-
ally in offices, lobbies, waiting rooms, or online.
Yet many Americans often seem content to confine their 
interest in geography to the pages of glossy magazines, to tele-
vision documentaries, or to one-week packaged vacations. 
It has become part of the conventional wisdom—both in the 
United States and around the world—that many Americans 
have little real appreciation or understanding of people and 
places beyond their own daily routines. This is perhaps put-
ting it too mildly. Surveys have revealed widespread igno-
rance among a high proportion of Americans, not only of the 
fundamentals of the world's geography but also of the diver-
sity and variety within the United States itself. In surveys of 
young adults in Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, 
Japan, Mexico, Sweden, and the United States, Americans 
come in next to last in terms of geographic literacy. Neither 
wars nor natural disasters appear to have compelled the ma-
jority of young Americans to absorb knowledge about interna-
tional places in the news.
So although most people in the United States are fasci-
nated by different places, relatively few have a systematic 
knowledge of them. Fewer still understand how different 
places came to be the way they are or why places matter in the 
broader scheme of things. This lack of understanding is unfor-
tunate because geographic knowledge can take us far beyond a 
simple glimpse of the inherently interesting variety of peoples 
and places.
The Influence of Places
Places are dynamic, with changing properties and fluid bound-
aries that are the product of the interplay of a wide variety of 
environmental and human factors. This dynamism and com-
plexity is what makes places so fascinating for readers of  
National Geographic. It is also what makes places so important 
in shaping people's lives and in influencing the pace and di-
rection of change. Places provide the settings for people's daily 
lives and their social relations (patterns of interaction among 
family members, at work, in social life, in leisure activities, 
and in political activity). It is in these settings that people learn 
who and what they are, how they are expected to think and 
behave, and what life is likely to hold for them.
Places exert a strong influence, for better or worse, on peo-
ple's physical well-being, opportunities, and lifestyle choices. 
Living in a small town dominated by petrochemical industries, 
for example, means a higher probability of being exposed to air 
and water pollution, having a limited range of job opportuni-
ties, and having a relatively narrow range of lifestyle options 
because of a lack of amenities such as theatres, specialized 
stores and restaurants, and recreational facilities (Figure 1.1). 
Living in a central neighborhood of a large metropolitan area, 
on the other hand, usually means having a wider range of job 
opportunities and a greater choice of lifestyle options because 
of the variety of amenities accessible within a short distance 
(Figure 1.2). But it also means, among other things, living with 
a relatively high exposure to crime.

CHAPTER 1   Geography Matters   31
The Meaning of Places
Places also contribute to people's collective memory and be-
come powerful emotional and cultural symbols. Consider 
the evocative power for most Americans of places like Times 
Square in New York; the Mall in Washington, D.C.; Hollywood 
Boulevard in Los Angeles; and Graceland in Memphis. And for 
many people, ordinary places have special meaning: a child-
hood neighborhood, a college campus, a baseball stadium, 
or a family vacation spot. This layering of meanings reflects 
the way that places are socially constructed—given different 
meanings by different groups for different purposes. Places ex-
ist and are constructed by their inhabitants from a subjective 
point of view.
The meanings given to a place may be so strong that they 
become a central part of the identity of the people experienc-
ing them. Your identity is the sense that you make of yourself 
through your subjective feelings based on your everyday ex-
periences and social relations. Your own neighborhood, for 
example, is probably heavily laden with personal meaning 
and sentiment for you. But your neighborhood may well be 
viewed very differently, perhaps unsympathetically, by outsid-
ers. This distinction is useful in considering the importance 
of understanding spaces and places from the viewpoint of the  
insider—the person who normally lives in and uses a  particular 
place—as well as from the viewpoint of outsiders (including 
geographers).
Finally, places are the sites of innovation and change, of 
resistance and conflict (Figure 1.3). The unique  characteristics 
of specific places can provide the preconditions for new  
agricultural practices (such as the development of seed agri-
culture and the use of plow and draft animals that sparked the 
first agricultural revolution in the Middle East in prehistoric 
times—see Chapter 9); new modes of economic organization 
(such as the high-tech revolution that began in Silicon Valley

Boston.

development.

in the late twentieth century); new cultural practices (e.g., the 
punk movement that began in disadvantaged British housing 
projects); and new lifestyles (e.g., the hippie lifestyle that be-
gan in San Francisco in the late 1960s). It is in specific locales 
that important events happen, and it is from them that signifi-
cant changes spread.
Nevertheless, the influence of places is by no means limited 
to the occasional innovative change. Because of their distinc-
tive characteristics, places always modify and sometimes resist 
the imprint of even the broadest economic, cultural, and politi-
cal trends. Consider, for example, the way that a global cultural 
trend—rock 'n' roll—was modified in Jamaica to produce reggae. 
And how in Iran and North Korea rock 'n' roll has been resisted 
by the authorities, with the result that it has acquired an alto-
gether different kind of value and meaning for the citizens of 
those countries. Similarly, Indian communities in London de-
veloped Bhangra—a "world beat" composite of traditional Pun-
jabi music, Bollywood (Hindi) movie scores, and Western disco. 
Cross-fertilization with local music cultures in New York and 
Los Angeles has produced Bhangra rap.
To consider a different illustration, think of the ways some 
communities have declared themselves "nuclear-free" zones: 
places where nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors are un-
welcome or even banned by local laws. By establishing such 
zones, individual communities are seeking to challenge trends 
toward using nuclear energy and maintaining nuclear arms. 
They are, to borrow a phrase, "thinking globally and acting 
locally." Similarly, some communities have established "GM-
free" zones, taking a stance against genetically modified crops 
and food. In adopting such strategies, they hope to influence 
thinking in other communities so that eventually their chal-
lenge could result in a reversal of established trends.
In summary, places are settings for social interaction that, 
among other things,
■ structure the daily routines of people's economic and  
social life;
■ provide both opportunities and constraints in terms of 
people's long-term social well-being;
■ provide a context in which everyday, commonsense 
knowledge and experience are gathered;
■ provide a setting for processes of socialization; and
■ provide an arena for contesting social norms.

STUDYING HUMAN GEOGRAPHY
The study of geography involves the study of Earth as cre-
ated by natural forces and modified by human action. This, of 
course, covers an enormous amount of subject matter. There 
are two main branches of geography: physical and human. 
Physical geography deals with Earth's natural processes and 
their outcomes. It is concerned, for example, with climate, 
weather patterns, landforms, soil formation, and plant and 
animal ecology. Human geography deals with the spatial  
organization of human activities and with people's relation-
ships to their environments. This involves looking at natural 
physical environments insofar as they influence, and are in-
fluenced by, human activity. To that end, the study of human 
geography must cover a wide variety of phenomena. These in-
clude, for example, agricultural production and food security, 
population change, the ecology of human diseases, resource 
management, environmental pollution, regional planning, and 
the symbolism of places and landscapes.
Regional geography combines elements of both physical 
and human geography. Regional geography is concerned with the 
way that unique combinations of environmental and human fac-
tors produce territories with distinctive landscapes and cultural

attributes. The concept of region is used by geographers to ap-
ply to larger-sized territories that encompass many neighboring 
places, all or most of which have similar attributes distinct from 
the attributes of other places.
Geographical Relationships
What is distinctive about the study of human geography is not 
so much the phenomena that are studied as the way they are ap-
proached. The contribution of human geography is to reveal how 
and why geographical relationships are important in relation to 
a wide spectrum of natural, social, economic, political, and cul-
tural phenomena. Thus, for example, human geographers are in-
terested not only in patterns of agricultural production but also 
in the geographical relationships and interdependencies that are 
both causes and effects of such patterns. To put it in concrete 
terms, geographers are interested not only in what specialized 
agricultural subregions (e.g., the dairy farming area of Jutland, 
Denmark) are like but also in the role of subregions such as Jut-
land in national and international agro-food systems (their in-
terdependence with producers, distributors, and consumers in 
other places and regions—see Chapter 8).
Geography is to a great extent an applied discipline as 
well as a means of understanding the world. Geographers 
employed in business, industry, and government are able to 
use geographic theories and techniques to understand and 
solve a wide variety of specific problems. A great deal of the 
research undertaken by geography professors has an applied 
focus.
THE BASIC TOOLS AND 
METHODS OF HUMAN 
GEOGRAPHERS
In general terms, the basic tools employed in 
geography are similar to those in other dis-
ciplines. Like other social scientists, human 
geographers usually begin with observation. In-
formation must be collected and data recorded. 
This can involve many different methods and 
tools. Fieldwork (surveying, asking questions, 
using scientific instruments to measure and 
record things), laboratory experiments, and 
archival searches all are used by human geog-
raphers to gather information about geographi-
cal relationships. Geographers also use remote 
sensing, the collection of information about 
parts of Earth's surface by means of aerial pho-
tography or satellite imagery designed to record 
data on visible, infrared, and microwave sensor 
systems (Figure 1.4). For example, agricultural 
productivity can be monitored by remotely 
sensed images of crops, and energy efficiency 
can be monitored by remotely sensed levels of 
heat loss from buildings.
Once data have been obtained through some form of obser-
vation, the next important step is to portray and describe them 
through visualization or representation. This can involve a va-
riety of tools, including written descriptions, charts, diagrams, 
tables, mathematical formulas, and maps (see Box 1.2: "Visu-
alizing Geography: Maps"). Visualization and representation 
are important activities because they allow large amounts of 
information to be explored, summarized, and presented to 
others. They are nearly always a first step in the analysis of 
geographical relationships, and they are important in convey-
ing the findings and conclusions of geographic research.
At the heart of geographic research, as with other kinds of re-
search, is the analysis of data. The objective of analysis, whether 
of quantitative or qualitative data, is to discover patterns and es-
tablish relationships so that hypotheses can be established and 
models can be built. Models, in this sense, are abstractions of 
reality that help explain the real world. They require tools that 
allow us to generalize about things. Once again, we find that 
geographers are like other social scientists in that they utilize a 
wide range of analytical tools, including conceptual and linguis-
tic devices, maps, charts, and mathematical equations.
In many ways, therefore, the tools and methods of human 
 geographers are parallel to those used in other sciences, especially 
the social sciences. In addition, geographers increasingly use some 
of the tools and methods of the humanities—interpretive analysis 
and inductive reasoning, for example—together with ethnographic 
research (the systematic recording of human cultures) and textual 
analysis. One of the most distinctive tools in the geographer's kit 
bag is geographic information systems (GIS).
▲ Figure 1.4 Remotely sensed images Remotely sensed images can provide new ways of 
seeing the world, as well as unique sources of data on all sorts of environmental conditions. Such 
images can help explain problems and processes. Aerial photographs, for example, can be helpful 
in explaining what would otherwise require expensive surveys and detailed cartography. They 
are especially useful in working with multidisciplinary teams. This example shows the lower Con-
necticut River near the town of Old Lyme. The photograph was taken during the Connecticut 
River Marsh Restoration Project.

HUMAN GEOGRAPHY   Places and Regions in Global Context
1.1 Geography Maters 
Since the advent of steam locomotives and the telegraph, there have 
been countless predictions about how technology will put an end to the 
constraints of geography. Some believe that that day has finally come. The 
Economist magazine proclaimed the "death of distance" in 1995 (http://
www.economist.com/node/598895). A decade later, The New York Times 
columnist Tom Friedman proclaimed The World Is Flat (Farrar, Straus,  Giroux, 
2005). Between airplanes, the Internet, social media, and smart phones, 
the argument goes, the distances that once separated us have contracted 
to nothing; no matter where we live, we can all work and compete on the  
same terms. 
But dig a little deeper and you'll realize that place and geography matter 
more today than they ever did. And not just in some abstract academic way, 
but in your daily lives. 
Why Where Matters
We tend to focus on two big decisions: who we choose as our life part-
ner and what we do for work. But there is a third big decision—where 
you choose to live. The decision about where may be the most impor-
tant, because it has a huge bearing on the others (Richard Florida, Who's 
Your City. Basic Books, 2008). 
Where you choose to live affects every aspect of your being. It in-
fluences the income you can potentially earn, and how far you can de-
velop your skills. It has a bearing on the friends and romantic partners 
you can potentially meet, the networks you can build, and the options 
that will be available to your children. It shapes your values and your 
politics. It plays a role in how happy and healthy you are, and in your 
overall quality of life.
It's something of a paradox. As globalized as we may be, wealth and 
power are more concentrated and clustered than ever before. Location 
matters. It is true that communications are instantaneous and journeys that 
used to take months now take only hours, but the key factors that determine 
whether a place prospers are unevenly distributed; some are much more 
endowed with them than others. 
Welcome to the Spiky World
When we overlay graphs of economic output, population, and innovation  
on a map, some places, especially those in the United States, Western 
 Europe, and Asia, tower over the rest. Just look at the level of innovation in 
Tokyo! The world is anything but flat; it is spiky (Figure 1.A). 
Those high levels of innovation and a disproportionate share of the 
world's economic activity occur in the geographic clusters called mega-re-
gions—galaxy-like clusters of cities and their suburbs that grow and evolve 
into coherent geographic entities. These include great Bos-Wash (Boston-
New York-Washington) Corridor, which would rank as the world's fourth 
largest economy, behind the United States itself and China and Japan; Am-
Bruss-Twerp spanning Amsterdam, Antwerp and Brussels; and the area that 
runs from London to Leeds, Manchester, Liverpool, and Birmingham. All told, 
the globe's 40 leading mega-regions produce two-thirds of the world's eco-
nomic output and nine in ten of its technological innovations, while housing 
less than one in five of its people.

CHAPTER 1   Geography Matters   35
Urban Planet
Big cities have become the core social and economic organizing units of our time, 
replacing the farm and the factory of previous epochs. As the great urbanist Jane 
Jacobs was perhaps the first to document in her book The Economy of Cities (Ran-
dom House, 1969), big cities are cauldrons of innovation; when diverse people 
live and work in close quarters, they come up with new ideas that improve the 
productivity of existing industries and generate new ones. 
This geographic clustering of diverse and talented people is what makes 
cities different than all other biological and social organisms. Typically when 
organisms get bigger their metabolisms slow down. But as cities get larger 
and larger their "urban metabolism"—measured variously as their economic 
activity or ability to innovate—speeds up. (Bettencourt, Lobo, et al., "Growth, 
Innovation, Scaling, and the Pace of Life in Cities," Proceedings of the National 
Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, http://www.pnas.org/
content/104/17/7301.full).
The geographic clustering of people will only grow. Over the course of 
the next century, the world's urban populations are projected to increase by 
as many as 5 billion people. Most of that will be happening in the rapidly 
urbanizing areas of South East Asia and Africa. To accommodate them, exist-
ing cities will expand substantially and hundreds of cities are likely to emerge 
(http://marroninstitute.nyu.edu/content/working-papers/urbanization-as-op-
portunity1). Ensuring that those cities are vibrant, sustainable, and functional 
will be the grandest of the grand challenges humanity will ever face. Our 
success or failure will have a bearing on everything from our ability to miti-
gate poverty and climate change to how successfully the world continues to 
democratize. 
Distance is not dead and geography is far from over. The fact is, place 
matters more today than it ever has.

of Toronto's Rotman School of Management, Global Research Professor at

1. Use the online "Place Finder" tool (http://www.creativeclass.
com/_v3/whos_your_city/place_finder/) to identify the city that is 
best suited to you. Come up with three to five cities you think you 
might want to live and work in and then use the Place Finder tool 
to rate and rank them. Which is your best city and why?
 
2. According to Figure 1.B, neighboring cities in the orange colored 
areas are growing into large mega-regions. Some of these even cross 
national boundaries and in some respects have more in common 
with each other than their respective countries. Is it possible that city 
regions will become more significant units of place than nation states?

Maps not only describe data but also serve as important 
sources of data and tools for analysis. Because of their 
central importance to geographers, they can also be objects 
of study in their own right. 
They express particular interpretations of the world, and 
affect how we understand the world- and how we see 
ourselves in relation to others. All maps are "social prod-
ucts," and generally reﬂect the power of the people who 
draw them up. The design of maps- what they include, what 
they omit, and how their content is portrayed- inevitably 
reﬂects the experiences, priorities, interpretations, and 
intentions of their authors.

information by connecting points of equal data

A map scale is the ratio between linear distance on a map and linear distance on Earth's surface, usually expressed in terms of a 
representative fraction (in the example of Figure 1.1.1A, 1/25,000) or ratio (1:25,000). Small-scale maps are maps based on small 
representative fractions (for example, 1/10,000,000). Large-scale maps are maps based on larger representative fractions (e.g., 
1/10,000).
Maps that are designed to represent the spatial dimensions of 
particular conditions, processes, or events are called thematic 
maps. These can be based on any one of a number of devices that 
allow cartographers or map makers to portray spatial variations or 
spatial relationships. One of these is the isoline, a line (similar to a 
contour) that connects places of equal data value (for example 
precipitation, as in Figure 1.2.1). Maps based on isolines are known 
as isopleth maps.
Isolines connect 
places of equal 
data value.

A map projection is a systematic rendering on a ﬂat surface of the geographic coordinates of features found on Earth's surface. 
Because Earth's surface is curved, it is impossible to represent on a ﬂat plane without some distortion. Cartographers have devised 
different techniques for projecting latitude and longitude onto a ﬂat surface, and the resulting representations each have advantages and 
disadvantages. None of them can represent distance correctly in all directions, though many can represent compass bearings, or area 
without distortion.
One particular kind of map projection that is sometimes used in small-scale thematic maps is the cartogram. In this kind of projection, 
space is transformed according to statistical factors, with the largest mapping units representing the greatest statistical values.

Compass directions between any two 
points are true, and the shapes of 
landmasses are true but their relative 
size is distorted.

Distances measured from the center of the map 
are true, but direction, area, and shape are 
increasingly distorted as the distance from the 
center point increases.

Relative sizes are true, but shapes

balance the properties of the map. It is designed purely for appearance 
and is best used for thematic and reference maps at the world scale.

research. Market research consultants, using statistical meth-
ods similar to those used by urban social geographers, are able 
to identify the geography of different types of households ac-
cording to their distinctive consumption patterns and pref-
erences as well as their socioeconomic and demographic 
attributes and their typical residential settings. The digital me-
dia used by GIS make such applications very flexible.
As maps have become more commonplace, more people 
and more businesses have become more spatially aware. Nev-
ertheless, some critics have argued that GIS has been exploited 
by those who already possess power and control to increase 
the level of surveillance of the population. The fear is that 
GIS may be helping to create a world in which people are not 
treated and judged by who they are and what they do, but more 
by where they live. People's credit ratings, ability to buy in-
surance, and ability to secure a mortgage, for example, are all 
routinely judged in part by GIS-based analyses that take into 
account the attributes and characteristics of their neighbors.

Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
The combination of high-performance computing and comput-
erized record keeping has led to an unprecedented increase 
in the volume and popularity of geographic data. Geographic 
information systems (GIS) have rapidly grown to become one 
of the most important methods of geographic analysis, particu-
larly in the military and commercial worlds. The software in 
GIS incorporates programs to store and access spatial data, to 
manipulate those data, and to draw maps.
The primary requirement for data to be used in GIS is 
that the locations for the variables—the characteristics under 
consideration—are known. Location may be annotated by x, y, 
and z coordinates of longitude, latitude, and elevation, or by 
such systems as ZIP codes or highway mile markers. Any vari-
able that can be located spatially can be fed into a GIS. Data 
capture—putting the information into the system—is the most 
time-consuming component of GIS work. Different sources of 
data, using different systems of measurement, scales, and systems 
of representation, must be integrated with one another; changes 
must be tracked and updated. Many GIS operations in the United 
States, Europe, Japan, and Australia have begun to contract out 
such work to firms in countries where labor is cheaper. India has 
emerged as a major data-conversion center for GIS.
The most important aspect of GIS, from an analytical point 
of view, is that they allow data from several different sources, 
on different topics, and at different scales, to be merged. This 
allows analysts to emphasize the spatial relationships among 
the objects being mapped. A geographic information system 
makes it possible to link, or integrate, information that is dif-
ficult to associate through any other means.
Applications GIS technology can render visible many as-
pects of geography that were previously unseen. GIS can, for 
example, produce incredibly detailed maps based on millions 
of pieces of information—maps that could never have been 
drawn by human hands. One example of such a map is the sat-
ellite image reconstruction of the vegetation cover of the United 
States shown in Figure 1.5. At the other extreme of spatial scale, 
GIS can put places under the microscope, creating detailed new 
 insights using huge databases and effortlessly browsable media.
Many advances in GIS have come from military applica-
tions. GIS allows infantry commanders to calculate line of sight 
from tanks and defensive emplacements, allows drones and 
cruise missiles to fly below enemy radar, and provides a com-
prehensive basis for military intelligence. Beyond the military, 
GIS technology allows an enormous range of problems to be ad-
dressed. For instance, it can be used to decide how to manage 
farmland, to monitor the spread of infectious diseases, to monitor 
tree cover in metropolitan areas, to assess changes in ecosystems, 
to analyze the impact of proposed changes in the boundaries of 
legislative districts, to identify the location of potential business 
customers, to identify the location of potential criminals, and to 
provide a basis for urban and regional planning.
Some of the most influential applications of GIS have re-
sulted from geodemographic research. Geodemographic re-
search uses census data and commercial data (such as sales 
data and property records) about the populations of small 
districts in creating profiles of those populations for market 

CHAPTER 1   Geography Matters   39
SPATIAL ANALYSIS
The study of many geographic phenomena can be approached 
in terms of their arrangement as points, lines, areas, or surfaces 
on a map. This is known as spatial analysis. Location, distance, 
space, accessibility, and spatial interaction are five concepts 
that are key to spatial analysis. Although these concepts may be 
familiar from everyday language, they require some elaboration.
Location
Location is often nominal; that is, it is expressed solely in 
terms of the names given to regions and places. We speak, for 
example, of Washington, D.C., or of Georgetown, a location 
within Washington, D.C. Location can also be used as an ab-
solute concept, whereby locations are fixed mathematically 
through coordinates of latitude and longitude (Figure 1.6).
Latitude refers to the angular distance of a point on Earth's 
surface, measured in degrees, minutes, and seconds north or 
south from the equator. The equator is assigned a value of 0°. 
Lines of latitude around the globe run parallel to the equa-
tor, which is why they are sometimes referred to as parallels. 
Longitude refers to the angular distance of a point on Earth's 
surface, measured in degrees, minutes, and seconds east or 
west from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line 
that passes through both poles and through Greenwich, Eng-
land, which is assigned a value of 0° (see Box 1.3: "Window 
on the World: Greenwich, England"). Lines of longitude, called 
meridians, run from the North Pole (latitude 90° north) to the 
South Pole (latitude 90° south). Georgetown's coordinates are 
precisely 38°55'N, 77°00'E.
Thanks to the Global Positioning System (GPS), it is very 
easy to determine the latitude and longitude of any given point. 
The Global Positioning System consists of 31 satellites that or-
bit Earth on precisely predictable paths, broadcasting highly 
accurate time and locational information. The GPS is owned by 
the U.S. government, but the information transmitted by the sat-
ellites is freely available to everyone around the world. Never-
theless, other systems are in development: the European Union's 
Galileo positioning system, India's Indian Regional Navigational 
Satellite System, and China's Compass Navigation System. Basic 
GPS receivers can relay latitude, longitude, and height to within 
100 meters day or night, in all weather conditions, in any part 
of the world where there is an unobstructed line of sight to four 
or more GPS satellites. The most precise GPS receivers, costing 
thousands of dollars, are accurate to within a centimeter. The 
GPS has dramatically increased the accuracy and efficiency of 
collecting spatial data. In combination with GIS and remote 
sensing, GPS has revolutionized mapmaking—think, for exam-
ple, of Google Maps—and spatial analysis. The introduction of 
tracking technology in cell phones and other devices, and the 
consequent proliferation of apps for everything from navigation 
to shopping, has meanwhile had a transformational effect on 
many aspects of life among more affluent populations.
Site and Situation Location can also be relative, fixed 
in terms of site or situation. Site refers to the physical attri-
butes of a location: its terrain, its soil, vegetation, and water 
sources, for example. Situation refers to the location of a place 
relative to other places and human activities: its accessibility 
to routeways, for example, or its nearness to population cen-
ters. The location of telecommunications activities in Denver, 
Colorado, provides a good example of the significance of the 
geographic concepts of site and situation. Because of its site 
and situation, Denver is a major center for cable television 
and associated specialized support companies. Denver's site, 
1.6 kilometers (1 mile) above sea level, is important because 
it gives commercial transmitters and receivers a better "view" 
of communications satellites. Its situation, on the 105th merid-
ian and equidistant between the telecommunications satellites

1.3 Window on the World
Greenwich, England
Greenwich is the historic reference point for the standardized measurement 
of both space and time. Historically, Greenwich represented a prime defen-
sive site with excellent river access. It is situated on the most dramatic outer 
curve of the River Thames, where the river's current has scoured a deep 
channel. Archaeological digs have found remains of prehistoric, Roman, 
Saxon, and Danish settlements. The making of the district, though, was royal 
patronage, and the result was a collection of buildings in a distinctive setting 
that have been added to UNESCO's World Heritage List.
Greenwich was first developed as a royal residence in the fifteenth cen-
tury. The Tudor monarchs Henry VIII, Mary I, and Elizabeth I were all born 
there. It was Henry VIII who intensified the naval presence along this stretch of 
the Thames, founding two new shipyards as his navy grew. In the seventeenth 
century, the hillside behind the royal palaces was landscaped into Greenwich 
Park by King Charles II. On the brow of the hill the king sited his Royal Ob-
servatory (Figure 1.C), designed by Christopher Wren with the assistance 
of scientist Robert Hooke. With the increasing importance of British mari-
time trade and naval power in the seventeenth century, the role of astron-
omy in navigation became critically important. Charles II founded the Royal 
Observatory to solve the problem of finding longitude at sea. As a result 
of the observatory's preeminence in the field, together with British imperial 
power and influence, Greenwich Meridian and Greenwich Mean Time were 
 adopted as global standards for the measurement of space and time in 1884  
(Figure 1.D).
▲ Figure 1.C Royal Observatory, Greenwich
▲ Figure 1.D The Greenwich Meridian
that are in geostationary orbit over the Pacific and Atlantic 
oceans, allows it to send cable programming directly not just 
to the whole of the Americas but also to Europe, the Middle 
East, India, Japan, and Australia—to every continent, in fact, 
except Antarctica. This precludes "double-hop" transmission 
(in which a signal goes up to a satellite, then down, then up 
and down again), which increases costs and decreases picture 
quality. Before the location of telecommunications facilities in 
Denver, places east or west of the 105th meridian had to dou-
ble-hop some of their transmissions because satellite dishes 
could not have a clear "view" of both the Pacific and Atlantic 
telecommunications satellites. (Figure 1.7).
Mental Maps Finally, location also has a cognitive dimen-
sion, in that people have cognitive images of places and re-
gions, compiled from their own knowledge, experiences, 
and impressions. Cognitive images (sometimes referred to as 
mental maps) are psychological representations of locations 
that spring from people's individual ideas and impressions of 
these locations. These representations can be based on direct

1. What is the historical significance of Greenwich? Why do you 
think it represents the global standard for measuring time and 
space?
 
2. Do you think there is a legacy on how we view the world by 
centering Greenwich, London, England? What if we had used 
Tokyo, Japan, Baghdad, or Iraq as the center? What if we flipped 
the globe from the perspective of New Zealand and had the 
South Pole on top? How do orientations of the "center" affect our 
 perspectives on world power and influence?
Meanwhile, King Charles had decided to build a new palace by 
the river. Building began in 1696 and continued throughout much of 
the eighteenth century, during which the complex was changed from 
a palace to a royal hospital for seamen. The result was Britain's most 
outstanding group of classical buildings (Figure 1.E). The hospital com-
plex became a symbol not only of intellectual and artistic refinement 
but also of Britain's growing naval power. At the height of British sea 
power, in 1873, the complex was converted to house the Royal Naval 
College. This brought the navy's officer class, its families and its suppli-
ers to Greenwich, shaping the character of the district for more than a 
century before the hospital complex was converted again, this time for 
use by the University of Greenwich and the Trinity Laban Conservatoire 
of Music and Dance.
experiences, on written or visual representations of actual loca-
tions, on hearsay, on imagination, or on a combination of these 
sources. Location in these cognitive images is fluid, depending 
on a given individual's changing information and perceptions 
of the principal landmarks in their environment.
Some things may not be located in a person's cognitive im-
age at all. Figure 1.8 shows a cognitive image of Washington, 
D.C. Georgetown is shown on this mental map, even though 
it is some distance from the residence of the person who 
sketched her image of the city. Less well-known and less dis-
tinctive places do not appear in this particular image.
Distance
Distance is also useful as an absolute physical measure, whose 
units we may count in kilometers or miles. Distance can also be 
a relative measure, expressed in terms of time, effort, or cost. It 
can take more or less time, for example, to travel 10 kilometers 
from point A to point B than it does to travel 10 kilometers 
from point A to point C. Similarly, it can cost more or less. 
Geographers have to recognize that distance can sometimes be 
in the eye of the beholder. It can seem longer or shorter, more 
or less pleasant, to travel from A to B as compared to traveling 

42 
HUMAN GEOGRAPHY   Places and Regions in Global Context
from A to C. This is cognitive distance, the 
distance that people perceive as existing in 
a given situation. Cognitive distance is based 
on people's personal judgments about the de-
gree of spatial separation between points.
Distance is a fundamental factor in deter-
mining real-world relationships and this is a 
central theme in geography. It was once de-
scribed as the "first law" of geography: "Ev-
erything is related to everything else, but near 
things are more related than distant things." 
Waldo Tobler, the geographer who put it this 
way, is one of many who have investigated 
the friction of distance, the deterrent or in-
hibiting effect of distance on human activity. 
The friction of distance is a reflection of the 
time and cost of overcoming distance.
What these geographers have established 
is that these effects are not uniform—that 
is, they are not directly proportional to dis-
tance itself. This is true whether distance is 
measured in absolute terms (i.e., kilometers) 
or in relative terms (i.e., time- or cost-based 
measures). The deterrent effects of extra dis-
tance tend to lessen as greater distances are 
involved. Thus, for example, while there is a 
big deterrent effect in having to travel 2 kilo-
meters instead of 1 to get to a grocery store, 
the deterrent effect of the same extra distance 
(1 kilometer) after already traveling 10 kilo-
meters is relatively small.
Distance-Decay and the Utility of Places
This sort of relationship creates what geog-
raphers call a distance-decay function. A 
distance-decay function describes the rate 
at which a particular activity or phenom-
enon diminishes with increasing distance. 
Typically, the farther people have to travel, 
the less likely they are to do so. Distance-
decay functions reflect people's behavioral 
response to opportunities and constraints 
in time and space. As such, they reflect the

Rasheda DuPree, an urban affairs major at Virginia Tech, as part of a class exercise in recalling loca-
tions within students' hometowns. Rasheda has included many of Washington's most prominent land-
marks and some of its distinctive districts, including Georgetown. In contrast, there are no recorded 
locations in the city's southeastern quarter (marked by a skull and crossbones in her sketch) or in the 
eastern outskirts (marked as "the burbs").

utility of particular locations. The utility of a specific place 
or location is its usefulness to a particular person or group. 
In practice, utility is thought of in different ways by different 
people in different situations. The emphasis may be on cost, 
on profitability, on prestige, on security, or on ease of mobil-
ity, for example, or more likely on some combination of these 
attributes. However place utility is determined, people in 
most circumstances tend to seek to maximize the net utility of 

CHAPTER 1   Geography Matters   43
location. Because we seek to maximize the net utility of loca-
tion, a great deal of human activity is influenced by what Uni-
versity of Washington geographer Richard Morrill once called 
the "nearness principle." According to this principle—a more  
explicit version of Tobler's first law—people will seek to
■  maximize the overall utility of places at minimum effort;
■  maximize connections between places at minimum cost; and
■  locate related activities as close together as possible.
The result is that patterns of behavior between people and 
places come to take on fairly predictable, organized patterns.
APPLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE
1. What is Tobler's law of geography and how does it relate to distance?
2. Provide three examples of the inhibiting effect that distance has 
on human activity. 
Space
Like distance, space can be measured in absolute, relative, and 
cognitive terms. Human geographers talk about space in various 
ways. Absolute space is a mathematical space described through 
points, lines, areas, planes, and configurations whose relation-
ships can be fixed precisely through mathematical reasoning. 
Several ways of analyzing space mathematically are of use to ge-
ographers. The conventional way is to view space as a container, 
defined by rectangular coordinates and measured in absolute 
units of distance (e.g., kilometers or miles). But some dimensions 
of space and aspects of spatial organization do not lend 
themselves to description simply in terms of distance. 
Topological space is measured not in terms of conven-
tional measures of distance, but by the nature and degree 
of connectivity between locations. The connectivity of 
people and places is important: whether they are linked, 
how they are linked, and so on. These attributes deter-
mine the flows of people and things (goods, information) 
and the centrality of places. The map of the Metro system 
in Milan, Italy (Figure 1.9) is a topological map, showing 
how specific points are joined within a particular net-
work. As most Milanese know, the Metro system gives 
Duomo a very high degree of connectivity because trains 
on both the M1 (red) and M3 (yellow) lines stop there. 
Duomo is therefore relatively central within the "space of 
flows" of passenger traffic. Missori—nearby in absolute 
terms and on the M3 line—is much less central, however, 
and much less the focus of passenger flows.
Socioeconomic space can be described in terms of 
sites and situations, routes, regions, and distribution pat-
terns. In these terms, spatial relationships are fixed through 
measures of time, cost, profit, and production, as well as 
through physical distance. For human geographers, some 
of the most important aspects of socioeconomic space 
have to do mapping, analyzing, and understanding the in-
equalities among places and regions (see Box 1.4: "Spatial 
Inequality"). Experiential or  cultural space is the space of 
people with common ties,  described through the places, 
territories, and settings whose attributes carry special 
meaning for particular groups. Finally, cognitive space is defined 
and measured in terms of people's values, feelings, beliefs, and per-
ceptions about locations, districts, and regions. Cognitive space can 
be described, therefore, in terms of behavioral space—landmarks, 
paths, environments, and spatial layouts.
Accessibility
Because it is a fundamental influence on the utility of  locations, 
distance is an important influence on people's behavior. Acces-
sibility is generally defined by  geographers in terms of relative 
location: the opportunity for contact or interaction from a given 
point or location in relation to other locations. It implies prox-
imity, or nearness, to something. Distance is one aspect of acces-
sibility, but it is by no means the only important aspect.
Connectivity is also an important aspect of accessibility be-
cause contact and interaction are dependent on channels of com-
munication and transportation: streets, highways, telephone lines, 
and wave bands, for example. Effective accessibility is a function 
not only of distance but also of the configuration of networks of 
communication and transportation. Commercial airline networks 
provide many striking examples of this. Cities that operate as air-
line hubs are much more accessible than cities that are served by 
fewer flights and fewer airlines. Charlotte, North Carolina, for ex-
ample (a U.S. Airways hub), is more accessible from Albany, New 
York, than from Richmond, Virginia, even though Richmond is 
400 kilometers (248 miles) closer to Albany than Charlotte. To get 
to Richmond from Albany, airline passengers must travel to Char-
lotte or another hub and change—a journey that takes longer and  
often costs more.

▲ Figure 1.9 Topological space The map of the Metro system in Milan, Italy, is a 
topological map, showing how specific points are joined within a particular network. The 
most important aspects of networks of any kind, from the geographer's viewpoint, are 
their connectivity attributes. These attributes determine the flows of people and things 
(goods, information) and the centrality of places. 

Identifying the spatial component of socioeconomic inequalities is crucial 
not only to the study of human geography but also to the improvement of 
conditions within society as a whole. Whatever the basic causes of inequal-
ity, it is clearly a problem that affects locational, as well as occupational, social, 
and demographic groups, and if we do not expect to discriminate against 
people on the bases of race, religion, color, or social class, neither should we 
discriminate against people on the basis of location.
There are many potential ways of assessing spatial inequality, and each 
chapter of this book will examine a different aspect. It is never simple or 
straightforward. How well-off we are may, in a capitalist society, be largely 
dependent on our monetary income and assets, but our real income and 
wealth depends not only on what money we receive but what we can do 
with it (what we can buy, and at what price), as well as on those goods that 
we do not purchase directly, such as fresh air, or a congenial community. Ac-
cordingly, geographers and others have attempted to compile composite

measures of social well-being, such as the Social Progress Index depicted at 
the international level in Figure 1.F. Note that geographers almost invari-
ably look at the conditions of populations as a whole, as in this example. But 
we must always remember that in most cases there is likely to be consider-
able diversity within countries, regions, and cities. Investigating patterns of 
spatial inequality at different scales of analysis is a necessary step in under-
standing how they came about, how they are changing, and what their ef-
fects may be.

CHAPTER 1   Geography Matters   45
Accessibility is often a function of economic, cultural, 
and social factors. In other words, relative concepts and mea-
sures of distance are often as important as absolute distance in 
determining accessibility. A nearby facility, such as a health 
care clinic, is accessible to us only if we can actually afford 
the cost of getting there, in other words, only if it seems close 
according to our own standards of distance, if we can afford to 
use the facility, if we feel that it is socially and culturally ac-
ceptable for us to use it, and so on. To take another example, a 
day care center may be located just a few blocks from a single-
parent family, but the center is not truly accessible if it opens 
after the parent has to be at work, if the cost of care is too high, 
or if the parent feels that the staff, children, or other parents at 
the center are from an incompatible social or cultural group.
Spatial Interaction
Interdependence between places and regions can be sustained 
only through movement and flows. Geographers use the term 
spatial interaction as shorthand for all kinds of movement and 
flows involving human activity. Freight shipments, commut-
ing, shopping trips, telecommunications, electronic cash trans-
fers, migration, and vacation travel are all examples of spatial 
interaction. The fundamental principles of spatial interaction 
can be reduced to four basic concepts: complementarity, trans-
ferability, intervening opportunities, and diffusion.
Complementarity For any kind of spatial interaction to oc-
cur between two places, there must be a demand in one place 
and a supply that matches, or complements, it in the other. 
This complementarity can be the result of several factors. One 
important factor is the variation in physical environments 
and resource endowments from place to place. For example, a 
heavy flow of vacation travel from Swedish cities to Mediterra-
nean resorts is largely a function of climatic complementarity. 
To take another example, the flow of crude oil from Saudi Ara-
bia (with vast oil reserves) to Japan (with none) is a function of 
complementarity in natural resource endowments.
A second factor contributing to complementarity is the in-
ternational division of labor that derives from the evolution 
of the world's economic systems. The more developed coun-
tries of the world have sought to establish overseas suppli-
ers for their food, raw materials, and exotic produce, allowing 
these more developed countries to specialize in more profitable 
manufacturing and knowledge-based industries (see Chapter 2).  
Through a combination of colonialism, imperialism, and sheer 
economic dominance on the part of the more developed countries, 
less powerful countries have found themselves with economies 
that directly complement the needs of the more developed coun-
tries. Among the many flows resulting from this complementar-
ity are shipments of sugar from Barbados to the United Kingdom, 
bananas from Costa Rica and Honduras to the United States, palm 
oil from Cameroon to France, automobiles from France to Algeria, 
school textbooks from the United Kingdom to Kenya, and invest-
ment capital from the United States to less developed countries.
A third contributory factor to complementarity is spe-
cialization and economies of scale. Places, regions, and coun-
tries can derive economic advantages from the efficiencies 
created through specialization, which allows for larger-scale 
operations. Economies of scale are cost advantages to manu-
facturers in high-volume production; the average cost of pro-
duction falls with increasing output. Among other things, fixed 
costs (e.g., the cost of renting or buying factory space, which is 
the same—fixed—whatever the level of output from the factory) 
can be spread over higher levels of output so that the average 
cost per unit of production falls. Economic specialization re-
sults in complementarities, which in turn contribute to patterns 
of spatial interaction. For example, Israeli farmers specialize in 
high-value fruit and vegetable crops for export to the European 
Union, which in return exports grains and root crops to Israel.
Transferability Another precondition for interdependence 
between places is transferability, which depends on the fric-
tional (or deterrent) effects of distance. Transferability is a 
function of two things: the costs of moving a particular item, 
measured in real money and/or time, and the ability of the 
item to bear these costs. If, for example, the costs of moving 
a product from one place to another make it too expensive to 
sell successfully at its destination, then that product does not 
have transferability between those places.
Transferability also varies over time, with successive in-
novations in transport and communications technologies and 
successive waves of infrastructure development (canals, rail-
ways, harbor installations, roads, bridges, etc.). New technolo-
gies and new or extended infrastructures alter the geography 
of transport costs and the transferability of particular things 
between particular places. As a result, the spatial organization 
of many different activities is continually changing and read-
justing. The consequent tendency toward a shrinking world 
gives rise to time-space convergence, the rate at which places 
move closer together in travel or communication time or costs. 
Time-space convergence results from a decrease in the fric-
tion of distance as space-adjusting technologies have, in gen-
eral, brought places closer together over time (Figure 1.10). 
Overland travel between New York and Boston, for example, 
has been reduced from 3.5 days (in 1800) to 5 hours (in the 
2000s) as the railroad displaced stagecoaches and was in turn 
displaced by interstate automobile travel. Other important 
space-adjusting innovations include air travel and air cargo; 
telegraphic, telephonic, and satellite communications sys-
tems; national postal services; package delivery services; and 
modems, fiber-optic networks, and electronic-mail software.
What is most significant about the latest developments in 
transport and communication is that they are not only global in 
scope but also are able to penetrate to local scales. As this penetra-
tion occurs, some places that are distant in kilometers are becom-
ing closer together, while some that are close in terms of absolute 
space are becoming more distant in terms of their ability to reach 
one another electronically. Much depends on the mode of com-
munication—the extent to which people in different places are 
"plugged in" to new technologies. The shrinking of space has im-
portant implications for people's everyday conceptions of space 
and distance and for their level of knowledge about other places.
Intervening Opportunity While complementarity and 
transferability are preconditions for spatial interaction, in-
tervening opportunities are more important in determining 
the volume and pattern of movements and flows. Intervening

opportunities are alternative origins and/or destinations. 
Such opportunities are not necessarily situated directly  
between two points or even along a route between them. Thus, 
to take one of our previous examples, for Swedish families con-
sidering a Mediterranean vacation in Greece, resorts in Spain, 
southern France, and Italy are all likely to be intervening op-
portunities because they can probably be reached more quickly 
and cheaply than resorts in Greece.
The size and relative importance of alternative destinations 
are important aspects of the concept of intervening opportunity. 
For our Swedish families, Spanish resorts probably offer the 
greatest intervening opportunity because they contain the largest 
aggregate number of hotel rooms and vacation 
apartments. We can therefore state the prin-
ciple of intervening opportunity as follows: 
Spatial interaction between an origin and a 
destination will be proportional to the num-
ber of opportunities at that destination and 
inversely proportional to the number of op-
portunities at alternative destinations.
Spatial Diffusion Disease outbreaks, 
technological innovations, political move-
ments, and new musical fads all originate in 
specific places and subsequently spread to 
other places and regions. The way that things 
spread through space and over time—spatial 
diffusion—is one of the most important as-
pects of spatial interaction and is crucial to 
an understanding of geographic change.
Diffusion seldom occurs in an apparently 
random way, jumping unpredictably all over 
the map. Rather, it occurs as a function of sta-
tistical probability, which is often based on 
fundamental geographic principles of distance 
and movement. The diffusion of a contagious 
disease, for example, is a function of the prob-
ability of physical contact, modified by varia-
tions in individual resistance to the disease. 
The result is typically a "wave" of diffusion 
that describes an S-curve, with a slow buildup, 
rapid spread, and final leveling off (Figure 1.11).
It is possible to recognize several spatial 
tendencies in patterns of diffusion. In expan-
sion diffusion (also called contagion diffu-
sion), a phenomenon spreads because of the 
proximity of carriers, or agents of change, who 
are fixed in their location. An example would

▲ Figure 1.11 Spatial diffusion The spatial diffusion of many phenomena 
tends to follow an S-curve of slow buildup, rapid spread, and leveling off. In 
the case of the diffusion of an innovation, for example, it usually takes a while 
for enough potential adopters to find out about the innovation, and even 
longer for a critical mass of them to adopt it. After that the innovation spreads 
quite rapidly, until most of the potential adopters have been exposed.

be the diffusion of an agricultural innovation, such as the use of 
hybrid seed stock, among members of a local farming community.
With hierarchical diffusion (also known as cascade dif-
fusion), a phenomenon can be diffused from one location to 
another without necessarily spreading to people or places in 
between. An example would be the spread of a fashion trend 
from large metropolitan areas to successively smaller cities, 
towns, and rural settlements.
Many patterns and processes of diffusion reflect both ex-
pansion and hierarchical diffusion, as different aspects of 
human interaction come into play in different geographic set-
tings. The diffusion of outbreaks of communicable diseases, for 
example, usually involves a combination of expansion and hi-
erarchical diffusion.

REGIONAL ANALYSIS
Not all geographic phenomena are most effectively understood 
through spatial analysis. Geographers also seek to understand 
the complex relationships between peoples and places in terms 
of the similarities and differences among and between them 
and the identities and qualities associated with them. Here 
the key concepts are regionalization, landscape, and sense  
of place.
Regionalization
The geographer's equivalent of scientific classification is  
regionalization, with individual places or areal units being 
the objects of classification. Geographers are especially inter-
ested in functional regions (sometimes referred to as nodal re-
gions)—regions that, while they may exhibit some variability 
in certain attributes, share an overall coherence in structure 
and economic, political, and social organization. The coher-
ence and distinctive characteristics of a region are often stron-
ger in some places than in others. This point is illustrated by 
geographer Donald Meinig's core-domain-sphere model, which 
he set out in his classic essay on the Mormon region of the 
United States (Figure 1.12). In the core of a region the distinc-
tive attributes are very clear; in the domain they are dominant 
but not to the point of exclusivity; in the sphere they are pres-
ent but not dominant.
People's own conceptions of place, region, and identity 
may generate strong feelings of regionalism and section-
alism that feed back into the processes of place-making 
and regional differentiation. Regionalism is a term used 
to describe situations in which different religious or eth-
nic groups with distinctive identities coexist within the 
same state boundaries, often concentrated within a par-
ticular region and sharing strong feelings of collective 
identity. If such feelings develop into an extreme devo-
tion to regional interests and customs, the condition is 
known as sectionalism. Regionalism often involves eth-
nic groups whose aims include autonomy from a national 
state and the development of their own political power 
(see Chapter 10). In certain cases, enclaves of ethnic mi-
norities are claimed by the government of a country other 
than the one in which they reside. Irredentism is the as-
sertion by the government of a country that a minority 
living outside its formal borders belongs to it historically 
◀ Figure 1.12 The Mormon culture region Cultural attributes 
often gradually shade from one region to another, rather than having 
a single, clear-cut boundary. Geographer Donald Meinig's work on the 
Mormon culture region of the United States identified a "core" region, 
which exhibits all the attributes of Mormon culture; a "domain," where 
not all these attributes may be present (or may be less intense); and a 
"sphere," where some attributes of Mormon culture are present but 
often as a minority. (Adapted from D. Meinig, "The Mormon Culture 
Region: Strategies and Patterns in the Geography of the American 
West," Annals, Association of American Geographers, 55, 1965,  
pp. 191-220.)

▼ Figure 1.13 The power of place In some countries, particular landscapes have become powerfully symbolic of national 
identity. In Italy it is the classical landscape of Tuscany, with its scattered farms and villas, elegant cypress trees, silvery-green 
olive trees, and rolling fields with a rich mixture of cereals, vegetables, fruit trees, and vines.
and culturally. In some circumstances, as with Russia's claims 
on Russian-speaking enclaves in eastern Ukraine in 2014, irre-
dentism can lead to armed conflict.
Landscape
Geographers think of landscape as a comprehensive product of 
human action such that every landscape is a complex reposi-
tory of society. It is a collection of evidence about our charac-
ter and experience, our struggles and triumphs as humans. To 
better understand the meaning of landscape, geographers have 
developed different categories of landscape types based on the 
elements contained within them.
Ordinary landscapes (or vernacular landscapes, as they 
are sometimes called) are the everyday landscapes that people 
create in the course of their lives together. From crowded city 
centers to leafy suburbs and quiet rural villages, landscapes are 
lived in and changed and influence and change the perceptions, 
values, and behaviors of the people who live and work in them.
Symbolic landscapes, by contrast, represent particular val-
ues or aspirations that builders and financiers want to impart 
to a larger public. For example, the neoclassical architecture of 
the buildings of the federal government in Washington, D.C., 
along with the streets, parks, and monuments of the capital, 
constitute a symbolic landscape intended to communicate a 
sense of power but also of democracy in its imitation of the 
Greek city-state.
Some landscapes become powerfully symbolic of national 
identity. Nation-building depends heavily on stories of golden 
ages, enduring traditions, heroic deeds, shared hardships, 
and dramatic destinies, all located in traditional (or prom-
ised) homelands with hallowed sites and scenery. Landscapes 
thus become a way of picturing a nation. With the creation of 
modern Italy during the Risorgimento ("revival through unifi-
cation"—1815-1861), for example, the classical Tuscan land-
scape (Figure 1.13) became emblematic of Italy itself and has 
attracted landscape painters, romantic poets, and novelists 
ever since. Similarly, the West of Ireland (Figure 1.14) came to 
symbolize the whole of Ireland to Irish nationalists in the early 
twentieth century—partly because it was seen as the region 
least affected by British colonization, but also because its bare 
and rugged landscape seemed to contrast so strikingly with the 
more bucolic rural landscapes (Figure 1.15) by which England 
was popularly imagined.
Geographers now recognize that there are many layers 
of meaning embedded in the landscape. Landscapes reflect 
people's dreams and ideas as well as their material lives. The 
messages embedded in landscapes can be read as signs about 
values, beliefs, and practices, though not every reader will take 
the same message from a particular landscape (just as people 
may differ in their interpretation of a passage from a book). In 
short, landscapes both produce and communicate meaning, and 
one of our tasks as geographers is to interpret those meanings.
Sense of Place
Everyday routines experienced in familiar settings allow 
people to derive a pool of shared meanings. Often this car-
ries over into people's attitudes and feelings about them-
selves and their locality. When this happens, the result is a 

self-conscious sense of place. A sense of place refers to the 
feelings evoked among people as a result of the experiences 
and memories they associate with a place and to the symbol-
ism they attach to that place. It can also refer to the character 
of a place as seen by outsiders: its distinctive physical charac-
teristics and/or its inhabitants.
For insiders, this sense of place develops through 
shared dress codes, speech patterns, public comportment, 
and so on. A crucial concept here is that of the lifeworld, 
the taken-for-granted pattern and context for everyday liv-
ing through which people conduct their day-to-day lives 
without conscious attention. People become familiar 
with one another's vocabulary, speech patterns, dress 
codes, gestures, and humor as a result of routine encoun-
ters and shared experiences in bars and pubs, cafés and 
restaurants, shops and street markets, and parks. This is 
known as intersubjectivity: shared meanings that are de-
rived from everyday practice. Elements of daily rhythms 
(such as mid-morning grocery shopping with a stop for 
coffee, the aperitivo en route from work to home, and the 
after-dinner stroll) are all critical to the intersubjectivity 
that is the basis for a sense of place within a community  
(Figure 1.16). The same is true of elements of weekly

modern agricultural  practices, have brought about significant changes to both 
landscapes and society.

rhythms, such as street markets and farmers' markets, and of 
seasonal rhythms, such as festivals.
These rhythms, in turn, depend on certain kinds of spaces 
and places: not only streets, squares, and public open spaces 
but also "third places" (after home, first, and workplace, sec-
ond): the sidewalk cafés, pubs, post offices, drugstores, corner 
stores, and family-run trattoria that are the loci of routine activ-
ities and sociocultural transactions. Third places accommodate 
"characters," "regulars," and newcomers, as well as routine 
patrons and, like public spaces, facilitate casual encounters as 
well as settings for sustained conversations (Figure 1.17). The 
nature and frequency of routine encounters and shared experi-
ences depend a great deal on the attributes of these spaces and 
places.
A sense of place also develops through familiarity with the 
history and symbolism of particular elements of the physical 
environment—a mountain or lake, the birthplace of someone 
notable, the site of some particularly well-known event, or the 
expression of community identity through art. Sometimes it is 
deliberately fostered by the construction of symbolic structures 
such as monuments and statues. Often it is a natural outcome 
of people's familiarity with one another and their surroundings. 
Because of this consequent sense of place, insid-
ers feel at home and "in place."
For outsiders, a sense of place can be 
evoked only if local landmarks, ways of life, 
and so on are distinctive enough to evoke a sig-
nificant common meaning for people who have 
no direct experience of them. Central London, 
for example, is a setting that carries a strong 
sense of place to outsiders who have a sense of 
familiarity with the riverside panoramas, busy 
streets, and distinctive monuments and historic 
buildings.

CHAPTER 1   Geography Matters   51
DEVELOPING A GEOGRAPHICAL 
IMAGINATION
A geographical imagination allows us to understand changing 
patterns, processes, and relationships among people, places, 
and regions. Developing this capacity is increasingly important 
as the pace of change around the world increases to unprec-
edented levels.
It is often useful to think of places and regions as repre-
senting the cumulative legacy of successive periods of change. 
Following this approach, we can look for superimposed layers 
of development, or evidence of the imprint of different phases 
of local development (see Box 1.3, "Windows on the World: 
South Beach, Miami Beach"). We can show how some patterns 
and relationships last, while others are modified or obliterated. 
We can show how different places bear the imprint of differ-
ent kinds of change, perhaps in different sequences and with 
different outcomes. To do so, we must be able to identify the 
kinds of changes that are most significant.
We can prepare our geographical imagination to deal with 
an important aspect of spatial change by making a distinction be-
tween the general and the unique. This distinction helps account 
for geographical diversity and variety because it provides a way 
of understanding how and why one kind of change can result in 
a variety of spatial outcomes. Because the general effects of a par-
ticular change always involve some degree of modification as they 
are played out in different environments, unique outcomes result.
Although we can usually identify some general outcomes 
of major episodes of change, there are almost always some 
unique outcomes, too. Let us take two related examples. The 
Industrial Revolution of nineteenth-century Europe provides a 
good example of a major period of change. A few of the gen-
eral spatial outcomes were increased urbanization, regional 
specialization in production, and increased interregional and 
international trade. At one level, places could be said to have 
become increasingly alike: generic coalfield regions, industrial 
towns, ports, downtowns, worker housing, and suburbs.
It is clear, however, that these general outcomes were medi-
ated by the different physical, economic, cultural, and social attri-
butes of different places. Beneath the dramatic overall changes in 
the geography of Europe, new layers of diversity and variety also 
existed. Industrial towns developed their own distinctive charac-
ter as a result of their manufacturing specialties, their politics, the 
personalities and objectives of their leaders, and the reactions and 
responses of their residents. Downtowns were differentiated from 
one another as the general forces of commerce and land econom-
ics played out across different physical sites and within different 
patterns of land ownership. Various local socioeconomic and po-
litical factors gave rise to different expressions of urban design. 
Meanwhile, some places came to be distinctive because they were 
almost entirely bypassed by this period of change, their character-
istics making them unsuited to the new economic and spatial or-
der (Figure 1.18).
The second example of general and unique outcomes 
of change is the introduction of the railroad, one of the spe-
cific changes involved in the Industrial Revolution. In general 
terms, the railroad contributed to time-space convergence, to 
the reorganization of industry into larger market areas, to an 
increase in interregional and international trade, and to the 
▲ Figure 1.18 Hersbrück, Germany Hersbrück was once a prosperous 
regional center on an overland trade route—the "Golden Road"—between 
Nuremberg and Prague. After 1806, when Napoleon redrew the political 
map of Europe, the reorganization of the European economy, together with 
the onset of the Industrial Revolution, left Hersbrück somewhat isolated and 
economically disadvantaged. Hersbrück was never drawn into the industrial 
development of Germany and is not well connected to the transportation 
infrastructure of canals, railways, or major highways.
interconnectedness of urban systems. Other unique outcomes, 
however, have also contributed to distinctive regional geogra-
phies. In Britain, the railroad was introduced to an environ-
ment that was partially industrialized and densely settled. The 
increased efficiencies provided by the railroad helped to turn 
Britain's economy into a highly integrated and intensively ur-
banized national economy. In Spain, however, the railroad was 
introduced to an environment that was less urbanized and in-
dustrialized and less able to afford the costs of railroad con-
struction. The result was that the relatively few Spanish towns 
connected by the railroads gained a massive comparative  
advantage. As a result, Spain's space-economy was much less 
integrated than Britain's, with an urban system dominated by 
just a few towns and cities.

Places and regions are constantly in a state of change. This raises 
the question of what we may expect to see in the future. An un-
derstanding of geographic processes and principles, together 
with a knowledge of past and present spatial patterns, allows us 
to make informed judgments about future geographies: an im-
portant dimension of applying our geographical imagination.
Whereas much of the world had remained virtually un-
changed for decades, even centuries, the Industrial Revolution 
and long-distance, high-speed transportation and communica-
tions brought a rapid series of rearrangements to the country-
side and to towns and cities in many parts of the world. Today, 
with a globalized economy and global telecommunications and 
transportation networks, places have become much more inter-
dependent, and still more of the world is exposed to increas-
ingly urgent imperatives to change.
Will social networking sites bring about new patterns of hu-
man interaction? Will we be able to cope with the environmen-
tal stresses of increasing industrialization and rapid population 
growth? Will the United States retain its position as the world's 
most powerful and influential nation? What kind of problems 
will the future bring for local, regional, and international de-

impact in reshaping human geographies? Will globalization 
undermine regional cultures? These are just a few of the many 
questions that spring from the key themes in human geography.
As we begin to look to the future, we can appreciate that 
some dimensions of human geography are more certain than 
others. We can only guess, of course, at some aspects of the 
future. Two of the most speculative realms are those of poli-
tics and technology, which are both likely to spring surprises 
at any time. On the other hand, in some ways the future is al-
ready here, embedded in the world's institutional structures 
and in the dynamics of its populations (Figure 1.19). We know, 
for example, a good deal about the demographic trends of the 
next quarter century, given present populations, birth and 
death rates, and so on. We also know a good deal about the 
distribution of environmental resources and constraints, about 
the characteristics of local and regional economies, and about 
the legal and political frameworks within which geographic 
change will probably take place. The tools and concepts of hu-
man geography allow us to understand change in terms of local 
place-making processes that are subject to certain broader prin-
ciples of spatial organization as well as the overall framework 
of the global economy. In subsequent chapters, as we look 
more closely at specific aspects of human geography, we shall 
be able to see how geographic process and principles can sug-
gest future patterns and pathways of change.

CHAPTER 1   Geography Matters   53
CONCLUSION
Human geography is the systematic study of the location of peoples 
and human activities across Earth's surface and of their relation-
ships to one another. An understanding of human geography is im-
portant both from an intellectual point of view (i.e., understanding 
the world around us) and a practical point of view (e.g., contribut-
ing to environmental quality, human rights, social justice, business 
efficiency, political analysis, and government policymaking).
Human geography reveals how and why geographical re-
lationships matter in terms of cause and effect in relation to 
economic, social, cultural, and political phenomena. Human 
geographers strive to recognize these wider processes and 
broad geographical patterns without losing sight of the unique-
ness of specific places.
Geography matters because it is in specific places that peo-
ple learn who and what they are and how they should think and 
behave. Places are also a strong influence, for better or worse, on 
people's physical well-being, their opportunities, and their life-
style choices. Places also contribute to peoples' collective mem-
ory and become powerful emotional and cultural symbols. Places 
are the sites of innovation and change, of resistance and conflict.
To investigate specific places we must be able to frame our 
studies of them within the compass of the entire globe. This is 
important for two reasons. First, the world consists of a com-
plex mosaic of places and regions that are interrelated and 
interdependent in many ways. Second, place-making forces—
especially economic, cultural, and political forces that influ-
ence the distribution of human activities and the character of 
places—are increasingly operating at global and international 
scales. In Chapter 2, we describe the changing global context 
that has shaped places and regions around the world.
LEARNING OUTCOMES REVISITED
■ Explain how the study of geography has become essential for 
understanding a world that is more complex, interdependent, 
and changing faster than ever before.
Geography matters because it enables us to understand where 
we are both literally and figuratively. Geography provides an 
understanding of the interdependency of people and places 
and an appreciation of how and why certain places are dis-
tinctive or unique. From this knowledge, we can begin to un-
derstand the implications of future spatial patterns.
■ Identify four examples of how places influence inhabitants' lives.
Specific places provide the settings for people's daily lives. 
Places are settings for social interaction that, among other 
things, structure the daily routines of people's economic and 
social lives; provide both opportunities for—and constraints 
on—people's long-term social well-being; establish a context 
in which everyday commonsense knowledge and experience 
are gathered; provide a setting for processes of socialization; 
and provide an arena for contesting social norms.
■ State the differences among major map projections and de-
scribe their relative strengths and weaknesses.
The choice of map projection depends largely on the pur-
pose of the map. Equidistant projections allow distance to 
be represented as accurately as possible but in only one 
direction (usually north-south). Conformal projections 
render compass directions accurately but tend to exagger-
ate the size of northern continents. Equivalent projections 
portray areas on Earth's surface in their true proportions 
but result in world maps on which many locations appear 
squashed and have unsatisfactory outlines.
■ Explain how geographers use geographic information systems 
(GIS) to merge and analyze data.
New technologies combine high-performance computing, 
global positioning systems (GPS), and computerized re-
cord keeping. The most important aspect of these technol-
ogies, from an analytical point of view, is that they allow 
data from several different sources, on different topics and 
at different scales, to be merged.
■ Summarize the five concepts that are key to spatial analysis 
and describe how they help geographers to analyze relation-
ships between peoples and places.
The study of many geographic phenomena can be ap-
proached in terms of their arrangement as points, lines, ar-
eas, or surfaces on a map. This is known as spatial analysis. 
Location, distance, space, accessibility, and spatial interac-
tion are five concepts that are key to spatial analysis. Each 
of these concepts is multifaceted and can be applied to dif-
ferent spatial scales. Together, they provide a powerful set 
of tools for describing and analyzing places and regions.
■ Describe the importance of distance in shaping human activity.
The first law of geography is that "Everything is related to 
everything else, but near things are more related than are 
distant things." Human activity is influenced by the "near-
ness principle," according to which people tend to seek to 
maximize the overall utility of places at minimum effort, 
to maximize connections between places at minimum cost, 
and to locate related activities as close together as possible.
■ Summarize the three concepts that are key to regional analysis 
and explain how they help geographers analyze relationships 
between peoples and places.
The key concepts of regional analysis are regionalization, 
landscape, and sense of place. Regionalization is the geog-
rapher's equivalent of scientific classification; landscapes 
embody many layers of meaning and reflect the influence 
of past processes of change, while sense of place derives 
from everyday routines experienced in familiar settings. 
Geographers also seek to understand the complex relation-
ships between peoples and places in terms of the simi-
larities and differences among and between them and the 
identities and qualities associated with them.

1. Consider how GIS links and integrates different kinds of 
geographical data. Make a list of location-based services 
(LBS) that your mobile phone connection is providing 
you with. Take any three examples of LBS and write how 
they too link and integrate different kinds of geographical 
data. Examine the manner in which LBS use the five key 
concepts of spatial analysis, i.e. location, distance, space, 
accessibility and spatial interaction, in providing these 
services.
2. Decide on a location that all members of your group are  
familiar with, such as your local place of worship, city 
hall, or local market. As individuals, take 10 minutes to 
make a cognitive sketch of the agreed-upon location (see 
Figure 1.8 for an example of a cognitive sketch). Come 
back together as a group and compare your drawings. How 
did the cognitive sketches in your group differ? How were 
they similar? List five things that are most striking about 
your sketches.
 3. Consider the features that give your specific location a 
sense of place by creating a list of at least ten things. Make 
sure your list is specific; take into consideration thinks like 
vocabulary, speech patterns, clothing, and jokes that are 
trending, as well as physical geography. Once this is com-
plete, consider how an "outsider" would interact with and 
understand your place.
UNPLUGGED
1. Consider spatial interaction from the point of view of your 
own life. Take an inventory of food you consume in a day, 
noting, where possible, the location where each item of 
food was produced, bought, and consumed. Was the store 
where you bought the food part of a regional, national, or 
international chain? Where was the food processed? How 
far did it travel from point of production to the grocery 
store to your plate? How would you go about representing 
the journey your food traveled on a thematic map?
2. Ask your neighbors to draw maps of familiar places in your 
locality (e.g. the local shopping complex, park, school, or 
hospital area) and compare it with actual maps of these 
sites. List the similarities and differences between the two 
maps, and state your opinion on how scientific and mental 
maps might be integrated to plan your locality better.
 3. Choose a local landscape, one with which you are 
familiar, and write a short essay (500 words, or two 
double-spaced typed pages) about how the landscape 
has evolved over time. Note especially any evidence that 
physical environmental conditions have shaped any of 
the human elements in the landscape, as well any evi-
dence of people having modified the physical landscape.
 4. Figures 1.13-1.15 show examples of landscapes that have 
acquired a strong symbolic value because of the buildings, 
events, people, or histories with which they are associ-
ated. Find five photographs of landscapes that have strong 
symbolic value to a large number of citizens of your own 
region or country, and state in 25 words or less why each 
setting has acquired such value.

DATA ANALYSIS
In this chapter, the concepts of place, identity and 
the dynamics of time and space were introduced. 
Seeing the world from a "geographic" perspective 
is a view relevant to everyone, and allows us to 
analyze how place impacts our daily lives. Ameri-
can urban planner Kevin Lynch once commented, 
"Every citizen has long-standing associations with some part 
of his city and this image is soaked in memories and mean-
ings." And geographer Doreen Massey said, "Really, think-
ing spatially means looking beyond ourselves, a recognition 
of others." Interrogate those ideas by creating a conceptual 
map of your identity from the spaces you have occupied—the 
places you were born, grew up, and now study and work. To 
start, use a conceptual mapping program like Prezi (http://
prezi.com). Chart your personal story alongside your geogra-
phy and the relationships you have formed from those places. 
Pull media like photos, maps, videos, and music into your 
conceptual map and answer the following questions:
 1. Where were you born? What languages and/or accents are 
spoken there? Were you born in a hospital?
 2. What neighborhood did you live in when you started 
school? Who were your friends? Where did you spend 
your summers? Did you travel? How far did you go and 
what forms of transportation did you use to get there?
 3. Where did you attend high school? Did you play sports, 
work, participate in drama and art scenes? Where did you 
"hang out"? Did you have a skate board route, a bike path, 
a swimming pool, or a favorite club or music scene that 
was part of your routine? How did any of these places and 
activities contribute to your identity?
 4. Who are the influential people in your life? Where do they 
live? How did you meet them? What did they teach/men-
tor/share with you that impacted you as a person?
 5. Where are you now? Are you attending school close to your 
city of origin or in a completely new country? What places 
are important to your education? Where do you relax? Do 
you have important relationships that are long distance?
 6. Finally, where do you want to go? What are the countries 
and/or cities you want to visit or live? Where do you want 
to work and build a family/life? Why are these places  
desirable to you?

THE CHANGING 
GLOBAL CONTEXT
2
The story is told of a little Korean girl who arrives in Los  Angeles,
sees a McDonald's restaurant, tugs at her mother's sleeve, and says, "Look, 
Mother, they have McDonald's in this country, too."
It has become a cliché about the twenty-first century that everywhere will 
come to look like everywhere else, with the same McDonalds, Pizza Hut, and 
Kentucky Fried Chickens, the same television programming with Hollywood 
movies and TV series, and the same malls selling the same Nike shoes, Phil-
ips electronics, and GAP clothing. Another cliché is that instantaneous global 
telecommunications, satellite television, and the Internet will soon overthrow 
all but the last vestiges of geographical differentiation in human affairs. Large 
corporations, according to this view, will no longer have strong ties to their 
home country, scattering their activities around the world in search of low-
cost, low-tax locations. Employees will work as effectively from home, car, 
or beach as they could in the offices that need no longer exist. Events half-
way across the world will be seen, heard, and felt with the same immediacy 
as events across town. National differences and regional cultures will dis-
solve, the cliché has it, as a global marketplace brings a uniform dispersion 
of people, tastes, and ideas. Such developments are, in fact, highly unlikely. 
Even in the Information Age, geography will still matter and may well be-
come more important than ever. Places and regions will undoubtedly change 
as a result of the new global context of the Information Age. But geography 
will still matter because of several factors: transport costs, different resource 
endowments, fundamental principles of spatial organization, people's territo-
rial impulses, the resilience of local cultures, and the legacy of the past.
In this chapter, we take a long-term, big-picture, perspective on changing hu-
man geographies, emphasizing the continuing interdependence among places 
and regions. We show how geographical divisions of labor have evolved with 
the growth of a worldwide system of trade and politics and with the chang-
ing opportunities provided by successive technology systems. As a result of 
this evolution, the world is now structured around a series of core regions, 
semiperipheral regions, and peripheral regions; and globalization seems to 
be intensifying many of the differences among places and regions, rather than 
diminishing them.

South America.
The transition to food-producing minisystems had sev-
eral important implications for the long-term evolution of the 
world's geographies:
 1. It allowed much higher population densities and encour-
aged the proliferation of settled villages.
 2. It brought about a change in social organization, from loose 
communal systems to systems that were more highly orga-
nized on the basis of kinship. Kin groups provided a natu-
ral way of assigning rights over land and resources and of 
organizing patterns of land use.
 3. It allowed some specialization in nonagricultural crafts, 
such as pottery, woven textiles, jewelry, and weaponry.
 4. Specialization led to a fourth development: the beginnings 
of barter and trade between communities, sometimes over 
substantial distances.
Most minisystems vanished a long time ago, although 
some remnants have survived to provide material for Discovery 
Channel and National Geographic specials. Examples of these 
residual and fast-disappearing minisystems are the bushmen 
of the Kalahari, the hill tribes of Papua New Guinea, and the 
tribes of the Amazon rain forest. They contribute powerfully 
to regional differentiation and sense of place in a few enclaves 
around the world, but their most important contribution to 
contemporary human geographies is that they provide a stark 
counterpoint to the landscapes and practices of the rest of the 
contemporary world.

1. What are some of the features of the hearth areas that allowed 
minisystems to thrive?
2. List and describe three examples of traditional crafts that were 
originally developed in the agricultural hearth areas of New  
Mexico and China. 
THE PREMODERN WORLD
The essential foundation for human geography is an ability to 
understand places and regions as components of a constantly 
changing global system. In this sense, all geography is histori-
cal geography. Built into every place and each region is the 
legacy of major changes in world geography. The world is 
an evolving, competitive, political-economic system that has 
developed through successive stages of geographic expansion 
and integration. This evolution has affected the roles of indi-
vidual places in different ways. It has also affected the nature 
of the interdependence among places. This explains why 
places and regions have come to be distinctive and how this 
distinctiveness has formed the basis of geographic variability. 
To understand the sequence of major changes in human geog-
raphy, we need to begin with the hearth areas of the first agri-
cultural revolution.
Hearth Areas
The first agricultural revolution involved a transition from 
hunter-gatherer groups to agricultural-based minisystems that 
were both more extensive and more stable. A minisystem is a 
society with a reciprocal social economy. That is, each individ-
ual specializes in particular tasks (e.g., tending animals, cook-
ing, or making pottery) and freely gives any excess product 
to others. The recipients reciprocate in turn by giving up the 
surplus product of their own specialization. Such societies are 
found only in subsistence-based economies. Because they do 
not have (or need) an extensive physical infrastructure, mini-
systems are limited in geographic scale.
The transition to minisystems began in the Proto-Neolithic 
(or early Stone Age) period, between 9000 and 7000 b.c.e., and 
was based on a series of technological preconditions: the use of 
fire to process food, the use of grindstones to mill grains, and 
the development of improved tools to prepare and store food. 
The key breakthrough was the evolution and diffusion of a sys-
tem of slash-and-burn agriculture (also known as "swidden" 
cultivation—see Chapter 9). Slash-and-burn is a system of 
cultivation in which plants are harvested close to the ground, 
the stubble left to dry for a period, and then ignited. The 
burned stubble provides fertilizer for the soil. Another impor-
tant breakthrough was the domestication of cattle and sheep, 
a technique that had become established in a few  regions by 
Neolithic times.
These agricultural breakthroughs could take place only in 
certain geographic settings: where natural food supplies were 
plentiful; where the terrain was diversified (thus offering a 
variety of habitats and species); where soils were rich and rela-
tively easy to till; and where there was no need for large-scale 
irrigation or drainage. Archaeological evidence suggests that 
the breakthroughs took place independently in several agri-
cultural hearth areas and that agricultural practices diffused 
slowly outward from each (Figure 2.1). Hearth areas are geo-
graphic settings where new practices have developed and from 
which they have spread. The main agricultural hearth areas 
were situated in four broad regions:

CHAPTER 2   The Changing Global Context   59
technology, a fixed  resource base meant that as populations 
grew, overall levels of productivity fell. For each additional 
person working the land, the gain in production per worker 
was less.
The usual response of empire builders to these dimin-
ishing returns was to enlarge the resource base by colonizing 
nearby land. This colonization had immediate spatial conse-
quences in terms of establishing dominant/subordinate spatial 
relationships between world-empires and colonies. Coloniza-
tion played a role in establishing hierarchies of settlements and 
creating improved transportation networks as well. The mili-
tary underpinnings of colonization also meant that new towns 
and cities came to be carefully sited for strategic and defensive 
reasons.
The legacy of these important changes is still apparent 
in today's landscapes. The clearest examples are in Europe, 
where the Roman world-empire colonized an extensive terri-
tory that was controlled through a highly developed system of 
towns and connecting roads. Most of today's important West-
ern European cities had their origins as Roman settlements. 
In quite a few, it is possible to trace the original street lay-
outs. In some, it is possible to glimpse remnants of Roman 
defensive city walls, paved streets, aqueducts, viaducts, are-
nas, sewage systems, baths, and public buildings (Figure 2.2b 
and 2.2c). In the modern European countryside, we can still 
read the legacy of the Roman world-empire in arrow-straight 
roads built by Roman engineers and maintained by successive 
generations.
The Growth of Early Empires
The higher population densities, changes in social organi-
zation, craft production, and trade brought about by the first  
agricultural revolution provided the preconditions for the 
emergence of several "world-empires." A world-empire is a 
group of minisystems that have been absorbed into a common 
political system. In world-empires, wealth flows from pro-
ducer classes to an elite class in the form of taxes or tribute. 
This redistribution of wealth is most often achieved through 
military coercion, religious persuasion, or a combination of the 
two. The best-known world-empires were the largest and lon-
gest lasting of the ancient civilizations—Egypt, Greece, China, 
Byzantium, and Rome (Figure 2.2a). These world-empires 
brought important new elements to the evolution of the world's 
geographies. One was the emergence of colonization; the other 
was urbanization (see Chapter 10).
Colonization Colonization—the physical settlement in 
a new territory of people from a colonizing state—was in 
part an indirect consequence of the operation of the law of 
 diminishing returns. This law refers to the tendency for pro-
ductivity to  decline after a certain point with the continued 
addition of capital and/or labor to a given resource base. 
World-empires could support growing populations only if 
overall levels of productivity could be increased. While some 
productivity gains could be achieved through better agri-
cultural practices, harder work, and improvements in farm 
▲ Figure 2.1 Hearth areas The first agricultural revolution took place independently in several hearth areas where hunter-gatherer communities experi-
mented with locally available plants and animals, eventually leading to their domestication. From these hearth areas, improved strains of crops, domesticated 
animals, and new farming techniques diffused slowly outward. Farming supported larger populations than hunting and gathering could, and the extra labor  
developed other specializations, such as making pottery and jewelry. The agricultural hearth area in Central America gave rise to the Aztec and Mayan  
world-empires; the hearth areas of the Andes in South America developed into the Inca world-empire.

Today, their legacy can be seen in the landscapes of terraced 
fields in places like Sikkim, India, and East Java, Indonesia

they were based on a particularly strong central state, with

were found in China, India, the Middle East, Central Amer-
ica, and the Andean region of South America. Most of them 
relied heavily on slave labor. Their development of large-scale

settlements, which acted as intermediate centers in the flow of 
tribute and taxes from colonized territories.
The most successful world-empires, such as the Greek and 
Roman, established quite extensive urban systems. In general, 
the settlements in these urban systems were not very large—
typically ranging from a few thousand inhabitants to about 
20,000. The seats of empire grew quite large, however. The 
Mesopotamian city of Ur, in present-day Iraq, for example, has 
been estimated to have reached a population of around 200,000 
by 2100 b.c.e., and Thebes, the capital of Egypt, is thought to 
have had more than 200,000 inhabitants in 1600 b.c.e. Athens 
and Corinth, the largest cities of ancient Greece, had popula-
tions between 50,000 and 100,000 by 400 b.c.e. Rome at the 
height of the Roman Empire (around c.e. 200) may have had 
as many as a million inhabitants. The most impressive thing 
about these cities, though, was not so much their size as their 
degree of sophistication: elaborately laid out, with paved 
streets, piped water, sewage systems, massive monuments, 
grand public buildings, and impressive city walls.
The Geography of the Premodern World
Figure 2.4 shows the generalized framework of human geogra-
phies in the Old World as they existed around 1400 c.e. The 
following characteristics of this period are important:
 1. Harsher environments in continental interiors were still 
characterized by isolated, subsistence-level, hunting-and-
gathering minisystems.
 2. The dry belt of steppes and desert margins stretching 
across the Old World from the western Sahara to Mongolia 
was a continuous zone of pastoral minisystems (minisys-
tems based on herding animals, usually moving with the 
animals from one grazing area to another).
 3. The principal areas of sedentary agricultural production 
(with permanently settled farmers) extended in a discon-
tinuous arc from Morocco to China, with two main outliers 
(not shown on the map in Figure 2.4), in the central Andes 
and in Mesoamerica.
The dominant centers of global civilization were China, 
northern India (both of them hydraulic society variants of 
world-empires), and the Ottoman Empire of the eastern Medi-
terranean. They were all linked by the Silk Road, a series of 
overland trade routes between China and Mediterranean 
Europe (Figure 2.5). From Roman times until Portuguese navi-
gators found their way around Africa and established seaborne 
trade routes, the Silk Road provided the main East-West trade 
route between Europe and China. This shifting trail of caravan 
tracks facilitated the exchange of silk, spices, and porcelain 
from the East and gold, precious stones, and Venetian glass 
from the West. The ancient cities of Samarkand, Bukhara, and 
Khiva stood along the Silk Road, places of glory and wealth 
that astonished Western travelers, such as Marco Polo in the 
thirteenth century. These cities were East-West meeting places 
for philosophy, knowledge, and religion, and in their prime 
they were known for producing scholars in mathematics, 
natural environment and that the study of geography provides 
the best way of addressing the interdependencies between 
places and between people and nature. The Greeks were also 
among the first to appreciate the practical importance and util-
ity of geographic knowledge, not least in politics, business, and 
trade. The word geography is in fact derived from the Greek 
language, the literal translation meaning "earth-writing" or 
"earth-describing." As Greek civilization developed, descrip-
tive geographical writing came to be an essential tool for 
recording information about sea and land routes and for pre-
paring colonists and merchants for the challenges and opportu-
nities of faraway places.
Urbanization Towns and cities became essential as cen-
ters of administration for early world-empires. Towns served 
as military garrisons and as theological centers for the ruling 
classes, who used a combination of military and theological 
authority to hold their empires together. While these early 
world-empires were successful, they gave rise not only to 
monumental capital cities but also to a whole series of smaller

music, architecture, and astronomy, such as Al Khoresm  
(780-847), Al Biruni (973-1048), and Ibn Sind (980-1037). 
The cities' prosperity was marked by impressive feats of 
Islamic architecture.
By 1400 c.e., other important world-empires had devel-
oped in Southeast Asia, in Muslim city-states of coastal North

AN INTERDEPENDENT WORLD 
GEOGRAPHY
When exploration beyond European shores began to be seen as 
an important way of opening up new opportunities for trade 
and economic expansion, a modern world-system emerged. 
A world-system is an interdependent system of countries 
linked by political and economic competition. The term world- 
system, which was coined by historian Immanuel Wallerstein, 
is hyphenated to emphasize the interdependence of places and 
regions around the world.
By the sixteenth century, new techniques of shipbuild-
ing and navigation had begun to bind more and more places 
and regions together through trade and political competi-
tion. As a result, more and more peoples around the world 
were exposed to one another's technologies and ideas. Their 
different resources, social structures, and cultural systems 
resulted in quite different pathways of development, how-
ever. Some societies were incorporated into the new, Euro-
pean-based international economic system faster than others;  
characterized by the profit motive and the control of the means 
of production, distribution, and exchange of goods by private 
ownership.
Port cities were particularly important to capitalism. 
Among the leading centers were the city-state of Venice; the 
Hanseatic League of independent city-states in northwestern 
Europe (Figure 2.6); and Cairo, Calicut, Canton, and Malacca 
in North Africa and Asia. Traders in these port cities began to 
organize the production of agricultural specialties, textiles, and 
craft products in their respective hinterlands. The hinterland 
of a town or city is its sphere of economic influence—the area 
from which it collects products to be exported and through 
which it distributes imports. By the fifteenth century, several 
established regions of budding capitalism existed: northern 
Italy, Flanders, southern England, the Baltic Sea region, the 
Nile Valley, Malabar, Coromandel, Bengal, northern Java, and 
southeast coastal China.
The Expansion of Geographic Knowledge Between 
roughly 500 and 1400 c.e., geographic knowledge was pre-
served and expanded by Chinese and Islamic scholars. Chinese 
maps of the world from the same period were more accurate 
than those of European cartographers because the Chinese were 
able to draw on information brought back by imperial China's 
admirals who successfully navigated much of the Pacific and 
Indian oceans. Chinese geographers recognized, for example, 
that Africa was a southward-pointing triangle, whereas on 
 European and Arabic maps of the time it was always repre-
sented as pointing eastward.
With the rise of Islamic power in the Middle East and 
the Mediterranean in the seventh and eighth centuries c.e., 
centers of scholarship emerged in places such as Baghdad, 
Damascus, Cairo, and Granada, Spain. Here, surviving Greek 
and Roman texts were translated into Arabic by scholars 
such as Al-Battani, Al-Farghani, and Al-Khwarizmi. These 
Islamic scholars were also able to draw on Chinese geo-
graphical writing and cartography brought back by trad-
ers along the Silk Road. The requirement that the Islamic

2.1 Geography Matters
The Expansion and Disintegration of States
Brian W. Blouet, College of William and Mary in Virginia
During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the size of various 
world states tended to enlarge. The reasons for this territorial expan-
sion were various: for protection, the enlargement of national markets 
and, particularly in the nineteenth century, the development of new 
technologies, including the railroad and the telegraph, made it practi-
cal to integrate and administer much larger states than before. In the 
United States, Canada, and the Russian and German land empires, this 
expansion allowed information, people, and goods to move more easily 
over longer distances than previously.
The break-up of the Austro-Hungarian, Russian, German, and  Ottoman em-
pires following World War I reversed this enlargement trend. Many new, smaller 
states appeared in the wake of war, aided by the idea of  self-determination. 
Once introduced, self-determination—the  nationality principle—would not go 
back in the box. Subsequently, many of the new post World War I states were 
further divided, such as in Yugoslavia,  Czechoslovakia, and the USSR. 
In today's age of electronic communication, it is easy to share a separatist 
message and promote a sense of regional or national identity. When these 
nationalist sentiments are on the rise, the practical, economic facts are often 
 ignored. The start-up costs for a new state are high—a constitution has to 
be drawn up and agreed upon, a parliamentary body must be created, the 
machinery of government developed, a central bank established, and a new 
currency minted. 
Breaking Up is Hard to Do: Scotland and the  
United Kingdom
Many of these factors were evident in the 2014 campaign led by the  Scottish 
Nationalist Party for the Scots to exit the UK—independence was rejected in 
a referendum (Figure 2.A).
▲ Figure 2.A A rally for Scottsh independence. While 44.7% of the votes in the Scottish Independence Referendum said "Yes" to an independent Scot-
land, supporters of independence were not able to get the simple majority of votes needed to secede from the United Kingdom.

CHAPTER 2   The Changing Global Context   65
The reasons for failure of Scotland's bid for independence were several. 
What currency would a newly independent Scotland use? Would Scotland 
become a member of the EU? Brussels—the de facto seat of the European 
Parliament—was unequivocal that Scotland would be required to apply for 
EU membership. Even though the region had been part of the EU, it could 
not automatically retain membership. If Scotland's secession from the UK was 
instantly accepted by the EU, other regions might be encouraged to break 
up countries—places such as Catalonia, Galacia, and the Basque country in 
Spain. Belgium might split into a northern Flemish region and a southern 
Walloon area, and those northern parts of Italy that might want to dump the 
slower-growing south would have a precedent. 
The leader of the Scottish Nationalist Party, Alex Salmond, assumed that 
Scotland would automatically be an EU member and that Scotland's currency 
would be the pound sterling in a currency union. But as the British treasury 
in London explained, if Scotland continued to use the pound sterling, then 
London would still oversee the Scottish budget—and Scotland would not 
be fully independent. London was not going to let Scotland spend pounds 
without accountability as happened with Portugal, Ireland, and Greece—
countries that spent Euros they did not own, and had to be rescued by the 
European central bank.
England and Scotland had come together in 1603 when James VI of 
Scotland (a Stuart) legitimately succeeded to the English throne as James I 
of England. Today, Queen Elizabeth II is queen of England and queen of 
Scotland, where the monarch has an official residence at Holyrood Palace, 
in Edinburgh. Even if Scotland exited the UK, Elizabeth II would still remain 
queen of Scotland until the Scots voted for a republic. 
Politically, England, Wales, and Scotland came together in the 1707 Act 
of Union. Scotland retained its legal system, the Church of Scotland, and 
 administration of its educational institutions. The Scottish parliament was dis-
solved, and Scotland elected MPs to the Westminster Parliament in London. 
Scottish merchants, particularly those in Glasgow, promoted the 1707 Act 
of Union at a time when many Scots were trying to put the Stuarts back on 
the throne—merchants wanted to trade with the American colonies, own 
plantations in the West Indies, trade slaves and import goods into Glasgow, 
where families became wealthy merchants, bankers, and entrepreneurs. 
Once Scotland joined England and Wales in an expanding British empire, 
many Scots secured imperial roles as governors, military commanders, teach-
ers, clergymen, and merchants. 
At home, Scotland industrialized into textiles, coal, iron, steel, and shipbuilding. 
The Firth of Clyde became a world-renowned shipbuilding region. But today, the 
great nineteenth century industries are now gone or downsized, causing resent-
ment with the process of globalization. Scotland is now a service economy with 
major financial institutions, because when Scots made money in the nineteenth 
century they invested with insurance companies still based in Edinburgh. And 
these major financial institutions indicated they might move south of the border if 
Scotland voted itself out of the UK and the EU. 
The costs of separating from the UK would have been considerable for 
everyone. Scotland receives far more from the British treasury than it con-
tributes in taxes. Taxes on Scots would likely have been raised, especially 
since Scotland's share of North Sea oil is a depreciating asset. The Scots 
would have had to enlarge the machinery of government, and appoint 
ambassadors and consuls to represent the country overseas. Meanwhile 
the UK would have lost prestige and the value of the pound would have 
dropped, as it did briefly when polls indicated the possibility of an inde-
pendent Scotland. Britain's nuclear submarines, based in western Scotland, 
would have had to be moved to a new site constructed at great cost. Nev-
ertheless, despite these and other practical issues, the impulse in Scotland 
to separate from the UK may continue to draw supporters to the Scottish 
Nationalist Party. 
The lesson to be drawn from Scotland's independence movement is that 
geography matters. National boundaries, once fixed, are difficult to change. 
Meanwhile, national and cultural identities evolve, technologies change, and 
emigration and immigration alter the composition of populations. As a result, 
human geographies are complex and dynamic.

were initially unwilling to trade, and carry enough goods 
to be profitable. Naval power enabled the Portuguese and 
the Spanish to enrich their economies with gold and sil-
ver plundered from the Americas. The quadrant (1450) and 
the astrolabe (1480) enabled accurate navigation and map-
ping of ocean currents, prevailing winds, and trade routes. 
Europeans embarked on a succession of voyages of discov-
ery  (Figure 2.7), seeking out new products and new markets. 
The European voyages of discovery can be traced to Portu-
gal's Prince Henry the Navigator (1394-1460), who set up 
a school of navigation and financed numerous expeditions 
with the objective of circumnavigating Africa to establish a 
profitable sea route for spices from India. The knowledge of 
winds, ocean currents, natural harbors, and watering places 
amassed by Henry's captains was an essential foundation 
some resisted incorporation; and some sought alternative sys-
tems of economic and political organization. Australia and New 
Zealand, for example, were discovered by Europeans only in the 
late eighteenth century and were barely penetrated, if at all, by 
the European world-system. Regions not yet absorbed into the 
world-system are called external arenas.
Trade and Merchant Capitalism With the emergence of this 
modern world-system at the beginning of the sixteenth century, a 
whole new geography began to emerge. Although several regions of 
budding capitalist production existed, and although imperial China 
could boast of sophisticated achievements in science, technology, 
and navigation, it was European merchant capitalism that reshaped 
the world. Several factors motivated European overseas expan-
sion. A relatively high-density population and a limited amount of 
cultivable land meant that it was a continuous struggle to provide 
enough food. Meanwhile, the desire for overseas expansion was  
intensified both by competition among a large number of small 
monarchies and by inheritance laws that produced large numbers 
of impoverished aristocrats with little or no land of their own. 
Many of these landless nobles were eager to set out for adventure 
and profit.
Added to these motivating factors were the enabling fac-
tors of innovations in shipbuilding, navigation, and gunnery. 
In the mid-1400s, for example, the Portuguese developed a 
cannon-armed ship—the caravel—that could sail anywhere, 
defend itself against pirates, pose a threat to those who

good resource base, and strong governments were able to 
keep Europeans at arm's length. For the most part, 
these regions were in South and East Asia. Their 
dealings with Europeans constituted the sec-
ond major trading network, conducted 
through a series of coastal trading sta-
tions. Textiles were an important com-
modity, as reflected by the origin 
of certain words in the English 
language:
The word "satin" comes 
from the name of an un-
known city in China that 
Arab traders called Zai-
tun. "Khaki" is the Hindi 
word for "dusty." The 
word "calico" comes 
from India's southwest-
ern coastal city of Cali-
cut; "chintz," from the 
Hindi name for a printed 
calico; "cashmere," from 
Kashmir. "Percale" comes 
from the Farsi word parga-
lah. Another Farsi derivative 
is "seersucker," whose bands 
of alternating smooth and puck-
ered fabric prompted a name that 
literally means milk and sugar. Still 
another Farsi borrowing is "taffeta," 
which comes from the Farsi for "spun." 
The coarse cloth we call "muslin" is named 
for Mosul—the town in Iraq—while "damask" 
is a short form of  Damascus. Cotton takes its name 
from qutun, the  Arabic name of the fiber.1
Within Europe, meanwhile, innovations in business and 
finance (e.g., banking, loan systems, credit transfers, commer-
cial insurance, and courier services) helped increase savings, 
investment, and commercial activity. European merchants 
and manufacturers also became adept at import substitution—
copying and making goods previously available only by trad-
ing. The result was the emergence of Western Europe as the 
core region of a world-system that had penetrated and incorpo-
rated significant portions of the rest of the world.
For Europe, this overseas expansion stimulated still 
 further improvements in technology. These included new 
 developments in nautical mapmaking, naval artillery, 
shipbuilding, and sailing. The whole experience of over-
seas expansion also provided a great practical school for 
entrepreneurship and investment. In this way, the self- 
propelling growth of  merchant capitalism was intensified and 
consolidated.
For the periphery, European overseas expansion meant 
dependency (as it has ever since for many of the world's 
for the subsequent voyages of Cristóbal Colón  (Columbus), 
da Gama, de Magalhães (Magellan), and others. The end of 
the European Age of Discovery was marked by  Captain James 
Cook's voyages to the Pacific.
Equipped with better maps and navigation techniques, 
Europeans sent adventurers in search of gold and silver and 
also to commandeer land, decide on its use, and exploit coerced 
labor to produce high-value crops (such as sugar, cocoa, cot-
ton, and indigo) on plantations, large landholdings that usu-
ally specialize in the production of one particular crop for mar-
ket. From the sixteenth to the early nineteenth centuries, trade 
was dominated by two systems. One was the Triangular Trade 
system among Europe, West Africa, and the Caribbean and the 
eastern seaboard of North America (Figure 2.8). West African 
states sold their slaves to merchants who transported them to 
plantation owners in North America and Brazil. Sugar, rum, 
and indigo was shipped from Caribbean plantations to Europe 
and tobacco and cotton were shipped from Virginia and the 
Carolinas to Europe. The triangle was completed as European 
goods were exported to West Africa.

pean disease and which also had high population densities, a

peripheral regions). At worst, territory was forcibly occu-
pied and labor systematically exploited. At best, local traders 
were displaced by Europeans, who imposed their own terms 
of  economic exchange. Europeans soon destroyed most of the 
Muslim shipping trade in the Indian Ocean, for example, and 
went on to capture a large share of the oceangoing trade within 
Asia, selling Japanese copper to China and India, Persian 
carpets to India, and Indian cotton textiles to Japan.
Technology and Its Limitations As revolutionary as these 
changes were, however, they were constrained by a technology 
that rested on wind and water power, on wooden ships and 
structures, and on wood for fuel. Grain mills, for example, were 
built of wood and powered by water or wind. They could gener-
ate only modest amounts of power and only at sites determined 
by physical geography, not human choice. Within the relatively 
small European landmass, wood grown for structural use and 
for fuel competed for acreage with food and textile fiber crops.
More important, however, were the inherent limits in the 
size and strength of timber (which imposed structural limits on 
the size of buildings), the diameter of waterwheels, the span 
of bridges, and so on. In particular, it imposed limits on the 
size and design of ships, which in turn imposed limits on the 
volume and velocity of world trade. The expense and relative 
inefficiency of horse- or ox-drawn wagons for overland trans-
portation also meant that for a long time the European world-
system could penetrate into continental interiors only along 
major rivers.
After 300 years of evolution, roughly between 1450 and 
1750, the world-system had incorporated only parts of the 
world. The principal spheres of European influence were Med-
iterranean North Africa, Portuguese and Spanish colonies in 
Central and South America, Indian ports and trading colonies, 
the East Indies, African and Chinese ports, the Greater Carib-
bean, and British and French territories in North America. The 
rest of the world functioned more or less as before, with slow-
changing geographies based on modified minisystems and 
world-empires that were only partially and intermittently pen-
etrated by market trading.

Core and Periphery in the New 
World-System
With the new production and transportation technologies 
of the Industrial Revolution (from the late 1700s), capitalism 
began to grow into a global system that reached into virtually 
every part of the inhabited world and into virtually every 
aspect of people's lives. It is important to recognize that the 
Industrial Revolution was really an extended transition to new 
forms of organization and new technologies and that its effects 
were uneven, reflecting the influence of principles of spatial 
organization. In Europe, the cradle of the Industrial Revolu-
tion, it took the best part of a century for industrialization to 
work its way across European landscapes, with very different 
outcomes for different regions.
The Industrialization of Europe The Industrial Revolu-
tion began in England toward the end of the eighteenth century 
and eventually resulted not only in the complete reorgani-
zation of the geography of the original European core of the 
world-system but also in an extension of the world-system core 
to the United States and Japan.
In Europe, three distinctive waves of industrialization 
occurred. The first, between about 1790 and 1850, was based 
on the initial cluster of industrial technologies (steam engines, 
cotton textiles, and ironworking) and was very localized 
 (Figure 2.9). It was limited to a few regions in Britain where 
▲ Figure 2.9 The spread of industrialization in Europe European in-
dustrialization began with the emergence of small industrial regions in several 
parts of Britain, drawing on local mineral resources, water power, and nascent 
industrial technologies. As new technologies emerged, industrialization 
spread to other regions with the right locational attributes: access to raw ma-
terials and energy sources, good communications, and large labor markets.

as well as for external colonization and imperialism (the 
deliberate exercise of military power and economic influ-
ence by powerful states to advance and secure their national 
interests—see Chapter 8).
Since the seventeenth century, the world-system has 
been consolidated, with stronger economic ties between 
countries. It has also been extended, with all the world's 
countries eventually becoming involved to some extent in 
the interdependence of the capitalist system. Although there 
have been some instances of resistance and adaptation, 
the overall result is that a highly structured relationship 
between places and regions has emerged. This relationship 
is organized around three tiers: core, semiperipheral, and 
peripheral regions. These broad geographic divisions have 
evolved—and are still evolving—through a combination of 
processes of private economic competition and competition 
among states.
The core regions of the world-system at any given time are 
those that dominate trade, control the most advanced technolo-
gies, and have high levels of productivity within diversified 
economies. As a result, they enjoy relatively high per capita 
incomes. The first core regions of the world-system were the 
trading hubs of Holland and England, joined soon afterward 
by France. By the end of the nineteenth century, the core of the 
world-system had extended to include the United States and 
Japan; and today it includes Scandinavia and most of Western 
Europe (Figure 2.10). But the continuing success of core regions 
depends on their dominance and exploitation of other regions. 
This dominance in turn depends on the participation of these 
other regions within the world-system. Initially, such partici-
pation was achieved by military enforcement, then by Euro-
pean colonialism.
Colonialism involves the establishment and maintenance 
of political and legal domination by a state over a separate and 
alien society. This domination usually involves some coloniza-
tion (i.e., the physical settlement of people from the coloniz-
ing state) and always results in economic exploitation by the 
colonizing state. After World War II, the sheer economic and 
political influence of the core regions was sufficient to main-
tain their dominance without political and legal control, and 
colonialism was gradually phased out.
Regions that have remained economically and politi-
cally unsuccessful throughout this process of incorporation 
into the world-system are peripheral. Peripheral regions are  
characterized by dependent and disadvantageous trading rela-
tionships, by primitive or obsolescent technologies, and by 
undeveloped or narrowly specialized economies with low  
levels of productivity.
Transitional between core regions and peripheral regions 
are semiperipheral regions. Semiperipheral regions are able 
to exploit peripheral regions but are themselves exploited and 
dominated by core regions. They consist mostly of countries 
that were once peripheral. The existence of this semiperiph-
eral category underlines the fact that neither peripheral status 
nor core status is necessarily permanent. The United States and 
Japan both achieved core status after having been peripheral; 
Spain and Portugal, part of the original core in the sixteenth 
industrial entrepreneurs and workforces had first exploited 
key innovations and the availability of key resources (coal, 
iron ore, water). Although these regions shared the com-
mon impetus of certain key innovations, each of them 
retained its own technological traditions and industrial style. 
From the start, then, industrialization was a regional-scale 
phenomenon.
The second wave of industrialization, between about 1850 
and 1870, involved the diffusion of industrialization to most 
of the rest of Britain and to parts of northwest Europe, particu-
larly the coalfields of northern France, Belgium, and Germany. 
This second wave also brought a certain amount of change to 
the geographies of first-wave industrial regions as new tech-
nologies (steel, machine tools, railroads, steamships) brought 
new opportunities, new locational requirements, new business 
structures, and new forms of societal organization. Railroads 
and steamships made more places accessible, bringing their 
resources and their markets into the sphere of industrializa-
tion. These new activities brought some significant changes to 
the logic of industrial location.
The importance of railway networks, for example, attracted 
industry away from smaller towns on the canal systems toward 
larger towns with good rail connections. The importance of 
steamships for coastal and international trade attracted indus-
try to larger ports. At the same time, the importance of steel 
produced concentrations of heavy industry in places that had 
nearby supplies of coal, iron ore, and limestone. By the out-
break of the First World War in 1914, industrialization had 
spread to parts of southern and eastern Europe where there 
were coalfields, concentrations of population, and good trans-
port connections. The scale of industry increased as improved 
technologies and transportation made larger markets accessible 
to firms. Local, family firms became small companies that were 
regional in scope. Small companies grew to become powerful 
firms serving national markets. Specialized business, legal, and 
financial services emerged within larger cities. The growth of 
new occupations transformed the structure of social classes, 
and this transformation in turn was reflected in the politics 
and landscapes of industrial regions.

Colonialism and Imperialism Human geographies were 
recast again, this time with a more interdependent dynamic. 
New production technologies, based on more efficient en-
ergy sources, helped raise levels of productivity and create 
new and better products that stimulated demand, increased 
profits, and created a pool of capital for further investment. 
New transportation technologies triggered successive phases 
of geographic expansion, allowing for internal development

century, became semiperipheral in the nine-
teenth century but are now once more part 
of the core. Quite a few countries, including 
Brazil, India, Mexico, South Korea, and Tai-
wan, have become semiperipheral after first 
having been incorporated into the periphery 
of the world-system and then developing a 
successful manufacturing sector.
An important determinant of these 
changes in status is the effectiveness of 
states in ensuring the international competi-
tiveness of their domestic producers. They 
can do this in several ways:
■ Manipulating markets (e.g., protecting 
domestic manufacturers by charging 
taxes on imports)
■ Regulating their economies (e.g., enact-
ing laws that help establish stable labor 
markets)
■ Creating physical and social infrastruc-
tures (spending public funds on road 
systems, ports, educational systems, 
etc.).
Because some states are more successful 
than others in pursuing these strategies, the 
hierarchy of the three geographical tiers is 
not rigid. Rather, it is fluid, providing a con-
tinually changing framework for geographi-
cal transformation within individual places 
and regions.
Leadership Cycles The colonization and 
imperialism that accompanied the expansion 
of the world-system was closely tied to the 
evolution of world leadership cycles. Leader-
ship cycles are periods of international power 
established by individual states through eco-
nomic, political, and military competition. 
In the long term, success in the world-system 
depends on economic strength and competi-
tiveness, which brings political influence and 
pays for military strength. With a combination 
of economic, political, and military power,  
individual states can dominate the world-sys-
tem, setting the terms for many economic and 
cultural practices and imposing their particular 
ideology by virtue of their preeminence. The 
modern world-system has so far experienced 
several distinct  leadership cycles. In simpli-
fied terms, they have involved dominance by 
 Portugal (for most of the sixteenth century), 
the  Netherlands (for the first three-quarters of 
the seventeenth century), Great Britain (from 
the early eighteenth century through the early 
twentieth century), and the United States 
(from the 1950s)—see Chapter 11.

CHAPTER 2   The Changing Global Context   71
The result was that colonial economies were founded on nar-
row specializations that were oriented to and dependent upon 
the needs of core countries. Examples of these specializations 
were many: bananas in Central America; cotton in India; coffee in 
Brazil, Java, and Kenya; copper in Chile; cocoa in Ghana; jute in 
East Pakistan (now Bangladesh); palm oil in West Africa; rubber 
in Malaya (now Malaysia) and Sumatra; sugar in the Caribbean 
islands; tea in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka); tin in Bolivia; and baux-
ite in Guyana and Surinam. Most of these specializations persist 
today. For example, 45 of the 55 countries in sub-Saharan Africa 
still depend on just three products—tea, cocoa, and coffee—for 
more than half of their export earnings.
This new global economic geography took some time to 
establish, and the details of its pattern and timing were heav-
ily influenced by technological innovations. The incorpora-
tion of the temperate grasslands into the commercial orbit of 
the core countries, for example, involved changes in regional 
landscapes resulting from critical innovations—such as barbed 
wire, the railroad, and refrigeration.
The single most important innovation stimulating the 
international division of labor, however, was the development 
of metal-hulled, oceangoing steamships (Figure 2.11). This 
development was cumulative, with improvements in engines, 
boilers, transmission systems, fuel systems, and construction 
This kind of dominance is known as hegemony. Hegemony 
refers to domination over the world economy, exercised—through 
a combination of economic, military, financial, and cultural 
means—by one national state in a particular historical epoch. Over 
the long run, the costs of maintaining this kind of power and influ-
ence tend to weaken the hegemony. This phase of the cycle, when 
the dominant nation is weakened, is known as imperial over-
stretch. It is followed by another period of competitive struggle, 
which brings the possibility of a new dominant world power.

Organizing the Periphery
The growth and internal development of the core regions simply 
could not have taken place without the foodstuffs, raw materials, 
and markets provided by the colonization of the periphery and the 
incorporation of more and more territory into the sphere of indus-
trial capitalism. Early in the nineteenth century, the industrial core 
nations embarked on the penetration of the world's inland mid-
continental grassland zones to exploit them for grain or livestock 
production. This led to the settlement, through the emigration of 
European peoples, of the temperate prairies and pampas of the 
Americas, the veld in southern Africa, the Murray-Darling Plain in 
Australia, and the Canterbury Plain in New Zealand. At the same 
time, as the demand for tropical plantation products (e.g., sugar, 
cotton, coffee, cocoa, and rubber) increased, most of the tropical 
world came under the political and economic control—direct or 
indirect—of one or another of the industrial core nations. In the 
second half of the nineteenth century, and especially after 1870, 
there was a vast increase in the number of colonies and the num-
ber of people under colonial rule.
The International Division of Labor The fundamental 
logic behind all this colonization was economic: the need for an 
extended arena for trade, an arena that could supply foodstuffs 
and raw materials in return for the industrial goods of the core. 
The outcome was an international division of labor, driven by 
the needs of the core and imposed through its economic and 
military strength. This division of labor involved the specializa-
tion of different people, regions, and countries in certain kinds 
of economic activities. In particular, colonies began to special-
ize in the production of commodities meeting certain criteria:
■ where an established demand existed in the industrial 
core (e.g., for foodstuffs and industrial raw materials);
■ where colonies held a comparative advantage in spe-
cializations that did not duplicate or compete with the 
domestic suppliers within core countries (e.g., tropical ag-
ricultural products like cocoa and bananas simply could 
not be grown in core countries).

of these goods, together with imports of food from its dominion 
states (Canada, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand) and 
colonies, through the export of its own manufactured goods 
to peripheral countries. India and China, with large domes-
tic markets, were especially important. A widening circle of 
exchange and dependence developed, with constantly shifting 
patterns of trade and investment.

parative advantage? 
Imperialism: Imposing New Geographies on the 
World The incorporation of the periphery was by no means 
entirely motivated by this basic logic of free trade and invest-
ment. Although Britain was the dominant power in the late 
nineteenth century, several other European countries (nota-
bly Germany, France, and the Netherlands), together with the 
United States—and later Japan—were competing for global in-
fluence. This competition developed into a scramble for terri-
torial and commercial domination. The core countries engaged 
in preemptive geographic expansion-
ism to protect their established inter-
ests and to limit the opportunities of 
others. They also wanted to secure as 
much of the world as possible—through 
a combination of military oversight, 
administrative control, and economic 
regulation—to ensure stable and profit-
able environments for their traders and 
investors.
This combination of circumstances 
defined a new era of imperialism in the 
final quarter of the nineteenth century. 
Africa, more than any other periph-
eral region, was given an entirely new 
geography. It was carved up into a 
patchwork of European colonies and 
protectorates in just 34 years, between 
1880 and 1914 (Figure 2.13), with little 
regard for either physical geography or 
the preexisting minisystems and world-
empires. Whereas European interest 
had previously focused on coastal trad-
ing stations and garrison ports, it now 
extended to the entire continent.
Within just a few years, the whole 
of Africa became incorporated into the 
materials adding up to produce dramatic improvements in  
carrying capacity, speed, range, and reliability. The Suez Canal 
(opened in 1869) and the Panama Canal (opened in 1914) 
were also critical, providing shorter and less hazardous routes 
between core countries and colonial ports of call. By the eve of 
World War I, the world economy was effectively integrated by 
a system of regularly scheduled steamship trading routes. This 
integration, in turn, was supported by the second most impor-
tant innovation stimulating the international division of labor: 
a network of telegraph communications that enabled busi-
nesses to monitor and coordinate supply and demand across 
vast distances on an hourly basis.
The international division of labor brought about a sub-
stantial increase in trade and a huge surge in the overall size 
of the capitalist world economy. The peripheral regions of 
the world contributed a great deal to this growth. By 1913, 
Africa and Asia provided more exports to the world economy 
than either North America or the British Isles. Asia alone was 
importing almost as much, by value, as North America. The 
industrializing countries of the core bought increasing amounts 
of foodstuffs and raw materials from the periphery, financed by 
profits from the export of machinery and manufactured goods. 
Britain, the hegemonic power of the period, drew on a trading 
empire that was truly global (Figure 2.12).
Patterns of international trade and interdependence 
became increasingly complex. Britain used its capital to invest 
not only in peripheral regions but also in profitable industries 
in other core countries, especially the United States. At the 
same time, these other core countries were able to export cheap 
manufactured items to Britain. Britain financed the purchase 
▲ Figure 2.12 The British Empire in the late 1800s Protected by the all-powerful Royal Navy, the British 
merchant navy established a web of commerce that collected food for British industrial workers and raw 
materials for its industries, much of it from colonies and dependencies appropriated by imperial might and 
developed by British capital. Its trading empire was so successful that Britain became the hub of trade for 
other states. (Source: Adapted from P. Hugill, World Trade Since 1431. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1993, p. 136.)

CHAPTER 2   The Changing Global Context   75
The Struggle for Independence
The imperial world order began to disintegrate shortly after 
World War II, however. The United States emerged as the 
new hegemonic power, the dominant state within the world-
system core. The Soviet Union and China, opting for alterna-
tive, socialist paths of development for themselves and their 
satellite countries, were seen as a Second World, withdrawn 
from the capitalist world economy. Their pursuit of alternative 
political economies was based on radically different values.
By the 1950s, many of the old European colonies began to 
seek political independence. Some of the early independence 
struggles were very bloody because the colonial powers were 
initially reluctant to withdraw from colonies where strategic 
resources or large numbers of European settlers were involved. 
In Kenya, in the early 1950s, for example, a militant nation-
alist movement known as the Mau Mau launched a campaign 
of terrorism, sabotage, and assassination against British colo-
nists. They killed more than 2,000 white settlers between 1952 
and 1956; in return, 11,000 Mau Mau rebels were killed by 
the colonial army and 20,000 put into detention camps by the 
colonial administration. By the early 1960s, however, the pro-
cess of decolonization had become relatively smooth. (In 1962, 
Jomo Kenyatta, who had been jailed as a Mau Mau leader in 
1953, became prime minister of a newly independent Kenya.) 
The periphery of the world-system now consisted of politi-
cally independent states, some of which adopted a policy of 
nonalignment; that is, they were not formally aligned with or 
against either the United States or the Soviet Union.
Neocolonialism and Transnational Corporations As 
newly independent peripheral states struggled from the 1960s 
onward to be free of their economic dependence through 
industrialization, modernization, and trade, the capitalist 
world-system became increasingly integrated and interdepen-
dent. The old imperial patterns of international trade broke 
down and were replaced by more complex patterns. Never-
theless, the newly independent states were still influenced 
by many of the old colonial links and legacies that remained 
intact. The result was a neocolonial pattern of international 
development.
Neocolonialism refers to economic and political strate-
gies by which powerful states in core economies indirectly 
maintain or extend their influence over other areas or people. 
Instead of formal, direct rule (colonialism), controls are exerted 
through such strategies as international financial regulations, 
commercial relations, and covert intelligence operations. 
Through neocolonialism, the human geographies of periph-
eral countries continued to be heavily shaped by the linguis-
tic, cultural, political, and institutional influence of the former 
colonial powers as well as by their investment and trading 
activities.
At about the same time, a new form of imperialism was 
emerging. This was the commercial imperialism of giant corpo-
rations. These corporations had grown within the core countries 
through the elimination of smaller firms by mergers and take-
overs. By the 1960s, quite a few of them had become so big that 
they were transnational in scope, having established overseas  
modern world-system, with a geography that consisted of a 
hierarchy of three kinds of spaces:
■ One consisted of regions and localities organized by 
European colonial administrators and European investors 
to produce commodities for the world market.
■ A second consisted of zones of production for local markets 
where peasant farmers produced food for consumption by 
laborers engaged in commercial mining and agriculture.
■ The third consisted of widespread regions of subsistence 
agriculture whose connection with the world-system was 
as a source of labor for the commercial regions.
Meanwhile, the major powers also jostled and squabbled 
over small Pacific islands that had suddenly become valuable 
as strategic coaling stations for their navies and merchant fleets. 
Resistance from indigenous peoples was quickly brushed aside 
by imperial navies with ironclad steamers, high-explosive 
guns, and troops with rifles and cannons. European weap-
onry was so superior that Otto von Bismarck, the founder and 
first chancellor (1871-1890) of the German empire, referred 
to these conflicts as "sporting wars." Between 1870 and 1900, 
European countries added almost 22 million square kilometers  
(8.5 million square miles) and 150 million people to their 
spheres of control—20 percent of the Earth's land surface and 
10 percent of its population.
The imprint of imperialism and colonization on the  
geographies of the newly incorporated peripheries of the 
world-system was immediate and profound. The periphery 
was rendered almost entirely dependent on European and 
North American capital, shipping, managerial expertise, finan-
cial services, and news and communications. Consequently, 
it also became dependent on European cultural products: lan-
guage, education, science, religion, architecture, and planning. 
All of these influences were etched into the landscapes of the 
periphery in a variety of ways as new places were created, old 
places were remade, and regions were reorganized.
Geography and Imperialism The discipline of geogra-
phy played an important role in providing a "scientific" ratio-
nale for the domination of peripheral countries by Europeans 
and North Americans. Prominent geographers argued that 
civilization and successful economic development are largely 
the result of "invigorating" temperate climates with marked 
seasonal variations and varied weather but without prolonged 
extremes of heat, humidity, or cold. Conversely, tropical cli-
mates, they asserted, limit people's vitality. This kind of 
reasoning reflects an underlying ethnocentrism and environ-
mental determinism. Ethnocentrism is the attitude that one's 
own race and culture are superior to those of others. Environ-
mental determinism is a doctrine holding that human activi-
ties are shaped and constrained by the environment. Most of 
the geographic writing in the nineteenth and early twentieth 
centuries was strongly influenced by this assumption that the 
physical attributes of geographical settings are the root not 
only of people's physical differences but also of differences 
in people's economic vitality, cultural activities, and social 
structures.

3. The scope of global connections is much broader and has 
multiple dimensions: economic, technological, political, 
legal, social, and cultural, among others.
4. The interactions and interdependencies among numerous 
global actors have created a new level of complexity for the 
relationships between places and regions.
Over the past 35 years, telecommunication technolo-
gies, corporate strategies, and institutional frameworks have 
combined to create a dynamic new geographical framework. 
Emerging information technologies have helped create a com-
plex and frenetic international financial system, while trans-
national corporations are now able to transfer their production 
activities from one part of the world to another in response to 
changing market conditions and changing transportation and 
communications technologies (see Chapter 8). Now products, 
markets, and organizations are both spread and linked across 
the globe. Governments, in their attempts to adjust to this situ-
ation, have sought new ways of dealing with the consequences 
of globalization, including unprecedented international politi-
cal and economic alliances such as NAFTA and the European 
Union (see Chapter 10).
The economic basis of contemporary globalization 
depends on myriad commodity chains that crisscross global 
space. Commodity chains are networks of labor and produc-
tion processes that originate in the extraction or production 
of raw materials and whose end result is the delivery and 
consumption of a finished commodity (see Box 2.2, "Visual-
izing Geography: Commodity Chains"). These networks often 
span countries and continents, linking into vast global assem-
bly lines the production and supply of raw materials, the 
processing of raw materials, the production of components, 
the assembly of finished products, and the distribution of 
finished products. As we shall see in Chapter 8, these global 
assembly lines are increasingly important in shaping places 
and regions.
Globalization also has important cultural dimensions 
(see Chapter 5). One is quite simply the diffusion around the 
world of all sorts of cultural forms, practices, and artifacts that 
had previously been confined to specific places or regions. 
Examples include "ethnic" and regional cuisine, "world" 
music, Caribbean carnivals, and "charismatic" Christian 
sects. Another dimension of cultural globalization derives 
from consumer culture: everything that is sold in interna-
tional markets, from sneakers, replica soccer shirts, and auto-
mobiles to movies and rock concert tours. This had led some 
observers to believe that globalization is producing a new set 
of universally shared images, practices, and values—literally, 
a global culture.
All this adds up to an intensified global connectedness and 
the beginnings of the world as an interdependent system. Or, to 
be more precise, this is how it adds up for the 900 million or 
so of the world's people who are directly tied to global systems 
of production and consumption and who have access to global 
networks of communication and knowledge. All of us in this 
globalizing world are in the middle of a major reorganization of 
the world economy and a radical change in our relationships to 
other people and places.
subsidiaries, taken over foreign competitors, or simply bought 
into profitable foreign businesses.
These transnational corporations have investments and 
activities that span international boundaries, with subsidiary 
companies, factories, offices, or facilities in several coun-
tries. Examples of transnational corporations include Airbus, 
BP, Halliburton, News Corporation, Siemens, and the Virgin 
Group. By 2007, over 79,000 transnational corporations were 
operating, 90 percent of which were headquartered in the 
core states. These corporations control about 790,000 foreign 
affiliates and account for the equivalent of 11 percent of world 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and one-third of world exports.
Transnational corporations have been portrayed as imperial-
ist by some geographers because of their ability and willingness 
to exercise their considerable power in ways that adversely affect 
peripheral states. They have certainly been central to a major new 
phase of geographical restructuring that has been taking place for 
the last 35 years or so. This phase has been distinctive because 
an unprecedented amount of economic, political, social, and cul-
tural activity has spilled beyond the geographic and institutional 
boundaries of states. It is a phase of globalization, a much fuller 
integration of the economies of the worldwide system of states 
and a much greater interdependence of individual places and 
regions from every part of the world-system.

CONTEMPORARY GLOBALIZATION
Globalization is the increasing interconnectedness of differ-
ent parts of the world through common processes of economic, 
environmental, political, and cultural change. As we have seen, 
globalization has been underway since the inception of the mod-
ern world-system in the sixteenth century. In the nineteenth 
century, when the competitive system of states fostered the 
emergence of international agencies and institutions, global net-
works of communication, a standardized system of global time, 
international law, and internationally shared notions of citizen-
ship and human rights, the basic framework of modern global-
ization came into being. Global connections today, though, differ 
in at least four important ways from those in the past:
 1. They function at much greater speed than ever before.
 2. Globalization operates on a much larger scale, leaving few 
people unaffected and wielding its influence in even the 
most remote places.

CHAPTER 2   The Changing Global Context   77
and interdependent as a result of globalization, others have been 
bypassed or excluded. In short, there is no one experience of glo-
balization. The reality is that globalization is variously embraced, 
resisted, subverted, and exploited as it makes contact with spe-
cific cultures and settings. In the process, places are modified or 
reconstructed rather than destroyed or homogenized.
Key Issues in a Globalizing World
The integrated global system has increased awareness of a set of 
common problems—climate change, pollution, disease, crime, 
poverty, and inequality—that many see as a consequence of 
globalization. The globalization of the contemporary world—
its causes and effects on specific aspects of human geographies 
at different spatial scales—is a recurring theme through the 
rest of this book. Here, we note in broad outline the principal 
issues associated with contemporary globalization.
Environmental Issues The sheer scale and capacity of the 
world economy means that humans are now capable of alter-
ing the environment at the global scale. The "footprint" of hu-
mankind extends to more than four-fifths of Earth's surface  
(Figure 2.14). Many of the important issues facing modern 
 society are the consequences—intended and unintended—of 
 human modifications of our physical environment.
Humans have altered the balance of nature in ways that 
have brought economic prosperity to some areas and created 
environmental dilemmas and crises in others. For example, 
At first glance it might seem that globalization will render 
geography obsolete—especially in the more developed parts of 
the world. High-tech communications and the global marketing 
of standardized products seem as if they might soon wash away 
the distinctiveness of people and places, permanently diminish-
ing the importance of differences between places. Far from it. 
The new mobility of money, labor, products, and ideas actually 
increases the significance of place in some very important ways:
■ The more universal the diffusion of material culture and 
lifestyles, the more valuable regional and ethnic identities 
become.
■ The faster the information highway takes people into cyber-
space, the more they feel the need for a subjective setting—a 
specific place or community—they can call their own.
■ The greater the reach of transnational corporations, the 
more easily they are able to respond to place-to-place vari-
ations in labor markets and consumer markets. As a result, 
economic geography has to be reorganized more frequently 
and more radically.
■ The greater the integration of transnational governments 
and institutions, the more sensitive people have become to 
local cleavages of race, ethnicity, and religion.
For some places and regions, globalization is a central 
 reality; for others, it is still a marginal influence. While some 
places and regions have become more closely interconnected

tion Society and Columbia University's Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN),

Global commodity chains link the progression of a commod-
ity from design through procurement of raw materials and 
production to import or export to the point of sale, distribution 
for sale, marketing, and advertising.
Almost every mass-marketed manufactured product involves 
a complex commodity chain. Here we look at the manufac-
ture of cell phones.
Much of the world's electronic waste, including cell phones, ﬁnds 
its way back to China. Tons of discarded cell phones and other 
electronic waste also make their way into China via Hong Kong 
and Vietnam. Informal e-waste treatment methods such as open 
burning and acid stripping of electronic components leads to 
severe health and environmental hazards.
Advances in telecommunications, management techniques, transportation, ﬁnance, and other services to industry have made possible 
the segmentation of corporate production lines and services. Manufacturing companies now design a product in one country, have it 
produced by contractors in various countries continents apart, sell the product with its brand name by telephone or Internet almost 
anywhere in the world, and have other contractors deliver it. These services—design, sales, ﬁnancing, and delivery—can be undertaken 
without the various actors ever meeting face to face. Advances in technology and management permit the reproduction and standardiza-
tion of services and products on a global basis.
More than 70% of mobile devices today can be reused but 
only 14-17% are recycled annually.

HUMAN GEOGRAPHY   Places and Regions in Global Context
clearing land for settlement, mining, and agriculture provides 
livelihoods and homes for some but also transforms human 
populations, wildlife, and vegetation. The inevitable by- 
products—garbage, air and water pollution, hazardous wastes, 
and so forth—place enormous demands on the capacity of 
physical systems to absorb and accommodate them.
Climate change as a result of human activity—in particu-
lar, our burning of fossil fuels, agriculture, and deforestation 
that cause emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other "green-
house" gases—also has profound implications for environmen-
tal quality. Without concerted action to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions, the global average surface temperature is likely to 
rise by a further 1.8-4.0°C this century. Since preindustrial 
times, even the lower end of this range would experience a 
temperature increase above 2°C, the threshold beyond which 
irreversible and possibly catastrophic changes become far more 
likely. Projected global warming this century is likely to trigger 
serious consequences for humanity and other life forms. These 
consequences may include a rise in sea levels of between 18 
and 59 centimeters (which will endanger coastal areas and 
small islands) and a greater frequency and severity of extreme 
weather events.
In addition to the specter of global warming, we are fac-
ing serious global environmental degradation through defor-
estation, desertification, acid rain, loss of genetic diversity, 
smog, soil erosion, groundwater depletion, and the pollution  
of rivers, lakes, and oceans. The fate of Lake Baikal, in Rus-
sia (Figure 2.15), provides a distressing example. It is a place of 
incredible beauty—"the Pearl of Siberia"—that has long been 
emblematic of the pristine wilderness of the region. The lake 
holds 20 percent of the world's freshwater and is home to 2,500 
species, many of them found nowhere else, such as the world's 
only exclusively freshwater seal.
The lake has warmed 1.21°C (2.18°F) since 1946 due to 
climate change, almost three times faster than global air tem-
peratures. The lake's purity and unique ecosystem have also 
been compromised by environmental mismanagement. When 
thousands of the lake's freshwater seals began dying in 1997, 
the lake's fragile ecology came under international scrutiny, 
and in 1998 the lake was designated a World Heritage Site by 
UNESCO, the UN cultural agency. In 2007, the Russian govern-
ment declared the Baikal region a Special Economic Zone, to 
encourage tourism. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen whether 
Russia can solve its environmental problems at a time when its 
economy is still in transition.
Environmental issues such as these point to the importance 
of sustainability. Sustainability is about the interdependence 
of the economy, the environment, and social well-being. This 
is often couched in terms of the "three Es" of sustainable devel-
opment, referring to the environment, the economy, and equity 
in society (Figure 2.16). The oft-quoted definition of sustainable 
development from the Brundtland Report, which examined the 
issues on the international scale, is "development that meets 
the needs of the present without compromising the ability of 
future generations to meet their own needs."2
▼ Figure 2.15 Lake Baikal, Russia Lake Baikal is the world's deepest lake, at 1,615 meters (5,300 feet—over a mile), and 
contains about 20 percent of all the freshwater on Earth—more than North America's five Great Lakes combined.

APPLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE
1. How is climate change the result of human activity? Think about 
the example of Lake Baikal in your answer and how industry,  
governmental policy, and management affect the natural 
environment.
2. Give an example of an environmental concern that affects your 
home region and suggest how it relates to issues of economic de-
velopment and social equity. 
Health Issues The increased intensity of international 
trade and travel has also heightened the risk and speed of the 
spread of disease. A striking example of the health risks asso-
ciated with increasing interdependency has been the spread 
of the MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) virus. First 
reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, MERS is a coronavirus, 
in the same family as the severe acute respiratory syndrome 
(SARS) virus that caused an international epidemic in 2003 
infecting around 8,000 people and killing more than 700 of 
them before it was stopped. By 2014, MERS cases had been 
reported in a dozen other countries.
Today, health care professionals are concerned that a new 
strain of influenza virus is likely to result in an influenza pan-
demic. A pandemic is an epidemic that spreads rapidly around 
the world with high rates of illness and death. Entirely new 
flu strains develop several times each century. Because no 
one has a chance to develop immunity to a new flu strain, it 
can spread rapidly and widely—and especially so in today's 
globalized and highly interconnected world. Similarly, there 
is serious concern about the possibility of epidemics in the 
human population resulting from zoonotic diseases (diseases 
originating with other species, e.g., anthrax, avian flu, ebola, 
West Nile virus).
Security Issues As sociologist Ulrich Beck has pointed out, 
the high degree of interdependence that is now embedded in a 
globalizing and highly interconnected world has brought about 
all sorts of security issues. In traditional societies, the risks 
faced by individuals and groups were associated mostly with 
hazards generated by nature (disease, flood, famine, etc.), along 
with socially determined hazards such as invasion and con-
quest and regressive forms of thought and culture. The indus-
trial societies of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, with 
more powerful technologies and weaponry, faced still more 
hazards, but they were mostly local and  regional in nature.
Contemporary society, Beck points out, is characterized by 
another set of hazards, many of them uncontrollable and with 
a global reach. Examples include climate change as a result of 
human activity; the spread of weapons of mass destruction (i.e., 
nuclear and biological warfare); the risk of accidents involving 
radiation or contamination by radioactivity from nuclear fuel 
or nuclear waste; the risk of epidemics in the human popula-
tion resulting from zoonotic diseases; the risk of epidemic dis-
ease in food animals (such as the devastating outbreak of foot-
and-mouth disease, which affects cattle and sheep, in parts 
of northwestern Europe in 2001); and the risk of catastrophic 
instability in global financial markets.
Overall, Beck argues, we are moving toward a risk 
society, in which the significance of wealth distribution 
is being eclipsed by the distribution of risk and in which 
politics—both domestic and international—is increasingly 
about avoiding hazards. As a result, knowledge—especially 
scientific knowledge—becomes increasingly important as a 
source of power, while science itself becomes increasingly 
politicized—as, for example, in the case of global warming. 
Increased awareness of the multiple risks faced by places and 
regions has focused attention on the concept of resilience. 
Resilience is the ability of people, organizations or systems 
to prepare for, respond, recover from and thrive in the face 
of hazards. The goal is to ensure the continuity and advance-
ment of economic prosperity, business success, environmen-
tal quality, and human well-being, despite external threats. 
In a globalized world, only the most resilient places and 
regions will remain economically competitive and attrac-
tive for business growth, and capable of adapting to continu-
ally changing conditions. Resilience requires the capacity to 
reorganize, and the ability to create and sustain the capac-
ity to learn and adapt to change. Both are attributes that are 
more widespread in core regions than in semiperipheral and 
peripheral regions.

2.3 Window on the World
In 2012, Hurricane Sandy tracked up the Atlantic coast of the United 
States, leaving a trail of damage estimated at $65 billion. The storm 
surge caused especially severe problems in New Jersey and New York  
(Figures 2.B, 2.D), and focused attention on the vulnerability of coastal 
communities. Twenty-three of the most populous counties in the United 
States are located on the coast, most of them on the Atlantic seaboard. 
Their vulnerability to Atlantic storms and hurricanes is rapidly increasing 
because of climate change and, in particular, sea level rise. Since 1980, 
the 600-mile stretch of Atlantic coastline between Cape Hatteras, North 
Carolina and Boston, Massachusetts, has experienced a rise in sea level 
that is between three and four times the global average. The consensus 
among scientists is that a significant rise in sea level—a meter or more—will 
occur in the next 80-90 years. In 2009, the U.S. Global Change Research 
Program had detailed the vulnerabilities of the mid-Atlantic coast of the 
United States,1 noting that:
■ rates of relative sea level rise in the mid-Atlantic region were higher 
than the global average and generally ranged between 0.1 and 0.2 
inches per year;
■ many tidal wetlands were already on the decline, in part from rising sea 
levels; and
■ if sea level rises 39 inches (one meter) in the next century, most wet-
lands will be lost and many narrow barrier islands may disintegrate.

The impacts are likely to intensify the problems that coastal 
areas already face, including shoreline erosion (Figure 2.C), 
flooding, water pollution, damage to homes and infrastructure, 
and damage to natural ecosystems. Maine is preparing for a rise 
in sea level of up to 2 meters by 2100, and Delaware is develop-
ing contingency plans for a rise of 1.5 meters. Increasing resil-
ience against the impacts of sea level rise and climate change 
means investing heavily in infrastructure and imposing planning 
controls on residential development. But some local govern-
ments, influenced by real estate interests and property owners 
and fearful of discouraging investment, have passed resolutions 
against sea level rise policies. In North Carolina, where a state 
panel of engineers and scientists concluded that the sea will 
likely rise 39 inches by 2100, the legislature passed a bill in 2012 
placing a 4-year ban on acknowledging rising sea levels when 
considering coastal development within the state. At risk are 
more than 30,500 homes and other buildings, including some of 
the state's most expensive real estate. But pressure from devel-
opers meant that, rather than using any projection at all, the leg-
islature elected to wait until a new study is completed in 2016.

coastal regions?

experts? Do an Internet search to find another exam-
ple of this type of debate.

HUMAN GEOGRAPHY   Places and Regions in Global Context
One of the most striking outcomes of contemporary globalization is the 
consolidation of the core of the world-system. The core is now a close-knit 
triad of the geographic centers of North America, the European Union, and 
Japan. These three geographic centers are connected through three main 
circuits, or flows, of investment, trade, and communication: between Europe 
and North America, between Europe and the Far East, and among the re-
gions of the Pacific Rim.
Globalization, although incorporating more of the world more com-
pletely into the capitalist world-system, has intensified differences in pros-
perity between the core and the periphery.
According to the United Nations Development Program, the gap be-
tween the poorest fifth of the world's population and the wealthiest fifth 
increased more than threefold between 1965 and 2012. Some parts of the 
periphery have almost slid off the economic map. In 55 countries, per capita 
income actually fell during the 1990s. In sub-Saharan Africa, economic out-
put fell by one-third during the 1980s and stayed low during the 1990s and 
2000s, so that people's standard of living there is now, on average, lower 
than it was in the early 1960s. In 2010, the fifth of the world's population liv-
ing in the highest-income countries had:
■ 75 percent of world income (the bottom fifth had just 1 percent); and
■ 84 percent of world export markets (the bottom fifth had just  
1 percent).
While 3 billion people around the world struggle to live on less than 
U.S.$2.00 a day, the world's billionaires—only 1,000 or so people—were 
together worth U.S.$3.5 trillion (equivalent to more than 5 percent of 
world GDP). OECD countries (the Organization for Economic  Cooperation 
and Development, an association of 30 industrialized countries), with  
19 percent of the global population, control more than 75 percent of global

Figure 2.E shows the distribution of global population (the brighter the 
dot, the more the people) and their national average annual income. The 
disparities are the legacy of the historical geography of the world-system 
described in this chapter.
Such enormous differences lead many people to question the equity of 
the geographical consequences of globalization. The concept of spatial 
justice is important here because it requires us to consider the distribu-
tion of society's benefits and burdens at different spatial scales, taking into 
account both variations in people's need and in their contribution to the 
production of wealth and social well-being.
Many people, nations, and ethnic groups around the world feel margin-
alized, exploited, and neglected as a result of the quickening pace of change. 
Across much of the peripheral world, the perception of injustice has been 
brewing for a long time. Resentment at past colonial and imperial exploitation 
has been compounded as the more affluent places and regions of the world 
have become increasingly dependent on the cheap labor and resources 
of the periphery and as transnational businesses have displaced the tradi-
tional economic and social practices of peripheral and semiperipheral re-
gions under the banner of modernization. Thinking about spatial justice is an 
important aspect of the "geographical imagination" described in Chapter 1  
and is a recurring theme in the remainder of this book.
 
1. Why are the wealth disparities more extreme between the core 
and periphery since 1965 and with increasing globalization? Why 
do you think the gap has widened?
 
2. Can you find an example of a spatial justice project, law, incentive, 
or the like that has attempted to balance economic disparity in a 
city, town, country, or neighborhood?

States, the world's only superpower. Although Americans 
do not like to think of their country as territorially aggres-
sive or exploitative, the "war on terror" and invasion of 
Afghanistan and Iraq following the al-Qaeda attacks in 2001 
are widely interpreted elsewhere in the world as an exer-
cise in imperialism, motivated in large part by a desire for  
military control over global oil resources. This interpreta-
tion of the United States as the instigator of a new imperi-
alism has been reinforced by military threats against Iran, 
North Korea, Syria, and the Islamic State, deployment of 
special forces around the globe, use of "extraordinary rendi-
tion" (the apprehension or kidnapping of suspects followed 
by their transfer to countries known to employ harsh inter-
rogation techniques or torture), and unilateral rejection of 
international environmental treaties and international aid 
agreements. What is less widely discussed in the world's 
newspapers is that this new imperialism is also viewed by 
some academics as the result of a highly competitive global 
economic environment in which the United States is no lon-
ger able to achieve superiority through innovation, product 
design, productivity, and marketing and so has had to resort 
to military intervention.

1. What do you think would be a way of mitigating the negative ef-
fects of both the "Jihad" and "McWorld" worldviews? (Think about 
the role of technology, industry, global income disparity, climate 
change, and environmental resources.)
2. Find a story in a national newspaper that addresses an issue as-
sociated with contemporary globalization. Provide three examples 
from the article that illustrate the increasing interdependence of 
place and region. 
Westernization and Cultural Imperialism
Political scientist Benjamin Barber characterizes the cultural 
tensions associated with contemporary globalization as "Jihad 
versus McWorld." McWorld is shorthand for the pop culture 
and shallow materialism that is part of Western, capitalist 
modernization. Jihad is shorthand for cultural values that are 
underpinned by religious fundamentalism, traditional tribal 
allegiances, and opposition to Western materialism. (Note that 
the term jihad properly refers to a struggle waged as a religious 
duty on behalf of Islam.) Neither "Jihad" nor "McWorld" is 
conducive to a healthy democracy or civil society, argues Bar-
ber, while tensions between the two make for potentially vola-
tile situations.
At the heart of these tensions is a marked disillusion-
ment with the West, especially within traditional Islamic 
societies. Across much of the world, modernization is now 
taken to mean Westernization (Figure 2.17) and, more specifi-
cally, Americanization. Most Americans think of moderniza-
tion as necessary and good but many other people see it as 
the cause of their exploitation. In most peripheral countries, 
only a minority can enjoy Western-style consumerism and 
the impoverished majority is acutely aware of the affluence 
of the core countries. While the gap between rich and poor 
countries has actually been widening for several decades, the 
U.S. aid budget—already low compared to the aid budgets of 
other developed countries—has been declining substantially. 
The United States, as a result, tends to be easily portrayed as a 
swaggering superpower, rigging the world-system to serve its 
own interests and doing relatively little by way of economic or 
humanitarian aid.
The current phase of globalization thus involves a dis-
tinctive new geopolitical element that has been described 
as the "new imperialism": the imperialism of the United

HUMAN GEOGRAPHY   Places and Regions in Global Context
about processes of geographic change and principles of spatial 
organization, we can begin to map out the kinds of geographies 
that the future most probably holds.
Looking back at the way that the geography of the world-
system has unfolded, we can see that a fairly coherent period of 
economic and geopolitical development occurred between the 
outbreak of World War I (in 1914) and the collapse of the Soviet 
Union (in 1989). Some historians refer to this period as the "short 
twentieth century." In this short century, the modern world was 
established, along with its now familiar landscapes and spatial 
structures: from the industrial landscapes of the core to the un-
intended metropolises of the periphery; from the voting blocs of 
the West to the newly independent nation-states of the South.
Today, much of the established familiarity of the mod-
ern world and its geographies seems to be disappearing. We 
have entered a period of transition, triggered by the end of 
the Cold War in 1989 and rendered more complex by the geo-
political and cultural repercussions of the terrorist attacks of 
September 11, 2001, and the global financial "meltdown" of 
2008. Obviously, we cannot simply project our future geogra-
phies from the landscapes and spatial structures of the past. 
At the same time, we can only guess at some aspects of the 
future. But we can draw some conclusions from a combina-
tion of existing structures and budding trends. We have to 
anticipate how the shreds of tradition and the strands of con-
temporary change might be rewoven into new landscapes and 
new spatial structures. Among the relative certainties over 
the next decade or so are the increasing power and influence 
of East and Southeast Asia, with its enormous population

The globalization of the capitalist world-system involves pro-
cesses that have been occurring for at least 500 years. But since 
World War II, world integration and transformation have been 
remarkably accelerated and dramatic. How will the forces of 
broadening global connectivity—and the popular reactions to 
them—change the fates and fortunes of world regions whose 
current coherence owes more to eighteenth- and nineteenth-
century European colonialism than to the forces of integration 
or disintegration in the twenty-first century? Optimistic futur-
ists stress the potential for technological innovations to dis-
cover and harness new resources, to provide faster and more 
effective means of transportation and communication, and to 
make possible new ways of living. Space and place, we are led 
to believe, will be transcended by technological fixes.
Pessimistic futurists stress the finite nature of Earth's re-
sources, the fragility of its environment, and population growth 
rates that exceed the capacity of peripheral regions to sustain 
them. Such doomsday forecasting scenarios include irretriev-
able environmental degradation, increasing social and economic 
polarization, and the breakdown of law and order. The sort of 
geography associated with these scenarios is also rarely explicit, 
but it usually involves the probability of a sharp polarization be-
tween the haves and have-nots at every geographical scale.
Fortunately, we don't have to choose between the two ex-
treme scenarios of optimism and pessimism. Using our geo-
graphical imagination, we can suggest a more grounded outline 
of future geographies. To do so, we must first glance back at the 
past. Then, looking at present trends and using what we know

shift in relative wealth and economic power from the West 
to the East; an increased probability of conflict in the Middle 
East; and an intensification of problems resulting from pres-
sure on food, water, and energy resources. Among the key 
uncertainties are the speed of climate change, the resolution 
of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and the effectiveness of alterna-
tive energy technologies. In subsequent chapters, we exam-
ine these and related issues in detail.

1. What is the middle ground between the optimistic and pessimistic 
futurist perspectives?
2. What are specific examples of some of the "relative certainties": 
the shift of wealth from West to East, rising power of Asia, conflict 
in the Middle East, and pressure on resources? How do these 
global issues directly impact your geography?
Places and regions everywhere carry the legacy of a sequence 
of major changes in world geography. The evolution of world 
geography can be traced from the prehistoric hearths of agricul-
tural development and human settlement, through the trading 
systems of the precapitalist, preindustrial world, to the mod-
ern world. The foundations of the modern world are industri-
alization, colonization, and the international market economy. 
Today, these foundations can be seen in the geography of the 
Information Age, a geography that provides a global context for 
places and regions.
Today's world is highly integrated. Places and regions have 
become increasingly interdependent, linked through complex 
and rapidly changing commodity chains orchestrated by trans-
national corporations. Using new technology systems that al-
low for instantaneous global telecommunications and flexible 
patterns of investment and production, these corporations 
span the world. This integration blurs some national and re-
gional differences as the global marketplace brings about a dis-
persion of people, tastes, and ideas. The overall result, though, 
has been an intensification of differences between the core and 
the periphery. Within this new global context, local differences 
in resource endowments remain and people's territorial im-
pulses endure. Many local cultures continue to be resilient or 
adaptive. Fundamental principles of spatial organization also 
continue to operate.
The emergence of globalization—with its transnational 
architectural styles, dress codes, retail chains, and popular 
culture and ubiquitous immigrants, business visitors, and tour-
ists—seems as if it might inevitably impose a sense of place-
lessness and dislocation, a loss of territorial identity, and an 
erosion of the distinctive sense of place associated with certain 
localities. Yet the common experiences associated with global-
ization are still modified by local geographies. The structures 
and flows of globalization are variously embraced, resisted, 
subverted, and exploited as they make contact with specific 
places and specific communities. In the process, places and re-
gions are reconstructed rather than effaced. Often this involves 
deliberate attempts by the residents of a particular area to cre-
ate or re-create territorial identity and a sense of place. Human 
geographies change, but they don't disappear.
CONCLUSION
LEARNING OUTCOMES REVISITED
■ Summarize the distinctive stages of the evolution of the mod-
ern world-system.
Premodern geographies were organized around minisys-
tems and regional empires. The modern world-system was 
established over a long period that began in the late fif-
teenth century. More and more peoples around the world 
have become exposed to one another's technologies and 
ideas since the fifteenth century. Different resources, social 
structures, and cultural systems resulted in quite different 
pathways of development, however. Some societies were 
incorporated into the new, European-based international 
economic system faster than others; some resisted incor-
poration; and some sought alternative systems of economic 
and political organization.
■ Analyze how and why the new technologies of the Industrial 
Revolution helped bring about the emergence of a global eco-
nomic system.
The new technologies of the Industrial Revolution brought 
about the emergence of a global economic system that 
reached into almost every part of the world and into vir-
tually every aspect of people's lives. New transportation 
technologies triggered successive phases of geographic 
expansion, allowing for an intensive period of external 
colonization and imperialism. The core of the world-sys-
tem (Europe) grew to include the United States and Japan, 
while most of the rest of the world was systematically in-
corporated into the capitalist world-system as a dependent 
periphery.
■ Examine the changing patterns of interdependence among dif-
ferent world regions.
Each place and region carries out its own particular role 
within the competitive world-system. Because of these 
different roles, places and regions are dependent on one 
another. The development of each place affects, and is af-
fected by, the development of many other places. Since 
the seventeenth century, the world-system has been con-
solidated, with stronger economic ties between countries. 
It has also been extended, with all the world's countries 
eventually becoming involved to some extent in the inter-
dependence of the capitalist system and the consequent 
flows of resources, capital, goods, ideas, and people among 
places and regions.

the food supplies for their rapidly growing populations. In 
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the industrial core 
nations embarked on the inland penetration of the world's 
midcontinental grassland zones to exploit them for grain 
or stock production. At the same time, as the demand for 
tropical plantation products increased, most of the tropical 
world came under the political and economic control—di-
rect or indirect—of one or another of the industrial core 
nations. For these peripheral regions, European overseas 
expansion meant political and economic dependency.
■ Identify an example of each of the four key issues caused by 
globalization—environmental, health, core-periphery dispar-
ity, and security issues.
Many of the important issues facing modern society are 
the consequences—intended and unintended—of human 
modifications of our physical environment. In addition, 
the increased intensity of international trade and travel has 
also heightened the risk and speed of the spread of disease. 
Globalization has also intensified differences in prosperity 
between the core and the periphery, and contemporary so-
ciety is characterized by new vulnerabilities and hazards, 
many of them uncontrollable and with a global reach.
■ Compare the three tiers that constitute the modern 
world-system.
Today, the world-system is highly structured and is charac-
terized by three tiers: core regions, semiperipheral regions, 
and peripheral regions. The core regions of the world-system 
are those that dominate trade, control the most advanced 
technologies, and have high levels of productivity within 
diversified economies. Peripheral regions are characterized 
by dependent and disadvantageous trading relationships, by 
primitive or obsolescent technologies, and by undeveloped 
or narrowly specialized economies with low levels of pro-
ductivity. Semiperipheral regions are able to exploit periph-
eral regions but are themselves exploited and dominated by 
the core regions. This three-tiered system is fluid, providing 
a continually changing framework for geographical transfor-
mation within individual places and regions.
■ Explain how the growth and internal development of the 
world's core regions could take place only with the foodstuffs, 
raw materials, and markets provided by the colonization of the 
periphery.
Peripheral regions were originally developed and exploited 
to provide the raw materials for industrializing regions and

 3. Consider the core, the semiperiphery, and the periphery, 
not from the perspective of states, but from the viewpoint of 
transnational corporations. Research two corporations and 
find out where their corporate headquarters are located, de-
velop a list of what they produce, and, if possible, find out 
where their products come from. Take into consideration 
any raw materials and manufacturing that are involved. 
For example, your group might want to consider cell 
phone companies. Where are the companies located? Are 
they in the core, semiperiphery, or periphery? Where do 
they get the material to make cell phones, within the core, 
semiperiphery, or periphery? And finally where are the 
cells phones manufactured? Once you have compiled this 
information, develop a world map displaying your informa-
tion and the ways the transnational corporations' products 
move between the core, semiperiphery, and periphery.
 1. Within your group, discuss the relations of power between 
countries in the core, semiperiphery, and periphery. Con-
sidering culture and knowledge as the new bases of power, 
argue for and against how shifts in bases of power might 
change relations of power between the core, semiper-
iphery, and periphery, and how this may result in global 
tension, conflicts, wars, and even acts of terrorism. (Hint:

CHAPTER 2   The Changing Global Context   89
UNPLUGGED
1. The present-day core regions of the world-system, shown 
in Figure 2.10 (p. 70), are those that dominate trade, con-
trol the most advanced technologies, have high levels of 
productivity within diversified economies, and enjoy rela-
tively high per capita incomes. What statistical evidence 
can you find in your local library to support this charac-
terization? Consider and list what core countries produce. 
(Hint: Look for data in annual compilations of statistics 
published in annual reviews, such as the Encyclopaedia 
Britannica's Yearbook and in the annual reports of orga-
nizations, such as the United Nations Development Pro-
gramme [UNDP], the World Bank, and the World Resources 
Institute, and consider per capita incomes and how they 
differ between countries). How could differences in trade 
be understood from these publications?
2. The idea of an international division of labor is based on 
the observation that different countries tend to specialize 
in the production or manufacture of particular commodi-
ties, goods, or services. In what product or products do 
the following countries specialize: Bolivia, Ghana, Guinea, 
Libya, Namibia, Peru, and Zambia? You will find the data 
you need in a good statistical yearbook, such as the Ency-
clopaedia Britannica's Yearbook, or in a world reference 
atlas or economic atlas. Take one product that you found 
and use in your everyday life and reflect on the process it 
underwent to come into your possession.
 3. Use the Internet to find and map the occurrences of human 
death due to disease outbreaks like Bird flu (e.g. Avian 
influenza H5N1) or Ebola since the year 2000. Then iden-
tify and analyze the reasons for these countries being at 
risk. Suggest measures that can be adopted to make these 
countries more resilient. (Hint: Good sources are the World

DATA ANALYSIS
In this chapter we have looked at globalization, the 
legacy of imperialism, income disparity, commodity 
chains, climate change, risk societies, and other ele-
ments of our globalized world. Terms like "Jihad" 
or "McWorld" construct a world of extremes, but 
are there other alternatives to social, economic, and 
environmental problems created by the global capitalism? Con-
sider the worker-run factories in Argentina that sprang up after 
the collapse of their deregulated, privatized economy. View the 
documentary The Take (2007) (http://www.thetake.org), which 
looks at worker-run factories in Argentina and the alternative 
economies that have developed. Think about these questions 
while viewing:
 1. Why did the Argentine economy collapse in 2001?
 2. How does the worker-run factory system work?
 3. Who began the movement and how do those workers take 
care of their community?
 4. How has the state responded to the worker-run factories? 
What is the role of violence in economic revolutions? 
Think about who has something to lose when these alter-
native economies work.
 5. Research the current state of the Argentinian economy. 
Have the worker-run factories worked? Why or why not?
 6. Finally, what other alternative economies operate suc-
cessfully on the planet? Take a look by conducting an 
Internet search on terms like collective economies, entre-
preneurs in the developing world, women-run businesses 
around the globe, worker rights, and ethical businesses,. 
Do you think alternative economies can destabilize 
global income disparities? Can a different system of 
profit and production increase the quality of life for more 
people?

China, the world's most populous nation, has also been the most  
aggressive when it comes to controlling its size through legislative means. In 
1979, China introduced a policy requiring couples from China's  ethnic Han 
majority to have only one child. The law continues to be in effect, though  
there are exceptions such as would-be parents who are also both single chil-
dren. There are also special benefits for parents who conform to the one-child 
policy. They receive longer maternity leave, for example. The policy was 
meant to stabilize a rapidly growing population beginning in the late 1970s 
and it has been successful in preventing some 250 million births.
And yet, the policy has not been an absolute success. One negative outcome 
of the one-child policy has resulted in an unbalanced sex-ratio as many Chi-
nese parents have exercised a preference for sons—especially after 1986 
when ultrasounds and abortions became more widely available—and chose 
to have sex-selective abortions to ensure that choice (until 1994 when prena-
tal screening was banned). Due in large part to the one-child policy, new tech-
nologies and cultural preferences, the National Bureau of Statistics  reports 
that by 2020, Chinese men between the ages of 20 and 40 will outnumber 
women by 24 million. In a country where there is, at least numerically, a 
huge number of eligible, marriageable age men, heterosexual women would 
seem to be in an enviable position. And yet, many women in their twenties 
and early thirties appear to be rejecting marriage or are at least putting it off 
resulting in what China's State Council calls a "threat to social stability."
In China, young women who are not married by the time they are 27 are shengnu, 
literally "left-over" women. Yet contrary to what the term might suggests, leftover 
women are highly educated, progressive in their thinking and have well-paying 
and interesting professional employment. In theory, such women should be seen 
as highly attractive marriage partners, but many of them report they can't find 

92 
HUMAN GEOGRAPHY   Places and Regions in Global Context
men who are as accomplished as they are and who want to 
support their continued career success. 
The shengnu "problem" is not just a concern for the 
government, however, as parents, academics and busi-
nesses are conceptualizing their failure to marry as 
having the potential to generate significant social and 
economic effects from driving down real estate prices on 
homes to luring married men into affairs. Even  popular 
 culture reflects the concern around shengnu where tele-
vision shows like The Price of Being a Shengnu, Go, 
Go, Shengnu, and Even Shengnu Get Crazy capture a 
 national preoccupation with encouraging smart, success-
ful heterosexual women to find a man. The real problem 
may lie in sexism or, more specifically in men wishing 
to be the dominant partner in a marriage. "This leads 
to a phenomenon in which A-grade men marry B-grade 
women, B-grade men marry C-grade women, and C-grade 
men marry D-grade women. Only A-grade women and 
D-grade men can't find partners," observes Nin Lin, host 
of a popular Shanghai match-making television show. 
It may be that official, social and cultural pressures on 
shengnu are having an effect that will itself have other 
effects: in 2013 by age 35, 90 percent of Chinese women 
were married. And yet, National Health and Family Plan-
ning Commission figures indicate that marriages between 
couples in their thirties are the most "fragile" meaning 
they are more likely than marriages between couples in 
their twenties, forties or otherwise to end in divorce.
Population geographers are interested in situations like 
the shengnu because they illustrate the great variety 
that exists across the world, and even across cities and 
neighborhoods, in the forces that shape birth, death 
and human movement. How do the shengnu in China 
compare to similar 20-something women in the United 
States? Or how do the same women in New York City 
compare to those in rural South Africa where the AIDS 
epidemic is four times more likely to affect women be-
tween the ages of 15 and 24 than men in the same age 
cohort because of poverty, violence against women, cul-
tural factors that promote intergenerational sex, and a 
whole host of other factors? In this chapter, we explore 
these sorts of questions and others at the same time that 
we discuss the tools that demographers— population 
experts including geographers—use to comprehend 
population differences and similarities that exist across 
countries and even across town.
THE DEMOGRAPHER'S TOOLBOX
Demography, the study of the characteristics of human popula-
tions, is an interdisciplinary undertaking. Geographers study 
population to understand the areal distribution of Earth's 
peoples. They are also interested in the reasons for, and the 
consequences of, the distribution of populations from the in-
ternational to the local level. Using many of the same tools and 
methods of analysis as other population experts, geographers 
think of population in terms of the places that populations in-
habit. As well they consider populations in terms of the way 
that places are shaped by populations and in turn shape the 
populations that occupy them.
Censuses and Vital Records
Population experts rely on a wide array of instruments and insti-
tutions to carry out their work. Government entities, schools, and 
hospitals collect information on births, deaths, marriages, migra-
tion, and other aspects of population change (Figure 3.1). The most 
widely known instrument for assessing the state of the population 
is the census, a survey first developed to obtain information for 
tax collection but used increasingly for all sorts of applications 
from predicting election results to shaping economic forces.
The Census A census is a count of the number of people in a 
country, region, or city. Undertaking a census and  establishing 
an accurate count, however, are not simple. Most censuses 
are also directed at gathering other information about people, 
such as previous residences, number of people in a house-
hold, and  income. Many countries comprehensively assess the 
characteristics of their national populations every 10 years. In 
the United States, for example, the Bureau of the Census has 
surveyed the population every 10 years since 1790. The infor-
mation gathered is used to apportion seats in the U.S. House 
of Representatives, as well as to redistribute federal tax funds 
and other revenues to states, counties, and cities.
Vital Records In addition to the census, population experts 
employ other data sources to assess population characteris-
tics. One such source is vital records, which report births, 
deaths, marriages, divorces, and the incidence of certain 
infectious diseases. These data are collected and  recorded 
by city, county, state, and other levels of government.  
▼ Figure 3.1 Gay marriage registration, San Francisco The demise of 
the Defense of Marriage Act in 2013 resulted in the opportunity for gay 
couples to marry legally in 19 states including California.

CHAPTER 3   Geographies of Population and Migration   93
In combination with the census data, vital records help show 
the way the population of an area—whether country, region, 
or city—is changing. Schools, hospitals, police departments, 
prisons, and other public agencies, such as the U.S. Bureau of 
Citizenship & Immigration Services and international groups 
like the World Health Organization, also collect demographic 
statistics that are useful to population experts.
Limitations of the Census
Censuses are extremely expensive and labor-intensive under-
takings for any governmental jurisdiction, and as a result, they 
occur infrequently (Figure 3.2). In many less-developed coun-
tries, governments are not always able to finance a decennial 
census such as the comprehensive surveys undertaken in more 
developed countries like the United States, France, or Japan. 
For example, Cambodia conducted its first complete census in 
1962, another in 1998, and its most recent one in 2008. Liberia 
conducted its first census in 24 years in 2008.
The incompatibility of census dates (caused by the differ-
ent collection dates) makes comparisons between, among, and 
within countries quite difficult. For example, the United States 
conducted its last decennial census on April 1, 2010. China 
conducted a comparable decennial census in November 2010, 
its sixth nationwide census. The difference in collection times 
between the two censuses makes comparisons difficult, espe-
cially because processes such as international migration can 
have a significant impact on the actual numbers.
Despite the massive and costly efforts to count popula-
tion around the world, no census is entirely comprehensive. 
All censuses tend to underrepresent nonmainstream kinds of 
households. For example, it has never been possible in the 
United States to explicitly identify gay households, though re-
searchers used the category of same-sex couple households as 
a proxy for a gay household. The problem has been, of course, 
that lots of individuals of the same sex may share an address, 
many of whom may be heterosexual including unrelated same-
sex roommates, elderly siblings, or divorced friends. The point 
is that while the census is the best approximation of the na-
tional population, it has its limitations.
In the United States, because federal revenue-sharing for-
mulas as well as the apportionment of Congressional seats 
are tied to population numbers, political officials from many 
of America's large and medium-sized cities care deeply about 
the accuracy of population numbers. Undercounted communi-
ties stand to lose significant financial support for local schools, 
roads, and health services, whereas overcounted communities 
can reap more grants than warranted. The census is central to 
the way national goverments operate and its population gets 
access to key governmental services.

POPULATION DISTRIBUTION AND 
COMPOSITION
Because human geographers explore the interrela-
tionships and interdependencies between people 
and places, they are interested in demography. 
Population geographers bring to demography a 
special perspective—the spatial perspective—that 
emphasizes description and explanation of the 
"where" of population distribution, patterns, and 
processes.
For instance, the seemingly simple fact that as of autumn 
2014 the world was inhabited by nearly 7.28 billion people 
is one that geographers like to think about in a more complex 
way. This number is undeniably large and increasing overall 
with each passing second, but its most important aspect for 
geographers is the unevenness of population from region to 
region and from place to place. Equally important are the im-
plications and impacts of these differences. Looking at popu-
lation numbers, geographers ask themselves two questions: 
Where are these populations concentrated, and what are the 
causes and consequences of such a population distribution?
Population Distribution
Many geographic reasons exist for the distribution of popu-
lations throughout the globe. As the world population den-
sity map demonstrates (Figure 3.3), some areas of the world 
are heavily inhabited, others only sparsely. Some areas con-
tain no people whatsoever. Bangladesh and the Netherlands, 
for example, have high population densities throughout. 
Egypt, on the other hand, displays a pattern of especially 
high population concentrations along the coasts and the Nile 
▲ Figure 3.2 Biometric census taking in India, 2011 India became the 
first country in the world to collect photographs and fingerprints of all of 
its population as part of its decennial census exercise. Populations in many 
western countries have refused to participate in a biometric census count 
as they are reluctant to have the government possess such information 
about them.

River but a relatively low population density elsewhere. 
The sparsest inland population densities in the world occur 
across the mountains and rolling plateaus of Mongolia. These 
examples illustrate how environmental and physical factors 
are important influences on population distributions and 
concentrations.
Degree of accessibility, topography, soil fertility, climate 
and weather, water availability and quality, and type and 
availability of other natural resources are some of the factors 
that shape population distribution. Other factors are also cru-
cial—first and foremost are a country's political and economic 
experiences and characteristics. For example, the high popula-
tion concentrations along Brazil's Atlantic coast date back to 
the trade patterns set up during Portuguese colonial control 
in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Another impor-
tant factor is culture as expressed in religion, tradition, or his-
torical  experience. One of the key reasons cities like Medina 
and Mecca in the Middle East, possess relatively large popu-
lation concentrations is because they are Islamic sacred sites. 
 Table 3.1 lists population estimates in terms of continental dis-
tributions. Asia is far and away the most populous continent. 
Running a distant second and third are Africa and Europe.
The population clusters that take shape across the globe 
have a number of physical similarities. Almost all of the 
world's inhabitants live on 10 percent of the land. Most live 
near the edges of landmasses, near the oceans or seas, or along 
rivers with easy access to a navigable waterway. Approximately 
90 percent live north of the equator, where the largest propor-
tion of the total land area (63 percent) is located. Finally, most 
of the world's population lives in temperate, low-lying areas 
with fertile soils.
Population numbers are significant not only on a global 
scale. Population concentrations within countries, regions, 
and even metropolitan areas are also important. For example, 
much of the population of North Africa is distributed along the 
coastal areas where most of the large cities are, as well as along 
the Nile River in Egypt. In Australia, much of the population is 
clustered along the coast (Figure 3.4).
▲ Figure 3.3 World population density, 2013 Maps such as this one are useful in understanding 
the relationships between population distribution and the national contexts within which they occur. 
China and India are the largest countries in the world with respect to population; the core countries 
have much smaller populations.

1. Name three factors that shape population distribution.
2. How is present population distributed in your State or Province? 
Identify the areas of high and low concentration of population and 
list down the factors responsible for this.
Population Density
Another way to explore population is in terms of density, a 
numerical measure of the relationship between the number 
of people and some other unit of interest expressed as a ratio. 
Crude density is probably the most common measurement 
of population density. Crude density, also called arithmetic 
density, is the total number of people divided by the total 
land area. The metropolitan area of Bangkok, Thailand, is a 
very populous Asian city containing over 14.5 million resi-
dents, with a population density of approximately 6,200 per-
sons per square kilometer (about 16,200 persons per square 
mile), which is about 2.5 times the density of Los Angeles 
(Figure 3.5).
The limitation of the crude density ratio—and hence the 
reason for its "crudeness"—is that it is one-dimensional. It tells 
us very little about the variations in the relationship between 
people and land. For that, we need other tools for exploring 
population density, such as nutritional density or agricultural 
density.
■ Nutritional density is the ratio between the total popula-
tion and the amount of land under cultivation in a given 
unit of area.
■ Agricultural density is the ratio between the number of 
agriculturists—people earning their living or subsistence 
from working the land—per unit of farmable land in a spe-
cific area.
■ Health density can be measured as the ratio of the number 
of physicians to the total population (Figure 3.6).
Population Composition
In addition to exploring patterns of distribution and density, 
population geographers also examine population in terms 
of composition—that is, the subgroups that constitute it. Un-
derstanding population composition enables geographers to 
gather important information about population dynamics. For 
example, knowing the composition of a population in terms of 
the total number of males and females, number and proportion 
of senior citizens and children, and number and proportion 
of people active in the workforce provides valuable insights 
into the ways in which the population behaves now and how 
it might behave in the future. The following Spatial Inequal-
ity feature provides a snapshot of population segregation in 
the United States and the effect segregation has on that popula-
tion's life chances.

▲ Figure 3.6 Health care density Another measure of population density is reflected in this map, which shows the num-

and some Central Asian and South American countries have the highest ratio of doctors to overall population. Most of the 
continent of Africa, except South Africa and Egypt, Libya, and Morocco in North Africa, has the lowest ratio, reflecting another 
dimension of core-periphery inequality.

CHAPTER 3   Geographies of Population and Migration   97
As a country, the United States is more racially and ethnically diverse 
than ever before. And in metropolitan areas, statistics indicate that black-
white segregation has been on a slow but steady decline since the 1970s  
(Figure 3.A). Of the largest U.S metro areas, only New York has become 
more segregated (Figure 3.B). But if we look more carefully at black-white 
residential occupation, we can discern a more complicated story about seg-
regation. Using the metro area of Atlanta as an illustration, for example, it's 
clear from Figure 3.C that urban blacks are actually becoming more isolated 
from whites. This is because Latinos and Asians are living in the neighbor-
hoods where whites previously lived and whites have moved even further 
away from blacks. have moved into previously white areas. As such, the resi-
dential distance between blacks and whites has actually increased. The  result 
is actually increased segregation between blacks and whites, which is a prob-
lem because it drives down the economic growth of cities, as witnessed in 
the declared bankruptcy of the city of Detroit in 2013. Important, as well, is 
the fact that urban segregation also affects the wider region within which the 
city is situated.
Why is it that the effects of segregation ripple out from their sources? As 
reported in The Atlantic, it's because segregation affects the life chances of 
minorities and their limited futures mean less growth and prosperity for the 
regions in which they are anchored. How does segregation affect places and 
regions?1 The following is a list of the most clear-cut ways that segregation 
affects economic status.
■ Education: Each year spent in a desegregated school increases 
black students' average annual earnings after graduation by about

Atlantic, August 14, 2-13, p. 29.
5 percent. Schools in segregated neighborhoods are often poorly 
funded due to a limited property tax base, which affects the qual-
ity of teachers who can be recruited and the resources that can be 
invested in the schools.
■ Incarceration: Black students who attend desegregated schools start-
ing in elementary school are 16.9 percent less likely to be in prison by 
the age of 30 as compared with black students who attend segregated 
schools. A poor reading level at the end of the fourth grade is one of 
the best predictors of a future prison term. Underfunded schools in 
low-income minority neighborhoods often produce underprepared 
students.
■ Health: Full black-white residential integration would lower the black 
infant mortality rate by at least two deaths per 1,000 live births. And 
older male adults in racially segregated high-crime neighborhoods 
have a 31 percent higher chance of developing cancer than their coun-
terparts in safer, less segregated areas. Hospitals serving segregated 
black neighborhoods have less technology and fewer medical spe-
cialists than those for a white population of equivalent socioeconomic 
status. As well, black segregated neighborhoods have more fast food 
outlets and fewer supermarkets and recreational facilities.
■ Pollution: Residents of minority neighborhoods experience 5 to 20 
times more exposure to pollution than people who live in predomi-
nantly white neighborhoods. Due to high housing costs and historical 
discrimination, low-income minority neighborhoods are often clus-
tered around industrial sites, truck routes, ports, and other air pollution 
and toxin hotspots.

1. Low standardized test scores on reading level for fourth grade 
children is one of the indicators that private prison investment 
groups use when determining how many prisons to build in a 
region. Explore reading level test data in your local school system, 
which can be found through your state's department of education 
website or through your local school districts' websites. Compare 
a school with low fourth grade reading score to one with high 
scores. Then find data from the U.S. census on the demographics 
of these two areas. Do the data in your locale link poor reading 
scores to low income areas; high scores to high income areas? Is 
there a racial dimension to the data? Why or why not might that 
be the case?
 
2. Using newspaper reports on the Internet, identify incidents of 
protests against local pollution in any city in the United States. From 
carefully reading a sample of articles about the problem, determine 
what the demographic composition of that neighborhood is as well 
as the socioeconomic status of the residents. What are some rea-
sons why pollution sources are located in this neighborhood?

Age-Sex Pyramids
Areal distributions are not the only way that demographers 
portray population distributions. To display variations within 
particular subgroups of a population or with respect to certain 
descriptive aspects, such as births or deaths, demographers also 
use bar graphs displayed both horizontally and vertically. The 
most common way for demographers to graphically represent 
the composition of the population is an age-sex pyramid, which 
is a representation of the population based on its composition 
according to age and sex. An age-sex pyramid is actually a bar 
graph displayed horizontally. Ordinarily, males are portrayed on 
the left side of the vertical axis and females on the right. Age cat-
egories are ordered sequentially from the youngest at the bottom 
of the pyramid to the oldest at the top. By moving up or down 
the pyramid, one can compare the opposing horizontal bars in 
order to assess differences in frequencies for each age group.
Age-sex pyramids allow demographers to identify changes 
in the age and sex composition of populations. For example, an 
age-sex pyramid depicting Germany's 2000 population clearly 
revealed the impact of the two world wars, especially with re-
gard to the loss of large numbers of males of military age and 
the deficit of births during those periods (Figure 3.7). Demogra-
phers call population groups like these cohorts.
Population Cohorts
A cohort is a group of individuals who share a common tempo-
ral demographic experience. A cohort is not necessarily based 
only on age, however. Cohorts may be defined based on criteria 
such as time of marriage or time of graduation.
In addition to revealing the demographic implications 
of war or other significant events, age-sex pyramids can pro-
vide information necessary to assess the potential impacts that 
growing or declining populations might have. The shape of an 
age-sex pyramid varies depending on the proportion of people 
in each age cohort. The pyramid for the peripheral countries, 
shown in Figure 3.8a, reveals that many dependent children, 

CHAPTER 3   Geographies of Population and Migration   99
ages 0 to 14, exist relative to the rest of the population. The 
considerable narrowing of the pyramid toward the top indi-
cates that the population has been growing very rapidly in re-
cent years. The shape of this pyramid is typical of peripheral 
countries with high birthrates and low death rates.
Serious implications are associated with this type 
of pyramid. First, in the absence of high productivity 
and wealth, resources are increasingly stretched to their 
limit to accommodate even elemental schooling, nutri-
tion, and health care for the growing number of children.  
◀ Figure 3.7 Population of Germany, by age and 
sex, 2007 Germany's population profile is that of 
a core country that has passed through the postwar 
baby boom and currently possesses a low birthrate. It 
is also the profile of a country whose population has 
experienced the ravages of two world wars.

Furthermore, when these children reach working age, a large 
number of jobs will have to be created to enable them to sup-
port themselves and their families. Also, as they form their 
own families, the sheer number of women of childbearing 
age will almost guarantee that the population explosion will 
continue. This will be true unless strong measures are taken, 
such as intensive and well-funded birth-control campaigns, 
improved education, and outside opportunities for women, as 
well as modifications of cultural norms that place a high value 
on large family size.
In contrast, the pyramid for the core countries (see Figure 
3.8b) illustrates the typical shape for a country experiencing 
a slow rate of growth. Most countries in the core such as Den-
mark, Spain, and the United States are experiencing birthrates 
that are at or below replacement level. Thus, the pyramid is 
very columnar, hardly a pyramid at all. People are equally 
distributed among the cohorts, though the base is perceptibly 
narrower. In all these countries, however, high levels of pro-
duction and wealth, combined with low birthrates, translate 
into a generally greater capacity to provide not only high levels 
of health, education, and nutrition but also jobs, as those chil-
dren grow up and join the workforce. Visualizing Geography 
3.1 provides some insight into educational trends among young 
people. (Their possible effect on the future of wealth and level 
of production suggest that globalization will continue to be sig-
nificant.) It is important to note that age-sex pyramids can be 
constructed at any level from the national to the neighborhood. 
Figure 3.9 is an age-sex pyramid from Tompkins County, New 
York. Cornell University is located there.
A critical aspect of the population pyramid is the 
 dependency ratio, which is a measure of the economic impact 
of the young and old on the more economically productive 
members of the population. In order to assess this relation of 
dependency in a particular population, demographers divide 
the total population into three age cohorts, sometimes further 
dividing those cohorts by sex. The youth cohort consists of 
those members of the population who are less than 15 years of 
age and generally considered to be too young to be fully active 
in the labor force. The middle cohort consists of those mem-
bers of the population aged 15 to 64, who are considered eco-
nomically active and productive. Finally, the old-age  cohort 
consists of those members of the population aged 65 and 
older, who are considered beyond their economically active 
and productive years. By dividing the population into these 
three groups, it is possible to obtain a measure of the depen-
dence of the young and old upon the economically active and 
the impact of the dependent population upon the independent 
(see Figures 3.8a and 3.8b).
The Effect of Population Cohorts
Countries with populations that contain a high proportion of 
old people face unique challenges. This is a situation most 
core countries will soon be facing as their "baby boom" genera-
tion ages. The baby boom generation includes those individu-
als born between 1946 and 1964. A considerable amount of a 
country's resources and energies will be necessary to meet the 
needs of a large number of people who may no longer be con-
tributing in any significant fashion to the creation of the wealth 
necessary for their maintenance. There might also be a need to 
import workers to supplement the relatively small working-age 
population.
Similarly, knowing the number of women of childbearing 
age in a population, along with other information about their sta-
tus and opportunities, can provide valuable information about 
the future growth potential of that population. For example, pop-
ulations in core countries like Denmark, which has a small num-
ber of women of childbearing age relative to the total population 
size but with high levels of education, socioeconomic security, 
and wide opportunities for work outside the home, will gener-
ally grow very slowly if at all. Peripheral countries like Kenya, 
on the other hand, where a large number of women of childbear-
ing age have low levels of education and socioeconomic security 
and relatively few employment opportunities, will continue to 
experience relatively high rates of population growth, barring 
unforeseen changes. The variety that exists within a country's 
population shapes the opportunities and challenges it must con-
front nationally, regionally, and locally.
Understanding population composition, then, not only 
tells us about the future demographics of regions but is also 
quite useful in the present. For example, businesses use pop-
ulation composition data to make marketing decisions and to 
decide where to locate their operations. For many years, these 
businesses used laborious computer models to help target their 
markets. With the development of geographic information sys-
tems (GIS), however, this process has been greatly simplified. 
Assessing the location and composition of particular popula-
tions is known as geodemographic analysis.

pact of the baby boom cohort, the largest population cohort in

explained by the predominance of young people in this college town.

the "pyramid" becomes a column by the year 2040 as birthrates remain below death rates for each cohort. Note also the significantly higher number of 
women compared with men in the oldest age group for this same year, reflecting the statistical tendency for women to live longer than men.

U.S. demographic history. This series of pyramids illustrates 
how the configuration changes as the boomers age. The nar-
rower column of younger people rising below the boomer 
cohort in these pyramids reveals the biggest problem facing 
this population: a significantly smaller cohort moving into its 
main productive years having to support a growing cohort of 
aging and decreasingly productive boomers. Congressional 
fights over Social Security, the Affordable Care Act, and Medi-
care funding are only the tip of the iceberg with regard to this 
problem.

Study abroad is a phenomenon that is gaining increasing 
popularity in U.S. institutions of higher education.  Whereas 
twenty years ago very few college age students left the U.S. 
to enjoy a period of time in a foreign educational experi-
ence, today nearly 10% of U.S. undergraduates have 
studied abroad before they graduate.

The most popular field of study among U.S. students abroad is social 
science, the least popular is agriculture.
It's important to appreciate that just as U.S. students are 
travelling outside of the country to experience education in 
another place, undergraduate and graduate students from 
other parts of the world are increasingly coming to the 
United States for an educational experience. Nearly half of 
all international students who come to the U.S. to study 
come from just three countries: China, India and South 
Korea.  And in contrast to the international educational 
exposure U.S. students are seeking, foreign students 
coming to the United States are likely to be studying 
business management, engineering and math and 
computer science. These international movements of 
individuals between the ages of 18 and 30 have lots of 
effects that include the culture and politics but most espe-
cially the economy.

POPULATION DYNAMICS 
AND PROCESSES
In order to arrive at an understanding of population growth 
and change, experts look first at two significant factors: fertility 
and mortality. Birth and death rates are important indicators of 
a region's level of development and its place within the world 
economy. To understand population growth overall, however, 
they must also look at the movement of the population. A sim-
ple equation for calculating population growth is G = B − D +  
(I − E), where G (growth) equals B (births) minus D (deaths) 
plus I (immigration) minus E (emigration). We look at each of 
these key population dynamics in turn.
Birth (or Fertility) Rates
The crude birthrate (CBR) is the ratio of the number of live 
births in a single year for every thousand people in the popula-
tion. The crude birthrate is indeed crude, because it measures 
the birthrate in terms of the total population and not with re-
spect to a particular age-specific group or cohort. For example, 
as of 2013, the CBR for the entire population of Canada was 
11. But when we break that large population into subsections 
we find birthrates varying across age groups quite significantly. 
For Canadian women aged 20 to 24 the CBR was 45.7; for 25 to 
29 year olds, it was 95.2; for 30 to 34 year olds, it was 105.9; 
and 35 to 39 year olds, it was 52.3. Clearly, differences exist 
when we look at specific groups and especially at age cohorts 
at their reproductive peak.
Although the level of economic development is a very 
important factor shaping the CBR, other, often equally impor-
tant, influences also affect it. In particular, it may be heavily 
influenced by the demographic structure of the population, 
as graphically suggested by age-sex pyramids. In addition, an 
area's CBR is influenced by women's educational achievement, 
religion, social customs, and diet and health, as well as by 
politics and civil unrest. Most demographers also believe that 
the availability of birth-control methods is critically important 
to a country's or region's birthrate. A world map of the CBR  
(Figure 3.11) shows high levels of fertility in most of the periph-
ery of the world economy and low levels of fertility in the core. 
The highest birthrates occur in Africa, the poorest region in  
the world.
Total Fertility Rate
The crude birthrate is only one indicator of fertility and in 
fact is somewhat limited in its usefulness, revealing very lit-
tle about the potential for future fertility levels. Two other 
indicators formulated by population experts—the total fer-
tility rate and the doubling time—provide more insight into 
the potential of a population. The total fertility rate (TFR) is 
a measure of the average number of children a woman will 
have throughout the years that demographers have identified 
as her childbearing years, approximately ages 15 through 49 
(Table 3.3). Whereas the CBR indicates the total number of 
births per 1,000 people in a given year, the TFR is a more 
predictive measure that attempts to portray what birthrates 
will be among a particular cohort of women over time. A 
population with a TFR of slightly higher than 2 has achieved 
replacement-level fertility. This means that birthrates and 
death rates are approximately balanced and there is stability 
in the population.
Closely related to the TFR is the doubling time of the pop-
ulation. The doubling time, as the name suggests, is a measure 
of how long it will take the population of an area to grow to 
twice its current size. A country whose population increases 
at 1.8 percent per year will have doubled in about 40 years. 
In fact, world population is currently increasing at this rate. 
By contrast, a country whose population is increasing 3.18 
percent annually will double in only 22 years—the doubling 
time for Kenya. Birthrates and the population dynamics we can 
project from them, however, tell us only part of the story of the 
potential of the population for growth. We must also know the 
death (mortality) rates.
Death (or Mortality) Rates
Countering birthrates and shaping overall population numbers 
and composition is the crude death rate (CDR), the ratio of 
the number of deaths in one year to every thousand  people 
in the population. As with crude birthrates, crude death 
rates often roughly reflect levels of economic development—
countries with low birthrates generally have low death rates  
(Figure 3.12).
Although often associated with economic development, CDR 
is also significantly influenced by other factors. A demographic 
structure with more men and elderly people, for example, usually 
means higher death rates. Other important influences on mortal-
ity include health care availability, social class, occupation, and 
even place of residence. Poorer groups in the population have

higher death rates than the middle class. In the United States, 
coal miners have higher death rates than schoolteachers and ur-
ban areas often have higher death rates than rural areas. The dif-
ference between the CBR and CDR is the rate of:
■ natural increase—the surplus of births over deaths  
(Figure 3.13), or
■ natural decrease—the deficit of births relative to deaths.
Infant Mortality and Life Expectancy
Death rates can be measured for sex and age cohorts; one of the 
most common measures is the infant mortality rate. This figure 
reflects the annual number of deaths of infants under 1 year of 
age compared to the total number of live births for that same 
year. The figure is usually expressed as the number of deaths 
during the first year of life per 1,000 live births. The infant mor-
tality rate has been used by researchers as an important indicator 
both of the adequacy of a country's health care system and of the 
general population's access to health care. Global patterns show 
that infant mortality rates are high in the peripheral countries of 
Africa (68) and Asia (35) and low in the more developed coun-
tries of Europe (5) and North America (6) (Figure 3.14). Gener-
ally, the core's low rates reflect adequate maternal nutrition and 
the wider availability of health care resources and personnel.
However, when patterns are examined at the level of coun-
tries, regions, and cities, infant mortality rates are not uniform. 
In the United States, for example, blacks as well as other ethnic 
minorities in urban and rural areas, suffer infant mortality rates 
that are twice as high as the national average. In east central 
Europe, Bulgaria has a 7.8 per-1,000 infant mortality rate, while 
Czechia has a rate of 2.6 per 1,000. In Israel, the infant mortality 
rate per 1,000 is 3.5 and in the neighboring Palestinian territo-
ries, it is 20.
When war or political strife is introduced into the equation, 
the infant mortality rate skyrockets, as the Palestine example

illustrates. More dramatic, however, is that during the height of the 
Iraq war, Iraq had a rate of 84 infant deaths per 1,000 live births. 
Today the rate is 28 with the rate for surrounding countries such 
as Saudi Arabia 16 and Oman 9.  Yemen, a poor country that is also 
experiencing high levels of civil strife has a rate of 72. Global pat-
terns often mask regional, local, and even neighborhood variation 
in mortality rates for both infants and other population cohorts.
Related to infant mortality and the crude death rate is life 
expectancy, the average number of years a newborn infant can 
expect to live. Not surprisingly, life expectancy varies con-
siderably from country to country, region to region, and even 
from place to place within cities and among different classes 
and racial and ethnic groups. In the United States, a child born 
in 2013 can expect to live 79 years. If we begin to specify the 
characteristics of that infant by sex and race, however, varia-
tion emerges. An African American male born in 2013 has a 
life expectancy of 69.5 years, while a white female born that 
same year can expect to live, on average, 81 years.
Another key factor influencing life expectancy is epidem-
ics, which can quickly and radically alter population numbers 
and composition. In our times, epidemics can spread swiftly 
over great distances, largely because people and other disease 
carriers can travel from one place to another rapidly. Epidemics 
can have profound effects, from the international to the local 
level, and reflect the increasing interdependence of a shrinking 
globe. Geographers are particularly interested in understand-
ing the ways that epidemics, disease, and health in general 
may affect different population groups in different ways and 
have a greater or lesser impact on different localities.
Medical and Health Geographies
Medical geography is a subarea of the discipline that special-
izes in understanding the spatial distribution and extent of 
disease and illness as well as health care access and deliv-
ery. This perspective tends to start from the existence of dis-
ease and then uses quantitative approaches, such as disease 
mapping, to understand its spatial distribution and diffusion.  
In contrast, health geography starts with health as an initial 
condition and focuses on the dynamic relationship between 
health, people, and place. For example, health geographers 
consider race, class, ethnicity, and gender and how it affects or 
is affected by place (Figure 3.15). Whereas medical geographers 
 explore the spatial manifestation of disease change—old dis-
eases are returning (tuberculosis), new diseases are emerging 
(Ebola) and other diseases are spreading beyond their previous 
boundaries (dengue fever)—health geographers look to under-
stand how social inequalities, environmental factors, or signifi-
cant transformations in economies such as changing agricultural  
practices—from traditional rice crops to GMO (genetically mod-
ified organism) crops in India—can lead to health inequalities 
for particular populations. Health geographers are also inter-
ested in alternative medicine and what it means to have healthy 
places in which to live (Table 3.4). The Geography Matters  
▲ Figure 3.14 World infant mortality rates, 2013 The geography of poverty underlies the patterns shown in this map 
and allows us to analyze the linkages between population variables and social conditions. Infant mortality rates generally par-
allel crude death rates, with sub-Saharan Africa generally reporting the highest rates. These rates reflect a number of factors, 
including inadequate or completely absent maternal health care as well as poor nutrition for infants.

3.3 Geography Matters
If you ask a health geographer what the greatest threats are to global health 
today, she would have to answer you by starting with, "It depends." That's 
because health is a product of where people live and the health-related 
conditions one finds in those particular places. For example, a late 2013 
UN report provided figures showing that in that year, Mexico surpassed the  
United States as the world's most obese country.1 Obesity is a medical con-
dition in which excess body fat may cause health complications, leading to 
reduced life expectancy (Figure 3.D). The UN report's data were surprising 
because Americans have held the title as the world's most obese population 
for a decade. And, the difference between the two countries is quite small: 
roughly one-third of the adult population in both countries is considered 
obese. Obesity—often found in higher rates among poorer populations—is 
complicated by diabetes and related conditions and leads to hundreds of 
thousands of deaths each year in Mexico and the United States.
But let's look at the flip side of weight-related health issues in the 
world's rich and middle-income countries. When we do, what we learn 
is that while the poorest adult citizens in some of the world's wealthier 
countries are dying from obesity-related diabetes, in low-income coun-
tries, impoverished children and mothers are dying from malnutrition or 
suffering severe long-term ill-health from chronic under-nutrition. Both are 
examples of what experts call the double burden of malnutrition: the case 
of both over and under-nutrition in a national population  (Figure 3.E). 
Remarkably, in both cases and despite being very different diseases, re-
searchers find that inexpensive, good quality, readily available nutritious 
food in adequate quantity can be a powerful intervention 
for recovery and prevention.
These two threats to human health are examples of  
non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Non-infectious 
or not transmissible among people, the four main types of 
NCDs are cardiovascular disease, cancer, respiratory dis-
ease, and diabetes. Combined, these NCDs kill more than 
36 million people each year across the globe. Many of these diseases are 
tied to certain behaviors, including tobacco use, physical inactivity, and un-
healthy diet, as well as the harmful effects of alcohol consumption. However, 
some of these diseases are also tied to one's genetics and family history.
Recognizing that NCDs are now the leading cause of death globally 
should not distract us from communicable diseases, especially the most wor-
rying ones. These are the diseases made increasingly popular in "medical thrill-
ers," including those that jump from non-humans to humans, or are influenzas 
of one sort or another. The Happening (2008), about a plant-based virus, 
Outbreak (1995) based on the Ebola virus, or The Stand (1994) about an in-
fluenza virus, are popular illustrations of communicable diseases. The most re-
cent film in this genre, said by the CDC to be "highly accurate," is Contagion 
(2011) in which a bat-pig virus (MEV-1) is transmitted to an American busi-
nesswoman visiting Hong Kong setting off a global pandemic. These movies 
illustrate how our interconnected world can facilitate the rapid and dramatic 
spread of communicable diseases across vast global spaces. Indeed, the story 
lines in these movies parallel recent international outbreaks, such as Severe 
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which spread through cities, such as  
Singapore in Southeast Asia and Toronto in Canada, at very rapid rates in 2003.
These epidemics—both those portrayed in film and in the real life ex-
perience of SARS or even more recently with the Ebola outbreak in west-
ern Africa—reflect serious concerns about human-non-human disease 
communication and occupy the attention of national agencies, such as the 
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and international

is considerable agreement among health professionals and natural scientists 
that climate change may be in large part responsible for the changing condi-
tions that support the emergence of diseases in new places. Warming climates 
have been linked to the wider spread of dengue fever, malaria, and cholera 
because these diseases—and the mosquitoes that transmit them—depend 
upon higher temperatures to survive. The same is true for the ticks that 
carry Lyme disease—their geographic range, limited by temperature, is ex-
panding globally northward as air temperatures are rising.
One of the most positive responses to the new geographies of disease is 
the concomitant rise in the use of technology to combat disease, from large-
scale geographic surveillance systems to mobile phones, electronic me-
dia, and innovative and inexpensive devices. For example, mobile phones  
delivering medical and public health information supported by mobile 
devices, known as mHealth, support the improvement of health care 
delivery around the globe. These improvements may include recording 
home births in rural Africa for remote monitoring by medical personnel 
(thereby including those new lives into the local health care system) or can 
enable the delivery of nutritional information and weight loss interven-

feature investigates how and why non-communicable diseases 
and communicable diseases are changing across the globe and 
in particular countries and populations.
No discussion of health geographies would be complete 
without recognition of the most widespread and well-known epi-
demic of our times, HIV/AIDS (human immunodeficiency virus/
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). The disease is a serious  
problem in regions ranging from Southeast Asia to sub-Saharan 
Africa and also affects certain populations in many core coun-
tries of Europe as well as the United States. In the United States, 
for example, HIV/AIDS first arose largely among male homosex-
uals and intravenous drug users who shared needles. Geographi-
cally, early concentrations of AIDS occurred in places with high 
concentrations of these two subpopulations. It had perhaps the 
most severe impact in inner-city areas but cropped up in every 
region of the United States, appearing in the male and female 
heterosexual population. The rate for blacks being much greater 
than the rate for whites. African American males continue to 
bear the greatest burden of HIV/AIDS infection.
The pattern of the disease is different, however, in cen-
tral Africa, where it is overwhelmingly associated with het-
erosexual, nondrug users and affects both sexes equally. The 
geographical diffusion of HIV/AIDS in Africa has occurred 
along roads, rivers, and coastlines, all major transportation 
routes  associated with regional marketing systems. The cen-
tral African nations, including Congo (formerly Zaire), Zambia, 
Uganda, Rwanda, and the Central African Republic, have been 
hard-hit. In sub-Saharan Africa, however, an estimated 22.5 
million people are infected with the virus (Figure 3.16). The 
worst impact is in urban areas, though no area has been im-
mune to the disease's spread.
Although no cure yet exists, four decades after the first 
 reported cases of AIDS we do have the technological and medical 
understanding to substantially alter the HIV epidemic at a coun-
try level regardless of the mode of transmission of HIV.

CHAPTER 3   Geographies of Population and Migration   111
Demographic Transition Theory
Many demographers believe that fertility and mortality rates 
are directly tied to the level of economic development of a 
country, region, or place. Pointing to the history of demo-
graphic change in core countries, they contend that many of 
the economic, political, social, and technological transforma-
tions associated with industrialization and urbanization lead 
to a demographic transition.
A demographic transition is a model of population change 
in which high birth and death rates are replaced by low birth 
and death rates. Once a society moves from a preindustrial 
economic base to an industrial one, population growth slows. 
 According to the demographic transition model, the slowing of 
population growth is attributable to improved economic pro-
duction and higher standards of living brought about by better 
health care, education, and sanitation.
As Figure 3.17 illustrates, the high birth and death rates of 
the preindustrial phase (Phase 1) are replaced by the low birth 
and death rates of the industrial phase (Phase 4) only after 
passing through the critical transitional phase of steady birth-
rates and falling death rates (Phase 2) and then more moderate 
rates (Phase 3) of natural increase (increase through birth, not 
migration). This transitional phase of rapid population growth 
is the direct result of early and steep declines in mortality at 
the same time that fertility remains at levels characteristic 
of a place that has not yet been industrialized. Importantly, 
a new phase (Phase 5) appears to be emerging that is shown 
with a question mark on the model. This phase, which we 
are witnessing in a few countries in the developed world, has 
death rates slightly exceeding birth rates, leading to a slow but 
overall decline in population. Countries in this phase include 
Germany and Italy.
The Demographic Trap
Some demographers have observed that many peripheral and 
semiperipheral countries appear to be stalled in the transi-
tional phase—caught in a "demographic trap." Despite a sharp 
decline in mortality rates, most peripheral countries retain rel-
atively high fertility rates. The reason for this lag in declining 
fertility rates relative to mortality rates is that while societies 
have developed new and more effective methods for fighting 
infectious diseases, social attitudes about the desirability of 
large families are only recently changing.
Although the demographic transition model is based on 
actual birth and death statistics, many population geographers 
and other population experts question its applicability to all 
places and all times. Although the model adequately describes 
the history of population change in the core countries of the 
world, it appears less useful for explaining the demographic 
histories of countries and regions in the periphery. Its signifi-
cance has therefore been contested. Among other criticisms 
is that industrialization—which, according to the theory, is 
central to moving from Phase 2 to Phases 3 and 4—is seldom 
domestically generated in the peripheral countries. Instead, 
foreign investment seems to drive peripheral industrialization. 
As a result, the features of demographic change, such as higher

people with HIV/AIDS living in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Compare the cartograms for Africa with those of North America, 
Europe, and China. Campaigns in some African countries, especially in Zimbabwe and Uganda, have helped to stem the  
number of new cases and ultimately the number of deaths.

living standards, witnessed in the core countries, where indus-
trialization was largely a result of internal capital investment, 
have not been as dramatic in many peripheral countries.
Education, Women, and Demographic 
Transformation
One factor that very clearly leads to demographic change is 
the education of women. Demographers have shown that the 
education of women is likely to increase the pace of the tran-
sition from Phase 2 to Phase 3 because of its impact on fertil-
ity and mortality. It has been statistically demonstrated that 
better educated women have fewer and healthier children and 
have better health themselves as compared with women who 
have little or no education. Studies undertaken by population 
geographers and others have found that the first generation 
of mothers with education are effecting a complex process 
in the transformation of the attitudes of whole communities 
with respect to reduced family size. Still, there are significant 
differences among and within regions with respect to fertility 
rates. In general, the data show that in Africa, and parts of 
Asia, literacy rates for girls are low and fertility rates remain 
high; whereas in Latin America and the Caribbean region, 
by contrast, universal literacy and equal education rates for 
men and women have been achieved and fertility rates have 
 declined. In short, education, and in particular the education 
of women, plays a very important role in the demographic 
change (Figure 3.18).

POPULATION MOVEMENT 
AND MIGRATION
In addition to the population dynamics of death and reproduc-
tion, the third critical influence on population is the move-
ment of people from place to place. Individuals may make 
far-reaching international or intraregional moves, or they may 
simply move from one part of a city to another. For the most 
part, mobility and migration reflect the interdependence of the 
world-system. For example, global shifts in industrial invest-
ment result in local adjustments to those shifts as populations 
move or remain in place in response to the creation or disap-
pearance of employment opportunities.
Mobility and Migration
One way to describe such movement is by the term mobility 
which is the ability to move from one place to another, either 
permanently or temporarily. Mobility may be used to describe 
a wide array of human movement, such as a daily commute 
from suburb to city or a move from one side of the globe to the 
other. Mobility is a term that is meant to capture the capacity of 
an individual or a population to move.
The second way to describe population movement is in 
terms of an actual action, not just a capacity to take an action. 
The term used for this movement is migration, a long-dis-
tance move to a new location. Migration involves a permanent 
or temporary change of residence from one neighborhood or 
settlement to another. Moving from a particular location is de-
fined as emigration, also known as out-migration. Moving to a 
particular location is defined as immigration or in-migration. 
For example, a Moroccan who moves to Paris emigrates from 
Morocco and immigrates to France. This type of move, from 
one country to another, is termed international migration. 
Moves may also occur within a particular country or region, in 
which case they are called internal migration. Both permanent 
and temporary changes of residence occur for many reasons

but most often involve a desire for economic betterment or 
an escape from adverse political conditions, such as war or 
oppression.
Documenting and Explaining Migration
Governments are concerned about keeping track of migration 
numbers and rates, as well as the characteristics of the mi-
grant populations, because these factors can have profound 
consequences for political, economic, and cultural conditions 
on national, regional, and local levels. For example, a periph-
eral country that has experienced substantial out-migration 
of highly trained professionals, such as the Philippines or 
Ukraine, may find it difficult to provide needed services such 
as health care. Benefiting from low labor costs are countries 
that have received large numbers of low-skilled in-migrants 
willing to work for extremely low wages, such as the United 
States, Germany, and Israel. These countries may also face con-
siderable social stress in times of economic recession, when 
unemployed citizens begin to blame the immigrants for "steal-
ing" their jobs or receiving welfare benefits.
Demographers have developed several calculations of mi-
gration rates. The in-migration and out-migration rates provide 
the foundation for gross and net migration rates for an area un-
der study. Gross migration refers to the total number of mi-
grants moving into and out of a place, region, or country. Net 
migration refers to the gain or loss in the total population of 
that area as a result of the migration.
Push and Pull Factors and Types of 
Migration
Migration rates, however, provide only a small portion of the 
information needed to understand the dynamics of migration 
and its effects from the local to the national level. In general 
terms, migrants make their decisions to move based on push 
factors and pull factors. Push factors are events and conditions 
that impel an individual to move from a location. They include 
a wide variety of possible motives, from the idiosyncratic, such 
as dissatisfaction with the amenities offered at home, to the 
dramatic, such as war, economic dislocation, or ecological de-
terioration. Pull factors are forces of attraction that influence 
migrants to move to a particular location (Figure 3.19).
Usually the decision to migrate is a combination of both 
push and pull factors, and most migrations are voluntary. In 
voluntary migration an individual chooses to move. Where 
migration occurs against the individual's will, push fac-
tors can produce forced migration. Oftentimes, the decision 
to migrate is a mixed one reflecting both forced and volun-
tary factors. Forced migration (both internal and interna-
tional) remains a critical problem in the contemporary world.

It shows that jobs, family reunion,

These migrants may be fleeing a region or country for many 
reasons, but some of the most common are war, famine (often 
war-induced), life-threatening environmental degradation or 
disaster, or governmental coercion or oppression. And while 
refugees—individuals who cross national boundaries to seek 
safety and asylum—are a significant global problem, internally 
displaced persons (IDPs)—the number of individuals who are 
uprooted within the boundaries of their own country because 
of conflict or human rights abuse—is also growing globally (see 
Window on the World: Internal Displacement).
APPLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE
1. What distinguishes migration from mobility?
2. Using yourself as an example, identify three push and pull factors 
that will shape your decision about where you will live when you 
complete higher education. Do you suspect you will migrate after 
graduation? If so, will you be doing it out of necessity or choice? 
Please provide specific reasons for both the pull and push factors.
International Voluntary Migration
Migration does not always involve force or even a permanent 
change of residence. Voluntary migration can occur for any 
number of reasons, such as high wage differentials between 
places, better experience and job opportunities elsewhere, 
family links abroad, or local underemployment or unemploy-
ment conditions (Figure 3.20). But migrants are not free to sim-
ply travel wherever they wish as significant laws about entry 
and staying govern migration in every country in the world. 
Some countries, such as the United States, have relatively open 
borders, meaning they are more willing than other countries to 
accept migrants, though migrants are regulated through strict 
laws and quota systems. Japan, by contrast, has some of the 
strictest immigration laws in the world. Japan's modern pref-
erence for cultural and geographical isolation can be traced 
back to the seventeenth century. Recently, however, the Japa-
nese government announced plans to introduce an immigra-
tion system that awards visas to skilled foreign professionals. 
The reason for this change in sentiment is the expectation that 
 Japan will need workers to fill the gaps caused by its shrinking 
population.
Labor Migration
Temporary labor migration has long been an indispens-
able part of the world economic order and has at times been 
actively encouraged by governments and companies alike. 
Sending workers abroad is an important economic strategy 
for many peripheral and semiperipheral countries; it lessens 
local unemployment and also enables workers to send sub-
stantial amounts of money to their families at home. This 
arrangement helps supplement the workers' family income 
and supports the dominance of the core in global economic 
activities. Receiving countries which have developed pro-
grams to facilitate the immigration of what have sometimes 
been called guest workers—laborers given temporary visas to 
work for limited periods of time—gain many of the benefits of 
working abroad that they otherwise would not have at home. 
These include a higher salary and possibly better working 
conditions. It also might, however, occur under highly diffi-
cult working conditions such as estrangement of parents from

3.4 Window on the World
While the global humanitarian community has paid close attention to refu-
gee populations for decades, the problem of internally displaced persons 
began to draw international attention only around 20 years ago. Across 
the globe, at the end of 2012—the latest year for which reliable data are 
currently available—there were nearly 30 million internally displaced per-
sons (IDPs)—individuals who were uprooted within their own countries 
because of civil conflict or human rights violations, sometimes by their own 
governments.
War and Conflict
Most IDPs are the victims of internal conflict with their numbers more than 
twice as high as the global refugee population. It is also frequently the case 
that the plight of IDPs is worse than that of the refugees. This is because the 
IDPs' governments are either unable or unwilling to protect them or provide 
the assistance they have a right to expect. It is also the case that the interna-
tional community has not secured the resources needed to help them.
Figure 3.G provides a snapshot of the number of IDPs in and around 
Syria. By early 2013, that number had risen dramatically for some countries, 
like Syria—torn by civil-war—which has been experiencing the displacement 
of 1 family every 60 seconds. IDPs continue to also rise in Colombia, where 
guerrillas and paramilitaries target civilian populations through arbitrary kill-
ings, looting, and destruction of property. Their aim is to depopulate ru-
ral areas for political and economic gains and to control or regain strategic 
territories. Conflict continues to plague the Democratic Republic of Congo

CHAPTER 3   Geographies of Population and Migration   117
Natural disasters, often the result of climate-related events, are an increas-
ing cause of internal displacement. The number of recorded natural disas-
ters has doubled from approximately 200 to over 400 per year over the 
past two decades. By some estimates, the number of people displaced by 
natural disasters is twice that of those forced to flee conflict. Disasters and 
the resulting environmental degradation can be direct causes of displace-
ment, or they may indirectly affect displacement through environmental 
conflicts.
The UN projects that 150 million people will lose their homes and 
 become climate-related IDPs by the year 2050. The state of climate- and 
geophysical-related IDPs in countries across the globe for 2012 is shown 
in Figure 3.H. It is important in recognizing the effects of climate change 
on IDPs that climate change does not necessarily create a new type of IDP, 
rather it increases the frequency and severity of weather events that may 
lead to displacement. 
 
1. What are some causes and locations of internal  
displacement in the world today?
 
2. Why do you think that internal displacement is an 
issue that has only gotten attention in the last 20 
years? How might climate change affect internal 
displacement in the next 50 years?
resulting in further population dislocation due continued violence in the 
eastern, mineral-rich part of the country, despite the end of the war in 2003.
The largest increase in IDPs in 2012 was in the Middle East and North 
 Africa where the after effects of the "Arab Spring"—popular uprisings 
against entrenched government leaders—are still being felt. Sparked by the 
first anti-government protest in the region in Tunisia, other countries there 
followed suit with protests erupting (and in some cases persisting) in Egypt, 
Algeria, Yemen, Jordan, Syria, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain. These pro-
tests often brought government retaliation so that by the end of 2012, there 
were almost six million IDPs in the region, a rise of 20 percent over 2011.
Disaster and Climate-Induced Displacement
While IDPs are most typically driven by state or civil violence from their 
homes, a second force for displacement is climate-related and geographical 
hazards. The Norwegian Refugee Council provides a helpful typology for 
understand the forces driving disaster-induced displacement.2
■ Sudden onset of hazard events, for example, floods and cyclones.
■ Environmental degradation and/or slow onset hazard events, for exam-
ple, drought.
■ Armed (environmental) conflict/violence, for example, conflict over 
shrinking natural resources.

their children left behind in the country of origin as well as 
problems with employers that are not appealable through leg-
islation that only protects citizens, etc. (Figure 3.21). It should 
also be pointed out that labor migration 
is very likely to improve the economic 
conditions of the employer as well as 
the community in which he or she lives.
In the United States, the most con-
troversial form of international voluntary 
migration is of undocumented workers, 
those individuals who arrive in the coun-
try without official entry visas and are 
considered by the government to be in 
the country illegally (Figure 3.22). Most of 
these workers come to the United States 
from Latin America (the largest share 
from Mexico). Other migrants who come 
to the United States with appropriate vi-
sas but then fail to return to their country 
of origin when their visas expire are also 
considered to be undocumented. Since 
the United States was founded, the im-
migration of working-age individuals 
has been crucial to its growth; it has also 
been a periodic source of conflict.
Economic historians have shown that anti-immigrant 
sentiment peaks when times are hard and declines when the 
economy is booming. The slowly recovering condition of the 
U.S. (and global) economy is likely a strong reason why anti-
immigrant feelings have been so widespread in the United 
States of late where it has been particularly difficult for the 
U.S. Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform. Im-
migration is also a conflicted issue worldwide. Despite popular 
opposition and political impasse, migrants, both documented 
and not, continue to arrive in the United States and affect all 
manner of culture, politics, economy, and social life.
Migrants from Latin American—both documented and un-
documented—for example, have been embraced in Baltimore, 
Maryland, which is actively working to boost its local economy 
following the flight of middle class households to the sub-
urbs. In 2011, the mayor of Baltimore launched a program to 
bring 10,000 families back to the city and she sees immigrants 
as key to that program. To facilitate a repopulation of the city, 
she's signed an order prohibiting police and other city work-
ers from asking people about their (federal) immigration sta-
tus. She also publicly and very actively supported a bill—the 
Maryland Dream Act—which passed the state Legislature. That 
bill provides undocumented migrants access to instate tuition 
rates and state financial aid, a very strong incentive for families 
with aspirations for upward mobility to settle in Baltimore and 
other parts of Maryland.
Contrast the welcoming situation for immigrants in Mary-
land with that of Arizona where in April 2010, state law S.B. 
1070, was passed. The law augments federal immigration law 
by requiring certain noncitizens to register with the U.S. gov-
ernment and makes it illegal for a noncitizen to be in Arizona 
if he or she is not carrying the required documents. It also re-
strains state or local government entities from restricting en-
forcement of federal immigration laws and cracks down on 
individuals sheltering, hiring, and transporting undocumented 
workers. In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court nullified three of

the four provisions of the Arizona law because they effectively 
usurped federal policy or interfered with federal enforcement. 
The Court left in place the provision that allowed law enforce-
ment to investigate a person's immigration status.
An increasingly important category of international mi-
grants is transnational migrants, so called because they set up 
homes and/or work in more than one country. Sometimes these 
migrants are low-paid workers, as in the case of many migrants 
from the former Soviet Union who have taken up jobs in the 
unskilled sectors of manufacturing, agriculture, and the service 
economy in Europe. Other transnational migrants occupy the 
higher end of the socioeconomic spectrum, such as the Hong 
Kong Chinese, who have established substantial property and 
business investments and residences in Canada while main-
taining their citizenship status in Hong Kong as well. Trans-
national migrants seek destinations all over the world and it is 
difficult to think of any country where transnational migrants 
have not appeared.
Amenity Migration
While labor migration is the predominant form of international 
migration, other forms of voluntary international migration 
also occur. One form, gaining increasing popularity among the 
baby boom cohort in the United States and Europe is amenity 
migration. This is a form a migration in which the migrant 
seeks not necessarily employment, but cultural, environmen-
tal, or social benefits in a new country or city.
Baby boom amenity migrants from the United States have 
sought out foreign retirement destinations that are welcoming 
and where health care is excellent and living costs are low. 
Costa Rica, Panama, and Mexico, just to name a few, have be-
come attractive destinations for U.S. retirement migrants in 
search of a package of amenities. In Mexico, the most popular 
municipalities for these migrants are Chapala, Mexicali, Los 
Cabos and San Miguel Allende (Figure 3.23). Though this type 
of amenity migration is small and still growing, the effects on 
the migrants as well as the communities in which they live are 
significant. While the migrants bring their retirement dollars 
to these locations and contribute to local economic develop-
ment and job creation, they benefit by having access to private 
rather than public health care, larger houses than in the United 
States, low-cost domestic help, and lower, and sometimes, no 
taxes in the countries to which they migrate.
International Forced Migration
Forced migration is a worldwide phenomenon (Figure 3.24). 
As described above, an example of example of international 
forced migration is Syrians fleeing their country as it erupted 
into civil war (Figure 3.25). Another more historically pro-
longed example is the Lebanese and the Kurds who have also 
been scattered widely throughout the globe because of war and 
civil strife. The 1975-1990 civil war and more recent violence 
in Lebanon have resulted in a particularly large number of emi-
grations. The failure of the Kurds to establish an autonomous 
state in the early twentieth century led to their being split 
among Iran, Iraq, and Turkey, with a small minority in Syria. 
Many Kurds have moved to different parts of the region or left 
it altogether because of military aggression, persecution, and 
the failure of repeated attempts to establish a Kurdish state.
Other prominent examples of international forced migra-
tion include the migration of Jews from Germany and Eastern 
Europe following the First World War and preceding the Sec-
ond World War as well as the deportation of Armenians from 
the Ottoman Empire after the First World War. Figure 3.26 
shows the scattering of Palestinians from their homeland since 
the establishment of the state of 
Israel in 1948. The refugees have 
been fleeing ongoing violence as 
well as discrimination and land 
dispossession.
In other parts of the world, 
though, refugee populations are 
pouring across borders and cre-
ating difficult conditions for na-
tional governments. The wave 
of popular uprisings against de-
cades-old dictatorships that first 
began in Tunisia in early 2011 
has sparked the largest move-
ment of migrants the world has 
seen since the Second World War. 
Many of these refugee populations 
have sought safe passage north to 
Europe (especially Italy, Spain, 
France, Greece, and Turkey) as 
well as south to adjacent counties 
in Africa, south of the Sahel.

home to many U.S. retirement migrants who have flocked to the city because 
of a wide range of amenities including lower health care and living expenses.

CHAPTER 3   Geographies of Population and Migration   121
Internal Voluntary Migration
One way to understand the geographical patterns of migration 
is to think in terms of waves of migration. In the United States, 
for example, three important and overlapping waves of inter-
nal migration over the past two centuries altered the popula-
tion geography. As with a great deal of migration activity, these 
three major migrations were tied to broad-based political, eco-
nomic, and social changes.
First Wave The first internal migration wave began with 
colonization and increased steadily through the twentieth 
century. This wave had two parts. The first was characterized 
by the large movement of people from the settled eastern sea-
board into the interior of the country. This westward expan-
sion, which began spontaneously during the British colonial 
period—in blatant disregard of British restrictions on such 
expansion—became official settlement policy after the Ameri-
can Revolution. The federal government encouraged migration 
over the course of more than a century as part of the country's 
expansionist strategies. The second part consisted of massive 
rural-to-urban migration associated with industrialization, 
especially occurring during the mid-nineteenth to the early 
twentieth centuries. Table 3.5 illustrates how, between 1860 
and 2000, the United States was transformed from a rural to 
an urban society as industrialization created new jobs and as 
increasingly redundant numbers of agricultural workers (along 
with foreign immigrants) moved to urban areas to work in the 
manufacturing sector.
Second Wave The second great migration wave, which 
began early in the 1940s and continued through the 1970s, 
was the massive and very rapid movement of mostly African 
Americans out of the rural South to cities in the 
South, North, and West. Although African Americans 
had formed considerable populations in cities such as 
Chicago and New York before the onset of this wave, 
the mechanization of cotton picking pushed addi-
tional large numbers of black Americans out of the 
rural areas. Tenant cotton picking was a major source 
of livelihood for African Americans in the Deep South 
until mechanization reduced the number of jobs avail-
able. At the same time, pull factors attracted them 
to the large cities. In the early 1940s, large numbers 
of jobs in the defense-oriented manufacturing sec-
tor became available as other urban workers joined 
the war effort. This second wave of migration can be 
seen as part of a wider pattern of rural-to-urban migra-
tion among agricultural workers as industrialization 
spread globally.
Third Wave The third internal U.S. migration wave 
began shortly after Second World War and continues 
into the present. Following the end of the war and di-
rectly related to the impact of governmental defense 
policies and activities on the country's politics and 
economy, the region of the United States lying below 
the thirty-seventh parallel, also known as the Sunbelt, 
emerged as a migration destination. Between 1950 and 1990, 
this region, which includes 15 states and extends from North 
Carolina in the east to southern California in the west and Flor-
ida and Texas to the south, experienced a 97.9 percent increase 
in population. Beginning in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the 
West also began to grow dramatically. At the same time that 
the West and the South were booming, the Midwest and North-
east, known variously as the Snowbelt, Frostbelt, or Rustbelt, 
declined in population.
The most compelling explanation for the large-scale popu-
lation shift characteristic of the third migration wave was the 
pull of economic opportunity. Rather than being invested in 
upgrading the aged and obsolescent urban-industrial areas of 
the Northeast and Midwest, venture capital was invested in 
Sunbelt locations, where cheaper land, lower labor costs, and 
the absence of labor union organizations made the manufac-
turing and service-sector activity more profitable. By the 1990 
census, there was a decrease in the amount of in-migration to 
the Sunbelt, but the geography of the U.S. population at the 
end of the twentieth century was nevertheless almost diametri-
cally opposed to that of 150 years ago.
Internal Forced Migration
One of the best-known forced migrations in the United States 
is the "Trail of Tears," a tragic episode in which nearly the 
entire Cherokee Nation was forced to leave its once treaty-
protected Georgia homelands for Oklahoma. Approximately 
17,000 Cherokees were forced to march across the continent in 
the early 1830s, suffering from drought, food scarcity, bitterly 
cold weather, and sickness along the way. By some estimates at 
least a quarter of the Cherokees died as a result of the removal.
▲ Figure 3.25 Syrian refugees crossing into Turkey The civil war in Syria 
has caused a massive exodus of the population. Many refugees have fled to 
Turkey as well as Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq as well as internally within Syria.

HUMAN GEOGRAPHY   Places and Regions in Global Context
Placed within the national and international context, 
the movement of Native American populations during 
the nineteenth century can be seen as a response to 
larger political and economic forces. At the same time, 
migrating to the United States, and the national econ-
omy was on the threshold of an urban-industrial rev-
olution. The eastern Native American populations 
posed an obstacle to economic expansion, which 
was dependent upon geographic expansion. Growing 
Anglo American prosperity, it was believed, had to 
be secured by taking Indian land.
Today, many native people in Alaska are being 
forced to migrate from their ancestral homes, this 
time because of climate-induced changes. Alaska has 
warmed twice as fast as the global average during the 
past half-century, resulting in sea ice diminishing, sea 
level rising, and the land itself experiencing tempera-
ture increases. These changes have lead to accelerated 
rates of erosion and flooding, which is damaging and 
destroying infrastructure and preventing local people 
from pursuing their traditional livelihoods. While the 
state and federal governments have been spending mil-
lions of dollars to mitigate these problems, in many 
places they are insufficient and community reloca-
tion is the only option available that can protect them 
from accelerating climate change (Figure 3.27).
Other, recent examples of internal 
forced migration are provided by China 
and South Africa. In the late 1960s and 
1970s, as part of the Cultural Revolution, 
the government of China forcibly relo-
cated 10 to 17 million of its citizens to  
rural communes in order to enforce Chi-
nese Communist dogma and to ease pres-
sures arising from high urban unemployment. The policy 
has since been disavowed, but the effects on an entire 
generation of Chinese youth were profound. Another  
example what took place in South Africa between  
1960 and 1980, when apartheid policies forced some 
3.6 million blacks to relocate to government-created 
homelands, resulting in much suffering and strife. Indeed, 
civil war, ethnic conflict, famine, deteriorating economic 
conditions, and political repression have produced an  
extraordinary series of internal forced migrations in sev-
eral sub-Saharan countries as well as elsewhere throughout 
the globe.
These forced migrations, both internal and interna-
tional in scope, become particularly significant in light of 
changing population. Forecasts predict that 80 percent of 
the world population increase in the next decade will take 
place within the poorest countries of the world. Many of 
these countries have some of the highest rates of forced mi-
gration. The combination bodes ill for these countries' pros-
pects for economic and political improvement.

Highlight some of the circumstances under which they migrate.
POPULATION DEBATES AND 
POLICIES
One big question occupies the agenda of population experts 
studying world population trends today: How many people 
can Earth sustain without depleting or critically straining 
its resource base? The relationship between population and 
resources, which lies at the heart of this question, has been 
a point of debate among experts since the early nineteenth 
century.
Population and Resources
The debate about population and resources originated in the 
work of an English clergyman named Thomas Robert Mal-
thus (1766-1834), whose theory of population relative to food 
supply established resources as the critical limiting condi-
tion upon population growth. Importantly, many critics have 
emerged to challenge him.
Malthusian Theory Malthus's theory was published in 
1798 in a famous book called An Essay on the Principle of Pop-
ulation. In this tract, Malthus sets up two important postulates:
■ Food is necessary to the existence of human beings.
■ The passion between the sexes is necessary and constant.
It is important to put the work of Malthus into the historical 
context within which it was written. Revolutionary changes—
prompted in large part by technological innovations— 
had occurred in English agriculture and industry and were

eliminating traditional forms of employment faster than new 
ones could be created. This condition led to a fairly wide-
spread belief among wealthy members of English society that 
a "surplus" of unnecessary workers existed in the population. 
The displaced agriculturists began to be a heavy burden on 
charity, and so-called "Poor Laws" were introduced to regulate 
begging and public behavior.
In his treatise, Malthus insisted that "the power of the 
population is indefinitely greater than the power of the earth 
to produce subsistence." He also believed that if one accepted 
this premise, a natural law would follow; that is, the popu-
lation would inevitably exhaust food supplies. Malthus's re-
sponse to this imbalance was to advocate for the creation of 
laws to limit human reproduction, especially among poor 
people.
Critiques of Malthus Malthus was not without his critics, 
and influential thinkers such as William Godwin, Karl Marx, 
and Friedrich Engels disputed his premises and propositions. 
Godwin argued that "there is no evil under which the human 
species cannot labor, that man is not competent to cure." Marx 
and Engels were in general agreement that technological de-
velopment and an equitable distribution of resources would 
solve what they saw as a fictitious imbalance between people 
and food.
In the mid-twentieth century Ester Boserup, an agricul-
tural expert who championed the role of women in economic 
development, challenged Malthus's pessimistic assumptions 
about the relationship between population and resources. 
In contrast to the Malthusian argument that an insurmount-
able ceiling on food production acted as a natural limit on 
population growth, she countered that agricultural intensity 
rises with population density. She believed that households 
oriented their production to household requirements and not 
to the market and were therefore adopted more productive 
technologies in order to meet their needs. In short, producers 
intensify production in order to maintain an adequate food 
supply. Boserup's ideas on agricultural intensification be-
came prominent among international development agencies 
for several decades in the mid-twentieth century and are still 
applicable today.
Taking a similar though more structural approach to the 
population-resource issue as Boserup did, geographer Da-
vid Harvey has shown that adherence to Malthus's approach 
results in a doomsday conclusion about the limiting effect of 
resources on population growth. But by following Marx's ap-
proach, quite different perspectives on, and solutions to, the 
population- resources issue can be generated. These solutions 
are based on human creativity and socially generated innova-
tion, which  allow people to overcome the limitations of their 
environment.
Neo-Malthusians and Others Today Neo-Malthusians— 
people today who share Malthus's perspective—predict a pop-
ulation doomsday. They believe that growing human popula-
tions the world over, with their potential to exhaust Earth's 
resources, pose the most dangerous threat to the environment. 
Although they acknowledge that the people of the core coun-
tries consume the vast majority of resources, they and oth-
ers argue that only strict demographic controls everywhere 
will solve the problem, even if they require severely coercive 
tactics.
A more moderate approach argues that people's behaviors 
and governmental policies have a much greater impact on the 
condition of the environment and the state of natural resources 
than population size in and of itself. Proponents of this ap-
proach reject casting the population issue as a biological one 
in which an ever-growing population will inevitably create 
ecological catastrophe. They also reject framing it as an eco-
nomic issue in which technological innovation and the sensi-
tivities of the market will regulate population increases before 
a catastrophe can occur. Rather, they see the issue as a politi-
cal one—one that governments have tended to avoid dealing 
with because they lack the will to redistribute wealth or the 
resources to reduce poverty, the latter condition being strongly 
correlated with high fertility.
The question of whether too many people exist for Earth 
to sustain bedeviled population policymakers and political 
leaders for most of the second half of the twentieth century. 
This concern led to the formation of international agencies that 
monitor and often attempt to influence population change. It 
also led to the organizing of a series of international confer-
ences that attempted to establish globally applicable popu-
lation policies. The underlying assumption of much of this 
policymaking, which has continued into the twenty-first 
century, is that countries and regions have a better chance of 
achieving improvement in their level of development if they 
can keep their population from outstripping the supply of re-
sources and jobs.
Population Policies and Programs
Contemporary concerns about population—especially whether 
too many people exist for Earth to sustain—have led to the 
development of international and national policies and pro-
grams. A population policy is an official government strategy 
designed to affect any or all of several objectives, including the 
size, composition, and distribution of population. The imple-
mentation of a population policy takes the form of a popula-
tion program. Whereas a policy identifies goals and objectives, 
a program is an instrument for meeting those goals and objec-
tives. Most of the international population policies of the last 
three decades have attempted to reduce the number of births 
worldwide.
Figure 3.28 provides a graph of the recent history of 
world population growth and a reasonable projection of fu-
ture growth. By the year 2050, the world is projected to con-
tain nearly 9 billion people. In comparison, over the course 
of the entire nineteenth century, fewer than a billion people 
were added to the population. Over the next century, pop-
ulation growth is predicted to occur almost exclusively in 
Africa, Asia, and Latin America, while Europe and North 
America will experience very low, and in some cases zero,

TABLE 3.6 Global Demographic Indicators, 2011
This table illustrates the substantial population pressures emanating from the global periphery, which contained roughly four times the population of the core with a rate of natu-
ral increase also nearly four times as great. While Asian countries possess the largest proportion of the world's population, their rate of natural increase is considered moderate 
and their level of economic development—measured by their GNI PPP—higher than the average overall for the periphery.

population growth. The differing rates of natural increase 
listed in Table 3.6 illustrate this point. At the turn of the 
twentieth century, the core contained 32 countries with zero 
population growth. By contrast, the periphery contained 
39 countries with rates of natural increase of 3.0 or more. 
A sustained rate of natural increase of 3.0 per year means 
a population will double in approximately 24 years, which 
would be the case for.
International Population Policies
Since 1954, the United Nations has sponsored international 
conferences at 10-year intervals to develop population policy 
at the global level. Out of each conference emerged explicit 
population policies aimed at lowering fertility rates in the 
periphery and semiperiphery. Significantly, all the world 
population conferences have recognized that the history, 
social and cultural practices, development level and goals, 

126 
HUMAN GEOGRAPHY   Places and Regions in Global Context
and political structures for countries and even regions within 
countries are highly variable and that one rigid and overarch-
ing policy to limit fertility will not work for all. Whereas 
some programs and approaches will be effective for some 
countries seeking to cut population numbers, they will be 
fruitless for others.
For instance, China's family-planning policy of one 
child per household appears to be effective in driving 
down the birthrate and dampening the country's overall 
population growth. Because so little data are available on 
China, however, it is not clear whether the policy is op-
erating in the same fashion throughout the country. For 
instance, some population experts believe an urban bias 
exists, and while the policy is adhered to in the cities, it is 
disregarded in the countryside. Interestingly, in the wake of 
the May 2008 Sichuan earthquake—with a death toll of ap-
proximately 90,000 including children caught in collapsed 
school buildings—the Chinese government suspended the 
policy. There is increasing discussion throughout China 
that the one-child policy should be abandoned for the en-
tire country as the Chinese become increasingly urbanized 
and the fertility rate is dropping in spite of the policy, not 
because of it.
Family-planning regulations include setting a legal age for 
marriage, offering incentives to couples to have only one child, 
and mandating increasingly severe disincentives for couples 
who have larger families. In India, family-planning policies 
offering free contraceptives and family-planning counseling 
have resulted in lowering the birthrate. Other countries, such 
as Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Cuba, as well as the Indian state 
of Kerala, have lowered their birthrates not through regula-
tion of family size, but by increasing access to social resources 
such as health care and education, particularly for women. 
More equality between men and women inside and outside the 
household is also believed to have a significant impact on re-
ducing fertility.
Today, over 92 percent of all countries support family-
planning programs and contraceptives, either directly through 
government facilities or indirectly through support of nongov-
ernmental activities, such as nonprofit family-planning asso-
ciations. Despite the pervasiveness of government support for 
contraceptive methods, however, some 215 million women 
would like but currently do not have ready access to safe and 
effective modern means of contraception. The reasons why 
supply is not keeping up with demand are complex, but they 
involve several key factors: the increasing cost of providing 
contraception commodities; the cost of providing clinicians, 
facilities, counselors, and education materials; and the un-
certain financial support of international donor organiza-
tions such as the U.S. Agency for International  Development 
(USAID) (the single largest donor of contraceptives globally) 
and the UN Population Fund for family- planning programs in 
poor countries.
Recognizing the central importance of economic devel-
opment to improving the lives of women, men, and children 
throughout the world, international agencies are increas-
ingly turning to sustainable economic development as a way 
of limiting births and ensuring an improved quality of life 
through the reduction of poverty. A host of related interna-
tional conferences have been held to address this theme, the 
most central one being the UN Millennium Summit. The goals, 
listed in Table 3.7, are aimed at reducing poverty by improv-
ing economic development through aid, trade, and debt relief 
and through the enhancement of democratic governance insti-
tutions and careful attention to the impact of development on 
the environment.
The UN Millennium Development Goals
The UN Development Program (UNDP) Millennium Devel-
opment Goals (MDGs) are based on a partnership between 
core and peripheral countries. With respect to governance 
transformations, for instance, UNDP is working with an oil 
company and Amnesty International in Venezuela to provide 
the country's judges with a comprehensive understanding of 
human rights laws, regulations, and issues. With respect to 
the environment, UNDP is working with farmers in Ethio-
pia by supporting the planting and marketing of traditional 
crops and, in the process, strengthening the country's Bio-
diversity Research Institute and encouraging farmers to cre-
ate biodiversity banks, while the crops make their incomes 
more secure.
The goals and targets are based on the UN Millennium 
Declaration, and the UN General Assembly has approved them 
as part of the Secretary General's road map toward implement-
ing the declaration. UNDP worked with other UN departments, 
funds, and programs, the World Bank, the International Mon-
etary Fund, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation 
and Development to identify over 40 quantifiable indicators to 
assess progress.
The eight major MDGs are aimed at enabling peripheral 
countries to achieve core economic standards of wealth and 
prosperity while recognizing that preexisting conditions will 
have to be taken into account to construct a place-specific de-
velopment path. As the goals imply, enabling more sustainable 
economic development worldwide is seen as a way of also 
shaping population growth and the quality of life for popula-
tions in the periphery. It is also a way of opening up new mar-
kets for core products and services and extending the capitalist 
world-system.

In autumn 2014, the world contained about 7.28 
billion people. The population division of the UN 
Department of Social and Economic Affairs proj-
ects that the world's population will continue to 
increase by 1.2 percent annually to mid-century 
when the 2014 average U.S. college freshman 
will be 50 years old. The distribution of this pro-
jected population growth is noteworthy: Over 
the next several decades, population growth is predicted to 
occur overwhelmingly in regions least able to support it. Just 
six countries will account for half the increase in the world's 
population, including Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Ni-
geria, and Pakistan. Meanwhile, Europe and North America are 
expected to experience very low and in some cases zero popu-
lation growth. Collectively, the periphery will grow 58 percent, 
as opposed to 2 percent for the core regions through 2050. The 
periphery will account for 99 percent of the expected incre-
ment in world population in this period.
Nevertheless, it is increasingly clear that human popula-
tion will not continue to grow indefinitely, even in countries 
with already high populations. Demographic transition theory 
has prompted some population analysts to suggest that many 
of the economic, political, social, and technological transfor-
mations associated with continued urbanization and indus-
trialization across the globe will shift the world's population 
from a period of high growth to one of low growth, or even 
population decline. This will be due to falling fertility. Current 
total fertility of 3.11 children per woman will fall to 2.04 by 
mid-century—just below replacement level but still above the 
current rate in core regions.
In addition to the number of people who will populate the 
planet in the coming decades, a second issue is one more ap-
propriately situated at the individual level. How old can each 
of us expect to live and what will be the quality of our lives as 
we age?
Much has been written in the popular press about expected 
improvements in human longevity with attention paid espe-
cially to those adults who are already past the century mark. 
The term, "blue zone"—areas of the world where people live 
measurably longer lives—suggests that there is a geography to 
long life. For those of us who wish to live to 100, 110, even 
120 in the twenty-first century, there is much to be learned from 
"longevity hotspots" and how they can help people live longer 
lives.
Progress on the MDGs
Each year the UN publishes a report outlining progress in 
each of the UN Millennium goals. The report published in 
2013 states that: "... despite the impact of the global economic 
and financial crisis ... several important targets have or will 
be met by 2015, assuming continued commitment by national 
governments, the international community, civil society, and 
the private section."3 While the report is detailed and we are 
only providing the indicators of progress here, it is important 
to point out that sustained efforts are still required to address 
environmental sustainability, maternal and child health, and 
gender-based inequalities as they affect women's opportunities 
to shape their own lives.

must be done to meet our obligations to the youngest 
generation
■ Most maternal deaths are preventable, but progress in this 
area is falling short
■ Access to antiretroviral therapy and knowledge about HIV 
prevention must expand
■ Too many children are still denied their right to primary 
education
■ Gains in sanitation are impressive—but not good enough
■ There is less aid money overall, with the poorest countries 
most adversely affected
■ The poorest children are most likely to be out of school
■ Gender-based inequalities in decision-making power 
persist

CHAPTER 3   Geographies of Population and Migration   129
 CONCLUSION
The geography of population is directly connected to the complex 
forces that drive globalization. And since the fifteenth century, 
the distribution of the world's population has changed dramati-
cally as the capitalist economy has expanded, bringing new and 
different peoples into contact with one another and setting into 
motion additional patterns of national and regional migrations.
When capitalism emerged in Europe in the fifteenth cen-
tury, the world's population was experiencing high birthrates, 
high death rates, and relatively low levels of migration or mo-
bility. Four hundred years later, birth, death, and migration 
rates vary—sometimes quite dramatically—from region to re-
gion, with core countries experiencing low death and birth-
rates and peripheral and semiperipheral countries generally 
experiencing high birthrates and fairly low death rates. Migra-
tion rates vary within and outside the core. These variations 
may be seen as reflections of the level and intensity of politi-
cal, economic, and cultural connectedness between core and 
periphery and are difficult to predict.
The example of once colonized peoples migrating to their for-
mer ruling countries in search of work provides insights into the 
dynamic nature of the world economy. The same can be said of 
U.S. migrants who in the 1970s and 1980s steadily left their homes 
in the Northeast and Midwest to take advantage of the employ-
ment opportunities that were emerging in the Sunbelt: the South-
east, Southwest, and West. Both examples show the important role 
that people play in acting out the dynamics of geographic variety.
LEARNING OUTCOMES REVISITED
■ Describe why populations change, where those changes occur, 
and what the implications of population change are for the 
future of different places around the globe.
Population geographers bring to demography a special 
perspective—the spatial perspective—that emphasizes de-
scription and explanation of the "where" of population 
distribution, patterns, and processes. The distribution of 
population is a result of many factors, such as employment 
opportunities, culture, water supply, climate, and other phys-
ical environment characteristics. Geographers explore these 
patterns of distribution and density, as well as population 
composition in order to comprehend the complex geography 
of populations. Understanding the reasons for and implica-
tions of variation in patterns and composition provides geog-
raphers with insight into population change and the potential 
impacts that growing or declining populations might have.
■ Identify the two most important factors in population dy-
namics, birth and death, and how they shape population 
characteristics.
In order to arrive at a different understanding of popula-
tion growth and change, experts look first at two signifi-
cant factors: fertility and mortality. Birth and death rates 
are simple but central indicators of a place's level of eco-
nomic development. Fertility and mortality rates provide 
key insights into how well a country, region, or city is able 
to provide for its population, especially in terms of in-
come, education, and health care. Population geographers 
consider life expectancy, immigration, and emigration as 
well, which also affect population dynamics.
■ State how geography is a powerful force in the incidence of 
health and disease.
All people, things and events either occupy or happen in a 
particular place. Health and disease are no exception. Medi-
cal and health geographers help us to understand how a 
place can support healthy bodies or how it constitutes the 
condition for disease and poor health. They also provide 
maps and spatial explanations for the state of disease, such as 
HIV/AIDS, and health, such as the power of the "blue zones."
■ Demonstrate how the movement of population is affected by 
both push and pull factors and explain how these factors are 
key to understanding new settlement patterns.
In general terms, migrants make their decisions to move 
based on push factors and pull factors. Remember that 
push factors are events and conditions that impel an in-
dividual to move from a location. Pull factors are forces of 
attraction that influence migrants to move to a particular 
location. Mobility is the capacity to move from one place 
to another, either permanently or temporarily. Migration, 
in contrast, is an actual long-distance move to a new loca-
tion. Permanent and temporary changes of residence can 
occur for a variety of reasons. Striving for economic better-
ment or escaping from adverse political conditions, such 
as war or oppression, are the most frequent causes. Push 
factors can produce forced migration, but it is usually the 
case that the decision to migrate reflects both push and 
pull factors.
■ Describe the challenges of providing for the world's growing 
population with adequate food and safe drinking water, as 
well as a sustainable environment.
A moderate response to the question "How can the global 
economy provide the world's growing population with ad-
equate food and safe drinking water, as well as a sustain-
able environment?" rejects casting the population issue 
as a biological one in which an ever-growing population 
will inevitably create ecological catastrophe. It also rejects 
framing it as an economic issue in which technological 
innovation and the sensitivities of the market will regu-
late population increases before a catastrophe can occur. 
Importantly, the response to this question is more con-
vincingly understood as a political one. Yet governments 
across the globe tend to avoid dealing with the population-
resource problem because they lack the will to redistribute 
wealth or the resources to reduce poverty. This leaves the 
burden on citizens to organize themselves to force govern-
ment to address the problem and change their own behav-
iors to lessen its effects.

REVIEW & DISCUSSION
1. Consider the population concentration in your town or city 
and some of its characteristics. Look up the census and vi-
tal records. Pay particular attention to birthrates. Compare 
1950 with 2010 census data. What changed with respect 
to birthrates? What might be one reason for the change or 
lack of change? Now compare the data with birth data from 
another city or town. Is there a difference? If so, list two 
reasons why there might be a difference. If there is not a 
significant change, why might this be the case?
2. Pick any two major cities within your country and con-
sider them from the perspective of migration. What have 
been the gross migration patterns of people in and out of 
the cities? How has migration changed over the last  
20 years? List three reasons for these migration patterns.
 3. Do an Internet search and find a current example each of 
refugees and internally displaced people. Compare and 
contrast these different categorizations. What similarities 
do these groups share? What are their primary differences? 
Develop a list of two reasons for each situation. Also, con-
sider how refugees and internally displaced people have 
changed the population characteristics of their given place. 
For example, have these factors had an effect on birthrates 
or infant mortality rates? Please be as specific as possible 
in your answer by citing data that support your conclusion.
UNPLUGGED
1. The geographic distribution of population is a result of 
many factors, such as employment opportunities, culture, 
water supply, climate, and other physical environment char-
acteristics. Look at the distribution of population in your 
state or province. Is it evenly distributed, or are the majority 
of people found in only a few cities? List three factors that 
influence where people live in your state or province.
2. Immigration is an important factor contributing to the 
increase in population in most countries. Identify and 
prepare a list of immigrant communities in your country.

DATA ANALYSIS
1. Where in the world is there a "surplus" of men?
 2. What are the literacy rates for women in those same areas?
 3. According to the United Nations, there are 57 million 
more men in the world than women and these numbers are 
concentrated in the lower age groups. What factors create 
these statistics?
 4. Who lives longer—men or women?
 5. How does that difference in longevity. impact the data you 
are finding?
 6. Why do you think these numbers vary around the world?
Finally, do an Internet search to find out how education 
initiatives are working in some of the different countries in 
Africa and Asia. Look at non-governmental organizations like 
Amnesty International, OxFam International,  Human Rights 
Watch and the United Nations office on women, called UN 
Women. Why do you think some education programs work  
better than others?
How critical is the link between women's education and fertil-
ity? In this chapter we have seen that fertility rates are highest 
in Africa and Asia. At the same time, these two  regions have 
had "outstanding gains" in women's education in the last two 
decades, according to the United Nations. Charting demo-
graphic trends, policymakers and scholars have argued that 
when women are more educated, fertility rates drop. Further-
more, women's education creates higher standards of living for 
women, men and children, resulting in healthier populations 
globally. Take a deeper look at this relationship between fertil-
ity and education through the U.N. report,  
The World's Women, 2010 (http://unstats.un.org/unsd/ 
demographic/products/Worldswomen/WW2010pub.htm).
To begin, find Figure 3.7, "Distribution of population by

only on the numbers of refugees but on their age, gender, and 
other variables. Discuss some of the demographic implica-
tions for both countries if the refugee population was not to 
be allowed to return to the sending country. How could this 
affect population policy in both countries?

PEOPLE AND 
NATURE

In late October 2013, the Elsipogtog First Nation in New 
Brunswick, Canada formed a road blockade to stop an energy company 
from conducting shale oil and gas exploration on their land without their 
consent. The blockade was formed by approximately 300 tribal people as 
well as local community members in reaction to the announcement by SWN 
Resources Canada, a subsidiary of the Houston-based Southwestern  Energy 
Company, that they would soon commence shale gas exploration in First 
 Nations' territory.
The response to the blockade was swift and aggressive with over 100 Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police launching a paramilitary assault on the group, 
brandishing rifles and accompanied by attack dogs. Forty participants were 
arrested and the blockade was broken up as SWN reconsidered how to pro-
ceed. Since that initial event, the Elsipogtog have been joined by another 
First Nations' group, the Mi'kmaq, to carry on their objections to proposals 
by SWN to conduct hydraulic fracking on the shale sands that lie below their 
 native lands. The tribes are arguing that SWN is violating treaty rights and 
fear for the effects fracking will have on their land and water as well as the 
people and animals that depend on those resources.
Groups across Canada, the United States, and the world have emerged to pro-
test fracking, fearing that irreparable environmental damage will result from 
this extreme mining process. As of summer 2014, over 420 communities in 
the United States alone have passed measures to prohibit fracking on lands 
near or in their jurisdictions.
Induced hydraulic fracturing or "fracking," is a mining process designed to 
extract previously inaccessible energy resources from subsurface geological 
formulations. In fracking, highly pressurized fluid—usually a combination of 
water, sand, and chemicals—is injected into a wellbore to create small frac-
tures in deep-rock formations. The production of the fractures allows oil and 
gas to escape the location where they are trapped in underground shale for-
mations and rise up the wellbore to the surface and thus become more readily 
available for capture.

Canada, China, South Africa, and Australia, as well 
as parts of North Africa and Europe, it does not come 
without significant costs. Even as popular opposition 
to fracking is growing globally, more and more wells 
are being opened. Yet because fracking also provides 
jobs, resistance to it is complicated by the opportu-
nity for many who might not otherwise have access to 
employment.
In the chapter that follows, we examine the nature-soci-
ety relationship by looking first at different approaches 
to it. We then examine how changing conceptions of 
nature have translated into very different uses of and 
adaptations to it. We conclude the chapter with an 
examination of sustainable development as a way of 
addressing global environmental problems and a dis-
cussion of the new institutional frameworks and activist  
organizations that are emerging to promote sustainability.
NATURE AS A CONCEPT
As discussed briefly in Chapter 2, a simple model of the 
nature-society relation is that nature, through its grand force 
and subtle expressions, limits or shapes society. This model 
is known as environmental determinism. A second model 
posits that society also shapes and controls nature, largely 
through technology and social institutions. This second model, 
explored in this chapter, emphasizes the complexity of nature-
society interactions. In this section, we explore the relation-
ship between people, nature, and technology to understand 
how humans have shaped the natural world and what those 
human impacts mean for Earth's future.
The Earth Summits
Interest in the relationship between nature and society has 
experienced a resurgence as the scope of environmental prob-
lems over the last 50 years has widened to include not only 
those that are locally or regionally contained, but also those 
that have implications for the whole planet. The single most 
dramatic manifestation of this interest occurred in the sum-
mer of 1992, when more than 100 world leaders and 30,000 
other participants attended the second Earth Summit in Rio 
de Janeiro (the first Earth Summit was held in Stockholm in 
1972). The central focus of the 1992 agenda was to ensure a 
sustainable future for Earth by establishing treaties on global 
environmental issues, such as climate change and biodiversity, 
by raising public awareness of the need to integrate environ-
ment and development.
The signatories to the 1992 Earth Summit conventions 
created the Commission on Sustainable Development to 
monitor and report on implementation. Ten years later, Earth 
Summit 2002 (also known as Rio+10) was held in Johannes-
burg, South Africa. Its central aim was to assemble leaders 
Fracking in Canada and the United States is presented 
as an alternative to North American dependence on fos-
sil fuels—particularly oil—found in the Middle East 
and other areas of the globe. Thus fracking represents 
not just a technology meant to support continued eco-
nomic growth, but also a geopolitical strategy to reduce 
dependence on foreign oil and to augment domestic 
supply and demand tensions. Unfortunately, frack-
ing holds the potential to produce extensive and dra-
matic environmental damage that can result in toxic 
landscapes for both humans and animals, including 
poisoned water resources, denuded soil, and radioac-
tive pollution affecting fish, wildlife, and human water 
systems.
An example of these negative environmental effects is 
the 2011 Chesapeake Energy Corporation fracking ac-
cident that blew out a gas well in northeastern Penn-
sylvania. The explosion resulted in fracturing fluid 
escaping from the well and flowing into the Susque-
hanna River and down into the Maryland's Chesapeake 
Bay. The Environmental Protection Agency has identi-
fied more than two dozen highly toxic and hazardous 
chemicals, including methanol, glutaraldehyde, form-
aldehyde, 2-butoxyethanol and hydrochloric acid in 
the fluid that fracking pumps into the earth. In addition 
to the toxic and hazardous chemicals, along with water, 
that are pumped into the wells to create the pressure 
necessary to release oil and gas from the shale reserves, 
fracking waste fluids also contain contaminants picked 
up from deep within Earth, most notably heavy metals, 
volatile organic compounds, salty brine, and radioac-
tive materials.
Besides the environmental damage that can result from 
onsite fracking, disposing of fracking's radioactive 
waste is another aspect of environmental concern. In 
March 2014, a Pennsylvania-based drilling company 
attempted to deposit two roll-off boxes of sludge in a 
landfill in Chartiers, Pennsylvania, but tripped radioac-
tivity alarms. Turned away from the Pennsylvania land-
fill, the company then hauled the radioactive sludge to 
a landfill in Bridgeport, West Virginia, which lacked 
a radiation detector, since state law there does not  
require one. In fact, U.S. states have a diverse spectrum  
of laws regarding radioactive waste suggesting that some 
states are more likely to become depositories for radio-
active fracking waste than others, even states that have 
no active fracking occurring within their jurisdiction.
While fracking is a widely used response to decreas-
ing access to more readily available oil and gas and 
therefore offers a pathway to energy independence, at 
least temporarily, for countries like the United States, 

CHAPTER 4   People and Nature   135
Some very important changes have occurred since the 
first summit in Stockholm 40 years ago. One change has been 
the emergence of international institutions to facilitate and 
monitor environmental improvements. Another has been real 
progress on the global phaseout of leaded gasoline. A third 
has been increasing scientific and popular interest in global 
environmental issues. Perhaps most significant has been the 
proliferation of concern for sustainability, especially as it has 
broadened out from being a conference theme to a set of prac-
tices being taken up by governments, corporations, public 
and private organizations, and individuals. Among these new 
practices and objectives are environmental restoration, green 
urban development, the use of alternative energy technologies 
(such as wind, geothermal, solar, and nuclear energy), sustain-
able tourism, "greening" of the commodity supply chain, sus-
tainable agriculture, promotion of biomass—the total mass of 
organisms in a given area of volume—and biofuels, green real 
estate development, green government practices, the emer-
gence and growth of carbon markets, the transitioning of towns 
toward sustainability, the construction of sustainable build-
ings, and "green" marketing.

development and environmental impacts?

conference. What was the outcome of the conference and who 
attended (developed nations, underdeveloped, specific regions)? 
Did the attending states issue any resolutions to mitigate environ-

from government, business, and NGOs to agree on a range of 
measures toward achieving sustainable development at the 
national, regional, and international levels. At this summit, the 
need to enhance the integration of sustainable development in 
the activities of all relevant United Nations agencies, programs, 
and funds was highlighted.
The Rio+20—a celebration of the initial conference held in 
Rio in 1992—occurred in June 2012 (Figure 4.1). Also known 
as Earth Summit 2012, its goals are to secure renewed politi-
cal commitment to sustainable development, to assess progress 
toward internationally agreed goals on sustainable develop-
ment, and to address new and emerging challenges. Rio+20 
focused on two specific themes: a green economy in the con-
text of poverty eradication and sustainable development, and 
an institutional framework for sustainable development.
Using Agenda 21 as its focal point, the outcome document 
from Earth Summit 1992, Rio+20 sought affirmation for the 
political commitments made at past Earth Summits and set the 
global environmental agenda for the next 20 years. Agenda 21 
was considered a revolutionary document in 1992 in that it not 
only popularized the term sustainable development, but also 
created an agenda that guided the next 20 years of government 
activities and policies toward improving the environment by 
increasing economic development in the world's periphery. 
Sustainable development seeks a balance among economic 
growth, environmental impacts, and social equity.
The main outcome of Rio+20 was a nonbinding document, 
"The Future We Want," in which the heads of state of the 192 
governments attending the conference renewed their political 
commitment to sustainable development. They also declared 
their commitment to the promotion of a sustainable future by 
reaffirming previous action plans like Agenda 21.

Alternative Solutions to Environmental 
Problems
In the past, technology was viewed as the obvious solution to 
most environmental problems, but today's technological prog-
ress seems often to aggravate rather than to solve such prob-
lems (Figure 4.2). As a result, researchers and activists have 
begun to ask different questions and to abandon the assump-
tion that technology is the only solution.
For instance, philosopher and environmental activist 
Vandana Shiva has led a broad-based and increasingly global 
movement advocating changes in agriculture and food produc-
tion practices (Figure 4.3). In 1982, she established the Research 
Foundation for Science, Technology and Ecology, and in 1991, 
she founded Navdanya, a social movement with the goal of 
protecting the diversity and integrity of living resources, espe-
cially promoting the use and preservation of native seeds, 
organic farming, and fair trade.
In India, Navdanya has successfully conserved more 
than 5,000 crop varieties, created awareness of the hazards of 
genetic engineering, and defended people whose food rights 
are under threat from globalization and biopiracy. A contro-
versial practice with many conflicting definitions, biopiracy is 
the commercial exploitation of biological materials, that is liv-
ing matter, including anything from genetic cell lines to plant 
or animal substances, and patenting that material without

CHAPTER 4   People and Nature   137
This definition recognizes tools, applications, and under-
standings equally as critical components of technology. The 
manifestations and impacts of technology can be measured in 
terms of concepts, such as level of industrialization and per 
capita energy consumption.
The definitions provided in this section reflect current 
thinking on the relationship between society and nature. For 
centuries, humankind, in response to the constraints of the 
physical environment, has been as much influenced by pre-
vailing ideas about nature as by its realities. In fact, prevailing 
ideas about nature have changed over time, as evidence from 
literature, art, religion, legal systems, and technological inno-
vations makes abundantly clear.
The Complex Relationship of 
Environmental Impacts, Population,  
and Affluence
Concern about global environmental changes has given 
rise to a recent attempt to conceptualize the relationship 
between society and the environment based on the prem-
ise that individual societal changes can be both subtly and 
dramatically related to environmental changes. A formula 
now widely used for distinguishing the sources of social 
impacts on the environment is I 5 PAT; it relates human 
population pressures on environmental resources to a soci-
ety's level of affluence and access to technology. More spe-
cifically, the formula states that I 5 PAT, where I (impact 
on Earth's resources) is equal to P (population) times A 
(affluence, as measured by per capita income) times T (a 
technology factor). According to this formula, the differ-
ential impact on the environment of two households' food 
consumption in two different places would equal the num-
ber of people per household times the per capita income 
of the household times the type of technology and energy 
used in producing foodstuffs for that household.
Each of the variables in the formula—population, afflu-
ence, and technology—is complex. For example, with regard 
to population numbers, it is generally believed that fewer 
people on the planet will result in fewer direct pressures on 
resources. Some argue, however, that increased world popu-
lation is quite desirable, since more people means more labor 
coupled with more potential for the emergence of innovation 
to solve present and future resource problems. Clearly, there 
is no simple answer to the question of how many people are 
too many.
Affluence also cannot simply be assessed in terms of 
"less is better." Certainly, increasing affluence—a measure of 
per capita consumption multiplied by the number of consum-
ers and the environmental impacts of their technologies—is a 
drain on Earth's resources and a burden on Earth's ability to 
absorb waste. Yet how much affluence is too much is difficult 
to determine. Furthermore, evidence shows that the core coun-
tries, with high levels of affluence, are more effective than the 
poor countries of the periphery at protecting their environ-
ments. Unfortunately, core countries often do so by exporting 
compensating the peoples whose knowledge revealed the value 
of them or on whose territory it was discovered.
Navdanya and other movements like it have influenced 
environmental experts, including a number of geographers, to 
conceptualize nature not as something apart from humans but as 
inseparable from us. These experts believe that nature and ques-
tions about the environment need to be considered in conjunc-
tion with society, which shapes our attitudes toward nature and 
how we identify sources of and solutions to environmental prob-
lems. Such an approach—thinking of nature and society as inter-
active components of a complex system—enables us to ask new 
questions and consider alternatives to our current practices with 
respect to nature. One such practice, is described in Box 4.1, 
"Geography Matters: The Political Ecology of Carbon Offsets."

technology, and governments on the environment.
2. What are some of the ways your community interacts with the 
natural world around your city? List at least three relationships 
that you observe and discuss whether those relationships are sus-

Nature and Society Defined
The central concepts of this chapter—nature and society—have 
very specific meanings. Although we discuss the changing con-
ceptions and understandings of nature in some detail, we hold 
to one basic conception here, that nature is a social creation as 
much as it is the physical universe that includes human beings. 
Therefore, understandings of nature are the product of differ-
ent times and different needs. Nature is not only an object, it is 
a reflection of society in that the philosophies, belief systems, 
and ideologies people produce shape the way we think about 
and use nature. The relationship between nature and society is 
two-way: Society shapes people's understandings and uses of 
nature at the same time that nature shapes society and its many 
manifestations. The amount of shaping by society is dependent 
to a large extent on the state of technology and the constraints 
on its use at any given time.
Society is the sum of the inventions, institutions, and rela-
tionships created and reproduced by human beings across par-
ticular places and times. Society's relationship with nature varies 
from place to place and among different social groups. The rela-
tionship between society and nature is usually mediated through 
technology. Knowledge, implements, arts, skills, and the socio-
cultural context—all are components of technology. If we accept 
that all of these components are relevant to technology, then we 
can provide a definition that has three distinguishable, though 
equally important, aspects. Technology is defined as
■ physical objects or artifacts (e.g., the plow);
■ activities or processes (e.g., steelmaking);
■ knowledge or know-how (e.g., biological engineering).

4.1   Geography Matters
Do you know what your carbon footprint is—and what you can do about 
it? Your carbon footprint depends on where you live, your level of con-
sumption, and the carbon intensity of your activities. Many of your daily 
activities—such as driving, heating and cooling your home, even what you 
eat—produce greenhouse gas emissions. Add all these calculations together, 
and they account for your carbon footprint. Global greenhouse emissions 
are changing the climate, warming the planet, and causing extreme weather 
events such as droughts and storms. You can reduce your personal emissions 
by using less energy in your home, car pooling more often, or flying less 
often—but you can also choose to "offset" them by paying to reduce emis-
sions somewhere else. 
Some companies, individuals, countries, and even music bands are using 
"carbon offsets" to voluntarily compensate for their emissions or to meet ob-
ligations under the Kyoto Protocol climate change treaty (see Figure 4.A). 
Because the atmosphere is globally connected, emission reductions made 
anywhere can contribute to reducing the risk of climate change. Carbon off-
sets represent a type of global trade, allowing you to buy emission reduction 
"offset credits" from projects anywhere in the world that reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions. Projects might improve the efficiency of an existing power plant 
in China or install wind turbines in India. Because forests absorb carbon and 
removing or degrading them releases it, reforestation can be a popular offset 
option. Often implemented in developing countries where deforestation is 
on the rise and the costs of projects tend to be lower, forest offsets are con-
sidered to be low cost solutions to climate change (see Figure 4.B). 
Geographers who study forest carbon offsets have argued that while 
these projects offer a host of opportunities for climate policy and develop-
ment, trading these carbon offset credits has many downsides. One prob-
lem is what geographers have called "the commodification of nature" where 
valued components of the natural environment—carbon, biodiversity, for-
ests, clean water—are measured, priced, sold, and traded using market logic. 
According to geographer Kathleen McAfee, when we commodify nature, 
we reduce diverse ecosystems to their exchangeable components and ab-
stract nature from its broader social and ecological context. This can result 
in the dispossession of some local people of the right to use or profit from 
their land, and the reinforcement of unequal power relations, which may 
marginalize local communities. These issues are evident in the example of a 
carbon forest project in southern Mexico.
Corn, Cattle, and the Carbon Market in  
Southern Mexico
Established in the mid-1990s, Scolel Té (which means "the tree that grows" 
in a Mayan language) is located in the Mexican state of Chiapas. One of the 
earliest examples of forest-based carbon offsets, the project originated in an 
effort to reverse deforestation and generate local sustainable development 
benefits for small landholders, partly by selling carbon offsets to companies 
and individuals abroad. The project involves the participation of small farm-
ers, many of whom are indigenous and engage in semi-subsistence agricul-
ture of corn and beans, coffee production, forest management, and in some 
cases cattle ranching on communally owned land. By protecting forests and 
planting trees the project stores and sequesters carbon as trees mature. 
In return, the farmers are provided with a series of payments generated 
through the carbon market and the sale of offsets (see Figure 4.C). 
The Scolel Té project has mainly targeted subsistence farmers who will 
change their land use at lower costs than the large-scale cattle ranchers whose 
expanding pastures are the leading driver of tropical deforestation in Mexico 
(as in much of Latin America—see Figure 2). Some communities, such as the

indigenous Chol Mayans, are concerned that selling offsets will constrain their 
use of forests for subsistence or traditional social and cultural uses. 
There are ecological concerns associated with the carbon project as 
well. Because carbon payments are low and irregular, many participants in 
the tropical lowlands plant valuable timber species such as mahogany and 
tropical cedar. The expected revenue from timber is a major financial driver 
for participation in the project because carbon producers are allowed to 
cut timber after trees mature, provided they replant following harvesting. 
However, some have argued that the primary focus on carbon sequestration 
with fast-growing trees has produced timber plantations without sufficient 
attention to biodiversity. 
Reducing Emissions from Deforestation  
and Forest Degradation 
The experience of carbon forest projects like Scolel Té provide important 
lessons for a new global initiative to reduce climate change by protecting 
forests called REDD+. REDD+ pays governments and landowners for Reduc-
ing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) in devel-
oping countries and includes conservation, sustainable forest management, 
and the enhancement of carbon stocks (the plus +). While some groups see 
REDD+ as a solution to both climate change and the sustainability of for-
ests, others are opposed to it. Local people and some international activ-
ists are raising concerns about what REDD+ may mean for the rights of local 
people and the biodiversity of ecosystems. Will large areas of land be set 
aside for climate protection? Will the traditional and indigenous owners and 
users have access to them, and will they be paid fairly for the offsets? Should 
timber plantations—which lack biodiversity—be included? These are all im-
portant questions under debate with regards to REDD+.
Case studies of forest carbon projects indicate the need for caution with 
regard to the further commodification of forest carbon. It may be better to 
pursue other non-market strategies to protect forests, reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions, and generate local benefits—such as taxing carbon emissions 
where they are released or funding energy efficiency and renewable en-
ergy technologies for transport and electricity. Whatever approach we take, 
it is clear that effective and immediate action on climate change is urgently 
important.

A technological innovation can create access to an existing 
resource that was otherwise not available for use. In addition, tech-
nology can sometimes be a solution and sometimes a problem. 
Both principles can be seen in the case of fracking that opened this 
chapter. Producing this energy creates hazards at the same time that 
it threatens other important resources such as safe water supply.
It is therefore clear that increases in human numbers, in lev-
els of wealth, and in technological capacity are key components of 
social and economic progress that have had an extremely complex

products to peripheral countries (Figure 4.4). By 
exporting polluting industries and the jobs that go 
with them, however, core countries may also be 
contributing to increased affluence in the receiv-
ing countries. Given what we know about core 
countries, such a rise fosters a set of social values 
that ultimately leads to better protection of the environment in 
a new place. It is difficult to identify just when environmental 
consciousness goes from being a luxury to a necessity. The role 
of affluence in terms of environmental impacts is, in short, like 
population, difficult to assess. 
Not surprisingly, the technology variable is no less com-
plicated. Technologies affect the environment in three ways,

ENVIRONMENTAL ATTITUDES AND 
PHILOSOPHIES IN THE UNITED 
STATES
As we mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, nature is a 
construct that is shaped by social ideas, beliefs, and values. 
As a result, different societies and different cultures have dif-
ferent views of nature. In the contemporary world, views of 
nature are dominated by the Western (also known as Judeo-
Christian) tradition that understands humans to be supe-
rior to nature. In this view, nature is something to be tamed 
or dominated. But other views of nature have emerged that 
depart dramatically from the dominant view. These include 
the environmental philosophies that became popular in the 
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and the more radical 
political views of nature that gained prominence in the late 
twentieth century. Among the latter are approaches based on 
ecotheology— including Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, and 
Judaism—which reject the long-standing West-
ern tradition. Figure 4.5 provides a snapshot of 
changing attitudes in 
the United States 
toward the environ-
ment over nearly three 
decades.
impact on the environment. In the last 100 years, this complexity 
has come to be seen as a triple-barreled threat to the quality of the 
natural world and the availability and quality of environmental 
resources. Before we look more carefully at the specific impacts 
of populations, affluence, and technology on nature, we need to 
look first at how differing social attitudes toward nature shape the 
human behaviors that are a basis for I 5 PAT.
Nature-Society Interactions
The concept of adaptation to the natural environment is part of 
the geographical subfield of cultural ecology most closely asso-
ciated with the work of Carl Sauer and his students.  Cultural 
ecology is the study of how human society has adapted to envi-
ronmental challenges like aridity and steep landscapes through 
technologies such as irrigation and terracing and organizing peo-
ple to construct and maintain these systems. These adaptations 
can be seen clearly in the rice terraces of Southeast Asia or the 
canals and reservoirs of the southwestern United States. More 
recent adaptations include the use of biotechnology and agricul-
tural chemicals to increase agricultural production and the devel-
opment of new pharmaceuticals to cope with diseases. Indeed, 
it has been argued that climate adaptation measures—reducing 
fossil-fuel consumption, adopting more sustainable farming prac-
tices, and recycling—are a form of cultural ecology. We discuss 
these and other such adaptations throughout this chapter.
Before the 1980s, the principles of cultural ecology did not 
include the political dimensions of ecological questions, but since 
then cultural ecologists have moved away from a strict focus on 
particular cultural groups' relationship with the environment, 
placing that relationship within a wider context instead. The 
result is political ecology, the merging of political economy with 
cultural ecology. Political ecology stresses that human-environ-
ment relations can be adequately understood only by relating pat-
terns of resource use to political and economic forces, particularly 
the way that national states and capitalist economic practices can 
lead to, as well as exacerbate, environmental degradation.
Political ecology is understood to have three fundamental 
assumptions:
 1. The costs and benefits associated with environmental 
change are distributed unequally because changes to the 
environment are not themselves homogenous.

a significant alternative to the "humans-over-nature" approach 
that characterized his times. Many people regard him as the 
originator of a U.S. environmental philosophy.
Thoreau was impressed with the power of nature. He 
emphasized the interrelatedness of the natural world, where 
birds depended upon worms, fish depended upon flies, and 
so on along the food chain. Most notably, however, Thoreau 
regarded the natural world as an antidote to the negative effects 
of technology on the landscape and the American character. 
Concord was just 32 km (20 miles) west of Boston and an equal 
distance south of the booming mill towns of Lowell and Law-
rence. Although he spent his life in a more or less rural setting, 
the Industrial Revolution was in full force all around Thoreau, 
and he was keenly aware of its impacts. His research on the 
animals and plants that surrounded Concord was an attempt to 
reconstruct the landscape as it had existed before colonization 
and massive European immigration.
Thoreau's ideas embraced European notions of romanti-
cism, a philosophy that emphasized the interdependence of 
humans and nature. In direct revolt against those who espoused a 
Judeo-Christian understanding of nature, the romantics believed 
that all creatures—human and otherwise—were infused with a 
divine presence that commanded respect and that humans were 
not exceptional in this scheme. Rather, human divinity issued 
from humble participation in the natural community.
A branch of American romanticism known as transcenden-
talism also influenced understandings of nature during the early 
1800s. Transcendentalism was espoused most eloquently by a 
Unitarian minister turned poet and philosopher, Ralph Waldo 
Emerson, a neighbor and contemporary of Thoreau. It encour-
aged people to attempt to rise above nature and the limitations 
of the body to the point where the spirit dominates the flesh and 
a mystical and spiritual life replaces a primitive and savage one.
Thoreau and Emerson are two of the most important influ-
ences on contemporary American ideas about the human-
nature relationship. Another major influence on U.S. environ-
mentalism was George Perkins Marsh, a native Vermonter, who 
in 1864 wrote a treatise entitled Man and Nature, or Physical 
Geography as Modified by Human Action (heavily revised 
and republished in 1874 as The Earth as Modified by Human 
Action). The first work to suggest that human beings are sig-
nificant agents of environmental change, it is considered one 
of the most important advances in geography, ecology, and 
resource management in the nineteenth century. Marsh's ideas 
served as the foundation of the U.S. environmental movement 
in the twentieth century.
Early in the twentieth century, writers like Gifford Pinchot 
and politicians like Theodore Roosevelt drew on the ideas of 
Thoreau, Emerson, and Marsh to advocate the wise use of nat-
ural resources and the conservation of natural environments. 
Their view that nature should be conserved has survived 
to the present. Conservation holds that natural resources 
should be used thoughtfully and that humans should serve 
as stewards, not exploiters, of the natural world. Conserva-
tion implies responsibility to future generations as well as to 
the natural world itself in the utilization of resources. The 
writings of all these individuals eventually helped to inspire 
a wide range of environmental organizations, including the 
Classical Environmental Philosophies
Henry David Thoreau (1817-1862), an American naturalist and 
activist, perhaps best illustrates a view that began to emerge 
in the mid-nineteenth century in the United States—the incor-
poration of North American Indian conceptions of nature into 
approaches to ecology. Thoreau lived and studied the natural 
world around the town of his birth, Concord, Massachusetts. 
He is most famous for his book Walden, which chronicles the 
two years he spent living and observing nature in solitude in a 
house he built at Walden Pond (Figure 4.6). Thoreau represented

center of our present environmental malaise. Because patri-
archy has equated women with nature, it has promoted the 
subordination and exploitation of both. The many varieties 
of ecofeminism range from nature-based spirituality oriented 
toward a goddess to more political approaches that empha-
size resistance and opposition to the dominant models that 
devalue what is not male. Some ecofeminists are also environ-
mental ethicists. Not only a movement of the core, ecofemi-
nism has also been widely  embraced in the periphery, where 
women are primarily responsible for the health and welfare of 
their families in environments that are being rapidly degraded. 
The unifying objective in all of ecofeminism is to dismantle 
the  patriarchal biases in Western culture and replace them 
with a perspective that values social, cultural, and biological 
diversity.
Deep ecology, which shares many points of view with eco-
feminism, is an approach to nature revolving around two key 
components: self-realization and biospherical egalitarianism. 
Self-realization embraces the view that humans must learn 
to recognize they are part of the nonhuman world. As a form 
of egalitarianism, deep ecology insists that Earth, or the bio-
sphere, is the central focus of all life and that all components 
of nature, human and nonhuman, deserve the same respect 
and treatment. Deep ecologists, like environmental ethicists, 
believe that there is no absolute divide between humanity 
and everything else and that a complex and diverse set of rela-
tions constitutes the universe. The belief that all things are 
internally related should enable society to treat the nonhuman 
world with respect and not simply as a source of raw materials 
for human use.
The environmental justice (EJ) movement considers the 
pollution of neighborhoods by, for example, factories and haz-
ardous-waste dumps to be the result of a structured and insti-
tutionalized inequality that is pervasive in both the capitalist 
core and the periphery. EJ activists see their issues as distinct 
from those of middle-class mainstream groups like the Sierra 
Club or even Greenpeace. For environmental justice activists, 
their struggles are uniquely rooted in their economic status. 
Thus, theirs are not quality-of-life issues, such as whether 
any forests will be left for recreation, but sheer economic 
and physical survival. As a result, the questions raised by EJ 
activists involve the distribution of economic and political 
resources. Such questions are not easily resolved in courts of 
law, but speak of more complicated issues such as the nature 
of racism and sexism and of capitalism as a class-based eco-
nomic system. Like ecofeminism, the environmental justice 
movement is not restricted to the core. Indeed, poor people 
throughout the world are concerned that the negative impacts 
of economic development consistently affect them more than 
the rich (Figure 4.8).
Ecotheology calls for a reevaluation of the Western rela-
tionship to nature. The term came into prominence in the late 
twentieth century—mainly in Christian circles, though it has 
since spread across religious boundaries—in association with 
the scientific field of ecology. Within religious circles, there is 
a fear that science may not be capable of inspiring the changes 
in behavior necessary to thwart continuing environmental 
destruction. Ecotheologists also argue that capitalist political 
Environmental Defense Fund, World Watch 
Institute, the Sierra Club and the Nature Conser-
vancy (Figure 4.7).
Those who espouse a more radical approach 
to nature see the conservation approach as too 
passive to be truly effective in protecting the envi-
ronment. Such individuals believe that conserva-
tion leaves intact the political and economic sys-
tem that drives the exploitation of nature. They 
believe that nature is sacred and should be preserved, not used 
at all. This more extreme position, preservation, advocates 
that certain habitats, species, and resources should remain off- 
limits to human use, regardless of whether the use maintains 
or depletes the resource in question.
CONTEMPORARY ENVIRONMENTAL 
PHILOSOPHIES
Environmental ethics is a philosophical perspective that 
prescribes moral principles as guidance for our treatment 
of nature. From this perspective, society has a moral obliga-
tion to treat nature according to the rules of moral behavior 
that exist for human beings. An aspect of environmental eth-
ics that has caused a great deal of controversy is the idea that 
animals, trees, rocks, and other elements of nature have rights 
in the same way that humans do. If the moral system of our 
society insists that humans have the right to a safe and happy 
life, then, it is argued, the same rights should be extended to 
nonhuman nature.
Ecofeminism holds that patriarchy—a system of social 
ideas that values men more highly than women—is at the

GLOBAL CHANGE IN THE 
ANTHROPOCENE
In this section, we build on our understanding of attitudes 
and practices toward nature by considering Nobel prize-win-
ning atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen's characterization 
of our current era. He coined the term anthropocene to sig-
nal the current geological era in Earth's history in which the 
extent of human activities from agriculture to industrializa-
tion to urbanization have had far-reaching effects on Earth's 
ecosystems. An ecosystem is a community of different spe-
cies interacting with each other and with the larger physical 
environment that surrounds it. We begin our discussion with 
European colonial expansion as it introduced new forms of 
agriculture, industry, and accelerated the development of 
cities throughout the globe. We end the section with a dis-
cussion of global climate change as a manifestation of the 
cumulative effects of human resource exploitation of Earth's 
atmosphere today.
European Colonial Expansion
The history of European expansion provides a powerful exam-
ple of how a society possessing new environmental attitudes 
was able to radically transform nature. These new attitudes 
drew upon a newly emerging science and its contribution to 
technological innovation as well as the capitalist political and 
economic system that was being consolidated across Europe. 
This history also provides a helpful foundation for understand-
ing the attitudes and practices that have helped produce some 
of our biggest environmental challenges today.
Initially, European expansion was internal—largely con-
tained within continental boundaries. The most obvious rea-
son for expansion was population increase: from 36 million in 
1000 to over 44 million in 1100, nearly 60 million in 1200, and 
about 80 million by 1300 (Figure 4.9). As population increased, 
more land was brought under cultivation. In addition, more 
forests were cleared for agriculture, more animals were killed 
for food, and more minerals and other resources were exploited 
for a variety of needs. Forests originally covered upward of 
90 percent of Western and Central Europe. At the end of the 
period of internal expansion, however—around 1300—the for-
ested area amounted to only 20 percent.
and economic institutions actively contribute to environmental 
degradation. In their view, it has become necessary, therefore, to 
address the current environmental crisis through belief systems 
that will overcome the inadequacies of humanly created institu-
tions. Ecotheology recognizes the value of other creatures and 
God's intent for the cosmos as the basis for developing ethical 
models that take into account politics, economics, and practical 
issues in the quest for intelligent environmental policies.
All of these contemporary philosophies of nature attest to 
a growing concern over the environmental effects of globaliza-
tion. Acid rain, deforestation, the disappearance of species, 
nuclear accidents, and toxic waste have all been important 
stimuli for newly emerging philosophies about the relation-
ships between society and nature within a globalizing world. 
While none of these philosophies is a panacea, each has an 
important critique to offer. More than anything, however, each 
serves to remind us that environmental crises are not simple, 
and simple solutions will not suffice.

ultimately meant increased wealth and power for a 
new class of people—the merchants—as well as for 
the aristocracy.
Over the centuries, Europe came to control 
increasing areas of the globe. The two examples 
we discuss in the next sections of the chapter illus-
trate how the introduction of the European people, 
ideologies, technologies, plant species, pathogens, 
and animals changed the environments into which 
they were introduced and also the societies they 
encountered.
Disease and Depopulation in the Spanish 
Colonies Historians generally agree that Euro-
pean colonization of the New World was eventu-
ally responsible for the greatest loss of human 
life in history. Historians also agree that the pri-
mary reason for that loss was disease. New World 
populations, isolated for millennia from the Old 
World, possessed immune systems that had never 
encountered some of the most common European 
diseases. Virgin soil epidemics—in which the 
population at risk has no natural immunity or pre-
vious exposure to the disease within the lifetime 
of the oldest member of the group—were common 
in the so-called Columbian Exchange. Though 
in this case mostly one-way, the Columbian Ex-
change was the interaction between the Old World (Europe) 
and the New World (the Americas) initiated by the voyages 
of Columbus. Diseases such as smallpox, measles, chicken 
pox, whooping cough, typhus, typhoid  fever, bubonic plague, 
cholera, scarlet fever, malaria, yellow fever, diphtheria, influ-
enza, and others were unknown in the pre-Columbian New 
World.
Scholars refer to the phenomenon of near genocide of 
native populations as demographic collapse. The ecological 
effect of the population decline caused by the high rates of 
mortality was the transformation of many regions from produc-
tive agricultural land to abandoned land. Many of the Andean 
terraces, for example, were abandoned and dramatic soil ero-
sion ensued. And large expanses of cleared land eventually 
returned to forest in areas such as the Yucatán.
In the fifteenth century, Europe underwent its second 
phase of expansion. This phase was external and not only 
changed the global political map but also launched a period 
of environmental change that continues to this day. European 
external expansion—colonialism—was the response to sev-
eral impulses, ranging from self-interest to altruism. Europe-
ans were fast running out of land, and as we saw in Chapter 2,  
explorers were being dispatched by monarchs to conquer new 
territories, enlarge their empires, and collect tax revenues 
from new subjects. Many of these adventurous individuals 
were also searching for fame and fortune or avoiding religious 
persecution. Behind European external expansion was also 
the Christian impulse to bring new souls into the kingdom 
of God. Other forces behind European colonialism included 
the need to expand the emerging system of trade, which 
◀ Figure 4.9 Population growth in Europe This graph 
shows growth and change in the European population from 
400 b.c. to a.d. 2050. The growth in the European population 
has been especially dramatic in the last 500 years as a result of 
capitalist globalization. The increase in human numbers at the 
beginning of the 1500s gave an important push to exploration 
and colonization beyond the confines of Europe. The dip in 
the graph from 1300 to 1500 is partially explained by the  
bubonic plague epidemic and food shortages. The dip around 
the mid-twentieth century shows the effect of the two world 
wars. European population is expected to continue to decline 
over the next four decades. (Updated from C. McEvedy and

potatoes, tobacco, cocoa, tomatoes, and cotton were all brought 
back to Europe; so was syphilis, which spread rapidly through-
out the European population.
Importantly, contacts between Europe and the rest of the 
world, though frequently violent and exploitative, were not 
uniformly disastrous. There are certainly examples of contacts 
that were mutually beneficial. The largely favorable ones were 
mostly knowledge-based or nutritional. Columbus's voyages 
(Figure 4.11) added dramatically to global knowledge, expand-
ing understanding of geography, botany, zoology, and other 
rapidly growing sciences.
The encounter also had significant nutritional impacts for 
both sides by bringing new plants to each. European coloniza-
tion, although responsible for the extermination of hundreds 
of plant and animal species, was also responsible for increas-
ing the types and amounts of foods available worldwide. It is 
estimated that the Columbian Exchange may have tripled the 
number of cultivable food plants in the New World. It cer-
tainly enabled new types of food to grow in abundance where 
they had never grown before, and it introduced animals as an 
important source of dietary protein. The advantages of having 
a large variety of food plants are myriad. For instance, if one 
crop fails, another more than likely will succeed because not 
all plants are subject to failure from the same set of environ-
mental conditions.
Before the Columbian Exchange, the only important 
sources of animal energy in the New World were the llama and 
the dog. The introduction of the horse, the ox, and the donkey 
Old World Plants and Animals in the New World A 
second case study of the environmental effects of European 
colonization involves the introduction of Old World plants 
and animals into the New World, and vice versa. The introduc-
tion of exotic plants and animals into new ecosystems is called 
 ecological imperialism, a term now widely used by geographers, 
ecologists, and other scholars of the environment. The interac-
tion between the Old and the New Worlds resulted in both the 
intentional and unintentional introduction of new crops and 
animals on both sides of the Atlantic (Figure 4.10). Europeans 
brought from their homelands many plants and animals that  
were exotics, that is, unknown to American ecosystems. For 
example, the Spanish introduced wheat and sugarcane, as 
well as horses, cattle, and pigs. These introductions altered 
the environment, particularly as the emphasis on select spe-
cies led to a reduction in the variety of plants and animals 
that constituted local ecosystems. Inadvertent introductions 
of hardy exotic species included rats, weeds such as the dan-
delion and thistle, and birds such as starlings, which crowded 
out the less hardy indigenous species. As with the human 
population, the indigenous populations of plants, birds, and 
animals had few defenses against European plant and animal 
diseases and were sometimes seriously reduced or made ex-
tinct through contact.
Contact between the Old and the New Worlds was, how-
ever, an exchange—a two-way process—and New World crops 
and animals as well as pathogens were likewise introduced 
into the Old World, sometimes with devastating effects. Corn,

▲ Figure 4.10 The Columbian Exchange The encounter between the Old World and the New World that followed from Columbus's voyages enabled 
 significant interactions between social and environmental systems. Most beneficial was the exchange of crops that improved nutrition on both sides of the 
 Atlantic; most destructive was the carrying of diseases from Europe to the Americas causing massive loss of life in the New World.

caricature. In New England, for example, prior to European 
contact, some groups hunted for wild game and gathered wild 
foods. More sedentary types, living in permanent and semi-
permanent villages, cleared and planted small areas of land. 
Hunter-gatherers were mobile, moving with the seasons to ob-
tain fish, migrating birds, deer, wild berries, and plants. Agri-
culturalists planted corn, squash, beans, and tobacco and used 
a wide range of other natural resources. The economy was a 
fairly simple one based on personal use or on barter (e.g., trad-
ing corn for fish). The idea of a surplus was foreign: People 
cultivated or exploited only as much land and resources as 
they needed to survive. Land and resources were shared, with-
out concepts such as private property or land ownership. Fire 
was used to clear land for planting as well as for hunting. Al-
though vegetation change did occur, it was minimal and not 
irreversible.
Native peoples of South and Central America altered their 
environment as well, though perhaps in more dramatic ways. 
The Aztecs of Mexico and the Incas of Peru had developed 
complex urban civilizations—many of them more sophisticated 
and highly populated than any European city—dependent on 
created a virtual power revolution in the New World. These 
animals also provided fibers and, after death or slaughter, 
hides and bones to make various tools, utensils, and coverings. 
Most significant in its environmental impact, however, was the 
ox. Land that had escaped cultivation because the indigenous 
digging sticks and tools were unable to penetrate the heavy soil 
and matted root surface became workable with an ox-drawn 
plow. The result was that the indigenous form of intensive agri-
cultural production (small area, many laborers) was replaced 
by extensive production (large area, fewer laborers). This trans-
formation was not entirely without negative impacts, such as 
soil destabilization and erosion.
Indigenous People and their Pre-Columbian 
Environments When discussing the impact of exchange, it 
is important to acknowledge native New World peoples and 
their relationships with the environment. The popular image 
of indigenous peoples living in harmony with nature, having 
only a minimal effect on their environment, is flawed. In re-
ality, different groups had different impacts, and it is errone-
ous to conflate the thousands of groups into one romanticized

has resulted in erosion of the soil needed for subsequent agri-
cultural production, and the use of toxic agricultural chemicals 
has caused the contamination of rivers and lakes.
The Industrial Revolution produced a dramatic growth in 
the emissions of waste material to land, water, and the atmo-
sphere and resulted in serious air pollution and health prob-
lems in many areas. These emissions and the associated pol-
lution persist to this day. Figure 4.13 provides a snapshot of 
how the last 200 years of burning fossil fuels for heat, light, 
movement, and improvement of daily life has conveyed carbon 
dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. We talk at length about 
these effects in the next major section of the chapter; here 
we wish to focus specifically on human-induced (also called 
anthropogenic) change on Earth's atmosphere by examining 
the complexities of climate change.
What Is Climate Change?
Climate change is defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC) as "a change in the state of the climate 
that can be identified (e.g., using statistical tests) by changes 
in the mean and/or the variability of its properties, and that 
persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer. It 
refers to any change in climate over time, whether due to natu-
ral variability or as a result of human activity."
Scientists are largely in agreement that global and regional 
climates have varied over geological time, largely due to slight 
changes in the tilt of Earth's axis in its orbit around the sun 
or associated changes in the amount of solar radiation reach-
ing Earth. They also recognize that climate has changed over 
time because of large-scale events such as volcanic eruptions. 
The kind of climate change Earth is currently experiencing, 
however, is largely due to human activity that is altering the 
composition of the atmosphere. Of greatest concern is global 
warming, an increase in world temperatures and change in cli-
mate associated with increasing levels of carbon dioxide (CO2), 
methane and other trace gases (Figure 4.14). These so-called 
dense populations and employing intensive agricultural tech-
niques on the urban outskirts (Figure 4.12). These groups were 
responsible for environmental modifications through cultiva-
tion techniques that included the irrigation of dry regions and 
the terracing of steep slopes. Irrigation over several centuries 
results in the salinization of soils. In the lowland tropics, 
intensive agricultural practices resulted in widespread defor-
estation as people cut and set fire to patches of forest, planted 
crops, and then moved on when soil fertility declined. Unlike 
in North America, a surplus was key to the operations of both 
societies, as tribute by ordinary people to the political and reli-
gious elite was required in the form of food, animals, labor, or 
precious metals. The construction of the sizable Inca and Aztec 
empires required the production of large amounts of building 
materials in the form of wood and mortar. Concentrated pop-
ulations and the demands of urbanization meant that wide-
spread environmental degradation existed prior to European 
contact.

Global Climate Change
In the 400 years since the Columbian Exchange occurred, Earth 
has been dramatically transformed through human adaptation 
to the environment as well as exploitation of its resources. In 
some cases, the human use of nature has resulted in degrada-
tion or pollution. For example, overcultivation of steep slopes 
▶ Figure 4.12 Tenochtitlán, circa 
1500 This famous contemporary 
painting by Luis Covarrubias of the 
capital city of the Aztecs, Tenochtitlán, 
illustrates the existence of dense social, 
cultural, and political activity in the core 
of the city with agricultural fields on 
the periphery, particularly to the north. 
Agricultural goods were also imported 
from the area surrounding the capital 
beyond the shores of the lake. With a 
population of 200,000, it was roughly 
twice the size of Seville, then Spain's 
largest city. When Cortés came upon 
the capital he noted that "... in Spain 
there is nothing to compare with it."

CHAPTER 4   People and Nature   149
How Do We Know Climate  
Is Changing?
It's important to appreciate that climate change is not an asser-
tion based on a speculative theory or a political agenda. The 
evidence for it is based on facts, many of which are identified 
next.
■ Temperature increase is widespread over the globe and is 
greater at higher northern latitudes. In the past 100 years, 
average Arctic temperatures have increased at almost twice 
the global average rate.
■ Global average sea level rose at an average rate of 1.8 (1.3 to 
2.3) mm per year over 1961 to 2003 and at an average rate 
of about 3.1 (2.4 to 3.8) mm per year from 1993 to 2003.
■ Satellite data since 1978 show that annual average Arctic 
sea ice extent has shrunk by 2.7 (2.1 to 3.3) percent per 
decade, with larger decreases in summer of 7.4 (5.0 to 9.8) 
percent per decade. Mountain glaciers and snow cover 
have declined on average in both hemispheres.
■ Since 1900, precipitation has increased significantly in 
eastern parts of North and South America, northern Eu-
rope, and northern and central Asia, whereas precipitation 
declined in the Sahel, the Mediterranean, southern Africa, 
and parts of southern Asia. Globally, the area affected by 
drought has likely increased since the 1970s.
■ Average Northern Hemisphere temperatures during the 
second half of the twentieth century were very likely 
higher than during any other 50-year period in the last 500 
years and likely the highest in at least the past 1,300 years.
What Are Some Projected Impacts  
of These Changes?
The effects of climate change are not only expected to happen 
in the future, many of them are already occurring.
■ Based on a range of models, it is likely that future tropi-
cal cyclones (typhoons and hurricanes) will become more 
intense, with larger peak wind speeds and more heavy 
precipitation associated with ongoing increases of tropical 
sea-surface temperatures.
■ Crop productivity is projected to increase slightly at mid- 
to high latitudes for local mean temperature increases of 
up to 1° to 3°C, depending on the crop, and then decrease 
beyond that in some regions. At lower latitudes, especially 
in seasonally dry and tropical regions, crop productivity 
is projected to decrease for even small local temperature 
increases (1° to 2°C), which would increase the risk of 
hunger.
■ Coasts are projected to be exposed to increasing risks, in-
cluding coastal erosion, due to climate change and sea 
level rise. A rising sea level would be disastrous for some 
countries. About 70 percent of Bangladesh, for example, is 
at sea level, as is much of Egypt's most fertile land in the 
Nile delta (Figure 4.15).

resulting in its warming as well as that of Earth's surface.

▶ Figure 4.16 Deforestation in the state 
of Para, Brazil Shown here is a section of 
the Jamanxim National Forest where illegal 
clear-cutting has occurred. Large areas of 
deforestation like this one are not uncommon 
in the Amazonian rainforest.
■ The health status of millions of people is projected to be 
affected through, for example, increase in malnutrition; 
increased deaths, diseases, and injury due to extreme 
weather events; increased burden of diarrheal diseases; 
increased frequency of cardiorespiratory diseases due to 
higher concentrations of ground-level ozone in urban areas 
related to climate change; and the altered spatial distribu-
tion of some infectious diseases.
■ Global climate change is causing sea levels to rise as polar ice 
caps melt which will greatly affect coastal areas across the 
globe. This effect is already occurring in northern polar regions 
as well as among small islands in the southern hemisphere.
■ Population growth patterns and the changing geography 
of economic development allow us to predict with some 
confidence that the air and water pollution generated by 
low-income countries will more than double in the next 10 
to 15 years as they become more industrialized.
■ Climate change is already exacerbating current stresses 
on water resources from population growth and economic 
and land-use change, including urbanization.
■ The resilience of many ecosystems is already compromised 
in some places and is likely to be exceeded this century by 
an unprecedented combination of climate change, associ-
ated disturbances (e.g., flooding, drought, wildfire, insects, 
ocean acidification), and other global change drivers (e.g., 
land-use change, pollution, fragmentation of natural sys-
tems, overexploitation of resources).
The causes and consequences of these global climate 
changes vary considerably by where in the world they are 
unfolding. For example, the industrial countries have higher 
carbon dioxide emissions. Increased carbon dioxide emissions 
are contributing to rising temperatures through the trapping of 
heat in Earth's atmosphere. In order to survive in many of the 
world's peripheral regions, the rural poor are often impelled 
to degrade and destroy their immediate environment by cut-
ting down forests for fuelwood, leading to the destruction of  
forests, which help to cool Earth's surface (Figure 4.16). 
Thus, both the core and the periphery are contributing 
to the problem of global climate change in different, but 
 significant, ways. Moreover, environmental problems are 
becoming inseparable from processes of demographic change, 
 economic development, and human welfare and are becom-
ing increasingly enmeshed in matters of national security and  
regional conflict.
What's to Be Done?
There are many ways that individuals, organizations, and gov-
ernments can begin to address the effects of climate change as 
described earlier, from using compact fluorescent light bulbs, 
buying local produce, and using reusable water bottles instead 
of disposable ones; developing and expanding local food 
resources; and supporting clean energy sources such as solar 
and wind power.
One increasing popular strategy for reducing GHGs is emis-
sions trading. Already an established practice, emissions trad-
ing allows governments to regulate the amount of emissions 
produced in aggregate by setting the overall cap but allowing 
corporations the flexibility of determining how and where the 
emissions reductions will be achieved. Corporations that want 
to limit their emissions are allocated allowances, with each 
allowance representing a ton of the relevant emission, such as 
carbon dioxide. Corporations can emit in excess of their allo-
cation of allowances by purchasing allowances from the mar-
ket. Similarly, a company that emits less than its allocation of 
allowances can sell its surplus allowances.
The Climate Change Controversy
Despite overwhelming consensus from the international scien-
tific community, a small number of critics—known as climate 
change deniers or skeptics—do not accept that Earth's climate 
is being changed by human activities. These individuals are 
generally not climate scientists and they do not publish in

the following link to an article in Scientific Ameri-
can that addresses them. It provides fact-based evi-
dence to rebut climate change skepticism.
The IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report: Mitiga-
tion of Climate Change (2014) provides helpful 
data about the state of the world's climate and 
efforts to mitigate the effects of global warm-
ing in a format that is easily accessible to a lay 
audience. The report understands mitigation 
as an effort to stabilize greenhouse gases in the 
atmosphere to prevent the dangerous effects of 
human-induced change. It also recognizes that 
mitigation must be achieved in such a way that 
ecosystems will not be fatally threatened, food 
production will not be compromised, and eco-
nomic development will occur in a sustainable 
manner (Figure 4.17).
peer-reviewed scientific journals or engage in debate at con-
ferences on climate science. Yet many of them are influential 
individuals as members of Congress or as chief officers of large 
corporations and as such have access to news media that feel 
compelled to offer a balanced perspective on the problem. The 
objective of this group of climate skeptics is to delay or prevent 
action by government to address climate change such as initia-
tives to push for alternative energy sources or tighter regula-
tions for high-polluting energy like coal. Their approach has 
been to insist that global warming is a theory, not a fact, and as 
such, little or no regulatory action is needed.
A comprehensive study of 928 articles published on 
climate change in peer-reviewed scientific journals over 
a ten-year period found that not one of the articles dis-
agreed with the scientific consensus that human-induced 
climate change is occurring. To gain a better understanding

ENERGY, LAND-USE CHANGE  
AND ENVIRONMENT
Certainly the most central and significant technological break-
through of the Industrial Revolution was the discovery and utili-
zation of fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas. Although the very 
first factories in Europe and the United States relied on water-
power to drive machinery, hydrocarbon fuels provided a more 
constant, dependable, and effective source of power. A steady 
increase in power production and demand since the beginning 
of the Industrial Revolution has been paralleled, not surprisingly, 
by an increase in resource extraction and conversion. Box 4.2, 
"Spatial Inequality: Energy Consumption and Production" pro-
vides insight into the global variation that exists in energy use.
Energy Needs and Environmental 
Impacts
The burning of home heating oil, along with the use of petro-
leum products for fuel in internal combustion engines, also 
launches harmful chemicals into Earth's atmosphere—caus-
ing air pollution and related health problems. The production 
and transport of oil have resulted in oil spills and substantial 
pollution of water and ecosystems. Media images of damage 
to seabirds and mammals after tankers have run aground and 
spilled oil have shown how immediate the environmental 
damage can be. Indeed, the oceans are acutely affected by the 
widespread use of oil for energy purposes. There is no better 
example of the damage of oil spills to the environment than 
the accident that occurred when British Petroleum's Deep-
water Horizon oil rig exploded and caught fire on April 20, 
2010, in the Gulf of Mexico, 400 km (250 miles) offshore of 
Houston.
The explosion killed 11 people and injured at least two 
dozen more when a blowout preventer, intended to check the 
release of oil, failed to activate. As the well continued to leak 
an estimated 40,000 barrels of oil a day before it was effec-
tively capped, oil slicks spread across the Gulf from Florida to 
Texas, contaminating the environment and seriously damaging 
the Gulf coastal fisheries and tourism economy, especially in 
Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and northern Florida. When 
the well was finally capped three months after the explosion, 
it is estimated that a total of 4.9 million barrels, or 205.8 mil-
lion gallons, of oil had been released into the environment. As 
the world's largest accidental oil spill to date, it will continue 
to contaminate or damage marine and terrestrial life—both 
human and nonhuman (Figure 4.18). Despite the huge cost of 
the Gulf oil spill cleanup (estimated at $40 billion) to British 
Petroleum, the company registered a 17 percent profit in its 
2011 first-quarter earnings.
Natural gas is one of the least noxious of the hydrocarbon-
based energy resources because its combustion is relatively 
clean. Now supplying nearly one-quarter of global commer-
cial energy, natural gas is predicted to be the fastest-growing 
energy source in this century. Reserves are still being discov-
ered, with Russia holding the largest amount—about one-third 
of the world's total (Figure 4.19). While regarded as a preferred 
alternative to oil and coal, natural gas is not produced or con-
sumed without environmental impacts. The risk of explosions 
at natural gas conversion facilities is significant; groundwater 
contamination and leakages and losses of gas from distribution 
systems contribute to the deterioration of Earth's atmosphere, 
as well as increasingly, some of the unintended effects of frack-
ing as a form of natural gas mining.
▶ Figure 4.18 Oil spill caused by the explosion of the Deep-
water Horizon rig Pictured is an aerial view of crude oil on May 
24, 2010, in Elmer Island, Louisiana. Skimmer ships, floating contain-
ment booms, anchored barriers, and sand-filled barricades were 
assembled along shorelines as chemical dispersants were used to 
attempt to prevent hundreds of miles of beach and wetlands from 
the spreading oil. In addition, underwater plumes of dissolved oil 
not visible on the surface and a 210 kilometer (80 square mile) "kill 
zone" surrounding the blown well were reported by scientists.

HUMAN GEOGRAPHY   Places and Regions in Global Context
At present, the world's population relies most heavily for its energy needs on 
nonrenewable energy resources that include fossil fuels and nuclear energy, 
as well as renewable resources such as biomass, solar, hydroelectric, wind, 
4.2   Spatial Inequality 
Energy Consumption and Production
and geothermal power. The distribution and production of the world's en-
ergy resources as well as its consumption, however, are deeply spatially un-
even (Figure 4.D & 4.E). Currently, 30 percent of the world's oil supplies are 
located in the Middle East, and most of the coal is mined from the Northern 
Hemisphere, with China accounting for 41 percent of world production, fol-
lowed by the United States at 19 percent, and the former Soviet Union at 
8 percent. Nuclear reactors are a phenomenon of the core regions of the 
world as well. For example, France has 59 nuclear reactors operated by gov-
ernment-owned Electricité de France, supplying the country with over 430 
billion kilowatt hours of electricity per year, which is 78 percent of the total 
generated there.
The consumption of energy is also spatially unequal as it relies on the 
ability to pay as well as the ability to afford the mitigation costs of its envi-
ronmental impacts. In one year, global energy consumption is equal to about 
1.3 billion tons of coal. What is most remarkable is that this is four times what 
the global population consumed in 1950 and 20 times what it consumed 
in 1850. The affluent core regions of the world far outstrip the peripheral 
regions in energy consumption. With nearly four times the population of the 
core regions, the peripheral regions account for less than one-third of global 
energy expenditures. Yet consumption of energy in the peripheral regions 
is rising quite rapidly as globalization spreads industries, energy-intensive 
consumer products such as automobiles, and energy-intensive agricultural 
practices into regions of the world where they were previously unknown. 
It is projected that within the next decade or so, the peripheral regions will 
become the dominant consumers of energy-dependent products from ap-
pliances to homes to vehicles. 
Finally the effects of energy production and consumption are also un-
evenly experienced. Every stage of the energy conversion process—from dis-
covery to extraction, processing, and utilization—has an impact on the physical 
landscape as well as the populations who live on or near that landscape. In 
the coalfields of the world, from the U.S. Appalachian Mountains to western 
Siberia, mining results in a loss of vegetation and topsoil, in erosion and water 
pollution, and in acid and toxic drainage. It also contributes to cancer and lung 
disease in coal miners. Coal burning, is associated with relatively high emissions 
of environmentally harmful gases, such as carbon and sulfur dioxide, most di-
rectly affects populations living close to coal plants, especially in countries with 
limited environmental regulations.

HUMAN GEOGRAPHY   Places and Regions in Global Context
And yet, while some core countries have moved 
away from nuclear energy because of the possibility 
of environmental disaster in the absence of fail-safe 
reactors, many more—and especially populous—
developing countries are moving in the opposite 
direction, even in the wake of the Fukushima disas-
ter (Figure 4.20). Given that world energy consump-
tion is predicted to increase by 57 percent between 
now and 2030, it is not surprising that rapidly 
developing countries like India, South Korea, and 
China have growing nuclear energy programs. And 
developing Eastern European countries like Czechia 
and Romania, as well as Russia and Belarus, are 
continuing to invest in nuclear power.
Biomass and Hydropower
While nuclear power problems are still largely con-
fined to the core, the periphery is not without its 
energy-related environmental problems. Because a 
large proportion of populations in the periphery rely 
on biomass for their energy needs, as the popula-
tions have grown, so has the demand for fuelwood. 
One of the most immediate environmental impacts of 
wood burning is air pollution, but the most alarming 
environmental problem is the rapid depletion of for-
est resources. With the other conventional sources of 
energy (coal, oil, and gas) being too costly or unavailable to most 
peripheral households, wood or other forms of biomass—any 
form of material that can be used as fuel, such as animal waste, 
livestock operation residues, and aquatic plants—is the only 
alternative. The demand for fuelwood has been so great in many 
peripheral regions that forest reserves are being rapidly used up 
(Figure 4.21).
Fuelwood depletion is extreme in the highland areas of 
Nepal, as well as in the Bolivian and Peruvian Andes Moun-
tains. The clearing of forests for fuelwood in these regions has 
led to serious steep-slope soil erosion. In sub-Saharan Africa, 
where 90 percent of the region's energy needs are supplied by 
wood, overcutting of the forests has resulted in denuded areas, 
especially around rapidly growing cities. And although wood 
gathering is usually associated with rural life, it is not uncom-
mon for city dwellers as well to use wood and other forms of 
biomass to satisfy their household energy needs. In Niamey, 
the capital of Niger, the zone of overcutting is expanding as the 
city itself expands. It is estimated that city dwellers in Niamey 
travel from 50 to 100 kilometers (31 to 62 miles) to gather wood. 
The same goes for inhabitants of Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso, 
where the average haul for wood is also over 50 kilometers. And 
fuelwood use in Asian and South American highland regions as 
well as in sub-Saharan Africa is expected to continue to increase 
substantially (34 percent by some estimates) over the next 
decade, at least.
Hydropower Hydroelectric power, also known as 
 hydropower, was once seen as a preferred alternative to 
the more obviously environmentally polluting and nonre-
newable fossil-fuel sources. The wave of dam building that 
▲ Figure 4.20 Disaster at Fukushima nuclear power plant Shown in the background 
is the black smoke from the burning power plant caused by an earthquake that generated a 
tsunami that struck the power facility causing reactor explosions.  
At the midpoint of the twentieth century, nuclear energy 
was widely promoted as a clearly preferable alternative to fossil 
fuels. It was seen by many as the answer to the expanding energy 
needs of core countries, especially as the supply of uranium 
worldwide was thought to be more than adequate for centuries 
of use. Nuclear energy was also regarded as cleaner and more 
efficient than fossil fuels. Although nuclear war was a pervasive 
threat, and there were certainly critics of nuclear energy even in 
the early years of its development, the civilian "atomic age" was 
widely seen as a triumphant technological solution to the energy 
needs of an expanding global economic system.
It was when serious accidents at nuclear power plants began 
to occur—such as those at Windscale in Britain and Three Mile 
Island in the United States, Chernobyl in Russia, and now Fuku-
shima in Japan—that the voices of concerned scientists and citi-
zens were raised in opposition. Incontestable evidence points to 
the need to address the problems associated with nuclear energy 
production, such as how to ensure nuclear reactor safety and 
how to safely dispose of nuclear waste (which remains radioac-
tive for tens of thousands of years). After the devastating acci-
dents and meltdowns, many countries decided to go nuclear-
free, such as Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and New Zealand. In 
light of the recent meltdown at the Fukushima plant in Japan, 
the safety of nuclear energy is again being publicly debated. 
France, for example, which derives 75 percent of its electricity 
from nuclear energy power, saw protests against its continued 
use emerge in the spring of 2011. Other opposition to nuclear 
power occurred across Europe in Germany, Bulgaria, Italy, and 
the United Kingdom as well as in the United States, Asia, and 
Latin America.

CHAPTER 4   People and Nature   157
▲ Figure 4.21 Global consumption of fuelwoods Firewood, charcoal, and dung are considered traditional fuels, and although their availability 
is decreasing, dependence upon them is increasing. Dependence on traditional sources of fuel is especially high in the periphery, where, in Africa, 
for example, they are the most important energy source for cooking and heating. Wood and charcoal, although renewable sources, are replenished 
very slowly. Acute scarcity will be a certainty for most African households in the twenty-first century. (Source: Data from UN Food and Agricultural  Organization, State of

occurred throughout the world over the course of the twen-
tieth century improved the overall availability, quality, cost, 
and  dependability of energy as well as harnessed water re-
sources for food production, generation, flood control, and 
domestic use (Figure 4.22). Unfortunately, however, dams 
built to provide hydroelectric power (as well as water for ir-
rigation, navigation, and drinking) for the burgeoning cities 
of the core and to encourage economic development in the 
periphery and semiperiphery have also had profound nega-
tive environmental impacts. Among the most significant of 
these impacts are changes in downstream flow, evaporation, 
sediment transport and deposition, mineral quality and soil 
moisture, channeling and bank scouring, and aquatic biota 
and flora, as well as the development of conditions threaten-
ing to human health.
Furthermore, the construction of dams dramatically 
alters terrain, often with serious consequences. For example, 
clearance of forests for dam construction often leads to large-
scale flooding. Felled trees are usually left to decay in the 
impounded waters, which become increasingly acidic. The 
impounded waters can also incubate mosquitoes, which carry 
diseases such as malaria. The effects on human populations 
are also significant as dam projects often require the reloca-
tion of long-settled populations. These populations are often 
indigenous and their displacement disrupts dense social net-
works, generations-long connections to the land, as well as 
established livelihoods.
Despite these problems and in response to the rising cost 
of fossil fuels, the use of hydroelectricity is expected to con-
tinue to expand over the next two decades by 1.9 percent per 
year, particularly where its use is supported by government 
policies and incentives, such as in Asia and South America. 
The construction of the Three Gorges Dam, as well as several 
other large-scale hydroelectric projects in China, illustrates 
this trend (Figure 4.23). In contrast, most of the increase in 
energy production in core countries is expected to be in renew-
able resources, as shown in Box 4.3 "Visualizing Geography: 
Renewable Energy Resources."
Energy-Related Pollutants One reason hydroelectric 
power continues to be appealing in the periphery is that it 
produces fewer atmospheric pollutants than fossil fuels. In-
deed, coal and gas power stations as well as factories, automo-
biles, and other forms of transportation are largely responsible 
for the increasingly acidic quality of Earth's atmosphere. Al-
though it is true that people as well as other organisms nat-
urally produce many gases, including oxygen and carbon

United States, and Canada, in the 1950s and eventually came 
to be seen as an environmental concern as well. Acid depo-
sition poisons soils and water bodies that become too acidic 
to support life. In urban areas, acid rain corrodes marble and 
limestone structures, affecting important buildings such as 
the Parthenon in Athens and St. Paul's Cathedral in London 
as well as others in Europe. By the late 1990s, however, acid 
deposition became far less of a problem in Europe and North 
America as decades of environmental regulations and coopera-
tive agreements diminished the release of of chlorflourocar-
bons (CFCs) into the atmosphere. The problem has not gone 
away entirely, however, and is emerging with great negative 
effect in Asia, especially China, where few governmental limits 
on industrial pollution are in place. In fact, because of rapid 
industrial growth, China has some of the world's most polluted 
cities and rivers. The steady emissions of sulfur dioxide from 
unregulated factories and vehicles has resulted in one-third 
of China's territory being affected by acid rain, posing a major 
threat to soil water and food safety.
dioxide, increasing levels of industrialization and motor ve-
hicle use have contributed to the destablization of the long-
term balance of such gases, leading to serious atmospheric 
pollution. Sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and hydrocarbons, 
among other gases, which are released into the atmosphere 
from motor vehicle exhaust, industrial processes, and power 
generation (based on fossil fuels), are increasing the level of 
acids in the atmosphere. If these gases reach sufficient concen-
trations and are not effectively dispersed in the atmosphere, 
acid rain can result.
Acid rain or acid deposition, as it is known scientifically, 
is the wet deposition of acids upon Earth through the natural 
cleansing properties of the atmosphere. The term acid rain also 
includes acid mists, acid fogs, and smog. Acid rain occurs as the 
water droplets in clouds absorb certain gases that later fall back 
to Earth as acid precipitation. Figure 4.24 illustrates the wide-
spread nature of acid emissions. The problem first emerged as 
a health problem in the industrial countries of the Northern 
Hemisphere, especially the United Kingdom, Scandinavia, the

land from one use to another (e.g., the conversion of forest to 
settlement). Modification is an alteration of existing land use 
(e.g., a grassland overlaid with railroad line or a forest thinned 
and not clear-cut).
One of the most dramatic impacts is loss or alteration of 
forest cover, which humans have cleared for millennia to make 
way for cultivation and settlement. Forests are cleared not 
only to obtain land to accommodate population increases but 
also to extract the vast timber resources they contain. The for-
ested area of the world has been reduced by about 8 million 
square kilometers (about 3 million square miles) since prea-
gricultural times. Rapid clearance of the world's forests has 
occurred through logging, settlement, and agricultural clearing 
or through fuelwood cutting around urban areas. Figure 4.25 
shows the global extent of deforestation in recent years.
Forests The permanent clearing and destruction of forests, 
deforestation, is currently occurring most alarmingly in the 
world's rain forests. The UN Food and Agricultural Organiza-
tion has estimated that we are destroying rain forests globally 
at the rate of 0.40 hectare (1 acre) per second. Today, rain for-
ests cover less than 7 percent of the land surface, half of what 
they covered only a few thousand years ago.
Destruction of the rain forests, however, is not just about 
the loss of trees, a renewable resource that is being eliminated

▲ Figure 4.25 Global deforestation Since agriculture emerged about 10,000 years ago, human activities have diminished the world's forest resources by 
about 25 percent. Whereas forests once occupied about one-third of Earth's surface, they now take up only one-quarter. Forests filter air and noise pollution, 
provide a habitat for wildlife, and slow down water runoff, helping to recharge streams and groundwater. They also influence climate at local, regional, and 
global levels. (Source: World Resources Institute, http://images.wri.org/sdm-gene-02-deforestation.jpg or http://www.wri.org/image/view/10981/_original.)

more quickly than it can be regenerated. It is also about the loss 
of the biological diversity of an ecosystem. This also translates 
into the potential loss of biological compounds that may have 
great medical value. In addition, the destruction of rain forests 
can lead to the destabilization of the oxygen and carbon diox-
ide cycles of the forests, which may have long-term effects on 
global climate.
Much of the destruction of the South American rain for-
ests is the result of peripheral countries' attempts at economic 
development. In the Bolivian Amazon rain forest, the introduc-
tion of coca production has become an important source of rev-
enue for farmers in the region and has led to the removal of 
small tracts of forest. The pressure of economic development 
persists in the region such that net rain forest and forest land 
more generally are continuing to decline in Central and South 
America at a faster rate than in the 1990s.
Great geographical variability exists with respect to 
human impacts on the world's forests. For most of the core 
regions, the forests that were once cleared have been replaced 
by regeneration. For most of the periphery, in contrast, clear-
ance has accelerated to such an extent that one estimate shows 
a 50 percent reduction in the amount of forest cover since the 
early 1900s.
Cultivated Lands Cultivation is another important compo-
nent of global land use, which we will deal with extensively in 
Chapter 9. In this section, we briefly cover one or two points 
about the environmental impacts of cultivation that are partic-
ularly pertinent to our current discussion. During the past 300 
years, the land devoted to cultivation has expanded globally 
by 450 percent. In 1700, the global stock of land in cultivation 
took up an area about the size of Argentina. Today, it occupies 
an area roughly the size of the entire continent of South Amer-
ica. While the most rapid expansion of cropland since the mid-
twentieth century has occurred in the peripheral regions, the 
amount of cropland has either held steady or been reduced in 
core regions. The expansion of cropland in peripheral regions 
is partly a response to growing populations and rising levels of 
consumption worldwide. It is also due to the globalization of 
agriculture (see Chapter 9), with some core-region production 
having been moved to peripheral regions.
The phenomenon of corporations and rich governments 
investing in the agricultural land of peripheral countries is 
often called a "land grab" in the popular press. While it is 
impossible to know exactly how much peripheral land is being 
sold to investors, because land deals are often secret, there are 
reliable estimates. The Land Coalition, a nongovernmental 
organization, estimates that by 2011 almost 80 million hect-
ares had been subject to some sort of negotiation with a foreign 
investor, more than half in Africa (Figure 4.26). To appreciate 
just how much land this is, 80 million hectares is more than 
all the farmland of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, 
and Italy combined. Big investors are countries with concerns 
about feeding their own people that purchase farmland abroad

It is important to realize that alternatives exist to fossil fuels, 
hydroelectric power, and nuclear energy. Energy derived from
the sun, the wind, Earth's interior (geothermal sources), and
the tides, is clean, proﬁtable, and dependable (Figure 4.1.1). 
Japan, the US, and Germany all have solar energy production 
facilities that are cheap and nonpolluting. The production of 
energy from geothermal and wind sources has also been 
successful in a few locations around the globe. Italy, Germany, 
Iceland, the US, Mexico, Denmark, and the Philippines all
derive some of their energy production from geothermal or
wind sources (Figure 4.4.1).

A signiﬁcant change in energy consumption is greater efficiency of use. In the US, for example, average household energy use 
dropped between 1978 and 2010. However, the increased use of electronic devices—cell phones, televisions, computers—is partly 
offsetting these greater efficiencies. Energy consumption to fuel the increasing use of these devices is expected to double over the 
next 10 years (Figure 4.3.1).

Most of the world's energy consumption is for transportation. Hybrid (HEV) and plug-in electric vehicles (PEV) are limited due to the 
high cost of this technology. City and county governments in the US and large corporations like Federal Express (FedEx) are 
converting their transportation ﬂeets to hybrids. Hybrid and electric automobiles are also very popular in Europe and the United 
Kingdom. By mid-2011, sales of new hybrid and electric cars were growing faster than sales of conventional vehicles in the US, the 
largest vehicle market in the world. The growing hybrid and electric automobile market is being bolstered by the ﬂeet market, which 
every year sees new commitments to all-electric delivery vehicles.

as a guarantee of future food supplies. China is the largest of 
these investors, buying or leasing twice as much land as any-
one else, usually in Africa. The most worrying aspect of these 
land grabs is the high levels of corruption among the buyers 
and low levels of benefit for the sellers.
Grasslands Distinct from agricultural land, grasslands are 
also used productively the world over, either as rangeland or 
pasture for livestock grazing. Most grasslands are found in 
arid and semiarid regions that are unsuitable for farming due 
to lack of water or poor soils (Figure 4.27). Some grasslands, 
however, occur in more rainy regions where tropical rain for-
ests have been removed. Others are at the mid-latitudes, such 
as the tall- and short-grass prairies of the central United States 
and Canada. Approximately 68 million square kilometers (26 
million square miles) of global land surface is currently taken 
up by grasslands.
Human impacts on grasslands are largely of two sorts. 
The first is the clearing of grasslands for other uses, most fre-
quently settlement. As the global demands for beef production 
have increased, the use of the world's grasslands has intensi-
fied. Widespread overgrazing of grasslands has led to acute 
degradation. In its most severe form, overgrazing has led to 
desertification.
Desertification is the spread of desert conditions result-
ing from deforestation, overgrazing, and poor agricultural 
practices, as well as reduced rainfall associated with climatic 
change. Until recently, one of the most severe examples of 
desertification had been occurring in the Sahel region of 
Africa. The degradation of the grasslands bordering the Sahara 
Desert has not been a simple case of careless overgrazing by 
thoughtless herders, however. Severe drought, recurrent 
famine, and the breakdown of traditional systems for cop-
ing with disaster have all combined to create increased pres-
sure on fragile resources, resulting in a loss of grass cover and 
extreme soil degradation since the 1970s. However, increas-
ing evidence is suggesting that between 1982 and 2000 the 
desertification in this region has been declining (Figure 4.28). 
Scientists believe they are seeing signals that the Sahara Des-
ert and surrounding regions are actually greening—adding 
biomass including grasses as well as trees—due to increasing 
rainfall. The increased rainfall may be the result of global cli-
mate change, which is leading to warmer temperatures. Hotter 
air can hold more moisture, which in turn creates more rain. 
Aerial photographs as well as ground studies have confirmed 
the greening phenomenon. The most optimistic projection  
of the various climate models that attempt to better understand 
the impacts of the greening is that the rains could continue

of wetlands to conversion. For the last 400 years or so, people 
have regarded wetlands as nuisances and as sources of disease. 
In core countries, technological innovation made modification 
and conversion of wetlands possible and profitable.
In San Francisco, California, the conversion of wetlands in 
the mid-nineteenth century allowed speculators and real estate 
developers to extend significantly the central downtown area 
into the once marshy edges of San Francisco Bay. The Gold 
Rush in the Sierra Nevada sent millions of tons of sediment 
down the rivers into the bay, filling in its marshland and reduc-
ing its nearshore depth. It is estimated that in 1850 the San 
Francisco Bay system, which includes San Pablo Bay as well 
as Suisun Bay, covered approximately 315 square kilometers 
(about 120 square miles). One hundred years later, only about 
125 square kilometers (about 50 square miles) remained. By 
the 1960s, the conversion and modification of the wetlands (as 
to revitalize drought-ravaged regions, providing new grazing 
lands for farming communities.
Wetlands The wetlands category covers swamps, marshes, 
bogs, peatlands, and the shore areas of lakes, rivers, oceans, 
and other water bodies. Wetlands can be associated either with 
saltwater or freshwater. Most of Earth's wetlands are associated 
with the latter (Figure 4.29). The human impacts on wetland 
environments are numerous. The most widespread has been 
the draining or filling of wetlands and their conversion to other 
land uses, such as settlement or cultivation. One reliable es-
timate places the total area of the world's wetlands at about 
8.5 million square kilometers (3.3 million square miles), with 
about 1.5 million square kilometers (0.6 million square miles) 
lost to drainage or filling. For example, Australia has lost all 
of its original 20,000 square kilometers (7,740 square miles) 
◀ Figure 4.28 Greening of the Sahel  
Desertification has been a significant prob-
lem in many parts of the world, particu-
larly in Africa south of the Sahara Desert. 
Overgrazing of fragile arid and semiarid 
rangelands and deforestation without 
reforestation have been the chief causes. 
Recently, however, there is growing evi-
dence of increasing biomass production in 
this region as a result of increasing rainfall. 
This figure is based on trend analyses of 
time series over the Sahel region from 1982 
to 1999. (Source: NOAA AVHRR NDVI-data from 1982

of fish, fowl, and marine life that the viability of the ecosys-
tem was seriously threatened. Since then, restoration activities 
have been undertaken and parts of the bay have returned to 
something approximating their former state, but large parts are 
heavily urbanized and cannot be restored.
Water Use and Access
One of the most crucial elements in the relationship between 
people and their environment is water. We can't live without 
it and all of our economic practices depend on it. For instance, 
it takes 150 gallons of water to produce one newspaper; 1,000 
gallons for one quart of orange juice, 2,500 gallons for 1 pound 
of beef, and 40,000 gallons of water for one new car. The water 
embedded in the production of the food or other things we 
consume is referred to as virtual water (Figure 4.30).
Without abundant water, people in the core could not 
live the high-quality lives they currently enjoy; without clean 
water, those in the periphery die. It's therefore important to 
question what our lives would be like if the price of water was 
as volatile as, for example, oil. The price of oil has risen and 
fallen repeatedly due to civil unrest in the Middle East most 
recently, but also to the power of 12 countries—known as the 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)—to set 
oil production schedules and prices. Privatized water could 
be subject to similar conditions and price effects when private 
companies set the price for water and not governments. 
Water rates in most municipalities around the world are 
subsidized since water is absolutely essential to life and the 
"real" cost of water—acquisition, treatment, delivery, waste 
management—can be prohibitive. Moreover, subsidies exist 
not just for households but also for agriculture and industries. 
And yet, while people in the core enjoy artificially low water 
costs because the government subsidizes the price of water, in 
the periphery populations have been feeling the effects of esca-
lating water prices for nearly a decade, and in some places far 
longer. The 2013 UN Human Development Report states that 
1.1 billion people in peripheral countries do not have ade-
quate access to water, with 2.6 billion lacking basic sanitation. 
Almost two-thirds of the people lacking access to clean water 
survive on less than $2 a day. Access to piped household water 
is unequal, with 85 percent of the wealthiest 20 percent of the 
population having adequate access, compared to a meager 20 
percent of the poorest 20 percent of the population. Perhaps 
most disturbing is the statistic that 1.4 million children will 
die each year from lack of access to safe drinking water and 
sanitation.
Experts around the world have begun to talk about a global 
"water crisis," which is occurring not because there is a short-
age, but because water as a public good is rapidly turning into 
a privatized commodity. That is, the privatization of water 
(rather than the provision of water through publicly owned 
utilities)—touted as a way of bringing equitable access and effi-
ciency to all water users—has instead led to increased prices 
and accessibility problems for poor and marginalized peoples 
not only in the global periphery but in peripheral areas of 
many core countries as well (Figure 4.31).
Nearly two decades ago, many governments—national as 
well as local—looked to the privatization of water as a way 
of unburdening themselves of a relatively expensive service 
in response to the public's demand for smaller government. 
Corporations—mostly multinational ones—began buying up 
municipal water providers and offering water provision based 
on profit-and-loss considerations.

CHAPTER 4   People and Nature   167
International water companies such as Paris-based Suez, the 
largest water company, Veolia (formerly Vivendi), also French and 
the world's second-largest water giant, and RWE, a German utility 
conglomerate, are competing for water supplies across the world. 
Since 2002, Lexington, Kentucky, for instance, has been fighting 
to regain control of its local water utility from RWE. The water 
privatization in New Orleans was predicted to be the largest pri-
vate water contract in the nation when it was proposed in 2000. 
Vivendi (as it was then known) and Suez vied to profit from con-
trol of Crescent City's (California) water supply. The deal was pre-
dicted to be worth more than $1.5 billion over the next 20 years. 
Ultimately, the city was able to defeat the takeover.
Reports abound across the United States and the globe 
of the private purchase of local water supplies and resulting 
rate hikes, negative economic impacts, inadequate customer 
service, and harm to natural resources. The bottom line is 
that water—clean, drinkable water—like lots of other natural 
resources, is becoming increasingly scarce and an attractive 
investment opportunity. One of the most significant challenges 
of the twenty-first century will be how to ensure the wide 
accessibility of adequate supplies of quality drinking water for 
the world's people.
In response to the global water privatization movement, 
individuals as well as governments and nongovernmental orga-
nizations are increasingly arguing that access to safe and ade-
quate supplies of water should be seen as a human right and that 
large corporations are not capable of guaranteeing that right. It is 
important to be aware that the conflict over who should provide 
safe water is occurring in cities and towns throughout the core as 
well as the periphery. Besides issues of access and public safety,

Cooperation summit meeting in Bangkok in 2003; around 
the UN climate negotiations conference in Copenhagen, Den-
mark, in 2009; and again during the UN climate conference 
in Cancún, Mexico, in 2010. Telecommunications as well as 
Facebook, Twitter, and other social media sites enable pro-
test leaders to organize and deploy demonstrators from inter-
ested groups all over the world. Such political protests reflect 
attempts to match the political reach of institutions like the 
WTO, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World 
Bank, and the United Nations.
One indication of the expanding influence and geograph-
ical extent of popular political groups is the growth of envi-
ronmental organizations whose purview and membership are 
global. These organizations have emerged in response to the 
global impact of such contemporary environmental problems 
as fisheries depletion, global warming, genetically modified 
seeds, and the decline in global biodiversity. Since the 1990s, 
these groups—ranging from lobbying organizations and non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) to direct-action organi-
zations and political parties like the Green Party in Europe 
and drawing on distinctive traditions and varying levels of 
resources—have become an important international force. 
Increasingly, agreements and conventions protecting biodiver-
sity are being created, and not a moment too soon. The decline 
in the diversity of simple foodstuffs, like lettuce, potatoes, 
tomatoes, and squash, occurred most dramatically over the 
course of the twentieth century. For instance, in 1903 there 
were 13 known varieties of asparagus; by 1983 there was just 
one, a decline of 97.8 percent. There were 287 known varieties 
of carrots in 1903; this number today is just 21, a fall of 92.7 
percent. A decline in the diversity of foodstuffs means that dif-
ferent resistances to pests inherent in these different varieties 
have also declined, as have their different nutritional values 
and tastes. It should be pointed out, however, that a growing 
local food movement in the core countries is working hard to 
recover some of these lost varieties (Figure 4.32).
Moreover, new sources of medicine may be lost not only 
because of deforestation in tropical forests but also because 
of the decline in indigenous languages, cultures, and tradi-
tions. Recognizing that many indigenous people have exten-
sive knowledge of local plants and animals and their medici-
nal uses, the Convention on Biological Diversity that emerged 
from the Rio Summit in 1992 is attempting to protect global 
biodiversity by preserving and protecting these cultures and 
traditions. Traditional knowledge and practices are being lost 
as globalization homogenizes languages and draws more and 
more people into a capitalist market system. The UN Environ-
ment Program devotes a great deal of its energies to biological 
and cultural diversity. Even the WTO has begun to recognize 
the value of indigenous knowledge and the promise of bio-
diversity through its advocacy of intellectual property rights 
of both corporations and indigenous peoples. For the latter, 
this means protection against bioprospecting, the scientific 
or commercial practice of searching for a useful application, 
process, or product in nature, often in extreme environments 
such as deserts, rain forests, and cold places like the Arctic 
and Antarctic.
many of those opposing water privatization argue that conflicts 
over water are really about fundamental questions of democracy. 
In particular, if water is no longer a public good, who will make 
the decisions that affect our future access to it and who will be 
denied access? This question is an especially significant one as 
climate change is expected to have dramatic impacts on water 
quality and quantity throughout the world.
APPLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE
1. What is the "global water crisis"? Think about the change from 
 water as a public good to a private commodity.
2. Conduct an Internet search to find a core country and a peripheral 
country that share a common environmental concern relating to 
threats to forests, grasslands, or wetlands. Compare and contrast 
the different ways core and peripheral countries are addressing 
the same issue.
THE STATE OF THE GLOBAL 
ENVIRONMENT
The combustion of fossil fuels, the destruction of forest 
resources, the damming of watercourses, and the massive 
change in land-use patterns brought about by the pressures 
of globalization—industrialization being the most extreme 
phase—contribute to environmental problems of enormous 
proportions. It is now customary to speak of the accumulation 
of environmental problems we, as a human race, experience as 
global in dimension. Very little, if anything, has escaped the 
embrace of globalization, least of all the environment.
In fact, no other period in human history has transformed 
the environment as profoundly as the anthropocene. While we 
reap the benefits of a modern way of life, it is important to rec-
ognize that these benefits have not been without cost. Fortu-
nately, the costs have not been accepted uncritically. Over the 
last two to three decades, responses to global environmental 
problems have been on the increase as local groups have mobi-
lized internationally.
Global Environmental Governance
The increasing importance of flows and connections— 
economic, political, social, and cultural—means that contem-
porary globalization has resulted in an increasingly shrinking 
world. In addition to allowing people and goods to travel far-
ther faster and to receive and send information more quickly, 
a smaller world means that political action has also become 
connected across the globe. It can now move beyond the con-
fines of the state into the global political arena, where rapid 
communications enable complex supporting networks to be 
developed and deployed, facilitating interaction and deci-
sion making. Good examples can be seen in the protests that 
occurred at the World Trade Organization (WTO) meeting 
in Seattle, Washington, in 1999; at the Group of 8 (G8) sum-
mit in Genoa, Italy, in 2001; at the Asian Pacific Economic

4.4 Window on the World
At its most basic, ecotourism is responsible travel that conserves or im-
proves the local environment as well as supports the well-being of the 
people who inhabit it. Ecotourism is also known as sustainable tourism 
and its goals, as defined by the leading sustainable tourism organiza-
tion, the International Ecotourism Society, are provided in the following 
declaration:
The elements of ecotourism include environmental conservation that 
is accomplished through including local communities in decision-making as 
well as inviting tourism that is premised on the principle of  sustainability. 
The bottom line in making tourism ecologically sound is to support the  
participation of partners—both communities and tourists—who operate in 
environmentally sustainable ways."
The Movement
The ecotourism movement, now 20 years old, has established guidelines, 
standards, policies, and a global agenda meant to standardize practices 
to assure that all ecotourism programs adhere to a high level of perfor-
mance on a range of activities, including conservation, community capacity 
building, and knowledge and understanding transfer between tourists and 
local communities. The United Nations declared 2002 the International 
Year of Ecotourism to help bring NGOs, governments, and industry to-
gether to support the growth and development of sustainable tourism 
practices around the globe. Ecotourism experiences are varied and de-
pend very much on the activities and environmental and social conditions 
of the destination (Figure 4.F).
The Experience
The New York Times publishes an ecotourism guide as part of its very pop-
ular Travel feature. It lists a wide range of ecotourism opportunities on its 
Web site that range from archaeology through to beaches, cruises, gay and 
lesbian destinations, spas, surfing and wildlife encounters in sites across the 
planet. One such trip includes the highly endangered Galapagos Islands, a 
chain of 19 remote volcanic islands that have mostly been converted to na-
tional parkland 600 miles off the coast of Ecuador. There visitors can drift 
with sea turtles and swim with sea lions and observe all sorts of birdlife.

Visitors are not expected to do much more than adhere to strict rules that 
prevent the introduction of nonnative species to the islands and contribute 
money to support the preservation of this UNESCO World Heritage site. A 
more engaged ecotourism experience can include a wide range of activities 
from working with a local community in Costa Rica to helping fund and con-
struct a school for local children to developing microenterprises—bakeries, 
sustainable fishing tours, basket-making for tourist consumption—to partici-
pating in animal rescue programs (Figure 4.G).
The Criticisms
As ecotourism has grown in popularity, so too have criticisms of its ethos 
and practices. Some point out that the term ecotourism is itself an oxymo-
ron as tourism in general depends upon increasing air travel and the green-
house gas emissions that accompany it and contributes to global warming 
and climate change. The problem, many critics of ecotourism point out, 
is that the regulation of ecotourism is poorly implemented or nonexistent 
since helicopter tours of the Grand Canyon and cruises to Antarctica can be 
categorized as ecotourism along with camping and canoeing. But the list of 
problems that some see as endemic to ecotourism is long:
■ Revenues bypass the local communities experiencing the tourism.
■ Tour operators within natural areas do not adhere to ecotourism 
principles.
■ Local communities are forced to leave their homes to ensure a more 
"natural" experience for tourists.
■ Government resources are redirected from social programs to envi-
ronmental ones that don't generate positive impacts for both.
■ Tourist infrastructure creates conflict over preexisting land uses.
■ Effects of increasing ecotourism are too great for local water-treat-
ment and sanitation facilities.
It must be appreciated that ecotourism is a consumer-centered 
economic activity that might be seen, by its very nature, to be con-
trary to sustaining the environment.
Solutions
Many of the extreme ecotourism critics would argue that ecotour-
ism should mean no tourism! Since this extreme response is unlikely 
to be adopted, there are other ways that ecotourism can more 
closely adhere to its basic principles. These require that tourists be 
better educated about their impacts, even those who believe they 
have none, such as hikers, who contribute to soil impaction and 
erosion and plant damage. These include:
■ Assuring the economic benefits of ecotourism are spread so that 
local communities are significant beneficiaries (Figure 4.H).
■ Making sure that management plans are in place so that local 
natural resources are sustained.
■ Informing ecotourists of the local social organization and cul-
tural practices and how they can be respectful visitors.
There are moves currently within the ecotourism industry to 
create tour guide training programs, so that tourists can become 
directly informed about the impacts of their visit; establish national 
and international accreditation standards that rate programs on 
their level of environmental commitment; and establish national 
ecotourism certification programs. Add to these measures routine 
and formal environmental impact assessments at the site and there 
could be a strong form of accountability in place. While all of these 
 measures are controversial in one way or another, at least one of 
them has already been put into place in a handful of countries.

Clearly, global environmental awareness is on the rise from 
both ends of the political spectrum, including the conserva-
tive (such as the WTO) and the progressive (such as programs 
devoted to preserving genetic diversity in seed strains). This 
increasing awareness is directly responsible for the staging of 
global environmental conferences like Rio in 1992, Kyoto in 
1997, and the signing of the Montreal Protocol in 1987, a treaty 
meant to halt the growing hole in the ozone layer over Antarc-
tica. Over 25 years ago, scientists and policymakers unveiled 
what the United Nations calls "the most successful treaty in UN 
history." Nearly 200 nations signed the Montreal Protocol on 
Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer and thereby agreed 
to ban the use of chlorine- and bromine-based 
chemicals (particularly chlorofluorocarbons, or 
CFCs) that destroy atmospheric ozone. It is widely 
accepted that this international agreement likely 
saved the world from an environmental crisis, 
while setting an example for how to develop and 
implement environmental policy (Figure 4.33).

Environmental Sustainability
The interdependence of economic, environmental, and social 
problems, often located within widely different political con-
texts, means that some parts of the world are ecological time 
bombs. Most environmental threats are greatest in the world's 
periphery, where daily environmental pollution and degrada-
tion amount to a catastrophe that will continue to unfold in 
slow motion in the coming years. One approach to this prob-
lem that has emanated from core countries is ecotourism, also 
known as sustainable tourism. We examine this well estab-
lished but still growing form of alternative tourism in Box 4.4, 
"Window on the World: Ecotourism."
In the peripheral regions there is simply less money to 
cope with environmental threats. The poverty endemic to 
peripheral regions also adds to environmental stress. In order 
to survive, the rural poor are constantly impelled to degrade 
and destroy their immediate environment, cutting down for-
ests for fuelwood and exhausting soils with overuse. In order 
to meet their debt repayments, governments generate export 
earnings by encouraging the harvesting of natural resources. In 
the cities of the periphery, poverty encompasses so many peo-
ple in such concentrations as to generate its own vicious cycle 
of pollution, environmental degradation, and disease. Even cli-
mate change, an inherently global problem, seems to pose its 
greatest threats to poorer, peripheral regions.
A more benign relationship between nature and society has 
been proposed under the principle of sustainable development, a 
term that incorporates the ethic of intergenerational equity, with 
its obligation to preserve resources and landscapes for future gen-
erations. Sustainable development involves employing ecological, 
economic, and social measures to prevent environmental degrada-
tion while promoting economic growth and social equality. Sus-
tainable development insists that economic growth and change 
should occur only when the impacts on the environment are 
benign or manageable and the impacts (both costs and benefits) 
on society are fairly distributed across classes and regions. This 
means finding less-polluting technologies that use resources more 
efficiently and managing renewable resources (those that replenish 
themselves, such as water, fish, and forests) to ensure replacement 
and continued yield. In practice, sustainable development policies 
of major international institutions, such as the World Bank, have 
promoted reforestation, energy efficiency and conservation, and 
birth control and poverty eradication programs to reduce the envi-
ronmental impact of rural populations.
But cities and towns throughout the world have also 
launched policies and practices meant to foster sustainability 
at the local level. These include reorganized municipal waste 
programs, where cities collect organic waste and turn it into 
rich and usable soil, or remove some of the most problematic 
elements of it to keep it from entering into landfills or even 
converting organic waste to energy. The recycling networks are 
not only local but can span the globe so that material deemed 
as waste in an affluent country can be exported to a less afflu-
ent one where it takes on new value in a different context. 
Indeed, the global transfer of obsolete goods is big business 
so that in 2008, the transfer of scrap and other waste material 
exceeded the value of all semi-conductors and electronic goods 
exported by the United States to China (Figure 4.34).
There is also an emerging movement known as "transition 
towns." The practices undertaken in this movement are based on 
groups of active citizens who wish to improve the resilience of 
their communities in the face of threats like climate change and 
even economic uncertainty. These citizens work collaboratively 
to find local solutions. As their Web site states, transition towns:
... succeed by regeneratively using their local assets, in-
novating, networking, collaborating, replicating proven 
strategies, and respecting the deep patterns of nature 
and diverse cultures in their place. Transition initia-
tives work with deliberation and good cheer to create a 
fulfilling and inspiring local way of life that can with-
stand the shocks of rapidly shifting global systems.3

The past 25 years have seen a growing public awareness 
of how continued globalization will affect the world. Increas-
ingly, citizens, nongovernmental organizations, and environ-
mental policymakers are expressing concern over the negative 
outcomes of rapid and enduring global economic growth. How-
ever, because growth is so critically tied to improving the lives 
of poor people around the world, governments are reluctant to 
limit it. The response from the global community, hammered 
out during international meetings, through academic publica-
tions, and in response to social protest, is to link globalization 
to governmental cooperation across states with the assumption 
that global challenges will require international political and 
economic cooperation.

The continued expansion of the global economy and the glo-
balization of industry will undoubtedly boost the overall de-
mand for raw materials and energy and continue to shape the 
relationship between people and nature. While the extraction 
of raw materials will be important in the future, the issue of 
most concern, by far, will be energy resources. World energy 
consumption has been increasing steadily. As the periphery is 
industrialized and its population increases further, the demand 
for energy will expand even more rapidly. Basic industrial 
development tends to be highly energy-intensive. The Inter-
national Energy Agency, assuming (fairly optimistically) that 
energy in peripheral countries will be generated in the future 
as efficiently as it is in developed ones now, estimates that de-
veloping-country energy consumption will more than double 
by 2025, lifting total world energy demand by almost 50 per-
cent. Unless peripheral countries are able to limit the degra-
dation associated with energy use, the globe will continue to 
feel the negative public health and environmental effects of air, 
water, and terrestrial pollution.
Despite the threat to people and the environment, indus-
trialization geared to meeting the growing worldwide market 
for consumer goods, such as automobiles, air conditioners, 
refrigerators, televisions, and household appliances, will con-

The relationship between people and nature is to a great ex-
tent mediated by institutions and practices, from technology 
to religious beliefs. In this chapter, we have seen how the na-
ture-society relationship has changed over time and how the 
globalization of the capitalist world economy has had a more 
widespread impact on attitudes and practices than any cultural 
or economic system that preceded it.
The expansion of European trade, followed by coloniza-
tion and eventually industrialization, broadcast worldwide the 
belief that humans should take their place at the apex of the 
natural world. The Western attitude toward nature as mani-
fested by the capitalist economic system is the most pervasive 
shaper of nature-society interactions today.
In addition to exploring the history of ideas about nature 
and contemporary environmental philosophies and organiza-
tions in the United States, this chapter has also shown that 
people and nature are interdependent and that events in one 
part of the global environmental system affect conditions in 
the system elsewhere. Finally, we have shown that events in 
the past have shaped the contemporary state of society and 
nature.
In short, as economies have globalized so has the environ-
ment. We can now speak of a global environment in which not 
only the people but also the physical environments where they 
live and work are linked in complex and essential ways.
Along with the recognition of a globalized environment 
have come new ways of thinking about global economic devel-
opment. Sustainable development, one of these new ways of 
thinking, has come to dominate the agenda of international in-
stitutions, as well as environmental organizations, as the new 
century unfolds.

LEARNING OUTCOMES REVISITED
■ Describe the drivers and impacts of climate change and state 
your position with respect to it within current debates.
The scientific evidence for global climate change is both 
extensive and widely accepted and includes increasing 
temperatures, sea level rise, glacial melt, species migra-
tion, and persistent drought, among other signals. The 
impacts of climate change are already being felt widely 
through increasing numbers of tropical storms and ac-
companying storm surges as well as ecosystem degrada-
tion. Projected impacts include coastal land submersion 
and accompanying forced population migration. Climate 
skepticism can easily be countered by reference to scien-
tific evidence.
■ Summarize how the globalization of the capitalist political 
economy has affected the environment so that environmental 
problems have become increasingly global in scope.
No other transition in human history has had the impact 
on the natural world that industrialization and urbaniza-
tion have. The combustion of fossil fuels, the destruction 
of forest resources, the damming of watercourses, and the 
massive change in land-use patterns brought about by the 
pressures of globalization contribute to environmental 
problems of enormous proportions. Geographers and oth-
ers use the term global change to describe the combination 
of political, economic, social, historical, and environmen-
tal problems with which human beings across Earth must 
currently contend.
■ Evaluate the ways that sustainability has become a predomi-
nant approach to global economic development and environ-
mental transformation.
Sustainable development involves employing ecological, 
economic, and social measures to prevent environmen-
tal degradation while promoting economic growth and 
social equality. Sustainable development insists that eco-
nomic growth and change should occur only when the im-
pacts on the environment are benign or manageable and 
the impacts (both costs and benefits) on society are fairly 
distributed across classes and regions. This means find-
ing less-polluting technologies that use resources more 
efficiently and managing renewable resources (those that 
replenish themselves, such as water, fish, and forests) to 
ensure replacement and continued yield.
■ Describe how people and nature come to form a complex 
relationship in which nature is understood as both a physical 
realm and a social construct.
Nature is not only an object, it is a reflection of society in 
that the philosophies, belief systems, and ideologies peo-
ple produce shape the way we think about and employ 
nature. Society is the sum of the inventions, institutions, 
and relationships created and reproduced by human be-
ings across particular places and times. The relationship 
between nature and society is two-way: Society shapes 
people's understandings and uses of nature at the same 
time that nature shapes society.
■ Compare the many views of nature operating both historically 
and in society today, from the traditional Western approach to 
the radical left and contemporary ecotheological approaches.
In the contemporary world, views of nature are dominated 
by the Western (also known as Judeo-Christian) tradition 
that understands humans to be superior to nature. In this 
view, nature is something to be tamed or dominated. But 
other views of nature have emerged that depart dramati-
cally from the dominant view. These include the environ-
mental philosophies that became popular in the nineteenth 
and early twentieth centuries and the more radical po-
litical views of nature that gained prominence in the late 
twentieth century. Among the latter are approaches based 
on ecotheology, which reject the long-standing consump-
tion-based Western tradition.
■ Explain how extensive human settlement, colonization, and 
accelerated capitalist development have transformed nature  
in unprecedented ways.
In the fifteenth century, Europe initiated territorial expan-
sion that changed the global political map and launched 
dramatic environmental change. Europeans were fast 
running out of land, and explorers were dispatched to 
conquer new territories, enlarge their empires, and col-
lect tax revenues from new subjects. European people, 
ideologies, technologies, plant species, pathogens, and 
animals changed the environments into which they were 
introduced and the societies they encountered. The re-
verse was also true as the societies they encountered 
changed Europe. European colonization ultimately helped 
to stimulate rapid industrialization and urbanization, 
both of which have had profound effects on the global 
environment.

1. Many communities produce an index of environmental 
stress, in essence a map of the toxic sites in a city or 
region. Plot a rudimentary map like this of your own 
community using the local phone book as a data source. 
Consult the Yellow Pages to identify the addresses of 
environmentally harmful and potentially harmful busi-
nesses, such as dry-cleaning businesses, gas stations, au-
tomotive repair and car-care businesses, aerospace and 
electronic manufacturing companies, agricultural supply 
stores, and other such commercial enterprises where 
noxious chemicals may be produced, sold, or applied. 
Alternatively consider your campus or neighborhood 
and where its most toxic sites are. Your school or local 
directory is the ideal place to start.
2. Conduct research on the natural history of any country 
or region for which information is easily available. What 
sorts of plants and animals dominated the landscape there 
during the Paleolithic period? Do any plants or animals 
continue to survive in altered or unaltered forms from 
that period? What new plants have been introduced and 
how extensive are they? What sorts of tending and main-
tenance do these new species require and how have they 
changed the landscape? Finally, with the information you 
have gathered, create a map of the paths that these specific 
plants have taken to arrive in this region.      
 3. Colleges, universities, offices, and hospitals are large gen-
erators of waste, from plain-paper waste to biomedical and 
other sorts of waste, which can have significant environ-
mental impacts. Identify how any one of the institutions 
handles this waste stream and how you, as a member of 
society, contribute to it. Where does the waste go when 
it leaves the site? Is it locally deposited? Does it go out of 
state?
 1. Consider the relationship between industrialization and 
physical geography by examining mountain top removal in 
Appalachia. Visit the Beehive Collective graphic campaign 
entitled "The True Cost of Coal" at http://www.beehivecol-

philosophies that the Beehive Collective most closely adheres 
to. (Hint: Is it the collective part of the environmental justice 
or ecofeminist movements? Or a combination of a variety of 
different theories?) Explain your choice. Be specific in the 
reasons you give by citing examples from the organization's 
Web site. List four examples of how the graphics on the site 
depict the complex relationship between nature and society.
 2. Colleges and universities have become much more  
involved in sustainability over the last decade. Visit the 
College Sustainability Report Card Web site at http://
www.greenreportcard.org/about/faq and draw your own 
rating mechanism for your institution. Discuss how your 
institution might improve the practice of sustainability or 
how sustainability practices engaged in at your institution 
can be transferred elsewhere across the globe.
 3. As you know from this chapter, Gallup, Inc. has conducted 
a national survey of environmental attitudes in the United 
States every year since 1986. Visit their Web site at http://

tigate the kinds of questions asked as well as the results 
from the survey. Selecting what you feel are the most 
pertinent questions for your region or the country, design 
your own questionnaire and administer it to students on 
your campus or to the residents in your locality, and then 
analyze the survey results. How do the attitudes of your 
fellow students or residents compare with those of the 
Americans? Determine why they might be the same or dif-
ferent. Be aware that Gallup does categorize responses by 
age category.

DATA ANALYSIS
In this chapter, we have examined the interac-
tions between society and nature from the per-
spective that humans shape the natural world, 
be it with technology, population growth or de-
cline, the exchange between cultures (seen in 
ecological imperialism), energy consumption, 
and/or global awareness of climate change. To 
analyze more deeply how human intervention impacts the 
environment and the effects of climate change on certain 
communities, look at the Alaska Native village of Newtok 
with this interactive site: "America's Climate Refugees" at: 
http://www.theguardian.com/environment/interactive/2013 
/may/13/newtok-alaska-climate-change-refugees
Watch and read the three different multimedia sections: 
1) "America's first climate refugees"; 2) An undeniable truth?; 
and 3) "It's happening now... The village is sinking." As you 
listen to the video stories, read the reports and analyze the 
maps to answer these questions:
 1. Why is Newtok sinking?
 2. How is climate change a direct threat to the Newtok com-
munity's existence?
 3. Why is the Arctic, particularly Alaska, at risk for the early 
effects of climate change? How have Alaskan politicians 
responded to climate change?
 4. Look at the map on the page, "The at risk list" (http://
www.theguardian.com/environment/interactive/2013 
/may/14/alaska-villages-frontline-global-warming). Why 
do Alaska's indigenous communities face some of the most 
detrimental effects from climate change? Think about both 
geographic location and economic realities. Do you see 
any aspects of ecological imperialism at play?
 5. Watch the video story, "Life in Newtok is Difficult" (in 
the "It's happening now... The village is sinking" section,  
http://www.theguardian.com/environment/interactive 
/2013/may/15/newtok-safer-ground-villagers-nervous). 
Why are goods so expensive? What resources does the 
community have in comparison to the cost of living?
 6. What are some of the proposals to save Newtok? How  
feasible are those solutions?
 7. How effective was the Charles family's "great escape" 
from Newtok to Metarvik (http://www.theguardian.com 
/environment/interactive/2013/may/13/alaskan-family 
-newtok-mertarvik)?
 8. With all of this information, how is climate change affect-
ing certain communities more than others? Do you think 
this is fair? How complicit are all countries in creating 
climate change? Should there also be a global response to 
solve these issues?

Thailand is considered to have one of the highest, if not the high-
est, number of transgendered people worldwide.1 Transgender is the term 
that refers to a person whose self-identity does not conform to conventional 
notions of the male or female gender. There is no official count, but knowl-
edgeable scholars estimate the number to be close to 200,000. This number 
would not come as a surprise to visitors to Thailand and might even be re-
jected as an underestimate given kathoeys ubiquity. Indeed, surf the Internet 
and you'll find kathoeys repeatedly touted as an interesting and exciting fea-
ture of nightlife in the city.
Kathoey is the Thai term that refers largely to male-to-female transgender. 
Kathoeys, or "lady boys" as they refer to themselves and are referred to by 
others, are everywhere in Bangkok but also live openly in rural villages across 
the country. Importantly, many Thai people perceive kathoeys as not comfort-
ably fitting into the category of transgender and prefer to recognize them as 
belonging to a third gender—that is they are neither male nor female—while 
others, including many kathoeys themselves, view them as either a kind of 
man or a kind of woman. Equally important is the fact that while certainly 
marginalized, as are most sexual minorities around the world, in Thailand, 
the kathoey enjoy wide acceptance and even national fame.
Scholars have been drawn to understanding kathoeys because of the fact that 
they live and move through Thai society fluidly and seemingly with little 
harassment. Survey research on the ubiquity of kathoeys in Thai society has 
shown that both children and adults can often identify at least one kathoey 
in their school or village. In short, it appears that there are a large number of 
males in Thailand who decide to make a dramatic transition from one gen-
der to another and researchers believe that, among other reasons, geographic 
factors—that is, the particular characteristics of Thailand, and especially its 
cultural characteristics—help explain this phenomenon.

are actually dynamic contextual factors that underlie 
the expression of significant differences, despite appar-
ent similarities. In this chapter, as shown here in the 
kathoey example, we explore culture as a process that 
is not understandable outside of the geographical con-
text in which it operates.
CULTURE AS A GEOGRAPHICAL 
PROCESS
Anthropologists, geographers, and other scholars who study 
culture, such as historians and cultural studies specialists, 
agree that culture is a complex concept. Over time, our under-
standing of culture has been changed and enriched. A simple 
definition of culture is that it is a particular way of life, such 
as a set of skilled activities, values, and meanings surround-
ing a particular type of practice. Scholars also describe culture 
in terms of classical standards and aesthetic excellence in, for 
example, opera, ballet, or literature.
Culture
The term culture also describes the range of activities that 
characterize a particular group, such as working-class culture, 
corporate culture, or teenage culture. Although all these under-
standings of culture are accurate, for our purposes they are 
incomplete. Broadly speaking, culture is a shared set of mean-
ings that is lived through the material and symbolic practices 
of everyday life. Our understanding in this book is that culture 
is not something that is necessarily tied to a place and thus a 
fact to be discovered. Rather, we regard the connections among 
people, places, and cultures to be emerging and always evolv-
ing creations that can be altered sometimes in subtle and at 
other times in more dramatic ways. The "shared set of mean-
ings" can include values, beliefs, practices, and ideas about 
family, childhood, race, gender, sexuality, and other important 
identities or other strong associations such as vegetarianism or 
a devotion to Star Trek (Figure 5.1). These values, 
beliefs, ideas, and practices are routinely subject to 
reevaluation and redefinition and can be, and very 
frequently are, transformed from both within and 
outside a particular group.
In short, culture is a dynamic concept that 
revolves around and intersects with complex 
social, political, economic, and even historical 
factors. For much of the twentieth century, geog-
raphers, like anthropologists, have focused most 
of their attention on material culture, as opposed 
to its less tangible symbolic or spiritual manifes-
tations. This understanding of culture is part of a 
longer tradition within geography and other disci-
plines. We will look more closely at the develop-
ment of the cultural tradition in geography in the 
following section, in which we discuss the debates 
surrounding culture within the discipline.
The first one has to do with spiritual beliefs: in Judeo-
Christian tradition, sex and gender are rather strictly 
defined in terms of human anatomy. In Thailand, how-
ever, which is a largely Buddhist country, gender is  often 
defined in terms of the social roles males or females 
 perform in the home or in the public sphere. At the same 
time, sex roles are correlated not with the sexual organs 
one has, but with what one does with them.
Importantly, as in most other cultures, though Thais 
also operate through stereotypes of male and female 
 behaviors, the differences between them in terms of 
those personal characteristics, is actually smaller than 
elsewhere. In short, males and females are seen as far 
more similar to each other than in other cultures and, 
moreover, women are very highly revered in Thailand. 
The result is though physically the transition from 
male to female is a significant one, psychologically it is 
less so in a country where families pay a bride price to 
marry off their sons, not their daughters.
Finally, Thai Buddhism is a highly tolerant belief sys-
tem that recognizes homosexuality and transgender as 
the result of karma, a misdeed or transgression from a 
past life. As such, the current life of a kathoey is deter-
mined by the consequences of their past lives and thus 
they deserve acceptance and understanding and not 
scorn and rejection as anyone can be affected by karma.
Kathoeys provide an important window into the com-
plexity of culture, particularly at the intersection with 
sexuality (including sexual role and sexual anatomy) 
and gender (including gender identity and gender pre-
sentation). It helps us see that though sexuality and 
gender may appear to be the same worldwide, there

CHAPTER 5   Cultural Geographies   181
Geography and Culture
The place-based interactions occurring between culture and 
global political and economic forces are at the heart of cul-
tural geography today. Cultural geography focuses on the way 
space, place, and landscape shape culture at the same time that 
culture shapes space, place, and landscape. As such, cultural 
geography demarcates two important and interrelated parts. 
Culture is the ongoing process of producing a shared set of 
meanings and practices, while geography is the dynamic con-
text within which groups operate to shape those meanings and 
practices and in the process form an identity and act. Geog-
raphy in this definition can be a space that is as small as the 
body and as large as the globe.
A Two-Way Relationship
A contemporary example of this two-way relationship between 
geography and culture can be seen in the widespread popu-
larity of online social networks designed to connect friends, 
family, co-workers, and people with similar interests. The most 
popular online social networking website Facebook—with 
around 1.23 billion active monthly users worldwide—allows 
members to share photos, blogs, music, and videos, and a host 
of other personal information, as well as organize events, join 
groups, or seek relationship partners. In 2014, Facebook cel-
ebrated its tenth birthday. The social media site is increasingly 
important not just as a location for social connection but also 
for other forms of connection from economics to politics. For 
instance, Facebook and other social media played an impor-
tant role in the Arab Spring and continue to be used in politi-
cal ways around the world. Obama's first presidential election 
was thought to have been successful in part for its use of social 
media.
And while Facebook and other virtual networks have 
revolutionized the way people communicate with each other, 
there is far more to the Internet than connecting with old 
friends and making new ones. Perhaps the most powerful 
force on the Internet now is something known as the "Internet 
of things," called this because of the power of the Internet 
to connect objects, that is things like cars, refrigerators, and 
home security systems, across time and space. Connectivity 
is obviously a powerful economic force as investors see the 
Internet of things as a new "industrial revolution." But it's 
also a powerful cultural force as it transforms the way we, 
as cultural beings, relate to these connected objects and the 
relationships they generate with other things and people 
through their connectivity. Figure 5.3 is an illustration of one 
kind of connectivity that the  Internet of things will enable. 
The figure shows how the Internet's ability to connect things 
across space can make our lives less subject to unexpected 
disruption thus making life less frustrating and more efficient 
economically.
What it doesn't show is the how increasing connectivity 
across things also creates inequalities and challenges to fun-
damental rights such as privacy. Yes, having all your monthly 
bills get consolidated into one that is immediately registered 
and paid by your bank is highly convenient. But it also means 
Like agriculture, politics, and urbanization, globaliza-
tion has had effects on culture. Terms such as world music 
or global connectivity are a reflection of the sense that the 
world seems a smaller place now as people everywhere are 
sharing aspects of the same culture through the widespread 
influence of television, the Internet, and other media. Yet, 
as pointed out in Chapter 2, although powerful homogeniz-
ing forces are certainly at work, the world has not become 
so uniform that place no longer matters. With respect to cul-
ture, just the opposite is true. Place matters more than ever 
in the negotiation of global forces, as local forces confront  
globalization and translate it into unique place-specific 
forms (Figure 5.2).

Traditions of Cultural Geography
Before we proceed any further in our discussion of culture, it 
is important to discuss a significant difference between our 
view and that of more traditional cultural geographers. Many 
introductory human geography texts divide culture into two 
major categories: folk and popular culture. Folk culture is 
seen by specialists as the traditional practices of small groups, 
especially rural people with a simple lifestyle (compared with 
modern, urban people), such as the Amish in Pennsylvania 
or the Roma (also known as Gypsies or Travelers) in Europe, 
who are seen as homogeneous in their belief systems and prac-
tices. Popular culture, by contrast, is viewed by some cultural 
geographers as the practices and meaning systems produced by 
large groups of people whose norms and tastes are often het-
erogeneous and change  frequently, often in response to com-
mercial products.  Hip-hop would be seen by these theorists as 
an example of popular culture,
In this text, we do not divide culture into categories. 
We see culture as an overarching process that is shaped by 
and shapes politics, the economy, and society and cannot 
be neatly demarcated by reference to the number of char-
acteristics or degree of homogeneity of its practitioners. We 
see culture as something that can be enduring as well as 
newly created, but always influenced by a whole range of 
interactions as groups maintain, change, or even create tra-
ditions from the material of their everyday lives. For us, 
there is no purpose served in categorically differentiating 
between hip-hop and Hinduism, as both are significant 
expressions of culture and both are of interest to geogra-
phers (Figure 5.4).
that powerful corporations come to know a lot about you that 
you may not want them to. Moreover, as the Internet becomes 
increasingly connected across all of our things in 
some parts of the world, other parts will not be 
able to be so connected as they can't afford the 
cost of the "smartness" of these things. Experts 
who study the impact of technology on society, 
culture, and ethics have reservations about the 
kinds of changes that the Internet of things will 
bring about.
But it's not just that the Internet of things will affect issues 
of privacy; it's also that the things themselves will change our 
cultural practices too, such as dating, physical intimacy, and 
marriage. An obvious example is the way the Internet allows 
couples in long-distance relationships to connect in their own 
private shared space. The app "Couple" has a feature called 
ThumbKiss™, which allows distant couples to send a kiss 
when each of the couple touches the same spot on a smart-
phone that makes their smartphones vibrate simultaneously.
In the United States, marriage ceremonies and recep-
tions using drones and bots are gaining popularity. As 
drones fly over the wedding party taking videos from above 
they communicate with bots on the dance floor that are 
capturing conversation and snapping candid photographs. 
The film Her (2013), directed by Spike Jonze and starring 
Joaquin Phoenix, attempted to address the issue of how the 
Internet of things, and computers more generally, has the 
power to dramatically affect some of the most basic cul-
tural institutions of contemporary life such as companion-
ship and love.

CHAPTER 5   Cultural Geographies   183
BUILDING CULTURAL 
COMPLEXES
Geographers focus on the interactions between 
people and culture and among space, place, 
and landscape. One of the most influential 
geographers was Carl Sauer, who taught at the 
 University of California, Berkeley, in the early 
to mid- twentieth century. Sauer was largely 
responsible for creating the  "Berkeley School" 
of cultural geography. He was particularly 
interested in trying to understand the material 
 expressions of culture by focusing on their man-
ifestations in the landscape (Figure 5.5).
Cultural Landscape
Sauer's interest in culture and geography came 
to be embodied in the concept of the cultural 
landscape, a characteristic and tangible out-
come of the complex interactions between a 
human group—with its own practices, preferences, values, and 
aspirations—and its natural environment. The concept of the 
cultural landscape is illustrated in Box 5.1 Visualizing Geog-
raphy: UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Sauer differentiated the 
cultural landscape from the natural landscape. He emphasized 
that the former was a "humanized" version of the latter, such 
that the activities of humans resulted in an identifiable and

Based on a convention adopted in 1974 and ratified by 191 countries, the World Heritage Program works with countries around the globe to 
nominate, protect, manage, raise public awareness and foster international cooperation in the conservation of the world's most significant 
cultural and natural heritage landscapes (Figure 5.1.1). There are over 1000 properties that have been accepted for World Heritage status.
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization's (UNESCO) World Heritage Program provides an 
excellent example of the concept of cultural landscape and how it is being adopted and adapted today.  The mission of the 
UNESCO is to "encourage the identification, protection and preservation of cultural and natural heritages around the world 
considered to be of outstanding value to humanity."

HUMAN GEOGRAPHY   Places and Regions in Global Context
The cultural landscape is fashioned 
from a natural landscape by a cultural group. 
Culture is the agent, the natural area is the 
medium, the cultural landscape is the result. 
Under the influence of a given culture, itself 
changing through time, the landscape under-
goes development, passing through phases, 
and probably reaching ultimately the end of 
its cycle of development. With the introduc-
tion of a different—that is an alien—culture, 
a rejuvenation of the cultural landscape sets 
in, or a new landscape is superimposed on 
remnants of an older one.2
European Approaches to 
Culture and Place
In Europe, geographers interested in human interactions 
with the landscape took slightly different approaches. For 
example, in Great Britain the approach to understanding the 
human imprint on the landscape was termed historical geog-
raphy, while in France it was conceptualized as genre de vie. 
Historical geography, very simply defined, is the geography 
of the past. Its most famous practitioner was H. C. Darby, 
who attempted to understand "cross sections" or sequences 
of evolution, especially of rural landscapes. Genre de vie, a 
key concept in Vidal de la Blache's approach to cultural geog-
raphy in France, referred to a functionally organized way of 
life characteristic of a particular culture group. Genre de vie 
centered on the livelihood practices of groups that were seen 
to shape physical, social, and psychological bonds (Figure 5.7). 
Although emphasizing some landscape components over oth-
ers or giving a larger or smaller role to the physical environ-
ment, all of these approaches placed the cultural landscape at 
the heart of their study of human- environment interactions.
H. C. Darby most successfully implemented his historical 
approach to cultural geography and landscape by developing a 
geography based on the Domesday Book, a key historical docu-
ment. William the Conqueror ordered the Domesday compiled 
in 1085 so he could have a list of his spoils of war. The book 
provides a rich catalog of the ownership of nearly every tract of 
land in England. It includes the names of landholders in each 
county; the manors they held and their values; the names of 
their subtenants; the names of many boroughs and details of 
their customs; the number of freemen, sokemen (freemen land-
holders), unfree peasants, and slaves on each manor; and the 
resources of each manor. Geographers like Darby found such 
data invaluable for reconstructing the political, economic, and 
social forces that shaped past landscapes.
Vidal de la Blache emphasized the need to study small, 
homogeneous areas to uncover the close relationships that 
exist between people and their immediate surroundings. He 
constructed multifarious descriptions of preindustrial France 
that demonstrated how the various genres de vie emerged 
understandable alteration of the natural environment. Figure 5.6  
lists the differences between a natural and a cultural land-
scape. While the original diagram from Sauer's work is obvi-
ously static, the arrow of time can be complicated by all sorts 
of events such as, for the natural landscape, earthquakes and 
volcanic eruptions, or slower weathering processes brought 
about by wind or water. The cultural landscape component of 
the diagram should also be understood to recognize that time 
is active and ongoing and processes like industrialization or 
political revolution and war can dramatically shape both the 
natural and human landscape.
Critique of Sauer's Cultural Landscape
Sauer's ideas about the effect of cultural practices on the physi-
cal landscape are a little less than a century old and have been 
challenged and critiqued by geographers over the years. The most 
prominent challenge was leveled by James Duncan who rejected 
the implicit notion of culture upon which Sauer built the cultural 
landscape concept. Duncan argued that Sauer had adopted what 
he called a "superorganic" notion of culture in this conceptual-
ization. What he meant was that for Sauer culture seemed to be 
something that was somehow exterior to humans, a kind of well 
that humans drew from to make sense of the world. Duncan and 
most contemporary geographers reject this view and see culture, 
as we do in this book, as a set of meanings and practices that are 
produced as humans go about living their lives.
For roughly five decades, interest in culture within the 
field of U.S. geography largely followed Sauer's important 
work. His approach to the cultural landscape was ecological, 
and his many published works reflect his attempts to under-
stand the myriad ways that humans transform the surface of 
Earth. In his own words:
▲ Figure 5.6 Sauer's cultural landscape This figure summarizes the ways 
that natural and cultural landscapes are transformed. Physical and climatic 
factors shape the natural landscape. The results of cultural factors are cultural 
forms, such as population distributions and patterns of housing. Over time, 
people—through culture—reshape the natural landscape to meet their 
needs. (Adapted from C. Sauer, "The Morphology of Landscape," in J. Leighly

constitute a particular cultural group. The 
use of chopsticks is an example of a cultural 
trait. Chopsticks are a common eating imple-
ment across China as well as other parts of 
Asia from Vietnam to Japan. As this example 
illustrates, cultural traits are not necessarily 
unique to one group, and understanding them 
is only one aspect of the complexity of cul-
ture (Figure 5.9).
Another example of a cultural trait is a 
rite of  passage. These are acts, customs, prac-
tices, or procedures that recognize key transi-
tions in human life—birth, menstruation, and 
other markers of adulthood, such as sexual 
awakening and marriage. Rites of passage are 
not uncommon among many of the world's 
cultures. Some non-Western cultures, for 
example, send adolescent boys away from the 
village to experience an ordeal—ritual scar-
ring or circumcision, for example—or to med-
itate in extended isolation on the new roles they must assume 
as adults (Figure 5.10).
Cultural Complexes and Regions
Cultural traits always occur in combination. The combination 
of traits characteristic of a particular group is known as a cul-
tural complex. Referring back to our example of chopsticks, 
a cultural complex in which they figure prominently would 
include other elements such as culinary preferences, foods 
associated with holidays or special events, and activities such 
as toasts and drinks or prayers to celebrate those events.
Another concept key to traditional approaches in cultural 
geography is the cultural region. Although a cultural region 
may be quite extensive or very narrowly described and even 
from the possibilities and constraints posed by local physi-
cal environments. Subsequently, he wrote about the changes 
in French regions brought on by industrialization, observing 
that regional homogeneity was no longer the unifying element. 
Instead, the increased mobility of people and goods produced 
new, more complex geographies where previously isolated 
genres de vie were integrated into a competitive industrial 
economic framework. Anticipating the widespread impacts of 
globalization, de la Blache also recognized how people in vari-
ous places struggled to cope with the big changes transforming 
their lives.

Cultural Traits
Geographers also examine specific aspects of culture, 
ranging from single attributes to complex systems. 
One simple aspect of culture of interest to geogra-
phers is the idea of special traits, which include such 
things as distinctive styles of dress, dietary habits, and 
styles of architecture (Figure 5.8). A cultural trait is a 
single aspect of the complex of routine practices that

HUMAN GEOGRAPHY   Places and Regions in Global Context
5.2 Geography Matters 
Contemporary cultural geographers study both practices and 
 representations—that is, they are interested both in people's actual actions 
and in how those actions are talked about and written about. Because hu-
man beings communicate significantly (though not exclusively) through 
language, both what we do and what we say are important. Cultural geog-
raphers are interested in understanding how people make meaning in their 
daily lives through complex, entangled webs of practices and representa-
tions. And one interesting thing about the way people make meaning is that 
those meaningful places, objects, and stories do not have to be factual. 
How Art Shapes Place
Cultural geographers studying literature and film, for example, explore 
how works of fiction and film help shape place identities and stimulate cul-
tural flows. Consider how the recent Lord of the Rings and Hobbit films, 
both shot on locations across New Zealand, have stimulated tourism to 
New Zealand, complete with scene-by-scene location guides. While it's 
possible that some Hobbit tourists believe they are actually visiting "Middle 
Earth" (or wish they were), more likely they simply enjoy seeing the "actual" 
places where scenes from a favorite film were shot. It's also common for tour-
ists to buy souvenirs that remind them of favorite films or works of fiction. 
Souvenirs associated with the Harry Potter novels include Gryffindor key 
rings, Hogwarts crest mugs, and Voldemort wand/pens and are available 
at Oxford University in the UK where scenes from the novels were filmed; 
there the Cathedral Shop gift store now offers fiction-inspired items along-
side school-branded clothing and recordings of the University's choir. Such 
fictional worlds can stimulate more than tourism and souvenir purchases—
they can actually shape place identity (Figure 5.A). 
This was the case with the nineteenth-century novel Ramona written by 
Helen Hunt Jackson. Jackson's 1884 novel sought to draw readers' atten-
tion to the plight of the California Mission Indians who had been denied 
treaty rights, and whose lands were being stolen, crops and homes pillaged; 
they endured assaults and murder by incoming white settlers who desired 
native lands. Jackson knew her topic was politically sensitive, so she disguised 
it in romance: the half-Indian Ramona is raised by an adoptive mother on 
an opulent rancho where California's beneficent climate creates bloom and 
abundance. Ramona falls in love and elopes with the son of an Indian Chief; 
in her new life she endures all the suffering of her people: white invaders 
steal their lands and her husband is murdered before Ramona's eyes— 
real-life incidents Jackson took from her research and applied to the life of 
her fictional character. 
The novel was a tremendous success, but it failed to draw attention to 
native issues, gaining attention instead for its romance and lavish landscapes. 
Jackson's was the first novel written about southern California, so when a 
tremendous tourism-and-real-estate boom began there in 1885, thousands 
of tourists prepared for their travels by read-
ing Ramona. Soon clever boosters were sell-
ing Ramona-related souvenirs and developing 
Ramona-related tourist attractions: by 1925 
there were two ranchos that were known as 
the "Home of Ramona," as well as sites called 
"Ramona's Marriage Place,"  "Ramona's Birth-
place" and even "Ramona's grave." Southern 
California's past and present landscapes were 
being understood through the lens of fiction  
(Figure 5.B).
Scholars scoffed at Ramona tourists who 
seemed to have confused fact with fiction, and 
been so easily relieved of their cash for crass 
curios like  Ramona salt-and-pepper shakers, 
Ramona letter openers, Ramona postcards, and 
Ramona souvenir teaspoons (Figure 5.C). Both 
the tourists and the things they bought were dis-
missed as insignificant in the shaping of southern 
California's Ramona-inspired landscapes.

and the practices of tourists at those locales 
have to be understood in tandem;  together 
 representations and practices reveal the 
complex webs of  fiction and fact from which 
we construct our realities. 
1.  Look around you both at home and in 
stores. What souvenirs do you find? 
What do they remind you of? What 
geographies—of landscapes, emotions, 
peoples, and travels—do these mate-
rial objects recall for you or for their 
collectors? 
2.  How else do we connect fact and 
fiction in our daily lives? Think of an 
example of something significant and 
influential that is nevertheless not re-
ally "real." How does this connection 
between fact and fiction influence you? 
Does it shape what you wear or eat, 
desire or disdain, aspire to become? 
Whatever its influence, consider also 
how it influences the landscapes, fact of 
fiction that are part of your life.
(visiting Ramona-related places) really so insignificant? Tourists and 
souvenirs are difficult to study because of their rapid geographical 
dispersion: the tourists return home, and the souvenirs are brought 
home or gifted elsewhere. So geographers have observed and in-
terviewed tourists at tourist sites, and then followed them and their 
purchased souvenirs back home to understand what these objects 
mean in their new contexts. What they have learned is that these 
objects serve as reminders of places visited, stories and histories 
engaged there, and personal experiences shared there. Each souve-
nir serves to link people, through travel, to places and understand-
ings of those places, in personally meaningful ways, creating what 
cultural geographers call "intimate spatialities of social memory"— 
personal geographies of connection to place and history. 
We may sneer or smile at this proliferation of souvenirs. But their 
existence, and the details of their materiality is revealing for cultural 
geographers. Tourists used their souvenirs to connect themselves 
and their travels to southern California and the story of Ramona—
like one woman who visited Ramona's Marriage Place on her hon-
eymoon and wrote on a postcard: "In this building is the chapel and 
altar where Ramona married  Allessandro [sic]," and, noting that a 
wishing well was full of coins, wrote, "I made wish too! But I won't 
tell—." Her hopes for her future became entwined with the fictional 
story of Ramona and the factual landscapes of southern  California. Because 
postcards, when mailed are also cancelled and dated, careful  research 
 reveals that, in the case of every Ramona-related tourist attraction, the tour-
ists came first, before the boosters. It was the tourists who shaped southern 
 California's Ramona landscapes. And today's tourists may be shaping land-
scapes in New Zealand and Britain, where landscapes of fiction, souvenirs,

Returning to our chopstick example, when combined with the 
cultural complex of food, holidays, family and related prac-
tices and undertaken in China, they demonstrate how a cul-
tural system is at work, though its specific manifestations vary 
by the cultural region in which they are occurring.

1. What can we learn by studying cultural traits? How does looking 
at cultural complexes help us better understand the relationship 
between humans and the spaces in which they live?
2. Identify two traits that are characteristic of the cultural group to 
which you belong. Are the traits related to the country or region 
in which you live? Describe the relationship or explain why there is 
none.
CULTURAL SYSTEMS
Broader than the cultural complex concept is the cultural 
system, a collection of interacting components that, taken 
together, shape a group's collective identity. A cultural system 
includes traits, territorial affiliation, and shared history, as well 
as other, more complex elements, such as language and reli-
gion. In a cultural system, it is possible for internal variations 
to exist in particular elements at the same time that broader 
similarities lend coherence. The phrase, "American culture" 
is a reference to the concept of a cultural system. This system 
includes shared territory and history, a standardized education 
and a shared language (or more precisely a national language) 
as well as other cultural elements such as a predominant form 
of family organization, political norms like the two-party sys-
tem, and even attachment to certain national sports activi-
ties or even television shows. Of course, not everyone in the 
United States actually has the same history nor do all Ameri-
cans speak the national language of English or enjoy baseball 
or live as a nuclear family (Figure 5.11). The point is that cul-
tural systems are about broad similarities at the national level 
and more particular geographic variation at the regional and 
local level where the local level may refer to a 
city, a neighborhood or even a household.
Culture and Society
Through its influence on social organization, 
culture has an important impact. Social catego-
ries like kinship, gang, or generation, or some 
combination of categories, can figure more 
or less prominently, depending upon geog-
raphy. Moreover, the salience of these social 
categories may change over time as the group 
interacts with people and forces outside of its 
boundaries.
For example, countries in the Middle East 
and North Africa are as culturally dynamic as 
any other region of the globe. Their society 
is shaped by cultural ties and meaning sys-
tems that highlight gender, tribe, nationality, 
discontinuous in its extension, it is the area within which a 
particular cultural system prevails. A cultural region is an 
area where certain cultural practices, beliefs, or values are 
more or less practiced by the majority of the inhabitants. Cul-
tural regions should be seen as key parts of a cultural complex 
and not simply the setting where cultural complexes occur.

young women who are turning 20, participate in dances and a citywide celebra-
tion that is meant to remind them of the responsibilities they face as adults. In 
South Korea, people who turn 60 are also ritually celebrated. Called hwan-gap, 
this celebration is significant because it marks the day on which an individual 
has completed a full zodiacal cycle. But, more importantly, it is also celebrated, 
because to live to be 60 is seen as a great accomplishment. In the past, most 
people in South Korea died before their 60th birthday.

relations are understood by social groups to be exclusively 
based on biological or marriage ties. While biological ties, usu-
ally determined through the father, are important in the Middle 
East, they are not the only important ties that link individuals 
and families.
Kinship is such a valued relationship for expressing soli-
darity and connection that it is often used to assert a feeling 
of group closeness and as a basis for identity even where no 
"natural" or "blood" ties are present. This notion of kinship 
might also be seen in America among fraternity "brothers," 
sorority "sisters," gang members, and even police officers and 
firefighters who feel a strong familial bond with co-workers. In 
the Middle East and North Africa, kinship is even an impor-
tant factor in shaping the spatial relationships of the home, as 
kinship, and family. Global media technologies, such as sat-
ellite television and the Internet, are increasingly penetrat-
ing the region, however, and the potential for new social 
forms to emerge and old ones to be reconfigured is increas-
ing. Although the predominant forms of social organization 
in the region have persisted for hundreds of years, it would 
be incorrect to assume that both subtle and dramatic changes 
within these forms have not already occurred.
Kinship is a form of social organization that is particu-
larly central to the culture system of the Middle East and North 
Africa. Kinship is normally thought of as a relationship based 
on blood, marriage, or adoption. This definition needs to be 
expanded, however, to include a shared notion of relationship 
among members of a group. The point is that not all kinship

CULTURE AND IDENTITY
In addition to exploring cultural forms, such as religion and 
language, and movements, such as cultural nationalism—the 
belief that a nation shares a common culture—geographers 
have increasingly begun to ask questions about other forms of 
identity. This interest largely has to do with certain long-estab-
lished and some more recently self-conscious cultural groups 
that are beginning to use their identities to assert political, eco-
nomic, social, and cultural claims.
Sex and Gender
In standard dictionaries of the English language 
sex is consistently defined as the biological and 
physiological characteristics that differenti-
ate males and females at birth, based on bodily 
characteristics such as anatomy, chromosomes, 
and hormones. Gender in the same reference 
books is a term that is meant to differentiate 
biology from the social and cultural distinction 
between the sexes. Sex as a category is meant to 
specify man and woman, whereas gender cate-
gories would more appropriately be masculine 
and feminine.
This current distinction between sex and 
gender has been criticized as misleading, how-
ever, by both social and biological scientists. 
The reason for this is that it implies that the 
behavior of an individual can be separated out 
into being shaped by either biological or cultural 
factors. The critics would respond that biologi-
cal manifestations of sex are crosscut with psy-
chosocial and cultural variables so much so that 
there is no way to determine that the differences 
between males and females are due exclusively 
to biology or to culture (Figure 5.13).
well as outside the home, determining who can interact with 
whom and under what circumstances. This is especially the 
case in the interaction of gender and kinship, where wom-
en's and men's access to public and private space is sharply 
differentiated.
The idea of the tribe is also central to understanding 
the sociopolitical organization of the Middle East and North 
Africa, as well as other regions of the world. Although trib-
ally organized populations appear throughout the region, the 
tribe is not a widespread form of social organization. Generally 
speaking, a tribe is a form of social identity created by groups 
who share a set of ideas about collective loyalty and political 
action (Figure 5.12). The term tribe is a highly contested con-
cept and one that should be treated carefully. For instance, it is 
often seen as a negative label applied by colonizers to suggest 
a primitive social organization throughout Africa. Where it is 
adopted in the Middle East and North Africa, however, tribe is 
seen as a valuable element in sustaining modern national iden-
tity. Tribes are grounded in one or more expressions of social, 
political, and cultural identities created by individuals who 
share those identities. The result is the formation of collective 
loyalties that result in primary allegiance to the tribe.

CHAPTER 5   Cultural Geographies   193
Research on the gendered body in geography recognizes 
that space is central to its understanding. For instance, where 
transgendered identities can be performed plays a central role 
in who occupies those spaces, how they are occupied, and even 
what gender identity people might be perform-
ing if they occupy one space and not another. 
But issues of gender and space go beyond the 
performance of identity to the emergence of new 
political cultures that are being constructed to 
protect the rights of people who don't identify as 
simple male or female in particular national and 
international spaces.
Our approach in this book is understanding that sex and 
gender operate along three lines:
■ Sex and gender are not categories that should be sepa-
rated—they very clearly shape each other—because they 
are deeply connected categories of being.
■ There are a multitude of sexes in between the two extremes 
of male and female and one's sex need not align with one's 
biology.
■ Gender is most effectively understood as a socially con-
structed performance that uses codes of femininity and 
masculinity to operate in the world.
We turn next to gender identity, relinquishing our focus 
on sex. Our reason for this is that in both scholarship and in 
popular treatments, the term gender has come to be used as 
the preferred term for the complex relationship between sex 
and gender. Because of that, we discuss gender in its multifac-
eted and sometimes confusing aspects as well as its relevance 
to geographic concerns.
Gender Identity As illustrated in the chapter opener, gen-
der is an identity that has captured the attention not only of 
cultural geographers but is widely recognized in popular cul-
ture as well. Indeed, gender identity is so widely acknowl-
edged in everyday life that in 2013, Facebook added more than 
50 custom categories to their gender option. Facebook, recog-
nizing that the simple male/female dichotomy was inadequate 
in capturing the multiplicity of genders that reside in the space 
between them, took the rather radical step of opening up the 
category to 58 options.
This move by Facebook is a fundamental recognition that is 
a key feature of all human identity marking and defining humans 
as "sexed" beings. It is also an acknowledgment that gender is 
not something people essentially are (because of a given set of 
physical characteristics), but something people do (something 
we enact by the way we present our bodily selves to the world) 
and something we understand ourselves to be (Figure 5.14).

Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Maldives and Bangladesh—is intensely 
patriarchal, though the form that patriarchy takes varies by 
region and class. The common denominator among the poor 
throughout South Asia is that women not only have the con-
stant responsibilities of motherhood and domestic chores but 
also have to work long hours in informal-sector occupations. 
In many poor communities, 90 percent of all production occurs 
outside of formal employment, more than half of which is the 
result of women's efforts. In addition,  women's property rights 
are curtailed, their public behavior is restricted, and their oppor-
tunities for education and participation in the waged labor force 
are severely limited.
The picture for women in South Asia, the Middle East, 
and elsewhere is not entirely negative, however, and one of the 
most significant developments has been the increasing educa-
tion of girls. Because women's education is so closely linked 
to improvements in economic development, more and more 
countries are investing in their education. As more and more 
women become educated, they have fewer children and greater 
levels of economic independence and political empowerment.
Ethnicity
Ethnicity is another area in which geographers explore cul-
tural identity. Ethnicity is a socially created system of rules 
about who belongs to a particular group based upon actual or 
perceived commonalities, such as language or religion. A geo-
graphic focus on ethnicity is an attempt to understand how 
it shapes and is shaped by space and how ethnic groups use 
space with respect to mainstream culture as well as other eth-
nic groups. For cultural geographers, territory is also a basis for 
ethnic group cohesion (see Chapter 10 for more on territory). 
For example, cultural groups—ethnically identified or other-
wise—may be spatially segregated from the wider society in 
ghettos, ethnic enclaves, homelands, and tribal areas.
Feminism and Gender
Whereas the previous section on gender has focused on gender 
as a sexual identity that extends far beyond the simple binary 
or male or female, gender has also been a category that femi-
nist geographers and others have used to understand inequal-
ity between men and women. Much has been written about 
this uneven relationship. As used by feminists, gender implies 
a socially created difference in power between males and 
females that gives an advantage to the former over the latter 
and is not biologically determined but socially and culturally 
created (Box 5.2 Spatial Inequality: The Global Gender Gap). 
Gender interacts with other forms of identity and can intensify 
power differences among and between groups.
APPLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE
1. What do you think about the UN statement that, "No society treat 
its women as well as its men"? Why do you think that is? How do 
you think that can change?
2. Identify the bases of identity in your country. Mention the identi-
ties that may have emerged recently. Give reasons why you think 
these have emerged. In your opinion, are identities multiple and 
dynamic?
Feminists use the word intersectionality to characterize 
what happens when other identities such as race, class, age, or 
ability also have an effect on power dynamics.  Intersectionality 
is a recognition of the ways that different forms or systems of 
oppression, domination, or discrimination overlap. Black 
feminism advanced the original example of intersectionality 
by arguing that being black and female are inseparable identi-
ties that intersect and reinforce each other. Geographers have 
found the concept of intersectionality convincing but add that 
intersecting forms of oppression are played out differently in 
different parts of the world.
For example, although gender differences play an important 
part in shaping social life for men and women in the Middle East, 
as elsewhere around the globe, there is no single Islamic, Chris-
tian, or Jewish notion of gender that operates exclusively in the 
region. Many in the West have formed stereo-
types about the restricted lives of Middle Eastern 
women because of the operation of rigid Islamic 
traditions (Figure 5.15). It is important to under-
stand, however, that these do not capture the 
great variety in gender relations that exists in the 
Middle East and North Africa across lines of class, 
generation, level of education, and geography 
(urban versus rural origins), among other factors.
Gender and Class
In South Asia, gender is greatly complicated by 
class such that among the poor, women bear the 
greatest social and economic burden and the 
most suffering. Generally speaking, South Asian 
society—India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nepal,

In 1990, the United Nations published the first of its annual Human Devel-
opment Reports. The report analyzes how economic growth and human 
development are inextricably tied and provides statistics about changes in 
both over time as well as suggestions for how to improve them  (Figure 5.D). 
Since 1990, the report has taken the position that women are at a struc-
tural disadvantage compared to men and in its 1997 report, stated baldly, 
"No society treats its women as well as its men." While the differences be-
tween women's and men's pay in the developed world is a common topic 
of discussion and concern (where in the United States for every $1 men 
earn, women earn 77 cents), in the developing world, women experience 
deep deprivation, exploitation, and harm. The following are ten examples of 
gender inequality globally.3
5.3 Spatial Inequality 
The Global Gender Gap
1. Women everywhere experience a gender wage gap whether in 
the developed or the developing world.
 
2. Women in many parts of the world experience limited mobility 
from not being allowed to drive on public roads to refusing to go 
out by themselves at night for fear of attack or rape.
 
3. One in every three women around the world is likely to be 
beaten, coerced into sex, or otherwise abused sometime in her 
lifetime.
 
4. In some countries, a male child is more valuable than a female 
child and parents who don't want a girl may either abort the fetus 
or kill the child after birth.
   5.  In some countries, women are 
legally prohibited from owning 
land.
   6.  According to the United Nations, 
women do two-thirds of the 
world's work, receive ten percent 
of the world's income and own 
one percent of the means of eco-
nomic production.
   7.  Women have more limited access 
to health care than men while one 
women dies in childbirth every 
minute of every day.
   8.  Forced marriages and the lack of 
legal access to divorce limits many 
women's life chances.

global population, women hold 
only 15.6 percent of elected 
seats in national parliaments or 
congresses.

two-thirds of the world's illiterate 
adults.

control over their territory to practice self-governance 
and to follow their own cultural traditions and not 
those of the mainstream (Han-dominated) society. The 
Uyghur ethnic identity is fragmented, however. Some 
Uyghur support a pan-Islamic vision, exemplified in 
the East Turkestan Islamic Movement; others support 
a pan-Turkic vision, as in the East Turkestan Liberation 
Organization; and a third group—the East Turkestan 
independence movement— promotes a "Uyghurstan" 
state. As a result, Uyghurs do not speak with one voice 
and members of each of these groups have committed 
violence against other Uyghurs whom they view as too 
assimilated to Chinese or Russian society or not reli-
gious enough  (Figure 5.16).
The term ethnicity comes from the Greek eth-
nos, which in classical times was understood as "the 
people." But as time passed and the term migrated, 
its meaning changed so that in England, from the 
fifteenth until the mid-nineteenth century, ethnic 
came to mean, heathen, foreign or pagan. In the nine-
teenth century United States, which was experienc-
ing massive immigration then, ethnicity came to 
mean a racial, cultural, or national minority group 
and served as a replacement for the term race, which was thor-
oughly emotionally charged through its attachment to slavery, 
outlawed in 1865 by the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. 
Constitution.
In its contemporary usage, ethnicity is widely understood 
as a cultural category constituted through shared history and 
often through language, religion, and an attachment to a par-
ticular place or homeland (Figure 5.17). And though there are 
many examples of ethnic groups who share a cohesive sense 
of community and belonging, not all do. As with any identity, 
variation exists in practice.

sex and gender, and ethnicity. Are there other categories that you 
think are critical in assessing cultural identity?
2.  One indicator of ethnicity and territory is 
the geographic distribution of places of wor-
ship across an urban area. Churches, temples, 
mosques, meeting houses, and chapels are 
usually located close to the communities they

of whiteness and the spaces that enable it that we can truly 
begin to undo racist practices.
Whiteness, Blackness, and Rap Music
To appreciate the complexity of the relationship between white-
ness and blackness in the United States two examples provide 
insight: one is about space and race in the form of racial deseg-
regation and the other is about blackness as an object of white 
fascination and appropriation. Consider these two facts: the 
racial integration of public K-12 schools in the United States, 
successfully achieved within a decade of court-mandated inte-
gration in the 1960s and 1970s, is increasingly being dismantled 
so that now many schools, all over the country but especially in 
the South, are as segregated as they were in the 1950s. Contrast 
the deterioration of racial integration with the second fact of the 
huge popularity of black rap music among white audiences who 
are the largest consumers of recordings by black rap artists. At 
the same time that white teenagers appropriate rap music, they 
also demonstrate their fascination with African American cul-
ture through the outfits they wear and the language—both verbal 
and nonverbal—they adopt. And yet, they are highly unlikely 
to attend high school with more than a handful of black youth. 
How can these two contrary phenomena—"blackophobia" 
or fear of blacks by whites and "blackophilia" or adulation of 
blacks by whites—exist simultaneously in the United States?
Cultural theorists contend that these two seemingly contra-
dictory facts can only be understood in relation to each other. 
They assert that the tendency to embrace black culture by con-
suming rap and other African American artifacts is related to 
the destabilization of what it means to be white in U.S. society 
today as the country moves from majority white, to no racial 
majority, thus decentering whiteness in the process. So just 
as white youth are embracing black culture and appropriating 
it for their own use, they (and their parents who make deci-
sions about where to send them to high school) are refusing to 
physical characteristics. Racialization is the practice of cre-
ating unequal castes based on the norm of whiteness. Bio-
logically speaking, no such thing as race exists within the 
human species. Yet consider the categories of race and place 
that correspond to "African American" and "ghetto." Power-
ful Western ideas about race have enabled the emergence and 
perpetuation of segregated spaces in many North American 
cities and elsewhere. In this and other cases, the visible char-
acteristics of hair, skin, and bone structure made race into a 
category of difference that was (and still is) widely accepted 
and often spatially expressed.
The mainstream approach views neighborhood as a spatial 
setting for systems of affiliation more or less chosen by people 
with similar skin color. Cultural geographers have overturned 
this approach to see neighborhoods as spaces that affirm the 
dominant society's sense of identity. Place continues to be a 
mechanism for creating and preserving local systems of racial 
classification and for containing geographical difference within 
defined geographical confines. The homelands of South Africa 
and the dismantling of apartheid there also illustrate the inter-
action of race and place on a much larger scale.
Unexamined in the kinds of perceptions and practices 
that create racialized places as different as Arab Street in Sin-
gapore and the homelands of South Africa is the taken-for-
granted notion of whiteness. Whiteness is seen to be the norm 
or the standard against which all other visible differences are 
compared. But whiteness, as geographers and other scholars 
have shown, is itself a category of difference that depends on 
visible distinctions, not biological ones, and is always con-
structed in relation to other categories (Figure 5.18). Recently, 
researchers in the humanities and social sciences have begun 
to "denaturalize" whiteness by investigating the ways white-
ness has been constructed as a social category in different 
periods and places as well as the ways whiteness operates in 
particular sites such as classrooms, on the street, and in board-
rooms. It is only when we begin to challenge the naturalness

operate in and through geography in particular ways. The study 
of children by cultural geographers focuses on how  children 
understand the world around them and how they negotiate 
it. It also explores how adult-centered accounts and experi-
ences of the world exclude the different and equally complex 
experiences and accounts of children.
Geographers' recognition that children experience oppres-
sion and deprivation in ways that are different from adults is a 
reflection of the fact that in the United States, 22% of all chil-
dren live in families with incomes below the poverty level. In 
this situation, the effects of poverty on children mean that their 
ability to learn is affected and social, emotional, and behav-
ioral problems are a result. The effects of poverty on adults, all 
though no less profound, are not the same.
Geographies of childhood are distinct from children's 
geographies in that the former reflect an interest by researchers  
support policies or practices that challenge the foundations of 
their white privilege.4 White privilege—advantages that accrue 
to white people beyond what is commonly experienced by 
people of color—and white supremacy—the belief that white 
people are superior to other races—sit at the heart of the racist 
practices described here.
Race is a highly complicated category of difference and its 
expression in daily life varies from place to place. Geographers 
probe the foundations of these spatial differences.
Geographies of Disability
While it might seem that disability is a far reach from racism, 
it's not. The kind of discrimination that people with disabili-
ties face is premised on a similar belief that the able-bodied 
are "normal" and superior to the disabled who possess a lesser 
social status. Disability is a physical or mental condition that 
limits a person's movements, senses, or activities. Disability—
both in its physical and mental form—has begun to be studied 
fairly widely by geographers who are particularly interested in 
the way that disabled people encounter the spaces in which 
they must conduct their daily lives. Studies that examine how 
the built environment can "dis-able" people are common, their 
goal being to provide research to shape public policies that 
address these disabling arrangements.
Besides studying the ways that the environment creates 
barriers for persons with disability, other work by geographers 
explores the ways persons with disabilities experience space, 
what their perceptions of the environment are, and how they 
create communities and form identities (Figure 5.19). The for-
mation of a common cause and identity has been critical to the 
political movements that persons with disabilities have formed, 
demanding recognition of their human right to an accessible and 
safe environment in which to live and work. One success from 
this activism has been the United Nations Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities. A key tenet of the conven-
tion is, "Reaffirming the universality, indivisibility, interdepen-
dence and interrelatedness of all human rights and fundamental 
freedoms and the need for persons with disabilities to be guar-
anteed their full enjoyment without discrimination."5
Children's Geographies and Geographies 
of Childhood
Another focus of cultural geography is the spaces and places 
of the lives of youth and children, known as children's geog-
raphies. In addition to recognizing that attunement to culture 
means recognizing differences in race, gender, sexuality and 
ethnicity, it also means appreciating that children—includ-
ing teenagers, youth, and other individuals—who are largely 
dependent on adults for their health, welfare, and safety also

CHAPTER 5   Cultural Geographies   199
Actor-Network Theory
Perhaps the most important influence on cultural 
geography in the twenty-first century has been 
actor-network  theory (ANT), which is actually 
less of a theory and more of an orientation. Actor-
network theory views the world as composed of 
"heterogeneous things," including humans and 
nonhumans and objects.
What makes ANT so interesting is that the 
approach attributes to nonhumans and objects 
as much force in the composition of social life as 
humans have. Rather than elevating humans as the 
superior species that determines all social practice 
and action, ANT recognizes that humans coexist with 
nonhumans (who may be other living species or inert 
objects) in a network that includes all sorts of social 
and material bits and pieces. Things are just as impor-
tant to social life as are humans in an actor network.
An example of an actor network is a family. According 
to ANT, a family is both a network and an actor that hangs 
together and for certain purposes acts as a single entity. A 
family is connected through all sorts of objects: cell phones, 
houses, automobiles, family dinners, the family pet, and so on. 
Nonhumans help constitute the fabric of "family" and enable 
it to persist, though its contours are always changing. It is not 
only the humans who make the family what it is, it is also the 
nonhumans that help the assemblage to come together as a 
recognizable and coherent entity. Agency—the ability to make 
things happen—resides not only in the human members of the 
assemblage but also in the nonhuman (the house, the dog, the 
barbeque grill, the flat-screen television) (Figure 5.21).
Recall through  Figure 5.3, how the Internet of things is shap-
ing wake up time, when the coffee gets made, when the car gets 
started, the time of departure for the train station, and so on. The 
point of ANT is not that all these things are connected so much 
that humans are not solitary agents in the world but rather that 
human behaviors need to be understood as shaped and often 
driven by objects. The Internet of things is an actor-network 
where all sort of objects and nonhuman others come together to 
shape how we operate in the world on a very basic level.
Consider the cell phone as an example. This mobile device 
connects people to family and friends, nearly instantaneously 
and certainly in ways that a landline never could. The material-
ity of that object—its "thingness"—is not inert; it has an active 
forcefulness that can produce significant outcomes such that 
we are often at a loss without them or especially empowered 
with them. In a way, cell phones have become objects that make 
us do things we might not or could not otherwise.
Non-Representational Theory
One of the criticisms of ANT has been that it treats humans as 
undifferentiated and lacking in affect and emotion as they go 
about the business of social life. In attempting to go further into 
what it means to be human and particularly into what is pres-
ent in human experience, cultural geographers have become 
increasingly interested in non-representational theory. In brief, 
in how childhood as a stage of life is conceived. Researchers 
recognize that childhood is not a natural category of the life 
cycle but one that has been "invented" by society. They also 
insist upon the need to appreciate children as possessing the 
capacity to act and think autonomously and to affect and inter-
act with the world around them in unique ways (Figure 5.20). 
For example, geographers have explored how economic pro-
cesses such as deindustrialization affect children through the 
kinds of futures they imagine for themselves.

about a concept of "normal"?)

in your everyday life—where different groups are simultaneously 
vilified and fetishized? How does this cultural schizophrenia con-

EMERGENT CULTURAL 
GEOGRAPHIES
Since the arrival of the new century, cultural geography has 
experienced, again, a transformation in the way its practitio-
ners think about the relationship between people and their 
worlds. These new ways of conceptualizing culture and space 
are still developing but they hold the promise of opening up 
a wide range of previously ignored aspects of daily life to 
advance our attempts at explanation.

Others have described how hearing their national anthem 
produces an almost indescribable feeling, even when a per-
son does not consider him or herself patriotic or is uncom-
fortable in general with displays of nationalism (Figure 5.22). 
And yet, many of these same people also describe a kind 
of sudden "shivery feeling" that involuntarily occurs when 
the music begins and the whole stadium stands in respect 
and recognition of being a part of something larger than the 
individual.
NRT is keenly interested in events in which things sud-
denly shift and something involuntary occurs. And it is par-
ticularly interested in events when whole groups experience 
something not anticipated in advance. These are moments that 
hold significant political potential. For example, in Tunisia in 
the spring of 2011, the self-immolation of a fruit seller ignited a 
city's anger at their political dispossession, launching a politi-
cal event that spread across the Middle East.
Emotional Geographies
In addition to an interest in affect and NRT, geographers also 
explore emotion. Those who study emotion differentiate it from 
affect by specifying that emotion is personal feeling based on 
one's biography or a social context. Emotion is a response to 
an internal state of being. Affect by contrast is a nonconscious 
experience of intensity; it is always outside of conscious aware-
ness. Facial expressions or tone of voice, for instance, have the 
capacity to transmit affect. Once transmitted, emotions register 
the ways our bodies and our minds react to those expressions. 
We may become excited or afraid as we process the intensity of 
those expressions. Our emotional response depends on who we 
are and what our social conditioning has been.7
non-representational theory (NRT) understands human life as 
a process that is always unfolding, always becoming something 
different, even if only slightly so. It recognizes that much of this 
becoming occurs outside of conscious thought. Because much 
of human existence is precognitive (decisions are made before 
the conscious self is aware of them), NRT is interested in those 
moments of indeterminacy when events emerge that produce 
new orderings that may persist or give way to older, more settled 
ones. These are moments we have all experienced, when some-
thing happens that no one expected and yet in which everyone 
participated in enabling the new ordering to emerge. This focus 
on indeterminacy means that NRT's task is a difficult one in that 
it attempts to attend to things that words (as representations) can-
not express.
Geographer Ben Anderson has used non-representational 
theory to explore memory and music. His work is concerned 
with how the process of listening to music produces both 
remembering and forgetting within the context of ordinary liv-
ing. He describes a young woman (whom he interviewed) lis-
tening to music as background to her getting ready for work. 
As she sits flipping through a magazine and eating breakfast 
with a Frank Sinatra tune playing in the background, she sud-
denly hears her mother (who died several years before) singing 
along to the music. It's a moment from her past; her mother 
would frequently sing along to all music, and this song was 
one of her favorites. And in that moment, the young woman is 
transported from her apartment back in space and time to her 
family home. The woman notes that when this happened she 
got "shivery feelings really suddenly."6 Anderson identifies 
that "shivery feeling" as affect—emotions that are embodied 
reactions to the social and physical environment. Affect is also 
about the power of these emotions to result in or enable action.

CHAPTER 5   Cultural Geographies   201
Geographers are particularly interested in how emotions 
are tied to places. How different environments, for instance, 
produce different emotional responses. Because emotions are a 
central component of being human they possess the potential to 
both shape and be shaped by geography. In addition, emotions 
can both emerge from as well as produce spatial orders and thus 
geographers are interested in understanding how emotions are 
part of the various elements that make up what it's like to live 
in a place or visit or operate in a particular space (Figure 5.23).
Materialism
Both ANT and non-representational theory share an interest 
in matter and materiality. Materialism emphasizes that the 
material world—its objects and nonhuman entities—is at least 
partly separate from humans and possesses the power to affect 
humans. A materialist approach is about attempting to under-
stand the ways that specific properties of material things affect 
the interactions between humans and nonhuman entities. 
What materialism adds to NRT and ANT is a commitment to 
understanding the material world as it unfolds in unpredict-
able ways. Both theories point to real physical and mental enti-
ties as significant to our attempts to explain the world. And 
they both recognize that humans are not separate from or in 
any way superior to the world of things. The aim of these new 
ways of thinking about cultural geography is to rethink how 
material objects work in the world so that they come to be seen 
as "lively"—having real force and intensity in the world.
When seen in terms of cultural geography, the materialism 
that is at the center of these new ways of thinking directs our

different from one another. Airports, offices, and international 
hotels have become notoriously alike, and their similarities 
of architecture and interior design have become reinforced 
by the near-universal dress codes of the people who frequent 
them. For example, the business suit, especially for males, 
has become the norm for office workers throughout much of 
the world. Jeans, T-shirts, and cell phones, meanwhile, have 
become the norm for young people, as well as those in lower-
wage jobs.
Americanization and Globalization
It is these commonalities—as well as others, such as the same 
automobiles, television shows, popular music, food, and global 
brands like McDonalds, Coca-Cola, and Apple—that provide a 
sense of familiarity to core travelers abroad. From the point of 
view of cultural nationalism, the "lowest common denomina-
tor" of this familiarity is often seen as the culture of fast food and 
popular entertainment that emanates from the United States. 
Popular commentators have observed that cultures around the 
world are being Americanized (see Chapter 2). This process rep-
resents the beginnings of a single global culture based on mate-
rial consumption, with the English language as its medium.
There is certainly some evidence to support this point 
of view, not least in the sheer numbers of people around the 
world who view American Idol, drink Coca-Cola, and eat in 
McDonald's franchises or similar fast-food chains. Largely 
through consumer goods, U.S. culture is increasingly embraced 
by local entrepreneurs around the world. It seems clear that 
U.S. products are consumed as much for their symbolism of a 
particular way of life as for their intrinsic value. McDonald's 
burgers, along with Coca-Cola, Hollywood movies, rock music, 
and NFL and NBA insignia, have become associated with a 
lifestyle package that features luxury, youth, fitness, beauty, 
and freedom.
It is important to recognize, however, that U.S. products 
often undergo changes when they travel across the globe. For 
instance, L'Oreal, a Paris-based international corporation and 
the leading mass-market producer of cosmetics, skin- and hair-
care products, and fragrances, is very aware of the need to vary 
its products for their consumption in non-French markets. Its 
website provides insight into the wide variety of skin types, 
hair types, and treatment preferences across the world. For 
instance, one of their pages is devoted to understanding "When 
the Diversity of Types of Beauty Inspires Science," thus link-
ing their research aims with a sense that beauty is a category 
that varies throughout the world. On a linked page entitled 
"Expert in Skin and Hair Types Around the World" is a color 
chart displaying 66 skin tones called "A New Geography of 
Skin Color." L'Oreal believes this mapping of skin color allows 
the company to adapt their cosmetics to the expectations of 
different national consumers. Box 5.4, Window on the World:  
Geographies of Plastic Surgery, provides a con-
trast to L'Oreal's aim to cater to differences in 
cultural norms of beauty by showing how the 
increasing popularity of plastic surgery around 
the world appears to be premised on narrow, 
largely Western notions of beauty.
attention to how cultural beliefs and values gain permanence 
and power through material form. Buildings, symbols, com-
modities, or rituals—the twin towers of the World Trade 
Center, a military uniform, a diamond ring, a Thanksgiving 
meal—shape us and affect the way we are recognized by oth-
ers (Figure 5.24).

Yet neither the widespread consumption of U.S. and U.S.-
style products nor the increasing familiarity of people around the 
world with global media and international brand names adds up 
to the emergence of a single global culture. Rather, what is hap-
pening is that processes of globalization are exposing the world's 
inhabitants to a common set of products, symbols, myths, memo-
ries, events, cult figures, landscapes, and traditions. People living 
in Tokyo or Tucson, Turin or Timbuktu, may be perfectly familiar 
with these commonalities without necessarily using or respond-
ing to them in uniform ways. It is also important to recognize that 
cultural flows take place in all directions, not just outward from 
the United States. Think, for example, of European fashions in 
U.S. stores; of Chinese, Indian, Italian, Mexican, and Thai restau-
rants in U.S. towns and cities; and of U.S. and European stores 
selling exotic craft goods from the periphery.
A Global Culture?
The answer to the question of whether there is a global cul-
ture must therefore be "no," or at least there is no indisputable 
sign of it yet. While people around the world share an increas-
ing familiarity with a common set of products, symbols, and 
events (many of which originate in the U.S. culture of fast food 
and popular entertainment), these commonalties are config-
ured in different ways in different places, rather than constitut-
ing a single global culture. The local interacts with the global, 
often producing hybrid cultures. Sometimes traditional local 
cultures become the subject of global consumption; sometimes 
it is the other way around.

to different places of the world—become more Westernized? 
What do you think might be lost as a result of a "global standard of

2. What is the relationship between "beauty" and "power"? Do an 
Internet search on ideals of beauty in different cultures, and com-
pare those images to global beauty products and fashion. What 
are some of the links among physical beauty, consumption, and 
social power? For example, why is a Louis Vuitton bag a symbol 
of status not just in France, but also in Mexico, Dubai, Algeria, and 
Japan? Think about how "looking rich" or "looking white" creates a 
niche market and influences social power.
The same might be said of other cultural products emanat-
ing from the U.S. entertainment industry. Today the entertain-
ment industry is the leading source of foreign income in the 
United States, with a trade surplus of over $25 billion. The 
originals of over half of all the books translated in the world 
(more than 25,000 titles) are written in English, the majority 
of which are produced by U.S. publishers. In terms of interna-
tional flows of everything from mail and phone calls to press-
agency reports, television programs, radio shows, and movies, 
a disproportionately large share originates in the United States. 
What this huge export of U.S. entertainment products suggests 
is that the market is being saturated by U.S. cultural norms to 
the disadvantage of local ones (Figure 5.25).

HUMAN GEOGRAPHY   Places and Regions in Global Context
5.4 Window on the World
The phrase, "beauty is in the eye of the beholder" has been credited to 
a range of individuals from Plato to Hume. This is no doubt because the  
sentiment is one that has been repeated down through the ages: beauty is 
subjective, so the assessment of what is beautiful is up to the observer. But  
it's also possible to contend that beauty is in geography, in the cultural ide-
als of beauty that vary across the globe. For instance, in Mauritania, a large 
woman is considered beautiful among some urban groups (Figure 5.E). 
Mauritania is a country that routinely experiences famine and a stout woman, 
especially a wife, signals social standing and wealth in this context. Full- 
figured women are also highly prized in Fiji. Though the country is not prone 
to drought, social life there revolves around family and eating. There lavish 
meals are a cultural artifact of the uncertainly that is central to a traditional 
subsistence-based economy where an extended spell of rains, for example, 
can eliminate a season's harvest.
In India, light skin is another signal of the relationship between beauty 
and wealth for both men and women (Figure 5.F). In a country that strad-
dles the equator where the sun is constant and human skin is subject to harsh 
exposure and darkening, it is a sign of wealth to be able to stay indoors and 
avoid any kind of work that requires constant exposure to the sun. And in 
many Muslim countries, where women cover their hair or both their hair and 
bodies, the eyes become the focus of the female face and are said to be the 
source of a woman's beauty. Numerous other examples could be offered 
but the point is that for a very long time, these cultural standards of beauty 
have persisted. And yet, globalization and the circulation of beauty norms 
from the West are starting to displace these local norms with dangerous con-
sequences in some cases.
One example of this is illustrated in Figure 5.G that documents the 
rise in plastic surgery globally. Surgical alteration is one way to achieve the 
beauty norms that are otherwise impossible to achieve through skin-care, 
dental retainers, or other less invasive procedures. For example South Korea 
has the highest per capita incidence of plastic surgery in Asia where one in 
five women between the ages of 19 and 49 has undergone a procedure. 
Three highly popular procedures are rhinoplasty (a nose job), blepharo-
plasty (eyelid lifts) and jaw reconstruction, all designed to produce a more 
Caucasian facial presentation. China and Japan also have very high rates of 
plastic surgery with the same procedures among the most popular. And be-
fore this appears to be a fixation of young girls, plastic surgery is also rising 
among young Asian men.
The point is that the variation of regional understandings of beauty is 
changing rapidly as Western images of supermodels and other "beautiful" 
celebrities circulate well beyond the West through television and the Web. 
The implications of these European-American models of beauty entering 
into "foreign" cultural contexts, where other 
models have persisted for generations, can be 
quite profound, disturbing, and even disastrous 
for these communities. An example comes from 
Fiji where researchers have been studying the 
effect of television on cultural norms from when 
it was introduced in the early 1990s.
What these researchers from Harvard 
Medical School have found is that in 1995, 
when the study began, there were no reported 
eating disorders among girls in Fiji. By 1998, 
however, after a steady diet of soap operas 
and seductive commercials, 11.3 percent of 
the adolescent girls reported purging at least 
once as a form of weight loss. The allure of 
Western representations of beauty on televi-
sion had a profound effect on body image and 
dieting practices there, where only positive 
body images attached to robust women (and 
men) had once prevailed and no one even 
knew  what dieting was. The result has been 
a new culture of dissatisfaction with one's own 
body and a desire to remake it as a vehicle for 
economic success. Most worrying, 25 percent 
of the girls surveyed about their body image

reported their negative view of their bodies had led to suicidal thoughts in 
the  previous year.
Cultural geographies of beauty reveal not only how ideals have emerged 
organically, connected to the particularities of a place, but also how foreign ide-
als have been introduced with little connection to the already established ideals 
at work in that place. In all cases, it seems that transforming the face and body 
are expected to have profound effects on future happiness and success, though 
there is no research as yet that unequivocally supports such a view except in 
cases where plastic surgery has been used to address significant disfigurement.
1. How is it that we can say that norms of beauty are a geographical 
phenomenon?
 
2. How has the spread of capitalism "displaced" beauty norms and what 
are some of the effects of this displacement?

In 2005, the United Nations made history by adopting the 
Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diver-
sity of Cultural Expressions (CDPGE). The convention "is a 
legally binding international agreement that ensures artists, 
cultural professionals, practitioners, and citizens world-
wide can create, produce, disseminate, and enjoy a broad 
range of cultural goods, services, and activities, including 
their own."8 This UN convention is just one of the ways that 
An illustration of the absence of a homogenous global 
culture is world music, the musical genre defined largely by 
the surge of non-English-language recordings released in the 
United Kingdom and the United States during the 1980s. The 
term is one employed primarily by the media and record stores, 
and it includes such diverse sources as Tuvan throat singers 
and Malian griots. (Throat singing is a performance style origi-
nating in south-central Russia where the vocal sounds are pro-
jected from the throat, allowing two to four tones to be simul-
taneously produced by the singer. Griots were ancient praise 
singers of West Africa and also important advisors to royalty.)
There are at least two major views on the effect of global-
ization on indigenous musical productions. The first empha-
sizes how the Western music industry has enabled indigenous 
music to be more widely disseminated and therefore more 
widely known and appreciated. This position sees local roots 
mixing with Western popular musical styles, with a hybrid 
sound resulting. The second view worries that the influence 
of Western musical styles and the Western music industry 
have transformed indigenous musical productions to the point 
where their authenticity has been lost and global musical het-
erogeneity diminished. Despite their fundamental disagree-
ment, holders of both positions recognize that world music 
has enabled cultural diversity to flourish and hope that indige-
nous performers will be able to resist the power of the Western 
music industry to homogenize their work and that at the same

Interestingly, at the same time that nations across the globe 
are reaching out to protect cultural diversity, cultural majori-
ties in the United States are collapsing. As we saw in Chapter 
3, predominantly black urban neighborhoods are receiving large 
influxes of Hispanics at the same time that white rural commu-
nities are changing as Asian and Hispanic migrants are moving 
there as well. The U.S. Census projects that white Americans 
will soon be a large minority among many other populous mi-
norities. It appears that in the next decade or so, Americans will 
all be cultural minorities as there will be no majority cultural 
group. Scholars have stated that there are no clear precedents in 
human history for such a culturally diverse place as the United 
States is soon to become.
APPLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE
1. What does cultural diversity mean in the context of the UN 
Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of 
Cultural Expressions?
2. Look at the recent census of your country and identify majority 
and minority ethnic groups. Are there any clear majority ethnic 
groups? According to you, what effect would the absence or 
presence of one of these majority groups have on your national 
culture more generally?
governing entities are actively working to encourage and pro-
tect culture and creativity in a rapidly changing world (Fig-
ure 5.27). Given this growing commitment to recognizing and 
proactively appreciating the relevance of cultural diversity 
to the global community, it seems reasonable to predict that 
culture—in both its material as well as less tangible manifes-
tations—will continue to be the focus of formal attention and 
support well into the future.
Importantly, connections across global space are making 
it increasingly possible for distant groups to share their ideas, 
cultural practices, and products in a way that helps both cir-
culate and sustain them. Geographers who work with culture 
as their research focus are beneficiaries of these trends as they 
seek to understand how culture is produced and maintained 
and how it morphs as it is practiced and shared across dis-
tances that once would have prohibited contact.
The UN CDPGE is just one example of how cultural diver-
sity matters in a globalizing world. One hundred and thirty-
three countries as well as the European Union have ratified the 
CPDCE pledging to protect and foster creativity and cultural di-
versity. With this broad commitment to cultural diversity well-
established across the globe, there appears to be, at the very 
least, a clear recognition of its present and future importance 
to social and economic development, environmental sustain-
ability, peace, and security.

Culture is a complex and exceedingly important concept 
within the discipline of geography. A number of approaches 
exist to understanding culture. It may be approached through 
a range of elements and features, from single traits to complex 
systems. Cultural geography recognizes the complexity of cul-
ture and emphasizes the roles of space, place, and landscape 
and the ecological relationships between cultures and their 
environments (Figure 5.28). It distinguishes itself from other 
disciplinary approaches, providing unique insights that reveal 
how culture shapes the worlds we live in at the same time that 
the worlds we inhabit shape culture.
Cultural geography is a diverse subfield that incorporates 
three general approaches. The first, traditional cultural geogra-
phy, is a reflection of the work of Carl Sauer, who understood 
landscape as the definitive unit of geographic study. The sec-
ond approach is centered on identity, ideology, power, and 
meaning. Gender and sexuality, race and ethnicity, as well as 
age and disability are frequent empirical objects of this ap-
proach. Most recently, cultural geography has been influenced 
by what has come to be known as the "non-representational" 
approach. Cultural geographers who are non-representational-
ists reject what they see as static views of space inherent in 
more conventional approaches and turn instead to an empiri-
cal focus on embodied practices and dynamic processes and 
how best to comprehend them and their effects without sacri-
ficing their dynamism.
Cultural geographers continue to embrace all of these ap-
proaches in their aims to understand how culture is the prod-
uct of humans' relationships with the world around them, a 
world that is alive with symbols, artifacts, practices, and 
discourses.

CHAPTER 5   Cultural Geographies   209
LEARNING OUTCOMES REVISITED
■ Describe how place and space shape culture and, conversely, 
how culture shapes place and space.
A simple understanding of culture is that it is a particu-
lar way of life, such as a set of skilled activities, values, 
and meanings surrounding a particular type of economic 
practice. Geographers understand culture to be shaped by 
the places in which people live and make meaning from 
their lives. This means that social relations, politics, and 
the economy all play a role in the production of cultural 
practices by different groups in different places.
■ Compare and contrast the different ways that contemporary 
approaches in cultural geography interpret the role played 
by politics and the economy in establishing and perpetuating 
cultures and cultural landscapes.
Culture is not something that is necessarily tied to a place 
and thus a fact waiting to be discovered. Rather, the con-
nections among people, places, and cultures are social 
creations that can be altered by new impulses from the 
economy or politics, for example, and are therefore always 
changing, sometimes in subtle and other times in more 
dramatic ways. As a result, a particular ethnic landscape 
may change dramatically after only a decade as the econ-
omy improves or declines and members of the group have 
access to additional or fewer resources that then shape 
their homes, vehicles, businesses, and so on.
■ Understand the ways that cultural differences—such as gen-
der, class, sexuality, race, and ethnicity—are both products of 
and influences on geography, producing important variations 
within, as well as between, individuals and groups.
Like most social scientists, geographers understand that 
cultural groups are not homogeneous. All women are not 
alike anymore than all working-class people are. Where 
people live can have an important impact on their sexual 
identity, for instance, when they are living in a place that 
is homophobic.
■ Explain the conceptual changes that are taking place in  cultural 
geography that include actor-network theory and non- 
representational theory.
Over the last decade, cultural geography has experienced 
a dramatic change in the way its practitioners think about 
the relationships between peoples and their worlds. These 
new ways of conceptualizing culture and space are still de-
veloping, but they focus on the importance of objects and 
material practices and how they shape the ways we experi-
ence and conduct our daily lives.
■ Demonstrate how globalization does not necessarily mean the 
world is becoming more homogeneous, and recognize that in 
some ways, globalization has made the local even more impor-
tant than before.
While globalization is undoubtedly reshaping the world 
and bringing different cultural groups closer together than 
they have ever been previously, there is no conclusive evi-
dence that globalization leads to cultural homogenization. 
Instead, globalization seems to be a differential process, 
which means that it is deployed differently in different 
places and experienced and responded to differently by 
the people who live in those places.

1. Using Billboard Magazine (a news magazine of the recording  
industry), construct a historical geography of the top 20 
singles over the last half century to determine how dif-
ferent regions of the country (or the globe) have risen and 
fallen in terms of musical significance. Determine an ap-
propriate interval for sampling—3 to 5 years is generally 
accepted. You may use the hometowns of the recording 
artists or the headquarters of the recording studios as your 
geographic variables. Once you have organized your data, 
answer the following questions: How has the geography 
you have documented changed? What might be the reasons 
for these changes? What do these changes mean for the 
regions of the country (or globe) that have increased or de-
creased in terms of musical prominence?
2. Ethnic identity is often expressed spatially through the 
existence of neighborhoods or business areas dominated 
by members of a particular group. One way to explore the 
spatial expression of ethnicity in a place is to look at news-
papers over time. Look at ethnic change in a particular 
neighborhood over time by using your library's holdings of 
local or regional newspapers. Examine change over at least 
a four-decade period. To do this, identify an area of the city 
in which you live or some other city for which your library 
has an extensive newspaper collection. Trace the history 
of an area you know is now occupied by a specific ethnic 
group. How long has the group occupied that area? What 
aspects of the group's occupation of that area have changed 
over time (school, church, or sports activities, or the age 
of the households)? If different groups have occupied the 
area, what might be the reasons for the changes?
 3. College and university campuses generate their own 
cultural practices and ideas that shape behaviors and at-
titudes in ways that may not be so obvious at first glance. 
Observe a particular practice that occurs routinely at 
your college or university. (For example, sports events, 
debates and class discussions, cultural events, and politi-
cal protests are important rituals of college life.) Who are 
the participants in this practice? What are their levels of 
importance? Are there gender, age, or status differences 
in those who carry out this practice? What are the time 
and space aspects of the practice? Who controls its pro-
duction? What are the intended outcomes? How does the 
practice contribute to or detract from the maintenance of 
order in the larger culture?
In what spaces might you project an identity that is not 
traditionally feminine or masculine? How does the space—
for example, a venue for job interview, a date, a sports 
competition, or a place of worship—shape your gender 
performance?
 3. Draw up a list of restaurants or food outlets in your city, 
and the corresponding cuisines they serve. Describe 
their menus and the kinds of food that are being served 
now. How may the cuisines have changed, adapted, and 
gained popularity? How are these changes and the con-
sequent popularity connected with global cultures, resis-
tance of the local, and perhaps the emergence of hybrid 
cultures?
 1. Make a list of movies that members of your group have 
viewed recently. Pick two of the films on which to conduct 
research. If possible, watch the trailers for each film. While 
watching the trailers, identify three different aspects of 
culture that are depicted. In terms of cultural geography, 
how do the aspects of culture you identified interact with 
space, place, and landscape?
 2. Variations in gender identities are often the result of the 
different spaces in which they are enacted. In your group, 
discuss what this means by creating a list of how gender 
might be performed in different spaces by members of 
your group. For instance, in what spaces are you likely 
to project a highly feminized or masculinized identity? 
REVIEW & DISCUSSION

CHAPTER 5   Cultural Geographies   211
DATA ANALYSIS
In this chapter, we have looked at culture as 
a dynamic process, integral to our identities 
and interactions in space, and as a complex 
category of study for geographers with notions 
of "affect," "emotion," and "materialism." We 
have also investigated how global economic 
forces can homogenize culture and how that 
"Westernization" can be both internalized and 
resisted by non-Western cultures. Part of the resistance to 
homogenizing culture is preserving traditions and the unique 
differences all over the world, and for every culture that 
sacred spaces. Why do we humans signify certain spaces to 
symbolize our cultural notions, and why do those spaces of-
ten conjure unique experiences?
Look at the UNESCO World Heritage Site and go to the  
interactive map at http://whc.unesco.org/en/interactive-map/
 1. Scroll over a region of the world and choose one of each 
of the following: a) a cultural site; b) a natural site; and 3) 
a site in danger. List the name of the site, what it is, and 
where in the world it is located.
 2. Analyzing the map, are there more sites in certain areas of 
the world? Why might that be?
 3. Next, review the latest "inscribed properties" at http://
whc.unesco.org/en/newproperties/. Choose one and list 
what the site is, where it is located and why it is culturally 
significant. What do you think about these spaces?
 4. Go to the UNESCO resource manual, Managing Cultural 
World Heritage at http://whc.unesco.org/en/resourcemanuals/ 
and skim the section, "Context: Managing World Heritage" 
(pp. 12-27) Then answer these questions:
  What is cultural heritage? Why is it of international impor-
tance to preserve it?
 5. Finally, what place in the world do you 
think has cultural significance and why 
should it be preserved for future genera-
tions? This can be any place you know or 
seek to know, constructed by humans or nat-
ural; it can be the best place to skateboard, a 
favorite place on a trail, or a movie theatre. 
Why would you preserve it? What is it about 
that space that shapes human identity?

AND BELIEF
6
As an infant—as young, perhaps, as 8 months old—you had to de-
termine the internal structure of a system that possesses tens of thousands 
of individual elements. Each of the elements is derived from the same col-
lection of materials and combined into larger units. Those units can be put 
together into an infinite set of combinations, although only a limited set of 
those joined units are correct within the context of the system. How does 
an infant proceed? Fortunately, we tend to learn this system effortlessly: The 
system is language, and it is composed of words, sounds, and sentences.
But now imagine that you're a deaf child, 6 or 7 years old. You have reached 
this age not fully understanding what it means to be deaf. Imagine how much 
more difficult the mission of acquiring language will be for you. Of course, 
there will not necessarily be sounds involved in forming your language, but 
there must be something else to take the place of sound that will allow you to 
communicate the words and the sentences you wish to convey.
Imagine further in this already challenging scenario that it's 1970 and you 
live in Managua, Nicaragua, and there are no teachers at your school who 
know sign language. What is perhaps even more remarkable than the capacity 
of the hearing infant's ability to comprehend and eventually use language is 
the capacity of a group of deaf children, assembled in a collective but without 
the aid of a sign language instructor, to develop their own language so they're 
able communicate with each other.1
These children developed the Nicaraguan Sign Language. It is a unique exam-
ple of how language emerges and becomes populated with a structure, words, 
and sentences. The deaf children created the language, not with the help of their 
teachers or their parents or any other adults but through their interactions with 
each other. Independently, they constructed a natural sign language that contains 
the kinds of grammatical regularities that are key to all languages. And, since the

1970s, the language has continued to develop and change 
as each new generation has learned it from the previous 
one while adding their own structure and content.
For geographers, one particularly interesting part of 
this story is the way the deaf children came to develop 
spatial devices to signal differences. A hand signal es-
tablishes directional coordinates such as here and there 
or near and far or left, right, and center. And spatial co-
ordinates are as key to the Nicaraguan Sign Language as 
they are to any language. Where something is happen-
ing or has happened, or how the language incorporates 
space, matters. As with all languages, in the Nicaraguan 
case, while new generations of deaf children were fig-
uring out the code that was being passed along to them 
from an older one, they were also adding their own 
words and understandings and improving upon the 
language by drawing from their internal learning abili-
ties. Language, like culture more generally, is dynamic.
This story of Nicaraguan language inventors tells us 
much about the human need to communicate. It also 
tells us that geographical context is central to commu-
nication whether through sign language or the spoken 
word. In this chapter we more closely examine lan-
guage and communication as well as belief systems to 
reveal the extent and type as well as the geographical 
distribution and spatial significances of all three.
GEOGRAPHIES OF LANGUAGE
Language and religion are two key elements in a cultural sys-
tem. Their dynamism is anchored in communication within a 
group of speakers and adherents. Both are also markers of in-
dividual and collective identity and their geographies—where 
particular languages are spoken or particular religions are prac-
ticed. In the first section of this chapter we explore language 
and communication as interdependent processes. In the second 
section we turn to belief. In both sections we explore not only 
how language, communication, and religion work but also how 
they are distributed across a range of spaces and how space it-
self shapes their practice. We address ourselves to the organi-
zation, diffusion, and strength or decline of both language and 
religion as well as explore less-conventional forms of both.
What Is Language?
Language is a means of communicating ideas or feelings by 
way of a conventionalized system of signs, gestures, marks, or 
articulate vocal sounds (Figure 6.1). In short, communication is 
symbolic, based on commonly understood meanings of signs 
or sounds. It is an important aspect of culture, and without it, 
cultural accomplishments would be lost. As well, we would 
have a hard time even staying alive. In fact, language is so cen-
tral to almost everything we do as humans that it's difficult to 
imagine what it would be like not to have it. What if we didn't 
have names for things—food, help, you and me—and what if 
we weren't able to make statements or ask questions?
Linguists, the people who study language, believe that with-
out concepts—words that contain meaning—it would be difficult 
to think. We would still experience things like lightness or cold 
or pain, but without the concept of pain, we couldn't commu-
nicate our condition to others so that we might get some relief. 
The importance of concepts to thought doesn't mean that with-
out them it would be impossible to speak or even think; it just 
means that certain kinds of thinking can happen only because 
we have language. For instance, the Amondawa people of the 
Amazon rain forest have no concept of time. They have no calen-
dars, watches, or mechanisms that measure or count the passage 
of time. There are only divisions of day and night and rainy and 
dry seasons. No one in the community has an age; instead they 
change their names to reflect their stage in the life cycle.
Language both reflects and influences the way different 
groups understand and interpret the world around them by 
providing each group with often distinct concepts and vocabu-
lary as the example of the Amondawa illustrates. Every lan-
guage contains the elements necessary to communicating all 
kinds of different thoughts. Yet what makes language so inter-
esting is that those thoughts can be conveyed in very different 
ways depending on the language. Additionally, all languages 
have a structure that includes rules of grammar, specialized vo-
cabularies, and systems of pronunciation.

an expected gesture of respect made by a young person to an older one.

CHAPTER 6   Language, Communication, and Belief    215
Within standard languages, regional variations, known as di-
alects, exist. Dialects feature pronunciation, grammar, and vocab-
ulary that are place-based. The term is most often associated with 
regional speech patterns. It is often said that dialects reflect the 
everyday lives of its speakers as they encounter new people and 
things. Standard language (also known as official language) is 
made in government offices, in the courts, and in the schools and 
is less alive and more artificial, though it, of course, also changes.
In the next section we will examine the distribution of lan-
guages at the global, regional, and local levels. These different 
distributions provide us with a sense of who is communicat-
ing how, where, and with whom through standard languages. It 
will also help us to appreciate where some languages are gain-
ing ground—bringing in new speakers in places where it was 
not previously dominant or even spoken at all—while others 
are losing it as fewer individuals are learning or using the lan-
guage that was previously dominant.
APPLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE
1. What is the difference between a "dialect" and a "standard language"?
2. What dialects are spoken in your country? Has your own dialect 
changed as you've traveled, gained employment, or relocated to 
a different place? Why do you think that might be? What are the 
places in your country where a more standardized form of language 
is used? Why do you think it is required?
The World of Language
The distribution of languages can tell us much about the 
changing history of human geography and the impact of the 
movement of people, ideas, capital, and technology glob-
ally. Language experts generally agree that there are about 
6,900 different languages in the world today. Very large lan-
guages tend to have millions or billions of speakers, while 
very small languages have fewer than 100 speakers. Eng-
lish and Chinese are among the very large global languages 
with billions of speakers. Jeru, a language of the Andaman 
Islands south of Burma, and Dothraki and High Valyrian, 
the invented languages of Game of Thrones, each currently 
have fewer than 30 fluent speakers and are considered very 
small languages.
Figure 6.2 provides a global snapshot of language distribu-
tion. Of course the scale is too small to see much within-country  
variation let alone regional or local variation. Figure 6.3  
provides a more refined view of language variation with one 
very large country, India. And Figure 6.4 is a graphic map of 
New York City that shows the languages most often used with 
Twitter. Although the 2010 U.S. Census indicates that New 
York is the most linguistically diverse city in the world, the 
Twitter map shows only the tweets in the major languages 
spoken there; it is estimated that as many as 800 different lan-
guages are actually spoken.

▲ Figure 6.3 Language map of India It is possible to appreciate from this map the persistence of the linguistic complexity of India. A country that did not 
suppress regional languages when it became independent, India possesses hundreds of distinct languages.

The Garifuna Example Garifuna is one among hun-
dreds of New York City languages, but it is mainly spoken in 
Honduras and Belize, with smaller numbers of speakers in 
Nicaragua and Guatemala. Garifuna is a member of the Ar-
awakan language family and may have been brought to the 
Island of St. Vincent, in the Lesser Antilles, from the Orinoco 
River Valley in present-day Venezuela as well as from coastal 
Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and parts of the island 
of Trinidad. Arawakan was the largest indigenous language 
family in South America and the Caribbean at the time of Eu-
ropean contact.
The Garinagu people (those who speak Garifuna) are 
largely descended from West Africans who were en route to 
South America having been pressed into slavery. Historical re-
cords suggest that because of a shipwreck, they ended up in 
St. Vincent. In addition to Arawak, Garifuna language contains 
a high number of words from Carib, another native language 
of South America from people who also originated along the 
northern coast of South America and the southern West Indies. 
Garifuna also contains contributions from a number of West 
African languages including Yoruba, Ibo, and Ashanti from 
present-day Benin, Ghana, Nigeria, Mali, Sierra Leone, and 
the Democratic Republic of Congo. Finally, Garifuna includes 
words and speech patterns from a number of European lan-
guages due, of course, to the arrival of Columbus in 1492. In 
fact, the Arawak were the first New World people  Columbus 
and his crew encountered. Because Garifuna is influenced 
by so many other languages, it is known as a fusion language  
(Figure 6.5 a & b).
Over the centuries, the Garinagu experienced prosper-
ity as well as war and imprisonment. They were eventually 
banished from St. Vincent and fled to Honduras, Belize, Ni-
caragua, and Guatemala. In the nineteenth and twentieth 
centuries, the Garinagu began migrating in large numbers 
to New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, New Orleans, and other 
U.S. cities in search of better employment and education op-
portunities. Today, classes in Garifuna are being offered to 
the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of these migrants 
in an effort to keep the language alive among ethnic Garinagu 
who are more likely to speak Spanish or English.
One notable aspect of the Garifuna language is its re-
lationship to music, through which the oral traditions of 
the culture have been maintained. The language is not only 
spoken and written, but also sung, in its modern form. Its 
musical form has been described by the United Nations Ed-
ucational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) 
as "a veritable repository of the history and traditional 
knowledge of the Garifuna [sic], such as cassava-growing, 
fishing, canoe-building and the construction of baked mud 
houses." In addition to illustrating the complexity of lan-
guage change and distribution and the multiple forces at 
work that effect these, Garifuna also provides an example 
of the relevance of the different ways language is communi-
cated. Before looking more closely at the geography of lan-
guage and the impacts of globalization upon the changing 
distribution of languages, it is necessary to become familiar 
with some of the basics on how language is organized.
APPLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE
1. How is the Garifuna language also a story of human migration 
and power relations between people? Think about slavery, colo-
nialism, cultural exchange, and the effect of music and dance on 
language. What do these human stories tell you about language 
development?
2. What is another language that has developed from the cultural 
mixing that comes from colonialism or forced migration? Come up 
with either a historical or current example.

CHAPTER 6   Language, Communication, and Belief    219
LANGUAGE RELATIONSHIPS  
AND DYNAMICS
To delineate the relationships among and between the thou-
sands of languages spoken across the globe, language special-
ists classify them largely with respect to their connections. 
Most languages are related to one or more other languages 
so that the thousands of languages that exist globally can be 
classified into 90 different language families, six of which 
are considered major language families. Families are further 
divided into branches and groups (Figure 6.6), and their rela-
tionships are graphically represented as trees.
Language Family
A language family is a collection of individual languages be-
lieved to be related in their prehistoric origin. About 50 percent 
of the world's people speak a language that belongs to the Indo-
European family. Although part of a family, a language branch is 
a collection of languages that possesses a definite common origin 
but have split into individual languages. A third category used 
to show the structure of language is a language group, a cluster 
of individual languages that are part of a language branch, have 
shared a common origin in the recent past, and have relatively 
similar grammar and vocabulary. Spanish, French, Portuguese, 
Italian, Romanian, and Catalan are a language group, classified 
under the Romance branch as part of the Indo-European lan-
guage family. Some language families contain more than 1,000 
languages and others contain only a few.
Language Trees
A language tree is a representation of the relationships of lan-
guages to each other. The tree model is meant to mimic a family 
tree with languages substituted for real family members. The form 
of the language tree is a node-link diagram that contains branch 
points, or nodes, from which the daughter languages—offspring 
of older languages—descend by different links. The nodes are 
proto-languages, also known as common languages. In concep-
tualizing the descent of language, linguists intend to show that 
a linked language is an offshoot established through a process

HUMAN GEOGRAPHY   Places and Regions in Global Context
of gradual modification over time. According to the family tree 
model, languages are thought to have a kind of genetic relation-
ship to those languages in which they share a line of descent.
If you were to use a map in conjunction with the tree model 
so that the language at the end of each node was connected to 
the corresponding country, you'd see that geography is central 
to understanding language transformation, you'll see that geog-
raphy is often central to understanding its transformation and 
the location of its speakers. Take the node just below North Ger-
manic in Figure 6.7. Old Norse, Old  Swedish, and Old Danish 
were produced by linguistic drift, a process of random change 
inherent to all languages. Though the speakers would appear to 
be geographically close in modern terms, in the period of lan-
guage divergence, communication would have gradually be-
come more difficult as people migrated or somehow became 
disconnected over time from their original community.
Before a language can change, speakers must adopt new 
words, sentence structures, and sounds; spread them through 
the community; and transmit them to the next generation. It 
is widely accepted that children are usually the most active 
agents of language change. When learning the language of their 
parents, they internalize the language differently and, espe-
cially with advances in communication media over time, form 
and disseminate a variation of that language.
The Icelandic Example A contrasting example of language 
change to Garifuna is Icelandic, one of the most unchanged and 
purest in the world. It is the mother tongue—a language that a 
person has learned from birth or the first few years of life—of 
about 320,000 people, most of whom live in Iceland. Icelandic, 
a direct descendant of Old Norse, is what the Vikings would 
have spoken (between about 800 C.E. and 1050 C.E.). Icelandic 
belongs to the Western Scandinavian language group. Of all the 
languages in the Old Norse branch, Icelandic has changed the 
least in the past 1,000 years.
This relative absence of change is because of the some-
what remote location of the Icelandic people, who were able to 
maintain their language because there were few external forces 
of change; as well, it was culturally dominant; with respect to 
the other languages they encountered. Icelandic has changed 
so little that contemporary Icelandic speakers could have a 
completely intelligible written correspondence with a Viking—
a 1,000-year-old person! That is because the spelling, seman-
tics (the meaning of a word or phrase), and word order vary 
only slightly. To appreciate how amazing this is, consider the 
experience of reading Shakespeare in Early Modern English, 
the language in which he wrote. Some of you will have had 
that experience already in a course and know what a struggle 
it is. Most students need a translation sheet to accomplish this. 
Recall that Early Modern English 
was in use between 1450 c.E. and 
1600 C.E. whereas Old Norse is 
much older, in use between 800 
C.E. and 1200 C.E..
Old Norse is part of the Indo-
European language family. It fol-
lows the Germanic branch and the 
North Germanic group as well as 
daughter languages, including Ice-
landic. English is also a branch of 
the Germanic family, though it is 
an offshoot of the West  Germanic 
branch (Figure 6.7). Some common 
English words that have come to 
us from Old Norse include awe (as 
in awesome!), bug (the insect, not 
the verb "to annoy"), fog (which, 
incorrectly, we think of as thor-
oughly English, as in London fog), 
hell, trust, ugly, and many more. 
The reason we find these words 
in English is that the Vikings 
colonized eastern and northern 
England.
When speakers of different 
but related varieties of languages 
are able to understand each 
other, the languages are said to be 
 mutually intelligible.  Mutually 
intelligible languages are fre-
quently geographically close.

APPLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE
1. How does geography affect language development and/or preser-
vation? Think about the Icelandic example and compare it to how 
other Germanic languages have developed in different parts of 
the world.
2. Can you find other examples of a language that has been 
preserved as well as one that has developed through spatial 
interactions?
Ultraconserved Words Linguists believe that most words 
disappear from the human vocabulary after 8,000-9,000 years. 
This occurs because of the adoption of new words as well as 
linguistic weathering—a sort of "wearing out" of words. But 
recently, linguists have found that about a dozen words in use 
today are about 15,000 years old. These are words that have 
survived while the languages of which they were a part have 
died out. The following speech assembles all the words lin-
guists believe have survived for 150 centuries:
You, hear me! Give this fire to that old man. Pull the 
black worm off the bark and give it to the mother. And 
no spitting in the ashes!
Where these ultraconserved words 
originated geographically is the subject of 
much controversy. There is some agree-
ment among experts, however, that they 
are from a language that existed in places 
where people survived the last glacial pe-
riod around 20,000-25,000 years ago. This 
area is thought to be in Eurasia.
Official Language (Standard Lan-
guage) Linguistic experts often think 
of colonialism as the force behind the 
erasure of local languages. A closer look, 
however, reveals that the modern state 
and capital are the instituations likely to 
be the force behind language loss through 
the promotion of official language. Recall 
that official language is the language in 
which the government, including the 
courts, the legislature, and the adminis-
trative branch, conducts its business. To 
ease the way for economic growth and 
official government business, such as 
tax collection, a governing body requires 
a reduction in the number of languages 
existing in any territory. For example, 
as early as the sixteenth century, the 
highly centralized French State began to 
actively discourage the use of regional 
languages and dialects in official trans-
actions. Following the overthrow of the 
monarchy in France in the late eighteenth century, the new 
French republic more actively advanced a policy intended to 
establish unity among the various provinces by suppressing 
the regional languages. The multiplicity of languages was seen 
as a barrier to stable democracy and egalitarianism.
The argument for such a policy was that free people, mean-
ing those who were no longer subjects of the monarch, must 
speak the same language (north-central, or Parisian French) to 
unify France and promote democracy as a way of life. Otherwise 
how could the people create and operate a government if they 
could not speak to each other? As a result, the regional languages 
and dialects of France went into a decline, hastened by official 
government policies spanning an extended period from Napo-
leon to de Gaulle. Figure 6.8 shows the distribution of regional 
languages and dialects in France before the French Revolution.
In the early 1980s, the French government, in a reversal 
of nearly 400 years of regional language and dialect suppres-
sion, reassessed its official language policies. Responding to 
the emergence of the European Union and fearing the erosion 
of French culture more generally, the French government now 
regards regional languages as a treasure. In the early 1990s, 
the French government began financing bilingual education in 
▼ Figure 6.8 Regional languages and dialects of France French is the 
official language of France, but several regional languages are also spoken as a 
secondary language after French. The government is required by law to com-
municate to the population in French.

state schools in regions with indigenous languages. Now, the 
revival of regional languages is viewed by the government as 
a way of moderating the homogenizing forces of globalization.
Language Hearths
Traditional approaches in geography have identified the 
source areas of the world's languages and the paths of diffu-
sion of those languages from their places of origin. Carl Sauer 
labeled the geographical source of certain cultural practices as 
"cultural hearths." Cultural hearths, discussed in Chapter 5, 
are the geographic origins of innovations, ideas, or ideologies. 
Language hearths are a subset of cultural hearths; they are the 
source areas of languages. Figure 6.9 depicts the hearth area of 
the Indo-European language family which possesses over 3 bil-
lion speakers.
Place Names One way that language and geography come 
together is in place names (toponyms). The names are a kind 
of living record of the previous occupants of a place and their 
ways of doing things. They also can reflect migrants' longings 
for their homeland, a group's attitudes toward the environment, 
as well as a range of other emotions including humor, revenge, 
cynicism, and even reverence. Mostly, however, place names 
are a reflection of the kinds of economic activities that once oc-
curred there such as the Meatpacking District in New York City 
or the ubiquitous Bank Street. 
They can also reflect colonial in-
sensitivities in a new land.
In the United States, for ex-
ample, many Native American 
groups have appealed to the U.S. 
Board of Geographic Names to 
have the word "squaw" removed 
from over 800 U.S. geographic 
landforms such as Squaw Peak, 
Squaw Lake, and Squaw Mesa. 
These groups argue that in a range 
of Indian languages, squaw is a 
pejorative term for vagina, though 
there is controversy about the 
derivation of the word among lin-
guists. The U.S. Board has chosen 
not to make any changes despite 
the many appeals. In contrast, the 
city of Phoenix was moved by the 
appeal from local Indigenous peo-
ple to change the iconic landform 
Squaw Peak (originally Squaw Tit 
Peak) within its urban boundaries 
to Piestewa Peak (Figure 6.10).
As place names, these words 
remind us of how powerful lan-
guage can be—even a single 
word. It is interesting that while 
the federal government has been 
reluctant to remove the word 
squaw, derived from the Algon-
quin (Indian) language, when it 
is used as a toponym on federal 
lands, a city experiencing that 
toponym on a daily basis was far 
more sensitive to its offensive-
ness and able to remove it from 
the urban landscape at the same 
time that it was able to com-
memorate a Native American 
woman—Lori Piestewa, a mem-
ber of the Hopi nation who died 
in combat in the Iraq war—in a 
respectful and honorable way.
▲ Figure 6.10 Piestewa Peak, Phoenix, Arizona Lori Piestewa was the first Native American woman in history 
to die in combat while serving with the U.S. military. Piestewa Peak was named after her to honor her bravery.

CHAPTER 6   Language, Communication, and Belief    223
Identity and Language
India presents an interesting illustration of a country where 
state-mandated language standardization is relatively minimal 
compared to countries such as Germany, where 95 percent of 
the population speaks German. Over 1,600 languages are spo-
ken in India representing four major language branches. The 
Indo-European family, introduced by Aryan herdsmen who mi-
grated from central Asia between 1500 and 500 b.C.E., is preva-
lent in the northern plains region, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives. 
This language family includes Hindi, Bengali, Punjabi, Bihari, 
and Urdu. Munda languages are spoken among the tribal peo-
ples who still inhabit the more remote hill regions of peninsu-
lar India. Dravidian languages (which include Tamil, Telugu, 
Kanarese, and Malayalam) are spoken in southern India and 
the northern part of Sri Lanka. Finally, Tibeto-Burmese lan-
guages are scattered across the Himalayan region.
When India became independent in 1947, the boundaries of 
many of the country's constituent states were established on the 
basis of language, resulting in no single language being spoken or 
understood by more than 40 percent of the people. Efforts have 
been made since independence to establish Hindi, the most prev-
alent language, as the national language. This move, however, 
has been resisted by many of the states within India, whose po-
litical identity is now closely aligned with a different language.
The lingua franca—a common language among speakers 
whose native languages are different—in India is English, which 
serves as the link between its states and regions but is spoken by 
fewer than 6 percent of Indians. As in other former British colo-
nies in South Asia, English is the language of higher education, 
the professions, and national business and government. Hindi 
and English are the official languages of the country, but English 
is more powerful than Hindi in terms of its wider global reach, 
offering opportunity for economic or social mobility.
Most children who attend school are taught only their 
local language, which inevitably restricts their prospects. 
A guard, sweeper, cook, or driver who speaks only Hindi or 
Urdu will likely do the same work all his life. In contrast, those 
who can speak English—by definition the upper and middle 
classes—are able to practice their profession or do business in 
any region of their country or in most parts of the world. India 
illustrates the decline or endangerment of local languages glob-
ally as more and more of the population comes to understand 
that learning English is their ticket to a better life (see Box 6.1: 
"Geography Matters: Language Revival").
Where the majority (or officially powerful) language pro-
vides access to economic opportunities, information, cultural 
products, social status, power, prestige, and other benefits and 
the minority language, however widely practiced, 
mainly serves to maintain ties to the past, the el-
derly, and the local community, the latter is likely 
eventually to be lost. The loss occurs over several 
generations, as the minority language is relevant 
in more and more restricted contexts and for fewer 
and fewer significant purposes. Figure 6.11 shows 
endangered language hotspots around the world.

do you think is gained in this process? What is lost?
2. Think of an example of a toponym that is controversial, provoca-

munity who inhabits the space? Is there a story behind the name 
that brings the community together or perhaps alienates some of 
them? How might toponyms reflect social relationships of gender, 
race, ethnicity, class, and culture?

6.1 Geography Maters
Around the world, "big" languages—like English, Spanish, Russian, and 
 Chinese—are gaining speakers, while "small" languages—like Inupiat, 
Q'anjob'al, Kildin Sami, and Kangjia—lose speakers. This cultural erosion 
process is due to the combined effects of government policies, new com-
munication technologies, and the countless choices made by people as they 
go about their daily lives. Language decline is so common that when a small 
language undergoes a revival, scholars pay attention.
Signs of Linguistic Revival
How do we know when a language is reviving? In recent years it has become 
common for organizations, political parties, churches, and academic asso-
ciations in New Zealand to refer to their home as "Aotearoa New  Zealand." 
Driving through the Four Corners region of the American southwest, it is 
possible to catch news broadcasts in the Navajo language. In Wales, English 
is now supplemented with Welsh in school curricula, the media, and public 
space. The change is obvious in Quebec, where French is the predominant 
language on billboards, shop windows, and road signs (see Figure 6.A).
A language revival may involve an increase in the number of people 
who speak a language, but more often (and more importantly) it involves 
improvements in a language group's ethnolinguistic vitality. This term, coined 
in 1977 by a team with international expertise in linguistics and psychology,i 
refers to three interconnected and crucial aspects of a language: status, 
 demography, and institutional support. When the outlook for a minority 
language improves, it is through any—or all—of the following: improved 
public perception of the language, growing numbers of 
speakers, and better incorporation of the language into 
media, schools, and government.
What Languages Are Treatened?
Many of the world's threatened languages are minor-
ity languages. This means they are a mother tongue for 
well under half of a particular  country's population. Of-
ten these are indigenous languages, like Native Ameri-
can and First Nations languages in North America, the  
Aboriginal languages in  Australia, and Māori in  
New Zealand.
In some cases the majority language in a country 
can be threatened with a loss of status and then display 
a comeback. During the Soviet era, citizens in Eastern 
Europe were expected to speak Russian, effectively 
making  Russian the region's lingua franca. But in the 
post-Soviet era, state leaders in Eastern Europe have 
worked to reestablish the ethnolinguistic vitality of their 
various state languages. In 2007, for example, Ukraine's 
Constitutional Court ruled that all foreign language 
films must be dubbed or subtitled in Ukrainian, symbol-
ically demoting Russian to the same subordinate status 
as any other foreign language.

◀ Figure 6.A The office of the French language  
(L'office de la langue française) has gone to great lengths 
to erase the English influence from the landscape in 
Quebec. Stop signs say "ARRÊT," although in France they 
say "STOP." Note the Quebec flag in the background 
and the term "guichet  automatique" in the window 
rather than "ATM."

CHAPTER 6   Language, Communication, and Belief    225
Linguistic Contestation
Where are the battles fought for the status of endangered  languages? One place 
is in the streets. Hundreds of people have lost their lives to bombings and assassi-
nations related to the  independence struggle of Euskal  Herria, or "the land of the 
Basque language," a region at the western end of the Pyrenees (see Figure 6.B).  
In striking contrast, only one life has been lost in Quebec's struggle for sou-
veraineté. There, the battle has been fought in the Parliament of Canada, the 
National Assembly of Quebec, and the Canadian Supreme Court. Quebec's 
Law 101 was particularly important as it made French the official language of 
government, schools, businesses, and public places. This law demoted Eng-
lish from the position of official language. Across the Atlantic, Latvian leaders 
took inspiration from the success of Law 101 in Canada, and passed a similar 
law establishing Latvian as the official state  language of Latvia while demot-
ing Russian.ii
Annual festivals and gatherings are also important settings for the re-
vitalization of endangered languages. These are particularly important 
for groups that are widely dispersed or split by national borders. For 
example, the Riddu Riddu Riđđu festival, held every summer since 1993 
in northern Norway, brings together the indigenous Sami people of 
Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia. This festival includes Sami language 
classes, yoiking (an indigenous oral tradition), youth camp, literature, and 
storytelling.
Why Protect Endangered Languages?
From the perspective of a speaker of one of these languages, the stakes are 
clear: protecting a language preserves the heart of a culture. For others, the

reasons may be a bit more abstract. The European Union offered protec-
tion to Europe's minority languages with a 2001 resolution stating that: "all 
European languages are equal in value and dignity from the cultural point 
of view and form an integral part of European culture and civilization." The 
United Nations has passed a number of resolutions aimed at protecting mi-
nority languages as a foundation for civil rights and as a way of safeguarding 
humanity's "intangible cultural heritage."
Competing with English
How do these changes relate to the rise of English as an international lin-
gua franca? Careers in science and technology, international business, medi-
cine, or public policy increasingly require fluency in English. While English 
speakers have the luxury of being understood all over the world, the rise of 
English complicates the preservation of endangered languages. The task of 
learning English cuts into the time that the speakers of these endangered lan-
guages could spend transmitting their languages to the next generation. The 
necessity of learning English also reduces the time spent perfecting skills to 
meet the local standards of literacy in national languages other than English. 
It is not unusual for college-bound students in minority language regions to 
be trilingual, but mastering the lingua franca of English can take a toll on the 
ethnolinguistic vitality of many minority languages.

1. Identify minority languages in your region. Find out if they are still 
spoken or used, and the reasons for them still being in use. 
2. What do you think is the relationship between communities prac-
ticing minority and majority languages? Examine how relations of 
social power are articulated between such communities due to the 
practice of a minority language by one vis-à-vis the use of an  
official or majority language by another.
3. In your own community, are there struggles over a minority lan-
guage that are manifested in the landscape?
COMMUNICATION
Language lives through practice, and without that language 
slowly dies. There are cases, such as in France, where lan-
guages on the brink of extinction have been brought back 
to life. Language revival, as the Geography Matters box dis-
cusses, happens because the standard practices that consti-
tute language—speaking, writing, reading, and so on—are 
supported through government programs or a concerted, orga-
nized effort by a language community that puts the language 
back into use.
The most common and original way that language is commu-
nicated is verbally through speech. Most of us are surrounded by 
speech inside the womb and as infants. Typically, this early expo-
sure to the spoken word is the pathway for our entrance into our 
own language community. Geographers are interested not only in 
where different languages are spoken—whether across the globe 
or across town—but also in the question of how that language is 
understood and deployed by speakers and how children's lan-
guage acquisition varies across class and geography.
Geographies of Language Learning Researchers note 
that in white middle-class homes in Australia, norms and 
expectations about how children participate in social situ-
ations are different from those in the nearby region of ru-
ral and lower-class Papua New Guinea. In the Australian 
homes, mothers believe that infants possess intentionality 
and have the ability to express it, whether in simple sounds 
or full words. When teaching children to speak there, moth-
ers engage in intense face-to-face interactions and treat their 
children as competent speaking partners. In parts of Papua 
New Guinea, however, mothers believe they must speak 
for their children and so turn them to face outward toward 
other members of the household. When those members of 
the household address the infant, their mothers respond by 
speaking for them in a high-pitched voice that is different 
from their own speaking voice. Importantly, both groups' 
children learn to speak their language effectively despite the 
different ways they are introduced to them.These examples 
demonstrate that children acquire language in culturally ex-
plicit and implicit ways.
Research also has shown that language acquisition is key 
to a child's future success in school. In the United States, 
extensive studies of children who have limited speaking in-
teractions in early language acquisition have shown them 
to have a reduced vocabulary and inhibited intellectual de-
velopment. This situation can occur in households in the 
United States where a single, working parent has limited 
time to spend with a growing infant. The communication 
of language and the acquisition of language-speaking skills 
vary on any number of axes, not only around the world but 
even within the same city or town.
Writing and Reading Language is also communicated 
through the written word. Books, newspapers, advertisements, 
text messages, greeting cards, tweets, instagrams, posts, e-
mails, and Web pages, all are the products of written language 
and require an ability to read letters, words, sentences, and 
even images through a particular language structure. Written 
communication depends not only on the ability to relay infor-
mation using an understood language system but also on an 
equivalent ability to read that information. Increasingly, of 
course, electronic translation software is enabling a kind of 
mutual intelligibility, even between languages that have noth-
ing in common.
Those unable to read or write are said to be illiterate. 
Access to written information is often central to social and 
economic success, so the limitations of literacy can have a pro-
found impact on an individual. Illiteracy is a problem both in 
poor countries in the periphery with limited access to school-
ing as well as in wealthy countries in the same spaces where 
literacy among middle- and upper-income populations is very 
high. Box 6.2: "Spatial Inequality: Geographies of Literacy" 
illustrates the geography of this worldwide problem, which 
tends to affect females more than males.
The Story of Writing The story of writing parallels the 
story of language but does not have the same plot, and its 
cast of characters and key events come from different places 
in human history. The Sumerians—who lived in Mesopota-
mia, which is effectively modern-day Iraq—are believed to be 
one of the earliest people to establish a writing system, known 
as cuneiform, named for the wedge shape of its letters. The 
 Sumerians' writing system was originally a series of scratches 
in soft clay, done first by hand and later with a stylus. These 
scratches were pictograms, pictures meant to represent words. 
Early  Sumerian cuneiform was comprised of approximately 
1,500 pictograms, each of which represents a thing or an idea 
or even a sound, so that a picture of a bird is the same as the 
word for bird. While the Sumerians were among the first to de-
velop a written language, other cultures developed their own, 
including the Egyptians with their hieroglyphic inscriptions, a 
written language also based on pictograms, but more abstract 
than cuneiform (Figure 6.12).
Researchers believe that the first alphabets were de-
veloped in Egypt. That alphabet was soon improved by the 

CHAPTER 6   Language, Communication, and Belief    227
Phoenicians, traders in the circum-Mediterranean Sea who cre-
ated a network of city-states along the coasts they visited in 
Africa, Spain, and Sicily. The Phoenicians were responsible for 
replacing the pictograms with an alphabet of consonants that 
were easy to learn, write, and change. The Greeks introduced 
vowels to the alphabet. The Latin alphabet, introduced by the 
Romans (by way of the Etruscans), is the same one used in this 
book, except that the Romans had only 23 letters—omitting the 
letters J, U, and W.
Early writing was done on clay, stone, wax tablets, wood, 
metal, papyrus, parchment, or vellum, and the writing imple-
ment was a reed, chisel, quill, and eventually a broad nib pen. 
Writing was also done on walls. The word graffiti, refers to the 
inscriptions—largely figure drawings—scratched on walls in 
ancient Rome (Figure 6.13). Then grafitti was meant to convey 
philosophical thoughts or advance political rhetoric. It was also 
occasionally used to publicly communicate love for another. 
Today, grafitti is also used to express love and politics but is 
also frequently used to mark territory. A recent tragic illustra-
tion of the political power of graffiti is the messages painted 
by 15 schoolboys between the ages of 10 and 15 on the walls 
of buildings in Daara, Syria. They wrote: "As-Shaab/Yoreed/
Eskaat el nizam!" ("The people/want/to topple the regime!"). 
Considered to be the spark that ignited the Syrian Revolution 
in March 2012, these boys were arrested and later tortured by 
soldiers enforcing a law against antigovernment speech.

1. Where and how did writing first develop in the world?
2. How do you think technology has changed writing? Think about 
content, formality, new spellings, and modes of expression (emoti-
cons, photos with texts, sound). How have these different types 
of writing changed language and symbology? For example, the 
sign #, used to signify "number", has recently come to signify a 
"hashtag" (a metadata symbol that allows grouping of messages) 
through media like Twitter and has taken on a whole new concep-
tual meaning in all forms of writing.
Slang Because of its liveliness, language is often adapted for 
different purposes or new language is developed by subsets of 
language users such as teenagers or people who live in sepa-
rate communities or who work in special sorts of jobs. Slang 
is language that consists of nonstandard words and phrases 
and is a common occurrence among most languages. It's also 
known as patios, argot, and jargon. It's possible that you are 
part of a subset of language users who have invented, or at the 
very least transmitted, nonstandard words or phrases within 
your own language, whether that's English or something else. 
As mentioned, young people are frequently the most active 
agents of change in a language, introducing not only new 
words but also new forms of language use. Today, much slang 
comes from rap music and gets deployed through the lyrics 
of tunes.

At a very basic level, literacy is the ability to read and write. Being able to 
read and write allows us to determine more readily the course of our lives 
as we push beyond simply comprehending language and reproducing it to 
transforming who we are and what we are able to do in the world. UNESCO 
defines literacy as the "ability to identify, understand, interpret, create, com-
municate and compute, using printed and written materials associated 
with varying contexts. Literacy involves a continuum of learning in enabling 
individuals to achieve their goals, to develop their knowledge and potential, 
and to participate fully in their community and wider society."2
In the United States, one of the wealthiest countries on Earth, there 
are 44 million people—many of whom are incarcerated—who are 
 functionally illiterate. Functional illiteracy means that an individual's read-
ing and writing skills are inadequate to manage daily living or hold down a 
job that requires reading skills beyond a basic level. Figure 6.C is a variation

on a widely broadcast and particularly worrying trend in the United States 
that a grade four reading level is the best predictor of a person ending up 
in prison Figure 6.D.
Data from the U.S. Departments of Justice and Education show that 85 
percent of all juveniles who come into the court system are functionally il-
literate; 60 percent of adult prison inmates are also illiterate.
At the global level, illiteracy is a particular problem for women  
(Figure 6.E). Of the 776 million adults who are illiterate worldwide, two-
thirds are women. Achieving literacy is still a significant challenge for some 
of the world's peripheral countries where children don't stay in school 
long enough to secure basic reading and writing skills. Often girls never 
get any schooling at all and so lose out on the opportunity to establish 
basic literacy skills that would serve to improve their social and economic 
chances in life. This is because girls face discrimination and social stigma 
and are expected to take on care-giving duties and household responsi-
bilities rather than attend school.

Since you're probably already pretty familiar with American 
slang, slang from Britain may be interesting as the words are also 
in English, but they may not have migrated across the ocean to 
the United States. Words such as bare, cray, dench, and well jel 
are common slang among English teenagers. Bare means lots of 
or very or exceedingly, as in "he's got bare cash." Cray, somewhat 
obviously, is derived from crazy and is a cross-over from rappers 
Jayzee and Kanye West. In England its use is really popular. And 
a return word from England to the United States, thanks to rapper 
Lethal Bizzle, is dench, meaning "remarkably good" in homage to 
Judi Dench, the acclaimed  British actress. Well jel means very jeal-
ous, in a positive sort of way, as in when someone has a great new 
pair of jeans and her complimenting friend says, "I'm well jel!"
It's not only youth who create slang. Here are some slang 
words that were introduced through classic literature from 
Dickens to Shakespeare that are not only still in use today but 
are also quite popular. Included in the short list is the author 
and the date of first appearance:
■ high (as in under the influence of drugs or alcohol, Thomas 
May, 1627)
■ hang out (to spend time with, Charles Dickens, 1836)
■ crib (as in dwelling place, William Shakespeare, 1623)
■ unfriend (the severing of a friendship, Thomas Fuller, 
1659).
Vocal Fry It's not just words, however, that characterize 
youth language use. Vocal fry is the practice of speaking in the 
lowest voice register to produce a popping or creaky sound at a 
very low frequency. It is a voice pattern that characterizes how 
many college-age U.S. women, currently speak. Vocal fry oc-
curs at the end of sentences and can be almost indiscernible to 
the uninitiated. Among other young people, however, this slow 
fluttering of the voice at the end of a sentence producing a kind 
of rattling sound is widely recognized and appreciated. If you 
don't know what it sounds like, listen to Kim Kardashian or 
Zooey Deschanel on an audio file.
Vocal fry communicates hipness to a wider like-minded 
group of young women; to potential employers it signals some-
thing else. Research is now showing that women who practice 
vocal fry—which until recently was considered a voice disor-
der—are passed over for jobs. In a 2014 study, employers indi-
cated they were less likely to say they'd want to hire the person 
with the fry voice, mostly because they found them to be less 
trustworthy. When making hiring judgments, employers pre-
ferred a normal voice 86 percent of the time for female speakers.
Language of Social Media
Social media is among the most powerful forces in com-
munication today. It is most widely used by young people,  
allowing them to convey messages instantly across a wide 
collection of "friends," fans, and others—from businesses 
to universities to people in situations of strife or conflict—
letting them know what is happening where they are. It is 
well known that social media as a communication mecha-
nism has affected, at a very basic level, words and sentence 
construction. But geographers are also interested in who 
uses it, where they are, and in what ways they are using it.  
Figure 6.14 is a map of which countries use which social net-
works and how many registered users are there.

dominates Russia, and Qzone, which dominates China, where Facebook is less dominant.

CHAPTER 6   Language, Communication, and Belief    231
Communication is also a spatial practice that can take 
place at a distance or in close proximity. A letter operates at 
a distance while a one-to-one conversation is immediate.  
Figure 6.15 depicts the different levels of intimacy involved in 
today's communication universe. What is missing from this 
graphic, however, are nonverbal forms of communication that, 
without a doubt, convey a language all their own.
Sign Language
Nonverbal signals account for two-thirds of all human commu-
nication. This shouldn't be surprising as the aphorism "actions 
speak louder than words" must surely indicate. But what if 
someone communicated with you using only body signals and 
eye contact? There is a branch of research that studies the ways 
tacit signals like these can be traced back to behaviors that were 
once critical for human survival. What's interesting about these 
facial and body language signals—pursed lips, crossed arms, an 
averted gaze—is that we still employ them today, largely sub-
consciously. Importantly, these signals can be read by others.
Researchers believe that our subconscious minds may 
register all sorts of information that our conscious minds do 
not access or no longer know what to do with. The television 
drama "Lie to Me" is premised on body and facial language 
with its chief protagonists being experts at reading human sub-
conscious communication with respect to truth, fear, shame, 
surprise, sadness, anger, and other emotions. The show is 
based on the work of a practicing clinical psychologist who is 
himself a leading expert on lie detection. As in the show, he 
observes the facial expressions and bodily gestures and posture 
to determine when someone is lying. His research indicates 
that our facial expressions are innate and impossible to con-
ceal. We communicate these micro-expressions of the language 
of emotion while not being aware that we're doing so.
Sensual language
There are also cultures that have no written form of communi-
cation and so, in addition to the spoken word, express them-
selves in other ways, often through art, song, and dance. For 
example, the Aboriginal people of Australia map their land-
scapes through painting, dance, and traditional songs. These 
are also known as songlines or dreaming tracks; a knowledge-
able person can traverse land by repeating the words of a par-
ticular song and thus locate the landmarks and other natural 
sites that are described in the song. And by singing the songs 
sequentially, the Aboriginal people are able to move easily 
across vast distances in the Australian interior.
Art, and not just Aboriginal art, is also a form of communi-
cation as are dance and music. Each form contains symbols or 
elements meant to tell the viewer something about the perfor-
mance or artwork. The modern Russian ballet, Swan Lake, for 
example, is as full of symbolism, body language, and commu-
nication as the Aboriginal songlines, so long as you understand 
the language of classical music and ballet.
Music and dance are special forms of language communi-
cation because they have the power to move us in conscious 
and subconscious ways. Think of the songs you love that make 
you want to dance, or the anthems that energize soldiers to go 
into battle. Music therapy among Alzheimer's patients has been 
successful in enabling middle- to late-stage cases—where lan-
guage has deteriorated and patients are heading into speech-
lessness—to begin to communicate again through singing.
APPLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE
1. List three examples of nonverbal communication used around the 
world. How important is nonverbal communication in social rela-
tions? Why do you think we often inflate the importance of words 
over other ways of communicating?
2. Consult the English dictionary and draw up a list of words that 
have been included in the last five years. Trace the geographi-
cal roots of these words. Examine how languages have devel-
oped and diffused through social exchanges and interactions, 
and discuss whether terms and languages that have developed 
on social media will evolve faster than other forms of using or 
writing language.

RELIGIOUS GEOGRAPHIES
Religions are belief systems and sets of practices that incor-
porate the idea of a power higher than humans. When belief 
systems and associated rituals are systematically arranged and 
formally established, they are referred to as organized reli-
gions. Although religious affiliation is on the decline in some 
parts of the world's core regions, religious beliefs are intensify-
ing in other parts of the world, working as a powerful shaper of 
daily life, from eating habits and dress codes to coming-of-age 
rituals and death ceremonies. And, like language, religious be-
liefs and practices change as new interpretations are advanced 
or new spiritual influences are adopted.
Global Distribution of the World's 
Religions
The most important influence on religious change has been 
conversion from one set of beliefs to another. From the Arab 
invasions following Muhammad's death in 632, to the Chris-
tian Crusades of the Middle Ages, to the onset of globalization 
in the fifteenth century, religious missionizing—propagandiz-
ing and persuasion—as well as forceful and sometimes violent 
conversion have been key elements in changing geographies 
of religion. Especially in the 500 years since the onset of the 
Columbian Exchange (see Chapter 4), conversion of all sorts 
has escalated throughout the globe. Since 1492, traditional 
religions have become dramatically dislocated from their sites 
of origin: not only through missionizing and conversion but 
also by way of diaspora and emigration. Whereas missioniz-
ing and conversion are deliberate efforts to change the religious 
views of a person or peoples, diaspora and emigration involve 
the involuntary and voluntary movement of peoples who bring 
their religious beliefs and practices to their new locales.
Migration and Religion
Diaspora is the spatial dispersion of a previously homoge-
neous group. The processes of global political and economic 
change that led to the massive movement of the world's pop-
ulations over the past five centuries have also meant the dis-
lodging and spread of the world's many religions from their 
traditional sites of practice. Religious practices have become 
so spatially mixed that it is a challenge to present a map of the 
contemporary global distribution of religion that reveals more 
than it obscures. This is because the globe is too gross a level 
of resolution to portray the wide variation that exists among 
and within religious practices. Figure 6.16 identifies the con-
temporary distribution of what religious scholars consider to 
be the world's major religions because they contain the largest 
number of adherents. As with other global representations, the 
map is useful in that it helps to present a generalized picture.
Figure 6.17 identifies the source areas of four of the world's 
major religions and their diffusion from those sites over time.

CHAPTER 6   Language, Communication, and Belief    233
The map illustrates how the world's major religions origi-
nated and diffused from two fairly small areas of the globe. 
The first, where Hinduism and Buddhism (as well as Sikhism) 
originated, is an area of lowlands in the subcontinent of India 
drained by the Indus and Ganges rivers (Punjab on the map). 
The second area, where Christianity and Islam (as well as  
Judaism) originated, is in the deserts of the Middle East.
Hinduism was the first religion to emerge, among the 
peoples of the Indo-Gangetic Plain, about 4,000 years ago. 
Buddhism and Sikhism evolved from Hinduism as reform reli-
gions, with Buddhism appearing around 500 b.C.E. and  Sikhism 
developing in the fifteenth century. It is not surprising that 
Hinduism helped to produce new religions because India has 
long been an important cultural crossroads. As a result, ideas 
and practices originating in India spread rapidly. At the same 
time, other ideas and practices were brought to India from far-
flung places and were absorbed and translated to reflect Indian 
needs and values.
For example, Buddhism emerged as a branch of Hinduism 
in an area not far from the Punjab. At first a very small group 
of practitioners surrounding Prince Siddhartha Gautama, 
the founder of the religion, were confined to northern India. 
Slowly and steadily Buddhism dispersed to other parts of In-
dia and was carried by missionaries and traders to China (100 
b.C.E.-200 C.E.), Korea and Japan (300-500 C.E.), Southeast Asia 
(400-600 C.E.), Tibet (700 C.E.), and Mongolia (1500 C.E.) (see 
Figure 6.18). And as Buddhism spread, it developed many re-
gional forms; Tibetan Buddhism, for example, is distinct from 
Japanese Buddhism.
The World's Major Religions
The world's most widespread religious belief systems are codi-
fied and institutionalized as organized religions. Nevertheless, 
it is important to recognize that each of the world's religions 
contains all sorts of variation. For example, Christians may be 
Catholics or Protestants, and even within these large groups 
there exists a great deal of variation.
Hinduism, the oldest religion, is codified in the Veda and 
the Upanishads, its sacred scriptures, but Hinduism is a term 
that broadly describes a wide array of sects. Hindus strive, 
through the practice of yoga, adherence to Vedic scriptures, 
and devotion to a personal guru, for release from repeated rein-
carnation. Hinduism's most central deities are the divine trin-
ity, representing the cyclical nature of the universe: Brahma 
the creator, Vishnu the preserver, and Shiva the destroyer.
An offshoot of Hinduism, Buddhism was founded by Gau-
tama—known as the Buddha (Enlightened One)—in southern 
Nepal. The central tenets of Buddhism are that meditation and 
the practice of good religious and moral behavior can lead to 
nirvana, the state of enlightenment. Before reaching nirvana, 
however, one must experience repeated lifetimes that are good 
or bad depending on one's actions (karma). There are four no-
ble truths in Buddhism: (1) existence is a realm of suffering; 
(2) desire, along with the belief in the importance of one's self, 
causes suffering; (3) achievement of nirvana ends suffering; 
and (4) nirvana is attained only by meditation and by following 
the path of righteousness.
Like Hinduism and Buddhism, Sikhism advocates the pur-
suit of salvation through disciplined, personal meditation in

◀ Figure 6.17 Origin areas and 
 diffusion of four major religions The 
world's major religions originated in a 
fairly small region of the world. Judaism 
and Christianity began in present-day 
Israel and Jordan. Islam emerged from 
western Arabia. Buddhism originated in 
India, and Hinduism in the Indus region 
of Pakistan. The source areas of the 
world's major religions are also the cul-
tural hearth areas of agriculture, urban-
ization, and other key aspects of human 
development.

the name and message of God, who is regarded not as a person 
but as the Universe itself.
Christianity, Islam, and Judaism all developed among the 
Semitic-speaking people of the deserts of the Middle East. And 
like the Indo-Gangetic religions, these three religions are re-
lated. Although Judaism is the oldest of the three, it is the least 
widespread. Judaism originated about 4,000 years ago, Christi-
anity about 2,000 years ago, and Islam about 1,300 years ago. 
Judaism developed out of the cultures and beliefs of Bronze 
Age peoples and was the first monotheistic (belief in one God) 
religion. Although Judaism is the oldest monotheistic religion, 
and one that spread widely and rapidly, it is numerically small 
because it does not seek converts.
Christians and Jews, along with Muslims and Bahá'í and 
Druze followers, share the same source as Abrahamic religions, 
which means that they all claim a strong connection to the 
prophet Abraham and the source area of the Middle East. Al-
though sharing the same origin, Judaism is also based on the 
teachings of the prophets Isaac and Jacob as well as Abraham. 
Jews espouse belief in a God who leads his people by speaking 
through these prophets. They believe that God's word is re-
vealed in the Hebrew Bible (or Old Testament), especially in 
that part known as the Torah, which contains a total of 613 
biblical commandments, including the Ten Commandments, 
explicated in another part of the Hebrew Bible known as the 
Talmud. Jews believe that the human condition can be im-
proved, that the letter and the spirit of the Torah must be fol-
lowed, and that a Messiah will eventually bring the world to a 
state of paradise.
Christianity developed in Jerusalem among the disciples 
of Jesus of Nazareth, who announced that he was the Messiah  
expected by the Jews. The religion is based on the life and 
teachings of Jesus as written up by various authors in the New 
Testament of the Christian Bible. It is the world's largest re-
ligion, with 1 to 2 billion adherents. Christians believe that 
Jesus was the son of God and the Messiah prophesied in the 
Old Testament, a scripture that is also significant to Judaism. 
As a central figure in all Christian religions, Jesus is revered 
as a teacher, the model of a pious life, the manifestation of 
God, and most importantly a savior of humanity who suffered,

died, and was resurrected to bring about 
human salvation from sin. Christians be-
lieve that upon his death, Jesus ascended 
into heaven; that at some point he will 
return to judge the living and the dead; 
and that he will grant life everlasting to 
those who have followed his teachings. As 
Christianity moved east and south from 
its hearth area, its diffusion was advanced 
by missionizing and by imperial sponsor-
ship and military crusades. The diffusion 
of Christianity in Europe is illustrated in 
Figure 6.19.
Islam is an Arabic term that means 
"submission," specifically submission 
to God's will. A Muslim is a member of 
the community of believers whose duty 
is obedience and submission to the will 
of God. Islam recognizes the prophets of 
the Old and New Testaments of the Chris-
tian Bible, but to Muslims, Muhammad is 
the last prophet and God's messenger on 
Earth. The Qur'an, the principal holy book 
of the Muslims, is considered the word 
of God as revealed to Muhammad by the 
Angel Gabriel beginning in about 610 C.E. 
There are two fundamental sources of Is-
lamic doctrine and practice: the Qur'an 
and the Sunna. Muslims regard the Qur'an as communicated 
by God to Muhammad. The Sunna is not a written document 
but a set of practical guidelines to behavior. It is effectively 
a body of traditions that are derived from the words and ac-
tions of the Prophet Muhammad. Like Christianity, Islam was 
for centuries routinely spread by forced conversion, to save 
souls but also often for the purposes of political control. In-
evitably, adherents of the two religions have clashed, often at 
geographic flashpoints, and sometimes with bloody and vio-
lent results.

Established Churches and Religions The relationship 
between organized religions and states varies a great deal. 
The First Amendment US Constitution states that "Congress 
shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, 
or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." This separation of 
church and state is intended to ensure that individuals do 
not have to fear government interference in their manner of 
worship. There is a similar separation in other countries, 
including Australia, France, India, and Singapore. In con-
trast, some countries have established churches: recognized 
by law as the official church of the state. Catholicism, for ex-
ample, is the official religion in Argentina and Costa Rica, 
the Eastern Orthodox Church of Greece in Greece, the An-
glican Church of England in the United Kingdom, and so on. 
Similarly, many Muslim-majority countries have established 
a specific form of Islam as a state religion: Sunni Islam in 
Afghanistan, Malaysia, and Saudi Arabia, for example, and 
Shi'a Islam in Iran.
Church and State in England The influence of estab-
lished churches and state religions often carries important 
implications for many aspects of life and can have all sorts 
of geographic implications and outcomes. In the United 
Kingdom, for example, 26 bishops of the established Church 
of England—the "Lords Spiritual"—sit in parliament's un-
elected upper chamber, the House of Lords. They are now 
a minority in the House of Lords, but at one time bishops, 
archbishops, and abbots were a majority, and the House of 
Lords itself was much more powerful. As a result, the Church

◀ Figure 6.20 Cross Bones burial 
grounds in Southwark, London The 
repository for thousands of deceased 
prostitutes, most of whom had operated  
under license to the Bishops of Winchester. 
In the nineteenth century, Cross Bones 
became the haunt of body- snatchers 
seeking specimens for the anatomy classes 
at nearby Guy's Hospital. The burial 
ground was finally closed in 1853 as it was 
"completely overcharged with dead" and 
a danger to public health. The railings 
have become an impromptu memorial, 
adorned with messages and mementoes, 
ribbons, flowers, and other totems.
▲ Figure 6.21 Planted church In 1711 Parliament had passed an Act  
for Building Fifty New Churches across London: part of a Tory strategy to 
maintain the Church of England as an arm of the state. The Act allocated 
money from the Coal Tax to the commission for Building Fifty New Churches, 
and the commission's design guidelines laid stress on imposing exteriors and 
impressive entrances for the new churches. Only 12 churches were ever  
built under the Act—Christ Church was one of them. The architect was 
Nicholas Hawksmoor.
and its leadership acquired a great deal of power, wealth, 
and influence. In medieval England, for example, parts of 
many of the bishoprics (the territories under the leadership 
of a bishop) functioned as civil jurisdictions with legal pow-
ers. Sometimes this led to exploitation. For several centuries 
the Bishops of Winchester enriched themselves by licensing 
prostitutes in the part of south London that they controlled. 
The bishops nevertheless did not allow the women to be bur-
ied on consecrated ground. Prostitutes ended up in Cross 
Bones burial grounds (Figure 6.20), along with paupers and 
other unlicensed sinners.
In the eighteenth century, the influence of the established 
Church was imprinted on the townscape and social geography 
of London as parliament passed a succession of Acts to pay 
for new churches. Worried that the population of the rapidly 
growing city was becoming increasingly nonconformist, and 
with an influx of migrants with different religious affiliations, 
Parliament sought to secure London's burgeoning suburbs for 
the established Church by dominating new neighborhoods 
with impressive Anglican churches (Figure 6.21).
Islam as a State Religion Where Islam is the state religion, 
various interpretations of sharia law—based directly on pre-
cepts set forth in the Qur'an and the Sunna—control not only 
people's private comportment but also their public behavior, 
including their dress, diet, education, and entertainment. As a 
result, sharia law is a fundamental influence on the economic, 
social, cultural, and political geographies of Islamic countries. 
As we shall see in Chapter 12, for example, Islam's emphasis 
on personal privacy and virtue, on communal well-being, and 
on the inner essence of things rather than on their outward ap-
pearance has shaped the layout and design of traditional Is-
lamic cities.
Sharia is one aspect of religious law that dictates the prac-
tices and behaviors of its adherents. Box 6.3: "Visualizing

on Behavior" provides a wider view of the 
ways that religion shape human behaviors as 
well as spirituality.
Religiosity
It is important to remember that not everyone 
adheres to a religious faith of any kind, orga-
nized or otherwise. Globally, an estimated 18 
percent of the population is unaffiliated with 
any religion. There is, however, a great deal of 
variation. Surveys have shown that in many 
countries a majority of people say that they 
believe there is a god and that religion is im-
portant in their personal lives. Religiosity is 
highest in countries like Indonesia, Tanzania,  
Pakistan, and Nigeria, where more than 
90 percent of the population believe there 
is a god and say that religion is important 
to them. In contrast, barely half of the citi-
zens of the European Union believe there is 
a god. Fewer than 30 percent of the popu-
lation in Denmark, France, and the Neth-
erlands believe there is a god, while in the 
Czech Republic, Estonia, and Sweden the figure is less than 
20 percent (Figure 6.22). Within each country there is also a 
great deal of variation by region and even by neighborhood 
in the same city. Data from the United Kingdom's census of 
2011, for example, show that in some districts in London, 
fewer than 10 percent of the population have no religion 
while in others the figure exceeds 40 percent (Figure 6.23).  
Similar variations exist across other UK cities.

6.1 Government Restrictions on Religion Around the World
When governments codify religious beliefs into state laws, these restrictions evolve into laws, enforceable by the state. For example, on 
Shabbat in Israel, all business and public transportation is shut down in observation of the holy day. Moreover, states that adhere to one 
form of beliefs can vilify or outlaw other religions, making practices adhered to by followers a social taboo or even illegal. Secular states, 
like many in Western Europe, restrict religious expression in spaces that are considered state spaces.
Figure  6.1.1 Government religious restrictions around the world

Religions and belief systems can place restrictions on human behavior including diet, sexual behavior, gender roles, educa-
tion, speech and health care. For example, Christians promote abstinence until marriage, which are monogamous, hetero-
sexual unions. All of the major world religions—Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism—have strong ideas 
about menstruation and its "negative effect" on women, leading to prohibitions of physical intimacy, cooking, attending places 
of worship, and even having women live separately from men at that time (http://ispub.com/IJWH/5/2/8213). The followers of 
these different belief systems choose to participate in these beliefs, based on personal choice or cultural inﬂuences.

Overall, religiosity is decreasing in most of Europe. In 
the United Kingdom, for example, only 14 percent of respon-
dents to a 1963 Gallup Poll described themselves not believ-
ing in a god. But a poll undertaken in 2012 for the Church of  
England found that more than 40 percent of respondents 
identified themselves as not believing in a god. One outcome 
is that many of the country's churches stand empty, or have 
been sold off and converted to apartments, galleries, or cafes 
(Figure 6.24). In France, regular attendance at Mass was al-
ready down to less than 40 percent of the Catholic population 
in 1961 but is now down to less than 10 percent. In several 
European countries, a shortage of recruits to religious semi-
naries has meant that some communities have had to recruit 
priests from Africa or Latin America. On the other hand, reli-
giosity has been increasing in many Islamic countries (where 
it has always been high), Russia, and Eastern European coun-
tries since the fall of communism (where it had been very 
low), and in China since the relaxation of strict communist 
principles under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping in the 
1980s and 1990s.
Wealth and Religiosity Generally, religion plays a strong 
role in less-developed countries but a much less important 
role in the lives of individuals in high-income countries. A 
2008 survey of more than 24,000 individuals in 23 countries 
found a very strong negative correlation between the wealth 
of their country, measured in terms of standardized purchas-
ing power, and the percentage of people saying that religion 
is important to them (Figure 6.25). The clear exception to the 
overall pattern is the United States, which is a much more 
religious country than its degree of prosperity would suggest. 
Despite its wealth, the United States is in the middle of the 
global pack when it comes to the importance of religion. In-
deed, on this question, the United States is closer to consider-
ably less-developed nations such as India and Brazil than to 
other Western countries.
It is a matter of speculation as to why this may be so. Some 
observers suggest that it is because Americans feel far less secure 
in terms of their personal well-being than would be expected 
given the overall wealth of the country. Other wealthy coun-
tries have established well-developed welfare states and more 
comprehensive health care systems that serve to redistribute 
wealth and provide a safety net for the poor, reducing feelings 
of insecurity and anxiety that, it is argued, often provide a fertile 
ground for religion. Nevertheless, the cultural exceptionalism of 
the United States, together with its distinctive demographic pro-
file and relatively brief history, means that there are many other 
factors that may explain the country's religiosity.
APPLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE
1. How are religions getting transformed with the advent of newer 
and faster forms of communication that facilitate their spread? In 
a multicultural world, will we have more uniform and standardized 
forms of religion, and thereby more homogenous cultures, or will 
different forms of religions coexist?
2. Is there a relationship between wealth and religion in your coun-
try?  Is religion practiced differently in public and private life? If 
so, what role does religion play in the public sphere?
Other Belief Systems
Along with the adherents of the world's major religions and 
the hundreds of millions of atheists and agnostics around the 
world, there are many others with quite different belief sys-
tems. Among them are animism, Confucianism, Taoism, Shin-
toism, Mormonism, Zoroastrianism, and Jansenism, as well as 
Voodoo, Wicca, Rastafarianism, and Scientology, created by 
science-fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard. In addition, most so-
cial systems generate cults: systems of veneration and devo-
tion among a relatively small group of people having beliefs 
or practices regarded by outsiders as weird or sinister, or, at

least, weirder than some of the belief systems that are legally 
accepted as religions. One of the best-known examples of a cult 
from the United States was the People's Temple, widely pub-
licized because of the mass suicide of 913 of its members who 
drank Kool-Aid laced with poison in their Jonestown, Guyana, 
settlement in 1978.
But more significant than the small and ephemeral 
cults that characterize modern societies are the legacies 
of traditional belief systems and mythologies: grand nar-
ratives that helped to give life meaning and that helped 
people make sense of the world. Many of them once had 
the standing of a religion before being eclipsed by the 
missionizing of Christianity or Islam. While no longer re-
garded as religions, their legacy is often an important part 
of people's cultural heritage and identity. A good example 
is Norse mythology, associated with the Vikings of Scandi-
navia and Denmark and the Germanic peoples of Northern 
Europe between 800 and 1000 C.E. Norse mythology was 
a highly sophisticated and complex amalgam of gods, god-
desses, giants, poems, and sagas. While few Norwegians, 
Swedes, or Danes may believe today in the existence of a 
warrior-god Thor; of Freya, the goddess of beauty and fer-
tility; of elves; or of trolls (Figure 6.26), Norse mythology 
is a significant element of Scandinavian folk culture and 
contemporary landscapes, place names, literature, and 
cultural identity.
GLOBALIZATION, 
COMMUNICATION, AND RELIGION
Changing geographies of belief systems are a significant 
outcome of globalization. As disparate belief systems come 
into contact, in some cases causing tension and even violent 
conflict, new religions are introduced among populations 
dominated by adherents of a different one. An 
excellent illustration of the global forces behind 
the changing geography of religious faith is the 
Columbian contact with the New World. Before 
Columbus and later Europeans reached the con-
tinents of North and South America, the people 
living there practiced, for the most part, various 
forms of animism and related rituals. They viewed 
themselves holistically, as one part of the wider 
world of animate and inanimate nature. Shaman-
ism, in which spiritually gifted individuals are 
believed to possess the power to control preter-
natural forces, is one important aspect of the 
belief system that existed among Native Ameri-
can populations at the time of European contact 
 (Figure 6.27).
Cargo cults are another example of the impact 
of modernity and globalization on traditional be-
lief systems. Cargo cults involve the belief that 
certain ritualistic acts will lead to a bestowing of 
material wealth ("cargo"). They are chiefly associ-
ated with the Melanesian Islanders of the Pacific 
Ocean, where traditional societies were disrupted 
by the arrival during World War II of military forces—first 
Japanese, then American—with their aircraft, equipment, 
food, soft drinks, and cigarettes. After the military bases 
closed and the personnel departed, some charismatic leaders 
on remote Melanesian Islands sought to lure back the out-
siders' goods by carving model aircraft and jeeps, lighting 
signal flares, and performing parade-ground style drills with 
wooden rifles.

▲ Figure 6.27 San Xavier del Bac Mission near Tucson, Arizona The 
influence of missionaries on native populations was profound, as indigenous

HUMAN GEOGRAPHY   Places and Regions in Global Context
Perhaps what is most interesting about recent trends in 
the geography of religion is how during the colonial period re-
ligious missionizing and conversion flowed from the core to 
the periphery. In the postcolonial period, however, an opposite 
trend has occurred. For example, the fastest-growing religion in 
the United States today is Islam, and it is in the core countries 
where Buddhism is making the greatest numbers of converts. 
Recent Popes have been the most widely traveled leaders in 
Roman Catholic history. And the same can be said for the Dalai 
Lama, who, as the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhists and 
the head of the Tibetan government-in-exile, has been a tireless 
world traveler. The Popes' efforts have been mostly directed at 
maintaining Roman Catholic followers and attempting to dis-
suade their conversion to other religions, such as evangelical-
ism in the United States and Latin America. The Dalai Lama 
promotes conversion to Buddhism; he carries its message to 
new places, especially in the core, and advocates sovereignty 
for Tibet, a region once independent but currently controlled 
by China.
The Influence of Modern 
Communications
Another impact of globalization upon religious change oc-
curs through the electronic media. One example is the rise 
of television evangelism, or televangelism, which has led to 
the conversion of large numbers of people to Christian fun-
damentalism, a term popularly used to describe strict adher-
ence to Christian doctrines based on a literal interpretation 
of the Bible. Christian televangelism is well established in 
the United States and also widespread in other countries, 
including Brazil, Argentina, and Chile, as well as India, Ke-
nya, and China. (And Muslim televangelism is just begin-
ning to emerge.) The Christian reference to fundamentalism 
derives from a late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century 
transdenominational Protestant movement that opposed the 
accommodation of Christian doctrine to modern scientific 
knowledge, especially concerning origin and evolution of life 
on Earth. It began with the publication of a series of pam-
phlets between 1910 and 1915 entitled "The Fundamentals: 
A Testimony to the Truth."
Today, Christian fundamentalism is growing stronger 
in the United States with megachurches becoming popular 
sites of worship (Figure 6.28). The conventional definition of 
a megachurch involves Protestant congregations that share 
several distinctive characteristics: 2,000 or more persons in 
attendance at weekly worship, a charismatic senior minis-
ter, a 7-day-a-week congregational community, and multiple 
social and outreach activities. In 1970 there were about ten 
such churches in the United States; by 2014 there were more 
than 1,650. They have been called the "soul of the exurbs" 
and it is certainly the case that the most sprawling metro-
politan regions—in the South, Southwest, and West—have

There are about 1,300 such churches in the United States.

6.4 Window on the World
In the Netherlands, Islamic fashion researcher Annelies Moors explored 
the trend of young women, children of immigrant guest workers, moving 
toward wearing headscarves. Though it is important to appreciate that not 
all Muslim women wear headscarves, these young women, who are usually 
better educated than their mothers, have taken an interest in Islamic dress 
in response to an increasing commitment to their religion. In exploring this 
phenomenon, Moors interviewed three Muslim women to understand 
their reasons for these choices. It should be appreciated that while all the 
women identify as Muslim and are recognizable as such by their dress, 
their outfits are distinctive, reflecting their personal differences.
Feride (who is in her mid-thirties and is the daughter of working-class Turkish im-
migrant parents) is most comfortable in elegant suits, combinations of floor-length 
skirts and well-cut jackets of high-quality materials, often brought from Turkey.
Lisa (a 22-year-old college student whose father is from Pakistan and mother 
is a Hindu from Suriname, who converted to Islam) describes her style as casual, 
sporty, urban, and cool. She usually wears jeans with a tunic or a blouse over them 
(a headscarf), and "always a hoodie, combined with a cool bag and Nikes."
Malika (a 24-year-old college student whose parents were Moroccan im-
migrants) wears an outfit that shows the least variety. She wears a long, loose, 
all-covering dress, made by a seamstress who specializes in such outfits, and 
combines this with a three-quarter-length, all-enveloping veil (khimar); some-
times she also wears gloves. Underneath, however, she wears very fashionable 
styles, including brand-name jeans.
Although Feride considers herself very much a religious person, she also 
explained that she had to grow into wearing these styles of covered dress. 
"You have your own personal taste, and also fashion plays a role. If long splits 
are fashionable, you buy skirts with long splits. ... Covering is a form of wor-
ship, and you are not really supposed to draw attention to yourself or to make 
yourself beautiful. That is a thin line."
Malika began wearing her veil almost a year ago. Although to an outsider 
this shift in clothing may look like a huge change, she said, "I do not think it is 
that much of a change. I still love fashion, but now it is halal [permissible ac-
cording to Islamic law]. I simply wear a long dress over my jeans. Sometimes 
people who know me from before say what a pity, all those curls, what hap-
pened, you were always so free. Then I say that was my appearance, but what 
you see is not the same as what is inside. I had always been practicing."
Lisa likes brand names: "G-Star, for instance. The quality is much better." 
She often goes to the smaller stores where they have different brands. "But 
for simple things, I go to Vero Moda or H&M." Thinking about what she 
finds Islamically acceptable, she says, "I would not say everything except 
the face and the hands, but I do cover my chest and the section between 
my waist and my knees. Also, it should not be too tight or too short. If 
I wear skirts, it is a long skirt, or I wear trousers underneath. I wear such 
styles with my headscarf, because of [my] love for God. It is not that it 
makes you less attractive, because your eyes or your face can also do that."
The stories these very different women tell about themselves and their 
personal choices indicate that traditional cultural traits, such as dressing the 
female body consistent with religious strictures, are never static but vary, even 
within the same location (Figure 6.F).

Reaction: Islam and Cultural Nationalism
Through the media of film and television, many aspects of U.S. 
culture travel widely outside its borders. Although many of 
these are welcomed abroad, many others are not. France, for 
example, has been fighting for years against the "Americaniza-
tion" of its language, food, and films. Nations can respond to 
the homogenizing forces of globalization and the spread of U.S. 
culture in any number of ways. Some groups attempt to seal 
themselves off from undesirable influences. Other groups at-
tempt to legislate the flow of foreign ideas and values. Most re-
cently, Muslim countries have been especially resistant to the 
effects of Western culture propelled by globalization on their 
beliefs and practices. The movement, known as cultural na-
tionalism, is an effort to protect regional and national cultures 
from the homogenizing impact of globalization, especially from  
the penetrating influence of U.S. culture.
The Islamic world includes very different societies and re-
gions, from Southeast Asia to Africa. Muslims comprise over 
85 percent of the populations of Afghanistan, Algeria, Ban-
gladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Pakistan, Saudi 
Arabia, Senegal, Tunisia, Turkey, and most of the independent 
republics of central Asia and the Caucasus (including Azer-
baijan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan). In Albania, 
Chad, Ethiopia, and Nigeria, Muslims make up 50 to 85 per-
cent of the population. In India, Burma (Myanmar), Cambodia, 
China, Greece, Slovenia, Thailand, and the Philippines, sig-
nificant Muslim minorities exist. After Christianity, Islam pos-
sesses the next largest number of adherents worldwide—about 
1 billion. The map in Figure 6.29 shows the relative distribu-
tion of Muslims throughout Europe, Africa, and Asia as well as 
the heartland of Islamic religious practice.
One of the most widespread cultural forces in the world 
today is Islamism, more popularly, although incorrectly, 
known as Islamic fundamentalism. Whereas fundamentalism 
is a general term that describes the desire to return to strict ad-
herence to the fundamentals of a religious system, Islamism is 
an anticolonial, anti-imperial political movement. In Muslim 
countries, Islamists resist core, especially Western, forces of 
globalization—namely modernization and secularization. Not 
all Muslims are Islamists, although Islamism is the most mili-
tant movement within Islam today.
The basic intent of Islamism is to create a model of soci-
ety that protects the purity and centrality of Islamic precepts 
through the return to a universal Islamic state—a state that 
would be religiously and politically unified. Islamists object to 
modernization because they believe the corrupting influences 
of the core place the rights of the individual over the common 
good. They view the popularity of Western ideas as a move 
away from religion to a more secular (nonreligious) society. Is-
lamists desire to maintain religious precepts at the center of 
state actions, such as introducing principles from the sacred 
law of Islam into state constitutions.
Islamism—a radical and sometimes militant movement—
should not be regarded as synonymous with the practices of 
Islam, any more generally than Christian fundamentalism is 
with Christianity. Islam is not a monolithic religion, and even 
the most megachurches. Megachurch facilities are typically 
designed to draw in every aspect of life, with an active pres-
ence in social media, round-the-clock activities that include 
aerobics classes, social services, fast food, bowling alleys, 
sports teams, aquatic centers with Christian themes, multi-
media bible classes, and customized apps that provide ser-
mon notes, sermon audio, and listings of the church calendar 
and events.
While communication technologies, mass media, and 
social media can accelerate missionizing and reinforce reli-
gious precepts, they can also work in the opposite direction. 
Movies, TV shows, music, and the Internet rapidly spread 
trends and fashions around the globe, and some of them, in-
evitably, clash with the traditions and interpretations of one 
religion or another. In some cases, religious traditions are 
compromised. In others, they can be modified. Take, for ex-
ample, the tradition of Muslim women wearing headscarves 
or veils when they are out in public. The Muslim holy book, 
the Qur'an, instructs them, as well as men, to be modest in 
their public comportment. Some Muslim women wear heads-
carves to demonstrate their piety and publicly identify them-
selves as people who adhere to Muslim religious beliefs. For 
them, covering one's head is an expression of religious con-
viction. But being religious doesn't mean a Muslim woman 
must also be unfashionable. And just because many Mus-
lim women wear headscarves (or other forms of more mod-
est dress such as full-length skirts and long sleeves) does 
not mean that they all dress the same. In fact, fashionable 
Muslim dress has grown increasingly popular (see Box 6.4: 
"Window on the World: Fashion Veiling").
Geographers Banu Gökariksel and Anna Secor have 
studied the veiling fashion industry in Turkey, a particularly 
interesting place to explore because of the over 200 firms 
operating there. With retail outlets in the Middle East, Eu-
rope, Asia, and North America, these firms clearly have a 
global reach.
Turkish veiling-fashion designers visit the annual fashion 
shows in Paris to find inspiration for their new styles in emerg-
ing Western trends of fabric, color, cut, and style. Veiling- 
fashion is little different from Western fashion in that it is part 
of a larger system of production, consumption, and changing 
cultural tastes.

though all adherents accept the basic pillars of the faith, spe-
cific practices vary according to the different histories of coun-
tries, nations, and tribes. Some expressions of Islam allow for 
the existence and integration of Western styles of dress, food, 
music, and other aspects of culture, while others call for the

RELIGION AND LANDSCAPE
The long-standing power of organized religions and estab-
lished churches, together with the importance of religion in 
many people's lives, means that religion has been an impor-
tant shaper of landscape in almost every part of the world. The 
most obvious examples, perhaps, are the cathedrals, churches, 
mosques, and temples that in many cases stand out in high re-
lief amid their immediate surroundings (Figure 6.30). Less vis-
ible, but even more influential in shaping many of the world's 
landscapes, are the land holdings and investments of religious 
institutions. The Catholic Church, for example, owns not only 
the 110 acres of land in the middle of Rome that constitutes 
the Vatican City but also roughly 177 million more acres of 
property—agricultural, residential, and commercial, as well 
as ecclesiastical—around the world. The Catholic Church is 
also the wealthiest single institution in the world, with an es-
timated U.S.$150 billion in annual spending, investment, and

▲ Figure 6.29 Muslim world Like the Spanish colonial effort, the rise and growth of Muslim colonization were accompanied by the diffusion of the colonizers' 
religion. The distribution of Islam in Africa, Southeast Asia, and South Asia that we see today testifies to the broad reach of Muslim cultural, colonial, and trade 
activities. But the heart of the Muslim culture remains the Middle East, the original cultural hearth. It is also in this area that Islamism is most militant.

lobbying. The impact of that level of expenditure on local land-
scapes and human geographies is significant. In the United 
States, most of the expenditure is directed toward health care 
and to Catholic colleges and universities.
In the United Kingdom, the established church has prop-
erty and investment assets worth more than £5.3 billion 
(U.S.$9 billion), including a huge "shoppertainment" center 
in northern England and industrial parks, residential estates, 
and vacant land temporarily converted to parking lots in 
many cities. In the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, 
the Church had much more land in London, and grew rich 
on the rents of its tenants. Much of the housing owned by

exceptional degree of architectural and urban design control.
the Church, however, was substandard, and the Ecclesiasti-
cal Commissioners of the Church attracted widespread criti-
cism for deriving so much of their profits from impoverished 
tenants. When the railways needed to purchase land to bring 
their tracks and termini to central London in the 1840s, the 
commissioners were only too happy to rid themselves of the 
worst of their embarrassing slum properties while securing 
healthy compensation. Nevertheless, the Church remained 
one of the biggest "slumlords" in London into the mid-twen-
tieth century. In the 1960s the Ecclesiastical Commission-
ers sold off many of their slum properties, thereby removing 
at least some of the grounds for shame. At the same time it 
raised capital that the commissioners needed to enter into 
partnerships with property companies and begin the renova-
tion and rebuilding of its better-managed estates.
Without doubt the single most profound influence on  
London's landscapes and geography, however, dates from a 
much earlier time. Before the sixteenth-century Protestant 
Reformation that led to the eventual adoption of the Angli-
can Church as the established religion, the Catholic Church 
and its representatives owned a great deal of property in the 
city and huge tracts of land just beyond it. Before Henry VIII's 
Dissolution of the Monasteries, there had been 23 religious 
houses in the city itself, while beyond the walls was a ring of 
hospitals, abbeys, priories, convents, and ecclesiastical pal-
aces that effectively constituted a medieval green belt. Their 
confiscation by the Crown gave London room to grow, and 
the allocation of most of the undeveloped monastic land to 
a select group of courtiers was a windfall privatization that 
established London's Great Estates, which were later to be 
developed as the distinctive residential districts of London's 
West End (Figure 6.31).
Sacred Spaces and Pilgrimages
Sacred spaces are physical settings recognized by individuals 
or groups as worthy of special attention because they are the 
sites of special religious experiences and events. They do not 
occur naturally; rather, they are assigned sanctity through the 
values and belief systems of particular groups or individuals. 
Geographer Yi-Fu Tuan insists that what defines the sacred-
ness of a space goes beyond the obvious shrines and temples. 
Sacred spaces are those that rise above the commonplace and 
interrupt ordinary routine.
In almost all cases, sacred spaces are segregated, dedicated, 
and hallowed sites that are maintained as such generation af-
ter generation. Believers—including mystics, spiritualists, reli-
gious followers, and pilgrims—recognize sacred spaces as being 
endowed with divine meaning. The range of sacred spaces 
includes sites as different as an elegant and elaborate temple 
in Cambodia, Angkor Wat, sacred to Hindus (Figure 6.32), 
and the Black Hills of South Dakota, the sacred mountains of 
the Lakota Sioux.
Often, members of a specific religion are expected to jour-
ney to especially important sacred spaces to renew their faith 
or to demonstrate devotion. A pilgrimage is a journey to a 

CHAPTER 6   Language, Communication, and Belief    247
sacred space, and a pilgrim is a person who undertakes such 
a journey. In India many of the sacred pilgrimage sites for Hin-
dus are concentrated along the seven sacred rivers: the Gan-
ges, the Yamuna, the Saraswati, the Narmada, the Indus, the 
Cauvery, and the Godavari. The Ganges is India's holiest river, 
and many sacred sites are located along its banks (Figure 6.33). 
Hindus visit sacred pilgrimage sites for a variety of reasons, in-
cluding seeking a cure for sickness, washing away sins, and 
fulfilling a promise to a deity. Perhaps the most well-known 
pilgrimage is the hajj, the obligatory once-in-a-lifetime jour-
ney of Muslims to Mecca. For one month every year, the city 
of Mecca in Saudi Arabia swells from its base population of 
150,000 to over 1,000,000 as pilgrims from all over the world 
journey to fulfill their obligation to pray in the city and receive 
the grace of Allah. Figure 6.34 shows the principal countries 
that send pilgrims to Mecca.
◀ Figure 6.32 Angkor Wat, Cambodia Built for the 
King Suryavarman II in the early twelfth century, Angor 
Wat was dedicated to the Hindu god Vishnu. In the late 
thirteenth century, this state temple became a sacred 
site for Buddhists, which continues to this day.

▲ Figure 6.34 Source areas for pilgrims to Mecca Islam requires that every adult Muslim perform the pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in a lifetime. This 
obligation is deferred for four groups of people: those who cannot afford to make the pilgrimage; those who are constrained by physical disability, hazardous 
conditions, or political barriers; slaves and those of unsound mind; and women without a husband or male relative to accompany them. The pattern of actual 
pilgrimages to Mecca (which is located close to the Red Sea coast in Saudi Arabia) suggests a fairly strong distance-decay effect, with most traveling relatively 
short distances from Middle Eastern Arab countries. More distant source areas generally provide smaller numbers of pilgrims, though Indonesia and Malaysia are 
notable exceptions.
(Source: After C. C. Park, Sacred Worlds. London: Routledge, 1994, p. 268.)
Pilgrimages to sacred sites are made all over the world, 
 including Christian Europe. The most visited sacred site in 
 Europe is Lourdes, at the base of the Pyrenees in southwest 
France, not far from the Spanish border (Figure 6.35). Another 
sacred site that attracts pilgrims throughout the world is the 
city of Jerusalem, and the Holy Land more generally, which 
is visited by Jews, Orthodox, Catholics, Protestants, Christian 
Zionists, and followers of many other religions. Jerusalem 
certainly has few rivals for the title of the most sacred city in 
the world, possessing as it does an unmatched Christian, Jew-
ish, and Islamic history. The history and the map of the city 
reflect the histories of the various empires that dominated 
and were succeeded by new and yet more powerful empires 
(Figure 6.36).
After the break-up of the Ottoman Empire in the aftermath 
of World War I, a Mandate for Palestine was established by the 
League of Nations, whereby Palestine would become a Protec-
torate, administered by Britain, that would include a home for 
the Jewish people. British policy was that Jerusalem should be 
an international city with no one state claiming it as entirely 
its own. The creation of Israel as a national state in 1949 put an 
end to that policy. Today, Jerusalem is a highly contested city 
as Palestinians, Christians, Muslims, and Jews fight for control 
of it. Nationalist Israelis maintain that Jerusalem will be the 
"eternal and undivided capital" of Israel, while Palestinians 
believe that Jerusalem should be the future capital of the Pal-
estinian state. Peace accords agreed in Oslo, Norway, in 1992 
led to a joint declaration that hinted at the possibility of nego-
tiating the future of Jerusalem. But despite further negotiations 
in subsequent years, Jerusalem remains entirely controlled by 
Israel, with little prospect of a just and peaceful resolution of 
the issue.
An example of the ongoing contest for control is the con-
tinuing dispute over the Dome of the Rock, which was con-
structed between 688 and 691 C.E. Muslims claim the Dome 
as a asacred site (Figure 6.37). Yet the Dome sits on a site sa-
cred to the Jews, the Temple Mount, the site where the Great 
Temple and Second Temple were built and later destroyed. 
Indeed, the Dome is believed to enclose the sacred rock upon 
which Abraham prepared to sacrifice his son, according to 
Jewish tradition, and according to Islamic tradition, is the 
same rock from which the Prophet Muhammad launched his 
spirit on a heavenly visit. Also located at the Temple Mount 
is the Al-Aqsa Mosque, a central sacred site to Muslims.

shows the points of origin of European group-organized pilgrims 
to Lourdes in 1978. These represent only about 30 percent of 
all pilgrims to Lourdes, most of whom travel to the shrine on their 
own. Improved transportation (mainly by train) and the availability 
of organized package trips have contributed to a marked increase 
in the number of pilgrims visiting. Many of the 5 million pilgrims 
who visit the town each year do so in the hope of a miraculous 
cure for medical ills at a grotto where the Virgin Mary is said to 
have appeared before 14-year-old Bernadette Soubirous in a se-
ries of 18 visions in 1858.

As this chapter has shown, language and religion are dynamic 
components of culture and the ways that communication is 
changing is having profound effects on both. It seems reasonable 
to assume, then, that the future of language, communication, 
and belief will be one of accelerating change as new words and 
ways of speaking, reading, and writing will get created through 
the complex interactions of people using a wide range of social 
and other media. Religion likewise will be steadily altered and 
adapted to new conditions as it has been since it emerged among 
settled populations hundreds of thousands of years ago.
What appears to be occurring at the beginning of the 
twenty-first century is that religion will remain an influential 
force globally, although secularization, especially in the core 
countries, will continue. New forms of belief and worship will 
continue to emerge in the twenty-first century at the same time 
that established religions will grow and change as its adherents 
migrate, become modernized, and the religious establishment 
responds to these transformations. For instance, Buddhism is 
an increasingly popular religion affecting Western ideas of sci-
ence and psychology. In contrast, Protestantism appears to be in 
decline and its leaders must consider how best to address this 
change if it is to remain a key part of twenty-first-century life.
Like religion, language is also changing. Whereas many 
languages, very small in terms of the number of speakers, are in 
decline, others are experiencing fortification as more and more 
speakers are being added. English is a language that is experienc-
ing dramatic growth so much so that experts expect its dominance 
will only grow. Migration, globalization, popular culture, and the 
World Wide Web, in combination, support English as the key to 
the world's business, politics, and society. With so many speak-
ers, however, English itself is bound to continue to change as it 
has for centuries. At the same time that English is likely to remain 
an ascendant language for years to come, languages already expe-
riencing decline will most likely continue to do so, 
especially as the native speakers of those languages 
migrate or die. This has been the case, for example, 
with a number of Native American languages such 
as Apalachee, Atakapa, and Eyak that were ulti-
mately replaced by English and are now considered 
extinct with the last native speaker now deceased.
APPLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE
1. Why is English growing in dominance around the world? What do 
you think the effects of extinct languages are? What do we gain by 
having less languages around the world? What do we lose? Think 
about not only the actual languages but concepts and ideas that 
are preserved in languages that do not necessarily translate into 
English. Do you think languages should be preserved?
2. What changes in religion have you noticed in your own life? Com-
pare your beliefs to your parents, your grandparents, and great-
grandparents. What do you observe over time and space in terms 
of social changes, world events, and the rate of communication 
across the world to share ideas? How do you think religion will 
continue to change for your own children?
CONCLUSION
Language and religion are two key elements of cultural sys-
tems: markers of individual and collective identity. As such, 
they are important dimensions of human geographies. They 
are, in many contexts, closely interdependent. The diffusion 
of religion has carried linguistic traits into new areas, while 
the diffusion of language has facilitated the spread of certain 
religious beliefs and practices. Language and religion are also 
implicated in other aspects of human geographies: Many ter-
ritorial conflicts, in particular, involve linguistic and religious 
dimensions.
Language both reflects and influences the way different 
groups understand and interpret their environment, while dif-
ferent groups use language to give or change a place's meaning. 
The names given to places often reflect the physical environ-
ment, local histories, or economic functions, but sometimes in 
ways that are unsuited to contemporary sensibilities, so that 
place names change, just as language itself changes.
The distribution of languages and belief systems can tell 
us much about the changing history of human geography and 
the impact of the movement of people, ideas, capital, and 
technology globally. Language and religion both developed 
in specific hearth regions and diffused around the world in 
various ways. Languages have "drifted" in syntax and mean-
ing through time and space, while belief systems have splin-
tered and mutated.
Today there is great variation within countries and 
even within individual cities and regions in terms of dia-
lect and, sometimes, the preferred language. Similarly, there 
are significant variations in both religious adherence and 
religiosity.
Social media and new forms of communication are rapidly 
altering some aspects of language and facilitating the spread 
of certain aspects of language around the globe. At the same 
time, globalization prompts people to seek to reaffirm the

CHAPTER 6   Language, Communication, and Belief    251
LEARNING OUTCOMES REVISITED
■ Describe how language both reflects and influences the way 
different groups understand and interpret the world.
Language is a means of communication and all languages 
have structures that include rules of grammar, specialized 
vocabularies, and systems of pronunciation. Around the 
world, there are both very large and very small languages 
that link speakers, with New York City being the most lin-
guistically diverse city in the world. Language is also a 
result of social, economic, and political phenomenon like 
imperialism, migration, or slavery where people groups 
are moved from one region of the world to another and de-
velop new ways of communicating, based on these experi-
ences and the dynamic nature of their lives.
■ Compare and contrast different forms of communication be it 
standard language, slang, dialects, social media, and nonverbal 
modes of expression.
Languages are organized into different families, which 
are rooted in their prehistoric origins and then are further 
categorized into branches and groups. States have been in-
fluential in formalizing language and promoting that use 
in courts, legislature, administration, and business. How-
ever, people adapt language and speech patterns every 
day through various modes of expression including cre-
ating new words and expressions of slang, responding to 
technology through social media, and developing regional 
variations called dialects. Human communication is also 
greatly dependent on nonverbal modes like dance, visual 
cues, sound, gestures, and sign language.
■ Interpret how different geographies impact the spread or 
preservation of language and how different groups use lan-
guage to give or change a place's meaning.
Through global communication and business, the domi-
nance of English is growing, while other languages, like 
those of Indigenous peoples in the Western Hemisphere, 
are becoming extinct from nonuse. Geography can affect 
language loss and preservation through the lack of migra-
tion in certain areas. Isolated spaces like Iceland can pre-
serve older forms of their language because the rugged 
landscape and cold climate have discouraged migration 
from other people who bring new concepts/pronunciations 
to the language. The relationship between language and 
space can also be seen in how various communities signify 
places with toponyms. Place names reflect the values of 
a community, the collective use of that space, or honor a 
significant figure. Additionally, toponyms can reveal the 
racial, class, and gender disparities in society, and change 
as people resist the use of stereotypes in the landscape.
■ Describe the global distribution of the world's religions—how 
they developed in specific regions and how they proliferated 
around the world.
The four major world religions—Hinduism, Buddhism, 
Christianity, and Islam—have emerged from specific 
places on the globe but have spread through diaspora. Hin-
duism began in India, which has always been an impor-
tant cultural crossroads. This unique geography allowed 
ideas to mix and migrate from the site of origin, and Bud-
dhism later developed as an offshoot of Hinduism in Ne-
pal. Christianity and Islam were both born in the Middle 
East, another region with waves of human migration and 
cultural sharing. Once states assumed these beliefs as the 
official religions, their impact on law, culture, language, 
and social relationships intensified.
■ Recognize the difference between religions and religious 
movements around the world and analyze their impacts on 
political and social life.
Compare these movements to the global movement of 
"Americanization" and regional cultural nationalism. 
Religions are belief systems and sets of practices that in-
corporate the idea of a power higher than humans. When 
these beliefs are formalized through a system of rituals, 
they are organized religions. Religious movements occur 
when people interpret the teachings of a religion and har-
ness those beliefs in a social and political movement. For 
many people around the world, there is a response to the 
homogenizing effects of "Americanization" on culture and 
a desire to protect communities from "outside influences." 
Islamism is one such political movement and does not in-
clude all Muslims. Militant Islamists resist core, Western 
forces like secularization and modernization, and seek to 
create a fundamentalist society.
■ Interpret the importance of space to religion in pilgrimages 
and sacred spaces in every culture.
Sacred spaces are physical settings recognized by a com-
munity of people as significant to religious and/or spiri-
tual events. They are assigned this value by a group of 
people and can be as diverse as the Dome of the Rock in Je-
rusalem for Muslims or the Black Hills in South Dakota for 
the Lakota people—one is a temple on a sacred rock and 
other is the natural environment of the hills without any 
human-made structure. Geographer Yi-Fu Tuan defines 
sacred spaces as those that rise above the commonplace 
and interrupt ordinary routine. Pilgrimages are journeys to 
these sacred spaces.
distinctiveness of places and cultures. One outcome of this 
has been the revival of minority languages; another has been 
the growth of religious nationalism. More generally, modern 
communications systems and social media have contributed 
both to the propagation of religious fundamentalism and to 
changes and challenges to religious beliefs and precepts.

REVIEW & DISCUSSION
1. Conduct an Internet search on a small or endangered lan-
guage not discussed in the text. Where is it spoken and 
by how many speakers? In what language family/branch/
group is this language a member? Why is it endangered? 
Compare the phenomenon of language loss and preserva-
tion outlined in this chapter to the processes in the lan-
guage you research. Do you notice any similarities? Are 
there any efforts to revitalize or preserve the language?
2. As discussed, nonverbal communication is a critical 
component of how human beings interact. But how does 
nonverbal communication allow us to communicate with 
non-humans? Consider the relationships people have with 
their pets or working animals by looking up articles on 
how animals communicate with people. Think about your 
own nonverbal communication with animals. (Hint: Look 
at the subject of "anthropomorphizing." Do animals pick 
up on our social cues and mimic them, or is it a reciprocal 
relationship? In other words, how much do we adopt ani-
mal cues? How do you think nonverbal human-to-animal 
communication impacts social space? Consider stories of 
how horses and elephants heal from trauma or how dogs 
hold memories of loved ones, etc.)
3. Research the religious organizations in your area. Do you 
live near any of these spaces? Are certain religions more 
widely represented than others? List all of the religious 
centers in your area and examine their role in the com-
munity. For example, do followers offer social services or 
host special events in your neighborhood? Do any of these 
organizations work with each other; that is, do they hold 
interfaith dialogues directed toward issues of conflict reso-
lution between the communities or shared contemporary 
issues like environmental concerns? Are some of these 
spaces involved in politics—either directly by supporting 
candidates, or indirectly, by influencing public opinion 
and the decision and policy making processes of the gov-
ernment? Are some centers wealthier than others? Why do 
you think this is?
 4. Consider the notion of religion and its links to landscape. 
Does religion express itself on space only in the form of sa-
cred spaces and sites of pilgrimage? Within the context of 
your country, examine the multiple ways in which religion 
may have been shaping space (for example, the segregation 
of residential localities based on religion, public protests 
and the relocation of slaughter houses, incidences and 
location of communal tensions, violence and riots, etc.). 
Make a list of ten such instances and critically discuss 
these cases to examine the role of religion in shaping and 
creating geographical spaces.
UNPLUGGED
1. Draft a language tree based on your background. Using 
a language family map as your guide, construct a tree 
or visual graph of the languages you speak back to your 
ancestors. Think about where they come from, what lan-
guages they were born into, the languages they adopted, 
and the languages of their spouses. How far back do you 
go to non-English as the language spoken at home? None 
or one generation? Twelve or more generations? What 
does this tell you about language acquisition and human 
migration?
 2. Search the Internet to explore cases where languages have 
been the main source of political movements. These social 
and political movements may range from official recogni-
tion of these languages to demands for separate statehood. 
What roles does language play in these social and political 
movements? Do you think that language movements indi-
cate the preservation and revival of languages? What does 
the revival and preservation of languages signify in the era 
of globalization, with faster information and communica-
tion technologies?

CHAPTER 6   Language, Communication, and Belief    253
DATA ANALYSIS
3. Consider Yi-Fu Tuan's theory on sacred spaces and write 
an essay on a space sacred to you. How does he define 
sacred spaces and how is that different (or the same) as a 
place of worship? What is your sacred place and why is it 
special? Does it hold an important memory? Do you go to 
this place to mediate or to celebrate? Is this place secret or 
shared with others (like a family vacation space)?
In this chapter we have looked at both language and religion 
and the effect geography has on both particularly through the 
movement of people and spiritual beliefs and the relationships 
between people and places, especially sacred one. Let's now 
look at how both concepts can be manipulated in geopolitical 
spaces.
First, analyze how "Islam" became synonymous 
with "terrorism." Think about how both "Is-
lamist" militant groups falsely represent the reli-
gion and how anti-Islamic politicians stereotype 
all Muslims. Read Professor Juan Cole's "Top Ten 
Ways Islamic Law Forbids Terrorism."
 1. List at least five ways Islam prohibits terrorism.
 2. Why do you think many militant groups like Boko Haram 
and Al-Qaeda present themselves as pious Muslims?
 3. How do misrepresentations affect perceptions of Islam to 
outsiders of that religion?
 4. Discuss another example of a religion that has been mis-
represented and how different followers attempt to educate 
outsiders.
Second, read how the New York Times (NYT) 
debated using the word torture in their reports, 
partially through the influence of the U.S. Justice 
Department under both Presidents Bush and 
Obama. Go to "The Executive Editor on the Word 
'Torture.' "
 5. What is "torture"?
 6. Why is it hard to define, or do you think it is hard to 
define?
 7. Do you think the NYT censored its own journalists by not 
using the word torture when writing about C.I.A. methods? 
Why or why not?
 8. How does politics intersect with communication to push 
certain agendas? Do you think there is a way to report po-
litical news without using manipulative language?
Using what you learned from both of these stories, answer 
these last two questions:
 9. Language can be used to bring the world together, but also 
to separate people based on beliefs and perceptions of 
those beliefs. Do you use the terms torture and terror when 
talking about politics today? Define what you mean when 
you use them and challenge yourself to be specific. Think 
about the difference between religion and politics, and 
how they intersect.
 10. Complex spiritual, political, and social issues around 
the world are often represented as stereotypes or sound 
bytes. Discuss one recent news story where you think 
language was used to manipulate public opinion. Share 
how you resisted making assumptions and drew your own 
conclusions.

INTERPRETING 
PLACES AND 
LANDSCAPES
7
The average tourist usually seeks out landscapes that are beautiful 
or famous. Think: Yosemite National Park, the Eiffel Tower, the Taj Mahal, 
or the Serengeti Plains. These sites are thought to evoke grandeur, natural 
beauty, and awe. In addition to being attracted to splendid or famous land-
scapes, tourists have also been keen to visit the more prosaic landscapes of 
everyday life, such as the floating villages of Cambodia, the night markets 
of Chang Mai, Thailand, and the horse farms of Kentucky blue grass coun-
try. Tourists spend billions of dollars each year to visit these landscapes both 
grand and ordinary.
A new trend in tourism, however, is one that is becoming most commonly 
known as anti-tourism. Anti-tourism deliberately seeks to avoid the sublime 
and even the commonplace in order to know more about the underbelly of our 
world; i.e. the dirty, dangerous, the prohibited, and even the toxic landscapes 
that have been made by human hands but hidden away, abandoned, or just not 
attractive or interesting to the mainstream traveller for one reason or another.
Anti-tourists are interested in getting away from the fully inclusive tour that 
installs the visitor in relaxing, luxurious surroundings. They prefer to explore 
the unsavory stuff that the tourism bureaus don't want visitors to know about. 
For example, a tour that has been offered for four years, "The Poison Caul-
dron," enables tourists to visit one of New York City's most toxic landscapes: 
Newton Creek. Located along the banks of Newton Creek are the waste trans-
fer and petroleum districts of North Brooklyn, a borough of New York City. 
With the help of a local historian, tourists are guided along a three-mile trek 
through Greenpoint, the northernmost neighborhood in Brooklyn that faces 
the financial district of Manhattan across the East River.
Greenpoint was farmland during the early colonial period. In the nineteenth 
century it became industrialized with rope factories, lumberyards, shipbuild-
ing, glasswork, and foundry activities. In the twentieth century, when the in-
dustrial activities had mostly ceased, Greenpoint became the site for a huge 

256 
HUMAN GEOGRAPHY   Places and Regions in Global Context
incinerator facility, a sewage treatment plant, an elec-
troplating company, and a transfer point for municipal 
waste collected from New York City. In 1950, Newton 
Creek, a small tributary of the East River, experienced 
what was then the worst oil spill in U.S. history, which 
has yet to be completely ameliorated.
In short, Newton Creek is hardly the sort of landscape 
that would attract the average tourist. And yet, walk-
ing tours (closed-toed shoes highly recommended) of 
The Poison Cauldron run every Saturday afternoon 
commencing at DUKBO, an area Down Under the Kos-
ciuszko Bridge Onramp. Why visit a toxic site where 
you learn about how the bottom of Newton Creek is 
coved by a 15-20 foot layer of "black mayonnaise," that 
smells like petroleum and contains 150 years of indus-
trial waste, human excrement, petroleum residue, and 
coal tar? The answer is that the mostly young people 
who take the tour are seeking a form of fun that devi-
ates from the usual, the tame, and the predictable. They 
want an experience that isn't "prettified" and that few 
others would be interested in having.
Other forms of anti-tourism that are directed at expe-
riencing unconventional landscapes include "urban 
exploration" and "dark tourism." Urban exploration, 
also called urbex or UE, focuses on the investigation 
of infrastructure, including abandoned ruins such 
as unused grain elevators, factories, fallout shelters, 
or schools—or built landscapes like sewers, storage 
sites, and utility tunnels that are normally off-limits 
or have restricted access. Urban explorers thrive on 
the physical danger and possibility of arrest and pun-
ishment that often accompany the "infiltration" of 
these sites.
In contrast, dark tourism involves travel to sites that 
are associated with death or tragedy such as castles, 
battlefields, slave quarters and dungeons, as 
well as sites of disasters including Ground Zero 
in New York, after the 9/11 disaster or the Aus-
chwitz concentration camp in Poland. Both dark 
tourism and urban exploration are forms of anti-
tourism that push the boundaries of human re-
lationships to landscapes as they reject the kind 
of experience that celebrates and reinforces the 
desirability of made-for-tourists sites and em-
brace experiences that peel back the complexity 
and contradictory aspects that constitute all such 
places.
In this chapter, we examine those complex re-
lationships to place and landscape, attempting 
to unravel the complexity and understand the 
way it's generated and understood and the ef-
fects it has on people. We will also look at how 
places and landscapes are interpreted differently by 
different groups of people and why those differences 
matter.
BEHAVIOR, KNOWLEDGE,  
AND HUMAN ENVIRONMENTS
In addition to attempting to understand how the environ-
ment shapes and is shaped by people, geographers also seek 
to identify how it is perceived and understood by people. 
Asserting that there is interdependence between people and 
places, geographers explore how individuals and groups ac-
quire knowledge of their environments and how this knowl-
edge shapes their attitudes and behaviors. Some geographers 
focus their research on natural hazards as a way of address-
ing environmental knowledge, while others try to understand 
how people ascribe meaning to landscape and places. In this 
chapter, we consider the key geographical concepts of place, 
landscape, and space and explore the ways in which people 
understand them, create them, and operate within them. Our 
goal is to understand how individuals and groups experience 
their environments, create and struggle within places, and 
find meaning in the landscapes they create.
In their attempts to understand environmental perception 
and knowledge, geographers share a great deal with other so-
cial scientists, but especially with psychologists. Human cogni-
tion and behavior are at the center of psychology. What makes 
environmental knowledge and behavior uniquely geographical 
is their relation to both the environmental context and the hu-
mans who struggle to understand and operate within it. Much 
of what we as humans know about the environment we live in 
is learned through direct and indirect experience. Our environ-
mental knowledge is also acquired through a filter of personal 
and group characteristics, such as race, gender, stage of the life 
cycle, religious beliefs, and where we live (Figure 7.1).

CHAPTER 7   Interpreting Places and Landscapes   257
For instance, children have interesting and distinct rela-
tionships to the physical and cultural environment. How do 
children acquire knowledge about their environments? How do 
boys and girls differ in the ways they learn about and negotiate 
their environments? What kind of environmental knowledge 
do children acquire, and how do they use it? What role do cul-
tural influences play in the process? What happens when larger 
social, economic, and environmental changes take place?
Geographer Cindi Katz conducted research in rural Sudan 
to find answers to these questions. Working with a group of 
10-year-old children in a small village, she sought to discover 
how they acquired environmental knowledge. What she also 
learned was how the transformation of agriculture in the region 
changed not only the children's relationships to their families 
and community but also their perceptions of nature.1 In this 
Sudanese village, as in similar communities elsewhere in the 
periphery, children were important contributors to subsis-
tence activities, especially planting, weeding, and harvesting. 
The villagers were strict Muslims and thus had stringent rules 
about what female members of the community were allowed to 
do and where they were allowed to go. Many of the subsistence 
activities that required leaving the family compound were cus-
tomarily delegated to male children. Within the traditional 
subsistence culture, boys predominated in all agricultural tasks 
except planting and harvesting and were responsible for herd-
ing livestock as well. Many boys (and occasionally girls) were 
also responsible for fetching water and helping to gather fire-
wood. Both boys and girls collected seasonal foods from lands 
surrounding the village. Work and play were often mixed to-
gether, and play, as well as work, provided a creative means for 
acquiring and using environmental knowledge and for devel-
oping a finely textured sense of the home area (Figure 7.2).
What happens when the agricultural production system 
is thoroughly changed, as it was in this village when irrigated 
cash-crop cultivation was introduced? Through an interna-
tional development scheme, with the financial assistance of 
outside donors, a Sudanese government project transformed 
the agriculture of the region from subsistence livestock rais-
ing and cultivation of sorghum and sesame to cultivation of ir-
rigated cash crops such as cotton. The new cash-crop regime, 
which required management of irrigation works, application of

environmental knowledge Sudanese children possess of the landscape that surrounds their village. The village is an Islamic one, and norms determine the kinds 
of tasks in which boys and girls can participate. Only boys are allowed to tend sheep, which requires a particular environmental knowledge about grazing areas 
and water availability.

fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides, and more frequent weed-
ing, required children as well as adults to work longer and 
harder. Parents were often forced to keep their children out of 
school because many of the tasks had to be done during the 
school term.
Destruction of local forests required children to range far-
ther afield to procure fuelwood and to make gathering trips 
more frequently. Soon wealthier households began buying 
wood rather than increasing the demands on their children or 
other household members. For the children of more margin-
alized households, the selling of fuelwood, foods, and other 
items provided a new means for earning cash to support their 
families but also placed increasing demands on their energies 
and resourcefulness and changed their whole experience of 
their world.
For the children of this village, globalization (in the form 
of the transition to cash-crop agriculture) altered their rela-
tionships with their environments and with their futures. The 
kinds of skills the children had learned for subsistence produc-
tion were no longer useful for cash-crop production. As they 
played less and worked longer hours in more specialized roles, 
their experience of their environment narrowed. At the same 
time, as their roles within the family changed, they attended 
school less and learned less about their world through formal 
education. As a result, their perceptions of their environment 
transformed, along with their values and attitudes toward the 
landscape and the place they knew as home.
APPLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE
1. Describe the difference in the lifestyle, work, play, and education 
regime for young people in the rural Sudan example, when the 
community moved into cash crop cultivation.
2. Scrutinize how globalization has shaped the environment you 
operate in as a student. How has it shaped you—the buildings, 
the people, the climate, the social life, et cetera—and how do you 
shape it by interacting with it?
PLACE-MAKING
Places are socially constructed—given different meanings 
by different groups for different purposes. Most people iden-
tify with places as part of their personal identity, drawing on 
particular images and particular histories of places in order to 
lend distinctiveness to both their individuality and their sense 
of community. But identifying with place may also imply the 
exclusion of other people and the stereotyping of other places. 
People often reinforce their sense of place and of who they are 
by contrasting themselves with places and people they feel are 
very different from them. Seen in this context, place-making 
stands at the center of issues of culture and power relations, 
a key part of the systems of meaning through which we make 
sense of the world.
There is another important dimension to the relation-
ship between places and their inhabitants, and it has a lot to 
do with identity. We each "manage" several distinct roles or 
identities at once. This is particularly characteristic in urban 
environments because of the physical and functional separa-
tion of the "audiences" to which different roles are addressed: 
family, neighbours, co-workers, club members, and so on. Peo-
ple are consequently able to present very different "selves" in 
different socio-spatial contexts. The city, with its wide range 
of different roles and identities, becomes a "magic theatre, " or 
an "emporium of styles, "—the anonymity afforded by the ease 
of slipping from one role to another often facilitates the emer-
gence of unconventional behavior.
Territoriality
Some social scientists believe that wanting to have a place 
where you feel you belong is a natural human attribute, part 
of a strong territorial instinct. Humans, it is argued, have an 
innate sense of territoriality, just like many other species. The 
concept of territoriality refers to the persistent attachment of 
individuals or peoples to a specific location or territory. The 
concept is important to geographers because it can be related to 
fundamental place-making forces.
The specific study of people's sense of territoriality is part 
of the field of ethology, the scientific study of the formation 
and evolution of human customs and beliefs. The term also 
refers to the study of the behavior of animals in their natural 
environments. According to ethologists, humans carry genetic 
traits resulting from our species' need for territory. Territory 
provides a source of physical safety and security, a source of 
stimulation (through border disputes), and a physical expres-
sion of identity. These needs add up to a strong territorial urge 
that can be seen in people's behavior: claims to space in read-
ing rooms or on beaches, for example, and claims made by 
gangs to neighborhood turf (Figure 7.3). Ethologists argue that 
the territorial urge also can be observed when people become 
frustrated because of overcrowding. They become stressed and, 
in some circumstances, begin to exhibit aggressive or deviant 
behavior. Ethologists and environmental psychologists link 
crowding to everything from vandalism and assault to promis-
cuity, listlessness, and clinical depression.

hood gangs to establish and proclaim their identity.

CHAPTER 7   Interpreting Places and Landscapes   259
Proxemics While such claims are difficult to substantiate, as 
is the whole notion that humans have an inborn sense of ter-
ritoriality, the idea of territoriality as a product of culturally 
established meanings is supported by a large body of scien-
tific evidence. Some of this evidence comes from the field of 
proxemics, the study of the social and cultural meanings that 
people give to personal space. These meanings make for un-
written territorial rules that can be seen in the microgeography 
of people's behavior. It has been established, for example, that 
people develop unwritten protocols about how to claim space. 
One common protocol is simply regular use (think of students' 
habits in classroom seating arrangements). Another is through 
the use of spatial markers such as a newspaper or a towel to fix 
a space in a reading room or on a beach. There are also bubbles, 
or areas, of personal space that we try not to invade (or allow 
to be invaded by others). Varying in size and shape according 
to location and circumstance, these bubbles tend to be smaller 
in public places and in busier and more crowded situations; to 
be larger among strangers and in situations involving members 
of different social classes; and to vary from one social class or 
cultural group to another.
Social and cultural needs On larger spatial scales, terri-
toriality is mostly a product of political relations and cultural 
systems. This aspect of territoriality underpins a great deal of 
human geography. All social organizations and the individuals 
who belong to them are bound at some scale or another through 
formal or informal territorial limits. Many organizations— 
nations, corporations, unions, clubs—actually claim a specific 
area of geographic space to be under their influence or con-
trol. In this context, territoriality can be defined as any attempt 
to assert control over other people, resources, or relationships 
over a specific geographic area. Territoriality also is defined 
as any attempt to fulfill socially produced needs for identity, 
defense, and stimulation. Territoriality covers many phenom-
ena, including the property rights of individuals and private 
corporations; the neighborhood covenants of homeowners' 
associations; the market areas of commercial businesses; the 
heartlands of ethnic or cultural groups; the jurisdictions of 
 local, state, and national governments; and the reach of trans-
national corporations and supranational organizations.
Territoriality thus provides a means of meeting three social 
and cultural needs:
■ The regulation of social interaction
■ The regulation of access to people and resources
■ The provision of a focus and symbol of group membership 
and identity
Territoriality also gives tangible form to power and control 
but does so in a way that directs attention away from the per-
sonal relationships between the controlled and the controllers. 
In other words, rules and laws become associated with particu-
lar spaces and territories rather than with particular individu-
als or groups. Finally, territoriality allows people to create and 
maintain a framework through which to experience the world 
and give it meaning. Bounded territories, for example, make it 
easier to differentiate "us" from "them."
Street Art
Street art has become widespread as an element of place mak-
ing. In some localities, it can be a major component of com-
munity identity. In San Francisco's Latino Mission district, for 
example, the streets are lined with the highest concentration of 
mural art in the world—more than 500 public art pieces within 
a 30-block radius (Figure 7.4a). The powerful association be-
tween street art and place has been noticed by business. The 
visual identity system for Coca-Cola's 2014 World Cup adver-
tising campaign, for example, used the work of São Paulo street 
artist Speto (Figure 7.4b), while Pepsi-Cola's Art of Football 
campaign also had a street-art flavor.
Street art has also become an instrument of social com-
mentary and satire. The most famous exponent is the British 
artist Banksy, who began "bombing" walls in Bristol, Eng-
land, during the 1990s with his stenciled art (Figure 7.4c) and 
has since bombed cities as far apart as Vienna, San Francisco, 
Barcelona, Paris, and Detroit. A similar approach has been 
followed by the Iranian street artist Black Hand—dubbed the 
"Iranian Banksy" by some media outlets—whose daring work 
on the walls and buildings of Tehran have gone viral on Face-
book and Twitter. In 2014 he painted an image of a young 
woman wearing Iran's soccer national team's jersey and rais-
ing a bottle of dish-washing soap (called Jaam, which means 
championship cup in Farsi). The image (Figure 7.4d) refers to 
the political culture that encourages women to stay at home, 
as in the ban against women attending sporting events.

People and Places, Insiders  
and Outsiders
Places are constantly under social construction as people re-
spond to the opportunities and constraints of their particular 
locality. As the famous American critic and historian Lewis 
Mumford put it, "in the state of building at any period one 
may discover, in legible script, the complicated process and 
changes that are taking place within civilization itself. "2 But 
places are never simply straightforward mirrors or neutral 
containers of social processes. They are created by specific 
sets of people, and they draw their distinctive character from 
the people that inhabit them. As social groups occupy places, 
they gradually impose themselves on their environment,

modifying and adjusting it, as best they can, to suit their 
needs and express their values. Yet at the same time people 
themselves gradually accommodate both to their physical 
environment and to the people around them. There is thus 
a continuous two-way process, what geographer Edward 
Soja called a sociospatial dialectic, in which people create 
and modify places while at the same time being conditioned 
in various ways by the spaces in which they live and work. 
People are constantly modifying and reshaping places, and 
places are constantly coping with change and influencing 
their inhabitants.
Places are both centers of meaning for people and the 
frameworks for their actions and behavior. It is important to 
remember that places are constructed by their inhabitants from 
their own subjective point of view and that they are simultane-
ously constructed and seen as an external "other" by outsid-
ers. A neighborhood, for example, is both an area of special 
meanings to its residents as well as an area containing houses, 
streets, and people that others may view from an outsider's 
("decentered") perspective.
As we saw in Chapter 1, a key concept is that of the life-
world, the taken-for-granted pattern and context through 
which people conduct their day-to-day lives without having to 
make it an object of conscious attention. People's familiarity 
with one another's vocabulary, speech patterns, dress codes, 
gestures, and humor, and with shared experiences of their 
 
 

CHAPTER 7   Interpreting Places and Landscapes   261
In Chandigarh, India, a one-of-a-kind sculpture installation called the Rock 
Garden was created by Nek Chand Saini. Nek Chand was a road inspector 
in the 1950s, while the city was being redeveloped as the first "planned city 
in India" under the influence of Swiss architect Le Corbusier. Nek Chand col-
lected debris from the construction sites and began building his "magic king-
dom" on government owned land. This angered city officials who wanted 
to destroy Nek Chand's garden for violating laws established under Le Cor-
busier's "beautiful city" plan. Public opinion, however, sided with Nek Chand 
and he was able to quit his job and devote his life to creating the Rock Gar-
den (http://nekchand.com/background). Today, Nek Chand's Rock Garden 
hosts over 5,000 visitors a day and people continue to build his vision. You 
can take a virtual tour of the garden with these panoramic photos (http://
nekchand.com/gallery/interactive-panoramas) and this video (http://vimeo.
com/67800249).
Nek Chand's Rock Garden is an example of what many call visionary or 
"outsider art." Unlike fine art, which is taught in schools, galleries and museums, 
"outsider art" is produced by people from the fringes of society. Nek Chand 
was from a lower caste and had no formal art education, his methods were 
self-taught and he used debris as his material—long before recycling was a 
hip thing to do. Nek Chand created a space that undermined the "beautiful

city" plan and created an "outsider" landscape deep within an urban area. A 
place that many outsiders from around the world continue to seek.
"Outsider art" is a term coined in 1922 by Dr. Hans Prinzhorn for art 
produced by psychiatric patients, but grew to encompass all art out-
side the fine art world. Dr. Prinzhorn articulated a boundary between 
the  "inside" art in a society, and art outside the mainstream. Insider art 
or fine art is work which reinforces social ideas about beauty and form, 
philosophies of life and death, the techniques we prize, and/or the artists 
we choose to venerate as "masters." With outsider art, artists are laborers, 
farmers, housewives, retirees, disabled, poor, and often are members of 
ethnicities and groups underrepresented in fine art institutions. Because 
they lack formal training, they develop original techniques and use non- 
conventional materials—anything from toothpicks to tattoos to motorcy-
cle parts. Outsider art is highly individualized and intuitive, but a common 
theme for many is creating utopias like the Rock Garden.  Drawing from 
their experiences outside the mainstream, these artists seek to create 
alternative landscapes.

outside of? What are other cultural expressions that are "outside" the 
mainstream forms? What does

social categories?

physical environment, often carries over into people's attitudes 
and feelings about themselves and their locality and to the 
symbolism they attach to that place. When this happens, the 
result is a collective and self-conscious "structure of feeling": 
a sociocultural frame of reference generated among people be-
cause of the experiences and memories that they associate with 
a particular place.
Experience and Meaning
The interactions between people and places raise some fun-
damental questions about the meanings that people attach to 
their experiences: How do people process information from ex-
ternal settings? What kind of information do they use? How do 
new experiences affect the way they understand their worlds? 

262 
HUMAN GEOGRAPHY   Places and Regions in Global Context
What meanings do particular environments have for individu-
als? How do these meanings influence behavior? How do peo-
ple develop and modify their sense of a place, and what does it 
mean to them? The answers to these questions are by no means 
complete. It is clear, however, that people filter information 
from their environments through neurophysiological processes 
and draw on personality and culture to produce cognitive im-
ages of their environment, representations of the world that 
can be called to mind through the imagination (Figure 7.5). 
Cognitive images are what people see in the mind's eye when 
they think of a particular place or setting.
Cognitive images both simplify and distort real-world 
environments. Research has suggested, for example, that 
many people tend to organize their cognitive images of par-
ticular parts of their world in terms of several simple ele-
ments (Figure 7.6):
Paths: The channels along which they and others move; 
for example, streets, walkways, transit lines, canals.
Edges: Barriers that separate one area from another; for 
 example, shorelines, walls, railroad tracks.
▲ Figure 7.5 The formation of cognitive images People form cognitive images as a product of information about the real world, experienced directly and 
indirectly, and filtered through their senses, brain, personality, and the attitudes and values they have acquired from their cultural background.

▲ Figure 7.6 Cognitive image of Boston This map was compiled by Kevin Lynch from interviews with a sample of Boston residents. Lynch found that the resi-
dents of Boston tended to structure their cognitive images of the city with the same elements. He produced ingenious maps, such as this one, to demonstrate the 
collective "mental map" of the city, using symbols of different boldness or color to indicate the proportion of respondents who had mentioned each element.

CHAPTER 7   Interpreting Places and Landscapes   263
Districts: Areas with an identifiable character (physical 
and/or cultural) that people mentally "enter" and "leave"; 
for example, a business district or an ethnic neighborhood.
Nodes: Strategic points and foci for travel; for example, 
street corners, traffic junctions, city squares.
Landmarks: Physical reference points; for example, dis-
tinctive landforms, buildings, or monuments.
Individual landscape features may function as more than 
one kind of cognitive element. A freeway, for instance, may be 
perceived as both an edge and a path in a person's cognitive 
image of a city. Similarly, a railroad terminal may be seen as 
both a landmark and a node.
Distortions in our cognitive images are partly the result of 
incomplete information. Once we get beyond our immediate 
living area, we know few spaces in complete detail. Yet our 
worlds—especially those of us in developed countries that 
are directly tied to global networks of communication and 
 knowledge—are increasingly large in geographic scope. As a 
result, these worlds must be conceived, or understood, with 
limited direct stimuli. We have to rely on fragmentary and often 
biased information from other people, from books, magazines, 
television, and the Internet. Distortions in cognitive images are 
also partly the result of our own biases. What we remember 
about places, what we like or dislike, what we think is signifi-
cant are all functions of our personalities, our experiences, and 
the cultural influences to which we have been exposed.

1. What is the "sociospatial dialectic", referred to by geographer  
Edward Soja? Give an example of both people reshaping space, 
and places influencing their inhabitants.
2. Use the five elements noted in this section of the chapter to map 
out your image of your neighborhood. What are the key paths, 
edges, districts, nodes, and landmarks that form your cognitive 
image?
Images and Behavior
Cognitive images are compiled, in part, through behavioral pat-
terns. Environments are "learned" through experience. Mean-
while, cognitive images, once generated, influence behavior. 
Via this two-way relationship, cognitive images are constantly 
changing. Each of us also generates—and draws on—different 
kinds of cognitive images in different circumstances.
Elements such as districts, nodes, and landmarks are im-
portant in the kinds of cognitive images that people use to ori-
ent themselves and to navigate within a place or region. The 
more of these elements an environment contains—and the 
more distinctive they are—the more legible that environment 
is to people and the easier it is to get oriented and navigate. 
In addition, the more firsthand information people have about 
their environment, and the more they are able to draw on sec-
ondary sources of information, the more detailed and compre-
hensive their images are.
This phenomenon is strikingly illustrated in Figure 7.7, 
which shows the collective image of Los Angeles as seen by the 
residents of three different neighborhoods: Westwood, an afflu-
ent neighborhood; Avalon, a poor, inner-city neighborhood; and 
Boyle Heights, a poor, immigrant neighborhood. The residents 
of Westwood have a well-formed, detailed, and comprehensive 
image of the entire Los Angeles basin. At the other end of the 
socioeconomic spectrum, residents of the African- American 
neighborhood of Avalon, near Watts, have a vaguer image of 
the city, structured only by the major east-west boulevards 
and freeways and dominated by the gridiron layout of streets 
between Watts and the city center. The Spanish- speaking res-
idents of Boyle Heights—even less affluent, less mobile, and 
more isolated by language—have an extremely restricted image 
of the city. Their world consists of a small area around Brook-
lyn Avenue and First Street, bounded by the landmarks of city 
hall, the bus depot, and Union Station.
The importance of these images goes beyond people's abil-
ity simply to navigate around their environments. The nar-
rower and more localized people's images are, for example, 
the less they will tend to venture beyond their home area. 
Their behavior becomes circumscribed by their cognitive im-
agery. People's images of places also shape particular aspects 
of their behavior. Research on shopping in cities, for example, 
has shown that customers do not necessarily go to the nearest 
store or to the one with the lowest prices; they are influenced 
by the configuration of traffic, parking, and pedestrian circula-
tion within their imagery of the environment. The significance 
of this clearly has not been lost on the developers of shopping 
malls, who always provide extensive space for free parking and 
multiple entrances and exits.
In addition, shopping behavior, like many other aspects 
of behavior, is influenced by people's values and feelings. A 
district in a city, for example, may be regarded as attractive or 
repellent, exciting or relaxing, fearsome or reassuring, or, more 
likely, a combination of such feelings. As is the case with all 
cognitive imagery, such images are produced through a com-
bination of direct experience and indirect information, all fil-
tered through personal and cultural perspectives. Images such 
as these often exert a strong influence on behavior. Returning 
to the example of consumer behavior, one of the strongest in-
fluences on shopping patterns relates to the imagery evoked by 
retail environments—something else that has not escaped the 
developers of malls, who spend large sums of money to estab-
lish the right atmosphere and image for their projects.
Shopping behavior is one narrow example of the influ-
ence of place imagery on behavior. Additional examples can be 
drawn from every aspect of human geography and at every spa-
tial scale. The settlement of North America, for example, was 
strongly influenced by the changing images of the Plains and the 
West. In the early 1800s, the Plains and the West were perceived 
as arid and unattractive, an image reinforced by early atlases. 
When the railroad companies wanted to encourage settlement 
in these regions, they changed people's image of the Plains and 
the West with advertising campaigns that portrayed them as fer-
tile and hospitable regions. The images associated with differ-
ent regions and localities continue to shape settlement patterns. 
People draw on their cognitive imagery, for example, in making

decisions about migrating from one area to another. Figure 7.8 
shows the composite image of the United States held by a group 
of Virginia Tech students, based on the perceived attractiveness 
of cities and states as places in which to live.
Another example of the influence of cognitive imagery on 
people's behavior is the way that people respond to environ-
mental hazards, such as floods, droughts, earthquakes, storms, 
and landslides, and come to terms with the associated risks and 
uncertainties. Some people attempt to change the unpredict-
able into the knowable by imposing order where none really 
exists (resorting to folk wisdom about weather, for example), 
while others deny all predictability and take a fatalistic view. 
Some tend to overestimate both the degree and the intensity of 
natural hazards, while others tend to underestimate them.
Finally, one aspect of cognitive imagery is of special im-
portance in modifying people's behavior: the sentimental and 
symbolic attributes ascribed to places. Through their daily 
lives and the cumulative effects of cultural influences and sig-

They do this simultaneously at different geographic scales:

called topophilia. Topophilia literally means "love of place." 
Geographers use the term to describe the complex emotions 
and meanings associated with particular places that, for one 
reason or another, have become significant to individuals. 
Most people have a home area, hometown, or home region for 
which they have a special attachment or sense of identity and 
belonging.

LANDSCAPES AS HUMAN SYSTEMS
Landscape is a term that means different things to different 
people. For some, the term brings to mind the design of formal 
gardens and parks, as in landscape architecture. For others, 
landscape signifies a bucolic countryside or even the orga-
nization of residences and public buildings. For still others, 
landscape calls to mind the artistic rendering of scenery, as in 
landscape painting.
Since 1925, when Carl Sauer advocated the study of the 
cultural landscape as a uniquely geographical pursuit, new 
generations of geographers have been expanding the concept. 
The fact that different people comprehend the landscape dif-
ferently is central to the humanistic approach in geography. 
This approach places the individual—especially individual 
values, meaning systems, intentions, and conscious acts—at 
the center of analysis. As the Sudanese example given earlier 
in the chapter suggests, children's perceptions of their worlds 
are different from those of their parents, and girls may see their 
world differently from boys, even in the same family.
Environmental perception and its close relative, behavioral 
geography are interdisciplinary, drawing together geographers, 
landscape architects, psychologists, architects, and others. Pro-
fessionals in these disciplines investigate what preferences 
people have in landscapes, how they construct cognitive im-
ages of their worlds, and how they find (or fail to find) their 
way around in various settings. A focus on the perceptions of 
individuals is an important counterweight to the tendency to 
talk about a social group or society more generally. Neverthe-
less, some critics argue that humanistic research has limited 
utility because individual attitudes and views do not necessar-
ily add up to the views held by a group or a society.
One alternative to the humanistic approach explores both 
the role of larger forces, such as culture, gender, and the state, 
and the ways in which these forces enhance or constrain in-
dividuals' lives. Much recent cultural geographical work, 
therefore, conceptualizes the relationship of people and the 
environment as interactive, not one-way, and emphasizes the 
role that landscapes play in shaping and reinforcing human 
practices. This most recent conceptualization of landscape is 
more dynamic and complex than the one Carl Sauer advanced, 
and it encourages geographers to look outside their own dis-
cipline—to anthropology, psychology, sociology, and even his-
tory—to fully understand its complexity.
The Social Meaning of Landscapes
Geographers study vernacular (ordinary) landscapes because 
they reflect the distinctive attributes of particular places or re-
gions. They also study "landscapes of power," such as clusters 
of corporate tower blocks, and "landscapes of despair," such 
as homeless encampments and derelict landscapes. The lat-
ter are landscapes that have experienced abandonment, mis-
use, disinvestment, or vandalism. Additionally, geographers 
study symbolic landscapes because they reflect certain values

or ideals—either those intended by the builders or financiers 
of particular places or those perceived by other groups. Some 
individual buildings and structures are so powerfully symbolic 
that they come to stand for entire cities: the Eiffel Tower in 
Paris, the Colosseum in Rome, and the Sugarloaf in Rio de Ja-
neiro, for example (Figure 7.9). However, generic landscapes of 
different kinds are most interesting to geographers.
Ordinary Landscapes Some landscapes come to symbol-
ize entire nations or cultures. Quite ordinary landscapes can 
be powerfully symbolic because they are understood as be-
ing a particular kind of place. The stereotypical New England 
townscape, for example (Figure 7.10a), is widely taken to repre-
sent not just a certain type of regional architecture but the best 
that Americans have known "of an intimate, family-centered,

God-fearing, morally conscious, industrious, thrifty, demo-
cratic community."3 A second ordinary townscape with power-
ful symbolic connotations is the typical Main Street of Middle 
America (Figure 7.10b). It is "middle" in several respects: be-
tween the frontier to the west and the cosmopolitan seaports to 
the east, between agricultural regions and industrial metropo-
lises, between affluence and poverty. It has come to symbolize 
places with a balanced community, populated by property-
minded, law-abiding citizens devoted to free enterprise and 
a certain kind of social morality. Another everyday landscape 
that looms large in the national and international popular 
imagination is the American highway. US Route 66, connect-
ing Chicago to Los Angeles along more than 2,400 miles of 
roadway, is the classic example, and its quintessentially Amer-
ican signage and automobile-oriented buildings (See Box 7.2: 
 "Visualizing Geography: Route 66") have become iconic of an 
era of optimism, movement, new opportunities, and indomi-
table spirit. John Steinbeck, in his famous novel The Grapes 
of Wrath, proclaimed U.S. Highway 66 the "Mother Road" be-
cause hundreds of thousands of migrants took it to  California 
to escape the despair of the Oklahoma Dust Bowl in the 1930s. 
In 1946 Nat King Cole recorded the song—Route 66—that be-
came a pop classic a generation later when it was recorded by 
Chuck Berry (in 1961) and the Rolling Stones (1964). Since the 
early 1990s, a loose coalition of federal agencies such as the 
National Park Service and the United States Forest Service, 
state entities, and private individuals has taken steps to inter-
pret, preserve, and commemorate the highway in other ways.
A more recent example is provided by the landscapes of 
contemporary American suburbia. They are landscapes of big-
ness and ostentation, characterized by packaged developments 
and simulated settings. These conservative utopias of themed 
and fortified subdivisions of private master-planned develop-
ments (Figure 7.11) reflect a presumed reciprocity between size 
and social superiority.
The key point is that ordinary landscapes, as geographers 
such as Don Mitchell have established, are instruments of so-
cial and cultural power that naturalize political-economic 
structures as if they were simply given and inevitable. As pow-
erful complexes of signs, they perform vital functions of social 
regulation. Many of the landscapes of contemporary American 
suburbia, for example, have naturalized an ideology of com-
petitive consumption and disengagement from civic affairs.
Landscapes of National Identity
As we saw in Chapter 1, landscapes can become a way of pictur-
ing a nation, and some landscapes are powerfully symbolic of na-
tional identity: the classical Tuscan landscape (Figure 1.13), the 
West of Ireland (Figure 1.14), and the rural landscapes by which 
England is popularly imagined (Figure 1.15). Other examples in-
clude Mount Rushmore in the United States, the bulb fields of 
the Netherlands, and the fjords of Norway. National identity is, 
however, something that is constantly challenged, negotiated, 
and modified. In this context, some places take on particular im-
portance for their iconography and the events that come to be as-
sociated with them. Tahrir Square, in Cairo, Egypt, for example, 
became familiar around the world during the "Arab Spring" of 
2011, when the Square became the principal arena for contesting 
the fundamental values of the nation. In Britain, Trafalgar Square 
has become the multi-layered arena in which national identity 
has been both asserted and challenged (see Box 7.3: "Window on 
the World: Trafalgar Square and British National Identity").

Between 1916 and 1925 the U.S. Congress 
created the National Highway System 
Program, which provided for the construc-
tion of the first public highways throughout 
the country. The official designation of the 
highway that would connect Chicago to Los 
Angeles with over 2,400 miles of roadway 
was Route 66. The diagonal configuration of 
Route 66 was also significant to the growing 
trucking industry, which by 1930 had come 
to rival the railroad for preeminence in U.S. 
shipping.

Route 66 was commissioned on 
November 26, 1926, connecting as 
many sections of existing road as 
possible. The final stretches of the 
road were constructed during the 
height of the Depression by 
thousands of unemployed young 
men who were put to work in a 
federal program.
Route 66 was an important part of 
the U.S. effort in World War II. The 
War Department needed improved 
highways to achieve rapid mobiliza-
tion during the war and to promote 
national defense after the war. 
Because of its all-weather capability, 
Route 66 helped to facilitate the 
single greatest wartime mobilization 
in the history of the nation.
The road was completed 
and its surface continuously 
paved from east to west.
The end of the war found U.S. 
residents more mobile than ever 
before, and Route 66 helped to 
facilitate a new migration of 
easterners to the West, as well as 
to promote automobile travel as a 
tourist experience.
Route 66 is also known as "The 
Mother Road", "The Main Street 
of America" and "The Will Rogers 
Highway".
The first McDonald's restaurant 
was built along Route 66 in San 
Bernardino, California in 1945.

7.3 Window on the World
Trafalgar Square in London was developed at the height of British imperial 
power in the nineteenth century. As the country's collective imagination has 
grappled with historic events it has subsequently become an iconic public 
space of immense symbolic significance.
The square was heavily freighted with symbolic meaning from the start. 
Named after the decisive naval victory over the French at the 1805 Battle of 
Trafalgar, and with Admiral Nelson's Column (Figure 7.B) at its center, it also 
featured the equestrian statue of the absolutist monarch Charles I. 
The present layout of the square (Figure 7.C) derives from designs by 
Charles Barry in the 1840s. His design featured four plinths for statuary (one 
in each corner of the square), and two fountain basins that were intended not 
only for decoration but also to hinder too large a crowd from gathering. This 
was a time when national identity was closely bound up with the fact of em-
pire. Two of Barry's four plinths are occupied by statues of army generals, both 
of whom were prominently involved in British imperial activity in South Asia. 
A third plinth carries an equestrian statue of George IV in Roman dress. The 
fourth plinth was left vacant. Later, the busts of three World War I Royal Navy 
admirals—Jellicoe, Beatty, and Cunningham—were added to the square.
The square's prominence as the 'heart of empire' and its everyday acces-
sibility to both workers and visitors have also made it an important gathering 
place for political protest and, therefore, a site of challenge and resistance: 
a place of contested meanings. Significant demonstrations have been held 
in the square in support of female suffrage, labor movements, and nuclear 
disarmament; and against fascism and unemployment.
On the other hand the square has also been the focal point of national 
celebrations, both planned and spontaneous: VE Day and VJ Day at the end 
of the Second World War, for example; New Year celebrations; and the cel-
ebration of national sporting victories. Recent programming of events in the 
square has emphasized Britain's—and especially London's—cosmopolitan-
ism, celebrating the Chinese New Year, Saint Patrick's Day, Diwali, Vaisakhi, 
and Disability Rights, for example. It is also now routinely used for pop- 
cultural and educational events: all of which, given the Square's symbolic 
 importance, contribute to the evolving discourse on national identity.
Under Mayor Ken Livingstone in the 2000s the square was remodeled as 
part of London's "World Squares for All" program. The Fourth Plinth, which 
had been vacant since the 1840s, has since been used for a series of sculp-
tures and installations that have been deliberately provocative of issues of 
identity, tolerance, diversity, history, and modernity (Figure 7.D).

CHAPTER 7   Interpreting Places and Landscapes   271
Landscape and Art Landscape and art has been of inter-
est to geographers for a long time beginning with the sketches 
done by the artists who accompanied the great explorers like 
Alexander von Humboldt. The field sketches produced by art-
ists onboard ships, such as Captain Cook's Endeavor helped 
people "back home" to develop a geographical imagination of 
places and peoples far distant from them. As well, this type of 
landscape art in the service of science and empire was often 
understood to foreground accuracy and authenticity, being val-
ued as a "true" representation of what was seen by these "on 
the spot" artists.
More recently, landscape paintings by Romantic artists 
J.W.M. Turner and John Constable have captured the attention 
of physical geographers who study them to understand weather 
and climate during the eighteenth century in England. Today, the 
earth structures built by land artists such as Robert Smithson, 
or the purposeful walks and landscape performances of artists 
such as Richard Long and Ana Mendiata, have prompted geog-
raphers to use this art as empirical material upon which to build 
their thinking about landscape, especially issues of power and 
politics, as well as enduring concerns with questions of nature, 
culture, and the environment. Oftentimes these works encour-
age us to ponder on our own relationships with the landscape, 
to reflect on the materiality of the stone, earth, and vegetation 
and the animate forces (weather, organic growth) that are part of 
it, to explore a multi-sensual engagement with landscape that is 
about feeling, smelling and touching, not just seeing.
Over the centuries the sense of landscape art as an infor-
mation source, has been challenged by critics who worry that 
landscape representations such as the Romantic art hid the re-
alities of life in the places depicted in the images. For example, 
the English rural scenes, known as "picturesques", painted by 
John Constable portrayed the eighteenth century countryside 
as a calm, contented, ordered place (Figure 7.12). Produced for 
rich landowners, Constable chose not to depict the rural unrest 
that had spread from Europe to England during this period that 
led to riots and hay burning in protest over ongoing conditions 
of hardship and starvation.
Geographers continue to explore landscape art for its po-
tential to offer commentary and different possibilities for hu-
mans' relationship with the environment. Indeed some go so 
far as to claim that the sorts of environmental encounters art 
works create have the potential to foster an environmental eth-
ics that is increasingly important in a world threatened by cli-
mate change.
Funerary Landscapes Burial practices provide a differ-
ent perspective on landscape and provide some interesting 
insights on human geography. Funerary landscapes are delib-
erately created and highly organized cultural landscapes. For 
countless generations, humans have disposed of their dead in 
the landscape, and the ways they have done it can tell us a lot 
about the socio-cultural ideals. Sociologist W. Lloyd Warner 
was one of the first to develop this perspective, in his 1959 
book on symbolism in American cemeteries.4 Warner pointed 
▲ Figure 7.12 The Cornfield This painting by John Constable (1776-
1837), is a representation of the Romantic tradition.
out that cemeteries are symbolic replicas of the living com-
munity that express many of a community's basic beliefs and 
values. The social and status structures that organize the liv-
ing community, he argued, are reflected and expressed in the 
forms and arrangement of cemeteries. Thus there are "good" 
and "bad" neighborhoods in cemeteries as well as in cities and 
towns. Similarly, sections of many of the cemeteries he ana-
lyzed were marketed exclusively to particular ethnic or reli-
gious groups, while exclusionary clauses kept out people of 
color altogether.
As social structures and cultural ideals change over the 
course of time, so do funerary landscapes evolve. Early in 
United States' history, relatively small and slow-growing com-
munities tended to bury their dead in churchyards or, in the 
rural South, in family burial grounds. Many followed the an-
cient Christian practice of burials with the head of the body to 
the west, feet to the east, thus facing the presumed direction 
from where Christ is supposed to appear again (an orientation, 
incidentally, favored by pre-Christian communities for an en-
tirely different reason: facing sunrise). This typically leads to 
a logical spatial arrangement of burial plots in rows, and a for-
mal, rectilinear, layout (Figure 7.13a).
By the early decades of the nineteenth century the be-
ginnings of industrialization and the growth of urban pop-
ulations led to a significant cultural shift: the so-called 
American Renaissance, rooted in the literary works of Ralph 
Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau and propagated by  
4W. Lloyd Warner, The living and the dead: a study of the symbolic 
life of Americans. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1959.

Walt Whitman and Herman Melville. Thoreau, a disciple of 
Emerson's, popularized the idea of nature as a spiritual well-
spring for city dwellers in his book Walden (1854). It led to 
the popularization of pastoral and picturesque settings, and 
one of the first manifestations of these ideals came in "rural" 
cemeteries like Laurel Hill in Philadelphia, PA, Green-Wood in 
Brooklyn, NY, Evergreen in Portland, ME, and Forest Hill, in 
Madison, WI. Rural cemeteries were consciously designed to 
provide sanctuary, solitude, quiet, adornment, and beauty. The 
social ideals of the time were expressed in spaciousness and 
garden-like settings with shrubs, lawns, and (symbolically) ev-
ergreen trees (Figure 7.13b).
By the late nineteenth century, the romanticism of the 
American Renaissance had been eclipsed by a more aggressive 
and materialistic ethos. Cemeteries changed accordingly, with 
elaborate decorative tombstones and monuments intended to 
communicate the wealth, affluence, and status of the deceased 
(Figure 7.13c). Early in the twentieth century, the influence 
of the City Beautiful movement, with its ideals of order and 
rationalized efficiency, led to simpler and more conservative 
funerary landscapes, and by the end of the twentieth century 
many cemeteries had become so rationalized that tombstones 
and monuments had almost disappeared from park-like land-
scapes (Figure 7.13d).
In recent decades the cost of land and of burials has led 
to an increase in cremation as an American funerary prac-
tice. Meanwhile, another socio-cultural shift is beginning to 
be reflected in funerary landscapes. Increasing environmen-
tal awareness has led to a growing trend for " green" burials. 
According to the Casket and Funeral Association of America, 
more than 91,000 cubic yards of hard wood, 90,000 tons of 
steel, 2,700 tons of copper and bronze, and 800,000 gallons of 
embalming fluid are used in traditional burials every year. Cre-
mation also takes its toll on the environment: it can take up to 
four hours at temperatures ranging from 760 to 1,150 degrees 
Celsius to fully cremate a body. This is roughly equivalent to 
the energy required to drive a car 4,800 miles. With an increas-
ing focus on minimizing people's carbon footprint during life, 
some are turning to natural burial practices as a way of demon-
strating their eco-credentials, using natural coffins or caskets 

CHAPTER 7   Interpreting Places and Landscapes   273
to enable the body to decompose naturally, returning its nutri-
ents to the ground in woodland, meadowland, and open field 
settings.
CODED SPACES
A dynamic and complex approach to understanding landscape 
is based on the conceptualization of landscape as text, by 
which we mean that, like a book, landscape can be read and 
written by groups and individuals. This approach departs from 
traditional attempts to systematize or categorize landscapes 
based on the different elements they contain. The landscape-
as-text view holds that landscapes do not come ready-made 
with labels on them. Rather, there are "writers" who produce 
landscapes and give them meaning, and there are "readers" 
who consume the messages embedded in landscapes. Those 
messages can be read as signs about values, beliefs, and prac-
tices, though not every reader will take the same message from 
a particular landscape (just as people may differ in their inter-
pretation of a passage from a book).
In short, landscapes both produce and communicate 
meaning, and one of our tasks as geographers is to interpret 
those meanings. In order to interpret or read our environment, 
we need to understand the language in which it is written. We 
must learn how to recognize the signs and symbols that go into 
the making of landscape. The practice of writing and reading 
signs is known as semiotics.
Semiotics asserts that innumerable signs are embedded or 
displayed in landscape, space, and place, sending messages 
about identity, values, beliefs, and practices. These signs may 
have different meanings for those who produce them and those 
who read, or interpret, them. Some signs are so subtle as to be 
recognizable only when pointed out by a knowledgeable ob-
server; others may be more readily available and more ubiq-
uitous. For example, semiotics enables us to recognize that by 
the way they dress, people, including college students, send 
messages about who they are and what they value. For some of 
us, certain types, such as the "skater," the "goth," or the "emo," 
are readily identifiable by their clothes, hairstyle, or footwear, 
by the books they carry, or even by the food they eat.
Commercial Spaces
Semiotics, however, is not only about the signs that people con-
vey by their mode of dress. Messages are also deployed through 
the landscape and embedded in places and spaces. Consider 
the very familiar landscape of the shopping mall. Although 
there is certainly a science to the size, scale, and marketing of a 
mall based on demographic research as well as environmental 
and architectural analysis, there is more to the mall than these 
concrete features. The placement and mix of stores and their 
interior design, the arrangement of products within stores, the 
amenities offered to shoppers, and the ambient music all com-
bine to send signals to the consumer about style, taste, and self-
image (Figure 7.14). Called by some "palaces of consumption," 
malls are complex semiotic sites, directing important signals 
not only about what to buy but also about who should shop 
there and who should not.
And yet, as much as Americans seem to enjoy shopping, a 
great many express disdain for shopping and the commercial-
ism and materialism that accompany it. Shopping is a compli-
cated activity about which people feel ambivalence. It is not 
surprising, therefore, that developers have promoted shopping 
as a kind of tourism. The mall is a "pseudoplace" meant to 
encourage one sort of activity—shopping—by projecting the 
illusion that something else besides shopping (and spending 
money) is actually going on.
The South Coast Plaza in Orange County, California, is 
a highly popular retail center in the United States, and with 
almost 3 million square feet of enclosed space covering 128 
acres, it is one of the largest malls in the country. It is the most 
profitable too, boasting over $1.5 billion annually in sales. 
The mall contains 250 retail outlets, including luxury goods 
stores like Gucci, Versace, Chanel, Tiffany, Jimmy Choo, and 
Cartier as well as more popular, less pricey upscale stores like 
Bloomingdales and Nordstrom and finally middlebrow stores 
like Macy's and Sears. The latter stores anchor the mall at 
its outside corners, while the more expensive and luxurious 
shops and boutiques occupy interior locations. Thus the cen-
tral stretches of the mall convey signs of affluence and luxury 
appealing to upper-class patrons while the periphery is more 
oriented to necessity and practicality for middle- and lower-
middle-class patrons.
However complex the messages that malls send, one focus 
is consistent across class, race, gender, age, ethnicity, and other 
cultural boundaries: consumption, a predominant aspect of 
globalization. Indeed, malls are the early twenty-first century's 
spaces of consumption, where just about every aspect of our 
lives has become a commodity. Consumption—or  shopping—
defines who we are more than ever before, and what we con-

the mass media tell us what to consume, equating ownership 
of products with happiness, a good sex life, and success in

general. Within the space of the mall these signals are collected 
and resent. The architecture and design of the mall are an im-
portant part of the semiotic system shaping our choices and 
molding our preferences. As architectural historian Margaret 
Crawford writes:
All the familiar tricks of mall design—limited entrances, 
escalators placed only at the end of corridors, fountains 
and benches carefully positioned to entice shoppers 
into stores—control the flow of consumers through the 
numbingly repetitive corridors of shops. The orderly 
processions of goods along endless aisles continuously 
stimulate the desire to buy. At the same time, other ar-
chitectural tricks seem to contradict commercial consid-
eration. Dramatic atriums create huge floating spaces for 
contemplation, multiple levels provide infinite vistas 
from a variety of vantage points, and reflective surfaces 
bring near and far together. In the absence of sounds 
from the outside, these artful visual effects are comple-
mented by the "white noise" of MUZAK and fountains 
echoing across enormous open courts.5
Malls, condominium developments, neighborhoods, 
university campuses, and any number of other possible geo-
graphic sites possess codes of meaning. By thinking about their 
complex makeup and the individuals and groups they seek to 
influence, it is possible to interpret them and understand the 
implicit messages they contain.

tant information about landscapes?
2. Apply what you just learned about codes and provide a descrip-
tion of the systems of signification that operate in your neighbor-
hood. Think about different spaces in your neighborhood, how it 
is organized, who the population is, where the common spaces are, 
what levels of surveillance are operating, et cetera. What do these 
signs tell you about the "text " of your neighborhood landscape?
GLOBALIZATION AND 
PLACE-MAKING
The spread of Modernity to peripheral regions can be seen as 
part of globalization. These globalization processes have not 
only brought about a generalization of forms of industrial pro-
duction, market behavior, trade, and consumption but rein-
forced and extended the commonalities among places. Three 
factors are especially important in this context.
First, mass communications media have created global 
culture markets in print, film, music, television, and the Inter-
net. Indeed, the Internet has created an entirely new kind of 
space—cyberspace—with its own "landscape" (or technoscape) 
and its own embryonic cultures. The instantaneous character 
of contemporary communications has also made possible the 
creation of a shared, global consciousness from the staging of 
global events such as the Olympic Games and the World Cup. 
Mass communications media have also facilitated the develop-
ment of celebrity culture, which has its own associations with 
specific places (see Box 7.4 "Geography Matters: The Geog-
raphy of Stardom: Celebrity and Place"). Second, mass com-
munications media have diffused certain values and attitudes 
toward a wide spectrum of sociocultural issues, including 
citizenship, human rights, child rearing, social welfare, and 
self-expression. Third, international legal conventions have 
increased the degree of standardization and level of harmoni-
zation not only of trade and labor practices but of criminal jus-
tice, civil rights, and environmental regulations.
These commonalities have been accompanied by the grow-
ing importance of material consumption within many cultures. 
Increasingly, people around the world are eating the same 
foods, wearing the same clothes, and buying the same con-
sumer products. Yet the more people's patterns of consump-
tion converge, the more fertile the ground for countercultural 
movements. The more transnational corporations undercut 
the authority of national and local governments to regulate 
economic affairs, the greater the popular support for regional-
ism. The more universal the diffusion of material culture and 
lifestyles, the more local and ethnic identities are valued. The 
faster the information highway takes people into cyberspace, 
the more they feel the need for a subjective setting—a specific 
place or community—they can call their own. The faster the 
pace of life in search of profit and material consumption, the 
more people value leisure time. And the faster their neighbor-
hoods and towns acquire the same generic supermarkets, gas 
stations, shopping malls, industrial estates, office parks, and 
suburban subdivisions, the more people feel the need for en-
claves of familiarity, centeredness, and identity. The United 
Nations Center for Human Settlements (UNCHS) notes:
In many localities, people are overwhelmed by 
changes in their traditional cultural, spiritual, and 
social values and norms and by the introduction 
of a cult of consumerism intrinsic to the process of 
 globalization. In the rebound, many localities have 
rediscovered the "culture of place" by stressing their 
own identity, their own roots, their own culture and 
values and the importance of their own neighborhood, 
area, vicinity, or town.6
Going Slow
One example of the impulse for people to recover a sense of 
place is provided by the slow city (Cittaslow) movement. The 
Cittaslow movement is a grassroots response to globalization 
and is closely related to the longer-established and better-
known Slow Food movement. The aims of the two movements

are different but complementary: In broad terms, both organi-
zations are in favor of local, traditional cultures, a relaxed pace 
of life, and conviviality. Both are a response to the increasing 
pace of everyday life associated with the acceleration of money 
around local, national, and global circuits of capital. Both are 
hostile to big business and globalization, though their driving 
motivation is not so much political as ecological and human-
istic. Slow food is devoted to a less hurried pace of life and to 
the true tastes, aromas, and diversity of good food (Figure 7.15). 
The movement also serves as a rallying point against globaliza-
tion, mass production, and the kind of generic fast food repre-
sented by U.S.-based franchises like McDonald's, Burger King, 
Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, and Kentucky Fried Chicken. By 2011, 
the slow food movement, based in Bra, near Turin in northern 
Italy, had established convivia (local branches) in more than 
100 countries, with over 100,000 members worldwide. Its cam-
paigns cover a range of specific causes, from protecting the in-
tegrity of chocolate to promoting the cultivation of traditional 
crop varieties and livestock breeds and opposing genetically 
engineered foods.
The slow city movement was formed in October 1999, 
when Paolo Saturnini, mayor of Greve-in-Chianti, a Tuscan hill 
town, organized a meeting with the mayors of three other mu-
nicipalities (Orvieto, Bra, and Positano) to define the attributes 
that might characterize a città lente—slow city. At their found-
ing meeting in Orvieto, the four mayors committed themselves 
to a series of principles that included working toward calmer 
and less polluted physical environments, conserving local aes-
thetic traditions, and fostering local crafts, produce, and cui-
sine. They also pledged to use technology to create healthier 
environments, to make citizens aware of the value of more lei-
surely rhythms to life, and to share their experience in seeking 
administrative solutions for better living. The goal is to foster 
the development of places that enjoy a robust vitality based on 
good food, healthy environments, sustainable economies, and 
the seasonality and traditional rhythms of community life.
▼ Figure 7.15 Slow food festival, Bra, Italy The international Slow Food 
organization is headquartered in the town of Bra, where a festival featuring 
traditional and artisan cheeses is held every other year.
In South Korea, economic success and modernization took 
place very rapidly. Large business conglomerates (called chae-
bols) have been dominant, and entrepreneurial opportunities 
for small firms have been limited. Local traditions and cultures 
have vanished from many places because of the rapid change 
from a predominantly rural and agricultural society to a highly 
modern, internationally connected, and globalized society. 
There is, however, a growing recognition of the value of history, 
culture, traditions, and local arts and crafts. "Slowing down" 
has also caught on with stressed city dwellers. In Samjicheon, a 
South Korean Cittaslow town (Figure 7.16), there are workshops 
where participants can learn how to make traditional dishes 
such as kimchi and practice traditional handwriting, papermak-
ing, or textile dyeing. A special market for local products, arts, 
and crafts is held every other week near the town's Cittaslow 
visitor centre and a daily local market in the newer part of the 
village allows farmers to sell their produce. Meanwhile, the 
town has restored its traditional gravel pathways and creeks, 
and introduced strict building regulations to ensure that new 
buildings conform to the town's historic character.
Places as Objects of Consumption
In much of the world, people's enjoyment of material goods now 
depends not just on their physical consumption or use. It is also 
linked more than ever to the role of material culture as a social 
marker. A person's home, automobile, clothing, reading, view-
ing, eating, and drinking preferences, and choice of vacations are 
all indicators of that person's social distinctiveness and sense of 
style. This pressures individuals to continuously search for new 
and distinctive styles. The wider the range of foods, products, 
and ideas from around the world—and from past worlds—the 
greater the possibilities for establishing such styles.
Given that material consumption is so central to the 
repertoire of symbols, beliefs, and practices of modern

7.4 Geography Matters
Is Celebrity Placeless?
Celebrity is everywhere and nowhere. In his book, The Image, the social 
critic Daniel Boorstin observed that "[Celebrities] help make and ... pub-
licize one another. Being known primarily for their well-knownness, celebri-
ties intensify their celebrity images simply by becoming widely known for 
relations among themselves." One aspect of celebrity status involves being 
photographed repeatedly with other celebrities. This process is why stars—
whether Marilyn Monroe, Madonna, Paris Hilton or Angelina Jolie—become 
such iconic and powerful images around the world (Figure 7.E).
Yet celebrity photos are taken in particular places. Because celebrity 
culture and its stars appear in print, television, movies, and the internet, we 
don't realize that those images are photographed on streets, in restaurants, 
and outside of houses in real places. Like other cultural industries - fash-
ion, art, film, music - celebrity is a global industry but also requires physi-
cal places and real logistics to produce. Andy Warhol's Marilyn silkscreens 
are recognized around the world, plastered on coffee mugs and t-shirts and 
college dorm walls. But Warhol himself made these silkscreen images in his 
New York City art studio called The Factory. Same goes for Prada's latest 
handbags (designed and made in Milan, Italy) or Jay-Z's latest album—we 
may hear "Empire State of Mind" in Tokyo, but the work of writing and pro-
ducing the song came from a recording studio in New York City. Celebrity 
may seem placeless but, like technology in Silicon Valley or finance on Wall 
Street, it requires people, resources, and networks that are located in par-
ticular cities around the world. In fact, it requires the backdrop of the cul-
tural industries to generate celebrity culture and its people and events: film 
awards, art exhibitions, fashion runway shows, and theaters.
Te Practicality of a Seemingly Nebulous Industry
What makes a star a star is hard to define. The celebrity industry and ce-
lebrity culture feel ephemeral and intangible. The same type of ambigu-
ity emerges in other cultural industries. For example, why Andy Warhol or 
Picasso and not someone else? Why Bob Dylan and not another aspiring 
musician? Because culture is about taste, why one person becomes success-
ful—or attains what sociologists call symbolic capital— is not always clear. 
However, in studying cultural industries we learn that beneath the aesthetics 
there is a practical scaffolding . Warhol needed paints and canvases to pro-
duce his work, a gallery to show it, a dealer to sell it, and art critics to write 
about it and tell the world about his talent. Similarly, Jennifer Aniston needs

a TV show or movies to be filmed in, a stylist to make her look beautiful, a 
trainer to keep her in shape, an agent to negotiate her deals, a lawyer to 
read her contracts, a photographer to take her pictures, and the media to 
publish photos. The TV show needs a back lot, a studio, and skilled produc-
ers and directors, most of which are behind the scenes.
Celebrity is a practical matter that relies on resources and people to get 
things done. This concentration of skilled labor (people), resources and re-
lated businesses in one place are what economists and geographers call ag-
glomeration economies or industrial clusters. Often these concepts are 
applied to more conventional industries like automobiles or apparel manu-
facturing: Think about Detroit's auto industry or Silicon Valley's technology 
hub - they may produce more tangible products, but the underlying need 
for extensive resources and talented people are the same.
While agglomeration economies help support an industry they also 
make those specific places that have such clusters the only places in the 
world where the industry truly thrives—which is why Detroit dominated the 
automobile industry for so long and New York City's Wall Street remains 
one of the few global capitals of finance. Similarly, only a few places in the 
world produce celebrity culture: Los Angeles, London, and New York are 
the epicenters of stardom—homes not just to the stars but to the industries 
(fashion, art, film and music), people (producers, directors, art dealers) and 
media who create them (Figure 7.F).
How Do We Study the Importance of Celebrity?
As intangible as celebrity culture seems to be, it also possesses something 
most industries do not: worldwide interest and media following. We can un-
derstand celebrity culture through the very photos that uphold the celeb-
rity industry, the very material that Boorstin said reaffirmed their "known for 
their well-knownness" quality.
Like other sectors, the celebrity industry can be studied through 
basic industrial and economic analysis. Recall that agglomeration econ-
omies offer a high concentration of practical resources and people 
needed for the success of a particular industry. From a research per-
spective, these supporting jobs show up in government employment 
and establishment data.
There is, however, something unique about the celebrity industry 
that sets it apart from other industries. The visual nature of celebrity 
 allows us to study it in innovative ways - photographs, blogs, and news-
paper stories become data in a way that is not possible with medi-
cine, finance, technology, and even fashion. The stars and their events, 
fleeting as they are, give us tangible evidence of the celebrity industry 
and its economic and social importance around the world and in a few 
key  cities. After studying it, one observes celebrity industry is not so 
 placeless at all.
1.  How do you see the celebrity industry as similar or different to other 
industries in general? How about to other cultural industries?
2.  How do you think social media has reframed older versions of  
celebrity culture (e.g. Hollywood)?

societies, the "culture industries"—advertising, publishing, 
communications media, and popular entertainment—have 
become important shapers of spaces, places, and landscapes. 
Because the symbolic meanings of material culture must be 
advertised (in the broadest sense of the word) in order to be 
shared, advertising (in its narrower sense) has become a key 
component of contemporary culture and place-making. In 
addition to stimulating consumer demand, advertising has 
always had a role in teaching people how to dress, how to 
furnish a home, and how to signify status through groupings 
of possessions.
In the 1970s and 1980s, however, the emphasis in advertis-
ing strategies shifted away from presenting products as newer, 
better, more efficient, and more economical to identifying them 
as the means to self-awareness, self-actualization, and group 
stylishness. Increasingly, products are advertised in terms of 
their association with a particular lifestyle rather than in terms 
of their intrinsic utility. Many of these advertisements deliber-
ately draw on international or global themes, and some entire 
advertising campaigns (for Coca-Cola, Benetton, and American 
Express, for example) have been explicitly based on the theme 
of cultural globalization. Many others rely on stereotypes of 
particular places or kinds of places (especially exotic, spec-
tacular, or "cool" places) in creating the appropriate context or 
setting for their product. Images of places therefore join with 
images of global food, architecture, pop culture, and consumer 
goods in the global media marketplace. Advertisements both 
instruct and influence consumers about products and also 
about spaces, places, and landscapes.
One result of these trends is that contemporary cultures 
rely much more than before not only on material consumption 
but also on visual and experiential consumption: the purchase 
of images and the experience of spectacular and distinctive 
places, physical settings, and landscapes. Visual consump-
tion can take the form of magazines, television, movies, sites 
on the World Wide Web, tourism, window shopping, people- 
watching, or visits to galleries and museums. The images, signs, 
and experiences that are consumed may be originals, copies, or  
simulations.
The significance of the increased importance of visual con-
sumption for place-making and the evolution of landscapes is 
that settings such as theme parks, shopping malls, festival mar-
ketplaces, renovated historic districts, museums, and galleries 
have all become prominent as centers of cultural practices and 
activities.
Examples of the re-creation and refurbishment of historic 
districts and settings are widespread and have become a main-
stay of the "heritage industry." This industry, based on the 
commercial exploitation of the histories of peoples and places, 
is now worldwide, as evidenced by the involvement of the 
United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organi-
zation (UNESCO) in identifying places for inclusion on World 
Heritage lists. In countries like the United Kingdom, with a 
high density of historic districts and settings, place marketing 
relies heavily on the heritage industry. In the United Kingdom, 
more than 90 million people pay to view about 650 historic 
properties each year, and millions more visit free-of-charge 
heritage sites such as cathedrals, field monuments, remote 
ruins, and no longer useful industrial waterways. In 2010, 
more than 200 million tourists visited designated heritage sites 
in the United Kingdom, spending about $53 billion on entry 
fees, retail sales, travel, and hotel accommodations.
A key question when it comes to heritage lists is "Whose 
heritage?" The buildings chosen to represent a community's 
heritage will almost inevitably exclude or alienate some mem-
bers of that community. Herbert Gans, a prominent American 
urban sociologist and critic, wrote an article for the New York 
Times in 1975 in which he attacked the New York Landmarks 
Commission for what he called the rewriting of New York's ar-
chitectural history. He was concerned that the only buildings 
that the Commission tended to designate were the stately man-
sions of the rich and buildings designed by famous architects, 
so that the Commission was simply preserving the elite portion 
of the architectural past. More recently, urban historian Delo-
res Hayden analyzed heritage buildings in Los Angeles that 
had been selected by panels of experts and found that most 
were not even remotely representative of the largely black and 
Hispanic populations of the communities in which they were 
located.
The architectural elite does not always prevail, however. 
In London's East End a 1972 housing project designed by ac-
claimed architects Peter and Alison Smithson was scheduled for 
demolition in 2014. Building Design magazine, backed by star 
architects like Zaha Hadid and Richard Rogers, ran a campaign 
to get the project officially listed in order to save it from destruc-
tion. English Heritage, the official body responsible for listing 
protected buildings, declined, noting that while Robin Hood 
Gardens might be admired by architects for its sculptural quali-
ties, it had failed as a place for human beings to live. More than 
seventy-five percent of the project's residents had supported the 
demolition when consulted by the local public authority.
One important consequence of the heritage industry is that 
urban cultural environments are vulnerable to a debasing and 
trivializing "Disneyfication" process. The United Nations Hu-
man Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) Cities in A Global-
izing World - Global Report on Human Settlements 2001 notes:
The particular historic character of a city often gets 
submerged in the direct and overt quest for an inter-
national image and international business. Local iden-
tity becomes an ornament, a public relations artifact 
designed to aid marketing. Authenticity is paid for, 
encapsulated, mummified, located, and displayed to 
attract tourists rather than to shelter continuities of 
tradition or the lives of its historic creators.7
As a result, contemporary landscapes contain increasing 
numbers of inauthentic settings—what geographer David Har-
vey has called the "degenerative utopias" of global capitalism. 
These are as much the product of contemporary material and 
visual culture as they are of any cultural heritage. Particu-
larly influenced by images and symbols derived from mov-
ies, advertising, and popular culture, examples include the 
re-creation of the Wild West in the fake cowboy town of Old

Globalization has already brought a significant degree of ho-
mogenization of culture through the language of consumer 
goods. This is the material culture of the West, enmeshed in 
Airbus jets, CNN, music video channels, cell phones, and the 
Internet and swamped by Coca-Cola, Budweiser, McDonald's, 
GAP clothing, Nikes, iPods, PlayStations, Toyotas, Disney fran-
chising, and formula-driven Hollywood movies (Figure 7.19). 
Furthermore, sociologists have recognized that a distinctive 
culture of "global metropolitanism" is emerging among the 
transnational elite. This is simply homogenized culture at a 
higher plane of consumption (French wines instead of Bud-
weiser, molecular gastronomy and international cuisine in-
stead of McDonald's, Hugo Boss clothes instead of Levis, Range 
Rovers instead of Toyotas, and so on). The members of this new 
culture are people who make international conference calls, 
make decisions and transact investments that are transnational 
in scope, edit the news, design and market international prod-
ucts, and travel the world for business and pleasure, and it is 
likely to grow significantly in size and influence.
The idea of the emergence of a single global culture is too 
simplistic, but the pervasive emphasis on material, visual, and 
experiential consumption means that many aspects of contem-
porary culture will increasingly transcend local and national 
boundaries. More and more of the world's population are world 
travelers—either directly or via the TV in their living room—
so that many are knowledgeable about aspects of others' cul-
tures. This contributes to cosmopolitanism, an intellectual and 
aesthetic openness toward divergent experiences, images, and 
products from different cultures.
Cosmopolitanism is an important geographic phenomenon 
because it fosters a curiosity about all places, peoples, and cul-
tures, together with at least a rudimentary ability to map, or sit-
uate, such places and cultures geographically, historically, and 
anthropologically. It also suggests an ability to reflect upon, 
and judge aesthetically between, different places and societies. 
Optimists would speculate that this bodes well for global peace 
and understanding: We can, perhaps, more easily identify with 
people who use the same products, listen to the same music, 
and appreciate the same sports stars that we do. At the same 
time, however, focusing attention on material consumption ob-
scures the emergence of other trends. As people's lives are ho-
mogenized through their jobs and their material culture, many 
of them want to revive subjectivity, reconstruct we/us feelings, 
and reestablish a distinctive cultural identity. One feasible out-
come of this is an increased probability of cultural and territo-
rial conflict.

CHAPTER 7   Interpreting Places and Landscapes   281
CONCLUSION
Geographers study the interdependence between people and 
places and are especially interested in how individuals and 
groups acquire knowledge of their environments and how 
this knowledge shapes their attitudes and behaviors. People 
ascribe meanings to landscapes and places in many ways, and 
they also derive meanings from the places and landscapes 
they experience. Different groups of people experience land-
scape, place, and space differently. For instance, the experi-
ence that rural Sudanese children have of their landscapes 
and the ways in which they acquire knowledge of their sur-
roundings differ from how middle-class children in an Amer-
ican suburb learn about and function in their landscapes. 
Furthermore, both landscapes elicit a distinctive sense of 
place that is different for those who live there and those who 
simply visit.
As indicated in previous chapters, the concepts of land-
scape and place are central to geographic inquiry. They are 
the result of intentional and unintentional human action, and 
every landscape is a complex reflection of the operations of 
the larger society. Geographers have developed categories of 
landscape to help distinguish the different types that exist. 
Ordinary landscapes, such as suburban neighborhoods, are 
ones that people experience in the course of their everyday 
lives. By contrast, symbolic landscapes represent the particu-
lar values and aspirations that their developers and finan-
ciers want to impart to a larger public. An example is Mount 
Rushmore in the Black Hills of South Dakota, designed and 
executed by sculptor Gutzon Borglum. Chiseling the heads of 
George  Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, 
and  Abraham Lincoln into the granite face of the mountain, 
Borglum intended to construct an enduring landscape of na-
tionalism in the wilderness.
More recently, geographers have come to regard landscape 
as a text, something that can be written and read, rewritten, 
and reinterpreted. This concept suggests that a landscape can 
have more than one author, and different readers may derive 
different meanings from what is written there. The idea that 
landscape can be written and read is further supported by the 
understanding that the language in which the landscape is 
written is a code. To understand the significance of the code 
is to understand its semiotics, the language in which the code 
is written. The code may be meant to convey many things, in-
cluding a language of power or of playfulness, a language that 
elevates one group above another, or a language that encour-
ages imagination or religious devotion and spiritual awe.
Globalization has altered cultural landscapes, places, and 
spaces differently as individuals and groups have struggled to 
negotiate the local impacts of this widespread shift in cultural 
sensibilities. The shared meanings that insiders derive from 
their place or landscape have been disrupted by the intrusion 
of new sights, sounds, and smells as values, ideas, and prac-
tices from one part of the globe have been exported to another. 
The Internet and the emergence of cyberspace have meant that 
new spaces of interaction have emerged that have neither a 
distinct historical memory attached to them nor a well-estab-
lished sense of place. Because of this, cyberspace carries with 
it some unique possibilities for cultural exchange. It remains 
to be seen, however, whether access to this new space will be 
truly open—or whether the Internet will become another land-
scape of power and exclusion.
LEARNING OUTCOMES REVISITED
■ Investigate how environment shapes people and how people 
shape environments.
People not only filter information from their environments 
through neurophysiological and psychological processes 
but draw on personality and culture to produce cognitive 
images of their environment—pictures or representations 
of the world that can be called to mind through the imagi-
nation. Thus human-environment relationship results in 
a variety of ways of understanding the world around us as 
well as different ways of being in the world as information 
about our environment is filtered by people.
■ Recognize that place-making stands at the center of issues of 
culture and power relations and is a key part of the systems of 
meaning through which humans make sense of the world.
Places are the result of a wide range of forces from eco-
nomic to social. Economically, places emerge through all 
sorts of transactions that result from the complexities of 
the land market. But places are also more than just real 
estate. They can reflect tensions between social groups as 
well as harmonious interaction.
■ Define the concept of territoriality both as an instinctive pro-
cess and the result of socio-political systems.
Territoriality is the persistent attachment of individuals 
or peoples to a specific location or territory. Some social 
scientists have argued that territoriality is a natural hu-
man instinct, impacting our sense of safety and security, 
our sense of stimulation and our identity. Proxemics is the 
study of the social and political meanings people give to 
space and includes protocols about space. Territoriality 
is in many ways a material form of power, as it regulates 
interaction, access to resources and people, and can be a 
symbol of group membership (seen in borders delineating 
"us" and "them").
■ Identify how different cultural identities and status catego-
ries influence the ways people experience and understand 
landscapes, as well as how they are shaped by—and able to 
shape—landscapes.
Among the most important relations are the cultural iden-
tities of race, class, gender, ethnicity, and sexuality. Of-
ten these identities come together in a group, and their

REVIEW & DISCUSSION
1. Consider the environment of your own town or campus. 
Conduct research exploring how the environment has been 
shaped or reshaped over the last 5 to 10 years. (Hint: You 
might want to research the building of new parking struc-
tures or sports complexes or consider how your university 
has expanded and bought more land or is not using all of 
its buildings.) Are there opposing perceptions regarding 
how your university has been shaped?
2. Conduct research to identify and explore the different 
elements (paths, edges, districts, nodes, and landmarks) 
within your campus or town. Begin by making a list of the 
different elements and who occupies these spaces. What 
are the territorial, social, and cultural markers of each 
space? List three of the proxemics you observe in these 
spaces. (Hint: You might start by considering the different 
coffee shops or restaurants at your university or neighbor-
hood. Who hangs out at these different locations? List and 
assess the types of social interactions that are taking place. 
List the symbols or cultural behaviors that are associated 
with the location and the people who occupy it.) Once you 
have the information compiled, draw a territorial cognitive 
image map like the ones in Figures 6.5 and 6.6.
 3. Look up advertisements from real estate developers sell-
ing homes in your city. These advertisements may be for 
different kinds of housing: apartments, condominiums, 
bungalows, and villas. Approach two different groups (for 
example, a group of young, unmarried people and a group 
of young families). Ask the groups to read the landscapes 
of each kind of housing/home depicted in the advertise-
ments as text. List the different words and meanings that 
the two groups use to describe the advertisements for the 
different homes. Examine how the readings vary for each 
group.
 4. Consider a place that has become a commodity. Think 
about your last vacation or landscape you desire to visit. 
How did you discover this place? What made you want to 
visit this place? How was it different from your home—
think about the food, the language, the environment, the 
people, the architecture? Do an Internet search on this 
place to find "iconic" images of the place. What was the 
same about this place as your home? Did you see any evi-
dence of globalized culture there? Did you see efforts to 
preserve regional identity?
influence in combination becomes central to our under-
standing of how group identity shapes space and is shaped 
by it.
■ Understand how codes signify important information about 
landscapes, a process known as semiotics.
To interpret our environment, we must learn how to read 
the codes that are written into the landscape. Landscapes 
as different from each other as shopping malls and war 
memorials can be understood in terms of their semiot-
ics, although it is important to appreciate that even when 
certain landscapes have intended meanings by those who 
have created them, those who perceive them may make 
their own sense of that landscape.
■ Analyze the effects of global consumption on cultural land-
scapes from homogenization to preservation and describe 
how a place can become a commodity.
A shared consciousness has diffused certain values and at-
titudes around the globe, and the commonalities have been 
accompanied by the growing importance of material con-
sumption. One of the effects of global culture is the commod-
ification of spaces, or the "Disneyfication" in the heritage 
industry where regions capitalize on stereotypical imagery of 
their regions to "sell" to global consumers. Simultaneously, 
many people have responded to the homogenized global cul-
ture with counter movements including rediscovering their 
own "culture of place", preserving distinct cultural values 
and difference to global culture, and participating in coun-
tercultures like the Cittaslow movement.

CHAPTER 7   Interpreting Places and Landscapes   283
UNPLUGGED
1. Interview individuals in order to gather detailed accounts 
of their experiences of different places (for example, their 
experiences in school, at the dentist's or doctor's, in the 
park, at their grandparents' home, in the hostels they might 
have lived in, or the places they have vacationed in).  
Relate these experiences your interviewees have had with 
how they remember these places and the meanings they 
hold for them. Comment on how experiences and their  
interpretation contribute to place-making processes.
2. Refer to the map of student preferences shown in 
 Figure 7.8, and draw up a similar list of the top 10 places 
in your country in which you would like to live and work; 
then draw up a list of the bottom 10. Give reasons for your 
preferences. Show how your choices are influenced by 
your cognitive images and perceptions of these places.
3. Compare the places where you have been an "outsider" 
and an "insider". Think about spaces where age, gender, 
religion, skill level (sports, expertise in films or chess, rock 
climbing), community (teams, clubs, family, political af-
filiation), personal experience (jobs, family circumstances, 
health circumstances) and interests (music preference, 
fashion choices, favorite TV shows, dietary choices like 
veganism) dictate the landscape of that space. Where were 
the places you were an outsider? Did you adapt to the 
space or did people in that space adapt to you? Did your 
identity change as a result? What were the spaces you were 
the insider? How did you react to outsiders? What did you 
share with other insiders? How did you all draw identity 
from the place you had created?
 4. On a clean sheet of paper and without reference to maps or 
other materials, sketch a detailed map of the town or city 
in which you live. Does your sketch contain nodes? Land-
marks? Edges? Districts? Paths? How does "your" cognitive 
image map compare to your "real" town or city?

DATA ANALYSIS
In this chapter, we have seen how place making 
stands at the center of issues of culture and power 
relations. We also have discussed how different 
cultural identities and status categories influence 
the ways people experience and understand their 
landscapes. We have also seen how preserva-
tion of culture is an issue of power, race, class, and gender. And 
through the work of Edward Soja, we can analyze those relation-
ships with landscape as part of a "sociospatial dialectic" in that 
we change spaces, but those places also inform our worldviews. 
Thinking about race, class, and art in the landscape, explore 
Project Row House (PRH), a community based art and culture 
organization in the northern Third Ward, a traditionally African-
American neighborhood in Houston, Texas. Go to the Project 
Web site, view the art, read about the programs, and answer 
these questions. 
 1. What is PRH? Why was it started?
 2. Read the information on the "About" page. What architec-
ture is being preserved? What is the style? Who did these 
homes belong to?
 3. Why did the artists want to work in this space? What is 
the relationship between the building preservation and 
community?
 4. The "Young Mothers Residential Program" is an example 
of incorporating art and community action as part of a 
cultural landscape. What does this program do? What kind 
of "cognitive imagery" might this program offer to its par-
ticipants, compared to living outside the program? What 
do you think about this alternative?
 5. Go to the "Architecture" tab and read each section. How 
does community activist Rick Lowe differentiate his goals 
of housing with a developer?
 6. What is "Row House CDC"? Why was it created? What 
does it provide?
 7. What are some of the performances hosted by PRH? Look 
at both the "professional" artists and members of the com-
munity. How does this create a new landscape that chal-
lenges "cosmopolitanism" and at the same time celebrate 
the arts?
 8. Watch this two-minute documentary on PRH 
with Rick Lowe. 
  What does Rick Lowe say about "the issues" 
and solutions?
 9. What happened to the neighborhood when 
PRH began? What kind of gallery space is

GEOGRAPHIES 
OF ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENT

The garment industry in Bangladesh is a major supplier of mass- 
market clothing for Western retailers like Gap, H&M, Old Navy, and WalMart. 
In the 1970s the newly independent country had no modern industry at all, 
but by 2000 the garment industry was generating more than U.S. $12.5 billion 
in export revenue. Today Bangladesh earns $20 billion a year from garment 
exports. Women account for 80 percent of its 4 million employees, most of 
them working in terrible conditions for long hours and extremely low pay. A 
wide set of factors, from financial innovation to government policy, contrib-
uted to this dramatic change in the country's economic geography. It began 
in 1979, when Daewoo Corporation of Korea teamed up with Bangladesh's 
Desh Garments Ltd. to produce garments in Bangladesh for export. Desh sent 
130 newly recruited, technically qualified employees to Daewoo's garment 
factory in Korea, where they participated in an 8-month intensive training 
course covering topics from sewing skills to factory management, quality 
control, and international procurement and marketing—skills that they then 
applied in the Desh factories in Bangladesh.
Within a few years, almost all the trainees had left Desh to start their own gar-
ment businesses. Some of the ex-Desh workers joined new garment factories 
established by affluent businessmen, while others founded trading houses, 
which then contributed to the proliferation of garment manufacturers by pro-
viding a variety of valuable services, including international procurement 
and marketing, sample making, and design reengineering. Observing Desh's 
good start in exporting, and subsequently the success of ex-Desh workers, 
highly educated people started their own garment businesses, and wealthy 
families actively invested in the industry. Learning from one another, they 
clustered in a 20-kilometer corridor just north of Dhaka, the country's capital.  
Learning from abroad continued as some entrepreneurs participated in 
training programs in Singapore, Japan, and Europe. Other countries in East 
Asia followed Daewoo into operation in Bangladesh and invested in train-
ing Bangladeshi workers and managers. Thus, many Bangladeshi traders and 

286 
HUMAN GEOGRAPHY   Places and Regions in Global Context
manufacturers had work experience in garment trading 
and production, including the experience of working in 
joint ventures, before starting their own businesses.
Geographers are interested in understanding the prin-
ciples behind such apparently serendipitous and 
complex processes of economic development: from 
international ties to the local concentrations of  industry; 
from the circumstances of  entrepreneurship and 
 investment to the conditions in local labor  markets; and 
from the  economic structure of countries and  regions 
to the  factors that influence the location of economic 
activities.

PATTERNS OF ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENT
We often discuss economic development in terms of levels and 
rates of change in prosperity, as reflected in bottom-line sta-
tistical measures of productivity, incomes, purchasing power, 
and consumption. Increased prosperity is only one aspect of 
economic development, however. For human geographers and 
other social scientists, the term economic development refers 
to processes of change involving the nature and composition 
of the economy of a particular region as well as to increases in 
the overall prosperity of a region. These processes can involve 
three types of changes:
■ changes in the structure of the region's economy ( example, 
a shift from agriculture to manufacturing);
■ changes in forms of economic organization within the 
region (for example, a shift from socialism to free-market 
capitalism);
■ changes in the availability and use of technology within 
the region.
Technological Change and Economic 
Development
The Industrial Revolution, which began in England at the end 
of the eighteenth century, eventually resulted not only in the 
complete reorganization of the geography of the original Euro-
pean core of the world-system but also in an extension of the 
world-system core to the United States and Japan. Since then 
there have been several more technology systems, each opening 
new geographic frontiers and rewriting the geography of eco-
nomic development while shifting the balance of advantages 
between regions. Overall, the opportunities for development 
created by each new technology system have been associated 
with distinctive economic epochs and long-term fluctuations 
in the overall rate of change of prices in the economy.
Beginning in the late eighteenth century, a series of tech-
nological innovations in power and energy, transportation, and 
manufacturing processes resulted in crucial changes in pat-
terns of economic development. Each of these major clusters of 
technological innovations created new demands for natural re-
sources as well as new labor forces and markets. The result was 
that each major cluster of technological innovations—called 
technology systems—tended to favor different regions and dif-
ferent kinds of places. Technology systems are clusters of inter-
related energy, transportation, and production technologies that 
dominate economic activity for several decades at a time—until 
a new cluster of improved technologies evolves. What is espe-
cially remarkable about technology systems is that so far they 
have come along at about 50-year intervals. Since the beginning 
of the Industrial Revolution, we can identify four of them:
1790-1840: early mechanization based on water power 
and steam engines; development of cotton textiles and iron-
working; development of river transport systems, canals, and 
turnpike roads.
1840-1890: exploitation of coal-powered steam engines; 
steel products; railroads; world shipping; and machine tools.
1890-1950: exploitation of the internal combustion  engine; 
oil and plastics; electrical and heavy engineering; aircraft; 
 radio and telecommunications.
1950-1990: exploitation of nuclear power, aerospace, elec-
tronics, and petrochemicals; development of limited-access 
highways and global air routes.
A fifth technology system, still incomplete, began to take 
shape in the 1980s with a series of innovations that are now 
being commercially exploited:
1990 onward: exploitation of solar energy, robotics, micro-
electronics, biotechnology, nanotechnology, advanced materi-
als (e.g., fine chemicals and thermoplastics), and information 
technology (e.g., digital telecommunications and geographic 
information systems).
Each of these technology systems has rewritten the 
 geography of economic development as it has shifted 
the  balance of advantages between regions (see Box 8.1, 
 "Visualizing  Geography: Technological Change and Economic 
Development"). From the mid-1800s, industrial  development 
spread to new regions. The growth of those regions then 
 became interdependent with the fortunes of other regions 
through a complex web of production and trade.
The Unevenness of Economic 
Development
Geographically, the single most important feature of eco-
nomic development is that it is uneven. At the global scale, 
this unevenness takes the form of core-periphery contrasts 
within the evolving world-system (see Chapter 2). These 
global core- periphery contrasts are the result of a competitive 
economic system that is heavily influenced by cultural and 
political  factors. The core regions within the world-system—
North America, Europe, and Japan—have the most diversi-
fied  economies, the most advanced technologies, the highest 
levels of productivity, and the highest levels of prosperity.  
They are commonly referred to as developed regions (though 

CHAPTER 8   Geographies of Economic Development   287
processes of economic development are, of course, continuous, 
and no region can ever be regarded as fully developed).
Other countries and regions—the periphery and semiper-
iphery of the world-system—are often referred to as develop-
ing or less developed. Indeed, the nations of the periphery are 
often referred to as LDCs (less developed countries). Another 
popular term for the global periphery, developed as a politi-
cal label but now synonymous with economic development in 
popular usage, is the Third World. This term had its origins in 
the early Cold War era of the 1950s and 1960s, when the newly 
independent countries of the periphery positioned themselves 
as a distinctive political bloc, aligned with neither the First 
World of developed, capitalist countries nor the Second World 
of the Soviet Union and its satellite countries.
Measuring Levels of Economic 
Development
At the global scale, levels of economic development are usu-
ally measured by economic indicators such as gross domestic 
product and gross national income. Gross domestic product 
(GDP) is an estimate of the total value of all materials, food-
stuffs, goods, and services that are produced by a country in 
a particular year. To standardize for countries' varying sizes, 
total GDP is normally divided by total population that gives 
an indicator, per capita GDP, which is a good yardstick of rela-
tive levels of economic development. Gross national income 
(GNI) is a measure of the income that flows to a country from 
production wherever in the world that production occurs. For 
example, if a U.S.-owned company operating in another coun-
try sends some of its income (profits) back to the United States, 
this adds to the U.S. GNI.
In making international comparisons, GDP and GNI can be 
problematic because they are based on each nation's currency. As 
a result, it is now common to compare national currencies based 
on purchasing power parity (PPP). In effect, PPP measures how 
much of a common "market basket" of goods and services each 
currency can purchase locally, including goods and services that 
are not traded internationally. When we use PPP-based currency 
values to compare levels of economic prosperity, we usually see 
lower GNI figures in wealthy countries (because of the generally 
higher cost of living) and higher GNI figures in poorer nations 
(because of the generally lower cost of living). Nevertheless, even 
with this compression between rich and poor, economic prosper-
ity is very unevenly distributed across nations.
As Figure 8.1 shows, most of the highest levels of eco-
nomic development are to be found in northern latitudes (very 
roughly, north of 30° N), which has given rise to another popu-
lar shorthand for the world's economic geography: the "North" 
(the core) and the "South" (the periphery). Viewed in more 
 detail, the global pattern of per capita GNI (measured in the 
 "international dollars" of PPP) in 2012 is a direct reflection of  
the core-semiperiphery-periphery structure of the world- system. 
In many of the core countries of North America, northwestern 
Europe, and Japan, annual per capita GNI (in PPP) exceeds 
$30,000. The only other countries that match these levels are  
Australia and Singapore, where annual per capita GNI in 
2012 was $43,300 and $60,110, respectively. Semiperipheral

countries such as Brazil, Russia, and Thailand have an annual 
per capita GNI ranging between $10,000 and $25,000. In the 
rest of the world—the periphery—annual per capita GNI (in 
PPP) is typically less than $5,000.
The gap between the highest per capita GNIs (more than 
$60,000 in Luxembourg, Norway and Singapore) and the lowest 
(less than $600 in Burundi, Eritrea, Liberia, and the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo) is huge. The gap between the world's 
rich and poor is also getting wider. In 1970, the average GNI per 
capita of the ten most prosperous countries in the world was 50 
times greater than the average GNI per capita of the ten poorest 
countries. By 2012, the relative gap had increased to a factor 
of 70. Overall, more than 80 percent of the world's population 
lives in countries where income differentials are widening.

ment? Give examples from your country describing the impact of eco-
nomic development on human development in general. (Hint: Find out 
about the Human Development Index or Happiness Index and how 
economic development may or may not influence these two indices.)
Resources and Development
Current patterns of economic development are the result of 
many different factors. One of the most important is the avail-
ability of key resources such as cultivable land, energy, and 
valuable minerals. Unevenly distributed across the world are 
both key resources and—equally important—the combinations 
of energy and minerals crucial to economic development. A 
lack of natural resources can, of course, be remedied through 
international trade (Japan's success is a prime example). For 
most countries, however, the resource base remains an impor-
tant determinant of development.
Energy One particularly important resource in terms of the 
world's economic geography is energy. The major sources of 
commercial energy—oil, natural gas, and coal—are unevenly 
distributed across the globe. Most of the world's core economies 
are reasonably well off in terms of energy production, the ma-
jor exceptions being Japan and parts of Europe. Most  peripheral 
countries, on the other hand, are energy poor. The major excep-
tions are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Libya, Nigeria, 
Venezuela, and the Gulf states—all major oil producers.
Because of this unevenness, energy has come to be an impor-
tant component of world trade. As more of the world becomes 
industrialized and developed, demand for oil continues to in-
crease. Yet, as we saw in Chapter 4, it is generally agreed that the 
peak of oil discovery was passed in the 1960s and that the world 
started using more oil than was contained in new fields in 1981. 
Oil prices have risen sharply: more than 500 percent between 
2000 and 2013. Oil is now the single most important commod-
ity in world trade, making up more than 20 percent of the total 
by value in 2013. Newly discovered oil reserves in Canada and 
Brazil have eased short-term concerns about oil supplies, as has 
the introduction of hydraulic fracturing techniques (commonly 
known as "fracking") to release hard-to-get-at reserves of oil and 
natural gas. But both oil exploration and fracking (Figure 8.2) are 
increasingly the focus of environmental concerns.
For many peripheral countries the cost of importing en-
ergy is a heavy burden. Consider, for example, the predicament 
of countries like India, Ghana, Paraguay, Egypt, and Armenia, 
where in 2010 the cost of energy imports amounted to more 
than one-quarter of the total value of exported merchandise. 
Few peripheral countries can afford to consume energy on the 
scale of the developed economies, so patterns of commercial 
energy consumption mirror the fundamental core-periphery 
cleavage of the world economy. In 2008, energy consumption 
per capita in North America was 14 times that of India, 18 
times that of Mozambique, and nearly 50 times that of Bangla-
desh. The world's high-income countries, with 15 percent of 
the world's population, use half its commercial energy and 10 
times as much per capita as low- income countries.
It should be noted that these figures do not reflect the 
use of firewood and other traditional fuels for cooking, light-
ing, heating and, sometimes, industrial needs. In total, such 
forms probably account for around 20 percent of total world 
energy consumption. In parts of Africa and Asia, they account 
for up to 80 percent of energy consumption. This points to 
yet another core-periphery contrast. Whereas massive invest-
ments in exploration and exploitation are enabling more of

fracturing, or "fracking", is the process of extracting natural gas from shale rock 
layers deep within the earth.

CHAPTER 8   Geographies of Economic Development   289
the developed, energy-consuming countries to become self-
sufficient through various combinations of coal, oil, natural 
gas, hydroelectric power, and nuclear power, 1.5 billion peo-
ple in peripheral countries depend on collecting fuelwood 
as their principal source of energy. The collection of wood 
fuel causes considerable deforestation. The problem is most 
serious in densely populated locations, 
arid and semiarid regions, and cooler 
mountainous areas, where the regenera-
tion of shrubs, woodlands, and forests 
is particularly slow. Nearly 100 million 
people in 22 countries (16 of them in Af-
rica) cannot meet their minimum energy 
needs even by overcutting remaining for-
ests (Figure 8.3).
Cultivable Land The distribution of 
cultivable land is another important factor 
in international economic development. 
Much more than half of Earth's land sur-
face is unsuitable for any productive form 
of arable farming, as shown in Figure 8.4. 
Poor soils, short growing seasons, arid cli-
mates, mountainous terrain, forests, and 
conservation limit the extent of agricultural 
land across much of the globe. As a result, 
the distribution of the world's cultivable 
land is highly uneven, being concentrated in Europe, west-
central Russia, eastern North America, the Australian littoral, 
Latin America, India, eastern China, and parts of sub-Saharan 
Africa. Some of these regions may be marginal for arable farm-
ing because of marshy soils or other adverse conditions, while 
▲ Figure 8.3 Deforestation Forest clearance in Malaysia in preparation for an oil palm plantation.
▲ Figure 8.4 Agricultural land cover Some countries, like the United States, are fortunate in having a broad range of  
cultivable land, which allows for many options in agricultural development. Many countries, though, have a much narrower 
base of cultivable land and must rely on the exploitation of one major resource as a means to economic development.

HUMAN GEOGRAPHY   Places and Regions in Global Context
irrigation or other factors sometimes  extends the local frontier 
of productive agriculture. We also have to bear in mind that not 
all cultivable land is of the same quality. This leads to the con-
cept of the carrying capacity of  agricultural land: the maximum 
population that can be maintained in a place under current tech-
nologies and best practices, without damaging the overall pro-
ductivity of that or other places.
Industrial Resources A high proportion of the world's key 
industrial resources—basic raw materials—are concentrated 
in Russia, the United States, Canada, South Africa, and Aus-
tralia. The United States, for example, in addition to having 
42 percent of the world's known resources of hydrocarbons 
(oil, natural gas, and oil shales) and 38 percent of the lignite 
("brown coal," used mainly in power stations), has 38 per-
cent of the molybdenum (used in metal alloys), 21 percent 
of the lead (used for batteries, gasoline, and construction),  
19 percent of the copper (used for electrical wiring and compo-
nents and for coinage), 18 percent of the bituminous coal (used 
for fuel in power stations and in the chemical industry), and 
15 percent of the zinc. Russia has 68 percent of the vanadium 
(used in metal alloys), 50 percent of the lignite, 38 percent of 
the bituminous coal, 35 percent of the manganese, 25 percent 
of the iron, and 19 percent of the hydrocarbons (Figure 8.5).
Resources and Development
The concentration of known resources in just a few countries 
is largely a result of geology, but it is also partly a function of 
countries' political and economic development. Political insta-
bility in much of postcolonial Africa, Asia, and Latin America 
has seriously hindered their exploration and exploitation of 
resources. In contrast, the relative affluence and great politi-
cal stability of the United States have led to a much more in-
tensive exploration of resources. We should also bear in mind 
that the significance of particular resources is often tied to par-
ticular technologies. As technologies change, so do resource 
requirements, and the geography of economic development is 
"rewritten." One important example of this was the switch in 
the manufacture of mass-produced textiles from natural fibers 
like wool and cotton to synthetic fibers in the 1950s and 1960s. 
When this happened, many farmers in the U.S. South had to 
switch from cotton to other crops.
Regions and countries that are heavily dependent on 
one particular resource are vulnerable to the consequences 
of technological change. They are also vulnerable to fluctua-
tions in the price set for their product on the world market. 
These vulnerabilities are particularly important for countries 
whose economies are dependent on nonfuel minerals, such 
as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (copper), Mauritania 
(iron ore), Namibia (diamonds), Niger (uranium), Sierra Leone 
 (diamonds), Togo (phosphates), and Zambia (copper).
Resources and Sustainability The ideal of sustainable 
development is one that achieves a balance among economic 
growth, the environmental impacts of that growth, and the fair-
ness, or social equity, of the distribution of the costs and bene-
fits of that growth. The importance of sustainability is cogently 
illustrated by the concept of an ecological footprint, which is 
a measure of the human pressures on the natural environment 
from the consumption of renewable resources and the produc-
tion of pollution. It represents a quantitative assessment of the 
biologically productive area required to produce the resources 
(food, energy, and materials) and to absorb the wastes of an in-
dividual, city, region, or country. The ecological footprint of 
a country or region changes in proportion to population size, 
average consumption per person, and the resource intensity of 
the technology being used.
Humanity's footprint first grew larger than global biocapacity 
in the 1980s, and this overshoot has been increasing every year 
since. In 2006, demand exceeded supply by about 40 percent. This 
means that it took almost a year and five months for Earth to pro-
duce the ecological resources we used in that year. At 9.0 hectares 
(23.6 acres) per person, the United States currently has the sixth-
largest per capita ecological footprint on the planet, just behind 
the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, Denmark, and Belgium. 
Other countries with extremely large ecological footprints include 
Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, Finland, and Sweden. Coun-
tries with the smallest ecological footprints, between 0.5 
and 0.75 hectares (1.2 to 1.9 acres) per person, include Af-
ghanistan, Bangladesh, Haiti, and Malawi.
Sustainable development means using renewable 
natural resources in a manner that does not eliminate 
or degrade them—by making greater use, for example, 
of solar and  geothermal energy and recycled materials. 
It means managing economic systems so that all re-
sources—physical and  human—are used optimally. It 
means regulating economic systems so that the benefits 
of development are  distributed more equitably (if only 
to prevent poverty from causing  environmental degra-
dation). It also means organizing societies so that im-
proved education, health care, and social welfare can 
contribute to environmental awareness and  sensitivity 
and an improved quality of life. A final and more 
 radical  aspect of sustainable development involves 
moving away from wholesale globalization toward in-
creased "localization": a return to more  locally based  
▼ Figure 8.5 Resource extraction Mining potassium salt (to be used as a fertilizer) 
near Perm, Russia.

CHAPTER 8   Geographies of Economic Development   293
economies where production,  consumption, and  decision mak-
ing are oriented to local needs and  conditions (Figure 8.6).
Defined this way, sustainable development sounds emi-
nently sensible yet impossibly utopian. A succession of interna-
tional summit meetings on the topic has revealed deep conflicts 
of interest between core countries and peripheral countries. 
One of the most serious obstacles to prospects for sustainable 
development is continued heavy reliance on fossil fuels as the 
fundamental source of energy for  economic  development. This 
not only perpetuates international  inequalities but also leads to 
transnational problems such as acid rain, global warming, cli-
matic changes, deforestation, health  hazards, and, many would 
argue, war. The sustainable alternative—renewable energy 
 generated from the sun, tides, waves, winds, rivers, and geother-
mal features—has been pursued half-heartedly because of the 
commercial interests of the powerful corporations and govern-
ments that control fossil-fuel resources.
A second important challenge to the possibility of  sustainable 
development is the rate of demographic growth in peripheral 
countries. Sustainable development is feasible only if population 
size and growth are in harmony with the changing productive 
capacity of the ecosystem. It is estimated that 1.2 billion of the 
world's 6.9 billion people are undernourished and underweight.
But the greatest single obstacle to sustainable development 
is the inadequacy of institutional frameworks. Sustainable de-
velopment requires economic, financial, and fiscal decisions to 
be fully integrated with environmental and ecological decisions. 
National and local governments everywhere have evolved insti-
tutional structures that tend to separate decisions about what is 
economically rational and what is environmentally desirable. In-
ternational organizations, while better placed to integrate policy 
across these sectors and better able to address economic and en-
vironmental "spillovers" from one country to another, have (with 
the notable exception of the European Union) not acquired suffi-
cient power to promote integrated, harmonized policies. Without 
radical and widespread changes in value systems and unprec-
edented changes in political will, "sustainable development" is 
likely to remain an embarrassing contradiction in terms.

THE ECONOMIC STRUCTURE OF 
COUNTRIES AND REGIONS
The economic structure of a country or region can be described 
in terms of its relative share of primary, secondary, tertiary, and 
quaternary economic activities (see Table 8.1).
Variations in economic structure—according to primary, 
secondary, tertiary, or quaternary activities—reflect geographical  
divisions of labor. Geographical divisions of labor are national,

HUMAN GEOGRAPHY   Places and Regions in Global Context
regional, and locally based economic specializations that have 
evolved with the growth of the world-system of trade and poli-
tics and with the locational needs of successive technology sys-
tems. They represent one of the most important dimensions of 
economic development. For instance, countries whose econo-
mies are dominated by primary-sector activities tend to have a 
relatively low per capita GDP. The exceptions are  oil-rich coun-
tries such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Venezuela. Where the 
 international division of labor (the specialization, by countries, 
in particular products for export) has produced national econ-
omies with a large secondary sector, per capita GDP is much 
higher (as, for example, in Argentina and South Korea). The 
highest levels of per capita GDP, however, are associated with 
economies that are postindustrial: economies where the tertiary 
and quaternary sectors have grown to dominate the workforce, 
with smaller but highly productive secondary sectors.
As Figure 8.7 shows, the economic structure of much of the 
world is dominated by the primary sector. In much of  Africa 
and Asia, between 50 and 75 percent of the labor force is 
 engaged in primary-sector activities such as agriculture, min-
ing, fishing, and forestry. In contrast, the primary sector of the 
world's core regions is typically small, occupying only 5 to 10 
percent of the labor force.
The secondary sector is much larger in the core countries 
and in semiperipheral countries, where the world's specialized 
manufacturing regions are located. In 2012, core countries ac-
counted for almost three-quarters of world manufacturing value 
added (MVA). MVA is the net output of secondary industries; it is 
determined by adding up the value of all outputs and subtracting 
the value of all intermediate inputs. This share has been slowly 
decreasing, however. The core countries had an average annual 
growth rate for MVA of around 2 percent during 1990-2012, while 
the growth rate in the rest of the world was closer to 7 percent.
This growth has been concentrated in semiperipheral, 
newly industrializing countries (NICs). Newly industrializing 
countries are countries, formerly peripheral within the world-
system, that have acquired a significant industrial sector, 
usually through foreign direct investment. Of the 20 biggest 
manufacturing countries in 2012, 7 were NICs: China, South 
Korea, Mexico, Brazil, India, Indonesia, and Thailand (listed 
here in order of importance).
In terms of individual countries, the United States remains 
the most important source of manufactured goods, account-
ing for just over 22 per cent of global MVA in 2012. Just five 
 countries—the United States, Japan, Germany, China, and the 
United Kingdom—together produced over 60 percent of the 
world total MVA. The highly capitalized manufacturing indus-
tries of the developed countries have been able to maintain high 
levels of worker productivity, with the result that the contribu-
tion of manufacturing to their GDP has remained relatively high 
even as the size of their manufacturing labor force has decreased.
Although the United States has retained its leadership as 
the world's major producer of manufactured goods, its domi-
nance has been significantly reduced. China, in particular, 
has experienced a dramatic increase in manufacturing pro-
duction, achieving annual average growth rates during the

1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s of about 8 percent, 11 per-
cent, 14 percent, and 9 percent, respectively (see Box 8.2, 
"Window on the World: China's Economic Development").  
South Korea has also enjoyed a spectacular increase in man-
ufacturing production (Figure 8.8), achieving annual average 
growth rates of almost 18 percent in the 1960s, 17 percent in 
the 1970s, 12 percent in the 1980s, more than 7 percent in the 
1990s, and around 6 percent in the 2000s. More recently, other 
Pacific Rim NICs, such as Malaysia and Thailand, have experi-
enced rapid growth in manufacturing production.
These shifts are part of a globalization of economic activity 
that has emerged as the overarching component of the world's 
economic geography. As we shall see, it has been corporate strat-
egy, particularly the strategies of large transnational corpora-
tions (TNCs), which has created this globalization of economic 
activity. Transnational corporations are companies that partici-
pate not only in international trade but also in production, man-
ufacturing, and/or sales operations in several countries.
The tertiary and quaternary sectors are significant only in 
the most affluent countries of the core. Globalization has meant 
that knowledge-based activities have become a critical aspect 
of economic development, resulting in the rapid growth of qua-
ternary industries.
Knowledge and Economics
For the world's core economies, knowledge has become more im-
portant than physical and human resources in determining levels 
of economic well-being. More than half of the GDP of major core 
countries is based on the production and distribution of knowl-
edge. In the United States, more workers are engaged in produc-
ing and distributing knowledge than in making physical goods.
For the world's peripheral economies, lack of  knowledge—
along with a limited capacity to absorb and communicate 
knowledge—is an increasingly important barrier to economic 
development. Poor countries have fewer resources to devote 
to research, development, and the acquisition of information 
technology. They also have fewer institutions for pro-
viding high-quality education, fewer bodies that can 
enforce standards and performance, and only weakly 
developed organizations for gathering and disseminating 
the  information needed for business transactions. As a 
result, economic productivity tends to fall relative to the 
performance of places and regions in core economies, 
where new knowledge is constantly generated and rap-
idly and effectively disseminated. All these problems are 
compounded by gender inequalities (see Box 8.3: "Spa-
tial Inequality: Gender and Economic Development").
APPLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE
1.  Why do you think certain places in the world specialize in 
one sector over others?
2.  Consider a product that you own, such as a T-shirt, a pair 
of shoes, or your smartphone and map out the product's 
development through the primary, secondary, and ter-
tiary activities. Think about the entire process of your 
product's development: Who designed the product? 
From which country are the raw materials sourced? Who 
creates that actual object, that is, who comprises the la-
bor force that sews, builds or assembles your object?
International Trade
The geographical division of labor on a world scale means that 
the geography of international trade is very complex. One sig-
nificant reflection of the increased economic integration of the 
world-system is that global trade has grown much more rapidly 
over the past few decades than global production. Between 
1990 and 2012, the average annual growth rate of the value of 
world exports was twice that of the growth of world produc-
tion and several times greater than that of world population 
growth.
The fundamental structure of international trade is based 
on a few trading blocs—groups of countries with formalized 
systems of trading agreements. Most of the world's trade takes 
place within four trading blocs:
■ Western Europe, together with some former European 
 colonies in Africa, South Asia, the Caribbean, and 
Australasia;
■ North America, together with some Latin American states;
■ the countries of the former Soviet Union; and
■ Japan, together with other East Asian states and the oil- 
exporting states of Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.
Nevertheless, a significant number of countries exhibit a 
high degree of autarky from the world economy. That is, they 
do not contribute significantly to the flows of imports and ex-
ports that constitute the geography of trade. Typically, these are 
smaller, peripheral countries, such as Bolivia, Burkina Faso, 
Ghana, Malawi, Samoa, and Tanzania.

HUMAN GEOGRAPHY   Places and Regions in Global Context
8.2 Window on the World
China's Economic Development
Under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping (1978-1997), China embarked on a 
thorough reorientation of its economy, dismantling Communist-style central 
planning in favor of private entrepreneurship and market mechanisms and in-
tegrating itself into the world economy. Saying that he did not care whether 
the cat was black or white as long as it caught mice, Deng established a pro-
gram of "Four Modernizations" (industry, agriculture, science, and defense) and 
an "open-door policy" that allowed China to be plugged in to the interdepen-
dent circuits of the global economy. As a result, China has completely reorga-
nized and revitalized its economy. Agriculture has been decollectivized, with 
Communist collective farms modified to allow a degree of private profit-taking. 
State-owned industries have been closed or privatized, and centralized state 
planning has been dismantled in order to foster private entrepreneurship.
In the 1980s and early 1990s, when the world economy was sluggish, 
China's manufacturing sector grew by almost 15 percent each year. For ex-
ample, almost all of the shoes once made in South Korea or Taiwan are now 
made in China. More than 60 percent of the toys in the world, accounting 
for more than $10 billion in trade, are also made in China. Since 1992, China 
has extended its open-door policy, permitted foreign investment aimed at 
Chinese domestic markets, and normalized trading relationships with the 
United States and the European Union. In 2001, China was admitted to the 
World Trade Organization, allowing the country to trade more freely than 
ever before with the rest of the world.
China's increased participation in world trade has created an entirely 
new situation within the world economy. Chinese manufacturers, operat-
ing with low wages, have imposed a deflationary trend on world prices for 
manufacturers. The Chinese economy's size makes it a major producer, and 
its labor costs stay flat year after year because there is an endless supply of 
people who will work for 60 cents an hour. Meanwhile, the rapid expansion 
of consumer demand in China has begun to drive up commodity prices in 
the world market. Overall, China's economy is already the third largest in the 
world after those of the United States and Japan.
Nowhere have China's "open-door" policies had more impact than in South 
China, where the Chinese government has deliberately built upon the prosper-
ity of Hong Kong, the former British colony that was returned to China in 1997. 
The coastline of South China provides many protected bays suitable for har-
bors and a series of ports, including Quanzhou, Shantou, Xiamen, and, on either 
side of the mouth of the Zhu Jiang (Pearl River), Macão and Hong Kong. These 
ports made possible South China's emergence as a core manufacturing region 
by providing an interface with the world economy. The established trade and 
manufacturing of Macão—a Portuguese colony that was returned to China in 
1999—and Hong Kong provided another precondition for success.
When Deng established his "open-door" policy, a third factor kicked in: 
capital investment from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the Chinese diaspora. By 
1993, more than 15,000 manufacturers from Hong Kong alone had set up 
businesses in neighboring Guangdong Province, and a similar number es-
tablished subcontracting relationships, contracting out processing work to 
Chinese companies. Today, the cities and special economic zones of South 
China's "Gold Coast" provide a thriving export-processing platform that has 
driven double-digit annual economic growth for much of the past two de-
cades. The population of Shenzhen (Figure 8.A) has grown from just 19,000 
▲ Figure 8.A Shenzhen The city of Shenzhen, just across the border from the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong.

CHAPTER 8   Geographies of Economic Development   297
in 1975 to 15 million in 2012. Such growth has generated a substantial 
middle class with significant spending power (Figure 8.B); it has also created  
significant inflation, especially in real estate values (Figure 8.C).
Much of China's manufacturing growth has been based on a strategy of 
import substitution (see page 300). In spite of China's membership in the 
World Trade Organization (which has strict rules about intellectual prop-
erty), a significant amount of China's industry is based on counterfeiting 
and reverse engineering (making products that are copied and then sold 
under different or altered brand names) and piracy (making look-alike prod-
ucts passed off as the real thing). Copies of everything from DVDs, mov-
ies, designer clothes and footwear, drugs, motorcycles, and automobiles to 
high-speed magnetic levitation (maglev) cross-country trains save Chinese 
industry enormous sums in research and develop-
ment and licensing fees, while saving the country even 
greater sums in imports.
Foreign investors, meanwhile, have been keen to 
develop a share of China's rapidly expanding and 
increasingly affluent market. The automobile market 
is particularly attractive to Western manufacturers. 
Volkswagen was the first to establish a presence in 
China, in 1985. By 2003, Volkswagen had claimed 
around 40 percent of China's annual production of 
almost 4 million cars and light trucks. General Motors, 
in partnership with Shanghai Automotive Industry 
Corporation, has a 10 percent market share. Other 
foreign manufacturers operating in China include 
Honda, Toyota, Nissan, and, most recently, BMW and 
Mercedes-Benz.
Overall, most foreign investment in China comes 
from elsewhere within East Asia. Japan, Taiwan, and 
South Korea, having developed manufacturing indus-
tries that undercut those of the United States, now 
face deindustrialization themselves through the inexo-
rable process of "creative destruction" (see page 306). 
More than 10,000 Taiwanese firms have established 
operations in China, investing an estimated $150 bil-
lion. Pusan, the center of the South Korean footwear 
industry that in 1990 exported $4.3 billion worth of

wear exports are down to less than $700 million, while 
China's footwear exports have increased from $2.1 
billion in 1990 to $44 billion in 2012. Several Japa-
nese electronics giants, including Toshiba Corp., Sony 
Corp., Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., and Canon, 
Inc., have expanded operations in China even as they 
have shed tens of thousands of workers at home. 
Olympus manufactures its digital cameras in Shenzhen 
and Guangzhou. Pioneer has moved its manufacture 
of DVD recorders to Shanghai and Dongguan.
Toshiba's factory in Dalian illustrates the logic. 
Toshiba is one of about 40 Japanese companies 
that built large-scale production facilities in a spe-
cial export-processing zone established by Dalian 
in the early 1990s with generous financial support 
from the Japanese government and major Japanese 
firms. By shifting production of digital televisions from its plant in Saitama, 
Japan, in 2001, Toshiba cut labor costs per worker by 90 percent.

As we saw in Chapter 2, there are wide international 
 disparities in education, health, and economic opportunity 
in terms of gender. Gender equality matters intrinsically, 
because the ability to live the life of one's own choosing 
is a basic  human right and should be equal for everyone, 
 regardless of  gender. But gender equality also matters 
 because greater gender equality contributes to economic 
development  (Figure 8.D). The World Bank's World 
 Development Report for 2012 covered this topic in detail. 
The report concludes that gender equality can enhance economic ef-
ficiency and improve other development outcomes in three ways:
■  Removing barriers that prevent women from having the same access as 
men to education, economic opportunities, and productive inputs can 
generate broad gains in productivity.
■ Improving women's absolute and relative status feeds many other  
development outcomes, including those for their children.
■ When women and men have equal chances to become socially and 
politically active, make decisions, and shape policies, this leads over 
time to more representative and more inclusive institutions and policy 
choices and thus to a better development path.
8.3 Spatial Inequality 
Gender and Economic Development
Eliminating barriers that prevent women from working in certain 
 occupations or sectors would reduce the productivity gap between 
male and female workers by one-third to one-half and increase output 
per worker by 3 to 25 percent across a range of countries. Increasing the 
share of household income controlled by women, either through their 
own earnings or cash transfers, changes spending in ways that benefit chil-
dren in terms of both life expectancy and educational attainment. Wom-
en's collective agency can be transformative for society. It can shape the 
institutions, markets, and social norms that limit their individual agency 
and opportunities. Empowering women as political and social  actors can 
change policy choices and make institutions more representative of a 
range of voices.

CHAPTER 8   Geographies of Economic Development   299
Shifts in global politics have affected the geography of 
trade. One important change was the breakup of the former 
Soviet Union. Other significant geopolitical shifts include the 
trend toward the political as well as economic  integration of 
Europe and the increasing participation of China in the world 
economy. But perhaps the most important shift in global 
 politics in relation to world trade has been the shift  toward 
open markets and free trade through neoliberal policies 
 propagated by core countries (Figure 8.9). Neoliberal  policies 
are  economic policies predicated on a minimalist role for the 
state that assume the desirability of free markets not only for 
economic organization but also for political and social life. 
If necessary, social goals and regulatory standards have to be 
sacrificed, it is argued, to ensure that business has the maxi-
mum latitude for profitability. The rising tide of economic de-
velopment, the argument goes, will then trickle down to less 
prosperous areas. Neoliberalism has meant the deregulation of 
finance and industry; the shedding of many of the traditional 
roles of central and local governments as mediators and regu-
lators; curbs on the power and influence of labor unions and 
government agencies; a reduction of public investment in the 
physical infrastructure of roads, bridges and public utilities; 
the creation of free trade zones, enterprise zones, and other 
deregulated spaces; and the privatization of government ser-
vices. The overall effect has been to "hollow out" the capacity 
of central governments to shape economic development while 
forcing local and regional governments to become increasingly 
entrepreneurial in pursuit of jobs and revenues.
The opening of markets and the globalization of economic 
activity has created new flows of materials, components, in-
formation, and finished products. As a global system of manu-
facturing has emerged, significant quantities of manufactured 
goods are now imported and exported across much of the 
world through complex commodity chains (as we saw in the 
case of blue jeans in Box 2.2. "Visualizing Geography: Com-
modity Chains"); no longer do developed economies export 
manufactured goods and peripheral countries import them. Af-
rican countries are an important exception, with many of them 
barely participating in world trade in manufactured goods.
One important aspect of world trade is that the smaller, 
 peripheral partners in trading relationships are highly dependent 
on developed economies. An aspect of dependency, in this con-
text, is the degree to which a country's export base lacks diversity. 
Dependency involves a high level of reliance by a country on for-
eign enterprises, investment, or technology. External dependence 
for a country means that it is highly reliant on levels of demand 
and the overall economic climate of other countries. Dependency 
for a peripheral country can result in a narrow economic base in 
which the balancing of national accounts and the generation of 
foreign exchange depend on the export of one or two agricultural 
or mineral resources, as is the case in Angola, Chad, the Domini-
can Republic, Iran, Iraq, Libya, and Nigeria, for example.
Patterns of International Debt In many peripheral coun-
tries, debt service—the annual interest on international debts—
is a significant handicap to economic development. For every 
$1 that developing countries receive in aid, they end up hav-
ing to return $5 in debt service payments to core countries. In 
some countries, 20 percent or more of all export earnings are 
swallowed up by debt service (Figure 8.10).
At the root of the international debt problem is the 
structured inequality of the world economy. The role 
 inherited by most peripheral countries within the inter-
national division of labor has been one of producing pri-
mary goods and commodities for which both the elasticity 
of demand and price elasticity are low. The  elasticity of 
 demand is the degree to which levels of demand for a prod-
uct or service change in response to changes in price.

East Asia, in Manila, the Philippines.

Where a relatively small change in price induces a significant 
change in demand, elasticity is high; where levels of demand 
remain fairly stable in spite of price changes, demand is said to 
be inelastic. Demand for the products of peripheral countries 
in their principal markets (the more developed countries) has a 
low elasticity: It tends to increase by relatively small amounts 
in response to significant increases in the incomes of their cus-
tomers. Similarly, significant reductions in the price of their 
products tend to result in only a relatively small increase in 
demand.
Consider, for example, the cocoa-producing regions of West 
Africa (Figure 8.11). No matter how they improve productivity in 
order to keep prices low, and no matter how much more affluent 
their customers in core countries become, there is a limit to the 
demand for cocoa products. In contrast, the elasticity of demand 
and price elasticity of high-tech manufactured goods and high-
order services (the specialties of core economies within the in-
ternational division of labor) are both high. As a result, the terms 
of trade are stacked against the producers of primary goods.
The terms of trade are determined by the ratio of the 
prices at which exports and imports are ex-
changed. When the price of exports rises 
relative to the price of imports, the terms of 
trade reflect an improvement for the export-
ing country. No matter how efficient primary 
producers may become, or how affluent their  
customers, the balance of trade is tilted against 
them. Quite simply, they must run in order to 
stand still.
An obvious counterstrategy for peripheral 
countries is to attempt to establish a new role in 
the international division of labor, moving away 
from a specialization in primary commodities 
toward a more diversified manufacturing base. 
This strategy is known as import substitution. 
It is a difficult strategy to pursue, however, be-
cause building up a diversified manufacturing 
base requires vast amounts of start-up capital. 
With the terms of trade running against them, it is

▲ Figure 8.10 The debt crisis in 2012 In some countries, the annual interest on international debts (their "debt service") 
accounts for more than 20 percent of the annual value of their exports of goods and services. Many countries first got into 
debt trouble in the mid-1970s, when Western banks, faced with recession at home, offered low-interest loans to the govern-
ments of peripheral countries rather than being stuck with idle capital. When the world economy heated up again, interest 
rates rose and many countries found themselves facing a debt crisis.

extremely difficult for peripheral countries to accumulate 
this capital; so they have to borrow.
The debt problem has led to calls for affluent lend-
ing countries to provide debt relief to some of the poorest 
countries. In 2005, the world's richest countries—the G8 
group—agreed to write off $40 billion in debts owed by 18 
of the world's poorest countries, most of them in Africa. 
Addressing the full magnitude of LDC debt, however, will 
require continued substantial and sustained efforts if the 
poorest countries are to break free of the crushing finan-
cial obligations of their accumulated debts.

Fair Trade The Fair Trade movement is a result of increasing 
awareness within developed countries of the weak bargaining 
position of many small producers at the beginning of the com-
modity chains that underpin the global economy. Fair Trade 
has become part of the "mobilization against globalization," an 
attempt to raise consumers' consciousness about the relation-
ships embodied in their purchases.
The Fair Trade movement is a global network of producers, 
traders, marketers, advocates, and consumers focused on build-
ing equitable trading relationships between consumers and the 
world's most economically disadvantaged artisans and farmers. 
As such, it is fundamentally a strategy for poverty alleviation and 
sustainable development. The key principles of Fair Trade include 
(1) creating opportunities for economically disadvantaged produc-
ers, (2) capacity building, (3) ensuring that women's work is prop-
erly valued and rewarded, (4) ensuring a safe and healthy working 
environment for producers, and (5) payment of a fair price—one 
that covers not only the costs of production but enables produc-
tion that is socially just and environmentally sound. The result is 
often very modest in relation to the retail price of Fair Trade goods 
in developed countries—only about 9 cents of the $3.10 cost of 
an average fairly traded 100-gram bar of chocolate goes to produc-
ers in developing countries, the rest being accounted for by core-
country food processors, designers, packagers, photographers, 
marketing staff, advertisers, shopkeepers, and tax authorities. Nev-
ertheless, Fair Trade demonstrably helps producers in developing 
countries (Figure 8.12) and typically involves democratic decision 
making over how the extra money earned is to be distributed.
Several types of Fair Trade organizations perform various 
roles along the commodity chains linking producers to consumers. 
At the beginning of the commodity chain are producer organiza-
tions—village or community groups or cooperatives, for example, 
often joined together under export marketing organizations. In 
2014, there were more than 1,150 Fair Trade-certified producer 
groups (including many umbrella bodies) worldwide. These or-
ganizations typically sell their products to a second kind of Fair 
Trade organization: registered importers and wholesalers in more 
developed countries. In 2014, these existed in about 60 countries. 
They in turn sell to Fair Trade retailers: "world shops" and cata-
log- or Internet-based retailers (Figure 8.12). In some countries, 
Fair Trade products are now mainstream, available in major su-
permarkets and independent shops and beginning to gain market 
share. In Switzerland, for example, Fair Trade bananas account 
for 20 percent of the retail market. In the United States, it is coffee 
that is the most important Fair Trade-certified product, account-
ing for up to $600 million in sales in 2009.
There are also Fair Trade organizations that are focused 
on labor practices, such as the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI), 
which evolved from Fair Trade campaigns run by British aid 
organizations. ETI involves a multiagency grouping of com-
panies, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and trades 
unions that have together devised a basic code of labor prac-
tices covering the right to collective bargaining, safe and hy-
gienic working conditions, living wages, and a standard 
working week of no more than 48 hours.
Interpretations of International Patterns 
of Development
The overall relationship between economic structure and 
levels of prosperity makes it tempting to interpret economic 
development in distinctive stages. Each developed region or 
country, in other words, might be thought of as progressing 
from the early stages of development, with a heavy reliance 
on primary activities (and relatively low levels of prosper-
ity), through a phase of industrialization and on to a "ma-
ture" stage of postindustrial development (with a diversified 
economic structure and relatively high levels of prosperity).

HUMAN GEOGRAPHY   Places and Regions in Global Context
This, in fact, has been a commonly held view of economic de-
velopment, first conceptualized by a prominent economist,  
W. W. Rostow (Figure 8.13).
Rostow's model, however, is too simplistic to be of much 
help in understanding human geography. The reality is that 
places and regions are now interdependent. The fortunes of any 
given place are increasingly tied up with those of many others. 
Furthermore, Rostow's model perpetuates the myth of "develop-
mentalism," the idea that every country and region will eventu-
ally make economic progress toward "high mass consumption" 
provided that they compete to the best of their ability within the 
world economy. The main weakness of developmentalism is 
that it is simply not reasonable to compare the prospects of late 
starters to the experience of those places, regions, and countries 
that were among the early starters. For these early starters the 
horizons were clear: free of effective competition, free of obsta-
cles, and free of precedents. For the late starters the situation is 
entirely different. Today's less developed regions must compete 
in a crowded field while facing numerous barriers that are a di-
rect consequence of the success of some of the early starters.
Indeed, many writers and theorists of international de-
velopment claim that the prosperity of the core countries in 
the world economy has been based on underdevelopment 
and squalor in peripheral countries. Peripheral countries, it 
is  argued, could not "follow" the previous historical experi-
ence of developed countries in stages-of-development fashion 
because their underdevelopment (that is, exploitation) was a 
structural requirement for development elsewhere. The devel-
opment of Europe and North America, in other words, required 
the systematic underdevelopment of peripheral countries.  
By means of unequal trade, exploitation of labor, and profit 
extraction, the underdeveloped countries became increasingly 
rather than decreasingly impoverished.

▲ Figure 8.13 Stages of economic development This diagram illustrates a model based on the idea of successive stages of economic development. Each 
stage is seen as leading to the next, though some regions or countries may take longer than others to make the transition from one stage to the next. According 
to this view, now regarded as overly simplistic, places and regions follow parallel courses within a world that is steadily modernizing. Late starters eventually make 
progress, but at speeds determined by their resource endowments, their productivity, and the wisdom of their people's policies and decisions.

CHAPTER 8   Geographies of Economic Development   303
This explanation is known as "dependency theory." It has 
been a very influential approach in explaining global patterns 
of development and underdevelopment. Dependency theory 
states, essentially, that development and underdevelopment 
are reverse sides of the same process: Development somewhere 
requires underdevelopment elsewhere. Immanuel Wallerstein's 
world-system theory (see Chapter 2) takes this kind of depen-
dency into account. According to this perspective, the entire 
world economy is to be seen as an evolving market system with 
an economic hierarchy of states—a core, a semiperiphery, and 
a periphery. The composition of this hierarchy is variable: In-
dividual countries can move from periphery to semiperiphery, 
core to periphery, and so on.
REGIONAL ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENT
Unevenness in economic development often has a regional 
dimension. Initial conditions are a crucial determinant of re-
gional economic performance. Scarce resources, a history of 
neglect, lack of investment, and concentrations of low-skilled 
people all combine to explain the lagging performance of cer-
tain areas. In some regions, initial extreme disadvantages con-
strain the opportunities of individuals born there. A child born 
in the Mexican state of Chiapas, for example, has much bleaker 
prospects than a child born in Mexico City. The child from 
Chiapas is twice as likely to die before age 5, less than half as 
likely to complete primary school, and 10 times as likely to 
live in a house without access to running water. On reaching 
working age, he or she will earn 20 to 35 percent less than a 
comparable worker living in Mexico City and 40 to 45 percent 
less than one living in northern Mexico.
Other examples of regional inequality can be found 
throughout the world, and globalization has increased regional 
inequality within many countries. In China, for example, dis-
parities have widened dramatically between the interior and 
the export-oriented regions of the coast. The transition econo-
mies of the countries of the former Soviet Union and its East-
ern European satellites have registered some of the largest 
increases in regional inequality; some core countries—espe-
cially Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States—
have also registered significant increases in regional inequality 
since the 1980s. At this regional scale, as at the global scale, 
levels of economic development often exhibit a fundamental 
core-periphery structure. Indeed, within-country core-periph-
ery contrasts are evident throughout the world: in core coun-
tries such as France and the United States, in semiperipheral 
countries such as South Korea, and in peripheral countries 
such as Nigeria and Indonesia.
The Economics of Location
Patterns of regional economic development are historical in 
origin and cumulative in nature. Recognizing this, geographers 
are interested in geographical path dependence, the relation-
ship between present-day activities in a place and the past 
experiences of that place. An important principle of regional 
economic development is the principle of initial advantage. 
Initial advantage highlights the importance of an early start in 
economic development. It represents a special case of external 
economies. Other things being equal, new phases of economic 
development take hold first in settings that offer external econ-
omies: existing labor markets, existing consumer markets, ex-
isting frameworks of fixed social capital, and so on. External 
economies are cost savings that result from advantages beyond 
a firm's organization and methods of production. These initial 
advantages are consolidated by localization economies—cost 
savings that accrue to particular industries as a result of clus-
tering together at a specific location—and so form the basis for 
continuing economic growth.
Examples of localization economies include sharing a pool 
of labor with special skills or experience, supporting specialized 
technical schools, joining to create a marketing organization or 
a research institute, and drawing on specialized subcontractors, 
maintenance firms, suppliers, distribution agents, and lawyers. If 
such advantages lead to a reputation for high-quality production, 
localization is intensified because more producers want to cash 
in on the reputation. Among many examples are the electronics 
and software industries of Silicon Valley; recording companies 
in Los Angeles; Sheffield steel and steel products, especially 
cutlery, from England; the U.S. auto industry in Detroit; Swiss 
watches made in the towns of Biel, Geneva, and Neuchâtel; Bel-
gian lace from Bruges, Brussels, and Mechelen; English worsted 
in Bradford and Huddersfield; Stoke-on-Trent English china; 
Irish linen from Athlone; and French perfume made in Grasse.
For places and regions with a substantial initial advantage, 
therefore, the trajectory of geographical path dependence tends 
to be one of persistent growth. This pattern reinforces, in turn, 
the core-periphery patterns of economic development found in 
every part of the world and at every spatial scale. That said, ge-
ographers recognize there is no single pathway to development. 
The consequences of initial advantage for both core and periph-
eral regions can be—and often are—modified. Old core-periph-
ery relationships can be blurred, and new ones can be initiated.

there outside sources contributing to the inertia of this clustering?
Regional Economic Linkages
Regional cores of economic development are created cumula-
tively, through the operation of basic principles of economic 
geography within complex webs of functional interdepen-
dence. These webs include the relationships and linkages be-
tween different kinds of industries, different kinds of stores, 
and different kinds of offices. Particularly important here 

304 
HUMAN GEOGRAPHY   Places and Regions in Global Context
are the agglomeration effects associated with various kinds 
of local economic linkages and interdependencies. These in-
clude the cost advantages that accrue to individual firms be-
cause of their location among functionally related activities.  
The trigger for agglomeration effects can be any kind of economic 
development—the establishment of a trading port or the growth 
of a local industry or any large-scale enterprise, for example. 
The external economies and economic linkages generated by 
such developments are the initial advantages that can stimulate 
a self-propelling process of local economic development.
A number of interrelated effects come into play when 
new economic activity begins in an area. Backward linkages 
develop as new firms arrive to provide the growing industry 
with components, supplies, specialized services, or facilities. 
Forward linkages develop as new firms arrive to take the fin-
ished products of the growing industry and use them in their 
own processing, assembly, finishing, packaging, or distribu-
tion operations. Together with the initial growth, the growth in 
these linked industries helps create a threshold of activity large 
enough to attract ancillary industries and activities (e.g., main-
tenance and repair, recycling, security, and business services).
The existence of these interrelated activities establishes a pool 
of specialized labor with the kinds of skills and experience that 
make the area attractive to still more firms. Meanwhile, the link-
ages among all these firms help promote interaction between pro-
fessional and technical personnel and allow the area to support 
R&D (research and development) facilities, research institutes, and 
so on, thus increasing the likelihood of local inventions and inno-
vations that might further stimulate local economic development.
Another aspect of local economic growth results from the 
increase in population represented by the families of employees. 
Their presence creates a demand for housing, utilities, physi-
cal infrastructure, retailing, personal services, and so on—all of 
which generate additional jobs. This expansion, in turn, helps 
create populations large enough to attract an even wider variety 
and more sophisticated kinds of services and amenities. Last—
but by no means least—the overall growth in local employment 
creates a larger local tax base. The local government can then 
provide improved public utilities, roads, schools, health ser-
vices, recreational amenities, and so on—all of which serve to 
intensify agglomeration economies and so enhance the competi-
tiveness of the area in attracting further rounds of investment.
Swedish economist Gunnar Myrdal, the 1974 Nobel Prize 
winner, was the first to recognize that any significant initial local 
advantage tends to be reinforced through these geographic prin-
ciples of agglomeration and localization. He called the process 
cumulative causation (Figure 8.14). Cumulative causation refers 
to the spiraling buildup of advantages that occurs in specific 
geographic settings as a result of the development of external 
economies, agglomeration effects, and localization economies. 
Myrdal also pointed out that this spiral of local growth tends 
to attract people—enterprising young people, usually—and in-
vestment funds from other areas. According to the basic princi-
ples of spatial interaction, these flows tend to be strongest from 
nearby regions and areas with the lowest wages, fewest job op-
portunities, or least attractive investment opportunities.
In some cases this loss of entrepreneurial talent, labor, and 
investment capital is sufficient to trigger a cumulative negative 
spiral of economic disadvantage. With less capital, less innova-
tive energy, and depleted pools of labor, industrial growth in 
peripheral regions tends to be significantly slower and less in-
novative than in regions with an initial advantage. This in turn 
tends to limit the size of the local tax base, making it difficult 
for local governments to furnish a competitive infrastructure 
of roads, schools, and recreational amenities. Myrdal called 
these negative impacts on a region (or regions) of the economic 
growth of some other region backwash effects. Negative impacts 
take the form, for example, of out-migration, outflows of invest-
ment capital, and the shrinkage of local tax bases. Backwash 
effects are important because they help explain why regional 
economic development is so uneven and why core-periphery 
contrasts in economic development are so common.

The Modification of Regional  
Core-Periphery Patterns
Although very important, cumulative causation and backwash 
effects are not the only processes affecting the geography of 
economic development. If they were, the world's economic 
 geography would be even more starkly polarized than it is now. 
There would be little chance for the emergence of new growth 
regions, like Guangdong in Southeast China, and there would 
be little likelihood of stagnation or decline in once-booming 
regions, like northern England.
Myrdal himself recognized that peripheral regions do some-
times emerge as new growth regions and partially explained them 
in what he called spread (or trickle-down) effects. Spread effects 
are the positive impacts on a region (or regions) from the eco-
nomic growth of some other region, usually a core region. Growth 
creates levels of demand for food, consumer products, and other 
manufactured goods that are so high that local producers cannot 
satisfy them. This demand gives investors in peripheral regions 
(or countries) the opportunity to establish a local capacity to meet 
the demand. Entrepreneurs who participate are also able to exploit 
the advantages of cheaper land and labor in peripheral regions. If 
strong enough, spread effects can enable peripheral regions to de-
velop their own spiral of cumulative causation, thus changing the 
interregional geography of economic patterns and flows. The eco-
nomic growth of South Korea, for example, is partly attributable 
to the spread effects of Japanese economic prosperity.
Core-periphery patterns and relationships can also change 
as a result of slowdowns or reversals in the spiral of cumulative 
causation in core regions. The main cause of this effect is the 
development of agglomeration diseconomies. Agglomeration 
diseconomies are the negative economic effects of urbanization 
and the local concentration of industry, including the higher 
prices that must be paid by firms competing for land and labor; 
the costs of delays resulting from traffic congestion and crowded

propelling process of economic growth. As this

glomeration and localization reinforce the initial ad-
vantages of industrial growth. The overall process is

be levied by local governments in order to support services and 
amenities previously considered unnecessary—traffic police, 
city planning, and transit systems, for example.
Deindustrialization and Creative Destruction The 
most fundamental cause of change in the relationship between 
initial advantage and cumulative causation is longer-term 
shifts in technology systems and the competition between 
states within the world-system. The innovations associated 
with successive technology systems generate new industries 
that are not yet tied down by enormous investments in factories 
or allied to existing industrial agglomerations. Combined with 
innovations in transport and communications, this creates 
windows of locational opportunity that can result in new in-
dustrial districts, with new generations of small towns or cities 
growing into dominant metropolitan areas through new rounds 
of cumulative causation.
Equally important as a factor in how core-periphery pat-
terns change are the shifts in the profitability of old, estab-
lished industries in core regions compared to the profitability 
of new industries in fast-growing new industrial districts. As 
soon as the differential is large enough, some disinvestment 
takes place within core regions. This disinvestment can take 
place in several ways. Manufacturers can reduce their wage 

306 
HUMAN GEOGRAPHY   Places and Regions in Global Context
bill by cutting back on production; they can reduce their fixed 
costs by closing down and selling off some of their factory 
space and equipment; or they can reduce their spending on re-
search and development for new products. This disinvestment, 
in turn, leads to deindustrialization in formerly prosperous in-
dustrial core regions.
Deindustrialization involves a relative decline (and in ex-
treme cases an absolute decline) in industrial employment in 
core regions as firms scale back their activities in response to 
lower levels of profitability (Figure 8.15). This is what  happened 
to the Manufacturing Belt (sometimes called the "Rust Belt") of 
the United States in the 1960s and 1970s  (Figure 8.16). It also 
occurred in many of the traditional industrial regions of Eu-
rope during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. In France, Belgium, 
the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, 
manufacturing employment decreased by between one-third 
and one-half from 1960 to 1990. The most pronounced exam-
ple of this deindustrialization has been in the United Kingdom, 
where a sharp decline in manufacturing employment has been 
accompanied by an equally sharp rise in service employment.
Meanwhile, the capital made available from disinvestment 
in these core regions becomes available for investment by en-
trepreneurs in new ventures based on innovative products and 
production technologies. Old industries—and sometimes en-
tire old industrial regions—have to be "dismantled" (or at least 
neglected) in order to help fund the creation of new centers of 
profitability and employment. This process is often referred to 
as creative destruction, something that is inherent to the dy-
namics of capitalism. Creative destruction involves the with-
drawal of investments from activities (and regions) that yield 
low rates of profit in order to reinvest in new activities (and 
new regions). The concept of creative destruction provides a 
powerful image, helping us understand the entrepreneur's 
need to withdraw investments from activities (and regions) 
yielding low rates of profit in order to reinvest in new activities 
(and, often, in new regions). In the United States, for example, 
the deindustrialization of the Manufacturing Belt provided the 
capital and the locational flexibility for firms to invest in the 
Sun Belt of the United States and in semiperipheral countries 
like Mexico and South Korea.
The process does not stop there, however. If the deindus-
trialization of the old core regions is severe enough, the rela-
tive cost of their land, labor, and infrastructure may decline 
to the point where they once again become attractive to in-
vestors. As a result, a seesaw movement of investment capital  
occurs, which over the long term tends to move from developed  
to less developed regions—then back again, once the formerly 
developed region has experienced a sufficient relative decline. 
"Has-been" regions can become redeveloped and revitalized, 
given a new lease on life by the infusion of new capital for new 
industries. This is what happened, for example, to the Pittsburgh 
region in the 1980s, resulting in the creation of a postindustrial

gions of Europe and North America during the 1960s, 
1970s, and 1980s. (Reprinted with permission of Pren-

economy out of a depressed industrial setting. USX, the U.S. 
Steel group of companies, reduced its workforce in the Pitts-
burgh region from more than 20,000 to less than 5,000 between 
1975 and 1995. These losses have been more than made up, 
however, by new jobs generated in high-tech electronics, spe-
cialized engineering, and finance and business services.
Government Intervention In addition to the processes of 
deindustrialization and creative destruction, core-periphery 
patterns can also be modified by government intervention. Na-
tional governments realize that regional planning and policy 
can be an important component of strategies to stabilize and  
reorganize their economies, as well as to maximize their overall 
competitiveness. Without regional planning and policy, the re-
sources of peripheral regions can remain underutilized, while 
core regions can become vulnerable to agglomeration disecono-
mies. For political reasons, too, national governments are often 
willing to help particular regions adjust to changing economic 
circumstances. At the same time, most local governments take 
responsibility for stimulating economic development within 
their jurisdiction, if only in order to increase the local tax base 
in the long term.
The nature and extent of government intervention has  varied 
over time and by country. In some countries,  special government 
agencies have been established to promote  regional economic 
development and reduce core-periphery contrasts. Among the 
best-known examples are the  Japanese MITI  (Ministry of Inter-
national Trade and Industry), the  Italian Cassa del Mezzogiorno 
(Southern Development Agency, replaced in 1987 by several 
smaller agencies), and the U.S.  Economic Development Admin-
istration. Some  governments have sought to help industries in 
 declining regions by  undertaking government investment in 
infrastructure and providing subsidies for private  investment; 
others have sought to devise tax breaks that reduce the cost of 
 labor in peripheral regions. Still others have sought to deal with 
agglomeration diseconomies in core regions through increased 
taxes and restrictions on land use (Figure 8.17).
While each approach has its followers, one of the most wide-
spread governmental approaches to core-periphery patterns in-
volves the exploitation of the principle of cumulative causation 
through the creation of growth poles. Growth poles are places 
of economic activity deliberately organized around one or more 
high-growth industries. Economists have noted, however, that 
not all industries are equal in the extent to which they stimu-
late economic growth and cumulative causation. The ones that 
generate the most pronounced effects are known as "propulsive 
industries," and they have received a great deal of attention from 
geographers and economists who are interested in helping shape 
strategic policies that might promote regional economic develop-
ment. In the 1920s, shipbuilding was a propulsive industry. In 
the 1950s and 1960s, automobile manufacturing was a propul-
sive industry, and today biotechnology and digital technologies 
are propulsive industries. The basic idea is for governments to 
promote regional economic growth by fostering propulsive in-
dustries in favorable locations. These locations are intended 
to become growth poles—places that, given an artificial start, 
 develop a self-sustaining spiral of economic prosperity.

GLOBALIZATION AND ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENT
In the past 30 years, regional core-periphery patterns have been 
increasingly influenced by globalization and the economic in-
terdependence of major world regions. This globalization has 
been caused by four important and interrelated factors: a new 
international division of labor, a new technology system, the 
homogenization of international consumer markets, and the in-
ternationalization of finance.
■ A new international division of labor. A major wave of cor-
porate globalization took place in the 1970s, led by manu-
facturing giants like General Motors and General Electric 
that wanted to reduce labor costs, outflank national labor 
unions, and increase overseas market penetration. This 
new international division of labor has resulted in manu-
facturing production shifting from the world's core regions 
to semiperipheral and peripheral countries as companies 
seek to keep production costs low by exploiting the huge 
differentials in wage rates around the world.  Meanwhile, 
new specializations have emerged within the core  regions 
of the world-system: high-tech manufacturing and 
 producer services such as information services,  insurance, 
and market research that enhance the productivity or 
 efficiency of other firms' activities or that enable them to 
maintain specialized roles. These producer services indus-
tries have themselves become globalized in response to the 
needs of their most important clients, the global manufac-
turing corporations.
■ A new technology system, based on a combination of in-
novations, including solar energy, robotics, microelectron-
ics, biotechnology, and digital telecommunications and 
information systems. This has required the geographical 
reorganization of the core economies. It has also extended 
the global reach of finance and industry and permitted a 
more flexible approach to investment and trade. Especially 
important in this regard have been new and improved 
technologies in transport and communications—the in-
tegration of shipping, railroad, and highway systems 
through containerization (Figure 8.18); the introduction of 
wide-bodied cargo jets; and the development of fiber-optic 
networks, communications satellites, and e-mail and infor-
mation retrieval systems.
■ The homogenization of international consumer markets. 
Among the more affluent populations of the world, a new 
and materialistic international culture has taken root, in 
which people save less, borrow more, defer parenthood, 
and indulge in affordable luxuries that are marketed as 
symbols of style and distinctiveness. This culture is easily 
transmitted through the new telecommunications media, 
and it has been an important basis for transnational cor-
porations' global branding and marketing of "world prod-
ucts" (e.g., German luxury automobiles, Swiss watches, 
British raincoats, French wines, American soft drinks, 
Italian shoes and designer clothes, and Japanese consumer 
electronics).
■ The internationalization of finance. The pivotal moment 
in the emergence of global banking and globally inte-
grated financial markets was a "system shock" to the in-
ternational economy that occurred in the mid-1970s. 
World financial markets, swollen with U.S. dollars by 
the U.S. government's deficit budgeting and by huge cur-
rency reserves held by OPEC (Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries) after it had orchestrated a four-fold 
increase in the price of crude oil, quickly evolved into a 
new and sophisticated system of international finance, 
with new patterns of investment and disinvestment. 
Meanwhile, the capacity of computers and informa-
tion systems to deal very quickly with changing interna-
tional conditions added a speculative component to the 
◀ Figure 8.18 The impact of containerization on 
world trade Containerization revolutionized long- 
distance transport by doing away with the slow, expen-
sive, and unreliable business of loading and unload-
ing ships with manual labor. Before containerization, 
ships spent one day in port for every day at sea; in 
the wake of containerization, they spend a day in port 
for every ten days at sea. By 1965, an international 
standard for containers had been adopted, making 
it possible to transfer goods directly from ship to rail 
to road and allowing for a highly integrated global 
transport infrastructure. The average container ship 
today holds 4,000 20-foot containers, but some are 
able to carry 6,000 or 8,000. Containerization requires 
a heavy investment in both vessels and dockside han-
dling equipment, however. As a result, container traffic 
has quickly become concentrated in a few ports that 
handle high-volume transatlantic and transpacific trade. 
This photograph shows the Harem container port in 
Istanbul, Turkey.

internationalization of finance. International movements 
of money, bonds, securities, and other financial instru-
ments have now become an end in themselves because 
they are a potential source of high profits from specula-
tion and manipulation. The global banking and finan-
cial network handles trillions of dollars every day—90 
percent of which has nothing at all to do with the tradi-
tional world economy of trade in goods and services. 
The nerve centers of the new system are located in just 
a few places—London, Frankfurt, New York, and Tokyo, 
in particular. Satellite communications systems and fiber-
optic networks made it possible for firms to operate key 
financial and business services 24 hours a day around  
the globe (Figure 8.19), handling an enormous volume of 
transactions. Taking advantage of the relaxed controls 
on financial institutions resulting from neoliberal poli-
cies, mortgage lenders in core countries (and especially 
the United States) had been selling their mortgages on 
bond markets and to investment banks in order to fund 
the soaring demand for housing. Few in the fi-
nancial services industries fully understood the 
complexities of the booming mortgage market, and 
the various risk-assessment agencies were seri-
ously at fault in underestimating the risks associ-
ated with these loans. Eventually, when interest 
rates increased, many households began to default 
on their monthly payments and, as the bad loans 
added up, mortgage lenders, in turn, found them-
selves in financial trouble.

2. Choose a semiperipheral or peripheral country and

globalization have affected its economic develop-
ment process. Create two lists reflecting the global 
economy: 1) the corporations that have factories, 
service centers or regional head quarters there; 
and 2) the international products and services that 
are popular in that country.
Global Assembly Lines  
and Supply Chains
The globalization of the world economy represents the most 
recent stage in a long process of internationalization. At the 
heart of this process are private companies that participate not 
only in international trade but also in production, manufac-
turing, and/or sales operations in several countries. Almost 
80 percent of Ford's workforce, for example, is employed 
overseas, and foreign sales account for 55 percent of its total 
revenues. Over 50 percent of IBM's workforce is employed 
overseas, and 61 percent of its revenues are derived from for-
eign sales; 82 percent of the workforce of Philips, the Dutch 
electronics firm, is employed overseas, and 95 percent of its 
revenues are derived from foreign sales. Many of these trans-
national corporations have grown large through mergers and 
acquisitions and their activities span a diverse range of eco-
nomic activities.
Corporations like theses that consist of several divisions 
engaged in quite different activities are known as  conglomerate 
corporations. Altria (formerly known as Philip Morris), for 
example, primarily known for its tobacco products (such as 
Marlboro cigarettes), also controls a large group of assets in 
the beverage industry (including Miller Brewing) and has ex-
tensive interests in real estate, import-export, publishing, and 
foods (including General Foods, Tobler, Terry's, and Suchard 
chocolate). Nestlé, the world's largest packaged-food manufac-
turer, is the largest company in Switzerland but derives less 
than 2 percent of its revenue from its home country. Its major

offices are open. This means that between them the world's three major 
financial centers span the globe with almost 24-hour trading in currencies, 
stocks, and other financial instruments.

U.S. product lines and brand names include beverages (Calis-
toga, Nescafé, Nestea, Perrier, Taster's Choice), chocolate and 
candy (Butterfinger, Crunch, KitKat), culinary products (Bu-
itoni, Carnation, Libby, Maggi), frozen foods (Lean Cuisine), 
pet foods (Purina, Fancy Feast, Friskies, Mighty Dog), and 
drugs and cosmetics (L'Oreal). In addition to its 480 factories 
in 63 countries around the world, Nestlé operates more than 40 
Stouffer hotels.
Transnationals and Globalization Transnational cor-
porations first began to appear in the nineteenth century, 
but until the mid-twentieth century there were only a few. 
Most of these were U.S.- or European-based transnation-
als concerned with obtaining raw materials, such as oil or 
minerals, for their domestic manufacturing operations. Af-
ter World War II, an increasing number of large corporations 
began to invest in overseas production and manufacturing 
operations as a means of establishing a foothold in foreign 
consumer markets. Beginning in the 1970s, the growth of 
transnational conglomerates increased sharply, not only in 
the United States but also in Europe, Japan, and even some 
semiperipheral countries. By 2012, there were more than 
43,000 transnational corporations in the world. Of these, the 
top 147, all closely connected to one another, together domi-
nated heart of the world economy. Many of the largest trans-
national corporations are now more powerful, in economic 
terms, than most sovereign nations. General Motors' econ-
omy is larger than Portugal's; Toyota's is larger than Ireland's; 
and Wal-Mart's annual sales exceed Norway's gross domestic  
product.
The advantages to manufacturers of a global assembly line 
are several:
■ A standardized global product for a global market allows 
them to maximize economies of scale.
■ A global assembly line allows production and assembly 
to take greater advantage of the full range of global 
variations in costs. With a global assembly line, labor-
intensive work can be done where labor is cheap, raw 
materials can be processed near their source of supply, 
final assembly can be done close to major markets, and 
so on.
■ A global assembly line means that a company is no 
longer dependent on a single source of supply for a 
specific component, thus reducing its vulnerability to 
industrial troubles and other disturbances.
■ Global sourcing allows transnational conglomerates 
better access to local markets. For example, Boeing 
has pursued a strategy of buying a significant number 
of aircraft components in China and has therefore suc-
ceeded in opening the Chinese market to its products.
The automobile industry was among the first to de-
velop a global assembly line. In 1976, Ford introduced 
the Fiesta, a vehicle designed to sell in Europe, South 
America, and Asia as well as North America. The Fiesta 
was assembled in several locations from components 
manufactured in an even greater number of locations. It 
became the first of a series of Ford "world cars" that now 
includes the Focus, the Mondeo, and the Contour. The 
components of the Ford Escort are made and assembled in 
15 countries across three continents. Ford's international 
subsidiaries, which used to operate independently of the 
parent company, are now functionally integrated, using su-
percomputers and video teleconferences.
The other automobile companies followed suit and orga-
nized their own global assembly systems based on a common 
underbody platform with the flexibility to adapt the interior, 
trim, body, and ride characteristics to conditions in different 
countries. Honda, for example, has produced three distinct 
versions of the same car from its Accord world car platform—
the bigger, family-oriented Accord for American drivers; the 
smaller, sportier Accord aimed at young Japanese profession-
als; and a shorter and narrower Accord, offering the stiff and 
sporty ride preferred by European drivers.
The global assembly lines are constantly being reorga-
nized as transnational corporations seek to take advantage of 
geographical differences between places and regions and as 
workers and consumers in specific places and regions react to 
the consequences of globalization. Nike, the athletic footwear 
and clothing marketer, provides a good illustration. Nike once 
relied on its own manufacturing facilities in the United States 
and the United Kingdom. Today, however, most of its produc-
tion is subcontracted to suppliers in East, South, and South-
east Asia (Figure 8.20). The geography of this subcontracting 
evolved over time in response to the changing pattern of labor 
costs in Asia. The first Asian production of Nike shoes took 
place in Japan. The company then switched most of its sub-
contracting to South Korea and Taiwan. As labor costs rose 
there, Nike's subcontracting spread across more and more 
peripheral countries—China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Viet-
nam—in search of low labor costs. By 2006, Nike subcontrac-
tors employed more than 800,000 people in more than 680 
▼ Figure 8.20 Subcontracting Nike factory on the outskirts of Ho Chi 
Minh City, Vietnam

CHAPTER 8   Geographies of Economic Development   311
different factories. Nike was the largest foreign employer in 
Vietnam, where its factories accounted for 5 percent of Viet-
nam's total exports. China, Indonesia, and Thailand were also 
major components in Nike's expanded global assembly line 
because of their low wage costs—around $60 per month.
Flexible Production Systems The strategies of transna-
tional corporations are an important element in the transition 
from Fordism to neo-Fordism in much of the world. Fordism 
is named after Henry Ford, the automobile manufacturer who 
pioneered the principles involved: mass production, based 
on assembly-line techniques and "scientific" management, 
together with mass consumption, based on higher wages and 
sophisticated advertising techniques. In neo-Fordism the logic 
of mass production coupled with mass consumption has been 
modified by the addition of more flexible production, distribu-
tion, and marketing systems. This flexibility is rooted in forms 
of production that enable manufacturers to shift quickly and 
efficiently from one level of output to another and, more im-
portantly, from one product configuration to another.
Flexible production systems involve flexibility both within 
firms and between them. Within firms, new technologies now 
allow a great deal of flexibility. Computerized machine tools, 
for example, are capable of producing a variety of new products 
simply by being reprogrammed, often with very little down-
time between production runs for different products. Different 
stages of the production process (sometimes located in differ-
ent places) are integrated and coordinated through computer-
aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) 
systems. Computer-based information systems monitor retail 
sales and track wholesale orders, allowing producers to reduce 
the costs of raw materials stockpiles, parts inventories, and 
warehousing through sophisticated small-batch, just- in-time 
production and distribution systems. Just-in-time production  
employs vertical disintegration (see p. 269) within large, 
formerly functionally integrated firms, such as automobile 
manufacturers, in which daily and even hourly deliveries of 
parts and other supplies from smaller (often nonunion) sub-
contractors and suppliers now arrive "just in time" to main-
tain "last-minute" and "zero" inventories. The combination of 
computer-based information systems, CAD/CAM systems, and 
computerized machine tools has also given firms the flexibil-
ity to exploit specialized niches of consumer demand so that 
economies of scale in production can be applied to upscale but 
geographically scattered markets.
The Benetton clothing company provides an excellent 
case-study example of the exploitation of flexible production 
systems within a single firm. In 1965, the Benetton company 
began with a single factory near Venice. In 1968, it acquired a 
single retail store in the Alpine town of Belluno, marking the 
beginning of a remarkable sequence of corporate expansion. 
Benetton is now a global organization with over 5,000 retail 
outlets in more than 120 countries and its own investment 
bank and financial services organizations. It achieved this 
growth by exploiting computers, new communications and 
transportation systems, flexible outsourcing strategies, and 
new production-process technologies (such as robotics and 
CAD/CAM systems) to the fullest possible extent.
Only about 400 of Benetton's employees are located in the 
company's home base of Treviso, Italy (Figure 8.21). From Trev-
iso, Benetton managers coordinate the activities of more than 
250 outside suppliers in order to stock its worldwide network 
of retail outlet franchises. In Treviso, the firm's designers cre-
ate new shirts and sweaters on CAD terminals, but their designs 
are produced only for orders already in hand, allowing for the 
coordination of production with the purchase of raw materials. 
In factories, rollers linked to a central computer spread and cut 
layers of cloth in small batches according to the numbers and 
colors ordered by Benetton stores around the world. Sweaters, 
gloves, and scarves, knitted in volume in white yarn, are dyed 
in small batches by machines similarly programmed to respond 
to sales orders. Completed garments are warehoused briefly 
(by robots) and shipped out directly (via private package deliv-
ery firms) to individual stores to arrive on their shelves within  
10 days of manufacture.
Sensitivity to demand, however, is the foundation of Ben-
etton's success. Niche marketing and product differentiation 
are central to this sensitivity, which requires a high degree of 
flexibility in exploiting new product lines. Key stores patron-
ized by trendsetting consumers are monitored closely, and 
many Benetton stores' cash registers operate as point-of-sale

terminals so that marketing data are available to company 
headquarters daily. Another notable feature of the company's 
operations is the way that different market niches are exploited 
with the same basic products. In Italy, Benetton products are 
sold through several different retail chains, each with an image 
and decor calculated to bring in a different sort of customer.
Between firms, the flexibility inherent in neo-Fordism 
is achieved through the externalization of certain functions. 
One way of doing this is to reorganize administrative, mana-
gerial, and technical functions into flatter, leaner, and more 
flexible forms of organization that can make increased use 
of outside consultants, specialists, and subcontractors. This 
has led to a degree of vertical disintegration among firms. 
Vertical disintegration involves the evolution from large, 
functionally integrated firms within a given industry toward 
networks of specialized firms, subcontractors, and suppli-
ers. Another route to externalization is participation in joint 
ventures, in the licensing or contracting of technology, and 
in strategic alliances involving design partnerships, col-
laborative R&D projects, and the like. Strategic alliances 
are commercial agreements between transnational corpora-
tions, usually involving shared technologies, marketing net-
works, market research, or product development. They are 
an important contributor to the intensification of economic 
globalization.
Maquiladoras and Export-Processing Zones The 
governments of many peripheral and semiperipheral coun-
tries encourage the type of subcontracting carried out by big 
transnational corporations. These governments see participa-
tion in global assembly lines as a pathway to export-led in-
dustrialization. They offer incentives such as tax "holidays" 
(not having to pay taxes for a specified period) to transnational 
corporations. In the 1960s, Mexico enacted legislation permit-
ting foreign companies to establish "sister factories"—maquila-
doras—within 19 kilometers (12 miles) of the border with the 
United States for the duty-free assembly of products destined 
for reexport (see Figure 8.22). By 2005, more than 3,500 such 
manufacturing and assembly plants had been established, 
employing around a million Mexican workers, most of them 
women, and accounting for more than 30 percent of Mexico's 
exports. But since 2005 hundreds of maquiladoras have closed, 
resulting in the loss of tens of thousands of jobs, as lower wage 
rates and better incentives in other countries—particularly 
China—have proved more attractive to manufacturers.
More common, and more successful, are export-processing 
zones (EPZs): small areas where governments create especially 
favorable investment and trading conditions in order to attract 
export-oriented industries. These conditions include minimum 
levels of bureaucracy, the absence of foreign exchange controls, 
factory space and warehousing at subsidized rents, low tax 
rates, and exemption from tariffs and export duties. In 1985, 
it was estimated that there were a total of 173 EPZs around the 
world, which together employed 1.8 million workers. By 2006, 
there were about 3,500 EPZs, employing about 66 million  
people.1 China alone had 164 EPZs, which together employed 
40 million workers. The International Labor Organization (ILO) 
has criticized EPZs because very few of them have any mean-
ingful links with the domestic economies around them, and 
most trap large numbers of people in low-wage, low-skill jobs.
In addition to tax incentives and EPZs, many governments 
also establish policies that ensure cheap and controllable labor. 
Sometimes countries are pressured to participate in global as-
sembly lines by core countries and by the transnational insti-
tutions they support. The United States and the World Bank, 
for example, have backed regimes that support globalized pro-
duction and have pushed for austerity programs that help keep 
labor cheap in peripheral countries. Countries pursuing export-
led industrialization as an economic development strategy do 
not plan to remain the providers of cheap labor for foreign-based 
transnational corporations, however. They hope to shift from 
labor-intensive manufactured goods to capital-intensive, high-
technology goods, following the path of semiperipheral Asian 
countries like Singapore and South Korea.
Retailing Chains and Global Sourc-
ing At the other end of the commodity chain 
from the farms, mines, maquiladoras, and 
factories of the world are the retail outlets 
and restaurants where the products are sold 
and consumed. Traditionally, retailing and 
food services in developed countries have 
been dominated by small, specialized, inde-
pendent stores and local cafés, restaurants, 
pubs, and bars. But the logic of economic ra-
tionalization and economies of scale has dis-
placed the traditional pattern of downtown 
department stores, main street shops, corner 
stores, and local bars with big-box super-
stores and national and international chains

of retail outlets and restaurants. Town centers once filled with 
a thriving mix of independent and family-owned stores now 
have "cloned" settings consisting of standardized supermarket 
retailers, fast-food chains, mobile phone shops, and fashion 
outlets of global conglomerates. With their cost advantages, 
these chains have become the economic equivalent of invasive 
species: voracious, indiscriminate, and often antisocial. Their 
big, centralized logistical operations have not only put small 
independent stores out of business but are driving the homog-
enization of consumption. The retail sector of most towns and 
cities is now characterized by external control. Decisions about 
hiring, labor policies, wages, stock, and menus are made in 
corporate headquarters hundreds of miles or more away.
Fast-food restaurants have become icons of this trend. 
McDonald's alone has some 33,000 restaurants worldwide 
and opens new ones at the rate of almost 2,000 each year. It 
is the largest purchaser of beef, pork, and potatoes and the 
largest owner of retail property in the world. In the United 
States, 40 percent of meals are eaten outside of the home, most 
of them at fast-food restaurants. One in four adults visits a 
fast-food restaurant every day. Not surprisingly, the majority 
of the population is overweight and the frequency of health 
problems associated with obesity—such as early-onset diabe-
tes and high cholesterol—is rising rapidly. The cost of these 
problems to personal well-being and to health care systems is 
already daunting. Meanwhile, fast food's low-paying service 
sector has become an increasingly significant component of 
the economy.
Equally significant in terms of local economies, local de-
velopment patterns, and global supply chains has been the suc-
cess of "big-box" retail outlets such as Circuit City, Best Buy, 
Office Max, Home Depot, Target, and Wal-Mart. To many ob-
servers, Wal-Mart has come to symbolize the worst characteris-
tics of globalization, including corporate greed, low wages, the 
decline of small-town mom-and-pop stores, and the prolifera-
tion of sweatshops in less developed countries
Supermarket chains have also become particularly influ-
ential. In the United Kingdom, for example, the top four super-
market chains—Tesco, Asda (owned by Wal-Mart), Sainsbury, 
and Safeway—have come to dominate the retail food market 
through a combination of out-of-town superstores and conve-
nience supermarkets along high streets. As a consequence, they 
have killed off small general stores at the rate of one a day and 
specialist shops—such as butchers, bakers, and  fishmongers—
at the rate of 50 per week.
The centralized supply chains of supermarket chains have 
not only killed off small local businesses but also impacted 
local farmers. Supermarket chains rely on big suppliers in 
agribusiness. These suppliers are typically highly subsidized 
national and transnational firms whose global reach depends 
heavily on monoculture and extensive husbandry that, in turn, 
require the extensive use of antibiotics in animals and pesti-
cides, fertilizer, and genetic engineering. As a result, small 
farmers and fishermen have been squeezed from the market. 
And with them many traditional local foods have disappeared 
or are in danger of disappearing. Meanwhile, supermarket 
shelves are lined with highly processed foods, out-of-season 
fruit and vegetables, and produce that has traveled a long way 
and, often, been stored for a while. When the average North 
American or European family sits down to eat, most of the in-
gredients have typically traveled at least 1,500 miles from farm, 
processing, packing, and distribution, to consumption.

New Geographies of Office Employment
The globalization of production and the growth of transna-
tional corporations have brought about another important 
change in patterns of local economic development. Banking, 
finance, and producer services are no longer locally oriented 
ancillary activities but important global industries in their own 
right. They have developed some specific spatial tendencies of 
their own—tendencies that have become important shapers of 
local economic development processes.
One of the most striking trends has been the geographic 
decentralization of office employment. This mainly involves 
"back-office" functions that have been relocated from metro-
politan and business-district locations to small-town and sub-
urban locations. Back-office functions such as record-keeping 
and analytical functions do not require frequent personal 
contact with clients or business associates. Developments in 
computing technologies, database access, electronic data inter-
changes, and telephone call routing technologies are enabling 
a larger share of back-office work to be relocated to specialized 
office space in cheaper settings, freeing space in the high-rent 
locations.
Some prominent examples of back-office decentralization 
from U.S. metropolitan areas have included the relocation of 
back-office jobs at American Express from New York to Salt 
Lake City, Fort Lauderdale, and Phoenix; the relocation of 
Metropolitan Life's back offices to Greenville, South Carolina, 
Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Wichita, Kansas; the relocation of 
Hertz's data-entry division to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Dean 
Witter's to Dallas, Texas, and Avis's to Tulsa, Oklahoma; and 
the relocation of Citibank's MasterCard and Visa divisions to 
Tampa, Florida, and Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Some places 
have actually become specialized back-office locations as a 
result of such decentralization. Omaha, Nebraska, and San 
Antonio, Texas, for example, are centers for a large number of 
telemarketing firms, and Roanoke, VA., has become something 
of a mail-order center.
Internationally, this trend has taken the form of offshore 
back offices. By decentralizing back-office functions to offshore 
locations, companies save even more in labor costs.  Several 
New York-based life-insurance companies, for example, have 
established back-office facilities in Ireland, situated conve-
niently near Ireland's main international airport, Shannon.  
Insurance claim documents are shipped from New York 

via  Federal Express, processed in Ireland, and the results  
beamed back to New York via satellite or the transatlantic  
fiber-optic line.
The next logical step is outsourcing. The outsourcing of 
services is one of the most dynamic sectors of the world econ-
omy. Global outsourcing expenditures are expected to grow 
significantly as small and medium-sized enterprises follow 
the example of large transnational companies in taking advan-
tage of low wages in semiperipheral and peripheral countries  
(Figure 8.23). Typically, international outsourcing in service in-
dustries involves the work of "routine producers" (who process 
data by following instructions, perform repetitive tasks, and re-
spond to explicit procedures) rather than "symbolic analysts" 
(who work with abstract images, are involved with problem-
identifying and problem-solving, and make decisions based 
on critical judgment sharpened by experience). Outsourced 
services range from simple business-process activities (for 
example, data entry, word processing, transcription) to more 
sophisticated, high-value-added activities (for example, archi-
tectural drawing, product support, financial analysis, software 
programming, and human resource services).
India has become one of the most successful exporters of 
outsourced service activities, ranging from call centers and busi-
ness-process activities to advanced IT (information technology) 
services (Figure 8.24). More than 150 of the Fortune 500 com-
panies, for example, now outsource software development to 
India. In the Philippines, special electronic "enterprise zones" 
have been set up with competitive international telephone rates 
for companies specializing in telemarketing and electronic 
commerce. Mexico, South Africa, and Malaysia have also be-
come important locations for call centers and business-process 
activities.
Clusters of Specialized Offices Decentraliza-
tion is outweighed, however, by the tendency for 
a disproportionate share of the new jobs created in 
banking, finance, and business services to cluster in 
highly specialized financial districts within major 
metropolitan areas. The reasons for this localization 
are to be found in another special case of the geo-
graphical agglomeration effects that we discussed ear-
lier in this chapter.
Metropolitan areas such as New York City, Lon-
don, Paris, Tokyo, and Frankfurt have acquired the 
kind of infrastructure—specialized office space, fi-
nancial exchanges, teleports (office parks equipped 
with satellite Earth stations and linked to local fi-
ber-optic lines), and communications networks—
that is essential for delivering services to clients 
with a national or international scope of activity  
(Figure 8.25). These metropolitan areas have also

established a comparative advantage both in the mix of specialized 
firms and expert professionals on hand and in the high-order cul-
tural amenities (available both to high-paid workers and to their 
out-of-town business visitors). Above all, these metro areas have 
established themselves as centers of authority, with a critical mass 
of people in the know about market conditions, trends, and in-
novations. These people gain one another's trust through frequent 
face-to-face contact, not just in business settings but also in the in-
formal settings of clubs and office bars. These key cities have be-
come world cities—places that, in the globalized world economy, 
are able not only to generate powerful spirals of local economic de-
velopment but also to act as pivotal points in the reorganization of 
global space. They are control centers for the flows of information, 
cultural products, and finance that collectively sustain the eco-
nomic and cultural globalization of the world (see Chapter 10 for  
more details).
The Experience Economy and Place 
Marketing
As profitability becomes more challenging in agrarian, indus-
trial, and service enterprises, so businesses have seen an op-
portunity to orchestrate memorable events for their customers, 
with memory itself becoming the "product"—the experience. It 
is not what is sold that characterizes the experience economy, 
but rather the way it is sold. Experience thus becomes a com-
petitive advantage for products and services.
The experience economy is by no means new. Think, for 
example, of sports entertainment, arena rock concerts, fancy 
megamalls with themed enter-
tainment, and visits to muse-
ums and galleries, as well as a 
great deal of traditional tour-
ism. But businesses are increas-
ingly combining commodities, 
products, and services with 
compelling experiences. Res-
taurants organize their services 
around particular themes (pro-
viding marketers with a new 
term: "eatertainment"). Shops 
and malls organize shows, 
events, or expositions ("shop-
pertainment"). There are now 
dental practices and general 
medical practices that double as 
day spas, while some manufac-
turers have established flagship 
stores that have a significant 
experiential component: Nike 
Town, SegaWorld, and Warner 
Studio "Villages," for example. 
In addition, some businesses 
are based on selling new kinds 
of experiences. Ciudad de los 
niños (Kids City), for example, 
charges an admission fee to an 
entire "shopping mall" where 
children play-shop and play-work. Similarly, American Girl 
Place offers a combination of attractions specifically targeted 
at young girls: a doll hair salon, special café, a theater featur-
ing musicals, and shops with dolls and outfits. The American 
Girl Web site advertises "Café. Theater. Shops. Memories."2
In the experience economy it is important to capitalize on 
places because, as we saw in Chapter 6, places have the capac-
ity to arouse distinctive feelings and attachments. At the same 
time, thanks to economic and cultural globalization, places 
and regions throughout the world are increasingly seeking to 
influence the ways in which they are perceived by tourists, 
businesses, media firms, and consumers. As a result, places are 
increasingly being reinterpreted, reimagined, designed, pack-
aged, and marketed. Through place marketing, sense of place 
has become a valuable commodity and culture has become an 
important economic activity.
Seeking to be competitive within the globalizing econ-
omy, many places have sponsored extensive makeovers of 
themselves, including the creation of pedestrian plazas, cos-
mopolitan cultural facilities, festivals, and sports and media 
events—what geographer David Harvey has described as the 
"carnival masks" and "businessmen's utopias" of global capi-
talism. An increasing number of places have also set up home 
pages on the Internet containing maps, information, photo-
graphs, guides, and virtual spaces in order to promote them-
selves in the global marketplace.

8.4 Geography Matters
Some global firms—like Starbucks, Google and Amazon—have come under 
fire in many countries for avoiding paying much tax on sales outside the US. 
Companies have long had complicated tax structures, but a recent series of 
stories has highlighted a number of tax-avoiding firms accused of not paying 
their fair share. Starbucks, for example, had sales of U.S. $675 million in the 
United Kingdom in 2012, but paid no corporate tax. Meanwhile, the com-
pany was able to transfer money to a Dutch sister company in royalty pay-
ments, bought coffee beans from Switzerland, and paid high interest rates to 
borrow from other parts of the business. Amazon, with sales in the United 
Kingdom of U.S. $7.7 billion in 2011, only reported a "tax expense" of U.S. 
$3 million. And Google's U. K. unit paid just U.S. $10.2 million to the British 
Treasury in 2011 on U.K. turnover of U.S. $670 million.
But everything these companies are doing is legal—it's tax avoidance and 
not tax evasion. Why are people outraged? Across the world, countries are 
experiencing deep reductions in public spending and real austerity cutting 
payments for public goods (schools, transportation, etc.) and human welfare 
(unemployment payments, food stamps, etc.). Tax avoidance is not a victim-
less crime. Discussions about the ethics of corporate tax avoidance are now 
everywhere.
This tax avoidance reflects the fact that different countries have very dif-
ferent rates for taxes on businesses and taxes on private incomes. Businesses 
have a massive incentive to minimize their taxes both at home and abroad.
Businesses might locate factories, service and distribution hubs, and re-
gional headquarters in low-tax jurisdictions. Starbucks sources its U.K. coffee 
from a wholesale trading subsidiary in Switzerland. And Google operates 
subsidiaries in Bermuda and Ireland to take advantage of no and low taxes, 
respectively. Businesses also practice "transfer pricing." Transfer pricing oc-
curs when a division of a multinational business in one country charges one 
of its divisions in another country for a product or a service. As a result,  
artificially high charges can be levied internally to siphon money from a high-
tax country to a low-tax one.
How has this world in which taxes are driving these kinds of business de-
cisions emerged? There are three major factors.
1. Globally, the geopolitics of globalization. The United States 
facilitated the opening up of the world economy. Since the end of 
World War II in 1945, the United States has been the world's most 
important country economically and militarily. U.S. economic and 
cultural influence around the world has been profound. After the 
Cold War with the Soviet Union, during which the United States 
championed private ownership of land and industry, the United 
States began removing barriers to trade such as tariffs and quotas. 
The United States also provided the world's main currency for 
world trade. U.S.-based multinational businesses and banks  
were important sponsors and beneficiaries of policies that  
opened up the world economy under U.S. government auspices. 
That enabled the global supply chains and massive changes in  
patterns of economic development discussed in this chapter.  
The U.S. government stands behind these companies and their 
global operations.
 
2. Nationally, the geopolitics of development—the differences 
between states to mobilize their populations to pursue economic 
development and invest in public goods and infrastructure. Some 
governments have been more adept than others at exploiting the 
opportunities provided by a more open world economy. China's 
great success in improving its level of economic development and 
reducing its number of low-income people is not just due to its 
ability to exploit its vast pool of relatively cheap labor. The abili-
ties to mobilize populations and create opportunities in global 
markets are key aspects to a country's success in the global mar-
ketplace. Mobilizing a population requires some degree of cul-
tural homogeneity. And a population's acceptance of government 
legitimacy is important to foreign and domestic investors who ex-
pect political stability and minimal workplace disruptions. Accept-
ing a government's legitimacy requires a clear sense that some 
economic activities (e.g., banking) need considerable government 
control. Investment in infrastructures such as ports, railways, and 
highways, and investment in public goods, such as general educa-
tion and health care, also produce favorable settings for profitable 
private investment.
 
3. Institutionally, the increasingly complex system of regulation.  
Since the 1970s, world economic development has been regu-
lated not just by governments within countries, but by increasingly 
influential private, quasi-public and international organizations. 
Private organizations such as credit-rating agencies rate the riski-
ness of bonds issued by businesses and governments. Their deci-
sions are based on the claim that they have specialist knowledge 
and "independence" not available to governmental organizations. 
So when governments try to raise revenues by selling bonds, they 
are subject to the authority exercised by these agencies. Quasi-
public organizations and their regulations also have an impact. 
Most national central banks have a high degree of political inde-
pendence from their governments—they decide how much cur-
rency to issue and fix interest rates and exchange rates—with an 
eye on global markets rather than their own governments. Other 
regulatory effects are a result of international financial and devel-
opment organizations such as the International Monetary Fund 
and the World Bank. These organizations support governments 
in difficult economic circumstances—if those governments follow 
policy prescriptions designed by those organizations.
Much of the world's private financial economy is increasingly mov-
ing  "offshore" to avoid as much national and global regulation as possible  
(Table 8.2). To take advantage of low or nonexistent corporate and per-
sonal income taxes, many transnational businesses now incorporate in tax

havens such as the Cayman Islands (Figure 8.E). Major global financial 
 institutions in New York and London provide the nerve centers for this 
cross-jurisdictional circulation of corporate profits.
As a result of all these factors, a major crisis is brewing. The massive avoid-
ance of taxes not only creates opportunities for "money laundering" of illegal 
activities, it also reduces the revenues that governments need to provide the 
public investments necessary for successful economic development. This is 
why "tax avoidance" has become a hot button political issue.
1. Why was the reduction in average tariffs on manufactured goods 
crucial for the growth of global supply chains?
 
2. Why is a relatively open and market-based financial system 
 important for globalization?
 
3. Why has so much economic regulation slipped out of the hands 
of governments and into the hands of private and international 
organizations?

HUMAN GEOGRAPHY   Places and Regions in Global Context
Central to place marketing is the deliberate manipulation of 
culture in an effort to enhance the appeal of places to key groups.  
These groups include the upper-level management of large 
corporations, the higher-skilled and better-educated person-
nel sought by expanding high-technology industries, wealthy 
tourists, and the organizers of business and professional con-
ferences and other income-generating events. In part, place 
marketing strategies depend on promoting traditions, life-
styles, and arts that are locally rooted; in part, they depend on 
being able to tap into globalizing culture through new cultural 
amenities and specially organized events and exhibitions. 
Some of the most widely adopted strategies include fund-
ing for experiential settings for the arts, investment in public 
spaces, the re-creation and refurbishment of distinctive set-
tings like waterfronts and historic districts, the expansion 
and improvement of museums (especially with blockbuster 
exhibitions of spectacular cultural products that attract large 
crowds and can be marketed with commercial tie-ins), and 
the designation and conservation of historic landmarks.

As we have seen, technological breakthroughs and the avail-
ability of resources have had a profound influence on past pat-
terns of development, and the same factors will certainly be a 
strong influence on future economic geographies. The expan-
sion of the world economy and the globalization of industry 
will undoubtedly boost the overall demand for raw materials 
of various kinds, and this will spur the development of some 
previously underexploited but resource-rich regions in Africa, 
Eurasia, and East Asia.
Raw materials, however, will represent only a fraction of fu-
ture resource needs. The main issue, by far, will be energy re-
sources. World energy consumption has been increasing steadily 
over the recent past, and as the periphery is industrialized and its 
population increases, the global demand for energy will expand 
rapidly. Basic industrial development tends to be highly energy-
intensive. The International Energy Agency, assuming (fairly 
optimistically) that energy in peripheral countries will be gener-
ated in the future as efficiently as it is today in core countries, 
estimates that developing-country energy consumption will in-
crease dramatically, lifting total world energy demand by almost 
50 percent by 2020. Peripheral and semiperipheral countries will 
then account for more than half of world energy consumption. 
Much of this will be driven by industrialization geared to meet 
the growing worldwide market for consumer goods, such as pri-
vate automobiles, air conditioners, refrigerators, televisions, and 
household appliances (Figure 8.26).
▼ Figure 8.26 Spreading consumerism Customers shop for a television at an eZone retail showroom in the  
Jayanagae area in Bangalore, India. 

CHAPTER 8   Geographies of Economic Development   319
Without higher rates of investment in exploration and ex-
traction than at present, production will be slow to meet the 
escalating demand. Many experts believe that current levels of 
production in fact represent "peak oil" and that by 2020 global 
oil production may be only 90 percent of its current level. The 
result might well be a significant increase in energy prices. 
This would have important geographical ramifications: Com-
panies would need to seriously reconsider their operations 
and force core-region households into a reevaluation of their 
residential preferences and commuting behavior, while periph-
eral-region households would be driven deeper into poverty. If 
the oil-price crisis of 1973 is anything to go by (after crude oil 
prices had been quadrupled by the OPEC cartel), the outcome 
could be a major revision of patterns of industrial location 
and metropolitan areas. Significantly higher energy costs may 
change the optimal location for many manufacturers, leading 
to deindustrialization in some regions and to new spirals of 
cumulative causation in others. Higher fuel costs will encour-
age some people to live nearer their place of work; others will 
be able to take advantage of telecommuting to reduce personal 
transportation costs.   
It is also relevant to note that almost all of the increase 
in oil production over the next 15 or 20 years is likely to 
come from outside the core economies. This means that 
the world economy will become increasingly dependent 
on OPEC governments, which control over 70 percent of all 
proven oil reserves, most of them in the politically unstable 
Middle East.
Given what we know about past processes of geographic 
change and principles of spatial organization, it is clear that 
changes in transportation technology are also of fundamen-
tal importance. Consider, for example, the impact of ocean-
going steamers and railroads on the changing geographies of 
the nineteenth century and the impact of automobiles and 
trucks on the changing geographies of the twentieth century. 
Among the most important of the next generation of trans-
portation technologies that will influence future geographies 
are high-speed rail systems, smart roads, and smart cars.
Meanwhile, the impact of climate change on future eco-
nomic geographies will depend a great deal on the latitude, 
altitude, and topography of places and regions. The 2014 re-
port of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
stressed that climate change will affect various energy sources 
and technologies differently, depending on the resources, the 
technological processes, and the locations (e.g., coastal re-
gions, floodplains) involved. Climate change is also likely to 
influence the integrity and reliability of pipelines and elec-
tricity grids and will have both positive and negative impacts 
on water supply infrastructure and water demand. It will 
negatively affect transport infrastructure and many tourism 
resorts, particularly ski resorts, beach resorts, and nature re-
sorts will be at risk. Nevertheless, the IPCC report concluded 
that for most economic sectors, the impact of climate change 
will be small relative to the impacts of other drivers such as 
changes in population, income distribution, technology, life-
styles, and regulation.

LEARNING OUTCOMES REVISITED
■ Scrutinize the nature and degree of unevenness in patterns of 
economic development at national and international scales.
At the global scale, unevenness takes the form of core-pe-
riphery contrasts. Similar core-periphery contrasts exist at 
the regional scale. The core regions within the world-sys-
tem—North America, Europe, and Japan—have the most 
diversified economies, the most advanced technologies, 
the highest levels of productivity, and the highest levels 
of prosperity. Other countries and regions—the periphery 
and semiperiphery of the world-system—are often referred 
to as developing or less developed. The average GNI per 
capita of the ten most prosperous countries in the world 
is 67 times greater than the average GNI per capita of the 
ten poorest countries. Overall, more than 80 percent of the 
world's population lives in countries where income differ-
entials are widening.
■ Compare how different regions of the world contribute to 
technological innovation and how interdependent the global 
economy is on these technological systems.
Technology systems are clusters of interrelated en-
ergy, transportation, and production technologies 
that dominate economic activity for several decades 
at a time—until a new cluster of improved technolo-
gies evolves. Technology systems have evolved at 
50-year intervals in the world, starting with the In-
dustrial Revolution (1790-1840) and at subsequent 
intervals in 1840-1890; 1890-1950; 1950-1990,  
and 1990 onward. With a direct impact on economic 
 development, technology has spread from different 
points of origin in each interval, and creates a web of 
production, trade, and communication around the world.
■ Analyze how geographical divisions of labor have evolved with 
the growth of the world-system and the accompanying varia-
tions in economic structure.
Geographical divisions of labor are national, regional, and 
locally based economic specializations in primary, sec-
ondary, tertiary, or quaternary activities. The relationship 
between changing regional economic specialization and 
changing levels of prosperity has prompted the interpre-
tation of economic development in distinctive stages. In 
reality, however, various pathways exist to development, 
as well as various processes and outcomes of develop-
ment. A new international division of labor was initiated 
in the 1970s as a result of a major wave of corporate glo-
balization. This new international division of labor has 
resulted in three main changes: the decline of the United 
States as an industrial producer, the decentralization of 
manufacturing production from the world's core regions 
to some semiperipheral and peripheral countries, and the 
emergence of new specializations in high-tech manufac-
turing and producer services within the core regions of 
the world-system.
CONCLUSION
Economic development is not simply a sequential process of 
modernization and increasing affluence. Economic develop-
ment involves not only using the latest technology to generate 
higher incomes but also improving the quality of life through 
better housing, health care, and social welfare systems, and en-
hancing the physical framework, or infrastructure, on which 
the economy rests.
Local, regional, and international patterns and processes of 
economic development are of particular importance to geogra-
phers. Levels of economic development and local processes of 
economic change affect many aspects of local well-being and 
so contribute to many aspects of human geography. Economic 
development is an important place-making process that under-
pins much of the diversity among regions and nations. At the 
same time, it is a reflection and a product of variations in natu-
ral resources, demographic characteristics, political systems, 
and social customs.
Economic development is an uneven geographic phenom-
enon. Regional patterns of economic development are tied to 
the geographic distribution of resources and to the legacy of 
the past specializations of places and regions. A general ten-
dency exists toward the creation of regional cores with depen-
dent peripheries. Nevertheless, such patterns are not fixed or 
static. Changing economic conditions can lead to the modifica-
tion or reversal of core-periphery patterns, as in the stagnation 
of once-booming regions like northern England and the spec-
tacular growth of Guangdong Province in Southeast China. 
Over the long term, core-periphery patterns have most often 
been modified as a result of the changing locational needs and 
opportunities of successive technology systems. Today, eco-
nomic globalization has exposed more places and regions than 
ever to the ups and downs of episodes of creative destruc-
tion—episodes played out ever faster, thanks to the way that 
technological innovations have shrunk time and space.
At the global scale, the unevenness of economic devel-
opment takes the form of core-periphery contrasts. Most 
striking about these contrasts today are the dynamism and 
pace of change involved in economic development. The 
global assembly line, the global office, and global tourism 
are all making places much more interdependent and much 
faster changing. Parts of Brazil, China, India, Mexico, and 
South Korea, for example, have developed quickly from ru-
ral backwaters into significant industrial regions. This dy-
namism has, however, brought with it an expanding gap 
between rich and poor at every spatial scale: international, 
regional, and local.

CHAPTER 8   Geographies of Economic Development   321
■ Interpret how regional cores of economic development are 
created, following some initial advantage, through the opera-
tion of several basic principles of spatial organization.
Any significant initial local economic advantage—exist-
ing labor markets, consumer markets, frameworks of fixed 
social capital, and so on—tends to be reinforced through 
a process of cumulative causation, a spiral buildup of 
advantages that occurs in specific geographic settings as 
a result of the development of external economies, ag-
glomeration effects, and localization economies. The 
agglomeration effects that are associated with various 
kinds of economic linkages and interdependencies—the 
cost advantages that accrue to individual firms because 
of their location among functionally related activities—
are particularly important in driving cumulative causa-
tion. Spirals of local growth tend to attract people and 
investment funds from other areas. According to the basic 
principles of spatial interaction, these flows tend to be 
strongest from nearby regions and those with the lowest 
wages, fewest job opportunities, or least attractive invest-
ment opportunities.
■ Explain how spirals of economic development can be arrested 
in various ways, including the onset of disinvestment and 
deindustrialization.
Core-periphery patterns and relationships can be modi-
fied by changes that can slow or modify the spiral of cu-
mulative causation. The main factor is the development 
of agglomeration diseconomies, the negative economic 
effects of urbanization, and the local concentration of 
industry. Spirals of cumulative causation can also be 
undermined by changes in the relative costs of the fac-
tors of land, labor, or capital; by the obsolescence of 
infrastructure and technology; or by the process of import 
substitution, whereby goods and services previously im-
ported from core regions come to be replaced by locally 
made goods and locally provided services. The capital 
made available from disinvestment in core regions be-
comes available for investment by entrepreneurs in new 
ventures based on innovative products and innovative 
production technologies. This process is often referred to 
as creative destruction.
■ Demonstrate how globalization has resulted in patterns and 
processes of local and regional economic development that 
are open to external influences.
The globalization of the world economy involves a new 
international division of labor in association with the in-
ternationalization of finance, the deployment of a new 
technology system, and the homogenization of consumer 
markets. This new framework for economic geography 
has meant that the lives of people in different parts of 
the world have become increasingly intertwined. Trans-
national corporations now control a large fraction of the 
world's productive assets, and the largest of them are more 
powerful, in economic terms, than most sovereign nations. 
As these corporations have restructured their activities 
and redeployed their resources among different countries, 
regions, and places, they have created many new linkages 
and interdependencies among places and regions around 
the world. Even small and medium-sized companies are 
involved in the myriad global assembly lines and supply 
chains that characterize the contemporary world economy, 
linking the fortunes of diverse and often distant local 
economies.

1. While India's per capita income is well below that of the 
United States (Figure 8.1), India has more people who earn 
the equivalent of $70,000 or above a year than the United 
States does. How can you explain this, and what might be 
some of the consequences from the point of view of eco-
nomic geography?
2. Write a short essay (500 words, or two double-spaced 
typed pages) on any local specialized manufacturing region 
or office district with which you are familiar. Describe the 
different kinds of firms that are found there, and suggest 
the kinds of linkages between them that might be consid-
ered examples of agglomeration effects. (Hint: You might 
consider the manufacturing of cars. How many parts are 
needed to make an entire car? What other firms are needed 
in the production? Do they come from the same place or 
are they manufactured in different locations? Are the parts 
manufactured in one place, region, or country? How would 
this be an example of agglomeration effects?)
 3. Consider the economic structure of the city or town you 
live in. List two primary, secondary, tertiary, and qua-
ternary activities in your region. How might these ac-
tivities lead to one part of your city or town being more 
economically developed than others? Finally, consider 
where you fit into these economic structures. If you work 
in a community business, what is your labor used to 
produce?
REVIEW & DISCUSSION
1. Could your group measure the ecological footprint of your 
specific place? What data would you need to make an in-
formed statement? Is your city considered a "sustainable" 
or "green" city? Why or why not? List three things in your 
community that might contribute to sustainable or unsus-
tainable development.
2. Research the businesses in the area connected to your 
neighborhood. Create a list of the stores. Determine 
whether or not the stores are locally owned. What is the 
ratio of locally owned to big-box retail or chain stores? 
As a comparative study, consider other neighborhoods 
that are close to yours. Create a list of the locally owned 
stores and big-box retail or chain stores. How many 
similarities are there, in terms of businesses? How many 
differences? What does this say about the economic 
structures of your neighborhood? Do most people in your 
community work for chain or big-box stores, or are there 
many entrepreneurs and small business owners?
 3. After rereading the section on Fair Trade in the chap-
ter, walk with your group to a neighborhood food store 
and create a list of fair trade products. What is the 
percentage of Fair Trade products versus not fair trade 
products in the store? What does this say about the eco-
nomic structure of the food store? Does it make a dif-
ference to you as a consumer whether a product is Fair 
Trade or not?

DATA ANALYSIS
In this chapter, we have looked at global and 
domestic economic energies, to answer among 
other questions: Where in the world is money 
made and retained? In January 2014, the World 
Economic Forum met in Davos, Switzerland. At 
the same time, Oxfam International released a 
report called, "Working for the Few" in which 
several startling statistics were reported, including that the 
85 richest people in the world have as much wealth as the 
3.5 billion poorest. What do you think are some of the causes 
of increasing disparity, reflecting on what you learned in 
this chapter? Go to Oxfam's report summary at http://www.
oxfam.org/sites/www.oxfam.org/files/bp-working-for-few-
political-capture-economic-inequality-200114-summ-en.pdf 
and answer these questions:
 1. What percentage of the world's population own half the 
world's wealth?
 2. In the United States, what percentage of the population has 
experienced financial growth since 2008? What percentage 
has gotten poorer?
 3. Where does the wealthiest percentage of the world's  
population live?
 4. Where do the poorest live?
Now that you have the global forecast, consider the results 
of a global economy on domestic workforces and personal 
incomes. How do most Americans make a living? Let's look 
closer at the U.S. economy and create a projection based on 
current data. Start at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 
Web site (http://www.bls.gov/home.htm) and look up "Eco-
nomic Indicators" to answer these questions:
 5. What are the indicators economists have chosen to deter-
mine the health of the economy?
 6. Compare the categories for "Employment Situation" to 
"Consumer Price Index" and "Producer Price Index." Why 
do these categories comprise major pieces of the economy?
 7. Next look at the unemployment rates for the past year. How 
is unemployment dispersed throughout the United States, 
that is, are some areas more unemployed then others?
Compare this data to the Bureau for Labor Statistics' data graphs 
for NPR called "What  America Does for Work" at http://www 
.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/03/20/149015363 
/what-america-does-for-work.
 8. What sectors employ the majority of 
Americans?
 9. Look at these numbers and compare the first 
graph to the second graph of where most 
 Americans worked in 1972. What has changed?
 10. In your opinion, do you think there is such a thing as a do-
mestic economy in a globalized world? Why or why not?
11. Finally analyze how you think growing disparity will  
affect the health and harmony of the planet. Why are  
policymakers and scholars concerned about the "growing 
tide of inequality"?

OF FOOD AND 
AGRICULTURE

Visit most any city in the periphery and you'll find vendors along the 
street selling locally prepared food—often called street food—from temporary 
stands and carts. In the core, large cities sometimes host their own set of such 
food vendors, though the choice of food is usually far more limited—pretzels, 
hot dogs, roasted chestnuts in winter, ice cream in summer—than in the pe-
riphery. In Mexico City, for instance, food vendors—known as ambulantes—
sell fresh cut fruit (in plastic bags that look like transparent ice cream cones) 
sprinkled with lime juice and cayenne pepper, as well as tacos, tortas (sand-
wiches), tlacoyos (masa patties filled with cheese or beans), camotes (sweet 
potatoes), chicharones (pork rinds), roasted ears of corn, fresh fruit juices, 
and a wide assortment of other treats. The food is frequently delicious, very 
portable, and quite inexpensive, largely due to the low overhead costs of sell-
ing it from a non-permanent site. This food and these vendors are highly im-
portant to the local economy providing inexpensive choices to well-off and 
poor locals and tourists who write endless blogs about where the best street 
food is around the globe.
The street vendors of Mexico City provide a window into the many ways and 
types of places food is available for consumption from carts, to outdoor markets, 
to supermarkets (including grocery chains and superstores Walmart and Target), 
pickup truck beds, farm stands, corner grocery stores, online providers, vending 
machines, and buyers' clubs like Costco and Sam's Club in the United States.
In the core, an increasingly popular form of edibles vending is the food truck, 
a hipster variation on a previous trend that began in the late nineteenth cen-
tury. Contemporary food trucks—vehicles that both transport and are the site 
for selling food—are also exploding in number of cities in parts of Asia and in 
cities across Australia, and in Canada, Belgium, France, the United Kingdom  
and Mexico. A few offer frozen or pre-packaged food, like the traditional ice 
cream truck; most are more like restaurant kitchens on wheels. In the United 
States, the current trend in food trucks emerged in Los Angeles with the 

326 
HUMAN GEOGRAPHY   Places and Regions in Global Context
company, Kogi Korean BBQ. A high-end culinary ex-
perience, Kogi is a fusion of Korean and Mexican food. 
And once Kogi, which generated a clientele through 
Twitter, hit the streets, other creative culinary food 
trucks soon followed suit so that they have become 
a staple of the urban landscape in large cities in the 
United States from coast to coast.
The first food truck in the United States is reported to 
have been put into service when, in 1872, a vendor in 
Rhode Island cut windows into a small horse-drawn 
freight wagon and started selling comestibles to late-
night newspaper workers at the Providence Journal. 
These vehicles came to be known as lunch wagons and 
were soon being custom-produced to include sinks, re-
frigerators, and cooking stoves. Before long, the lunch 
wagons lost their wheels and became stationary din-
ing cars and ultimately became the classic American 
diner. These locally owned and operated restaurants 
serving homemade food have largely disappeared from 
the landscape and been replaced by imitation diners 
that are part of national chains, such as Denny's, which 
calls itself "America's diner."
Like the diner, which persists across the U.S. land-
scape despite the small total number, the descendants 
of early food trucks also thrived on the edges of urban 
growth and change, though none of them as upscale or 
adventurous as the current ones. For instance, "roach 
coaches," aluminum-sided vending trucks still oper-
ate providing breakfast and lunch staples—coffee and 
pastries, packaged sandwiches, candy bars, chips and 
soda—to distant construction sites or places where 
plain food is is not readily available. In fact, these shiny 
trucks are a model for some of the retro food trucks of 
today that offer more elaborate culinary delights.
How we get our food, and where we eat it is as much 
a part of food and agricultural geographies as the other 
areas of interest we cover in this chapter. From agricul-
tural production, processing, distribution, and financ-
ing to issues of food consumption, such as access and 
quality, geographers are interested in understanding 
this most essential element of human life.
TRADITIONAL AGRICULTURAL 
GEOGRAPHY
In this chapter, we examine the geography of food and agricul-
ture from the global to the household and individual level. We 
begin by exploring traditional agricultural practices and pro-
ceed through the three major revolutions of agricultural change. 
Much of the chapter is devoted to understanding the ways ge-
ographers have investigated the dramatic transformations in 
agriculture over 50 plus years as it has become increasingly 
industrialized through technological, political, social, and eco-
nomic forces. We also treat the effects globalization has had on 
producing, marketing, delivering, and consuming food.
The study of agriculture has a long tradition in geography. 
Because of geographers' interest in the relationships between 
people and land, it is hardly surprising that agriculture has 
been a primary concern. Geography is committed to viewing 
the physical and human systems as interactively linked. This 
approach combines an understanding of spatial differentiation 
and the importance of place as well as the recognition that ag-
riculture practices are affected by local, regional, national, and 
globally extensive structures and processes.
One of the most widely recognized and appreciated con-
tributions that geography has made to the study of agriculture 
is the mapping of the factors that shape it. Geographers map 
soil, temperature, and terrain, as well as the areal distribution 
of different types of agriculture and the relationships among 
and between agriculture and other practices or variables. They 
also map a host of other aspects of food and agriculture from 
the distribution of processing plants and grocery stores to the 
availability of fresh produce and the number of school and 
community gardens in poor urban neighborhoods.
Major changes in agriculture worldwide have occurred in 
the last five decades. Of these, the possibility that increases in 
food production will not keep pace with increases in popula-
tion and that the planet is at the limit of arable land and fresh 
water is perhaps the most worrisome. Add to that very diffi-
cult challenge, the decline in the number of people employed 
in farming in both the core and the periphery and the impacts 
of climate change on agriculture and the result is a global ag-
ricultural system, and the physical environment on which it 
depends, that is gravely endangered (Figure 9.1).
Before we begin to understand the present state of the ag-
ricultural system, it's valuable to learn some of the basic ter-
minology for talking about food and agriculture as well as to 
review our history as food producers more generally. That re-
view will provide a foundation for appreciating and recogniz-
ing the value of some of the alternative agricultural practices 
emerging in response to a whole host of food production, ac-
cess, and consumption issues that we also deal with later in 
this chapter.
Agricultural Practices
Agriculture is a science, an art, and a business directed at the 
cultivation of crops and the raising of livestock for sustenance 
and profit. The unique and ingenious methods humans have 
learned to transform the land through agriculture are an impor-
tant reflection of the two-way relationship between people and 
their environments (Figure 9.2a and 9.2b). Just as geography 
shapes our choices and behaviors, so we are able to shape the 
physical landscape to meet our needs.
In examining agricultural practices, geographers have 
sought to understand the myriad ways humans have learned 
to modify the natural world around them to nourish them-
selves, their families, and ultimately the global community. In 
addition to understanding agricultural systems, geographers 

CHAPTER 9   Geographies of Food and Agriculture   327
are also interested in investigating the lifestyles and cultures 
of different agricultural communities. They and other social 
scientists often use the adjective agrarian to describe the way 
of life that is deeply embedded in the demands of agricultural 
production. Agrarian not only defines the culture of distinctive 
agricultural communities but also refers to the type of tenure 
(or landholding) system that determines who has access to land 
and what kind of cultivation practices are employed there.
Origins and Change in Agriculture
While there is no definitive answer as to where agriculture 
originated, we know that before humans discovered the advan-
tages of agriculture, they procured their food through hunting 
(including fishing) and gathering. Hunting and gathering char-
acterize activities through which people feed themselves by 
killing wild animals and marine species and gathering fruits, 
roots, nuts, and other edible plants. Subsistence agriculture re-
placed hunting and gathering activities in many parts of the 
globe when people came to understand that the domestica-
tion of animals and plants could enable them to settle in one 
place rather than having to go off routinely in search of edible 
animals and plants (Figure 9.3). Subsistence agriculture is a 
system in which agriculturalists consume most of what they 
produce.
During the twentieth century, the dominant agricultural 
system in the core countries became commercial agriculture, a 
system in which farmers produce crops and animals primarily 
for sale rather than for direct consumption by themselves and 
their families (Figure 9.4). Worldwide, subsistence agriculture 
is diminishing as increasing numbers of places are incorpo-
rated into a globalized economy with a substantial commer-
cial agricultural sector. Still widely practiced in the periphery, 
however, subsistence activities usually follow one of three 
dominant forms: shifting cultivation, intensive subsistence ag-
riculture, and pastoralism.
Shifting Cultivation
In shifting cultivation, farmers aim to maintain soil fertility by 
rotating the fields they cultivate. Shifting cultivation contrasts 
with another method of maintaining soil fertility, crop rota-
tion, in which the fields under cultivation remain the same, 
but the crops planted are changed to balance the types of nutri-
ents withdrawn from and delivered to the soil.
Shifting cultivation is globally distributed in the tropics—
especially in the rain forests of Central and West Africa; the 
Amazon in South America; and much of Southeast Asia, in-
cluding Thailand, Burma, Malaysia, and Indonesia—where cli-
mate, rainfall, and vegetation combine to produce soils lacking 
nutrients. The practices involved in shifting cultivation have 
changed very little over thousands of years (Figure 9.5). Shift-
ing cultivation requires only human energy as compared with 
modern forms of farming, though, not surprisingly it can suc-
cessfully support only low population densities since the total 
amount of crop produced is not large.

equator will see increased production but most others, as the map shows, will be far worse off by 2080.

HUMAN GEOGRAPHY   Places and Regions in Global Context
The typical agrarian system that supports shifting cultiva-
tion is one in which small groups of villagers hold land in com-
mon tenure. Through collective agreement or a ruling council, 
sites are distributed among village families and then cleared 
for planting by family members. As villages grow, tillable sites 
must be located farther and farther away. When population 
growth reaches a critical stage, several families within the vil-
lage normally split off to establish another village in one of the 
more remote sites.
The typical method for preparing a new site is through 
slash-and-burn agriculture. Existing plants are cropped close 
to the ground, left to dry for a period, and then ignited. The 
burning process adds valuable nutrients to the soil, such as 
potash, which is about the only fertilizer that is readily avail-
able and free of charge. Once the land is cleared and ready 
for cultivation, it is known as swidden (see Chapter 2). While 
generally an agricultural practice that is workable when under-
taken by small populations on limited portions of land, slash-
and-burn is also seen to be ecologically destructive when large 
numbers of farmers participate, especially in areas with vul-
nerable and endangered species, such as rain forests.
From region to region the kinds of crops grown and their 
arrangement in the swidden vary depending upon local taste 
and plant domestication histories. In the warm, humid tropics, 
tubers—sweet potatoes and yams—predominate, while grains 
such as corn or rice are more widely planted in the subtropics.

The practice of mixing different seeds and seedlings in the same 
swidden is called intertillage (Figure 9.6). Not only are different 
plants cultivated, but their planting is usually staggered so that 
harvesting can continue throughout the year. Staggered plant-
ing and harvesting reduces the risk of disasters from crop failure 
and increases the nutritional balance of the diet. Shifting culti-
vation also frequently involves a gender division of labor that 
may vary from region to region (Figure 9.7). For the most part, 
men are largely responsible for the initial tasks of clearing away 
vegetation, cutting down trees, and burning the stumps. Women 
are typically involved with sowing seeds and harvesting crops.
Although sometimes heralded as an ingenious, well- 
balanced response to the environmental constraints of the 
tropics and subtropics, shifting cultivation is not without limi-
tations. Its most obvious limitation is that it can be effective 
only with small populations. Population growth and the greater 
need for increased outputs per acre have led to its  replacement 
by more intensive forms of agriculture.
Intensive Subsistence Agriculture
The second dominant form of subsistence activity is intensive 
subsistence agriculture, a practice involving the effective and ef-
ficient use of a small parcel of land to maximize crop yield; a con-
siderable expenditure of human labor and application of fertilizer 
are also usually involved. Unlike shifting cultivation, intensive 
subsistence cultivation can often support larger populations. 
Shifting cultivation is more characteristic of low agricultural 
densities, whereas intensive subsistence normally reflects high 
agricultural density. Consequently, intensive subsistence usually 
occurs in Asia, especially in India, China, and Southeast Asia.
Recall that shifting cultivation involves the application of a 
relatively limited amount of labor and other resources to cultiva-
tion. Conversely, intensive subsistence agriculture involves fairly 
constant human labor to achieve high productivity from a small 
amount of land. In the face of fierce population pressure and 
limited arable land, intensive subsistence agriculture reflects the 
inventive ways humans confront environmental constraints and  
▶ Figure 9.5 Shifting cultivation One way to maintain 
soil fertility is by rotating the fields within which cultivation 
occurs. Land rotation—also called shifting cultivation—is 
pictured here as agriculturalists prepare a new field so that 
the old fields can "rest" and be regenerated. It is also pos-
sible to plant certain crops to restore soil fertility. That is, a 
crop that leaches the soil of one kind of nutrient is followed 
during the next growing season by a dissimilar crop that 
returns that nutrient to the soil.
▲ Figure 9.6 Intertillage Planting different crops together in the same field 
has many benefits, including the spreading out of food production over the 
farming season, reduction of disease and pest loss, greater protection from loss 
of soil moisture, and control of soil erosion. This diagram illustrates what an in-
tertilled site might contain and how the planting is arranged. Hill-planted seeds 
have tall stalks and a deeper root system; those planted on flat earth tend to be 
spreading plants that produce large leaves for shading. Part A is meant to show 
how the plants would look as you gaze down on them. Part B shows a side view.

reshape the landscape in the process. In fact, the landscape of in-
tensive subsistence agriculture is often a distinctive one, includ-
ing raised fields and terraced hillside plots (Figure 9.8).
Intensive subsistence agriculture is able to support large 
rural populations. In contrast to shifting cultivation, fields are 
planted year after year as fertilizers and other soil enhancers are 
applied to maintain soil nutrients. For the most part, the limita-
tions on the size of plots have more to do with the size of the 
population than geographical conditions. In Bangladesh and 
southern China, for example, where a significant proportion 
of the population is engaged in intensive subsistence agricul-
ture, land is passed down from generation to generation—usu-
ally from fathers to sons—so that each successive generation, if 
there are multiple male offspring, receives a smaller and smaller 
share of the family holdings. Yet even with shrinking plot size 
each family must produce enough to sustain itself.
Generally speaking, the crops that dominate intensive sub-
sistence agriculture are rice and other grains. Rice production 
predominates in those areas of Asia—South China, Southeast 
Asia, Bangladesh, and parts of India—where summer rainfall 
is abundant. In drier climates and places where the winters are 
too cold for rice production, other sorts of grains—among them 
wheat, barley, millet, sorghum, corn, and oats—are grown for 
subsistence. In both situations, the land is intensively used. 
In fact, it is not uncommon in milder climates for fields to be 
planted and harvested more than once a year, a practice known 
as double cropping.
▲ Figure 9.7 Gender division of labor in rice processing in Tamil Nadu, India Rice production is a major source of 
livelihood for both low-income men and women in India. Women thresh the rice while men look on from the rice bales they 
have delivered. Women also process, clean, select, and store the seeds for next year's crop, and are primarily responsible for 
preparing and cooking rice for household consumption and sometimes for market sale.
▶ Figure 9.8 Intensive subsistence agriculture Where usable agricultural 
land is at a premium, agriculturalists have developed ingenious methods for 
taking advantage of every square inch of usable terrain. Landscapes like this 
one—of a terraced rice field in Bali, Indonesia—can be extremely productive 
when carefully tended and can feed relatively large rural populations.

Pastoralism
Although not obviously a form of agricultural production, pas-
toralism is a form of subsistence activity associated with a tradi-
tional way of life and agricultural practice. Pastoralism involves 
the breeding and herding of animals to satisfy the human needs 
for food, shelter, and clothing. Usually practiced in the cold and/
or dry climates of savannas (grasslands), deserts, and steppes 
(lightly wooded, grassy plains), where subsistence agriculture is 
impracticable, pastoralism can be either sedentary (pastoralists 
live in settlements and herd animals in nearby pastures) or no-
madic (pastoralists travel with their herds over long distances, 
never settling in any one place for very long). Although forms 
of commercial pastoralism exist—the regularized herding of ani-
mals for profitable meat production, as among Basque Americans 
in the Great Basin and Range regions of Utah and Nevada and 
among the gauchos of the Argentinean grasslands—we are con-
cerned here with pastoralism as a subsistence activity.
Pastoralism is largely confined to parts of North Africa and 
the savannas of central and southern Africa, the Middle East, 
and central Asia. Pastoralists generally graze cattle, sheep, 
goats, and camels, although reindeer are herded in parts of 
Eurasia. The type of animal herded is related to the culture of 
the pastoralists, as well as the animals' adaptability to the re-
gional topography and foraging conditions (Figure 9.9).
Nomadism is a form of pastoralism that involves the sys-
tematic and continuous movement of groups of herders, their 
families, and the herds in search of forage. Most pastoralists 
practice transhumance, the movement of herds according to 
seasonal rhythms: warmer, lowland areas in the winter, and 
cooler, highland areas in the summer. In addition, women 
and children in pastoralist groups may be involved with cul-
tivation. They usually split off from the larger group and plant 
crops at fixed locations in the spring. However, the distin-
guishing characteristic of pastoralists is that they depend on 
animals, not crops, for their livelihood.
Pastoralism as a subsistence activity is on the decline as 
more and more pastoralists have become integrated into a 
global economy that requires more efficient and regularized 
forms of production. Pastoralists have also been forced off the 
land by competition from other land uses and the state's need 
to track citizens for taxation and military reasons.
Culture and Society in Agriculture
It is important to appreciate that these basic forms of food pro-
duction are predicated on cultural and social norms that are 
key to their success. In shifting cultivation, the division of 
tasks between men and women (and sometimes children) re-
sults from traditional practices and understandings of men's 
and women's roles in relationship to food, family, and resource 
use. Further, access to land is socially negotiated through well-
established customs and traditions.
▲ Figure 9.9 Global distribution of pastoralists and hunter-gatherers This map makes clear that pastoralism and hunting-gathering continue to be

Cultural practices are also key to access to nutrition 
because the general appropriateness of certain foodstuffs, 
food taboos, and food distribution are often determined by 
cultural norms related to age and gender as is land owner-
ship and the rules of inheritance. Also, a community's or-
ganization of access to fisheries and the use of forests are 
shaped by cultural perceptions and traditions. Finally, in-
digenous cultural knowledge of species and conservation 
techniques are important for the successful preservation 
of the complex of species that are needed to maintain the 
health and sustainability of the spaces of food resource use 
and production.
Pastoralism, shifting cultivation, and intensive subsis-
tence cultivation, are not simply subsistence activities but part 
of a social system as well. Pastoralist family groups are gov-
erned by a leader or chieftain. Groups are divided into units 
that follow different routes with the herds. The routes are 
well known; group members are intimately conversant with 
the landscape, watering places, and opportunities for contact 
with sedentary groups. The success of pastoralist activities to 
sustain the nutritional needs of the group depends not only on 
sophisticated cultural knowledge of the landscape, but also on 
a system of resource use that will sustain that environment for 
future needs.
Although declining throughout the world, the success of 
these ancient agricultural systems has been predicated on a com-
plex of cultural practices that have enabled small groups of pro-
ducers to harvest adequate amounts of food for survival. While 
these types of agriculture are certainly not sufficient to "feed 
the world," they do provide instruction and inspiration for a 
global agricultural system that is itself confronting profound ob-
stacles to its ability to provide adequate nutrition to the world's 
population.

AGRICULTURAL REVOLUTION AND 
INDUSTRIALIZATION
Geographers and others scholars view world agricultural prac-
tices as having proceeded through "revolutionary" phases, just 
as manufacturing did. And as in manufacturing, agricultural 
practices have not been transformed everywhere at the same 
time; consequently, some parts of the world are still largely 
unaffected by certain aspects of change. By seeing agriculture 
in this light, we can recognize that, as in manufacturing, geog-
raphy and society have changed as the global community has 
moved from predominantly subsistence to predominantly capi-
tal-intensive, commercial practices. This history has proceeded 
in alternating cycles: long periods of very gradual change punc-
tuated by short, explosive periods of radical change, resulting 
in three distinct revolutionary periods.
The First Agricultural Revolution
The first agricultural revolution is commonly recognized as 
having been founded on the development of seed agriculture 
and the use of the plow and draft animals (Figure 9.10).
Aspects of this transformation were discussed in Chapter 2.  
Seed agriculture, which emerged through the domestication of 
crops, such as wheat and rice, and animals, such as sheep and 
goats, replaced hunting and gathering as a way of living and 
sustaining life. Seed agriculture arose during roughly the same 
period in several regions around the world. The result was a 
broad belt of cultivated lands across southwest Asia, from 
Greece in the west into present-day Turkey and part of Iran 
in the east, as well as in parts of Central and South America, 
northern China, northeast India, and East Africa.
The domestication of plants and animals allowed for the 
rise of settled ways of life. Villages were built, creating types 
of social, cultural, economic, and political relationships that 
differed from those that dominated hunter-gatherer  societies. 
On the floodplains along the Tigris, Euphrates, and Nile 
rivers, important complex civilizations were built upon the 
fruits of the first agricultural revolution (Figure 9.11). Over 
time, the knowledge and skill underlying seed agriculture 
and the domestication of plants diffused outward from these 
original areas, having a revolutionary impact throughout  
the globe.
▼ Figure 9.10 Plowing with yoked oxen and camels, India In many parts 
of the world, agriculturalists rely on draft animals to prepare land for cultiva-
tion. Animals were an important element in the first agricultural revolution. 
By expanding the amount of energy applied to production, draft animals 
enabled humans to increase food supplies. Many contemporary traditional 
farmers view draft animals as their most valuable possessions.

The Second Agricultural Revolution
A great deal of debate exists as to the timing and location of the 
second agricultural revolution. Though most historians agree 
that it did not occur everywhere at the same time, they disagree 
over which elements were essential to the fundamental transfor-
mation of subsistence agriculture. Important elements included
■ dramatic improvements in outputs, such as crop and live-
stock yields;
■ innovations such as the improved yoke for oxen and the 
replacement of the ox with the horse; and
■ new inputs to agricultural production, such as fertilizers 
and field drainage systems.
The apex of the second agricultural revolution coincided 
historically and geographically with the Industrial Revolu-
tion in England and Western Europe. Although many impor-
tant changes in agriculture preceded the Industrial Revolution, 
none had more of an impact than the rise of an industrialized 
manufacturing sector.
On the eve of the Industrial Revolution—in the middle of 
the eighteenth century—in Western Europe and England, subsis-
tence peasant agriculture dominated, though partial integration 
into a market economy was underway. Many peasants were uti-
lizing a crop-rotation system that, in addition to the application 
of natural and semiprocessed fertilizers, improved soil produc-
tivity and led to increased crop and livestock yields. Addition-
ally, the feudal landholding system—a social and economic 
system based on peasant service to a lord in exchange for access 
to land—was breaking down and yielding to a new agrarian sys-
tem based on an emerging system of private-property relations. 
Communal lands were being replaced by enclosed, individually 
owned land or land worked independently by tenants or renters.
Such a situation was a logical response to the demands 
for food production that emerged from the dramatic social 
and economic changes accompanying the Industrial Revo-
lution. Perhaps most important of all these changes was the 
emergence—through the creation of an urban industrial work-
force—of a commercial market for food. Many innovations of 
the Industrial Revolution, such as improvements in transpor-
tation technology, had substantial impacts on agriculture. In-
novations applied directly to agricultural practices, such as the 
new types of horse-drawn farm machinery, improved control 
over—as well as the quantity of—yields.

agricultural revolution? How did manufacturing technologies

that affected both manufacturing and agricultural practices. What

The Third Agricultural Revolution
The third agricultural revolution is fairly recent; it began in the 
late nineteenth century and gained momentum throughout the 
twentieth century. Each of the third agricultural revolution's 
important developmental phases originated in North America. 
They include mechanization, chemical farming with synthetic 
fertilizers, and globally widespread food manufacturing. Mecha-
nization is the replacement of human farm labor with machines. 
Tractors, combines, reapers, pickers, and other forms of motor-
ized machines have, since the 1880s and 1890s, progressively re-
placed human and animal labor in the United States. In Europe, 
mechanization did not become widespread until after World 
War II. Figure 9.12 shows the global distribution of tractors as a 
measure of the mechanization of worldwide agriculture.

Nile River, Luxor, Egypt The lush fertile farm-
land in the foreground is enabled by the silt 
deposited by the Nile River. At a distance from

Chemical farming is the application of synthetic fertil-
izers to the soil and herbicides, fungicides, and pesticides to 
crops to enhance yields (Figure 9.13). Becoming widespread in 
the 1950s in the United States, chemical farming diffused to 
Europe in the 1960s and to peripheral regions of the world in 
the 1970s. The widespread application of synthetic fertilizers 
and their impact on the environment is what Rachel Carson 
wrote about in her highly influential book Silent Spring.

Food manufacturing also had its origins in late-nineteenth-
century North America. Food manufacturing adds economic 
value to agricultural products through a range of treatments—
processing, canning, refining, packing, packaging, and so on—
occurring off the farm and before the products reach the market 
(Figure 9.14). The first two phases of the third revolution affect 
inputs to the agricultural production process, whereas the final 
phase affects agricultural outputs. While the first two are re-
lated to the modernization of farming as an economic practice, 
the third involves a complication of the relationship of farms 
to firms in the manufacturing sector, which had increasingly 
expanded into the area of food early in the 1960s. These three 
developmental phases of the third agricultural revolution con-
stitute the industrialization of agriculture.
APPLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE
1. Locate a food manufacturing unit in any region of your country. 
Explain how it adds economic value to agricultural products.
2. Take a trip to your local grocery store or open up a kitchen cup-
board and read the labels on at least four different products. Iden-
tify the various processes involved in making each of the products 
ready for the market. What processing has occurred? Has refining 
or cooking been involved? What additional ingredients have been 
added to the product and why (to improve flavor, to extend shelf-
life, or for some other reason)? How does the packaging (con-
tainer, images of the product, colors of the labeling, etc.) enhance 
the attractiveness of the product?
The Industrialization of Agriculture
Advances in science and technology—including  mechanical 
as well as chemical and biological innovations—have 
driven the industrialization of agriculture over time. As 
with  industrialization more generally, the  industrialization 
of  agriculture unfolded as the capitalist economic sys-
tem  became more advanced and widespread. We regard 
 agricultural  industrialization as the process whereby the 
farm has moved from being the centerpiece of agricultural 
production to being one part of an integrated multilevel (or 
vertically organized) industrial process that includes produc-
tion, storage, processing, distribution, marketing, and retail-
ing. Experts in the study of agriculture see it as clearly linked 
to industry and the service sector, thus constituting a com-
plex agro- commodity production system.
Geographers have helped demonstrate the changes leading 
to the transformation of an agricultural product into an indus-
trial food product. This transformation has been accomplished 
not only through the indirect and/or direct altering of agri-
cultural outputs (such as tomatoes or wheat) but also through 
changes in rural economic activities. Agricultural industrial-
ization involves three important developments:
■ Changes in rural labor activities as machines replace and/
or enhance human labor
■ Introduction of innovative inputs—fertilizers and other 
agrochemicals, hybrid seeds, and biotechnologies—to sup-
plement, alter, or replace biological outputs
▲ Figure 9.13 Worldwide Growth in Fertilizer Use, 2005-2007 As the map indicates, fertilizer use has been growing in 
peripheral countries faster than in the core, though core countries are still the largest users of fertilizer. One of the biggest  
problems, and one that is only expected to grow, is increased runoff from fertilizer and resultant dead zones along ocean shores.

The Green Revolution and the Blue Revolution  
Recall that the industrialization of agriculture has not oc-
curred simultaneously throughout the globe. Changes in the 
global economic system affect different places in different 
ways as different states and social groups respond to and 
shape these changes. For example, the use of fertilizers and 
high-yielding seeds occurred much earlier in core-region 
agriculture than in the periphery, where many people still 
farm without them. In the late 1960s, however, core coun-
tries began exporting fertilizers and high-yielding seeds to 
regions of the periphery (largely in Asia and Mexico) in an 
attempt to boost agricultural production. In a development 
known as the Green Revolution, they also sent 
new machines and institutions, all designed to 
increase global agricultural productivity, as de-
scribed in Box 9.1, "Window on the World: The 
Green Revolution, Then and Now."
The Green Revolution was accompanied later 
on by a Blue Revolution, which affected world 
fisheries by introducing larger and more sophisti-
cated vessels into wild fisheries and expanded the 
capacities of aquaculture. Aquaculture is the grow-
ing of aquatic creatures in ponds on shore or in 
pens suspended in water. The Blue Revolution has 
shifted primary-sector activities toward a greater 
dependence on capitalized inputs—credit, machin-
ery, fuel, feeds, fertilizers, and pesticides—instead 
of human labor and nature productivity. One the 
one hand, the Blue and Green revolutions have in-
creased food production in many places, but on the 
other they have engendered conflict over how the 
new practices redistribute power over and access to 
food resources.
Economic crises, a decrease in government 
programs, and reduced trade barriers have slowed 
the progress of the Green and Blue revolutions in many coun-
tries. For example, fertilizer use in countries such as Brazil and 
Mexico has declined in the face of high prices, fewer subsidies, 
and increased competition from imported corn and wheat, es-
pecially from the United States.
Nontraditional agricultural exports
Many governments have shifted from giving top priority to 
self-sufficiency in basic grains to encouraging crops that are 
more competitive in international trade with a higher profit 
margin, such as fruit, vegetables, and flowers (Figure 9.15).

9.1 Window on the World
Te origin
In 1943, the Rockefeller Foundation provided funds to a group of U.S. agri-
cultural scientists to set up a research project in Mexico aimed at increasing 
that country's wheat production through expansion of irrigation infrastruc-
ture, modernization of management techniques, distribution of hybridized 
seeds, synthetic fertilizers, and pesticides. Within 7 years, scientists were 
able to distribute the first modified wheat seeds to Indian farmers. Known 
as the Green Revolution, the project was eventually expanded to include re-
search on maize as well. By 1967, Green Revolution scientists were exporting 
their work to other parts of the world and had added rice to their research 
agenda. Norman Borlaug, one of the founders of the Green Revolution, 
went on to win the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for promoting world peace 
through the elimination of hunger (Figure 9.A).
While the initial focus of the Green Revolution was on the development 
of seed varieties that would produce higher yields than those traditionally 
used in the target areas, eventually it came to constitute a package of inputs: 
new "miracle seeds," water, fertilizers, and pesticides. Farmers who use all of 
the inputs—and use them properly—can achieve the yields that scientists 
produced in their experimental plots, which are two to five times larger than 
those of traditional crops. In some countries, the resulting yields are high 
enough to enable export trade, generating important sources of foreign 
exchange. In addition, the creation of varieties that produce faster-maturing 
crops has allowed some farmers to plant two or more crops per year on the 
same land, increasing their individual production—and wealth—considerably.
Te eﬀects
Thanks to Green Revolution innovations, rice production in Asia grew 66 
percent between 1965 and 1985. India, for example, became largely self-
sufficient in rice and 
wheat. Worldwide, 
Green Revolution 
seeds and agricul-
tural techniques ac-
counted for almost 
90 percent of the in-
crease in world grain 
output in the 1960s 
and about 70 per-
cent in the 1970s. In 
the late 1980s and 
1990s, at least 80 per-
cent of the additional 
production of grains 
could be attributed 
to Green Revolution 
techniques. Thus, al-
though hunger and 
famine persist, many argue that they would be much worse if the Green 
Revolution had never occurred (Figures 9.B.1 and 9.B.2).
The Green Revolution has not been an unqualified success, however. 
One important reason is that wheat, rice, and maize are unsuitable crops 
in many global regions, and research on more suitable crops, such as sor-
ghum and millet, has lagged behind. In Africa, poor soils and lack of wa-
ter make progress more difficult to achieve. Another important factor is 
the vulnerability of the new seed strains to pest and disease infestation, 
often after only a couple of years of planting. Traditional varieties some-
times have a built-in resistance to the pests and diseases characteristic of 
an area but genetically engineered varieties often lack such resistance.
A social effect of the Green Revolution technology has been a decreased 
need for human labor. In southeastern Brazil, machines replaced farm work-
ers, creating significant unemployment. Green Revolution technology and 
training have also tended to exclude women, who play important roles in 
traditional food production. In addition, the new agricultural chemicals, es-
pecially pesticides, have contributed to ecosystem pollution and worker 
poisonings, and the more intensive use of irrigation has created salt buildup 
in soils (salinization) and water scarcity (Figure 9.C).

CHAPTER 9   Geographies of Food and Agriculture   339
Criticism of the model
Critics have argued that the Green Revolution has magnified social inequities 
by allowing wealth and power to accrue to a small number of agriculturalists 
while causing greater poverty and landlessness among poorer segments of the 
population. In Mexico, a black market developed in Green Revolution seeds, 
fertilizers, and pesticides. Poorer farmers, coerced into using them, accrued 
high debts that they could not even begin to repay. Many lost their lands and 
became migrant laborers or moved to the cities and joined the urban poor.
The new seed varieties sometimes produce grains that are less nutritious, 
less palatable, or less flavorful. The chemical fertilizers and pesticides that 
must be used are derived from fossil fuels—mainly oil—and are thus subject 
to the vagaries of world oil prices. Furthermore, the use of these chemicals, 
as well as monocropping practices, has produced environmental contami-
nation and soil erosion. Water developments have benefited some regions, 
but less well-endowed areas have experienced an exaggeration of already 
existing regional inequities. Worse, pressures to build water projects and to 
acquire foreign exchange to pay for importation of Green Revolution inputs 
have increased pressure on countries to grow even more crops for export, 
often at the expense of production for local consumption.
There are two final criticisms that have raised concern about the over-
all benefits of the Green Revolution. The first is that it has decreased the 
production of biomass fuels—wood, crop residues, and dung—traditionally 
used in many peripheral areas of the world. The second is that the Green 
Revolution has contributed to a worldwide loss of genetic diversity by re-
placing a wide range of local crops and varieties with a narrow range of high-
yielding varieties of a small number of crops. Planting single varieties over 
large areas (monocultures) has made agriculture more vulnerable to disease 
and pests (Figure 9.D).
In response to these criticisms scientists are developing plants that will 
increase production of biomass in the form of animal fodder and fuel resi-
dues, as well as of food, and that will give optimal yields when intertilled—a 
very common practice in Africa. In the Sahel, scientists are working on crops 
that mature more quickly to compensate for the serious drop in the average 
length of the rainy season the region has recently experienced.
Despite criticisms, it is clear the global agricultural system has grown 
spectacularly. And yet, the rapid growth in agricultural output that was the 
hallmark of the twentieth century has declined in the twenty-first century 
to the point where demand is vastly outstripping supply, driven not just by 
population growth but also by changing food preference among 
developing countries like China. With consumption outstripping 
supply, stockpiles of wheat, rice, soybeans, and grain are also be-
ing diminished, creating serious concern among policymakers. As 
shown in Chapter 4, climate change has been identified as one of 
the most harmful and least easily remediable factors behind lessen-
ing food supplies. Drought in California, Ukraine, and Australia, linked 
to climate change, has cut agricultural production in these places 
and raised the price of food. Thus, while the Green Revolution has 
come under much justified criticism over the years, its main objective 
of finding innovative new ways to feed the world's peoples must be 
respected. In the process, the world's agricultural system has been ex-
panded into hitherto very remote regions, and important knowledge 
has been gained about how to conduct science and how to under-
stand the role that science plays in improving agriculture.
The Borlaug hypothesis (named after Norman Borlaug), states 
that because global food demand is on the rise, restricting crop usage 
to traditional low-yield methods (such as organic farming) requires ei-
ther the world population to decrease or the further conversion of forest 
land into cropland. While there are signs that world population is beginning 
to decline, the Borlaug hypothesis—which is controversial—proposes that 
high-yield biotechnological techniques aimed at saving forest ecosystems 
from destruction are essential for saving the planet from ecological crisis. We 
discuss biotechnology and agriculture later in this chapter as well as the rela-
tive merits of sustainable organic agriculture and biotechnological commer-
cial agriculture in the Future Geography section.

▲ Figure 9.D Rice paddy, India The introduction of high-yielding, semi-
dwarf types of rice, starting in 1962 with the Green Revolution, emphasized the 
intensive use of fertilizers and pesticides. Rice production increased substan-
tially. However, this achievement was made at a cost to the environment where 
semiaquatic organisms, including wild fish, frogs, shrimps, clams, and snails, which 
have always been part of these ecosystems, have disappeared. Moreover, to 
keep soil salinity low, a large quantity of additional water is needed but is sel-
dom available resulting in soil degradation as well as species loss.

Nontraditional agricultural exports (NTAEs) such as these, 
contrast with traditional exports, such as sugar and coffee. 
NTAEs have become increasingly important in areas of Mexico, 
Central America, Colombia, and Chile, replacing grain produc-
tion and traditional exports, such as coffee and cotton. These 
new crops obtain high prices but also require heavy applica-
tions of pesticides and water to meet export-quality standards. 
They also require fast, refrigerated transport to market and are 
vulnerable to climatic variation and to the vagaries of the inter-
national market, including changing tastes for foods and health 
scares about pesticide or biological contamination.

Bourlaug say about the "anti-" movement? What do you think 
about her argument?
Contract Farming
One increasingly significant aspect of industrial agricultural 
transformation is contract farming. Contract farming is an 
agreement between farmers and processing and/or marketing 
firms for the production, supply, and purchase of agricultural 
products—from beef, cotton, and flowers to milk, poultry, and 
vegetables. The legal arrangement requires the firm to provide 
specified support through, for example, the supply of fertilizer 
or seeds and the provision of technical advice. The farmer is 
in turn obliged to produce a specific commodity in quantities 
and at quality standards determined by the firm. A great deal 
of agricultural production in the contemporary global system 
proceeds according to contracts.
Contract farming has been seen by some as a strategy for 
maintaining the livelihoods of small farmers marginalized by 
the growth of more corporate forms of farming. For farmers, 
contractual arrangements can provide access to services and 
credit as well as new technology. And the price offered for the 
product can help reduce risk and uncertainty. On the other 
hand, there are risks associated with the contract. The most 
worrisome is the indebtedness that often occurs when farmers 
are unable to meet the conditions of the contract or when firms 
fail to honor their agreements.
Biotechnology and Agriculture
In addition to the Green Revolution, agriculture has also un-
dergone a Biorevolution. The Biorevolution involves the ge-
netic engineering of plants and animals and has the potential 
to outstrip the productivity increases of the Green Revolution. 
Ever since the nineteenth century, when Austrian botanist 
Gregor Mendel identified hereditary traits in plants and French 
chemist Louis Pasteur explained fermentation, the manipula-
tion and management of biological organisms has been key to 
the development of agriculture.
Biotechnology
The central feature of the Biorevolution is biotechnology, 
which is any technique that uses living organisms (or parts 
of organisms) to improve, make, or modify plants and ani-
mals or to develop microorganisms for specific uses. Re-
combinant DNA techniques, tissue culture, cell fusion, 
enzyme and fermentation technology, and embryo transfer 
are some of the most talked-about aspects of biotechnology 
in agriculture.
A common argument for applying biotechnology to ag-
riculture is the belief that these techniques can help reduce 
agricultural production costs and serve as a kind of resource 
management (where certain natural resources are replaced by 
manufactured ones) practice. Biotechnology has been hailed as 
a way to address growing concern over the rising costs of cash-
crop production, surpluses and spoilage, environmental deg-
radation from chemical fertilizers and overuse, soil depletion, 
and related challenges now obstructing profitable agricultural 
production.
Genetically Modified Organisms A genetically modi-
fied organism, or GMO as it is more commonly known, is any 
organism that has had its DNA modified in a laboratory rather 
than through cross-pollination or other forms of evolution. Ex-
amples of GMOs include a bell pepper with DNA from a fish 
added to make it more drought-tolerant, a potato that releases 
its own pesticide, and a soybean that has been genetically engi-
neered to resist fungus.
Genetic modification has both critics and supporters. 
Proponents argue that it allows great advances in agriculture 
(e.g., plants that are more resistant to certain diseases or wa-
ter shortages), as well as other beneficial creations, such as 
the petroleum-eating bacteria that can help clean up oil spills. 
But opponents worry that genetically modified organisms may 
have unexpected and irreversible effects on human health and 
the environment and result in maturation problems in children 
or in mutant plant and animal species.
In the United States, genetic modification is permitted on 
the principle that there is no evidence yet that it is dangerous. 
GMO foods are fairly common in the United States and esti-
mates of their market saturation vary widely. It is not easy to 
identify GMOs in the grocery store, as there are no labeling re-
quirements (Figure 9.16). While the U.S. food-safety establish-
ment maintains that GMOs are safe until proven otherwise, 
countries in Europe have taken the opposite position: genetic 
modification has not been proven safe, so they will not accept 
genetically modified food from the United States or any other 
country. The World Trade Organization has determined that 

CHAPTER 9   Geographies of Food and Agriculture   341
not allowing GMO food into a country creates an unnecessary 
obstacle to international trade.
GMOs represent perhaps the most highly technological 
way to date in which nature and society come together in the 
global food system. At present, so little is known about the 
impacts of GMOs on human health, the environment, or even 
the wider global economic system that it is difficult to sort the 
costs of their increasing incorporation into global food produc-
tion from the benefits. What is clear is that genetic modifica-
tion is not just a passing fad and the debate cannot be reduced 
to a simple question of "good" versus "bad." GMOs are nei-
ther entirely good nor entirely evil; certain applications may be 
widely beneficial, while others may not. Regulatory structures 
are crucial to protecting human health and the environment, 
as well as spreading whatever benefits may accrue from GMOs 
beyond the core and into the periphery. But regulatory struc-
tures are not easily implemented.
Opposition to GMOs
Protests for the introduction of GMO regulatory structures have 
been most effective in Europe and parts of Asia, Africa, and 
Latin America as well as in Canada and Mexico. In these re-
gions, national governments are devising regulations to control 
or publicize the entry of GMO commodities into the food sys-
tem and are requiring more research to better understand the 
long-term effects of GMO consumption on humans as well as 
the impact of GMOs on the food chain. Widespread protests 
against GMO foods have also been organized in the United 
States, but the government has not responded with support for 
these movements. Congress has passed domestic legislation 
making the labeling of GMOs voluntary, and at the interna-
tional level the U.S. government has threatened action against 
countries who are arguing for the mandatory labeling of GMO 
foods traded in the global marketplace. It is important to be 
▲ Figure 9.16 Genetically modified food labeling laws While some countries such as the United 
States do not require GMO products to be labeled, there are only two countries that have official bans 
on genetically modified (or genetically eniginereed, GE) food. It's noteworthy that many countries have 
followed the US's lead in not having any bans whatsoever on GMO food.

aware that the position taken by the United States is pro-trade, 
rather than strictly pro-GMO. The U.S. government is mostly 
concerned with the economic impact GMO labeling is likely to 
have and is reluctant to put the trade of U.S. agricultural prod-
ucts at risk. This strategy is followed because the United States 
is the largest exporter of agricultural goods in the world as well 
as the largest producer of GMO foods.
Global debate and activism—both popular and govern-
mental—over GMOs is still in its early stages. Some of the most 
vocal opponents of GMOs are concerned that engineered food 
is destined for consumption by poor people in the periphery, 
while "real" food, produced by artisans and organic growers, 
will only be available to rich people in the core and little atten-
tion will be paid to the importance of reducing world hunger 
or access to a safe diet as a global human right.
Biopharming Indeed, biotechnology has provided impres-
sive responses to these and other challenges. One particularly 
spectacular aspect of biotechnology is biopharming, in which 
genes from other life forms (plant, animal, fungal, bacterial, or 
human) are inserted into host plants. In essence, this is bio-
engineering plants so that they produce pharmaceuticals. The 
resulting "pharma crops" are effectively genetically modified 
organisms that contain pharmaceuticals, antibodies, and in-
dustrial enzymes. The possibilities include pharma plants for 
treating diarrhea, heart disease, cancer, AIDS, and other ill-
nesses, and vaccines that would be administered by consum-
ing modified grain or fruit such as an apple that contains a flu 
vaccine. Pharma crops are still in the experimental stage and 
the research is highly confidential. It is estimated that there  
are over 400 pharma crops lowered currently at the experimental 
stage, with many of them being anonymously field tested. One 
of the expected benefits is lowered costs of medication, though 
it is too soon to tell how this decrease might work in practice.
Among the most controversial aspects of biopharming is 
how little knowledge there is about the effects of growing and 
ingesting pharma crops. Because pharma crops involve open-
air field-testing there is great concern about contamination. 
Formal responses to field-testing have emerged from scientific, 
agricultural, consumer protection, environmental, and food 
manufacturing groups. The concerns are related to:
■ the unavoidability of food contamination as drugs and 
industrial chemicals are transported into non-biopharm 
fields.
■ the health consequences to humans of biopharm crops.
■ the inevitability of wider environmental contamination for 
mammals, birds, and insects that feed on biopharm crops.
■ the financial liability to farmers and food manufacturers 
whose crops are contaminated without their knowledge.
One way to allay the concerns of scientists and other rel-
evant groups is to ban outdoor field trials. Other groups wish to 
ban biopharming all together. At the moment, there are a set of 
expanding protocols in place under the jurisdiction of the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture (USDA) that are minimal, requiring 
a wide border around the field as well as inspections.

The Adverse Effects of Biotechnology
While such technological innovations can seem miraculous, 
there is a downside to biotechnological solutions to agricultural 
problems. For example, cloned plants are more susceptible to 
disease than natural ones, probably because they have not de-
veloped tolerances. This susceptibility leads to an increasing 
need for chemical treatment. And while industry may reap eco-
nomic benefits from the development and wide use of tissue 
cultures, farmers may suffer because they lack the capital or the 
knowledge to participate in biotechnological applications.
Biotechnology has truly revolutionized traditional agri-
culture. Its proponents argue that it provides a new pathway 
to sustainable production. By streamlining the growth process 
with such innovations as tissue cultures, disease- and pest-
resistant and fertilizer-independent plants, optimists believe 
that the Biorevolution can maximize global agricultural pro-
duction to keep up with requirements of population and de-
mand. Moreover, the intensification of agriculture, which the 
Biorevolution (along with the Green and Blue revolutions) en-
ables, has reduced the risk that increased forest resources will 
be converted into agricultural land.
Just as with the Green Revolution, however, biotechnology 
may have ill effects on peripheral countries (and on poor labor-
ers and small farmers in core countries) (Figure 9.17). Table 9.1 
compares the impacts of the Biorevolution and the Green Revo-
lution on various aspects of global agricultural production. For 
example, biotechnology has enabled the development of plants 
that can be grown outside of their natural or currently most 
suitable environment. Yet location-specific cash crops are criti-
cal to economic stability for many peripheral nations—such as 
cotton in India, bananas in Central America and the Caribbean, 
sugar in Cuba, and coffee in Kenya, Colombia, and Ethiopia. 
These and other export crops are threatened by the develop-
ment of alternative sites of production or by multinational agri-
cultural corporations entering foreign markets. Transformations 
in agriculture have ripple effects throughout the world system.
A tragic story of the impact of foreign multinationals on 
domestic cash-crop producers' centers around the cotton farm-
ers in India. In 2011, the New York University School of Law 
Center for Human Rights and Global Justice released a report 
called Every Thirty Minutes: Farmer Suicides, Human Rights, 
and the Agrarian Crisis in India. The report states:
Economic reforms and the opening of Indian agriculture to 
the global market over the past two decades have increased 
costs, while reducing yields and profits for many farmers, 
to the point of great financial and emotional distress. As a 
result, smallholder farmers are often trapped in a cycle of  

CHAPTER 9   Geographies of Food and Agriculture   343
debt.  During a bad year, money from the sale of the cotton 
crop might not cover even the initial cost of the inputs, 
let alone suffice to pay the usurious interest on loans or 
provide adequate food or necessities for the family. The 
only way out might be to take on more loans and buy 
more inputs, which in turn can lead to even greater debt.
In fact, what many of these indebted farmers do out of 
sheer desperation is commit suicide. Over the last 20 years, a 
quarter of a million Indian farmers have committed suicide, 
making this the largest wave of recorded suicides in human his-
tory. The bottom line is that global agricultural transformations 
are far from benign and it will require an enormous amount of 
political cooperation to begin to address their profound effect.

GLOBAL CHANGE IN FOOD 
PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION
When geographers talk about the globalization of agriculture, 
they are referring to the incorporation of agriculture into the 
world economic system of capitalism. A useful way to think 
about the term globalized agriculture is to recognize that, as 
both an economic sector and a geographically distributed activ-
ity, modern agriculture is increasingly dependent on an econ-
omy and set of regulatory practices that are global in scope and 
organization.
Forces of Change
Several forces, institutions, and organizational forms play a 
role in the globalization of agriculture. Technology, econom-
ics, and politics have played a central role in propelling na-
tional and regional agricultural systems into becoming global 
in scope. One important way these forces of change have been 
harnessed is through new global institutions, especially trade 
and financial organizations. The result is an integrated, glob-
ally organized, agro-production system.
The globalization of agriculture has dramatically changed 
relationships among and within different agricultural produc-
tion systems. Important outcomes of these changed relation-
ships have been the elimination of some forms of agriculture 
and the erosion or alteration of some agricultural systems as 
they become integrated into the global economy. Two examples 
include the current decline of traditional agricultural practices, 
such as shifting cultivation, and the erosion of a national agri-
cultural system based on family farms (Figure 9.18).
Agriculture is one part of a complex and interrelated 
worldwide economic system. Important changes in the wider 
economy—whether technological, social, political, or otherwise—
affect all sectors, including agriculture. National problems in agri-
culture, such as production surpluses, soil erosion, and food price 
stability, affect other economic sectors globally, nationally, and 
locally in different ways. The same is true of global factors,such 
as the price and availability of oil and other petroleum products 
critical to commercialized agriculture, the stability of the dollar in 
the world currency market, and recession or inflation.
Because of the systemic impact of many problems, in-
tegration and coordination of the global economy is needed 
to anticipate or respond to them. In the last several decades, 
global and international coordination efforts among states 
have occurred. These include policies advanced by the World 
Trade Organization (WTO), as well as the formation of su-
pranational economic organizations such as the European 
Union (EU) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
(ASEAN).
National and International  
Agricultural Policy
For all countries, the production of food is thus critically im-
portant for sustaining its population and enabling the pro-
duction of food and other aspects of the economy to function 
and grow. Because food is also traded as a global 
commodity, international treaties, policies, agree-
ments, and markets have coalesced to regulate it. 
There are three key questions critical to under-
standing national and international agricultural 
policy: Why are there agricultural policies? What 
do these policies look like? What effects do they 
have?
Why Have Domestic and International 
Agricultural Policies? At the domestic level 
governments implement agricultural policies not 
only to assure adequate foodstuffs for their na-
tional population but also to support the smooth 
operation of agricultural product markets. This 
smooth operation most frequently involves a sup-
ply adequate to needs and demand, price stabil-
ity, product quality and selection and issues of 
labor and land use. These quite legitimate con-
cerns require governments to become involved in 
a range of policies including:
■ 
 education of a labor pool and research to sup-
port improvements in agricultural practices,
■ 
 adequate access to resources such as land and 
water,
■ 
 technological support for everything from 
business planning to risk management,

■ infrastructure to move agricultural goods including roads, 
ports, irrigation, and communication,
■ biosecurity to combat threatening pests and diseases, and
■ a trading environment that allows for national competi-
tiveness in a global market.
What Are Some Key Agricultural 
Policies?
In the United States, agricultural policy, as in other countries and 
regional government organizations like the EU, is complex reflect-
ing the change in agricultural practices over time as well as the 
growth of a global market for agricultural goods. Early agricultural 
policy tended to focus on developing the agricultural sector and 
supporting the stability and growth of farming as national eco-
nomic activity. In the United States, this early period was fol-
lowed by a dramatic economic crash—the Great Depression in 
1929-1945—that required more direct support for farmers in 
the form of income and price guarantees. These measured were 
meant to ensure that farmers remained in the agricultural sector 
and certain staple food were produced. Over time, other kinds of 
domestic policies become necessary including market and trading 
regulation.
It is at the international level that the growth in agricul-
tural policies has been the greatest, especially over the last 25 
years. At this level, multilateral trading systems are in place 
meant to govern import and export restrictions, promote food 
security and innovation, disseminate new technologies and 
growing and breeding techniques, and just generally increase 
agricultural productivity and profit.
What Are Some Important Impacts of 
National and International Policies?
The impacts of agricultural policy have not always been posi-
tive, despite their stated intent. Perhaps the most controver-
sial domestic policy in the United States has been the subsidy 
system, which though meant to support struggling farmers in 
the 1930s, now routinely goes to corporate farms. Subsidies 
have also been shown to promote overproduction and can 
end up costing taxpayers both higher taxes and higher food 
costs. The point is not that all domestic agricultural regula-
tion is problematic, but that it can have both positive and 
negative impacts.
At the international level, perhaps the most controversial 
regulatory body has been the World Trade Organization (WTO). 
A product of the rapid globalization of the 1990s, the WTO is a 
multilateral organization made up of 160 members (largely na-
tion-states) and 24 observer governments that constitute 94% of 
global trade and almost 97% global GDP. The WTO deals with 
all global trade, with agriculture being one of its most signifi-
cant areas. While most countries have laws meant to regulate 
trade outside of the national territory, the WTO's regulations 
supersede national ones for member nations and thereby make 
it one of the most powerful regulation and enforcement bodies 
on the planet.
With its aim to "ensure that trade flows as smoothly, pre-
dictably, and freely as possible," it has often generated signifi-
cant opposition, not just from small farmers and less powerful 
groups, but governments as powerful as the United States, the 
European Union, and Australia, just to name a few. Organiza-
tions such as Global Exchange argue that the WTO is funda-
mentally undemocratic and that it is deaf to labor and human 
rights in its push for creating a smooth surface for trade. 
 Further, they and others point out that the WTO is increasing 
world hunger because its leading principle, the Agreement 
on Agriculture, requires that market forces control agricul-
tural policies instead of national policies that aim to guarantee 
 domestic food security and the protection of farmers.
Opposition to Globalized Agriculture
These new forms of cooperation have other opponents as well. 
African activists have been involved in frequent and sustained 
protests against the involvement of European Union compa-
nies in biofuel farming there (which we describe in more detail 
in the material that follows). Similarly, Indian tribal women 
in the state of Orissa have been involved for several years in 
a campaign to prevent foreign and national companies from 
planting genetically modified (GM) crops. Exhibiting 500 in-
digenous rice varieties, these women argued before the state 
assembly in 2005 that the government would put at risk its rich 
array of rice species if genetically modified organisms entered 
the region. These and many other protests across the globe 
demonstrate that the global transformation of agriculture faces 
resistance.
Agricultural Subsidies
As mentioned earlier, one way that governments try to 
maintain the profitability of the agricultural sector while 
keeping food prices affordable is through direct and indi-
rect subsidies to agricultural producers (Figure 9.19). For 
example, the U.S. government subsidizes agriculture in a 
number of ways. One is by paying farmers not to grow cer-
tain crops that are expected to be in excess supply. Another 
is by buying up surplus supplies and guaranteeing a fixed 
price for them.
Billions of dollars are paid out each year in agricultural 
subsidies, the effects of which are complex and global in 
impact. Government efforts, while perhaps stabilizing agri-
cultural production in the short term, can lead to problems 
within the larger national and international agricultural sys-
tem. For instance, guaranteeing a fixed price for surplus food 
can act as a disincentive for producers to lower their pro-
duction, so the problem of overproduction continues. Once 
in possession of the surplus, governments must find ways to 
redistribute it. The U.S. government often sells or donates 
its surplus to foreign governments, where the "dumping" of 
cheap foodstuffs may undermine the local price structure 
for food and reduce economic incentives for local farmers 
to farm.
Many reasons exist for state intervention in agriculture. 
Governments routinely intervene in one economic sector or 

346 
HUMAN GEOGRAPHY   Places and Regions in Global Context
another, for instance, to correct wider problems of inflation or 
depression. For years, bread subsidies were the norm across 
the Middle East, used as a way of placating the population. In 
Tunisia in 2011, civil unrest was predicated in part on the high 
cost of food because national grain subsidies had not kept pace 
with soaring prices. It is important to keep in mind that the 
revolution in Tunisia is more than just about bread. Basic hu-
man rights are the most pressing demands across the Middle 
East from Tunisia to Yemen. When a government fails to pro-
vide those rights for the majority of its citizens, instead using 
handouts or subsidies as a substitute for democratic or eco-
nomic reforms, bread becomes a powerful symbol of all these 
citizens lack.
APPLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE
1. What are some reasons different groups would protest national 
agricultural policies? Think about how policies are set and the 
role of the WTO, and how GMOs might threaten indigenous seed 
varieties.
2. Research agricultural subsidies in your country. Which grow-
ers receive the most subsidies? Once you have established this 
fact, compare your national data with two other countries—
one from the periphery and one from the core. How much in 
government subsidies do farmers in other countries receive 
and how does it compare with subsidies in your country? What 
impacts might this have on the agriculture industry of your 
country?
The Organization of the  
Agro-Food System
Although the changes that have occurred in agriculture world-
wide are multifaceted, certain elements that serve as important 
indicators of change can help us understand them. Geographers 
and other scholars interested in contemporary agriculture have 
noted three prominent and interconnected forces that signal a 
dramatic departure from previous forms of agricultural prac-
tice: agribusiness, food chains, and integration of agriculture 
with the manufacturing, service, finance, and trade sectors.
Agribusiness
The concept of agribusiness has received a good deal of atten-
tion in the last three decades, and in the popular mind it has 
come to be associated with large corporations, such as ConAgra 
or Del Monte. Our definition of agribusiness departs from this 
conceptualization. Although multi- and transnational corpora-
tions (TNCs) are certainly involved in agribusiness, agribusi-
ness is a system rather than a kind of corporate entity. It is a 
set of economic and political relationships that organizes food 
production from the development of seeds to the retailing and 
consumption of the agricultural product. Defining agribusiness 
as a system does not mean that corporations are not critically 
important to the food production process. In the core econo-
mies, the transnational corporation is the dominant player, op-
erating at numerous strategically important stages of the food 
production process. TNCs have become dominant for a number

of reasons, but mostly because of their ability to negotiate the 
complexities of production and distribution in many geograph-
ical locations. That capability requires special knowledge of 
national, regional, and local regulations and pricing factors.
Food Supply Chain
The concept of a food supply chain (a special type of com-
modity chain; see Chapter 2) is a way to understand the orga-
nizational structure of agribusiness as a complex political and 
economic system of inputs, processing and manufacturing, and 
outputs. A food supply chain is composed of five central and 
connected sectors (inputs, production, processing, distribu-
tion, and consumption) with four contextual elements acting 
as external mediating forces (the state, international trade, the 
physical environment, and credit and finance). Figure 9.20 il-
lustrates these linkages and relationships, including how state 
farm policies shape inputs, prices, farm structure, and even the 
physical environment.
The food supply chain concept illustrates the network 
of connections among producers and consumers and regions 
and places. Consider for example, the linkages that connect 
cattle production in the Amazon and Mexico, the processing 
of canned beef along the United States-Mexico border, the

system that comprises distinctly separate and hierarchically organized sectors. Mediating forces (the state, the structure and 
processes of international trade, credit and finance arrangements, and the physical environment) influence how the system 
operates at all scales of social and geographical resolution.

availability of frozen hamburger patties in core grocery stores, 
and the construction of McDonald's restaurants in Moscow 
(Figure 9.21). Because of complex food chains such as this, it is 
now common to find that traditional agricultural practices in 
peripheral regions have been displaced by expensive, capital-
intensive practices.
That agriculture is not an independent or unique economic 
activity is not a particularly new realization. Beginning with the 
second agricultural revolution, agriculture began slowly but in-
exorably to be transformed by industrial practices. What is dif-
ferent about the current state of the food system is how farming 
has become just one stage of a complex and multidimensional 
economic process. This process is as much about distribution 
and marketing—key elements of the service sector—as it is 
about growing and processing agricultural products.
Food Regimes and Alternative Food 
Movements
A food regime is a specific set of links that exist between food 
production and consumption. Like the agricultural revolutions 
already described, food regimes emerge during key historical pe-
riods, when different cultural, political, and economic forces are 
in operation. In contrast to a food chain, which describes the net-
work within which specific food items are produced, manufac-
tured, and marketed, a food regime indicates the ways a particular 
type of food item is dominant during a specific time period.
Colonialism and Food Exports
Although hundreds of food chains may be in operation at 
any one time, agricultural researchers believe that only one 
food regime dominates each particular period. During the 
decades surrounding the turn of the nineteenth century, an 
independent system of nation-states emerged and coloniza-
tion expanded (see Chapters 2 and 10). At the same time, the 
industrialization of agriculture began. These two forces of po-
litical and economic change were critical to the fostering of the 
first food regime, in which colonies became important sources 
of exportable foodstuffs by supplying the industrializing Eu-
ropean states with cheap food in the form of wheat and meat. 
The expansion of the colonial agriculture sectors, however, 
created a crisis in production. The crisis stemmed from the 
higher cost efficiency of colonial food production, which un-
dercut the prices of domestically produced food, put domestic 
agricultural workers out of work, and forced members of the 
agricultural sector in Europe to improve cost efficiency. Indus-
trialized agriculture helped to drive down operating costs and 
restabilized the sector (reducing even more the need for farm 
workers). This movement toward the integration of agriculture 
and industry is also referred to as agro-industrialization.
Fresh Fruits and Vegetables
From the turn of the nineteenth century until the 1960s, the 
United States consolidated a wheat and livestock food regime 
that was epitomized in the meat-heavy diets of the typical 
American family meal. This food orientation can be explored 
through a wide range of sources from agricultural censuses to 
cookbooks, household expenditures on food, to restaurant and 
special event menus. Food researchers believe that presently, 
however, a fresh fruit and vegetable regime is dominant. The 
more perishable agro-commodities of fresh fruits and vegetables 
have become central to diets of people in the core. Integrated 
networks of food chains, using integrated networks of refrig-
eration systems, deliver fresh fruits and vegetables from all 
over the world to Europe, North America, and parts of South 
America, and several Asian countries (Figure 9.22). Echoing the 
former food networks that characterized nineteenth-century im-
perialism, peripheral production systems supply core consum-
ers with fresh, often exotic and off-season, produce. Consumers 
in the core regions have come to expect the full range of fruits 
and vegetables to be available year-round, and unusual and ex-
otic produce has become increasingly popular.
Alongside the emergence of a core-oriented 
food regime of fresh fruits and vegetables, it is im-
portant to note an additional aspect of food pro-
duction practices that has been taking hold in core 
regions and accelerating especially over the last ten 
years: sustainable agriculture. One goal of sustain-
ability in agriculture has been increased commit-
ment to organic crops—both proteins (beef, eggs, 
soy) and produce (fruits and vegetables). Organic 
farming describes farming or animal husbandry 
that occurs without the use of commercial fertil-
izers, synthetic pesticides, or growth hormones. It 
is important to point out that organic food produc-
tion is not the primary mode of practice, but rather 
that it has become a growing force alongside the 
dominant conventional farming (an approach that 
uses chemicals in the form of plant protectants 
and fertilizers and intensive, hormone-based prac-
tices to breed and raise animals) (Table 9.2). We 
discuss issues of food safety in more detail later in

TABLE 9.2 Conventional versus alternative food
Conventional
Alternative
Cheap food to most of the Western world, where the amount of money spent on 
food in the household budget has steadily decreased.
Logic of sustainable development, not mass production.
Quantity over quality where agriculture is part of consumption; food is a com-
modity like any other.
The idea of (real or idealized) "quality" predominates—expressed in such  
parameters as farmers' markets, CSAs, free-range, organic, GMO-free,  
integrated pest-management schemes, authenticity, traceability.
Fast, convenient foods: for nutritionists, the year 2000 was significant since it was 
the first time the number of overweight people matched the number of under-
nourished people—at 1.1 billion.
Slow, pleasurable food and consumers with an ethical consciousness; a new 
moral economy surfaces where issues of provenance take a central role and  
consumers demand knowledge of where their food comes from, whether it  
contains additives, and whether pesticides were used in production.
"Hard power"—retailer-led supply chains, emasculation of primary producers as 
supermarkets drive down costs to below that of even production.
"Soft power"—food sells itself through ethical persuasion and the new "moral 
economy."
Corporate capital, combined with science and technology enable large-scale 
food processing and a reliance on large retailers—at the expense of small,  
independent farms.
Social, as opposed to corporate capital. Direct farmer-to-consumer interaction, 
relational, trust-based, sense of "community," and attempts to restore small farm 
enterprises.
Food is "liberated" from nature; technological fixes predominate.
Food is relocated in specific ecological niches and the externalized costs of the 
conventional system—such as soil degradation, water pollution, animal welfare 
issues, and health care costs—are addressed.
Logic of deterritorialization—where geographies are a result of the intensification 
and stretching of the links and networks between production and consumption.
Logic of reterritorialization—where geographies are shaped by the resurgence 
of local and regional practices as central forces in new articulations of produc-
tion and consumption.
Geographic specialization, monoculture, and spatial homogenization in North 
America and Europe produce a large quantity of standardized products.
The "local" as a set of social networks and cultural contexts that are harnessed in 
place—which provide the foundation for development, innovation, and  
economic relations.
Placeless landscape of food production (United Kingdom, United States)  
versus place-based landscapes (France, Italy)—where region-specific foods are 
much more prevalent and provenance is understood as a selling point.
Transparent food chain, traceable, where producers attempt to regain power against 
the conventional price-driven "race to the bottom" and consumers' knowledge of 
provenance helps to produce local networks and promotion of social capital.

the chapter, but safety issues as well as overall health concerns 
and an evolving commitment to food as a gastronomic experi-
ence among mostly white, middle-class households is at the 
center of a number of alternative movements that are driving 
organically produced food as well as the local food and slow 
food movements.
Local Food
Local food is usually also organically grown and its designa-
tion as local means that it is produced within a fairly limited 
distance from where it is consumed, an area known as a food 
shed. Most understandings of local food set a 100-mile radius 
as a border. Thus, if one is a "locavore," the food one consumes 
should be produced on farms that are no further than 100 
miles from the point of distribution. The distance that food 
travels from the farm to the consumer is known as food miles  
(Figure 9.23). Local food movements have resulted in the pro-
liferation of communities of individuals who have joined 
together to support the growth of new farms within the lo-
cal food shed (the area within the 100-mile radius). These 
individuals have been behind a movement known as Com-
munity Supported Agriculture, or CSA. The CSA operates by 
collecting subscriptions and then paying a farmer up front to 
grow food locally for CSA members for a season or a speci-
fied time frame. The farmer then is able to purchase seeds, 
hire workers, cultivate produce and livestock, and deliver the 
harvest without relying on interest-bearing loans. The CSA 
members, in return for their investment in the farm, receive 
weekly shares of produce (and sometimes meats, eggs and 
cheese, flowers, and milk) that reflect the season and local 
growing conditions.
Thus, while a CSA in Tucson, Arizona, might receive 
verdolagas (a green that is native to the region) in addition 
to squash, snow peas, beets, and carrots, they are unlikely 
to ever receive pineapples or celery because neither can be 
grown naturally in the desert. CSA farmers are expected to 
grow their food organically and members accept what the 
farmers grow at the same time that they assume the financial 
risks that are part of the vagaries of any agricultural enter-
prise. CSA farms are usually small, independent, and labor-
intensive. The CSA movement is seen to be helping to restore 
the family farm to the national landscapes from which they 
have been disappearing for 30 years as more corporate forms 
of farming have taken hold. The CSA movement originated in 
Japan but it has spread to other core regions, including North 
America and Europe. In addition to the emergence of CSAs, it 
is also important to note that urban agriculture is also on the 
rise. Urban agriculture is the establishment or performance 
of agricultural practices in or near an urban or city-like set-
ting (see Box 9.2 "Visualizing Geography: The Growth of Ur-
ban Agriculture").
Although local food and CSAs, and organic 
and ecologically sustainable agricultural prac-
tices are movements that signal a shift in food 
production and consumption, they in no way are 
challenging the dominance of more convention-
ally produced, distributed, marketed, and con-
sumed food. Moreover, as a number of critics of 
the movements have pointed out, these alternative 
practices are largely organized and promoted by 
white, middle-class members of core regions and 
exclude, often simply through cost and associated 
accessibility, low-income people of color. The lat-
ter are denied these purportedly healthier eating 
opportunities because they lack the information, 
income, and proximity to access them. In core 
countries, the result is that low-income people 
turn to cheap, easily accessible food, also known 
as fast food.
Related to food security is the concept of food 
sovereignty, the right of peoples, communities, 
and countries to define their own agricultural, la-
bor, fishing, food, and land policies that are eco-
logically, socially, economically, and culturally 
appropriate to their unique circumstances.
Today in the United States, where food is 
abundant and overeating is a national prob-
lem, 10 percent of the population is undernour-
ished or experiences food-security problems at 
one time or another each year. In the periphery, 
where food availability is more limited than 
in core countries like the United States, under-
nutrition is far more pervasive. Furthermore, in 
▲ Figure 9.23 Food shed This combination photo and graphic shows how a food shed 
reflects the way that a local diet can be based on food raised and/or processed from within a 
100 mile radius. 

CHAPTER 9   Geographies of Food and Agriculture   351
some parts of the world, among some social classes, there are 
higher levels of undernutrition among women and girls than 
among men and boys. This is largely because different cul-
tural and social norms favor men and boys, who eat first and 
leave the leftovers for females, or who eat certain high-status 
foods, such as proteins like meat or fish, that women are not 
allowed to eat.
Food sovereignty is a movement that recognizes that mi-
nority populations in the core and periphery have had the 
least amount of control over the food they purchase and con-
sume. Local movements to achieve food sovereignty are usu-
ally organized by people of color, peasants, and low-income 
people who point out that access to healthy food is shaped by 
both class and by race. There are six basic principles of food 
sovereignty:
■ The importance of sufficient, healthy, and culturally ap-
propriate food for all
■ The significance of all food providers from farmers and 
pastoralists to cooks
■ The necessity of a close link between food providers and 
consumers
■ The requirement to control land as well as all the other 
inputs to food production
■ The centrality of local knowledge and skill to food 
production
■ The need for food production to support ecosystem bal-
ance and resilience
Related to food sovereignty is the concept of food justice, 
which is about enabling communities to enact the principles 
just mentioned, which is simply to be able to 
grow, eat, and sell healthy food and care for the 
well- being of the local ecosystem in culturally 
appropriate ways. It is also about ensuring that 
people who work in the food industry are treated 
fairly and have access to affordable and healthy 
food as well  (Figure 9.24).

Fast Food
Fast food was born in the United States as a product of the 
post-World War II economic boom and the social, politi-
cal, and cultural transformations that occurred in its wake. 
The concept of fast food—edibles that can be prepared and 
served very quickly in packaged form in a restaurant—actu-
ally preceded the name for it. What made fast food fast, was 
the adoption of industrial organizational principles applied to 
food preparation in the form of the Speedee Service System. 
The system, invented by Richard and Maurice McDonald in 
their San Bernardino, California, McDonald Brothers Burger 
Bar Drive-In in 1948, revolutionized the restaurant business. 
To preclude the labor and material costs of standard restau-
rant food preparation, each Burger Bar worker was assigned 
one task in an assembly-line operation—cooking the burger, 
placing it on the bun, or packaging it for take-away, for in-
stance—and the product was standardized so that the same 
condiments—ketchup, onions, mustard, and two pickles—
were added to each patty.
As Eric Schlosser wrote in his New York Times best-sell-
ing book Fast Food Nation, once Raymond Kroc came along in 
1954 and convinced the McDonald brothers to agree to fran-
chise—which involved the licensing of trademarks such as 
the golden arches and the adherence to established methods 
of doing business—the fast-food concept began to expand all

Most deﬁnitions of urban agriculture focus on the establishment or performance of agricultural practices in cities. Since the Industrial 
Revolution, many countries have discouraged urban agriculture as arable land has been used for real estate development or seriously 
degraded through industrial processes.
Urban residents across the globe are increasing their participation in growing crops and raising livestock, for reasons ranging from food 
security to income production to taste and health concerns. A recent publication by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United 
Nations has estimated that 800 million people are actively engaged in urban agriculture around the world.
9.1 Urban Agriculture Around the World
We usually think of agriculture as a rural activity, but urban agriculture made possible the emergence of the world's ﬁrst cities. 
Until recently, urban agriculture was largely ignored in the development of urban economic policies; it's produce was seen as 
part of the informal sector of the local economy and not signiﬁcant in terms of income-generating potential.

Figure 9.2.1 Projected food consumption per capita
Figure 9.3.1 Main types of urban farming and their beneﬁts
According to the latest UN projections, world 
population will rise from over 7 billion today to 
9.1 billion in 2050. Nearly all of the population 
growth will occur in developing regions like 
sub-Saharan Africa and East and South East 
Asia.
The demand for food is expected to continue to 
grow as a result both of population growth and 
rising incomes. Demand for cereals (for food 
and animal feed) is projected to reach some 3 
billion tons by 2050. Annual cereal production 
will have to grow by almost a billion tons, and 
meat production by about 200 million tons to 
reach a total of 470 million tons in 2050
Although urban agriculture is a growing movement in core countries, it is in the periphery where it more often is the sole means of 
economic and personal survival. As wage cuts, inﬂation, job loss, civil strife, and natural disasters become more frequent, urban 
agriculture in the periphery has become a way to address greater food insecurity.

over the United States, so that by 1951, Merriam-Webster's Dic-
tionary included it as a new word; and by 1964, there were 
657 McDonald franchises. In time, other enterprising individ-
uals seized the fast-food idea and opened hundreds of In-N-
Out Burger, Burger King, Chik-fil-A, and Subway restaurants  
(Figure 9.25).
Fast Food and its Health Effects
Health practitioners, alternative food activists, journalists, 
and others have turned a critical eye on fast food to expose 
some of its dietary, labor-related, and ecological shortcom-
ings. The concerns about the effects of fast food on health 
have risen as our consumption of (or, as some health experts 
would argue, addiction to) fast food increases and our levels 
of routine exercise decrease (Figure 9.26). Worries focus on the 
increased incidence of obesity (an amount of fatty body mass 
that is a danger to health) and diabetes (a disorder that affects 
the human body's use of food for energy), particularly among 
children.
Since the late 1970s, the rate of obesity and diabetes among 
U.S. children has doubled. Recent data shows that more than 
34 percent of children in North America, 38 percent in Europe, 
22 percent in the western Pacific, and 22 percent in southeast 
Asia are overweight or obese. These numbers, though certainly 
alarming, are not surprising given how heavily the fast-food in-
dustry advertises to children, a large percentage of whom can 
recognize the golden arches of McDonald's before they know 
their own name.
Diseases related to the increased consumption of fast food 
and many prepared, processed foods—energy-dense, nutrient-
poor foods with high levels of sugar and saturated fats—as 
well as reduced physical activity, have also led to adult obesity 
rates that have risen threefold or more since 1980 across North 
America, the United Kingdom, Eastern Europe, the Middle 
East, the Pacific Islands, Australasia, and China. Moreover, the 
obesity epidemic is often increasing faster in rapidly develop-
ing peripheral countries than in the core. The explanation for 
this epidemic reflects the impacts of economic growth, mod-
ernization, and globalization on daily nutritional practices.
The World Health Organization's assessment of the obesity 
and diabetes problem indicates that growing prosperity in the 
developing world is not entirely positive. Evidence suggests 
that as rural people move to cities and their incomes improve, 
their diets, previously high in complex carbohydrates, come to 
contain higher proportion of fats, saturated fats, and sugars. At 
the same time, urban life ordinarily means a move from highly 
demanding physical labor toward less physically demanding 
work and the increasing use of automated transport and tech-
nology in the home. These shifts have a significant effect on 
overall body fat as well.
Obesity is of concern to the international health commu-
nity because it poses a major risk for serious 
diet-related chronic diseases, including type 2 
diabetes, cardiovascular problems, hyperten-
sion and stroke, and certain forms of cancer. 
The consequences range from increased risk of 
premature death to grave chronic conditions 
that reduce the overall quality of life.

cious growth of fast-food production and distribution processes

is dramatically affecting Earth's resources, especially forests 
and farmland. It also has significant effects on hunger in the 
periphery (Figure 9.27).
The impacts of fast-food production and consumption on 
people and places are complex, from the convenience for busy 
consumers and the provision of play spaces for children to 
the elimination of forests and the debilitating health effects of 
overconsumption. How we manage these effects and address 
the causes have wide-ranging implications for people and the 
planet.

9.3 Spatial Inequality 
Food Deserts
A food desert is a geographic area where access to affordable and nutri-
tious food is highly limited, especially for individuals without automobiles. 
The term describes neighborhoods that have little or no retail food outlets, 
especially grocery stores that offer fresh produce and meats at reasonable 
cost.
Research on nutrition and geography has shown that food deserts 
are most likely to occur in low-income urban neighborhoods and rural 
areas where population density is much lower than in cities. It is generally 
agreed that food deserts are a result of land-use policies that have facili-
tated the tremendous growth of wealthy, white suburbs where large food 
retailers compete to serve this population. The same retailers are often 
reluctant to open up outlets in low-income neighborhoods because of 
a concern about lack of demand. In inner cities, low-income people have 
less to spend on nutritious food. In rural areas poverty will be compli-
cated by low numbers of consumers. As a result, typical inner-city and 
rural food retailers tend to be associated with gas stations and conve-
nience stores.
Distance from nutritional food retailers—as measured from a central 
point in a neighborhood to the nearest grocery store—is the main criterion 
for determining if a neighborhood qualifies as a food desert (Figure 9.E).  
For rural people, the calculation is 10 to 20 miles to the nearest supermar-
ket (Figure 9.F). For urban residents, the standard appropriate distance to 
a supermarket is one mile (Figure 9.G). A highly regarded 
study found that people of low socioeconomic status—
whether in urban or rural  areas—ultimately spend up to 
37 percent more on their food purchases, due to smaller 
weekly food budgets and poorly stocked neighborhood 
retail food outlets. A diet that relies on these types of re-
tailers consists largely of processed foods high in calories, 
sugars, salt, fat, and artificial ingredients.

THE ENVIRONMENT 
AND AGRICULTURAL 
INDUSTRIALIZATION
Agriculture always involves the interaction of biophysical and 
human systems. This relationship makes agriculture distinct 
from forms of economic activity that do not depend so directly 
on the environment. This relationship also necessitates that 
communities determine how best to manage the environment 
to facilitate the continued production of food. Because the re-
lationships between the human system of agriculture and the 
biophysical system of the environment are highly interactive, 
it is important to look at the ways they shape each other.
How the Environment Shapes Agriculture
Farmers have increasingly managed the environment over 
the course of the three agricultural revolutions. The current 
widespread use of fertilizers, irrigation systems, pesticides, 
herbicides, and industrial greenhouses even suggests that 
agriculture has become an economic practice that can ignore 
the limitations of the physical environment. Because agricul-
ture is an economic activity, its management of the environ-
ment in which it occurs becomes critical. As geographer Martin 
Parry writes:
Soil, terrain, water, weather, and pests can be modi-
fied and many of the activities through the farming 
year, such as tillage and spraying, are directed toward 
this. But these activities must be cost-effective; the 
benefits of growing a particular crop, or increasing 
its yield by fertilizing, must exceed the costs of do-
ing so. Often such practices are simply not economic, 
with the result that factors such as soil quality, terrain, 
and climate continue to affect agriculture by limiting 
the range of crops and animals that can profitably be 
farmed. In this way the physical environment still ef-
fectively limits the range of agricultural activities open 
to the farmer at each location.1
The effect of the environmentaon industrialized agricul-
tural practices may not at first seem obvious, but it is impor-
tant to appreciate that there are many. Examples include the 
availability of water, the quality of soil, air temperature, and 
length of the growing season, among other factors. Of course, 
on the other hand, there are also many readily observable con-
temporary and historical examples of the ways that agriculture 
destroys, depletes, or degrades the environmental resources on 
which its existence and profitability depend, as we discuss in 
the material that follows.
How Industrial Agriculture Affects the 
Environment
As mentioned previously, one of the earliest treatises on the 
impact of chemical pesticides on the environment was Ra-
chel Carson's Silent Spring, which identified the detrimental 
impacts of synthetic chemical pesticides—especially DDT—
on the health of human and animal populations (Figure 9.28). 
Although the publication of the book and the environmental 
awareness that it generated led to a ban on the use of many 
pesticides in most industrialized nations, chemical companies 
continued to produce and market these types of products in 
peripheral countries. Some of these pesticides, aimed at com-
bating malaria and other insect-borne diseases, are applied 
to crops that are sold in the markets of developed countries. 
Thus, a kind of "circle of poison" has been set into motion, en-
compassing the entire global agricultural system.
Among the most pressing issues facing agricultural pro-
ducers today are soil degradation and denudation, which 
are occurring at rates more than a thousand times the natu-
ral rates. Although we in the United States tend to dismiss 
soil problems, such as erosion, as an artifact of the 1930s' 
Dust Bowl, the effects of agriculture on worldwide soil re-
sources are dramatic, as Table 9.3 illustrates. Most forms of 
1/4 lb. of hamburger beef imported from Latin America 
requires the clearing of 6 sq. yd. of rain forest and the 
destruction of 165 lbs. of living matter, including 20 to 
30 different plant species, 100 insect species, and 
dozens of bird, mammal, and reptile species.
Cattle degrade the land by stripping vegetation and 
compacting the earth. Each 1 lb. of feedlot steak costs 
about 35 lbs. of eroded topsoil.
Nearly half of the total amount of water used annually in 
the United States goes to grow feed and provide drinking 
water for cattle and other livestock. Cattle also contribute to 
a signiﬁcant percentage of pollutants to U.S. 
rivers, lakes, streams and aquifers.
Grain-fed cattle are a signiﬁcant factor in the 
generation of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, the 
three major gasses responsible for global warming.
U.S. cattle production has caused a signiﬁcant loss of 
biodiversity on both public and private lands. More plant 
species in the United States have been eliminated or 
threatened by livestock grazing than by any other cause.

impact of beef production and consumption on the environment.

CHAPTER 9   Geographies of Food and Agriculture   359
agriculture tend to increase soil degradation. Although severe 
problems of soil degradation persist in the United States—
which has a federal agency devoted exclusively to managing 
soil conservation—more severe problems are occurring in  
peripheral countries.
The problem of soil degradation and loss is particularly 
critical in the humid tropical areas of the globe—especially in 
South America and Asia. Arguably the most critical hotspot with 
respect to soil and related environmental impacts is the moist 
Brazilian cerrado, or grassland, which is being converted to soy-
bean production to feed the growing biofuels industry (which we 
discuss in more detail in the next section). In addition to soil ero-
sion and degradation, the conversion of the cerrado is also threat-
ening the species richness of birds, fishes, reptiles, amphibians, 
and insects. Some local animal and plant species face extinction.
The quantity and quality of soil worldwide are important 
determining factors for the quantity and quality of food that 
can be produced (Figure 9.29). The loss of topsoil worldwide is 
a critical problem because topsoil is a fixed resource that can-
not be readily replaced. It takes, on average, 100 to 500 years 
to generate 10 millimeters (1/2 inch) of topsoil, and it is esti-
mated that nearly 50,000 million metric tons (55,000 million 
tons) of topsoil are lost each year to erosion.
The nature-society relationship previously 
discussed in Chapter 4 is very much at the heart of 
agricultural practices. Yet as agriculture has indus-
trialized, its impacts on the environment have mul-
tiplied and in some parts of the globe are at crisis 
stage. In some regions the agricultural system leads 
to overproduction of foodstuffs, but in others the 
quantity and quality of water and soil severely limit 
the ability of a region's people to feed themselves.
APPLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE
1. Select any agricultural region that makes use of chemicals in 
agriculture. Discuss the effects of this practice on the local 
environment.
2. Choose three common commercial crops (e.g., tea, coffee, cotton, 
citrus, rubber, potatoes, or peanuts) that are grown in your country. 
Identify the areas in the country where these three crops are grown 
and consult soil, temperature, and rainfall maps to learn what the 
local environmental conditions are that enable these crops to be 
grown in those areas. Next, identify what effect crop cultivation has 
on that same environment. Which of the crops has the most nega-
tive impact on the local environment? Which has the least?

managed pollinators are disappearing at alarming rates as a result pesticide 
poisoning, as well as habitat loss, diseases, and pests.

myriad challenges and possibilities facing food producers and

Food and Hunger

cultivated, processed, engineered, marketed, financed, and con-
sumed throughout the world. What we have yet to do is talk about 
access to this most essential of resources. Although there is more 
than enough food to feed all the people who inhabit Earth, access 
to food is uneven, and many millions of individuals in both the 
core and the periphery have had their lives shortened or harmed 
because war, poverty, or natural disaster has prevented them from 
securing adequate nutrition. In fact, hunger is very likely the most 
pressing problem facing the world today though the 
good news is that it has been dropping fairly steadily 
since the early 2000s.  These positive signs of hunger 
abatement mean the global community must con-
tinue their efforts toward a hunger-free world. (Figure 
9.30).
Nutrition Issues
Hunger can be chronic or acute. Chronic hunger 
is nutritional deprivation that occurs over a sus-
tained period of time: months or even years. Acute 
hunger is short-term and is often related to cata-
strophic events—personal or systemic. Chronic 
hunger, also known as undernutrition, is the in-
adequate intake of one or more nutrients and/or of 
calories. Undernutrition can occur in individuals 
of all ages, but its effects on children are dramatic, 
leading to stunted growth, inadequate brain devel-
opment, and a host of other serious physical ailments.
Globally, 24,000 people a day die from the complications 
brought about by undernutrition. Children are the most frequent 
victims. Children who are poorly nourished suffer up to 160 
days of illness each year, and poor nutrition plays a role in at 
least half of the 10.9 million child deaths each year. Moreover, 
undernutrition magnifies the effect of every disease, including 
measles and malaria. Malnutrition can also be caused by dis-
eases, such as the diseases that cause diarrhea, by reducing the 
body's ability to convert food into usable nutrients. Malnutri-
tion is the condition that develops when the body does not get 
the right amount of the vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients 
it needs to maintain healthy tissues and organ function. A per-
son with malnutrition can be either under- or overnourished.

Famine, Food Security and Food Safety
Perhaps the most widely publicized examples of acute hun-
ger are famines, especially those that have occurred in parts 
of the periphery over the last few decades. Famine is acute 
starvation associated with a sharp increase in mortality. The 
most widely publicized famines of the late twentieth century 
occurred in Bangladesh in 1974 and Ethiopia in 1984-1985. 
The causes of these two famines (and the other twentieth-
century famines that preceded them) were complex. The 
crisis of starving people so often publicized by the news me-
dia is usually just the final stage of a process that has been 
unfolding for a far longer period, sometimes years or even 
decades. Experts who study famine argue that there are at 
least two critical factors behind long-standing vulnerability 
to famine. The first has to do with a population's command 
over food resources in terms of their livelihood. The second 
has to do with a trigger mechanism, which may be a natural 
phenomenon, like drought, or a human-made situation, such 
as civil war.
People who study famine and other forms of hunger have 
come to conceptualize nutritional vulnerability in terms of the 
notion of food security. Food security for a person, a house-
hold, or even a country is assured access to enough food at all 
times to ensure active and healthy lives. And while famine is 
a dramatic reminder of the precarious nature of food security, 
it is important to appreciate that chronic hunger resulting from 
food insecurity is a far more widespread and devastating prob-
lem than famine, which tends to be shorter in duration and 
more contained geographically.
At the same time, hunger is a serious problem for periph-
eral populations worldwide (see Box 9.4 Geography Matters: 
Hunger and Poverty in the United States). For both core and 
peripheral populations, issues of food safety have also grown 
in significance. Over the last several years, "food scares'' 
caused by tainted foodstuffs have been routinely in the head-
lines: California spinach tainted with E. coli bacteria, salmo-
nella in canned tomatoes from Mexico and in hummus in the 
United Kingdom, toxic chemicals routinely added to pickled 
vegetables in China, E. coli tainted cucumbers in Germany, 
and potentially cancer-causing dioxins (which entered graz-
ing pastures through illegally dumped toxic waste) in buffalo 
milk used in the production of Italian mozzarella.
APPLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE
1. According to figures from Food First there is enough wheat, rice, 
and other grains produced to provide every human being on the 
planet with 3,500 calories a day. Given this, why are there more 
than 900 million hungry people on the planet?
2. Identify the communities and households that are most likely to 
experience food insecurity in your country? According to you, 
what may be the reasons for their food insecurity? 
The impact of food scares is widespread, affecting not only 
those who have become ill or died but also farmers and gro-
cers as well as the credibility of government agencies meant 
to protect consumers from tainted and toxic foods. Mostly, the 
recent apparent escalation in food scares reminds consumers 
of the vulnerability of the global food system.
Land Grabs
One of the factors thought to be adding to global hunger and 
food security issues is the increasing amount of cropland 
around the globe now being redirected to raising biofuels, re-
newable fuels derived from biological materials that can be re-
generated. The practice is known as a land grab—large-scale 
land acquisition in developing countries by domestic and for-
eign companies, governments, and individuals. Land grabs oc-
cur to enable both biofuel as well as food production.
Land grabs for biofuels are happening across Asia, Latin 
America, and Africa and often involve violence. For example, 
over the last several years in Tanzania, the government has 
handed over 9,000 hectares of land on which over 11,000 peo-
ple depend for their livelihoods to the U.K. firm Sun Biofuels 
PLC for a jatropha (a shrubby plant that produces seeds that 
are 40 percent oil) plantation (Figure 9.31). A recent report by 
the World Bank states that biofuel production has forced global 
food prices up by 75 percent. It is our view that the price of food 
is a complex variable affected by causes that include the emer-
gence and growth of biofuel production but is also related to 
rising demand among increasingly more affluent populations, 
commodities speculation, rapidly escalating energy prices, and 
poor harvests.
But it's not just for biofuels that land is being grabbed by 
investors from some of the world's poorest countries. Since 
2000, at least 31 million hectares (77 million acres) of land 
has been acquired by foreign investors who wish to improve 
their own food security back home. One way that research-
ers have been attempting to characterize the magnitude of 
the problem is to calculate how much food is being lost to 
the local population when crops are grown on land that may

9.4 Geography Maters
Hunger and Poverty in the United States
By Nik Heynen, University of Georgia
Perhaps you grew up hearing "clear your plate—there are children in the 
world who do not have enough to eat!" Now that you are older, do you 
ever think about this while eating dinner? Have there been times over 
the last year when you did not have enough money to feed yourself? 
According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), one 
in six residents in the United States (48.9 million people) battled against 
hunger in 2012.
As geographers, we can think about hunger in many different ways.
From a demographic perspective Chapter 3, we can see that nearly 
100 million people living in the United States existed on less than 185 
percent of the U.S. federal poverty level in 2012. Because of their low in-
come, these individuals qualified for almost all federal programs that pro-
vide food and nutrition to the hungry. Children in the United States often 
suffer the most, as a percentage of the population from hunger—and the 
United States has the most powerful economy on the planet. In 2012, ap-
proximately 16.3 million children in the United States (nearly a quarter of 
all U.S. children) were living in poverty and nearly 31 million U.S. children 
(42%) lived in households far enough below the poverty level to qualify 
for federal food programs.
As geographers we also try to understand the way these numbers map 
across the United States. Figure 9.H shows responses to the question "Have

twelve months when you did not have enough money to buy food that you or your family needed?"

there been times in the past twelve months when you did not have enough 
money to buy food that you or your family needed?" As this map illustrates, 
the state of Mississippi has the highest rate of hunger across the United 
States with almost a quarter of all households struggling against food hard-
ship. It also shows that the state with the lowest rate, North Dakota, still had 
one in ten households reporting food hardship.
Geographers also research how groups have organized against hunger 
and poverty within the United States. One example is how the Black Panther 
Party (BPP) contributed to feeding hungry children across the United States 
through their Free Breakfast Program for children (Figure 9.I). The BPP's first 
Free Breakfast Program for children was initiated at St. Augustine's Church 
in Oakland, California in September 1968, and by the end of 1969 the BPP 
set up kitchens in many other U.S. cities. At the breakfast program's peak, 
BPP members and other volunteers were feeding approximately 250,000 
children a day before they went to school across the country. The BPP's pro-
gram was also an impetus for the currently federally funded school break-
fast programs in existence within the United States today. California's school 
breakfast programs resulted from the pressure the BPP's breakfast program 
put on then-Governor Ronald Reagan. His administration eventually spear-
headed the implementation of the State's development of a school breakfast 
program.

CHAPTER 9   Geographies of Food and Agriculture   363
▲ Figure 9.I Black Panthers' Free Breakfast Program for children Black Panther Bill Whitfield provides free 
 breakfast to children in Kansas City in 1969.
As the history of the BPP demonstrates, there are many ways that orga-
nized citizens can contribute to combating poverty and hunger. Within this 
context, it is important to understand the larger structural issues that produce 
poverty and allow hunger to persist. If we really want to bring an end to hun-
ger in the United States, we have to tackle the uneven development of eco-
nomic opportunity and social power relations that allow inequality to persist. 
Foremost in this effort would be to think about the distribution of wealth and 
the unequal access to employment opportunities. Poverty and hunger could 
certainly be erased if more citizens worked toward these goals.
1. According to figures from Food First enough wheat, rice, and 
other grains are produced to provide every human being on the 
planet with 3,500 calories a day. Given these statistics, why are 
there more than 900 million hungry people on the planet (http://
foodfirst.org/)?

have been taken without their consent and is then exported. 
The study added up every known land grab larger than 200 
hectares between 2000 and 2013 and found that grabbed land 
could support 300-550 million people through industrial pro-
duction or 190-370 million people otherwise. The most chill-
ing aspect of the land grab phenomenon is that land is being 
taken in countries that already have extremely high levels of 
malnutrition. Couple this with the fact that there is often no 
national policy in place to prevent investors from exporting 
their crops and the situation is especially alarming and could 
become disastrous (Figure 9.32).
Addressing Hunger
While it is important to understand the compound causes and 
repercussions of hunger and undernutrition, perhaps the most 
relevant point to take away from this discussion is that it is a 
problem that can be solved. Neither short-term nor long-term 
hunger is due to inadequate supply, so the solution must lie in 
improving access to and distribution of supplies. This could 
occur, under a radical scenario, through a massive redistribu-
tion that would give all the people access to the same amount 
of food resources. Barring such a dramatic restructuring of the 
current economic system, the solution to the problem of hun-
ger lies in improving access to livelihoods that pay well enough 
that adequate nutrition becomes a human right and is not de-
pendent upon the vagaries of economic or natural systems.

There are many factors that will affect the future of global ag-
riculture, including climate change, adequate and safe water, 
and how to achieve a more just distribution of nutritious food. 
But an increasing chorus of scientists, policymakers, govern-
ments and farmers are moving to imagine a different future for 
farming that recognizes the strengths of both industrialized ag-
riculture and more sustainable, organic methods. Such a future 
would provide greater support than is currently available to or-
ganic farmers to improve their yields. As the study contends, 
in the future knowledge will be key to producing adequate and 
healthy food supplies:
Conventional farming requires knowledge of how to man-
age what farmers know as inputs—synthetic fertilizer, chemi-
cal pesticides, and the like—as well as fields laid out precisely 
via global positioning systems. Organic farmers, on the other 
hand, must learn to manage an entire ecosystem geared to pro-
ducing food—controlling pests through biological means, us-
ing the waste from animals to fertilize fields, and even growing 
one crop amidst another.
Better science and technological support to organic farmers 
will enable healthier soils, which will be critical to food produc-
tion in the face of climate change. But a global population that

will continue to increase through 2050 will require more food and 
conventional methods aided by Green Revolution techniques, 
biotechnology, and genetically modified crops (that are able to 
endure drought conditions) may also be critical to producing an 
adequate yield. The point is that a "one size fits all solution" is 
not a likely one. Instead a hybrid model will allow adaptation to 
different local conditions and build on the strengths—and hope-
fully mitigate the weaknesses—of all of them.
The future of the global food system is being shaped at this 
very moment in food science laboratories, in corporate board-
rooms, on the street in organized protests, and in settlements 
throughout the world. It seems poised to continue to produce 
vast quantities of grain, enough to feed the world. But feeding 
the world will also require the recognition that not all people 
have the resources to afford the increasing cost of food on the 
world market. Issues of redistribution of food also need to be 
confronted. Food revolutions such as biotechnology are likely 
to continue to expand, but the results of new approaches are 
not likely to be equally affordable across the socioeconomic 
spectrum. Therefore, social revolutions in how food is made 
accessible to all will also need to be considered.
APPLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE:
1. What are the new approaches to food production suggested by 
scientists, politicians, and farmers, working together?
2. What do you think the major differences are between conven-
tional farming and organic farming and how do you think they 
affect food supply? Think about the processes and technologies 
on the growing side, as well as the final products. Do an Internet 
search on food production near you—are there more organic or 
conventional farms? Are there any hybrid models? What do you 
think is the most effective way to feed our planet?
CONCLUSION
Agriculture has become a highly complex, globally integrated 
system. While traditional forms of agricultural practices, such 
as subsistence farming, continue to exist, they are overshad-
owed by the global industrialization of agriculture. This in-
dustrialization includes not only mechanization and chemical 
applications but also the linking of the agricultural sector to 
the manufacturing, service, and finance sectors of the econ-
omy. In addition, states have become important players in the 
regulation and support of agriculture at all levels, from the lo-
cal to the global.
The dramatic changes that have occurred in agriculture af-
fect different places and different social groups. Households 
in both the core and the periphery have strained to adjust to 
these changes, often disrupting existing patterns of authority 
and access to resources. Just as people have been affected by 
the transformations in global agriculture, so have the land, air, 
and water.
The geography of agriculture today is a far cry from 
what it was 100 or even 50 years ago. As the globalization 
of the economy has accelerated in the last few decades, so 
has the globalization of agriculture. The changes in global 
agriculture do not necessarily mean increased prosperity in 
the core, nor are the implications of these changes simple. 
For example, the production of oranges in Florida is directly 
influenced by the newer Brazilian orange industry. Both in-
dustries affect the prices of oranges in the marketplaces of 
Europe and Asia. Additionally, other forces, such as social 
reactions to genetically engineered foods, agricultural re-
search, trade concerns, and a host of other factors, have re-
percussions throughout the world food system.
LEARNING OUTCOMES REVISITED
■ Compare and contrast traditional agriculture practices across 
the globe.
Although traditional agricultural practices, including sub-
sistence farming, shifting cultivation, and pastoralism, no 
longer dominate agricultural practices on a global scale, 
they are still engaged in throughout the world, in some 
cases alongside more mechanized forms. Globalization, in 
addition to restructuring entire national farming systems, 
has also transformed farming households in the core, pe-
riphery, and semiperiphery. Thus, traditional forms of 
agriculture are waning as more and more places are irre-
sistibly drawn into a globalized economy supported by a 
strong commercial agricultural sector.
■ Describe the three revolutionary phases of agricultural develop-
ment, from the domestication of plants and animals to the latest 
developments in biotechnology and industrial innovation.
The three revolutionary phases have not occurred simul-
taneously throughout the globe, but have been adopted 
and adapted to differing degrees, based on levels of devel-
opment, culture, and physical geography. The first phase 
involved the domestication of seeds and animals. The 
second revolved around the improvement of outputs and 
innovations for making farming more efficient, such as an 
improved yoke for oxen. The third was based on inputs to 
production, such as fertilizers and field drainage systems.
■ Analyze the ways that the forces, institutions, and organiza-
tional forms of globalization have transformed agriculture.
Two of the most important forces behind agricultural trans-
formation are multinational and transnational corporations 
and states. Institutions like the World Trade Organization 
as well as regional associations like the European Union 
have also been important influences. And the organization 

366 
HUMAN GEOGRAPHY   Places and Regions in Global Context
of agriculture itself has experienced significant changes as it 
has moved from a family-oriented business model to a cor-
porate undertaking that stretches across national boundaries.
■ Examine the organization of the agro-commodity system from 
the farm to the retail outlet, including the different economic 
sectors and corporate forms.
The farm is no longer the central piece in the chain of agri-
cultural organization, but one of several important compo-
nents that include seed and fertilizer manufacturers, food 
processors, food distributors, and consumers. The organi-
zational structure of agriculture is composed of five central 
and connected sectors (inputs, production, processing, dis-
tribution, and consumption) with four contextual elements 
acting as external mediating forces (the state, international 
trade, the physical environment, and credit and finance).
■ Understand the ways that agriculture has transformed the 
environment, including soil erosion, desertification, deforesta-
tion, soil and water pollution, and plant and animal species 
degradation.
While most of the core countries have instituted legislation 
to address some of the environmental problems associ-
ated with agriculture, these problems exist throughout the 
global system to greater and lesser degrees. As agriculture 
has industrialized, its impacts on the environment have 
multiplied and spread so that some parts of the globe are 
at crisis stage. In some regions, the agricultural system has 
led to overproduction of foodstuffs, but in others the quan-
tity and quality of food production is severely limited by 
physical constraints and environmental degradation. The 
challenge of the twenty-first century is to work toward a 
more sustainable relationship between humans and the en-
vironment, especially with respect to food production.
■ Probe the current issues food-policy experts, national govern-
ments, consumers, and agriculturalists face with respect to 
the availability and quality of food as well as the alternative 
practices that are emerging to address some of these issues in 
a world where access to safe, healthy, and nutritious foodstuffs 
is unevenly distributed.
Genetic modification is one way of improving productivity, 
though it does not address issues of access to food. Oppor-
tunities for the world's poor—who are increasingly residing 
in urban settings—to grow their own food is another way. 
Still another way to improve food availability and quality 
is to recognize access to food as a human right and work to-
ward more even distribution. Other responses include pro-
moting more sustainable farming practices and supporting 
small farmers' efforts to produce efficiently and effectively.

REVIEW & DISCUSSION
1. Search the term "Green Revolution" on the Internet. From 
what you find, create a time line of the Green Revolution 
identifying its most significant milestones as well as the 
countries it has most greatly affected. Make a list of the 
pros and cons of the Green Revolution and decide where 
you stand with respect to the controversy and why.
2. Visit your local supermarket and identify seven different 
types of produce. Determine which company produced 
them and where and how they were grown. You may need 
to ask the produce manager where they come from but the 
tiny labels (with the PLU codes) will tell you whether they 
are commercially grown, organic, or GMO crops. Once you 
have determined the source of the produce, calculate how 
far it traveled (food miles) to reach your town.
 3. Explore further the impact of the environment on agricul-
ture by researching the projections that are being made 

CHAPTER 9   Geographies of Food and Agriculture   367
In this chapter we have looked at a central component of 
human-environmental interactions: the geography of food and 
agriculture, from the global to the household and individual 
level. In looking at this basic aspect of life—producing and con-
suming food—the issue of space, economy, and politics play a 
huge role as seen in the debates over the Green 
Revolution, the Biorevolution, food sovereignty, 
anti-GMO resistance movements and the con-
cept of "food deserts." To look closer at how and 
where we produce food, watch the story of Ron 
Finley, a "guerilla gardener" in South  Central Los 
Angeles and answer these questions.]

 2. Why is "food the problem, and food is the solution"?
 3. Where in the city does Finley plant his gardens?
 4. What is Los Angeles Green Grounds and how do they 
work?
 5. How is gardening like art? How does Finley talk about 
soil?

are children a vital component of this process?
 7. What does Finley say about flipping the script and making 
gardening "gangster"?
 8. Do an Internet search on "guerrilla gardeners." What other 
cities have guerrilla gardener groups? Does your city? 
Would you consider starting a guerilla garden?

about climate change and agricultural change. How will 
climate change affect the traditional areas of the globe 
where staples (e.g., rice, wheat, potatoes) are grown? How 
will it affect the areas where more popular fruits (e.g., 
oranges, apples, and wine grapes) are grown? Speculate on 
what you think the political and economic effects of the 
changing geography of global agriculture will be.

and not others? Have subsidies increased or decreased 
overall for the entire country? Which farm sectors, and 
therefore, which regions have most heavily benefited from 
agricultural subsidies? Why? Summarize and explain your 
findings.
2. The USDA also provides statistics on food and agricultural 
production, though, of course, data is limited to the United 
States. Contained in volumes called Agricultural Statis-
tics are a range of important variables, from what is being 
grown and where, to who is working on farms, and what 
kinds of subsidies the government is providing. Drawing 
on the USDA's Agricultural Statistics, examine the chang-
ing patterns of federal subsidies. Using a map of the United 
States, show which states have received subsidies from the 
1940s (immediately following the Great Depression) to the 
present day. Have subsidies increased for some parts of the 
country and not others? Have subsidies increased or de-
creased overall for the entire country? Which farm sectors 
and, therefore, which regions have most heavily benefited 
from federal agricultural subsidies? Why? Summarize and 
explain your findings.
 3. Odds are your usual breakfast is the result of the activities 
of a whole chain of producers, processors, distributors, and 
retailers whose interactions provide insights into both the 
globalization of food production and the industrialization 
of agriculture. Consider the various foods you consume in 
your typical breakfast and describe not only where (and 
by whom) they were produced (grown and processed) and 
how they were transported (by whom) from the process-
ing site but also where and by whom they were retailed. 
Summarize how the various components of your meal il-
lustrate both the globalization and the industrialization of 
agriculture.

Imagine what it would feel like if you had no nationality, no attach-
ment to a place through citizenship. How would your world change? At first, 
it would seem like a minor inconvenience. You could still buy your morning 
coffee, surf the Internet, hang out with friends. Before long, however, you'd 
come to realize that having citizenship status is your access to a whole set of 
rights. Without citizenship you'd live in an identity limbo unable to register 
for a new semester, get a job, drive legally, travel by air or open a checking 
 account, just to name the most obvious limits.
Nearly 12 million people around the world are stateless, lacking a legal attach-
ment to the country in which they dwell or to any other nation. For example, 
more than 100,000 Bedoon in Kuwait live without a nationality despite the fact 
that they constitute ten percent of the country's population. In Kuwait, the term 
Bedoon means "without a state." Some Bedoon were originally nomadic people 
who lived and prospered in the deserts for centuries but have since been settled 
into villages and cities. The government is concerned that such people don't le-
gally belong in Kuwait and should be returned to Iran or Saudi Arabia or else-
where. Whatever the case, Kuwait's Bedoon live there without any legal rights 
despite the fact that they made up over 80 percent of the Kuwaiti Army during 
the 1990s, the period in which Kuwait was at war with Iraq.
The 1954 UN Convention defines statelessness as "a person who is not 
 considered a national by any state under the operation of its laws." Unfortu-
nately, few signatories to the convention ever formulated policies to enable 
stateless people within their territories to establish legal nationality. This lack 
of legislative action—mostly deliberate—leaves millions without rights.
Other stateless populations include the four million Palestinians living in Is-
rael and the Occupied Territories (discussed in more detail later in this chapter) 
who technically have no citizenship. There are 90,000 Saharawis, inhabit-
ants of Western Sahara, who live as exiles in Algeria, where they have no le-
gal status. Kurds are another widely known as a population that lacks their 
own state, though their case is an encouraging one as it seems that Kurdistan,  
"the land of the Kurds" a geo-cultural region where Kurdish people form a 
prominent minority, will be able to establish an independent nation state in the

undoubtedly had much to do with the widespread influence 
of Charles Darwin on intellectual and social life. His theory of 
competition inspired political geographers to conceptualize 
the state as a kind of biological organism that grew and con-
tracted in response to external factors and forces. It was also 
during the late nineteenth century that foreign policy as a focus 
of state activity began to be studied. This new field came to be 
called geopolitics.
The Geopolitical Model of the State
Geopolitics is the state's power to control space or territory and 
shape international political relations. Within the discipline 
of geography, geopolitical theory originated with Friedrich 
Ratzel (1844-1904). Ratzel was greatly influenced by the theo-
ries embodied in social Darwinism that emerged in the mid-
nineteenth century. His model portrays the state as behaving 
like a biological organism, with its growth and change seen as  
natural and inevitable. Ratzel's views continue to influence 
theorizing about the state today through the conviction that 
geopolitics stems from the interactions of power and territory.
Although it has evolved since Ratzel first introduced the 
concept, geopolitical theory has become one of the corner-
stones of contemporary political geography and state foreign 
policy more generally. And, although the organic view of the 
state has been abandoned, the twin features of power and terri-
tory still lie at the heart of political geography.
Figure 10.1 illustrates Ratzel's conceptualization of the 
interaction of power and territory through the changing face 
of Europe from the end of World War I to the present. The 
transformations in the maps reflect the unstable relationship 
between power and territory, especially some states' failure 
to achieve stability. The most recent map of Europe portrays 
the precarious nation-state boundaries in the post-Cold War 
period. Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have regained their sov-
ereign status. Czechoslovakia has dissolved into Czechia and 
Slovakia. Yugoslavia has dissolved into seven states, but not 
without much civil strife and loss of life. The former Soviet 
Union is now the Commonwealth of Independent States, with 
Russia the largest and most powerful. And still the map is not 
fully settled.
The tensions within the former Soviet Union, for instance, 
are especially high as new republics such as Ukraine voted to 
move politically closer to Europe and the United States and 
further away from Russia. But in February of 2014, a series of 
violent events consolidated into the "Ukrainian Revolution" 
and resulted in Ukraine's then president fleeing the country for 
Russia. Soon after the revolution, Russia invaded and seized 
control of the Crimean Peninsula and has declared it part of the 
Russian territory (Figure 10.2). Thus the map of Europe contin-
ues to shift even today.
Boundaries and Frontiers
Boundaries enable territoriality to be defined and enforced and 
allow conflict and competition to be managed and channeled. 
The creation of boundaries is, therefore, an important element 
near future. The Roma are a European stateless popula-
tion of between roughly 70,000-80,000 who live or have 
lived in Czechia, Yugoslavia,  Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
Montenegro, Serbia, Slovenia,  Macedonia, and Italy. 
They originated in  India and were brought by Muslims 
as slaves between the 6th and 11th centuries. As people 
without citizenship, the Roma (also known pejoratively 
as Gypsies) are discriminated against with the average 
Roma far behind a European counterpart on social indi-
cators like level of education and quality of employment 
and housing. The life expectancy of the Roma people is 
ten years lower than European Union citizens.
One thing that countries can do to improve the lives 
of the millions of stateless people globally is establish 
laws that provide a pathway to citizenship or recog-
nize the appeal for independence by those people who 
occupy their own territory such as the Kurds and the 
 Palestinians. In 2013, the United Kingdom passed a law 
that would allow stateless people within its borders to 
become citizens. Yet in Kuwait, the fate of the Bedoon 
still remains uncertain, despite years of agitation and 
a parliament that, though it passed an act in 2012 that 
would allow the naturalization of 4,000 stateless peo-
ple, has still not enforced it.
THE DEVELOPMENT OF POLITICAL 
GEOGRAPHY
This chapter explores how new maps and geopolitical arrange-
ments continue to emerge around the globe at the same time that 
established boundaries persist. Exploration, imperialism, coloni-
zation, decolonization, and the Cold War between East and West 
are powerful forces that have created and transformed national 
boundaries. Much of the political strife that currently grips the 
globe involves local or regional responses to the impacts of glo-
balization of the economy. Political geography is not just about 
global or international relationships. It is also about the many 
other geographic and political divisions that stretch from the 
globe to the neighborhood and to the individual body.
Political geography is a long-established subfield of geog-
raphy. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle is often con-
sidered the first political geographer. His model of the state is 
based upon factors such as climate, terrain, and the relation-
ship between population and territory. Other important politi-
cal geographers have, over the years, promoted theories of the 
state that incorporate elements of the landscape and the physi-
cal environment as well as the population characteristics of 
regions. They believed that states consolidated and fragmented 
based on complex relationships among and between factors 
such as population size and composition, agricultural produc-
tivity, land area, and the role of the city.
The factors were deemed important to state growth 
and change. Why these factors were identified as central 

CHAPTER 10   Political Geographies   371
zoning boundaries can regulate access to upscale neighbor-
hoods; field boundaries can regulate access to pasture, and so 
on (Figure 10.3).
One aspect of boundaries that is of increasing interest to 
geographers is how they are organized and policed. Since 9/11, 
for example, the relevance of policing national borders with 
respect to international travel has grown dramatically. States 
across the world, led by front-runners like Israel, the United 
Kingdom, and the United States, have been instituting a wide 
range of practices to secure borders by electronic screening. By 
way of passports that contain RFID (radio frequency identifica-
tion) chips, as well as retinal scanning and related biometrics 
(electronic technologies for recognizing an individual based on 
one or more physical or behavioral elements), state agencies 
are increasingly able to know more and more personal informa-
tion about travelers. These practices have the effect of creating 
virtual (technologically generated) boundaries that fortify the 
territorial ones.
Once established, boundaries tend to reinforce spatial 
exclusion as well as differentiation. The outcomes result 
in making political territories. Boundaries are normally inclu-
sionary. That is, they are constructed to regulate and control 
specific sets of people and resources within them. Encom-
passed within a clearly defined territory, all sorts of activity 
can be controlled and regulated—from birth to death. The 
delimited area—which may include both land and water, and 
even airspace—over which a state exercises control and which 
is recognized by other states is territory. The space over which 
a state rules should not be confused with a non-sovereign geo-
graphic unit that possesses rights and protections through its 
relationship with a state. This entity is identified by the word 
territory as well. For instance, Guam, Puerto Rico and Samoa, 
are territories of the United States. The rules by which territo-
ries are able to participate in the government of their respective 
states differ from one state to another.
Boundaries can also be exclusionary. They are designed 
to control people and resources outside them. National 
boundaries, for example, can control the flow of immigrants 
or imported goods. Municipal boundaries may separate dif-
ferent tax structures or even access to alcohol; land-use

Boundaries can be established in many ways and 
with differing degrees of permeability. At one extreme are 
informal, implied boundaries that are set by markers and 
symbols but never delineated on maps or in legal docu-
ments. Good examples are the "turf" of a city gang, the 
 "territory" of an organized crime "family," or the range of 
a pastoral tribe. At the other extreme are formal boundaries  
partly from different sets of rules, both formal and informal, 
that apply within different territories, and partly because 
boundaries often restrict contact between people and foster 
the development of stereotypes about "others." This restricted 
contact, in turn, reinforces the role of boundaries in regulat-
ing and controlling conflict and competition between territo-
rial groups.

states of the European Union, for example, 
have become quite permeable, and people 
and goods from member states can now 
move freely between them with no customs 
or passport controls.

1. Why are boundaries an important concept 
in geopolitics? What are some issues that 
develop from the inclusionary aspect of 
borders? What are some issues that can result 
from the exclusionary aspect of borders?
2. Explore how boundaries are formed at 
different geographical scales, for example, 
at the local, regional, national, and global 
levels. Give specific examples drawn from 
your own country to explain the infor-
mal and formal processes of boundary 
formation. 
Frontier Regions Frontier regions 
occur where boundaries are very weakly 
developed. They involve zones of under-
developed territoriality, areas that are 
distinctive for their marginality rather 
than for their belonging. In the nine-
teenth century, vast frontier regions still 
existed—major geographic realms that 
had not yet been conquered, explored, 
and settled (such as Australia, the 
American West, the Canadian North,  
and sub-Saharan Africa). All of these are 
now largely settled, with boundaries set 
at a range of jurisdictional levels from 
individual land ownership to local and 
national governmental borders (Figure 
10.5). Only Antarctica, virtually absent of 
permanent human settlement, exists today 
as a frontier region in this strict sense of 
the term (see Box 10.1 Geography Matters: 
 Politics at the Poles).
There remain, nevertheless, many regions that are still 
somewhat marginal in that they have not been fully settled 
or do not have a recognized economic potential, even though 
their national political boundaries and sovereignty are clear-
cut. Such regions—the Sahara Desert, for example—often 
span national boundaries simply because they are inhospi-
table, inaccessible, and (at the moment) economically unim-
portant. Political boundaries are drawn through them because 
they represent the line of least resistance for the nations 
involved. Of course, these frontier are most contentions at the 
local level. An example is the boundary between wealthy and 
poorer sections of a city or town where a train track or a river 
may divide them.

against the movement not only of people but also of goods,

ary is the ones between the United States and Mexico 
and the United States and Canada (Figure 10.4a & 10.4b).

though, provides the ultimate example: a cartographic freak, 
restricted by the Andes to a very long and relatively thin strip 
along the Pacific coast. Examples of countries with boundar-
ies formed by rivers include China and North Korea (the Yalu 
and Tumen), Laos and Thailand (the Mekong), and Zambia 
and Zimbabwe (the Zambezi). Similarly, major lakes divide 
Canada and the eastern United States (along the Great Lakes), 
France and Switzerland (Lake Geneva), and Kenya and Uganda  
(Lake Victoria).
Where no natural features occur, formal boundaries tend 
to be fixed along the easiest and most practical cartographic 
device: a straight line. Examples include the boundaries among 
Egypt, Sudan, and Libya, between Syria and Iraq, and between 
the western United States and Canada. Straight-line boundar-
ies are also characteristic of formal boundaries established 
through colonization, which is the outcome of a particular

form of territoriality. The reason, once again, is prac-
ticality. Straight lines are easy to survey and even 
easier to delimit on maps of territory that remain to 
be fully charted, claimed, and settled. Straight-line 
boundaries were established, for example, in many 
parts of Africa during European colonization in the 
nineteenth century.
In detail, however, formal boundaries often 
detour from straight lines and natural barriers to 
accommodate special needs and claims. Colombia's 
border, for instance, was established to contain the 
source of the Orinoco River; the Democratic Republic 
of Congo's border was established to provide a corri-
dor of access to the Atlantic Ocean (Figure 10.6).
Territories delimited by formal boundaries—
national states, states, counties, municipalities, spe-
cial districts, and so on—are known as de jure spaces 
or regions. De jure means "legally recognized." His-
torically, the word referred to a loose patchwork of 
territories (with few formally defined or delimited 
boundaries). More recently it has evolved to describe 
nested hierarchies (Figure 10.7) and overlapping sys-
tems of legally recognized territories.
▲ Figure 10.6 Democratic Republic of Congo's access to 
the sea Ocean access is a key need of states as it allows them to 
send and receive goods by way of contemporary container tech-
nologies, among other things.
▼ Figure 10.7  Nested hierarchy of de jure territories De jure territories 
are constructed at various spatial scales. Administrative and governmental 
 territories are often "nested," with one set of territories fitting within the larger 
framework of another, as in this example of region, department, arrondisse-
ment, canton, and commune in France.

10.1   Geography Matters
The Land-Ocean Divide
Look at any world map and what do you see? A series of state territories de-
fined by boundary lines. If you take a closer look, though, you'll notice that 
these territories cover only 30% of the world's surface. The other 70%—the 
portion covered by salt water—is beyond the territory of any individual 
state. According to the political geography that underpins international law, 
land can be developed and policed, and therefore may be claimed by indi-
vidual states. Water is different. It can't be adequately developed or policed 
by any single state; it is designated as a global commons where ships of any 
state can navigate freely.
What happens, though, when water is frozen, and takes on some of 
the properties of land? What happens when land is frozen and becomes 
somewhat more like the ocean?
Antarctica: Politics on Frozen Land
Antarctica is a continent with no indigenous inhabitants. It is almost impos-
sible to reach for long portions of the year due to weather conditions; 
 agriculture is out of the question; no military could police its vast distances; 
and if resource extraction were ever attempted it would prove exception-
ally challenging. Antarctica is probably more remote and hostile to human 
habitation than most of the ocean. Nonetheless, when national governments 
began to recognize that there was a mass of land beneath the Antarctic ice 
cap, they sent scientists and explorers to claim it (Figure 10.A).
By the middle of the twentieth century, Antarctica was beginning to 
emerge as a site of geopolitical competition. Recognizing that the impact 
of an all out war for Antarctica could be catastrophic while the benefits 
of "winning" the war would be few, treaty negotiations commenced.

CHAPTER 10   Political Geographies   377
Negotiators quickly came to terms with the fact that although Antarctica 
was land and thus hypothetically parts of it could be claimed by individual 
states, the continent as a whole was well suited for a collective governance 
system. That collective governance put a limit on individual claims so 
that all states could continue nonexclusive use, much like the governance 
system that prevails in the ocean. The resulting Antarctic Treaty of 1961 
established Antarctica as a scientific preserve where military activities are 
banned and the rights of scientists from all nations are guaranteed. 
The Arctic: Politics on Frozen Ocean
The situation in the Arctic is the opposite of Antarctica. Whereas Antarctica 
is a frozen, uninhabited continent surrounded by water, the Arctic is a frozen  
ocean surrounded by inhabited land (Figure 10.B). If this situation existed 
anywhere else in the world, the central ocean would be governed just like 
any other ocean, under the rules of the UN Convention on the Law of the 
Sea, which are designed to preserve access by the community of states. 
Meanwhile, the inhabited areas of land around the ocean's edges would fall 
within the sovereign territory of each bordering state.
Things are not so simple, however. Although the Arctic is an ocean sur-
rounded by land, that ocean and land are frozen for much of the year. And 
for the indigenous inhabitants of the area as well as other people living in 
the region, this makes a world of difference. 
Indigenous peoples in the Arctic make their homes on both land and 
water. Their "home" is not the territory of one of the five states with Arctic 
land (Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia, and the United States). Rather, it is 
a complex, continually freezing and thawing mosaic of land, water, and ice 
that cannot be represented by a typical Western map that defines land as 
territory and water as beyond territory's limits. 
The largest political grouping of northern indigenous people, the 
Inuit Circumpolar Council (ICC), recognizes this disjuncture between 
the geography of the world map and the geography of their own lives.  
The ICC acknowledges the sovereignty of the five states that control 
pieces of Arctic land. However, it maintains that these states' sovereignty 
should legally recognize that the home-space of the Inuit includes ice, 
water, and land that exist across and outside—as well as within—the 
borders of individual states. For the ICC, the Arctic presents a new political 
geography that requires a new kind of map.
1. The modern state system emerged in temperate Europe, where 
there is a clear distinction between land (where everyday activi-
ties occur) and water (which is understood as hostile to human 
habitation). What might the world map have looked like if instead 
it had emerged in the Arctic where frozen conditions complicate 
this distinction between land and water?
 
2. The Inuit Circumpolar Council calls for a new notion of sov-
ereignty that recognizes the ways in which livelihoods cross 
between land and water. How might this notion be taken up by 
low-lying island states whose land territory is threatened by sea-
level rise?
 
3. What other spaces could be peacefully governed by a treaty 
modelled after the Antarctic Treaty?

of their places of origin and their lack of their own state. The 
term nation-state refers to an ideal form consisting of a homo-
geneous group of people governed by their own state. In a true 
nation-state, no significant group exists that is not part of the 
nation. and no significant portion of the nation is left outside 
of its territorial boundaries. Sovereignty is the exercise of state 
power over people and territory; that power is recognized by 
other states and codified by international law. Government is 
the body or group of persons who run the administration of 
a country. There are various forms of government that differ 
according to where the decision-making power is held, who 
elects the decision-making power, and how power is distrib-
uted (Table 10.1). Different from government, governance refers 
to the norms, rules and laws that are invoked to regulate a peo-
ple or a state. Governance is also thought by scholars to exceed 
explicit regulations and include strategies, tactics, and pro-
cesses for controlling the population of a nation or some other 
organization of individuals. Governance includes a wide range 
of public and private entities from states to NGOs.
What is a citizen?
Citizenship is a category of belonging to a state that includes 
civil, political, and social rights. Following the overthrow or 
decline of monarchies in Europe in the late eighteenth to mid-
nineteenth centuries, a number of new republics were created. 
Republican government, as distinct from monarchy, requires 
the democratic participation and support of its population. 
Monarchical political power is derived from force and subju-
gation; republican political power derives from the support 
These de jure territories are often used as the basic units 
of analysis in human geography, largely because they are both 
convenient and significant units of analysis. They are often, in 
fact, the only areal units for which reliable data are available. 
They are also important in their own right because of their sta-
tus as units of governance or administration. A lot of regional 
analysis and nearly all attempts at regionalization, therefore, 
are based on a framework of de jure spaces.
GEOPOLITICS AND THE  
WORLD ORDER
There is, arguably, no other concept to which political geog-
raphers devote more attention than the state. The state is 
one of the most powerful forces—if not the most powerful— 
implicated in the process of globalization. The state effectively 
regulates, supports, and legitimates the globalization of the 
economy.
States, Nations and Citizenship
The state is an independent political unit with recognized 
boundaries, although some of these boundaries may be in 
dispute. In contrast to a state, a nation is a group of people 
sharing certain elements of culture, such as religion, language, 
history, or political identity. Members of a nation recognize a 
common identity, but they need not reside within a common 
geographical area. For example, the Kurdish nation includes 
members of Kurdish culture throughout the world, regardless 
TABLE 10.1 Forms of Government
Authoritarian
This form is characterized by absolute obedience to a formal authority, opposed to individual freedom and related to an expectation of  
unquestioning obedience.
Autocracy
A system of government in which supreme power is concentrated in the hands of one person, whose decisions are not subject to external legal 
restraints nor regularized mechanisms of popular control.
Dictatorship
This type of government is based on political authority that is monopolized by a single person or a political party, and exercised through various 
oppressive mechanisms.
Democracy
A form of government in which all eligible citizens participate equally—either directly or indirectly through elected representatives—in the  
proposal, development, and creation of laws. The term comes from the Greek and means 'rule of the people.'
Monarchy
A system of government where authority is embodied in one individual. In governments where the monarch has no or few legal restraints, it is an 
absolute monarchy and is a form of autocracy. Monarchs usually have hereditary rights to the throne.
Oligarchy
A form of government where power is concentrated in the hands of a few people (and this can be based on wealth, royalty, family, education, 
religious, corporate or military control).
Regime
This is a system with a set of rules, cultural or social norms that regulate the operation of the government with society. 
Republic
A system in which power resides in the people who elect leaders to run the government.
Theocracy
A form of government in which a god or deity is recognized as the civil ruler and religious leaders administer policy and interpret laws based on 
a divine commission.
Totalitarian
In this system, the state holds total authority over the society and seeks to control all aspects of public and private life wherever possible. 
 Totalitarianism differs from dictatorships in that totalitarianism concerns the scope of the governing power, whereas dictatorships are defined 
by the source of the governing power.

CHAPTER 10   Political Geographies   379
an "imagined community," one that rose 
above divisions of class, culture, and eth-
nicity. This new identity was called citi-
zen, and citizenship came to be based on 
a framework of civil, political, and social 
rights and responsibilities. As our chapter 
opener makes clear, citizenship is bound 
up with a complex legal apparatus that 
determines who can and who cannot join 
the nation.
In the United States, for example, for-
eign-born individuals who wish to migrate 
temporarily are able to enter the country 
through more than 75 different kinds of 
visas. The expectation is that temporary 
migrants will return to their countries of 
origin after the period of their approved 
visit is complete. For immigrants who wish 
to reside in the United States permanently, 
however, they must secure what is infor-
mally known as a green card, or Lawful 
Permanent Residence. Obtaining full citizenship in the United 
States depends upon a number of factors but is an option for 
most green card holders. Significantly, it is estimated that 
about 700,000 individuals arrive in the United States without 
the proper documents. It is not known how many undocu-
mented migrants currently live in the United States. This situa-
tion is a controversial one with no widely acceptable response 
being offered at the federal government level.
Multinational States
Given that nations were created out of very diverse populations, 
it is not surprising that almost no entirely pure nation-states 
exist today. Rather, multinational states—states composed of 
more than one regional or ethnic group—are the norm. Spain 
is such a multinational state (composed of  Catalans, Basques, 
Gallegos, and Castilians), as are France, Kenya, the United 
States, and Bolivia. Indeed, a very limited number of nation-
states are uni-national; Iceland is one of the few that are. Since 
World War I, it has become increasingly common for groups 
of people sharing an identity different from the majority, 
yet living within the same political unit with the majority, 
to agitate to form their own state. This has been the case 
with the Québecois in Canada and the Basques in Spain. 
It is out of this desire for autonomy that the term national-
ism emerges. Nationalism is the feeling of belonging to a 
nation, as well as the belief that a nation has a natural right 
to determine its own affairs. Nationalism can accommodate 
itself to very different social and cultural movements, from 
the white supremacy movements in the United States and 
Europe  (Figure 10.8) to the movements for independence in 
China such as Tibet (Figure 10.9) The impact of minority 
nationalism on the world map was especially pronounced 
during the twentieth century.

bers of the right-wing EDL in a march in the city of Luton. The group opposes

of the governed. By creating a sense of nationhood, the newly 
emerging states of Europe were attempting to homogenize their 
multiple and sometimes conflicting constituencies so that they 
could govern with the population's active cooperation accord-
ing to a sense of common purpose.
Modern citizenship as a political category was a prod-
uct of the popular revolutions—from the English Civil War 
to the American War of Independence—that transformed 
monarchies into republics. In the process, these revolutions 
produced the need to reimagine the socially and culturally 
diverse population occupying the territory of the state. Where 
once they were considered subjects with no need for a unified 
identity, nationhood required of these same people a sense of

united for a common purpose. The newly independent states 
that chose confederation did so mostly for economic (and to 
a lesser extent, for military) purposes. A similar case can be 
found in the Confederate States of America, the 11 southern 
states that seceded from the United States between 1860 and 
1861 to achieve economic and political solidarity. This seces-
sion led ultimately to the Civil War, a bloody conflict that 
caused a massive loss of American lives for both the Union 
and the Confederacy.
With the fall of communism in Eastern Europe in 1991, 
regions such as the Balkans (the mountainous isthmus of land 
between the Danube River and the plains of northern Greece 
that includes Albania, Bulgaria, continental Greece, southeast 
Romania, European Turkey, and most of the territories formerly 
organized as Yugoslavia) also experienced national movements 
resulting in the redrawing of political boundaries. And while 
the breakup of the former USSR had been primarily peace-
ful (with significant exceptions such as Georgia, Ukraine and

Russia's State and National 
Transformation
The history and the present status of the former Soviet Union 
illustrates the tensions among and between states, nations, 
and nationalism. Both enduring nationalism and the desire 
for sovereignty are evident in the history of the Russian 
Empire.  Russia's strategies to bind the 100-plus nationali-
ties (non- Russian ethnic peoples) into a unified Russian state 
were often punitive and seldom successful. Non-Russian 
nations were simply expected to conform to Russian cultural 
norms. Those that did not were more or less persecuted. The 
result was opposition and, among many if not most of the 
nationalities, sometimes rebellion and refusal to bow 
to Russian cultural dominance.
Such was the legacy that Vladimir Lenin and the 
Bolsheviks inherited from the Russian Empire follow-
ing the overthrow of the aristocracy in 1917. The solu-
tion to the "national problem" orchestrated by Lenin 
was recognition of the many nationalities through the 
newly formed Union of Soviet Socialist Republics 
(USSR). Lenin believed that a federal system, with 
federal units delimited according to the geographic 
extent of ethnonational communities, would ensure 
political equality among at least the major nations in 
the new state. This political arrangement recognized 
the different nationalities and provided them a mea-
sure of independence. Federation was also a way of 
bringing reluctant areas of the former Russian Empire 
into the Soviet fold. A federal state allocates power 
to units of local government within the country. The 
United States is a federal state with its system of state, 
county, and city/town government. A federal state can 
be contrasted with a unitary state, in which power is 
concentrated in the central government. The Russian 
state under the czar was a unitary state but a federated 
state as the USSR.
By 1991, the relatively peaceful breakup of the 
Soviet Union was underway, and new states emerged 
to claim their independence. Figure 10.10 is a recent 
map of the former USSR, including all the newly inde-
pendent states now in the Commonwealth of Indepen-
dent States (CIS) and the Baltic states of Estonia, Lat-
via, and Lithuania, which chose not to be members of 
the CIS. The CIS is a confederation, a group of states 
▼ Figure 10.10 Independent states of the former Soviet Union For the 
most part, the administrative structure of the USSR has remained in place. Until 
recently, the autonomous regions and republics had more than nominal local 
control, and the former federal republics had become independent states 
(pictured here in various colors).

CHAPTER 10   Political Geographies   381
Althusser
An especially influential state theorist whose work has inspired 
a large number of political geographers is Louis Althusser who 
developed an approach that identifies the operations of the 
state in two ways:
■ Recognizing the state as an ideological force operating 
through the institutions of the schools, the media, the fam-
ily, and religion to produce citizens who conform to state 
expectations
■ Viewing the state as repressive through different institu-
tions like the courts, army, and the police, to compel citi-
zens to comply with its rules
These two related aspects of a model for understanding the 
state have been employed by political geographers in a number 
of ways, but perhaps the most common is to explore how the 
spaces of these various institutions, such as the school or the 
family, are produced and operate to shape citizens.
Foucault
A theorist who has also been a significant influence on politi-
cal geography is Michel Foucault who pushed Althusser's 
ideas further by exploring just how the various institutions 
of the state operate to do the work of shaping citizens. Fou-
cault examined how power, knowledge, and discourse oper-
ate in concert to produce particular kinds of subjects: citizens, 
women, soldiers, terrorists.
For Foucault, discourse is made through the rules, identi-
ties, practices, exclusions, and a range of other elements that 
form a way of thinking about something. For example, an army 
turns civilians into soldiers through the combination of power 
(in the form of both force and cooperation) and knowledge 
Chechnya), the redrawing of national boundaries in the Bal-
kans resulted in bitter and widespread ethnic conflict. The 
region is situated at a geopolitical crossroads where East meets 
West, Islam meets Christendom, the Ottoman Empire met the 
Austro-Hungarian Empire, and communism once confronted 
capitalist democracy.
The most extreme conflict in the region occurred during 
the late 1990s in Kosovo, a region within Serbia that lost its 
autonomy in 1989 when Serbian nationalist leader Slobodan 
Milosevic placed it under military occupation. A year later 
Kosovo's parliament was abolished and its political lead-
ers fled. Milosevic orchestrated numerous attempts to rid the 
region of ethnic Albanians, and in 1995 Serb refugees from 
Croatia began flooding into Kosovo. Fueled by the racist rheto-
ric and military support of Milosevic, a civil war between Serbs 
and ethnic Albanians eventually erupted. By late 1999, 800,000 
ethnic Albanians had fled Kosovo and tens of thousands had 
been massacred. An 11-week air war by NATO helped to bring 
the conflict to a halt, although atrocities continued as ethnic 
Albanians retaliated against Serbs. Kosovo became an indepen-
dent state in 2008 (Figure 10.11).
State Theory
The definition of the state provided in the previous section is a 
static one. The state, through its institutions—such as the mili-
tary or the educational system—can act to protect national ter-
ritory and harmonize the interests of its people. Therefore, the 
state stands behind a set of institutions for the protection and 
maintenance of society. A state is not only a place, a bounded 
territory, it is also an active entity that operates through the 
rules and regulations of its various institutions, from social-
service agencies to governing bodies to the courts, to shape a 
country's populations.

Compare and contrast each theorist's contribution by reflecting

2. Based on Foucault's theory of discourse, explain how a state

different categories of state subjects like minorities, immigrants, or 
homosexual men and women. 
Imperialism and Colonialism
Geopolitics may involve the extension of power by one group 
over another. Two ways this may occur are through the related 
processes of imperialism and colonialism. Recall from Chapter 2,  
Imperialism is the extension of state authority over the politi-
cal and economic life of other territories. Over the last 500 
years, imperialism has resulted in the political or economic 
domination of strong core states over the weaker states of the 
periphery. Imperialism does not necessarily imply formal gov-
ernmental control over the dominated area; it may also involve 
a process by which some countries pressure the independent 
governments of other countries to behave in certain ways. This 
pressure can take many forms, such as military threat, eco-
nomic sanctions, or cultural domination. Imperialism always 
involves some form of authoritative control of one state by 
another.
Imperialism As discussed in Chapter 2, the process of impe-
rialism begins with exploration (Figure 10.12), often prompted 
by the state's perception that there is a scarcity or lack of a crit-
ical natural resource. It culminates in development via coloni-
zation or the exploitation of indigenous people and resources, 
or both. In the first phases of imperialism, the core exploits the 
periphery for raw materials. As the periphery becomes devel-
oped, colonization may occur and economies based on money 
transactions—or "cash economies"—may be introduced where 
none previously existed. The periphery may also become a 
market for the manufactured goods of the core. Eventually, 
though not always, the periphery—because of the availabil-
ity of cheap labor, land, and other inputs to production—can 
become a new arena for large-scale capital investment. Some 
peripheral countries improve their status and become semipe-
ripheral or even core countries. Figure 10.13 is a map of the 
colonies created by European imperialism in Africa.
Colonialism is a form of imperialism. It involves the formal 
establishment and maintenance of rule by a sovereign power 
over a foreign population through the establishment of settle-
ments. The colony does not have any independent standing 
within the world system and instead is considered an adjunct 
of the colonizing power. From the fifteenth to the early twenti-
eth centuries, colonialism constituted an important component 
of core expansion. Between 1500 and 1900, the primary colo-
nizing states were Britain, Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, 
and France. Figure 10.14 illustrates the imperialism and the 
post-colonization situation in South America.
(accumulated insights about training, discipline, and warfare). 
The result is an institutional way of thinking that make large 
numbers of individuals function as an effective group.
Deleuze
Another state theorist important to geographers is Giles 
Deleuze. Different from Althusser and Foucault but building 
on their work, he recognizes that
■ the state is not just a set of institutions—the courts, the leg-
islature, the military, and so on—but a force; and
■ the force is greater than formal institutions at the same 
time that it works through them.
For Deleuze, the state is not a thing but a principle that works 
by way of authority. Deleuze rejects the commonly held view 
that the state was "created" during a particular period of human 
history and then expanded its power over time. He contends that 
the state has always existed in different forms, even before the 
emergence of the institutions by which we most clearly recog-
nize it now. Deleuze believes that the state is best thought of as a 
machine, with its purpose being to regulate and dominate. This 
machine of the state operates through mundane practices that 
produce a population willing to submit to authority whether a 
police officer, a forest ranger, a teacher, or a president.
Biopolitics
Biopolitics is the extension of state power over the physical 
and political bodies of a population. Most often attributed to 
Foucault, biopolitics or biopower is also associated with polit-
ical theorists who preceded him as well as those who wrote 
simultaneously with and after him. The key objective of bio-
politics is to regulate the national population—the social 
body—by shaping the individuals that constitute it.
Biopolitics operates through monitoring, recording, 
categorizing and policing to optimize the vitality of the popu-
lation and ensure a healthy workforce. As a result, the popu-
lation is sorted according to differences such as age, gender, 
ethnicity, race, health status, income, household size, and so 
on. The census, as discussed in Chapter 3, is a massive under-
taking meant to produce statistical data on these differences. A 
contemporary extension of demographic monitoring might be 
seen in the increasing ability to manipulate life at the molecu-
lar level through recombinant genetics or the ability to select 
for particular traits through assisted reproductive technology.
Geographers have incorporated these and other theories 
of the state to explain the unfolding impact of different kinds 
of political spaces, from the organization and influence of the 
classroom to the development and effects of international laws. 
For political geographers, theories and models of geopolitics 
have been their most prominent contributions to understand-
ing the role and behavior of the state. The revolutionary fervor 
that spread across North Africa and the Middle East in 2011 is 
an illustration of geopolitics and the relationship of a national 
population to its state (see Box 10.2, "Window on the World: 
The Arab Spring and its Aftermath").

2.  Select any country that was under colonial rule. Examine how colo-
nialism and imperialism affected the drawing of the present national 
boundaries. Did they rupture pre-existing alliances and affiliations of 
the people, and create new ones? How did colonialism and imperial-
ism form national identities and affect nationalist feelings?
Orientalism and Post-colonialism
The reasons Britain was able to be so callous in its colonial prac-
tices are complex. Theorist Edward Said has proposed the con-
cept of Orientalism to explain them, at least in part. For Said, 
Orientalism is a discourse that positions the West as culturally 
superior to the East seeing Eastern societies as unchanging and 
undeveloped and therefore inferior. This mischaracterization 
allows the West to possess as well as deploy patronizing per-
ceptions of the Middle East, Asian, and North African societies 
(the East or Orient). The colonized are seen as inferior and in 
need of disciplining to the superior and enlightened colonizer. 
The colonizer has a moral obligation to colonize, according to 
this logic. Said was a humanities scholar and his criticism was 
leveled at literature but his ideas have been embraced by social 
scientists as well. Importantly, Said's book, Orientalism (1978) 
was a major contributor to the then emerging field of postcolo-
nial studies, an academic discipline that focuses on the cultural 
legacies of colonialism and imperialism.
The postcolonial history of the Indian subcontinent has 
included partition and repartition, as well as the eruption of 
regional and ethnic conflicts. In 1947, Pakistan split off from India 
and became a separate Muslim state. In 1971, Bangladesh, previ-
ously part of Pakistan, declared its independence. Regional con-
flicts include radical Sikh and Islamic movements for indepen-
dence in the states of Punjab and Kashmir, respectively. Ethnic 
conflicts include decades of physical violence between Muslims 
and Hindus over religious beliefs and the privileging of Hindus 
over Muslims in the national culture and economy. It would be 
misleading, however, to attribute all of India's current strife to 
colonialism. The Hindu caste system, which distinguishes social 
classes based on heredity and plays a significant role in political 
conflict, preceded British colonization and persists to this day.
Since the turn of the nineteenth century, the effects of colo-
nialism have continued to be felt as peoples all over the globe 
struggle for political and economic independence. The 1994 
civil war in Rwanda is a sobering example of the ill effects of 
colonialism. As in India, where an estimated 1 million Hin-
dus and Muslims died in a civil war when the British pulled 
out, the exit of Belgium from Rwanda left colonially created 
Important states more recently involved in colonization 
and imperialist wars include the United States and Japan. 
Although colonial penetration often results in political domi-
nance by the colonizer, such is not always the case. For exam-
ple, Britain may have succeeded in setting up British colonial 
communities in China, but it never succeeded in imposing 
British administrative or legal structures in any widespread 
way. And at the end of the colonial era, a few former colonies, 
such as the United States, Canada, and Australia, became core 
states themselves. Others, such as Rwanda, Bolivia, and Cam-
bodia, remain firmly within the periphery. Some former colo-
nies, such as Mexico, India and Brazil, have come close to the 
core but have not fully attained core status and are categorized 
as being within the semiperiphery.
The Effects of Colonialism An example of colonialism 
is the extension of British rule in India, which began with 
the establishment of the East India Trading Company in the 
mid-eighteenth century. The British government gave the 
company the power to establish forts and settlements, as well 
as to maintain an army. The company soon established settle-
ments—including factories—in Mumbai (formerly Bombay), 
Chennai (formerly Madras), and Calcutta. What began as a 
small trading and manufacturing operation burgeoned over 
time into a major military, administrative, and economic 
presence by the British government and did not end until 
Indian independence in 1947. During that 200-year period, 
Indians were brutalized and killed and their society trans-
formed by British influence. That influence permeated all 
aspects of daily life and institutions from language and judi-
cial procedure to cultural identity.
Migration from South Asia over the last 50 years has been 
dramatic with Indians, Bangladeshis, and Pakistanis living all 
▲ Figure 10.15 Curry restaurants, Brick Lane, London The British pres-
ence in India affected culture, politics, the economy, and the layout of cities, 
as well as numerous other aspects of everyday life. Importantly, Indian culture 
has come to influence British culture even more directly through immigrants 
who've migrated to the Great Britain.

10.2   Window on the World
The Arab Spring and Its Aftermath
Despite the fact that Iran is not Arab, and its "Green Revolution" occurred 
in 2009, the protests that gathered momentum in Tehran and swept across 
the country, can be seen as a powerful inspiration for what became known 
as the Arab Spring—massive popular protests that occurred across North 
Africa and parts of the Middle East in Spring 2011 (Figure 10.C).
Tunisia's was the first uprising to occur in the region and there is no 
doubt that its "Jasmine Revolution" served to embolden other national pro-
tests. Sustained public anger there, which forced the president out of office 
after nearly a quarter century, was ignited by the suicide of a young, unem-
ployed man who set fire to himself after officials prevented him from selling 
fruits and vegetables on the street.
In Egypt, the world watched in awe as President Hosni Mubarak, in 
power for three decades, resigned in response to the demands of millions 
of protestors as well as pressure from the international community. Instru-
mental in sparking the protests was the video blogging of a 26-year-old 
woman who urged the Egyptian people to join her in Tahrir Square to 
bring down Mubarak's regime. Her posts went viral and the event attracted 
80,000 attendees.
In Morocco—different from its neighbors in that the country has a suc-
cessful economy, an elected parliament, and a reformist monarchy—the pro-
testers were pushing for reform that would "restore dignity and end graft." 
Behind the facade of prosperity is a country of impoverished youth with 
little chance of employment and a government elite living obscenely lavish 
lives. In Mauritania, peaceful protests called attention to similar issues as well 
as an end to human rights abuses.
Algeria is also a country that on the surface seems generally prosperous, 
based on its sizeable oil and gas reserves. Protesters there demanded that 
the Algerian constitution limit presidential terms.
Saudi Arabia experienced no sizeable protests, probably because oppo-
sition movements are banned there; the country's vast oil reserves make it

one of the wealthiest of the Arab states; and the country is deeply conserva-
tive with a population that supports King Abdullah.
In Bahrain, people died in protests demanding that King Hamad take 
action to increase political freedoms and eliminate job discrimination that 
favors the governing Sunni Muslim minority. As small groups of demonstra-
tors gathered in the center of the capital city Manama, King Hamad swiftly 
imposed a state of emergency and cleared the protesters' camps in a brutal 
show of force aided by Saudi and United Arab Emirates soldiers.
In both Jordan and Oman, protests were limited but the demands of the 
protestors were familiar: job creation, controls on food prices, an end to gov-
ernment corruption, and more democratic government. The same demands 
issued from quickly shut down protests in Qatar and Kuwait. Young people 
across the Middle East and North Africa were the key elements of the protests.
In Libya, Yemen, and Syria, revolutions turned into armed insurrection. 
Uncharacteristic of the larger movement in the region, where nonviolent 
protest was the explicit objective, protests in these three countries were 
directed at the intransigence of the leaders and the deep frustration and 
righteous anger of the protesters.
Libyans rose up against their ruler, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, one 
of the most autocratic and longest-ruling dictators in the region. Citizens 
demanded a return to a multiparty democracy, a reduction in unemploy-
ment and poverty, freedom from domestic surveillance, and the right to 
gather peacefully to express dissent. Gaddafi ordered the police to fire on 
the peaceful protesters.
The response was an armed uprising that spread across the country, pit-
ting government forces against civilians. In October 2011 Colonel Gaddafi 
was killed by Libyan rebel forces.
The situations in Syria and Yemen also turned violent. Yemen is the Arab 
world's poorest nation where about half of its 23 million people live on $2 a 
day or less and one-third suffer from chronic hunger. Yemeni protest led to 
the ouster of their president. The violence against peaceful protesters there 
was brutal.
The Syrian government, too, met peaceful protest with an armed 
response. Government forces deployed tanks, shelled residential areas, and 
used snipers on rooftops to kill protesters. A bloody civil war has ensued 
and well over 100,000 Syrians have died and over 2 million refugees have 
fled the country. As described in a later section, the situation in Syria has 
become complicated by the emergence of an extremist movement that has 
claimed the establishment of an Islamic state in parts of Iraq and Syria.
After the Arab Spring
Upheaval across the Arab World in 2011 has not led to many positive 
changes with some countries engaged in brutal civil wars. Many observers 
believe that the region's long-standing political order, consisting largely of 
military governments or rule by postcolonial dynasties, are unlikely to let go 
of the monopolies on economic resources they control. It seems clear that 
movement toward democratic rule—which would include accountability, 
transparency, and equality—will be very slow:
■ Egypt's military ousted a democratically elected president and  
replaced him with a general who was recently elected to hold that  
seat.
■ On the Arabian Peninsula (Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Oman, and Kuwait) as 
well as in Jordan, the ruling monarchs have managed to maintain the 
status quo. In the Gulf States, generous handouts such as state jobs and 
discounted housing were distributed in exchange for political passivity. 
Bahrain is the exception where protest by the majority Shiites against 
the Sunni-ruled kingdom continue.
■ The presence of al-Qaeda in Yemen as well as separatist challenges to 
government authority have made that country an increasingly unstable 
place. Many observers believe Yemen is in danger of becoming a failed 
state.
■ In Morocco and Algeria, little if anything has changed.
■ The one bright spot is Tunisia, which adopted a new constitution, one 
that for the first time includes rights for women. Compared to the coup 
in Egypt, the horrific civil war in Syria, and suppression in Bahrain and 
instability in Yemen, Tunisia's revolution stands out among "Arab Spring" 
countries as having survived.
 
1. What is the Arab Spring? What makes is it a geopolitical 
phenomenon?
 
2. Why are there different types of protests and different responses 
by the the various government to them among the many countries 
that participated in the Arab Spring.

1. Define the concept of Orientalism. Why do you think this mentality 
created political problems that continue to exist in former colonies?
2. On the Internet, find three different recent news articles from rep-
utable sources about a political issue in the Middle East. Consider  
the articles from the perspective of Orientalism. How do the arti-
cles depict the West and the Middle East? Is the West depicted as 
being culturally superior to the Middle East? If so, show how that  
is accomplished. If not, explain how the journalists avoid adopting  
an Orientalist explanation.
The North/South Divide The colonization of Africa, 
South America, parts of the Pacific, Asia, and smaller territo-
ries scattered throughout the Southern Hemisphere resulted 
in a political geographic division of the world into North and 
South, known as the North/South divide. In the North are the 
imperialist states of Europe, the United States, Russia, and 
Japan. In the South are colonized states. Though the equator 
is often used as a dividing line, some so-called Southern terri-
tories, such as Australia and New Zealand, actually are part of 
the North in an economic sense.
The crucial point is that a relation of dependence was set 
up between countries in the South (the periphery) and those in 
the North (the core) that began with colonialism and persists 
even today. Only a few peripheral countries have become pros-
perous and economically competitive since achieving politi-
cal autonomy, though that is beginning to change, as this book 
addresses in Chapter 8. Political independence is markedly 
different from economic independence, and the South remains 
very much oriented to the economic demands of the North.
Decolonization The reacquisition by colonized peoples 
of control over their own territory is known as decoloniza-
tion. In many cases, sovereign statehood has been achievable 
only through armed conflict. From the Revolutionary War in 
the United States to the twentieth-century decolonization of 
Africa, the world map created by the colonizing powers has 
repeatedly been redrawn. Many former colonies achieved 
independence after World War I. Deeply desirous of averting 
wars like the one that had just ended, the victors (excluding 
the United States, which entered a period of isolationism fol-
lowing the war) established the League of Nations. One of 
the first international organizations ever formed, the League 
of Nations had a goal of international peace and security. An 
international organization is one that includes two or more 
tribal rivalries unresolved and seething. Although the Germans 
were the first to colonize Rwanda, the Belgians, who arrived 
after World War I, established political dominance among the 
Tutsi by allowing them special access to education and the 
bureaucracy.
Previously, a complementary relationship had existed 
between the Tutsi, who were cattle herders, and the more 
numerous Hutu, who were agriculturists. In effect, colo-
nialism introduced difference into an existing political and 
social structure that had operated more or less peacefully for 
centuries. In 1959, the Hutus rebelled and the Belgians aban-
doned their Tutsi favorites to side with the Hutus. In 1962, the 
Belgians ceded independence to Rwanda, leaving behind a vol-
atile political situation that has erupted periodically ever since, 
most tragically in 1994's civil war. After a year of violence in 
which over half a million Tutsis were killed, the Hutus were 
driven across the border to the Democratic Republic of Congo 
(DRC) and a new Tutsi-led Rwandan government was formed. 
The Hutu refugees gathered in UN camps that gradually came 
to be controlled by armed extremists, who transformed them 
into virtual military bases and used them to attack the Tutsis in 
Rwanda (Figure 10.16). When Rwanda's Tutsi-led military, with 
Uganda's support, invaded the DRC to break up the camps, 
over a million refugees were released. Refugees have since dis-
persed across Central Africa.
To help address the culture of impunity that angered so 
many Rwandans, the UN established a truth commission, known 
as "Gacaca Court System," based on Rwandan traditional justice. 
Although its work has had some important moral impacts, the 
commission's aim—enabling Tutsis and Hutus to work together 
to rebuild their society and economy—has not been realized. 
Hundreds of thousands of children have become orphans as 
their parents either died in the atrocities or their mothers were 
infected with HIV/AIDS through rape and have since died. The 
country spends more on debt repayments to international banks 
than it does on education and health. Seventy percent of all 
households in Rwanda live below the national poverty line.
◀ Figure 10.16 Refugees returning to Rwanda Fleeing civil unrest in 
their own country, Rwandans from the Hutu tribe increasingly sought refuge 
in the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire) when the Tutsi-led 
government assumed power in 1994. Two-and-a-half years later, over half 
a million Rwandan refugees in the Democratic Republic of Congo occupied 
some of the largest refugee camps in the world. In late 1996, they began 
streaming back into Rwanda when the Tutsi-led government urged them to 
come help rebuild the country.

states seeking political and/or eco-
nomic cooperation with each other.  
Figure 10.17 shows the member coun-
tries of the League.
Within the League, a system was 
designed to assess the possibilities 
for independence of colonies and to 
ensure that the process occurred in an 
orderly fashion. Known as the  colonial 
mandate system, it had some suc-
cess in overseeing the dismantling of 
numerous colonial administrations.  
Figures 10.18  illustrates decolonization 
during the twentieth century in Asia and 
the South Pacific. Although the League 
of Nations proved effective in settling 
minor international disputes, it was 
unable to prevent aggression by major 
powers and was dissolved in 1946. It 
did, however, serve as the model for the 
United Nations.

▲ Figure 10.18 Independence in Asia and the South Pacific, before and after 1960 Decolonization 
and independence are not uniform phenomena. The form of colonial domination that was imposed is as 
much a  factor as the composition and level of political organization that existed in an area before  colonization 
occurred. Mostly, decolonization and political independence forced societies into a nation-state mold for 
which they had little, if any,  preparation.

tinue to be dramatically shaped in a variety of ways by core states. 
Participation in foreign aid, trade, and investments from core 
countries subjects the periphery to relations that are little differ-
ent from those they experienced as colonial subjects. This process 
is known as neocolonialism, the use of economic, political, and 
cultural arrangements to influence a country, in the absence of 
more direct control. Ghanaian president Kwame Nkrumah coined 
the term to describe how promoting a capitalist culture in a for-
merly colonized country helps assimilate the local people into 
the norms of the neocolonizer, which enables the opening of the 
country to foreign corporate entry.
In former British colony Kenya, for example, core coun-
tries' provision of foreign aid monies, development expertise, 
and educational opportunities to selected individuals has 
created a class of native civil servants that is in many ways 
more strongly connected to core processes and networks than 
those operating within Kenya. This relatively small group of 
men and women, often foreign educated, emerged as the first 
capitalist middle class in Kenyan history. Their cultural ties 
become complicated and their loyalties divided as they form 
an elite class that transmits global corporate culture even more 
deeply into their country. One aspect of elite governing classes 
in some formerly colonized countries has been extreme corrup-
tion. While corruption occurs in core and peripheral regions, 
its effects are felt most significantly by the poor (See Box 10.4 
Spatial Inequality: Global Corruption).

Heartland Theory By the end of the nineteenth century, 
numerous formal empires were well established and imperial-
ist ideologies were dominant. To justify the strategic value of 
colonialism and explain the dynamic processes and possibili-
ties behind the new world map created by imperialism,  Halford 
Mackinder (1861-1947) developed a theory. Mackinder was a 
professor of geography at Oxford University and director of the 
London School of Economics. Given his background in geogra-
phy, economics, and government, it is not surprising that his 
theory highlighted the importance of geography to world polit-
ical and economic stability and conflict.
Mackinder believed that Eurasia was the most likely base 
from which a successful campaign for world conquest could be 
launched. He considered its closed heartland to be the "geograph-
ical pivot," the location central to establishing global control. 
Mackinder premised his model on the conviction that the age 
of maritime exploration, beginning with Columbus, was draw-
ing to a close. He theorized that land transportation technology, 
especially railways, would reinstate land-based power, and sea 
prowess would no longer be as essential to political dominance. 
Eurasia, which had been politically powerful in earlier centu-
ries, would rise again because it was adjacent to the borders of so 
many important countries and it was strategically buttressed by 
an inner and outer crescent of landmasses (Figure 10.19).
When Mackinder presented his geostrategic theory in 
1904, Russia controlled a large portion of the Eurasian land-
mass protected from British sea power. In an address to the 
British Royal Geographical Society, Mackinder suggested that 
the "empire of the world" would be in sight if one power, or 
combination of powers, came to control the heartland. He 
believed that Germany allied with Russia and China organized 
by Japan were alliances to be feared. Mackinder's theory was a 
product of the age of imperialism. To understand why Britain 
adopted this theory, it is important to remember that antago-
nism was increasing among the core European states, leading 
to World War I a decade later.
Mackinder's geopolitical theory has certain resonance 
today. An example is the aggressive nationalism of Vladimir 
Putin, the current prime minister of Russia. As mentioned 
earlier in this chapter, the breakup of the Soviet Union cre-
ated extensive regional realignments in the former confedera-
tion. Putin's response to the Western leanings of Estonia and 
Georgia and Russia's invasion of Chechnya (a region that is 
part of Russia) and more recently Ukraine have some observ-
ers asserting that a new round of Russian empire-building 
is underway. Although Putin is not likely to attempt expan-
sion into Central Europe, he could undermine those coun-
tries by his capture of the Crimean Peninsula, which he 
accomplished in Spring 2014. As their next-door neighbor, 
a re-Russified Ukraine, is a worrisome prospect. Expanding 
into Ukraine has given Russia access to the Mediterranean, 
the transit route between the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea. 
Further, it has given Russia complete access to known fuel 
reserves in the maritime zone around the peninsula worth 
trillions of dollars. Many political geographers today believe 
that Mackinder's theories are outdated, but Prime Minister 
Putin's recent aggressions and animosity toward what he 
regards as the "traitorous" former republics and breakaway 
regions underscore the current relevance of his geostrategic 
formulations.
The East/West Divide In addition to a North/South divide 
based on imperialism and colonialism, the world order of 
states can also be viewed as dividing along an East/West split. 
The East/West divide refers to the gulf between communist 
and noncommunist countries, respectively. The East/West 
divide has played a significant role in global politics since at 
least the end of World War II in 1945 and, perhaps more accu-
rately, since the Russian Revolution in 1917. By the second 
decade of the twentieth century, the major world powers were 
backing away from colonization. Still, many were reluctant to 
accelerate decolonization for fear that independent countries 
in Africa and elsewhere would choose communist political 
and economic systems instead of some form of Western-style 
capitalism.

CHAPTER 10   Political Geographies   391
Cuba provides an interesting illustration of an East/
West tension that persists despite the official end of the 
Cold War: the state of heightened military and political ten-
sion as well as economic competition between the former 
Soviet Union and its satellite states and the United States 
and its allies, lasting from 1946 to 1991. Although Cuba did 
not become independent from Spain until 1902, 
U.S. interest in the island dates back to the estab-
lishment of trade relations in the late eighteenth 
century. In the first half of the twentieth cen-
tury, U.S. economic imperialism replaced Span-
ish colonialism and wrought major changes in 
the island's global linkages. Cuba, at that time, 
was experiencing a series of reform and revolu-
tionary movements that culminated in the rise 
of Fidel Castro, a committed communist, in the 
1950s. This period coincided with a moment 
in U.S. history when anticommunist sentiment 
was at its peak. Castro came to power by 1959 
and the United States initially responded with a 
militarily aggressive stance toward Cuba. Since 
then U.S. relations with Cuba have been pre-
mised on economic sanctions. Since the turn of

continental and part oceanic.

the efforts of President George W. Bush. President Barack 
Obama has reduced travel restrictions but failed to lift the 
economic embargo (Figure 10.20).

elections (Figure 10.21). While fostering the miraculous growth 
of its economy, it has kept the majority of wealth in the hands 
of an elite. At the same time, the antidemocratic CCP exercises 
outright censorship through its control of the media and has 
been particularly effective in mollifying the Chinese public 
by distracting them from the real inequities in society. The 
model of government in China is best described at authoritar-
ian capitalism.
Domino Theory Although the United States was unable 
to stop Castro's rise to power in Cuba, the end of World War 
II marked the rise of the United States to a dominant position 
among countries of the core. Following the war, the tension  
that arose between East and West translated into a U.S. 
foreign policy pitched in opposition to the Soviet Union. 
Domino theory underlay that foreign policy, which included 
economic, political, and military objectives directed at pre-
venting Soviet world domination. Domino theory held that 
if one country in a region chose, or was forced to accept, 
a communist political and economic system, neighboring 
countries would fall to communism as well, just as one fall-
ing domino in a line of dominos causes all the others to fall. 
The means of preventing the domino-like spread of commu-
nism was often military aggression (Figure 10.22).
Domino theory first took root in 1947, when the postwar 
United States feared communism would spread from Greece 
to Turkey to Western Europe. It culminated in U.S. wars in 
China and the East/West Divide
The West's anxieties about communism also included China, 
though after World War II it was not seen as important to 
Western interests nor did Europe or the United States have 
the resources to challenge the growing communist movement 
there. Even as the communist revolution took control of China, 
no Western military action was taken to challenge it. Instead, 
as concern over the power of the USSR was rising, the West 
made efforts to limit Soviet/Chinese collaboration by maintain-
ing diplomatic ties with China. President Richard Nixon was 
the first to make significant steps toward improving relations 
with China. He was followed by Presidents Carter, Reagan, and 
George H.W. Bush. Each also helped to expand economic and 
cultural relations with China so that by the late 1980s a rap-
prochement (a diplomatic term for reconciliation) with China 
was fully established.
It is important to appreciate that during the half century 
(including the present moment) that the West has been diplo-
matically engaging with China, it has remained a communist 
country. Its embrace of liberal capitalist and centrally-directed 
economic practices should not be mistaken for anything like an 
equal enthusiasm for democracy. China is a one-party commu-
nist state known as the People's Republic of China (PRC). The 
Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is a tightly organized, hierar-
chical bureaucracy with authoritarian power concentrated at 
the top. The CCP controls all levels of society and there are no

The New World Order
With the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the Cold War came 
to an end. Socialist and communist countries, such as China 
and the USSR had already been warming to Western-style 
capitalist economic development. With the collapse of the 
latter in December 1991, President George H.W. Bush made a 
speech referring to a "new world order." The new world order 
assumes that with the triumph of capitalism over communism, 
the United States is the world's only superpower and therefore 
its policing force. With the political, economic, and cultural 
dominance of the United States comes the worldwide promo-
tion of liberal democracy and of a global economy predicated 
on transnational corporate growth through organizations like 
the World Bank and the World Trade Organization. Military 
prowess is also an important aspect of being the world's police 
Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Nicaragua, and El Salvador and geno-
cide in Cambodia, when Khmer Rouge communist revolu-
tionaries overcame the U.S.-backed military government in 
1975. However, preventing the domino effect was based not 
just on military aggression. Cooperation was also emphasized. 
For example, the international military alliance NATO (North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization) was established in 1949 with the 
stated purpose of safeguarding the West against Soviet aggres-
sion. After World War II, the core countries set up a variety 
of foreign aid, trade, and banking organizations to open for-
eign markets and bring peripheral countries into the global 
capitalist economic system. The strategy not only improved 
productivity in the core countries but was also seen as a way 
of strengthening the position of the West in its confrontation 
with the East.
▲ Figure 10.22 Domino Theory As this graphic shows, the fear in the capitalist world was that if one country fell to communism its neighbors would as well.  
Domino theory is still invoked today though not necessarily in terms of communism. (Source: Bunge's Atlas of Nuclear way; http://indiemaps.com/blog/2010/03/wild-billbunge/)

Figure 10.1.3 U.S. military spending compared to other countries.
Military or defense spending—the amount of economic resources devoted to military purposes—reﬂects a range of 
economic, political and security concerns for any state.  Defense spending is often a reﬂection of perceptions of external 
threats or the potential need to exert aggression in order to establish legitimacy or superiority.
Military expenditure often constitutes a signiﬁcant portion of a national budget.  The United States, which is the world's largest military 
spender, devoted 18 percent of its 2013 budget to defense. Military spending includes a wide range of budget items including weapons 
and procurement, personnel pay, housing and outﬁtting, operations (war, security maneuvers, etc.), administration, research and 
development, nuclear programs, construction and other things. 
While the U.S. population—Democratic, Republican and independent 
voters—would all like to see a reduction in military spending, 
Congress rarely responds positively to the American peoples' 
preferences on defense spending issues.

In 2013, the latest year for which data are available, global military spending was $1.747 trillion. Military spending continues to increase in 
peripheral countries, likely because of a combination of increasing economic growth and a related concern for security but also because of 
the preponderance of autocratic regimes in the region and a possibly emerging regional arms race.

Faith-based Terrorism While subnational resistance orga-
nizations using terrorist tactics continue to operate throughout 
the world, the most widely recognized terrorism of the new 
century has religious roots. The September 11 attacks have 
helped to bring the realities of religious terrorism sharply into 
public focus. The connection between religion and terrorism 
is nothing new as terrorism has been perpetrated by religious 
fanatics for more than 2,000 years. Indeed, words like zealot, 
assassin, and thug all stem from fundamentalist religious 
movements of previous eras. And while the links between 
Muslims and terrorism in the world today are especially strong 
and geographically widespread, it is critical to understand that 
Muslim terrorism is not the only form of terrorism and that 
domestic terrorism sparked by fundamentalist Christian orga-
nizations has taken the lives of hundreds of innocent people 
and continues to be a threat in the United States and elsewhere.
A chilling example of domestic terrorism in the United 
States is the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Office 
Building in Oklahoma City in April 1995, when 168 people 
were killed (Figure 10.23). In June 1997, Timothy McVeigh, 
a U.S. Army veteran and Christian white supremacist, was 
convicted in federal court of perpetrating the attack. McVeigh 
was executed by lethal injection in June 2001, and his accom-
plice, Terry L. Nichols, was sentenced to life in prison. Both 
McVeigh and Nichols were connected to the Christian Iden-
tity movement through a group that came to be known as the 
Michigan Militia Corps, a paramilitary survivalist organiza-
tion. The Christian Identity movement is just one of several 
religious extremist groups in the United States, including 
other forms of white supremacy movements, apocalyptic 
cults, and Black Hebrew Israelism. The Christian Identity 
movement is based on a belief in the superiority of whiteness 
as ordained by God.
The War on Terror in Iraq The United States responded to 
the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, by declaring a global 
war against terrorism and identifying first Afghanistan and 
then Iraq as the greatest threats to U.S. security  (Figure 10.24).  
Although the evidence of involvement in the 9/11 attacks by 
Iraq and its leader, Saddam Hussein, was highly questionable, 
on March 19, 2003, after amassing over 200,000 U.S. troops in 
the Persian Gulf region, President George W. Bush ordered the 
bombing of the city of Baghdad, Iraq. The declaration of war 
force as Box 10.3 Visualizing Geography: Global Military 
Spending, makes clear. It also suggests that there are countries 
vying for dominance.
Terrorism However, the move toward liberal, Western-style 
democracies and capitalist consumption practices necessary 
to the success of the new global economy has created instabil-
ity in many parts of the world. This instability is especially 
problematic where the Cold War struggle between the United 
States and the Soviet Union was once waged, in countries 
that once appeared ripe for succumbing to communism.
With the emergence of a new world order, radical forms 
of warfare and political practices replaced more conventional 
ones. The attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon 
on September 11, 2001, and the resulting war on terrorism are 
prime examples of the political and economic restructuring 
impulses of the new world order. The terrorist attacks and the 
subsequent response by the United States and other govern-
ments make clear that terrorism is the pivotal factor in current 
global geopolitics.
Terrorism is a complicated concept whose definition 
very much depends on the social and historical context. A 
very simple definition is that terrorism is the threat or use 
of force to bring about political change. It is most commonly 
understood as actions by individuals or groups of individu-
als against civilian populations to undermine state prac-
tices or institutions. But the state can also be an agent of 
terrorism. Terrorism involves violent acts directed against 
society—whether by antigovernment actors, governments 
themselves, angry mobs or militants, or even psychotic 
individuals—and it will always mean different things to 
different people.
The term terrorism was first used during the French Revo-
lution (1789-1795) to describe the new revolutionary govern-
ment's repression of its people during the "Reign of Terror." 
By the mid-twentieth century, some used the term to describe 
many left-wing groups, as well as subnationalists (minority 
groups within the nation-state), or radical ethnic groups. In 
the 1980s, the violent activity of hate groups—anti-gay, racist, 
neo-Nazi organizations—in the United States was described 
by some as terrorist. At the same time, terrorism internation-
ally was identified as a brand of ethnic or subnational warfare 
sponsored by rogue regimes.
Ethnic and subnational terrorism affects many countries 
today, including Russia, Uzbekistan, India, China, Colombia, 
the Philippines, Israel, and Rwanda. In Sri Lanka, the Tamil 
minority rebelled in the early 1980s against the oppressive 
Sinhalese majority. Originally a political movement, even-
tually the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam launched a bru-
tal campaign of terror that left over 65,000 people dead. 
Another ethnic or subnational violent struggle involves 
the Russian region of Chechnya, where the population has 
demanded independence. For the Muslim Chechens, Rus-
sia is acting as a terrorist state by employing military force 
to keep them from gaining independence. Chechens believe 
they have little in common politically, historically, or cul-
turally with Russia.

and invasion occurred without the explicit authorization of the 
UN Security Council, and some legal authorities take the view 
that the action violated the UN Charter. Some of the staunch-
est U.S. allies (Germany, France, and Canada) as well as Rus-
sia opposed the attack and hundreds of thousands of antiwar 
protestors repeatedly took to the streets throughout the world 
for the weeks and months preceding and following the onset 
of war launched by the coalition forces of the United Kingdom 
and the United States.
Though the West withdrew all of its troops from Iraq by 
the end of 2011, the legacy of the war persists today. For the 
United States, the war resulted in 4,459 deaths. Another dis-
tressing and long-term aspect of the Iraq war, as well as other 
U.S. wars, is its impact on returning veterans' mental health; 
the Department of Veteran Affairs director has stated that there 
are about 1,000 suicide attempts per month among the nation's 
25 million veterans (from all U.S. wars). Besides the mental 
health impacts, there are, of course, also very significant physi-
cal ones, including lost limbs and serious brain and organ inju-
ries. The U.S. Treasury estimates the direct cost of the war at 
$845 billion. Nobel-prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz 
and his coauthor Linda Bilmes argue that the true cost of the 
war is closer to $3 trillion when the indirect costs are also

Corruption can be defined in a number of ways but a simple definition 
 provides the most insight into the variety of its expression as well as its ef-
fects. Corruption is any abuse of a position of trust (in either the public or 
private sector) in order to gain an unfair advantage. Corrupt actions include 
a wide range of activities from accepting bribes or gifts to manipulating elec-
tions, laundering money, or defrauding investors. These different forms are 
 frequently categorized as different degrees of corruption.
■ Petty corruption includes small acts of abuse such as small gifts or using 
personal connections to obtain favors. This form of corruption often 
happens where poorly paid officials take bribes to supplement their 
incomes.
■ Grand corruption occurs at the highest levels of government often in 
those countries ruled by dictators or where the policing apparatus is 
weak. Rich countries are not immune from grand corruption, however.
▼ Figure 10.D Global Corruption Perception This graph links  
perceptions of public sector corruption to unemployment and inflation. 
Black lettering along the horizontal axis shows a country's GDP. The scale 
goes from 0 (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean). 
■ Systemic corruption is such that corruption has become the rule rather 
than the exception to it. This form of corruption happens when there is a 
lack of transparency in governing or where there is a culture of impunity.
The spatial unevenness of corruption reflects the fact that corruption is most 
likely to occur in countries besieged by conflict and poverty. While the 
correspondence is not perfect, data suggests the poorer 
the country the higher the level of corruption, or at least, 
according to the corruption watch organization Transpar-
ency International, perceptions of corruption are highest in 
countries with the greatest percentage of very poor peo-
ple or people in highly insecure situations (Figure 10.D).

country capturing cities and surrounding territory. Discrimina-
tion against Sunnis since the fall of Saddam Hussein enabled 
this Sunni jihadist militia group to consolidate and gain sup-
port. And though al-Qaeda has distanced itself from ISIS, the 
group does adhere to al-Qaeda's global jihadist principles 
including anti-Westernism, strict interpretation of Islam, and 
the promotion of brutal religious violence against Shia Mus-
lims and Christians and videotaped beheadings of Westerners.
The aim of ISIS is to return to an earlier, and they would say 
more pure, period of Islam by establishing its own rule through 
conquered territory. On June 24, 2014, after securing a significant 
stretch of territory, a caliphate—an Islamic state led by a Mus-
lim religious and political leader—was declared with Abu Bakr 
al-Baghdi as its caliph (Figure 10.26). The keys to the success of 
the Islamic state are said by experts to be its military acumen, its 
production of effective propaganda and control of social media, 
particularly Twitter, its ability to raise a significant war chest 
accounted for, including interest on the debt raised to fund the 
war, the rising cost of oil, health care costs for returning veter-
ans, and the cost of replacing destroyed military hardware and 
degraded operational capacity (Figure 10.25).1

For Iraq, somewhere between 100,000 and 110,000 com-
bined Iraqi civilian and military deaths occurred due to the 
war. Despite the fact that "major combat" has ended, peace 
has not returned to Iraq. In fact, the country is experiencing 
a dramatic resurgence of conflict as the Islamic State of Iraq 
and Syria (ISIS) has moved through the northern part of the

achieving goals that could otherwise be blocked by interna-
tional boundaries. These goals include the freer flow of goods 
and information and more cooperative management of shared 
resources, such as water.
Transnational Political Integration
Perhaps the best-known international organization operating  
today is the United Nations (Figure 10.27). The period since 
World War II has seen the rise and growth not only of large 
international organizations but also of new regional arrange-
ments. These arrangements vary from local ones, such as the 
Swiss-French cooperative management of Basel-Mulhouse air-
port, to more extensive ones, such as the North American Free 
Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which joins Canada, the United 
States, and Mexico into a single trade region.
Regional organizations and arrangements now address 
a wide array of issues, including the management of inter-
national watersheds and river basins, such as the Great 
Lakes of North America and the Danube and Rhine rivers 
in Europe. They also oversee the maintenance of health and 
sanitation standards and coordinate regional planning and 
tourism. Such regional arrangements seek to overcome the 
barriers to the rational solution of shared problems posed 
by international boundaries. They also provide larger arenas 
for the pursuit of political, economic, social, and cultural 
objectives.

Globalization, Transnational Governance, 
and the State
As we have already noted, globalization has been as much 
about restructuring geoeconomics as it has been about 
reshaping geopolitics. In fact, some globalization scholars 
believe that the impact of globalization on politics has been 
so profound that globalization is leading to the diminution 
of the powers of the modern state, if not its ultimate disap-
pearance. These scholars believe that because the modern 
state is organized around a bounded territory and because 
globalization is creating a new economic space that is trans-
national, the state is increasingly incapable of responding to 
the needs of the new transnational economy. Although we 
do not subscribe to this position, we do recognize that the 
state is undergoing dramatic changes that are restructuring 
its role with respect to both local, domestic concerns as well 
as global, transnational ones.
Supranational organizations A collection of individ-
ual states with a common goal that may be economic and/
or political in known as a supranational organization. By 
organizing and regulating designated operations of the indi-
vidual member states, these organizations diminish, to some 
extent, individual state sovereignty in favor of the collective 
interests of the entire membership. For example, at the end 
of World War II, European leaders realized that Europe's frag-
mented state system was insufficient to the demands and lev-
els of competition coalescing within the world political and 
economic system. They responded by creating an entity that 
would preserve important features of state sovereignty and 
identity. They also intended to create a more efficient intra-
European marketing system and an entity more competitive 
in global transactions.
Figure 10.28 shows the original member countries of the 
European Economic Community, which evolved into the EU 
in 1992, the existing members of the EU, and those countries 
that are currently candidates for admission. The EU holds elec-
tions, has its own parliament and court system, and decides 
whether and when to allow new members to join. Generally 
speaking, the EU aims to create a common geographical space 
within Europe in which goods, services, people, and informa-
tion move freely and in which a single monetary currency pre-
vails. Whether an EU foreign policy will ever be accomplished 
remains to be seen, but a common European currency, the euro, 
has been in circulation since 2002.
The Decline of the Superpower? In the twentieth cen-
tury, from the end of World War II until 1989, when the Berlin 
Wall was dismantled, world politics was organized around two

HUMAN GEOGRAPHY   Places and Regions in Global Context
effectively. In fact, what the increasing importance 
of transnational flows and connections—from flows 
of capital to flows of migrants—indicates is that 
the state is less a container of political or economic 
power and more a site of flows and connections.
 International Regimes As flows and connec-
tions multiply, contemporary globalization has 
made possible a steadily shrinking world. In short, 
politics can move beyond the confines of the state 
into the global political arena, where rapid com-
munications enable complex supporting networks 
to be developed and deployed, facilitating interac-
tion and decision making. One indication of the 
increasingly global nature of politics outside of 
formal political institutions is the rise of environ-
mental organizations whose purview and member-
ship are global, as discussed in Chapter 4.
What is interesting about the institutionaliza-
tion of global politics is that it has been less involved with 
the traditional preoccupations of relations between states and 
military security issues and more involved with issues of eco-
nomic, ecological, and social security. The massive growth in 
flows of trade, foreign direct investment, financial commodi-
ties, tourism, migration, crime, drugs, cultural products, and 
ideas has been accompanied by the emergence and expansion

for the establishment of a common currency, the euro, which 
is currently in circulation among all of the original 12 members 
except Denmark and the United Kingdom. Newer members, 
including Finland, Austria, Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Malta, 
also use the euro in addition to their own currencies.

superpowers. The capitalist West rallied around the United 
States, and the communist East around the Soviet Union. But 
with the fall of the Berlin Wall signaling the "end of commu-
nism," the bipolar world order came to an end. The concept 
of the new world order, organized around global capitalism, 
emerged and has increasingly solidified around a new set of 
political powers and institutions, which have recast the role of 
the state.
The increasing importance of trade-facilitating organi-
zations, such as the EU, NAFTA, the Association of South-
east Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries (OPEC), and the World Trade Organization 
(WTO), is the most telling indicator that the world, besides 
being transformed into one global economic space, is 
also experiencing global geopolitical transformations 
(Figure 10.29). These organizations are unique in 
modern history, as they aim to treat the world 
and different regional clusters as seamless 
trading areas free of the rules that ordinarily 
regulate national economies.
The state must now contend with a 
whole new set of processes and other impor-
tant political actors on the international 
stage as well as within its own territory. For 
instance, the transnational financial network 
that was established in the 1980s is far beyond 
the control of any one state, even a very pow-
erful state like the United States, to regulate 

CHAPTER 10   Political Geographies   403
against the treaty to establish the ICC. These were the United 
States, China, Iraq, Israel, Libya, Qatar, and Yemen.
An example of global human rights legislation is the UN 
Declaration on Rights of Indigenous People, approved in 2007 
when 143 countries voted for it; 11 countries abstained; and 
four—Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States, 
of global and regional institutions to manage and regulate 
these flows. The modern state has been drawn increasingly 
into this complex of global, regional, and multilateral systems 
of governance. And as the state has been drawn into these 
new activities, it has shed or deemphasized some of its previ-
ous responsibilities, such as maintenance of social welfare.
The involvement of the state in new global activities, the 
growth of supranational and regional institutions and organiza-
tions, the critical significance of transnational corporations to 
global capital, and the proliferation of transnational social 
movements and professional organizations are captured by 
the term international regime. The term reflects the fact 
that the arena of contemporary politics is now international, 
so much so that even city governments and local interests 
groups—from sister-city organizations to car clubs—are 
making connections and conducting their activities both 
within and beyond the boundaries of their own states. An 
example of this is the human rights movement that has 
gained ascendancy over the last four to five decades.
Human Rights Human rights, including the rights to 
justice, freedom, and equality, are considered by most 
societies to belong automatically to all people. Until 
World War II, safeguarding human rights was the prov-
enance of states whose rules and regulations legislated 
the proper treatment of its citizens, from schoolchildren 
to prisoners. Since the late 1940s and 1950s, nearly all 
states have come to accept the importance of a compre-
hensive political and legal framework that focuses on 
human rights and that allows an international organiza-
tion to intervene in the operations of a sovereign state that 
is in violation of the International Bill of Human Rights 
adopted by the United Nations in 1948 (Figure 10.30).
In 1998, the United Nations realized another step in the 
protection of human rights by adopting a treaty to establish a 
permanent International Criminal Court (ICC). In establish-
ing the court, Kofi Anan, then secretary-general of the United 
Nations, stated: "Our hope is that, by punishing the guilty, the 
ICC will bring some comfort to the surviving victims and to 
the communities that have been targeted. More important, we 
hope it will deter future war criminals, and bring nearer the 
day when no ruler, no State, no junta and no army anywhere 
will be able to abuse human rights with impunity." By form-
ing the treaty, the United Nations aimed to create a permanent 
mechanism to bring to justice the perpetrators of such crimes 
as genocide, ethnic cleansing, and sexual slavery and put an 
end to the impunity so often enjoyed by those in positions  
of power.
The court has the mandate to try individuals, not states, 
for crimes committed in the present (after July 2002). What 
makes the ICC unique is the principle of complementarity, 
which means that the court can only exercise its jurisdic-
tion when a national court is unable or unwilling to genu-
inely do so itself. Thus, the importance of the international 
system has increased over the last 50 years of the twentieth 
century and appears likely to continue to do so into the 
twenty-first century. It is important to note, however, that 
not all states support the ICC. Seven UN members voted

HUMAN GEOGRAPHY   Places and Regions in Global Context
The Two-Way Street of Politics  
and Geography
Political geography can be viewed according to two contrasting 
orientations. The first orientation sees it as the politics of geog-
raphy. This perspective emphasizes that geography—the areal 
distribution/differentiation of people and objects in space—
has a very real and measurable impact on politics. Regional-
ism, sectionalism, and irredentism illustrate how geography 
shapes politics. This politics-of-geography orientation is also a 
reminder that politics occurs at all levels of the human experi-
ence, from the international order down to the neighborhood, 
household, and individual body.
The second orientation sees political geography as the 
geography of politics. This approach analyzes how politics—
the tactics or operations of the state—shapes geography. Mack-
inder's heartland theory and the domino theory, discussed 
earlier in this chapter, attempt to explain how the geography 
of politics works at the international level. In the heartland 
theory, the state expands into new territory to relieve popula-
tion pressures. In the domino theory, as communism seeks new 
members, it expands geographically to incorporate new terri-
tories. As an example of the geography-of-politics orientation, 
consider Palestine and Israel. An examination of a series of 
maps of Palestine/Israel since 1923 reveals how the changing 
geography of this area is a response to changing international, 
national, regional, and local politics.
The Politics of Geography
Territory is often regarded as a space to which a particular 
group attaches its identity. Related to this concept of territory 
is the notion of self-determination, which refers to the right of 
a group with a distinctive politico-territorial identity to deter-
mine its own destiny, at least in part, through the control of its 
own territory. The Palestinians in Israel are a prime example of 
the urge for self determination.
Self-Determination and the Israel-Palestine 
 Conflict The Israel-Palestine conflict is a modern territorial 
dispute with its roots in post-World War I colonial politics. 
Under the auspices of the League of Nations, the British gov-
ernment assumed control of Palestine and its population in 
1923, marking the beginning of the British Mandate of Pales-
tine, which included the areas of Trans-Jordan and Palestine. 
Within the borders of the Palestine mandate, the conflict began 
to take shape. Figure 10.31 maps out how subsequent conflicts 
have created territorial changes over time.
Subsequent to the mandate period, three particular 
events stand out as defining moments for the geopolitical 
shape of the former territory of Palestine and contemporary 
Israel: the 1947 U.N. Partition Plan, the Palestine War of 
1948, and the Six-Day War in 1967. For more details on these 
events, refer to the time line of the conflict in Figure 10.32. 
At its very core, the conflict is between the Israelis and the 
Palestinians. On the one side, efforts by the Jewish commu-
nity to establish an exclusively Jewish state in Palestine have 
all countries with very significant numbers of indigenous peo-
ple—voted against it. The declaration emphasizes the rights 
of indigenous peoples to maintain and strengthen their own 
institutions, cultures, and traditions and development in keep-
ing with their own needs and aspirations. It also prohibits dis-
crimination against them and promotes their full and effective 
participation in all matters that concern them. The four "no" 
voting countries expressed concern about the vague language 
of the declaration and the impact this might have on existing, 
already settled treaties.
Children's Rights An additional and often overlooked aspect 
of human rights is children's rights. In 1989, the United Nations 
adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and despite 
the convention's nearly universal ratification (only the United 
States and Somalia have not ratified it), many of the most basic 
rights of children are still not being protected. The convention 
promises to support children's rights around the world—the 
fundamental rights to life, liberty, education, and health care. 
Among the fundamental safeguards the convention provides 
are protection of children in armed conflict; protection from 
discrimination; protection from torture or cruel, inhuman, or 
degrading treatment or punishment; protection within the jus-
tice system; and protection from economic exploitation.
And yet, despite the existence of the convention, around 
the world street children are killed or tortured by police, 
recruited or kidnapped to serve as soldiers in military forces or 
labor under extremely difficult conditions, forced into prosti-
tution, and imprisoned. Refugee children, often separated from 
their families, are vulnerable to exploitation, sexual abuse, and 
domestic violence. Keeping the promises made in the Conven-
tion on the Rights of the Child is one of the biggest challenges 
of the twenty-first century.
The emergence of human rights as a globally relevant issue 
has occurred as groups and organizations, both governmental 
and nongovernmental, have been able to debate and discuss 
issues that concern all people everywhere and can do so at the 
international level through conferences, e-mail, listservs, and 
direct action at international events. The phenomenon of dif-
ferent people and groups across the world in common cause is 
known as global civil society. Global civil society is composed 
of the broad range of institutions that operate between the pri-
vate market and the state.

ties? What would be the consequences of such international 
efforts on citizenship, sovereignty, and democracy?

inseparable from Palestinian efforts to resist the Israeli military 
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
The Palestinians' passionate desire for self-determination 
coupled with Israel's security needs make political negotia-
tions at the governmental level complex, protracted, and emo-
tionally loaded. The upwelling of violence in 2014 in Israel 
and Palestine is evidence of this.
The kidnapping and subsequent killing of three male 
teenagers living in an illegal (according to international 
law) Jewish settlement in the Palestinian West Bank is 
assumed to have been conducted by Hamas, a militant 
organization founded to liberate Palestine from the Israeli

state of Israel. On the other side, the Palestinian community 
continues to struggle against the effects of displacement and 
colonization and remains committed to the founding of an 
independent Palestinian state.
The conflict is essentially about land. Currently, Israel 
controls over 75 percent of former Palestine; this includes a 
military and settler occupation of the West Bank. Israel also 
controls land, sea, and flight access to the Gaza Strip. Despite 
this external control, Palestinians remain firmly engaged 
in a national project of establishing their own independent 
state in the remaining 25 percent of the land. This struggle is

by Israel have produced the changing geographies we see here. Importantly, at a smaller scale, of Israel today would not show continuous regions

one of the poorest states in Mexico, the EZLN opposes the 
Mexican federal state and its embrace of corporate globaliza-
tion, arguing that it oppresses them by denying the peasant 
way of life. A key element of the Zapatista ideology is their 
aspiration to practice politics in a truly participatory way, from 
the "bottom-up," by guaranteeing the right of indigenous peo-
ples to form and govern their own municipalities traditionally. 
In doing so, the Zapatistas reject official authorities and elect 
their own at the same time that they refuse federal government 
involvement and control. The Zapatistas have been building 
this autonomous form of governing since 1994 with dramati-
cally beneficial results for community health, education, hous-
ing, and general welfare.
We need only look at the long list of territorially based 
conflicts that have emerged in the post-Cold War world to 
realize the extent to which territorially based ethnicity 
remains a potent force in the politics of geography. For exam-
ple, the Kurds continue to fight for their own state separate 
from Turkey and Iraq (Figure 10.33). A significant proportion 
of Québec's French-speaking population, already accorded 
substantial autonomy, continues to advocate complete inde-
pendence from Canada. Regionalism also underlies efforts by 
Scotland to separate from the United Kingdom and Catalonia 
from Spain to form their own states.
Sectionalism Although the two sometimes coexist, 
 sectionalism, an extreme devotion to local interests and cus-
toms, should not be confused with regionalism. Sectional-
ism has been identified as an overarching explanation for 
occupation and establish a Palestinian state. And the sub-
sequent kidnapping and murder of a 16-year old Palestin-
ian youth has been labeled a revenge attack undertaken by 
three Jewish settlers, two of them teenagers. These events 
confirm the extreme state of anger, violence, and fear that 
surrounds the Palestinian bid for self-determination and 
their own state.
Regionalism Different groups with different identities—
religious or ethnic—sometimes coexist within the same state 
boundaries. At times, discordance between legal and politi-
cal boundaries and the distribution of populations with dis-
tinct identities leads to movements to claim or reclaim par-
ticular territories. These movements, whether conflictual or 
peaceful, are known as regional movements. Regionalism 
is a feeling of collective identity based on a population's 
politico-territorial identification within a state or across state 
boundaries.
Regionalism often involves ethnic groups who seek auton-
omy from an interventionist state and the development of 
political power. The Basque provinces of northern Spain and 
southern France have sought autonomy from those states for 
most of the twentieth century. The Basque people are one of 
the oldest European peoples, with a distinctive culture and 
language.
Another separatist movement is the EZLN (Ejército 
Zapatista de Liberación Nacional), the Zapatista Army of Liber-
ation, which practices a different type of revolutionary auton-
omy. Composed largely of indigenous peasants from Chiapas, 
▶ Figure 10.33 Kurdistan The "Land of 
the Kurds" is a geocultural region that refers 
to parts of eastern Turkey, northern Iraq, 
northwestern Iran and northeastern Syria,

would like to see this area become the  
territorial basis for an independent nation-
state where Kurds would constitute a  
majority.

commonality, such as ethnicity, or on prior 
historical possession is known as irreden-
tism. There are many examples of irredentism 
around the globe, including Bolivia's claim to 
land that was ceded to Chile during the war 
of the Pacific (1883) (which left Bolivia land-
locked), as well as Macedonia, which pro-
motes the view that all ethnic Slavs must be 
joined together through a United Macedonia 
claiming parts of Greece, Bulgaria, Albania, 
and Serbia.
The most recent example of irredentism 
that was acted on successfully was Russia's 
claim to the Crimean Peninsula, until Febru-
ary 2014. Russia occupied and later declared 
Crimea to be part of the Russian Federation 
and is currently administering the area from 
Moscow. The newly claimed Russian state 
of Crimea has not yet been recognized by 
the UN General Assembly or by many countries including the 
United States. The situation in Ukraine and Russia's aggression 
there is being widely recognized by political experts as the  
emergence of a new Cold War.

movement, what its aims are, how long the movement has been 
active, and any other information you feel is pertinent. Describe 
the role territory and power play in the aims of the group you

The Geography of Politics and 
Geographical Systems of Representation
An obvious way to show how politics shapes geography is 
to demonstrate how systems of political representation are 
geographically anchored. For instance, the United States 
has a political system in which democratic rule and terri-
torial organization are linked by the concept of territorial 
representation.
Electoral divisions Democratic rule describes a system 
in which public policies and officials are directly cho-
sen by popular vote. Territorial organization is a system 
of government formally structured by area, not by social 
groups. Thus, voters vote for officials and policies that will 
represent them and affect them where they live. The terri-
torial bases of the U.S. system of representation are illus-
trated in Figure 10.35. The United States is a federation of 
50 states, which are subdivided into over 3,000 counties or 
parishes. Counties and parishes are further broken down 
the U.S. Civil War. It was an attachment to the institution 
of slavery and to the political and economic way of life 
slavery made possible that prompted the southern states to 
secede from the Union. Although the Civil War was waged 
around the real issue of permitting or prohibiting slavery, it 
also involved disagreement over the power of the states. The 
Union went to war to ensure that sectional interests would 
not take priority over the unity of the whole and states' 
rights would not undermine the power of the federal gov-
ernment. As Figure 10.34 illustrates, the election of Abraham 
Lincoln to the presidency in 1860 reflected the sectionalism 
that dominated the country: He received no support from 
slave states.
The politics of geography, in terms of sectionalism, also 
finds strong focus today in rural versus urban politics. In 
France, for example, attitudes about birth control (and birth 
rates themselves) are significantly different between the 
urbanized north of the country and the more rural south. In 
England and Wales, a rural-versus-urban conflict over fox-
hunting persists. In the countryside, foxhunting is largely 
seen as a ritual of upper class rural life. In the early 2000s, 
a largely urban constituency of animal welfare proponents 
opposed foxhunting and pressured the government to act to 
protect the foxes. The result was the Hunting Act of 2004 
that made it illegal to hunt a mammal using a dog. The act 
pitted a group called the Countryside Alliance, which con-
tinues to seek repeal of the act, against animal rights activ-
ists, mostly headquartered in large British cities, and the 
London-based Parliament.

ritories administered by another state on the grounds of 
▲ Figure 10.34 The 1860 presidential election The U.S. presidential 
election of 1860 graphically illustrates the role sectionalism plays in deter-
mining who gets votes from which geographical regions. In a four-way race,

nation's most populous states, as Barack Obama did in 2008 
and 2012. 
Other systems of representation exist throughout the 
world. Many electoral systems are based on representing spe-
cial constituencies in the legislative branch of government. In 
Pakistan, for example, there are four seats for Christians, four 
seats for Hindus and people belonging to the scheduled castes, 
and one seat each for the Sikh, Buddhist, and Parsi commu-
nities. Systems of representation are very much tied to the 
history of a country, with some very sensitive to the way that 
history and geography (who lives where) come together. These 
systems are both a product of and an important influence on 
the political culture of a country.
Reapportionment and Redistricting The U.S. Con-
stitution determines the allocation of legislators among 
states, guaranteeing each state a representative system of 
government. For U.S. presidential and senatorial elections, 
candidates are elected at large within each state, not on the 
basis of electoral districts. U.S. representatives, however, are 
elected from congressional districts of roughly equal popula-
tion size. This is also the case for state senators, represen-
tatives, and, often, other elected officials, from city council 
members to school board members. It is the responsibility of 
each state's legislature to create the districts that will elect 
most federal and state representatives. Other levels of gov-
ernment—from counties to special districts—also establish 
their own electoral districts. The result is that representa-
tives are elected at any number of levels of government in a 
collection of districts that is complicated, extensive, and by 
no means systematic.
Problems of the proper "fit" between political representa-
tion and territory emerge when population changes. Because 
most forms of representation are based on population, it often 
becomes necessary to change electoral district boundaries to 
distribute the total population more evenly among districts. 
Reapportionment is the process of allocating electoral seats to 
geographical areas. Redistricting is the defining and redefining 
of territorial district boundaries. For example, the number of 
congressional representatives in the United States as a whole is 
fixed at 435. These 435 seats must be reapportioned in accor-
dance with population change every 10 years. (Recall from  
Chapter 3 that the federal government is required to count the 
U.S. population every 10 years. One of the chief reasons for 
this is to maintain the proper match between population and 
representation.) Both reapportionment and redistricting are 
political, geographical, and statistical exercises. As geographer 
Richard Morrill writes:
The process is political in that the design and ap-
proval of systems of districts is usually done by bod-
ies of elected representatives; the balance of power 
between groups and areas is often involved; identi-
fication of citizens with a traditional electoral terri-
tory is altered; and the incumbency of individuals is 
usually at stake... . The process is geographic in that 
into municipalities, townships, and special districts, which 
include school districts, water districts, library districts, 
and others.
The electoral divisions established for choosing elected 
officials in the United States range from precincts and 
wards to congressional districts and states. State power is 
applied within geographical units, and state representa-
tives are chosen from geographical units. The bottom line is 
that in the United States—as in many other representative 
democracies—politics is geography. People and their inter-
ests gain representation in government through the location 
of their interests in particular places and through their rel-
ative ability to capture political control of geographically 
based political units.
For example, election of the president involves a popular 
vote carried out at the precinct level but totaled at the state 
level. Thus, even though particular precincts, cities, or coun-
ties may vote for one candidate over another, if the majority 
of votes at the state level supports the opposing candidate, 
then that person is declared the winner in that state. The 
president is not elected by the popular vote, but by the elec-
toral college.
Electoral college The United States possesses a unique 
political-geographic body known as the electoral college com-
posed of a specified number of delegates allocated to each state 
based on that state's population as of the most recent official 
census. In short, it is the state-level voting tally that drives the 
process. A candidate may win the countrywide popular vote 
but lose in the electoral college if that candidate fails to win 
enough states to secure the required majority of the electoral 
votes (Figure 10.36). The geographical implications of the U.S. 
presidential voting arrangement are crucial to candidates' cam-
paign strategies. To be a winner requires concentrating time 
and energy on capturing a majority of votes in some of the

     Each state is allotted one elector of each U.S. representative 
and senator it has. Washington, D.C., receives three electors, the 
same number of electors as the least populous state.
1
     Mostly, electors are nominated at state party conventions. The 
electors' names are given to the state's election ofﬁcial.
2
     On Election Day, voters in each state cast their ballot for the 
slate of electors representing their choice of presidential ticket. 
The electors' names do not usually appear on the ballot.
3
     The slate of electors for the presidential ticket that receives the 
most votes is appointed, and all the electoral votes for that state 
go to those candidates.*
4
     A candidate needs to win a majority of electoral votes—270—to 
be elected president. If no candidate wins a majority of electoral 
votes (see example below), the House chooses the president and 
the Senate chooses the vice president.
5
     In December, in a largely ceremonial gesture, the electors cast 
ballots for president and vice president and are expected to follow 
the popular vote of their state.
6
     The votes are counted at a join session of Congress, and the 
president ofﬁcially is elected.

Redistricting for partisan purposes is known as gerrymander-
ing. Gerrymandering involves boundaries of districts being 
redrawn to advantage a particular political party or candidate 
or to prevent or ensure a loss of power of a particular subpopu-
lation (like African Americans).
Although the Federal Voting Rights Act intended that 
redistricting enhance minority representation in Congress, a 
fine line exists between "enhancement" and creating a district 
solely to ensure that a minority person is elected. Figure 10.37 
shows North Carolina's reengineered Twelfth District, the con-
stitutionality of which was upheld by a Supreme Court deci-
sion in 2001.
APPLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE
1. Define both reapportionment and redistricting. What is the dif-
ference? How are both exercises "geographical, political, and 
statistical"?
2. Research cases of gerrymandering in your country. Show specific 
examples where electoral boundaries have been redrawn to 
divide vote-banks, to lower representations of particular groups, 
or to work towards the advantages of a particular party or candi-
date. What has been the response of the electorate and the State 
and judiciary in such cases? 
areas must be allocated to districts and boundaries 
drawn (or territories partitioned into districts); com-
munities of interest, which may have arisen in part 
from pre-existing systems of districts, may well be 
affected; restructuring of basic electoral geography 
is altered; and accessibility of voters to their rep-
resentatives or centers of decision-making may be 
changed... . Redistricting is also statistical or math-
ematical in that there is a requirement for reason-
ably current and accurate data on population and its 
characteristics and, sometimes, of property and its 
valuation.2
The U.S. Census is a driver of redistricting activities as 
population growth and geographical shifts will result in the 
redrawing of district boundaries to maintain equal representa-
tion on the basis of population so that each person's vote is 
equally weighted.
Gerrymandering The purpose of redistricting is to ensure 
the equal probability of representation among all groups.

The end of the first Cold War and the possible emergence of an-
other one, the widespread availability of telecommunications, 
the transnational reorganization of industry and finance, and 
the liberalization of trade all suggest that a new global politi-
cal and economic order is accelerating in strength and extent. 
With the rapid growth of India and China and the prominence 
of the European Union, it would seem that a multipolar world 
is emerging, one that includes the United States but may not 
necessarily be so wholly dominated by the United States. 
This new, multipolar world might come close to what Presi-
dent George H. W. Bush heralded as a "new world order." And 
while the prospects for political stability in core countries are 
likely to remain strong, for peripheral ones the future looks far 
less bright.
The prospect for increasing ethnic rivalry and conflict is high. 
For instance, despite the recent popular vote for the creation of 
South Sudan, conflict there between Muslim ma-
jority and Christian and animist minorities is still 
ongoing. Internal conflicts such as this risk escala-
tion into regional conflicts and possibly even the 
failure of states. Weak states can become hosts to 
violent drug cartels (as in Mexico) and terrorist 
groups (as in Afghanistan). While bioterrorism, the 
deliberate use of microorganisms or toxins from living organisms 
to induce death or disease is certainly a concern, the stability of 
the global collection of states especially those in the Middle East 
and Africa is also likely to remain an issue with respect to global 
capitalist stability. Peace seems scarce in the second decade of the 
twenty-first century. The Global Peace Index for 2014 shows a con-
tinuation of a seven-year trend in declining levels of peace globally  
(Figure 10.38). The world faces a range of challenges from climate 
change to political instability and without peace, it is difficult to 
foster cooperation and establish the social equity required to meet 
these challenges.

■ Express the geopolitical model of the state and explain how it 
links geography and state practices with respect to the key is-
sues of power and territory.
The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle is often consid-
ered the first political geographer because his model of the 
state is based upon factors such as climate, terrain, and the 
relationship between population and territory. Other im-
portant political geographers have promoted theories of 
the state that incorporated elements of the landscape and 
the physical environment, as well as population charac-
teristics of regions. Later scholars theorized that the state 
operated cyclically and organically. Twentieth-century 
theorists such as Foucault, Althusser, and Deleuze have 
shifted focus away from viewing the state as a set of insti-
tutions; they are more concerned with how state power is 
assembled and deployed.
■ Compare and contrast the ways that different contemporary 
theorists—from Deleuze to Althusser—approach the state as a 
political and geographical entity.
The state is also a set of institutions for the protection 
and maintenance of society. A state is not only a place, 
a bounded territory, it is also an active entity that oper-
ates through the rules and regulations of its various insti-
tutions. State theorist Louis Althusser views the state as 
both ideological and repressive. Michel Foucault, another 
state theorist, has explored the ways that power, knowl-
edge, and discourse operate to produce particular kinds of 
state subjects. Giles Deleuze sees the state as a force that 
is greater than the formal institutions that constitute it. 
Deleuze believes that the state is best thought of as a ma-
chine whose purpose is to regulate and dominate.
■ Interpret how imperialism, colonialism, heartland theory, 
domino theory, the end of the Cold War, and the emergence 
of the new world order are key examples of ways geog-
raphy has influenced politics and politics has influenced 
geography.
Geopolitics may involve the extension of power by one 
group over another. There are many different manifesta-
tions of this phenomenon. Imperialism and colonialism 
involve occupation and control by one state over another. 
Heartland theory recognizes that a central location is piv-
otal to political and geographical control, whereas domino 
theory reflects the significance of proximity in the exten-
sion of power and control. During the Cold War, blocks 
of the global political system—capitalist versus commu-
nist—were in direct and indirect conflict. The current new 
world order is a manifestation of the decline of those old 
conflicts and the emergence of new ones.
■ Demonstrate how the growth and proliferation of interna-
tional and supranational organizations created the foundation 
for the emergence of global forms of governance.
Just as states are key players in political geography, so too 
have international and supranational organizations be-
come important participants in the world system in the 
last century. These organizations have become increas-
ingly important means of achieving goals such as the freer 
flow of goods and information and more cooperative man-
agement of shared resources, such as water.
LEARNING OUTCOMES REVISITED
The globalization of the economy has been largely facilitated 
by states extending their spheres of influence and paving the 
way for the smooth functioning of markets and industries. Po-
litical geography is as much about what happens at the global 
level as it is about what happens from the region to the neigh-
borhood to the household and the individual.
Theories of the state have been one of geography's most im-
portant contributions to understanding politics. Ratzel's emphasis 
on the relationship between power and territory and Mackinder's 
model of the geographical pivot remind us that space and territory 
shape the actions of states in both dramatic and mundane ways. 
Time and space shape politics, and events distant in time and 
space—such as colonialism—continue to have impacts long after-
wards. For example, the civil war in Northern Ireland, instigated 
by English colonial practices now centuries old, has only in the 
last decade or so shown signs of ceasing. The impacts of core colo-
nization have also been felt in countries throughout the Northern 
Hemisphere, as well as by neighbors living unhappily side by side 
for several generations in cities like Belfast and Boston.
Perhaps the most significant aspect of contemporary glo-
balization is the emergence of a new world order and a result-
ing focus on terrorism as well as the growth of transnational 
institutions of governance and the increase in war. These 
forces are reshaping not only governing structures and eco-
nomic processes (creating new layers of rules, regulations, and 
policies, as well as new ways of political interaction among 
and between nation-states) but also the practices of everyday 
life (as citizens deal with increased personal security measures 
and the transformation of human rights).
The pairing of the terms politics and geography serves 
to remind us that politics is clearly geographical at the same 
time that geography is unavoidably political. The divisions 
of area into states, counties, cities, towns and special dis-
tricts mean that where we live shapes our politics, and vice 
versa. Geography is politics, just as politics is geography. And 
geographical systems of representation, as well as identity 
politics based on regional histories, confirm this interactive 
relationship.

■ Recognize how events of international political significance 
are usually the result of East/West and North/South divisions, 
whereas national and local political issues emerge out of ten-
sions related to regionalism and sectionalism and to some ex-
tent, previous experiences with colonialism.
Capitalist colonialism and imperialism were key factors 
in producing global state divisions around capitalism ver-
sus communism (East/West) and rich versus poor (North/
South). More recently, local divisions have emerged that 
reflect differences in ethnicity, political orientations, and 
economic commitments, among others. These are ex-
pressed through regionalism and sectionalism.
■ Describe the difference between the politics of geography 
and the geography of politics as manifestations of the two-way 
relationship between politics and geography.
Political geography can be viewed through two contrasting 
lenses. The first orientation sees it as the politics of geog-
raphy. This perspective emphasizes that geography—the 
areal distribution/differentiation of people and objects in 
space—has a very real and measurable impact on politics. 
The second orientation sees political geography as the ge-
ography of politics. This approach analyzes how politics—
the tactics or operations of the state—shapes geography.

exercise, you will explore the impact of a boundary on 
nationalist attitudes and behaviors. You will need to use 
The New York Times Index to complete this assignment. 
Using the United States-Mexico border as your key word, 
describe the range of issues that derive from this juxtaposi-
tion of two very different nations. Concentrate on a five-
year period, indicating which issues grew in importance, 
which issues declined, and which issues continued to 
have a consistent news profile throughout the period.
2. National elections usually tell a story about the ways re-
gional ideas and attitudes shape the political agenda. In

DATA ANALYSIS
In this chapter we have looked at different forms of human 
organization around the world and how geography influ-
ences politics and vice versa. We have also looked at what the 
"state" is and how this geopolitical model relates to power and 
territory. But what is it like to operate outside the state? What 
does it mean to have no passport or national identity and try 
to maneuver the globe?
To look closer at the realities for stateless people, go to the 
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) website 
and explore the pages on "stateless persons" to answer these 
questions.
1. Read this page and define what it means to be "stateless." 
2. What are the causes of statelessness? Hint: Look at the dif-
ferent pages connected to statelessness, like "The Causes of 
Statelessness."
3. In 2014, the UNHCR celebrated the 60th Anniversary of 
the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Per-
sons. Download the handbook relating to the 1954 Conven-
tion at http://www.unhcr.org/53b698ab9.html and read the 
introduction.
 4. According to the handbook, do most countries have ways 
of determining whether a person is stateless? What is the 
UN's criteria?
 5. Watch the story of Railya Abulkhanova, "I Am Stateless". 
 6. What is Railya's place of origin? How did she become 
stateless?
 7. What is Railya's occupation? Does her level of education 
help her stateless status? Why or why not?
 8. How does Railya describe being stateless?
 9. What are some of the challenges Railya faces as a stateless 
person?
10. How would your life change if you suddenly became state-
less? How linked is your citizenship to your identity? To 
your sense of security? To your freedom of movement in 
your country of residence and around the world?

URBANIZATION 
AND THE GLOBAL 
URBAN SYSTEM
11
Singapore is one of the success stories of the global urban  
system. From a nineteenth-century British trading post of just a thousand 
or so people, mostly indigenous Malays employed by British traders, it has 
grown to a city-state of 5.3 million. People of Malayan origin are now in the 
minority: The descendants of Chinese rubber plantation workers are the ma-
jority. There is also a minority population of Indian descent, whose presence, 
like the Chinese, was originally connected to the Malayan rubber plantations 
and Singapore's role as a gateway city, dominating trade into and out of the 
Malaysian Peninsula.
For a couple of years after independence from the British in 1963, Singapore 
was part of the new state of Malaysia. Ethnic and cultural differences with 
the Malay majority led to Singapore's expulsion, and it became a modern 
city-state of just 274 square miles: just over one-tenth the size of Delaware. 
Politically isolated, but situated at the crossroads of trade routes in Southeast 
Asia, Singapore set about creating a favorable business climate.
Singapore's initial growth was export-led, taking advantage of cheap labor and 
its extensive port facilities. Even today the costs of hourly compensation for pro-
duction workers in manufacturing industries in the city are only about 20 per-
cent of those for U.S. workers. The globalization of economic activity in the 
1970s brought significant flows of capital into the city along with the financial 
and business services that were beginning to reshape world economic geogra-
phy and, with it, the global urban system. The city met the challenges of limited 
space, few natural resources, and rapid growth by establishing a highly central-
ized planning system. The country's leadership realized that a favorable busi-
ness climate would require a highly efficient infrastructure and an exceptional 
quality of life as well as an advantageous labor and financial environment.
Today Singapore is a city of global importance. Its affluence and amenities 
have attracted talent from around the world, and its highly regulated econ-
omy and society have made it one of the safest and best integrated cities of 

420 
HUMAN GEOGRAPHY   Places and Regions in Global Context
its size. Because of the limited space and natural re-
sources of the country, urban planning has played a 
significant role, and Singapore is now considered to be 
one of the best-planned metropolises in the world. It 
has been framed around high-density residential and 
commercial developments centered on multiple trans-
port nodes. There are seamless connections between 
bus and rail services and a strict vehicle quota system 
that controls the amount of traffic in the city. There 
are cutting-edge water recycling plants and waste-to-
energy facilities, and a citywide recycling program that 
recycles 60 percent of waste. Environmental policies 
and regulations have made it one of the leading "green 
cities" in the world. Despite the rapid urbanization 
over the past 50 years, greenery still covers more than 
half of the surface area of the city, including more than 
450 public parks and gardens and four large nature re-
serves  designed to preserve its rich biodiversity.
URBAN GEOGRAPHY AND 
URBANIZATION
Urbanization is one of the most important geographic phe-
nomena in today's world. The proportion of the world's popu-
lation living in urban settlements is growing at a rapid rate, 
and the world's economic, social, cultural, and political 
processes are increasingly being played out within and 
between the world's systems of towns and cities. The trend is 
now irreversible because of the global shift to technological-, 
industrial-, and service-based economies. In this chapter, we 
describe the extent and pattern of urbanization across the 
world, explaining its causes and the resultant changes 
wrought in people and places.
Studying Urbanization
Urban geography is concerned with the development of towns 
and cities around the world, with particular reference to the 
similarities and differences both among and within urban 
places. For urban geographers, some of the most important 
questions include:
■ What attributes make towns and cities distinctive?
■ How did these distinctive identities evolve?
■ What are the relationships and interdependencies between 
particular sets of towns and cities?
■ What are the relationships between cities and their sur-
rounding territories?
■ Do significant regularities exist in the spatial organization 
of land use within cities, in the patterning of neighborhood 
populations, or in the layout and landscapes of particular 
kinds of cities?
■ What kinds of problems result from different patterns and 
processes of urbanization?
■ How do environmental factors influence the character of 
urbanization, and how might climate change affect cities?
Urban geographers also want to know about the causes of 
the patterns and regularities they find. How, for example, do 
specialized urban subdistricts evolve? Why does urban growth 
occur in a particular region at a particular time? And why does 
urban growth exhibit a distinctive physical form during a cer-
tain period? In pursuing such questions, urban geographers 
have learned that the answers are ultimately to be found in the 
wider context of economic, social, cultural, and political life. 
Towns and cities must be viewed as part of the economies and 
societies that maintain them.
Urbanization, therefore, is not simply the population 
growth of towns and cities. It also involves many other changes, 
both quantitative and qualitative. Urbanization increases the 
proportion of a country or a region's population living in cit-
ies (as opposed to villages and rural settlements). It implies an 
increase in the size of many (but not all) cities, and it implies 
changes in economic structure and ways of life. Geographers 
conceptualize these changes in several different ways. One of 
the most important of these is examining the attributes and 
dynamics of urban systems. An urban system, or city system, 
is any interdependent set of urban settlements within a given 
region. For example, we can speak of the Spanish urban sys-
tem (Figure 11.1), the African urban system, or even the global 
urban system (Figure 11.2). As urbanization takes place, ur-
ban systems reflect the increasing numbers of people living in 
ever-larger towns and cities. They also reflect other important 
changes, such as changes in the relative size of cities, changes 
in their functional relationships with one another, and changes 
in their employment base and population composition. Every 
town and city is part of the interlocking urban systems that 
link regional-, national-, and global-scale human geographies 
in a complex web of interdependence. These urban systems or-
ganize space through hierarchies of cities of different sizes and 
functions. Many of these hierarchical urban systems exhibit 
distinctive attributes and features, particularly in the relative 
size and spacing of individual towns and cities and the roles 
that individual cities play. The changing dynamics of urban 
systems have both reflected and shaped the world's geogra-
phies, as we shall see in this chapter.
Other important aspects of change associated with urban-
ization processes concern urban form, and we examine these 
in more detail in Chapter 11. Urban form refers to the physical 
structure and organization of cities in their land use, layout, 
and built environment. As urbanization takes place, not only 
do towns and cities grow bigger physically, extending upward 
and outward, but they also become reorganized, redeveloped, 
and redesigned in response to changing circumstances.
These changes, in turn, are closely related to another as-
pect of change: transformations in patterns of urban ecology. 
Urban ecology is the social and demographic composition of 
city districts and neighborhoods. Urbanization not only brings 
more people to cities, it also brings a greater variety of peo-
ple. As different social, economic, demographic, and racial 

CHAPTER 11   Urbanization and the Global Urban System   421
subgroups become sorted into different territo-
ries, distinctive urban ecologies emerge. As new 
subgroups arrive or old ones leave, these ecolo-
gies change.
Yet another aspect of change associated 
with urbanization concerns people's attitudes 
and behavior. New patterns of social interac-
tion and new ways of life in cities have given 
rise to the concept of urbanism, which refers 
to the distinctive nature of social and cultural 
organization in cities. Urbanism describes the 
way of life fostered by urban settings, in which 
the number, physical density, and variety of 
people often result in distinctive attitudes, val-
ues, and patterns of behavior. Geographers are 
interested in urbanism because of the ways in 
which it varies both within and among cities of 
different types.
Urbanization and Changing  
Human Geographies
From small market towns and fishing ports 
to megacities of millions of people, the urban 
areas of the world are the linchpins of human 
geographies. They have always been a crucial 
element in spatial organization and the evolu-
tion of societies, but today they are more im-
portant than ever.

How Urban? It is difficult to say just how urbanized the 
world has become. In many areas, urban growth is taking place 
at such a pace and under such chaotic conditions that experts 
can provide only informed estimates. Different countries use 
very different definitions of what constitutes an "urban" place. 
Some countries (e.g., Australia and Canada) count any settle-
ment of 1,000 people or more as urban; others (including Italy 
and Jordan) use 10,000 as the minimum for an urban settle-
ment, and Japan uses 50,000 as the cutoff. This, by the way, 
tells us something about the nature of urbanization itself: It is a 
relative phenomenon. In countries like Peru, where the popu-
lation is thinly distributed and scattered, a settlement of 2,000 
represents a significant center. In countries like Japan, how-
ever, with more residents, higher population densities, and a 
tradition of centralized agricultural settlement, a much larger 
concentration of people is required to count as "urban."
To get around these national differences in definitions of 
what counts as "urban," the World Bank has developed a uni-
form definition of what constitutes an urban area based on an 
"agglomeration index" that identifies an area of 1 square kilo-
meter as urban if its population density exceeds 150 and it has 
access to a settlement of more than 50,000 inhabitants within 
60 minutes by road. According to this measure, the overall 
level of urbanization in the world in 2010 was 51 percent. 
North America is the most urbanized continent in the world, 
with 82 percent of its population living in urban areas. In con-
trast, Africa is less than 40 percent urban. To put these figures 
in perspective, only 30 percent of the world's population was 
urbanized in 1950. In that year, there were only 83 metropoli-
tan areas of a million or more, and only 8 of 5 million or more 
existed; in 2010, there were 468 metropolitan areas of a million 
or more people, and 51 with over 5 million.
Currently, some 200,000 people are added to the world's 
urban population every day. It is estimated that by 2030, six 
out of every ten people worldwide will live in a city, and by 
2050 this proportion will increase to seven out of ten people. 
Almost all this urban population growth will occur in cit-
ies of developing countries. Many of the largest cities in the 
periphery are growing at annual rates of between 4 and 7 
percent. At the higher rate, their populations will double in 
10 years; at the lower rate, they will double in 17 years. The 
doubling time of a city's population is the time needed for it 
to double in size, at current growth rates. To put the situation 
in numerical terms, metropolitan areas like Mexico City and 
São Paulo are adding half a million persons to their population 
each year, nearly 10,000 every week, even taking into account 
losses from deaths and out-migration. It took London 190 years 
to grow from half a million to 10 million. It took New York 140 
years. By contrast, Mexico City, São Paulo, Buenos Aires, Kol-
kata (Calcutta), Rio de Janeiro, Seoul, and Mumbai (Bombay) 
all took less than 75 years to grow from half a million to 10 
million inhabitants. Urbanization on this scale is a remarkable 
geographical  phenomenon—one of the most important pro-
cesses shaping the world's landscapes.
The Functions of Urban Settlements Towns and cities 
are centers of cultural innovation, social transformation, and 
political change. They are also engines of economic develop-
ment. An estimated 80 percent of global gross domestic prod-
uct (GDP) is generated in cities, and the GDP of large cities like 
London, Los Angeles, Mexico City, and Paris is roughly equiva-
lent to that of entire countries like Australia and Sweden. Al-
though they often pose social and environmental problems, 
towns and cities are essential elements in human economic 
and social organization. Experts on urbanization point to four 
fundamental aspects of the role of towns and cities in human 
economic and social organization:
■ The mobilizing function of urban settlement. Urban settings, 
with their physical infrastructure and their large and diverse 
populations, are places where entrepreneurs can get things 
done. Cities provide efficient and effective environments for 
organizing labor, capital, and raw materials and for distrib-
uting finished products. It is no accident that corporations 
large and small, banks and investment houses, universities 
and research laboratories, and specialized manufacturing all 
congregate in cities. The proximity of roadways, rails, ports, 
and airports in urban areas reduce time, travel, and energy 
costs in a way that rural areas simply cannot match. In de-
veloping countries, urban areas produce as much as 60 per-
cent of total GDP with just one-third of the population.
■   The decision-making capacity of urban settlement. Cor-
porate offices, political assemblies, and government agen-
cies all typically locate in cities. This, in turn, makes cities 
great magnets for the best thinkers and innovators, and the 
most qualified managers and administrators. As a result, 
the decision-making machinery of public and private in-
stitutions and organizations are brought together, making 
cities the nerve centers of  national economies.
■   The generative functions of urban settlement. The concen-
tration of people in urban settings makes for much greater 
interaction and competition, which facilitates the generation 
of innovation, knowledge, and information. Cities are impor-
tant arenas of cultural production, seedbeds of cultural inno-
vation, centers of fashion, and the creation of taste. As Jane

CHAPTER 11   Urbanization and the Global Urban System   423
Jacobs pointed out long ago in her famous book, The Death 
and Life of Great American Cities,1 the density and diver-
sity of urban populations generate serendipity, unexpected 
encounters and "new combinations" that lead to innovation. 
Personal communications devices and social networking 
sites have enhanced the generative capacity of contemporary 
cities, but density, diversity, and face-to-face interactions are 
still important, especially in facilitating the "creative buzz" 
associated with the most vibrant and creative city districts.
■ The transformative capacity of urban settlement. The size, 
density, and variety of urban populations tend to have a lib-
erating effect on people, allowing them to escape the rigidi-
ties of traditional, rural society and to participate in a variety 
of lifestyles and behaviors (Figure 11.3). The demographic 
heterogeneity and cultural hybridity of urban populations 
contributes to an atmosphere of freedom and possibility.
APPLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE
1. Rationalize why cities are commonly understood as sites of 
progress and development.
2. Think about traditional identities and social mores around the 
world, and share examples of how the rural to urban move 
can change gender roles, career choices, arts, invention, social 
expectations, and politics.
In certain circumstances, combinations of these qualities 
 result in distinctive "golden ages," for example: Athens 500-
400 b.c.e, Rome 50 b.c.e. to 100 c.e., Florence 1400-1500, Vienna 
1780-1910, London 1825-1900, Paris 1870-1910, and Berlin 
1918-1933. Geographer Peter Hall2 has written about these and 
other cities, noting that all of them led their respective states 
or empires, which made them magnets for the immigration of 
talent. As they drew talent from the far corners of the empires 
they controlled, it made them cosmopolitan. They were all also 
wealthy trading cities. Out of trade came new ways of economic 
organization, and out of those came new forms of production. 
Perhaps the most important factor, though, was that all were in 
the process of rapid economic and social transformation. As a 
result, they were in a state of uneasy tension between conserva-
tive forces and values—aristocratic, hierarchical, religious, con-
formist—and radical values that were the exact opposite: open, 
rational, skeptical. These radical values were articulated more 
often than not by creative people who felt themselves outsid-
ers because they were young or provincial or even foreign, or 
because they did not belong to the established order of power 
and prestige. In such circumstances, the ferment of new move-
ments in the arts, new philosophies, new political ideals, and 
new cultural practices lead to "golden ages," with wealthy 
 individuals and well-funded institutions providing patronage 
for the avant-garde.
Of course, these are the extreme cases, and elsewhere it 
is not all positive. Urbanization has enormous environmen-
tal consequences, both global and local. With about half the 
world's population, cities account for two-thirds of global en-
ergy demand and a similar proportion of the world's green-
house gas emissions. Sprawling urban development consumes 
arable land and vital green spaces. The efficiency of cities as 
places of production, administration, and service provision can 
be compromised by congestion and the cost of living. Political 
ideologies, misguided policies, or structural economic change 
can make cities become places of deprivation, inequality, and 
exclusion instead of being places of opportunity and prosperity. 
Demographic heterogeneity and cultural differences can lead to 
tension and conflict instead of positive change and so on.
Nevertheless, the mobilizing and generative functions of 
cities, together with their decision-making and transformative 
capacities mean that they are, on balance, places of prosperity. 
In this context, the idea of prosperity goes beyond income and 
material possessions (see Box 11.1: "Spatial Inequality: The 
Prosperity of Cities").
FOUNDATIONS OF THE GLOBAL 
URBAN SYSTEM
It is important to put the geographic study of towns and cities 
in historical context. After all, many of the world's cities are 
the product of long periods of development. We can only un-
derstand a city, old or young, if we know something about the 
reasons behind its growth, its rate of growth, and the processes 
that have contributed to this growth.
In broad terms, the earliest urbanization developed indepen-
dently in the various hearth areas of the first agricultural revolu-
tion (see Chapter 2). The very first region of independent 
urbanism was in the Middle East, in the valleys of the Tigris and 
Euphrates (in Mesopotamia), and in the Nile Valley from around 
3500 b.c.e. (see Chapter 4). Together, these intensively cultivated 
river valleys formed the so-called Fertile Crescent. In Mesopota-
mia, the growth in size of some of the agricultural villages located 
on the rich alluvial soils of the river floodplains formed the basis 
for the large rival city-states of the Sumerian empire. They in-
cluded Ur (in present-day Iraq), the capital from about 2300 to 
2180 b.c.e., as well as Eridu, Uruk, and Erbil. These fortified city-
states contained tens of thousands of inhabitants; social stratifica-
tion, with religious, political, and military classes; innovative 
technologies, including massive irrigation projects; and extensive 
trade connections. By 1885 b.c.e., the Sumerian city-states had 
been taken over by the Babylonians and then the Neo-Babylonians, 
who governed the region from their capital city, Babylon.
In Egypt, which became a unified state as early as 3100 b.c.e., 
large irrigation projects controlled the Nile's waters for agricul-
tural and other uses, supporting a series of capital cities that in-
cluded Thebes, Akhetaten (Tell el-Amarna), and Tanis. Internal 
peace in Egypt meant that there was no need for massive invest-
ments in these cities' defensive fortifications.
By 2500 b.c.e., cities had appeared in the Indus Valley, 
and by 1800 b.c.e., they were established in northern China. 
Other areas of independent urbanism include Mesoamerica

The United Nations Human Settlements Programme has emphasized that 
prosperity means having a set of conditions that enable urban residents to 
flourish, feel happy and healthy, and in which business can thrive, institutions 
develop, and physical spaces become more integrated and diverse. The 
UN's "City Prosperity Index" is calculated to reflect:
■ infrastructure and amenities—adequate water, sanitation, power 
supply, road network, information and communications technology;
■ social services—education, health, recreation, safety, and security;
■ environmental quality—energy efficiency, air pollution;

■ equity and social inclusion—the extent of poverty and inequality, and 
civic participation in the social, political and cultural spheres;
■ income and employment that afford adequate living standards.3
The results are shown in Figure 11.A. The cities in the world's core econo-
mies are solidly prosperous; at the other extreme, a majority of African cities 
have very weak scores. Most of the Asian and Latin American cities included 
in the UN analysis fall in the middle of the index.

800 c.e.). Meanwhile, the original Middle Eastern urban hearth 
continued to produce successive generations of urbanized world- 
empires, including those of Greece, Rome, and Byzantium.
Explanations of these first transitions from subsistence so-
cieties to city-based economies differ. Most experts agree that 
changes in social organization were an important precondition 
for urbanization. Specifically, urbanization required the emer-
gence of groups who were able to exact tributes, impose taxes, 
and control labor power, usually through some form of religious 
persuasion or military coercion. Once established, this elite 
group provided the stimulus for urban development by using its 
wealth to build palaces, arenas, and monuments to display its 
power and status. This activity not only created the basis for the 
physical core of ancient cities but also required an increased de-
gree of specialization in nonagricultural  activities— construction, 
crafts, administration, the priesthood, soldiery, and so on—
which could be organized effectively only in an urban setting. 

CHAPTER 11   Urbanization and the Global Urban System   425
By 1000 c.e., city-based societies had emerged in Europe, the 
Middle East, and China, including a dozen major cities with 
populations of 100,000 or more (Figure 11.4).
These early urbanized economies were a precarious phe-
nomenon, however, and many of them lapsed into ruralism 
before being revived or recolonized. In a number of cases, the 
decline of urban systems was a result of demographic setbacks 
associated with wars or epidemics. Such disasters left too few 
people to maintain the social and economic infrastructure nec-
essary for urbanization.
▲ Figure 11.4 The most important cities in 1000 c.e. The most Important cities in 1000 c.e. were the seats of world-
empires—the Islamic  caliphates, the Byzantine empire, the Chinese empire, and Indian kingdoms. These cities had developed 
well-established civilizations with urban  systems based on regional trade and protected by strong military rule.

11.2 Geography Matters
Two cities that saved rock n'roll
Rock n'roll dead? By the early 1960s the excitement generated by the first 
rock n'roll musicians was gone and the popular music industry in the United 
States was desperately searching for their replacements. That's when the 
'British Invasion' led by The Beatles saved the day. But how did this happen? 
One city had an immense influence on this rescue: Liverpool. In the 1950s 
Liverpool had regular passenger liner services to and from New York, the 
centre of the American music business (Figure 11.B). English stewards on 
the ships came home to Liverpool with records from the US. This transfusion 
of musical material enabled a British city to rejuvenate a very American musi-
cal genre by inspiring the early Beatles. But this was just part of the story. De-
troit was making a similarly valuable contribution to the music industry. This 
great automobile manufacturing city attracted streams of migrants, especially 
from the American South, establishing a creative cosmopolitan mix of cul-
tures out of which the remarkably successful Motown Records was born. Be-
tween them, Liverpool and Detroit saved rock n'roll.
At its core this story is about two innovative music scenes arising from 
two different cities. Each music scene illustrates two key features of cities that 
enable innovation: inter-city relations (New York-Liverpool) through which 
products flow to be developed into new products; and migration flows (the 
American South to Detroit) that produce vibrant urban places where new 
products can be developed. Cities are central to economic development, as 
this example illustrates.
How economic development occurs
We often think of economic development as something that happens to 
countries. But what if countries are not the geographical units through which 
economic development is generated? The great urbanist thinker Jane Jacobs 
argues that countries are the result of military and political practices that de-
fine and maintain borders—and that economic development is a very differ-
ent process that occurs in and through cities. In other words, she states that 
countries are political entities geographically defined by their borders, while 
cities are economic entities geographically defined by their connections.
Let's look at how economic development occurs through cities. Although 
economic development is generally equated with economic growth, it is ac-
tually a specific form of growth that increases the complexity of an economy. 
We can see complexity expressed through an economy's division of labor—
the range and types of jobs in that economy. For example, a large successful 
city like New York has an immensely complex division of labor - think of 
the myriad of different jobs people do in that city. Simpler settlements, like 
a rural community, have a small range of jobs. Therefore simple economic 
growth such as doubling the output of a single factory does not qualify as 
development because it just increases old existing work: the division of la-
bor stays the same. However, starting production of a different commodity 
creates new work, which is added to the existing division of labor making 
it more complex—this is economic development, and it occurs primarily in 
cities. 
Cities and Economic Development

CHAPTER 11   Urbanization and the Global Urban System   427
Te 'buzz' of cities
Economic development occurs in cities because new work is more than 
likely to occur there due to the clustering of large numbers of people in 
a small area. This means there are innumerable contacts daily that provide 
the basic condition for generating new ideas that can be translated into in-
novations that generate new work for the city. This process is made espe-
cially dynamic through new contacts from people visiting from other cities 
(as in Liverpool) and from migrants arriving from other cultural regions (as 
in Detroit). Both provide the fertile conditions for bor-
rowing ideas to develop and improvise, generating more 
new work for the city. The end result is the city's divi-
sion of labor is enhanced— and economic development 
occurs. 
Successful economic development in a city is some-
times referred as 'buzz' — like hives of activity, success-
ful cities are perennially busy with rush hour commuters 
on area roads and railways streaming into areas of city 
work (Figure 11.C). There were once predictions that 
electronic communications would destroy these hives of 
activity since economic links can be made anywhere via 
the web (Figure 11.D). But the opposite has occurred: 
economic globalization is premised on a new age of great 
cities that are growing across the world because dense 
face-to-face communications are as important as ever for 
economic development. 
Losing—or maintaining— buzz
But not all cities can continuously generate economic 
development. Different types of economic produc-
tion come and go over time and may move to different

portance of telecommunications in contemporary cities.
locations, leaving some cities in economic decline. 
This may especially happen in cities that have just 
one or two dominant economic sectors, making a 
city's division of labor less complex. The simpler a 
city's division of labor, the more vulnerable it is to 
economic change: it can even experience economic 
'un-development'. For example, Detroit originally 
had a wide range of industries but came to be 
dominated by automotive production. So the buzz 
that made 'Motown' music was affected by changes 
in the automotive industry when foreign producers 
like Honda and Toyota became successful. These 
declining industrial cities in the US and other coun-
tries are commonly called 'shrinking cities'. 
But some large cities associated with a particular 
type of work do not decline because they maintain 
a diverse range of other vital jobs. New York, Los 
Angeles, and Washington, DC are famous for fi-
nance, cinema, and politics respectively—but each 
city retains its buzz beyond what it is famous for. 
This tells us that economic development is a dy-
namic process, and cities can only succeed through the continual renewal of 
their divisions of labor.

European Urban Expansion
In Europe the urban system introduced by the Greeks and re-
established by the Romans almost collapsed during the Dark 
Ages of the early medieval period (476-1000 c.e.). During this 
time, feudalism gave rise to a fragmented landscape of inflex-
ible and inward-looking world-empires. Feudalism was a rigid, 
rurally oriented form of economic and social organization 
based on the communal chiefdoms of Germanic tribes that had 
invaded the disintegrating Roman empire. From this unlikely 
beginning, an elaborate urban system developed, its largest 
centers eventually growing into what would become the nodal 
centers of a global world-system.
From the eleventh century onward, the European feudal 
system faltered and disintegrated in the face of successive de-
mographic, economic, and political crises. These crises arose 
from steady population growth in conjunction with only mod-
est technological improvements and limited amounts of culti-
vable land. To bolster their incomes and raise armies against 
one another, the feudal nobility began to levy increasingly 
higher taxes. Peasants were consequently obliged to sell more 
of their produce for cash on the market. As a result, a more ex-
tensive money economy developed, along with the beginnings 
of a pattern of trade in basic agricultural produce and craft 
manufactures. Some long-distance trade even began in luxury 
goods, such as spices, furs, silks, fruit, and wine. Towns began 
to increase in size and vitality on the basis of this trade.
The regional specializations and trading patterns that emerged 
provided the foundations for a new phase of urbanization based 
on merchant capitalism (Figure 11.5). Beginning with networks 
established by the merchants of Venice, Pisa, Genoa, and Flor-
ence (in northern Italy) and the trading partners of the Hanseatic 
League (a federation of city-states around the North Sea and Bal-
tic coasts), a trading system of immense complexity soon spanned 
Europe from Bergen to Athens and from Lisbon to Vienna. By 
1400, long-distance trading was well established, based not on the 
luxury goods of the pioneer merchants but on bulky staples such 
as grains, wine, salt, wool, cloth, and metals. Milan, Genoa, Ven-
ice, and Bruges had all grown to populations of 100,000 or more. 
Paris was the dominant European city, with a population of about 
275,000.  Europe stood poised to extend its grasp on a global scale.
Between the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries, a series of 
changes occurred that transformed not only the cities and city 
systems of Europe but the entire world economy. Merchant capi-
talism increased in scale and sophistication; economic and social 
reorganization was stimulated by the Protestant Reformation and 
the scientific revolution. Meanwhile, aggressive overseas coloni-
zation made Europeans the leaders, persuaders, and shapers of 
the rest of the world's economies and societies.

▶ Figure 11.5 Towns and cities of 
Europe, ca. 1350 Cities with more 
than 10,000 residents were uncommon 
in  medieval Europe except in northern 
Italy and Flanders. In the cities of Florence 
and Delft, the spread of cloth produc-
tion and the growth of trade permitted 
relatively intense urbanization. Elsewhere, 
large size was associated with administra-
tive, religious, educational, and economic 
functions.

CHAPTER 11   Urbanization and the Global Urban System   429
Colonialism and Urbanization Spanish and Portuguese colo-
nists were the first to extend the European urban system into the 
world's peripheral regions. They established the  basis of a Latin 
American urban system in just 60 years, between 1520 and 1580. 
Spanish colonists founded their cities on the sites of Indian cities 
(in Oaxaca and Mexico City, Mexico;  Cajamarca and Cuzco, Peru; 
and Quito, Ecuador) or in regions of dense indigenous populations 
(in Puebla and Guadalajara, Mexico and Arequipa and Lima, Peru). 
These colonial towns were established mainly as administrative 
and military centers from which the Spanish Crown could occupy 
and exploit the New World. Portuguese colonists, in contrast, situ-
ated their cities—Recife, Salvador, São Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro—
with commercial rather than administrative considerations in mind. 
They, too, were motivated by exploitation, but their strategy was to 
establish colonial towns in locations best suited to organizing the 
collection and export of the products of their mines and plantations.
The most important aspect of urbanization during this 
period, however, was the establishment of gateway cities 
around the rest of the world (Figure 11.6). Gateway cities serve 
as a link between one country or region and others because 
of their physical situation. These control centers command 
entrance to, and exit from, their particular country or region. 
European powers founded or developed thousands of towns 
in other parts of the world as they extended their trading net-
works and established their colonies. The great majority of 
these urban enclaves were ports. Protected by fortifications 
and European naval power, they began as trading posts and 
colonial administrative centers. Before long, they developed 
manufacturing of their own to supply the pioneers' needs, 
along with more extensive commercial and financial services.
As colonies were developed and trading networks ex-
panded, some of these ports grew rapidly, acting as gateways for 
colonial expansion into continental interiors. Into their harbors 
came waves of European settlers; through their docks were fun-
neled the produce of continental interiors. Rio de  Janeiro (Bra-
zil) grew on the basis of gold mining; Accra (Ghana) on  cocoa; 
Buenos Aires (Argentina) on mutton, wool, and cereals; Kolkata 
(India, formerly Calcutta) on jute, cotton, and textiles; São Paulo 
(Brazil) on coffee; and so on. As these cities grew into major 
population centers, they became important markets for imported  
European goods, adding even more to their functions as gate-
ways for international transport and trade.
APPLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE
1. Using the internet, find other kinds of cities, apart from gateway 
cities, which developed during the colonial period. (Hint: e.g., 
colonial hill stations in India)
2. From an atlas map, create a list of probable gateway cities of North 
America and Asia. Use the Internet to check on the early histories 
of these cities, noting their principal imports and exports. Compare 
your knowledge of a big city each in North America and Asia against 
the peaks and falls of certain types of transportation, agricultural 
products, and industries like cotton, steel, and ship-making.
In Europe itself, reorganization during the Renaissance 
saw the centralization of political power and the formation of 
national states, the beginnings of industrialization, and the fun-
neling of plunder and produce from distant colonies. In this 
new context, the port cities of the North Sea and  Atlantic coasts 
enjoyed a decisive locational advantage. By 1700,  London had 
grown to 500,000 people, while Lisbon and Amsterdam had each 
grown to about 175,000. The cities of continental and Mediter-
ranean Europe expanded at a more modest rate. By 1700, Venice 
had added only 30,000 to its 1400 population of 110,000, and 
Milan's population did not grow at all between 1400 and 1700.
Industrialization and Urbanization
It was not until the late eighteenth century, however, that 
urbanization began to become an important dimension of the 
world-system in its own right. In 1800, less than 5 percent of 
the world's 980 million people lived in towns and cities. But 
by 1950, however, 16 percent of the world's population was 
urban, and more than 900 cities of 100,000 or more existed 
around the world. The Industrial Revolution and European 
imperialism had created unprecedented concentrations of 
humanity that were intimately linked in networks and hierar-
chies of interdependence.
Cities became synonymous with industrialization. 
 Industrial economies could be organized only through the 
large pools of labor; the transportation networks; the physical 
infrastructure of factories, warehouses, stores, and offices; and 
the consumer markets provided by cities. As industrialization 
spread throughout Europe in the first half of the nineteenth 
century and then to other parts of the world, urbanization in-
creased at a faster pace. The higher wages and greater variety of 
opportunities in urban labor markets attracted migrants from 
surrounding areas. The countryside began to empty. In Europe 
the demographic transition caused a rapid growth in popula-
tion as death rates dropped dramatically (see Chapter 3). This 
growth in population provided a massive increase in the  labor 
supply throughout the nineteenth century, further boosting 
the rate of urbanization, not only within Europe but also in 
 Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South  Africa, and the United 
States as emigration spread industrialization and urbanization 
to the frontiers of the world-system.
During the Industrial Revolution and for much of the twen-
tieth century, a close and positive relationship existed between 
rural and urban development in the core regions of the world 
(see Box 11.2, "Visualizing Geography: The  Urbanization Pro-
cess"). The appropriation of new land for agriculture, together 
with mechanization and the innovative techniques that urban-
ization allowed, resulted in increased agricultural productivity. 
This extra productivity released rural labor to work in the grow-
ing manufacturing sector in towns and cities. At the same time, 
it provided the additional produce needed to feed growing 
urban populations. The whole process was further reinforced 
by the capacity of urban labor forces to produce agricultural 
tools, machinery, fertilizer, and other products that made for 
still greater increases in agricultural productivity. This kind 
of urbanization is a special case of cumulative causation (see 
Chapter 7), in which a spiral buildup of advantages is enjoyed 
by particular places as a result of the development of external 
economies, agglomeration effects, and localization economies.

Panama City, founded 
by the Spanish in 
1519, became the 
gateway for gold and 
silver on its way by 
galleon to Spain.
Nagasaki was the only 
port that feudal Japanese 
leaders allowed open to 
European traders, and for 
more than 200 years 
Dutch merchants held a 
monopoly of the 
import-export business 
through the city.
Guangzhou was the ﬁrst 
Chinese port to be in 
regular contact with 
European traders—ﬁrst 
Portuguese in the 
sixteenth century and 
then British in the 
seventeenth century.
Singapore, The British 
East India Company 
established Singapore as 
a trading post in 1819, 
and later became the 
chief port for exports from 
Malaysian rubber 
plantations. It was also 
the main British naval 
base in Southeast Asia.
Salvador, Brazil, was 
the landfall of the 
Portuguese in 1500. 
They established 
plantations that were 
worked by slave labor 
from West Africa. 
Salvador became the 
gateway for most of 
the 3.5 million slaves 
who were shipped to 
Brazil between 1526 
and 1870.
Boston ﬁrst ﬂourished as 
the principal colony of 
the Massachusetts Bay 
Company, exporting furs 
and ﬁsh and importing 
slaves from West Africa, 
hardwoods from central 
America, molasses from 
the Caribbean, 
manufactured goods 
from Europe, and tea 
(via Europe) from South 
Asia.
New York, at ﬁrst a 
modest Dutch fur-trading 
port, became the 
gateway for millions of 
European immigrants 
and for a large volume of 
U.S. agricultural and 
manufacturing exports.
Havana was founded and 
developed by the Spanish 
in 1515 because of its 
excellent harbor. It was 
used as the assembly 
point for annual convoys 
returning to Spain.
Mombasa (in present-day 
Kenya) was already a 
signiﬁcant Arab trading 
port when Vasco da Gama 
visited it in 1498 on his 
ﬁrst voyage to India. The 
Portuguese used it as a 
trading station until it was 
recaptured by the Arabs in 
1698. It did not become an 
important gateway port 
until it fell under British 
Imperial rule in the 
nineteenth century, when 
railroad development 
opened up the interior of 
Kenya, along with 
Rwanda, Uganda, and 
northern Tanzania.
Cape Town was founded 
in 1652 as a provisioning 
station for ships of the 
Dutch East India 
Company. Later, under 
British rule, it developed 
into an import-export 
gateway for South Africa.
Colombo's strategic 
situation on trade routes 
saw it occupied 
successively by the 
Portuguese, the Dutch, 
and the British. It became 
an important gateway 
after the British 
constructed an artiﬁcial 
harbor to handle the 
exports from tea 
plantations in Ceylon 
(now Sri Lanka).

CHAPTER 11   Urbanization and the Global Urban System   431
Manchester: Shock City The outcome was the creation of 
the modern industrial city, and nowhere was this more strik-
ing than in the emergence of Manchester, England, as the 
"shock city" of nineteenth-century Europe. (A shock city is 
seen as the embodiment of surprising and disturbing changes 
in contemporary economic, social, and cultural life. Chicago 
was the shock city of the early twentieth century, and Los An-
geles was the shock city of the late twentieth century.) Man-
chester grew from a small town of 15,000 in 1750 to a city of 
70,000 in 1801, a metropolis of 500,000 in 1861, and an inter-
nationally renowned city of 2.3 million by 1911. Manchester's 
phenomenal growth was based on new textile manufacturing 
technologies, imported cotton from Britain's colonies and for-
mer colonies, and the migration of labor from Ireland, Italy, 
and the rural regions of northern England (Figure 11.7). The 
city's first cotton mill was built in the early 1780s, and by 
1830 there were 99 cotton-spinning mills. The opening of the 
Suez Canal in 1869 halved the travel time between Britain and 
India. It ruined the Indian domestic cotton textile industry, 
but it allowed India to export its raw cotton to Manchester. 
Around the same time, British colonialists established cotton 
plantations in Egypt and Uganda, providing another source of 
supply.
Manchester was the archetypal form of an entirely new 
kind of city—the industrial city—whose fundamental reason 
for existence was not, as it was for earlier generations of cities, 
to fulfill military, political, ecclesiastical, or trading functions. 
Rather, it existed simply to assemble raw materials and to fab-
ricate, assemble, and distribute manufactured goods. Manches-
ter had to cope with unprecedented rates of growth and the 
unprecedented economic, social, and political problems that 
were a consequence of its growth.
Colonial Cities
As the example of Manchester shows, the industrialization of 
the core economies was highly dependent on the exploitation 
of peripheral regions. Inevitably, the new international divi-
sion of labor that resulted from this relationship also had a sig-
nificant impact on patterns and processes of urbanization in 
the periphery. European trade and imperialism led to the cre-
ation of new gateway cities in peripheral countries and, as Eu-
ropeans raced to establish economic and political control over 
continental interiors, these colonial cities were established as 
centers of administration, political control, and commerce.
Colonial cities are those that were deliberately established 
or developed as administrative or commercial centers by colo-
nial or imperial powers. Geographers often distinguish between 
two types of colonial city. The pure colonial city was usually es-
tablished, or "planted," by colonial administrations in a location 
where no significant urban settlement had previously existed. 
Such cities were laid out expressly to fulfill colonial functions, 
with ceremonial spaces, offices, and depots for colonial traders, 
plantation representatives, and government officials; barracks 
for soldiers; and housing for colonists. Subsequently, as these 
cities grew, they added housing and commercial space for lo-
cal peoples drawn by the opportunity to obtain jobs as servants, 
clerks, or porters. Examples of pure colonial cities are the origi-
nal settlements of Mumbai (Bombay), Kolkata  (Calcutta), Ho Chi 
Minh City (Saigon), Hong Kong, Jakarta, Manila, and Nairobi.
In the other type of colonial city, colonial functions were 
grafted onto an existing settlement, taking advantage of a good 
site and a ready supply of labor. Examples include Delhi, Mex-
ico City, Shanghai, and Tunis. In these cities, the colonial im-
print is most visible in and around the city center in the formal 
squares and public spaces, the layout of avenues, and the pres-
ence of colonial architecture and monuments.

11.1 Economic Development and Urbanization
Figure 11.1.2 Timeline of economic development and urbanization
Figure 11.1.1 The urbanization process 
in Western Europe and North America. 
The system is centered around 
agricultural productivity.
There have been several broad phases in the nature of economic development in Europe and North America, and each new phase 
called for new kinds of cities, while existing cities had to be modiﬁed. At the same time, cities themselves played important roles in the 
transformation national economies. As centers of innovation, cities have traditionally functioned as engines of economic growth.

The earliest phase of industrial development was a 
phase of competitive enterprise, characterized by 
competition among small family businesses and 
with few constraints imposed by governments or 
public authorities. The dynamism of the entire 
system rested on the proﬁtability of agriculture and 
industrial production based on mechanization, and 
intensively-used skilled labor.
By the late nineteenth century, business 
became more organized as corporations set 
out to serve regional or national consumer 
markets rather than local ones. Labor markets 
became more organized as wage norms 
spread, and governance became more 
organized as the need for regulation in public 
affairs became increasingly apparent.
After World War II, there 
was a shift away from 
industrial production and 
toward services, 
particularly sophisticated 
business and ﬁnancial 
services, as the basis for 
proﬁtability.
Increasing globalization of the economy 
since the 1970s allowed huge 
transnational corporations to move 
production and assembly operations to 
lower-cost, less developed parts of the 
world. There was a rapid decline of the 
old manufacturing base and the onset of 
a "new economy" based on digital 
technologies and business services.

Transport Networks and Urban Systems
Within the world's core regions, meanwhile, the transforma-
tion of urban systems hinged on successive innovations in 
transport technology that opened up agrarian interiors and in-
tensified intercity and interregional trading networks. The first 
phase of this transformation was based on an old technology: 
the canal (Figure 11.8). Merchant trade and the beginnings of 
industrialization in both Britain and France were underpinned 
by extensive navigation systems that joined one river system to 
another. The Industrial Revolution provided 
both the need and the capital for a spate of 
additional canal building that began to in-
tegrate emerging industrial towns. Market 
towns and hill towns that were not con-
nected to canal systems were isolated from 
commerce and immediately fell behind.
In the United States, the opening of the 
Erie Canal in 1825 enabled New York, a co-
lonial gateway port, to reorient itself toward 
the nation's growing interior. The Erie Ca-
nal was so profitable that it set off a "canal 
fever" that resulted in the construction of 
some 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles) of navi-
gable waterways in the next 25 years. But 
the scale of the United States was so great 
that a network of canals was a viable propo-
sition only in more densely settled regions. 
The effective colonization of the interior 
and the growth of American cities did not 
take place until the development of steam-
powered transportation—first riverboats 
and then railroads. The first steamboats, developed in the early 
1800s, offered the possibility of opening up the vast interior 
by way of the Mississippi and its tributaries. The heyday of 
the river steamboat was between 1830 and 1850. During this 
period, river ports such as New Orleans (Figure 11.9), St. Louis, 
Cincinnati, and Louisville grew rapidly, extending the frontier 
of industrialization and modernization.
By 1860, the railroads had taken over as the dominant 
mode of transportation, further extending the frontier of settle-
ment and industrialization and intensifying the growth of ex-
isting cities. The railroad originated in Britain, where George 
Stephenson engineered the world's first commercial railroad, a 
20-kilometer (12.4-mile) line between Stockton and Darlington 
▲ Figure 11.8 Canal systems The canal systems that opened up the in-
teriors of Europe and North America in the eighteenth century were initially 
dependent on horsepower. This example shows part of the Grand Union 
canal, in England.

CHAPTER 11   Urbanization and the Global Urban System   435
that was opened in 1825. The Rocket, the first locomotive for 
commercial passenger trains, was designed mainly by Stephen-
son's son Robert for the Liverpool and Manchester line, which 
opened 4 years later. The economic success of this line sparked 
two railroad-building booms that eventually created a highly 
integrated urban system and allowed Britain's manufacturing 
industry to flourish.
In other core countries, where sufficient capital existed 
to license (or copy) the locomotive technology and install the 
track, railroad systems led to the first full stage of urban system 
integration. Yet, while the railroads integrated the economies 
of entire countries and allowed vast territories to be colonized, 
they also brought some important regional and local restructur-
ing and differentiation. In the United States, for example, the 
railroads led to the mushrooming of Chicago as the focal point 
for railroads (Figure 11.10). This extended the Manufacturing 
Belt's dominance over the West and South. The reorientation of 
the nation's transportation system effectively ended the role of 
the South's cotton regions as outliers of the British trading sys-
tem. Instead, they became outliers of the U.S. Manufacturing 
Belt, supplying factories in New England and the Mid-Atlantic 
Piedmont. The phenomenal growth of New Orleans, which 
had thrived on cotton exports, came to an abrupt end.
In the twentieth century, the internal combustion engine 
powered further rounds of urban system development and in-
tegration. The development of trucks in the 1910s and 1920s 
suddenly released factories from the need to locate near rail-
roads, canals, and waterfronts. Trucking allowed goods to be 
moved farther, faster, and cheaper than before. As a result, 
trucking made it feasible to locate factories on inexpensive 
land on city fringes and in smaller towns and peripheral re-
gions where labor was cheaper. As we saw in Chapter 2, how-
ever, the single most important innovation with regard to the 
international division of labor—and therefore also the global 
urban system—was the development of metal-hulled, ocean-
going steamships that had vastly improved carrying capacity, 
speed, range, and reliability. The Suez Canal (opened in 1869) 
and the Panama Canal (opened in 1914) were also critical, pro-
viding shorter and less hazardous routes between core coun-
tries and colonial ports of call (Figure 2.10).

Primacy and Centrality in the Global  
Urban System
Towns and cities function as market centers and this results 
in a hierarchical system of central places. A central place is 
a settlement where certain types of products and services are 
available to consumers. Central place theory seeks to explain 
the tendency for central places to be organized in hierarchi-
cal systems, analyzing the relative size and geographic spac-
ing of towns and cities as a function of consumer behavior. A 
fundamental tenet of central place theory is that the smallest 
settlements in an urban system provide only those goods and 
services that meet everyday needs, (e.g. bakery and dairy prod-
ucts and groceries) and that these small settlements are situated 
relatively close to one another because consumers, assumed 
to be spread throughout the countryside, are not prepared to

travel far for such items. On the other hand, people are willing 
to travel farther for more expensive, less frequently purchased 
items. This means that the larger the settlement, with a broader 
variety of more specialized goods and services, the farther it 
will be from others of a similar size. The urban systems of most 
regions do exhibit a clear hierarchical structure, with many 
smaller towns, fewer mid-sized towns and cities, and a small 
number of large cities.
Urban systems also exhibit clear functional differences 
within such hierarchies. This is yet another reflection of the 
interdependence of places. The geographical division of la-
bor resulting from such processes of economic development 
(Chapter 7) means that many medium- and larger-size cities 
perform specialized economic functions and so acquire dis-
tinctive characters. Thus the industrial era produced steel 
towns (e.g., Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Sheffield, England), tex-
tile towns (e.g., Lowell, Massachusetts; Manchester, England), 
and auto-manufacturing towns (e.g., Detroit, Michigan; Turin, 
Italy; Toyota City, Japan).
The Rank-Size Rule In many countries, the functional in-
terdependency between places within urban systems tends 
to result in a distinctive relationship between the population 
size of cities and their rank within the overall hierarchy. This 
relationship is known as the rank-size rule, which describes 
a certain statistical regularity in the city-size distributions of 
countries and regions. The relationship is such that the nth 
largest city in a country or region is 1/n the size of the larg-
est city in that country or region. Thus, if the largest city in a 
particular system has a population of 1 million, the fifth-largest 
city should have a population one-fifth as big (i.e., 200,000); 
the hundredth-ranked city should have a population one-hun-
dredth as big (i.e., 10,000), and so on. Plotting this relationship 
on a graph with a logarithmic scale for population sizes would 
produce a perfectly straight line. The actual rank-size relation-
ships for urban systems at all levels of economic development 
come close to this (Figure 11.11). Over time, the slope moves 
to the right on the graphs, reflecting the growth of towns and 
 cities at every level in the urban hierarchy.
In some urban systems, the rank-size distribution is dis-
torted as a result of the disproportionate size of the largest 
(and sometimes also the second-largest) city. According to the 
rank-size rule, the largest city should be just twice the size 
of the second-largest city. In the United Kingdom,  London 
is more than 9 times the size of Birmingham, the second-
largest city. In France, Paris is more than 8 times the size of 
 Marseilles, France's second-largest city. In Mexico, the capi-
tal, Mexico City is more than 5 times the size of Guadalajara, 
the second-largest city; while Bangkok, in Thailand, is 15 
times larger than Nanthaburi, the country's next-largest city. 
Geographers call this condition primacy, occurring when the 
population of the largest city in an urban system is dispro-
portionately large in relation to the second- and third-largest 
cities in that system. Cities like London and Buenos Aires are 
termed primate cities.
When a city's economic, political, and cultural function 
is disproportionate to its population, the condition is known 
as centrality. Centrality refers to the functional dominance of 
cities within an urban system. Cities that account for a dispro-
portionately high share of economic, political, and cultural 
activity have a high degree of centrality within their urban sys-
tem. Very often primate cities exhibit this characteristic, but 
cities do not necessarily have to be primate to be functionally 
dominant within their urban system. Figure 11.12 shows some 
examples of centrality, revealing the overwhelming dominance 
of some cities within the world-system periphery. Bangkok, 
for instance, with around 10 percent of the Thai population, 
 accounts for approximately 38 percent of the country's overall 
GDP; over 85 percent of the country's GDP in banking, insur-
ance, and real estate; and 75 percent of its manufacturing.
At the global scale, the most highly centralized cit-
ies are world cities (sometimes referred to as global cities) 
that play key roles in organizing space beyond their own 
national boundaries. Recall from Chapter 7 that such cities 
have  existed ever since the evolution of a world-system in the 
sixteenth century. In the first stages of world-system growth, 
these key roles involved the organization of trade and the  
execution of colonial, imperial, and geopolitical strategies.

The world cities of the seventeenth century were London, 
Amsterdam, Antwerp, Genoa, Lisbon, and Venice. In the eigh-
teenth century, Paris, Rome, and Vienna also became world 
cities, while Antwerp and Genoa became less influential. In 
the nineteenth century, Berlin, Chicago, Manchester, New 
York, and St. Petersburg became world cities, while Venice 
became less influential.
WORLD URBANIZATION TODAY
Much of the developed world, though, has become almost com-
pletely urbanized (Figure 11.13), and in many peripheral and 
semiperipheral regions the current rate of urbanization is with-
out precedent (Figure 11.14). The dominant cities in the global 
urban system are the world cities, but they are not necessarily 
the largest. The largest cities in the global urban system, with 
populations of 10 million or more, are megacities; a few have 
become meta-cities, with populations in  excess of 20 million. 
Meanwhile, for every world city, megacity, and meta-city, there 
are thousands of large cities and tens of thousands of towns 
and smaller cities, all linked in complex  networks of trade and 
communications.
World Cities
Today, the globalization of the economy has resulted in the 
creation of a global urban system in which the key roles of 
world cities are concerned less with the deployment of impe-
rial power and the orchestration of trade and more with 
transnational corporate organization, 
international banking and 
finance, suprana-
tional govern-
ment, and 
the work 
of international agencies. World cities have become the con-
trol centers for the flows of information, cultural products, and 
finance that collectively sustain the economic and cultural glo-
balization of the world.
A great deal of synergy exists among the various func-
tional dimensions of world cities. A city like London, for 
example (Figure 11.15), attracts transnational corporations be-
cause it is a center of culture and communications. It attracts 
specialized business services because it is a center of corpo-
rate headquarters and of global markets, and so on. These in-
terdependencies represent a special case of the geographical 
agglomeration  effects that we discussed in Chapter 7. In the 
case of New York City, corporate headquarters and special-
ized legal, financial, and business services cluster together 
because of the mutual cost savings and advantages of being 
close to one another.
At the same time, different world cities fulfill different 
roles within the world-system, making for different emphases 
and combinations (i.e., differences in the nature of their world-
city functions) as well as for differences in the absolute and 
relative localization of particular world city functions (i.e., 
differences in their degree of importance as world cities; see 
Figure 11.16). For example, Brussels is relatively unimportant 
as a corporate headquarters location but qualifies as a world 
city because it is the administrative center of the European 
Union and has attracted a large number of nongovernmental 
organizations (NGOs) and advanced business services that are 
transnational in scope. Milan is relatively dependent in terms 
of corporate control and advanced business services but has 
global status in terms of cultural influ-
ence (especially fashion and 
design) and is an im-
portant regional 
f i n a n c i a l 
center.

Thus, there is a geographical complexity to world cities' 
roles that cannot be reduced to a simple "hierarchy" or rank-
ing. World cities are not simply mini-Londons and little New 
Yorks. World cities exist in networks of flows among firms 
and institutions, networks that are complex and multilayered. 
As a result world cities are connected in different ways and 
integrated to different degrees in the global urban system.
World cities also provide an interface between the global 
and the local. They contain the economic, cultural, and in-
stitutional apparatus that channels national and provincial 
resources into the global economy and that transmits the im-
pulses of globalization back to national and provincial centers. 
As such, world cities possess several functional characteristics. 
They are the sites of the following:
■ Most of the leading global markets for commodities, 
commodity futures, investment capital, foreign exchange, 
equities, and bonds
■ Clusters of specialized, advanced business services, 
especially those that are international in scope and that 
are attached to finance, accounting, insurance, advertising, 
property development, and law
■ Concentrations of corporate headquarters—not just of 
transnational corporations but also of major national firms 
and large foreign firms
■ Concentrations of national and international headquar-
ters of trade and professional associations
■ Most of the leading NGOs and intergovernmental orga-
nizations (IGOs) that are international in scope (e.g., the 
World Health Organization; United Nations Educational, 
Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO); the Inter-
national Labor Organization, and the International Federa-
tion of Agricultural Producers)
■ The most powerful and internationally influential media 
organizations (including newspapers, magazines, book 
publishing, and satellite television); news and information 
services (including news wires and online information ser-
vices); and culture industries (including art and design, 
fashion, film, and television)
■ Many terrorist acts because of their importance and 
visibility
Megacities
In contrast to the world's core regions, where urbanization 
has largely resulted from economic growth, the urbanization

CHAPTER 11   Urbanization and the Global Urban System   441
peripheral regions of the world (see Chapter 3), it has gen-
erated large increases in population well in advance of any 
significant levels of industrialization or rural economic devel-
opment. In the most massive population movement the world 
has ever seen, millions of people continue to pour out of rural 
villages each year, hoping for fresh economic opportunity in 
the world's cities.
The result, for the mainly rural populations of peripheral 
countries, has been a very different set of processes and out-
comes in terms of urbanization (Figure 11.17). Problems with 
agricultural development (see Chapter 8) mean an apparently 
hopeless future of drudgery and poverty for fast-growing rural 
populations. Emigration provided a safety valve in the past, but 
as the frontiers of the world-system closed, the more affluent 
core countries have put up barriers to immigration. The only 
option for the growing numbers of impoverished rural residents 
in peripheral countries is to move to larger towns and cities, 
where at least there is the hope of employment and the prospect 
of access to schools, health clinics, piped water, and the kinds 
of public facilities and services that are often unavailable in ru-
ral regions. Cities also have the lure of modernization and the 
appeal of consumer goods—attractions that rural areas are now 
directly exposed to via satellite TV. Overall, the metropolises of 
the periphery have absorbed four out of five of the 1.5 billion 
city dwellers added to the world's population since 1970.
Rural migrants have poured into cities out of desperation 
and hope rather than being drawn by jobs and opportunities. 
Because these migration streams have been composed dis-
proportionately of teenagers and young adults, an important 
additional component of urban growth has followed—excep-
tionally high rates of natural population increase. In most 
peripheral countries, the rate of natural increase of the popu-
lation in cities exceeds that of net in-migration. On average, 
about 60 percent of urban population growth in peripheral 
countries is attributable to natural increase.
The consequence of all this urban population growth is 
overurbanization, which occurs when cities grow more rap-
idly than they can sustain jobs and housing. In such circum-
stances, urban growth produces instant slums—shacks set on 
unpaved streets, often with open sewers and no basic utili-
ties (see Chapter 11). In general, it is the rate, not simply the 
level, of urbanization that produces slums; higher levels of ur-
banization tend to be associated with relatively fewer slums. 
The most extensive slums, according to UN statistics, are in 
the cities of sub-Saharan Africa, where over 60 percent of the 
population lives in unfit accommodations. The United Na-
tions International Children's Fund (UNICEF) has blamed "un-
controllable urbanization" in less developed countries for the 
widespread creation of "danger zones" in which increasing 
numbers of children become beggars, prostitutes, and laborers 
before reaching their teens.4 Pointing out that urban popula-
tions are growing at twice the general population rate, UNI-
CEF has concluded that too many people are being squeezed 
into cities that do not have enough jobs, shelter, or schools to 
 accommodate them.
Overurbanization, together with centrality, has been a ma-
jor contributor to the development of megacities. Megacities 
are very large cities characterized by both primacy and a high 
degree of centrality within their national economy. Their most 
important common denominator is their sheer size—most of 
them number 10 million or more in population. This, together 
with their functional centrality, means that in many ways they 
have more in common with one another than with the smaller 
metropolitan areas and cities within their own countries. 
Megacities include Bangkok, Dhaka, Jakarta (Figure 11.18), La-
gos, Manila, Mumbai, New Delhi, São Paulo (Figure 11.19), and 
Teheran. Each has more inhabitants than 100 of the member 
countries of the United Nations. Although most of them do not 
function as world cities, they do serve important intermediate 
roles between the upper tiers of the system of world cities and 
the provincial towns and villages of large regions of the world. 
They not only link local and provincial economies with the 
global economy but also provide a point of contact between the 
traditional and the modern, and between formal and informal 
economic sectors (see Box 11.3, "Window on the World: The 
Pearl River Delta: An Extended Metropolis").

Mature Metropolises
The high levels of urbanization and relatively slow rates of 
urban growth within the world's core regions are reflected 
in relatively stable urban systems. There is constant change, 
nevertheless, in patterns and processes of urbanization as the 
metropolises, cities, and towns adjust to the opportunities of 
new technologies and new industries and to the constraints of 
obsolescent urban infrastructure and land-use conflicts. New 
rounds of urbanization are initiated in the places most suited 
to new technologies and new industries. Those places least 
suited are likely to suffer spirals of deindustrialization and ur-
ban decline.
442 

CHAPTER 11   Urbanization and the Global Urban System   443
Deindustrialization and Agglomeration Diseconomies 
Deindustrialization involves a decline in industrial employment 
in core regions as firms scale back their activities in response to 
lower levels of profitability (see Chapter 7). Such adversity has 
particularly affected cities like Detroit, Pittsburgh, and Cleve-
land (United States), Sheffield and Liverpool (United Kingdom), 
Lille (France), and Liège (Belgium)—places where heavy man-
ufacturing constituted a key economic sector. Cities like these 
have suffered substantial reductions in employment since the 
1970s and 1980s when better and more flexible transport and 
communications networks allowed many industries to choose 
from a broader range of potential locations.
In many instances, deindustrialization has been intensified 
by the dampening effects of agglomeration diseconomies (Chap-
ter 7) on the growth of larger metropolitan areas. Agglomeration 
diseconomies, the negative effects of urban size and density, 
include noise, air pollution, increased crime, high commuting 
costs, inflated land and housing prices, traffic congestion, and 
crowded port and railroad facilities. They also include higher 
taxes levied to rebuild decaying infrastructure and to support 
services and amenities previously considered unnecessary—
traffic police, city planners, and homeless shelters, for example.
The result of deindustrialization has been a decentraliza-
tion of jobs and people from larger to smaller cities within the 
urban systems of core countries, and from metropolitan cores 
to suburban and ex-urban fringes. In some cases, routine pro-
duction activities relocated to smaller metropolitan areas or to 
rural areas with lower labor costs and more hospitable business 
climates. In other cases, these activities moved overseas—as 
part of the new international division of labor (see Chapter 2)—
or were eliminated entirely.
Counterurbanization and Reurbanization The combi-
nation of deindustrialization in core manufacturing regions, ag-
glomeration diseconomies in major metropolitan areas, and the 
improved accessibility of smaller towns and rural areas can give 
rise to the phenomenon of counterurbanization. Counterurban-
ization occurs when cities experience a net loss of population to 
smaller towns and rural areas. This process results in the decon-
centration of population within an urban system. This 
is what happened in the United States, Britain, Japan, 
and many other developed countries in the 1970s and 
1980s. Metropolitan growth slowed dramatically, while 
the growth rates of small- and medium-size towns and 
of some rural areas increased. In these countries, coun-
ties that for decades had recorded stable populations 
grew by 15 or 20 percent. Some of the strongest gains 
were registered in counties that were within commuting 
range of metropolitan areas, but some remote counties 
also registered big population increases.
Counterurbanization was a major reversal of long-
standing trends, but it seems to have been a temporary 
adjustment rather than a permanent change. The glo-
balization of the economy and the growth of postindus-
trial activities in revamped and expanded metropolitan 
settings have restored the trend toward the concentra-
tion of population within urban systems. Most of the 
cities that were declining fast in the 1970s and 1980s 
are now either recovering (New York, London) or bottom-
ing out (Paris, Chicago), while most of those that were grow-
ing only slowly (Tokyo, Barcelona) are now expanding more 
quickly. This trend of reurbanization involves the growth of 
population in metropolitan central cores following a period of 
absolute or relative decline in population.
Migration Drives Reurbanization Two principal kinds 
of migration are driving reurbanization in Europe and North 
America. One consists of less skilled migrants and immigrants 
from peripheral regions and countries, who move into cheaper 
central districts of major metropolitan areas because of prox-
imity to the availability service jobs. A second, very different 
migration stream consists of "baby boomers" (see Chapter 3) 
electing to pursue urban rather than suburban lifestyles. They 
tend to move into older, central neighborhoods with charac-
ter, "gentrifying" them in the process (see Chapter 11), or into 
newly-built condominiums or converted industrial spaces.
Reurbanization has also been fostered by city policies and 
real estate investments aimed at the regeneration of derelict and 
declining city districts. Regeneration involves the physical re-
development of land where the existing buildings are no longer 
useful or profitable. It often takes place on brownfield sites—
former industrial or commercial land where future use is af-
fected by real or perceived environmental contamination. 
Because of the significant costs and risks involved, urban regen-
eration strategies are usually undertaken in the form of  public-
private partnerships between city governments and real estate 
developers. Regeneration strategies take various forms. Some 
cities have focused on "high" culture and the provision of mu-
seums, galleries, theatres, and concert halls. Bilbao, Spain, has 
been very successful in this way. Some cities emphasize tradi-
tion, history, and monuments in their regeneration strategies, 
while others focus on their package of nightlife—theaters, con-
cert halls, nightclubs, cafés, and restaurants. Sports venues are 
also key to many regeneration strategies. In London, for exam-

11.3 Window on the World
The Pearl River Delta (Figure 11.E) is one of the fastest-growing urban 
regions in the world. Anchored by the major metropolitan centers of 
Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Macau, Shenzhen, and Zhuhai, it is an extended 
metropolitan region of nearly 50 million people. It is one of three extended 
metropolitan regions—Beijing-Tianjin and Shanghai are the others—that 
have been fostered by the Chinese government to be engines of capitalist 
growth since liberal economic reforms were introduced in the late 1970s.
Hong Kong (Figure 11.F) was a British colony until 1997. It is now a me-
tropolis of 7.4 million with a thriving industrial and commercial base that is 
recognized as a capitalist economic dynamo by the Chinese government, 
which has created a Special Administrative District for the metropolis. As a re-
sult, Hong Kong's citizens have retained their British-based legal system and its 
guaranteed rights of property ownership and democracy. Hong Kong is the 
world's largest container port, the third-largest center for foreign exchange 
trade, the seventh-largest stock market, and the tenth-largest trading economy.
Hong Kong's financial success encouraged the Chinese government to 
establish two of its first Special Economic Zones (SEZs) in nearby Shenzhen 
and Zhuhai. Designed to attract foreign capital, technology, and manage-
ment practices, these SEZs were established as export-processing zones that 
offered cheap labor and land, along with tax breaks, to transnational cor-
porations. Investors from Hong Kong and Taiwan responded quickly and 
enthusiastically. By 1993, more than 15,000 manufacturers from Hong Kong 
alone had set up businesses in Guangdong Province, and a similar number 
had established subcontracting relationships, contracting out assembly-line 
work to Chinese companies in the Pearl River Delta. Meanwhile, the Chinese 
government designated the entire delta region an Open Economic Region, 
where local governments, individual enterprises, and farm households enjoy 
a high degree of autonomy in economic decision making.
The relaxation of state control over the regional economy allowed the 
region's dense and growing rural population to migrate to urban areas in 
search of assembly-line jobs or to stay in rural areas and diversify agricultural 
production from paddy-rice cultivation to more profitable activities such as

market-farming activities, livestock husbandry, and fishery. Economic freedom 
also facilitated rural industrialization—mostly low-tech, small-scale, labor-
intensive, and widely scattered across the countryside. The 
area between Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Macau has quickly 
emerged as an especially important zone because of its rela-
tively cheap land and labor and because of significant levels of 
investment by regional and local governments in the transport 
and communications infrastructure (Figure 11.G).
The metropolitan cores of the region, aiming to increase 
their competitiveness and prominence in the globalizing world 
economy, have invested heavily in infrastructure improvements. 
The Guangzhou municipal government, for example, invested 
more than $10 billion between 1998 and 2004 in infrastructure 
construction—including a metro system and an elevated railway 
network to link the city's new international airport, railway sta-
tions, and port. Throughout the region, enormous investments 
have been made in showpiece infrastructure projects geared to 
the needs of local and international capital. These include major 
airports, high-speed tolled highways, satellite ground stations, 
port installations, metro and light-rail networks, and new water-
management systems. In turn, these projects have attracted 
business and technology parks, financial centers, and resort 
complexes in a loose-knit sprawl of urban development.
Today, the Pearl River Delta provides a thriving export-
processing platform that has driven double-digit annual 
economic growth for much of the past two decades. The 
region's GDP grew from just over US$8 billion in 1980 to 
nearly US$270 billion in 2010. During that period, the 
 average real rate of GDP growth in the Pearl River Delta 
Economic Zone exceeded 16 percent, well above the 
People's Republic of China national figure of 9.8 percent. 
By 2010 and with only 3.5 percent of the country's popula-
tion, the region was contributing 10 percent of the coun-
try's GDP and 29 percent of its total trade.
Guangzhou is a megacity with a 2010 population of 
around 10 million (Figure 11.H). Shenzhen has grown from 
a population of just 19,000 in 1975 to 8.1 million in 2010, 
with an additional 2 million in the surrounding municipalities. 
The southern border of the Shenzhen Special  Economic 
Zone adjoins Hong Kong, but the northern border is walled 
off from the rest of China by an electrified fence to prevent 
smuggling and to keep back the mass of people trying to 
migrate illegally into Shenzhen and Hong Kong.

Cities and Climate Change
Natural and human-made disasters have been on the rise world-
wide since the 1950s, coinciding with the rise in world urban 
population (Figure 11.21). Cities can be fragile environments, 
their concentrations of population making them vulnerable to 
natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, 
fires, and floods as well as to technological disasters. Rapidly-
growing cities in less-developed regions are especially vulner-
able. As we have seen (Chapter 4), disasters such as landslides, 
floods, windstorms, and wildland urban interface (WUI) fires 
are clearly linked to climate change, and they will almost cer-
tainly occur with greater frequency and intensity. Many urban

dwellers already live under significant risk from hurricanes, 
flooding, landslides, and drought (Figure 11.22). Coastal cities are 
at risk in addition from sea-level rise (Figure 11.23). The increase 
in volume of ocean water as it warms as a result of 
climate change is considered to be the principal 
cause of sea-level rise, but melting ice sheets are be-
coming increasingly important. The consequences of 
sea-level rise include increased storm flooding and 
damage, inundation, coastal erosion, increased sa-
linity in estuaries and coastal aquifers, rising coastal 
water tables, obstructed drainage, and changes to 
ecosystems such as wetlands, mangrove swamps, 
and coral reefs that form natural protections for some 
coastal cities.
Cities, in turn, are a major contributor to cli-
mate change. The main sources of greenhouse 
gas emissions from urban areas are related to the 
consumption of fossil fuels for electricity supply, 
transportation and industry. In the United States, 
domestic energy use accounts for between one-quar-
ter and one-third of cities' greenhouse gas emissions, 
with private automobiles accounting for a similar 
proportion. Worldwide, there is great disparity in 
the level of urban greenhouse gas emissions per cap-
ita, a direct reflection of core-periphery disparities 
in wealth and consumption (Table 11.1).
Yet while urbanization is a major contribu-
tor to climate change and its associated risks, the 
large populations, high densities, and collective wealth of cit-
ies also creates the potential for resilience to climate-related 
hazards, for example, through infrastructure developments

Gender and Vulnerability The UN Human Settlements 
Programme's report on Cities and Climate Change5 highlights 
significant differences between women and men in terms of 
their exposure to climate-related hazards, and their capacity to 
avoid or cope with or adapt to them. In general, women, espe-
cially poor women, are more likely than men to suffer injuries 
or death when a natural disaster occurs. Around 70 percent of 
the deaths resulting from severe cyclones that have battered 
the coastline of Bangladesh in recent years, for example, have

been females. There are many factors that lead to this kind of 
gender imbalance in vulnerability:
■ Women tend to experience unequal access to resources, 
credit, insurance, services, and information.
■ Women's cultural roles and caregiving responsibilities of-
ten prevent them from migrating and seeking shelter be-
fore and after disaster events.
■ When homes are destroyed or damaged, it often affects 
women's incomes more than men's as they tend to engage 
in income-generating activities from home and therefore 
lose income when homes are destroyed.
■ In the aftermath of disasters, women have traditionally 
had difficulty receiving relief aid because the need to care 
for children at home makes it difficult for them to wait in 
long lines at recovery centers.
■ The priority in disaster relief programs is often to reintegrate 
men into the workforce, and if men leave their families, as 
frequently occurs following a natural disaster, women are 
rendered ineligible for public assistance or may go unrecog-
nized by systems geared to male heads of household.
Green Cities The pace and level of contemporary urbaniza-
tion puts enormous pressure on energy and water resources, 
waste management, sewer systems, and transport networks. 
There is an increasing realization of the importance of "green" 
policies and practices that conserve resources, reduce energy 
consumption, and mitigate the human contribution to climate 
change. Because national and international protocols and dis-
cussions have had very limited success, the tasks of tackling 
climate change, avoiding lasting damage to vital ecosystems 
and improving the health and well-being of billions of people 
must be sought at the municipal level.
Not surprisingly, some of the most sophisticated ap-
proaches are to be found in the more affluent cities of core 
countries. Copenhagen, Denmark (Figure 11.24), is widely re-
garded as the most progressive large city in the world in this 
context, with aggressive goals and innovative policies. In 2009 
the city set a target to become CO2 neutral by 2025, which if 
met would make it the first large carbon-neutral city in the 
world. Almost all residents of Copenhagen live within 350 
yards of a public transport stop, and the city aims to achieve a 
significant part of its CO2 reductions through construction and 
renovation projects, with plans to upgrade all municipal build-
ings to the highest standards for energy efficiency.
Other cities that scored well on an overall "green city" index 
devised by the Economist Intelligence Unit6 and covering cities' 
CO2 emissions, energy consumption, building standards, land-
use policies, public transport, water and sanitation, waste man-
agement, air quality, and environmental governance include 
Amsterdam, Berlin, Helsinki, New York City, Oslo, San Fran-
cisco, Seattle, Stockholm, Vancouver,  Vienna, and Zurich. Mean-
while, there are many cities in the world's affluent core countries 
that score poorly on the  index—Cleveland, Detroit, Miami, and 
Phoenix, for  example—while there are some very progressive 
green cities in peripheral and semiperipheral  countries. Curitiba, 
Brazil, for example (Figure 11.25), is the birthplace of an innova-
tive bus rapid transit (BRT) system and the city established the 
country's first major pedestrian-only street. Its environmental 
policies and their oversight are consistently strong. Since 2009, 
for example, the city's environmental authority has been con-
ducting an ongoing study on the CO2 absorption rate in Curitiba's 
green spaces, as well as evaluating total CO2 emissions in the city.

The United Nations Human Settlements Program (UN-Habitat) 
estimates that by 2030, more than 65 percent of the world's 
population will be living in urban areas, and there will be 
around 575 cities with a population of a million or more, in-
cluding about 50 cities of 5 million or more. The number of 
megacities—those with a population of 10 million or more—
will increase, and the populations of most of them will swell 
significantly (Figure 11.26). The single most important aspect 
of future patterns of world urbanization is the striking differ-
ence in trends and projections between the core regions and 
the semiperipheral and peripheral regions. In 1950, two-thirds 
of the world's urban population was concentrated in the more 
developed countries of the core economies. By 2030, around 
80 percent of all city dwellers will be in peripheral and

semiperipheral countries. In 1950, 21 of the world's largest 30 
metropolitan areas were located in core countries—11 of them 
in Europe and 6 in North America. By 1980, the situation was 
completely reversed, with 19 of the largest 30 located in pe-
ripheral and semiperipheral regions. By 2030, all but 2 or 3 of 
the 30 largest metropolitan areas are expected to be located in 
peripheral and semiperipheral regions.
Asia provides some of the most dramatic examples of 
this trend. From a region of villages, Asia is fast becoming a 
region of cities and towns. Between 1950 and 2005, for exam-
ple, Asia's urban population rose more than tenfold, to over 
1.5 billion people. Half of the world's urban population now 
lives in Asia. This region has accounted for about 65 percent 
of the demographic expansion of all urban areas across the 
world since the beginning of the twenty-first- century. By 2020, 
about two-thirds of Asia's population will be living in urban 
areas. Large population concentrations in megacities will re-
main a prominent feature in urban Asia: By 2020, another three 
Asian cities—Beijing, Dhaka, and Mumbai—will join Delhi 
and Shanghai as "meta-cities," massive urban concentrations 
of more than 20 million people.
Nowhere is the trend toward rapid urbanization more 
pronounced than in China, where for decades the communist 
government imposed strict controls on where people were al-
lowed to live, fearing the transformative and liberating effects 
of cities. By tying people's jobs, school admission, and even 
the right to buy food to the places where people were regis-
tered to live, the government made it almost impossible for 
rural residents to migrate to towns or cities. As a result, more 
than 70 percent of China's 1 billion people still lived in the 
countryside in 1985. Now, however, China is rapidly making 
up for lost time. The Chinese government, having decided that 
towns and cities can be engines of economic growth within a 
communist system, has not only  relaxed residency laws but 
also drawn up plans to establish over 430 new cities.
Whatever the current level of urbanization in peripheral 
countries, almost all are forecast to experience high rates of ur-
banization, with growth forecasts of unprecedented speed and 
unmatched size. Karachi, Pakistan, a metropolis of 1.03 million 
in 1950, reached 8.5 million in 1995 and is expected to reach 16.2 
million by 2015. Likewise, Cairo, Egypt, grew from 2.44 million 
to 9.7 million between 1950 and 1995 and is expected to reach 
13.1 million by 2015. Mumbai (India; formerly Bombay), Delhi 
(India), Mexico City (Mexico), Dhaka  (Bangladesh), Jakarta (Indo-
nesia), Lagos (Nigeria), São Paulo (Brazil), and Shanghai (China) 
are all projected to have populations in excess of 17 million by 
2015. For the most part, this growth will be a consequence of the 
onset of the demographic transition (see Chapter 3), which has 
produced fast-growing rural populations in regions that face in-
creasing problems with agricultural development (see Chapter 
8). As a response, many people in these regions will continue to 
migrate to urban areas seeking a better life.
What is the most significant policy change that has con-
tributed to the growth of cities in China? Can you foresee any 
reasons why growth in peripheral and semiperipheral coun-
tries might slow in the future?

CONCLUSION
Urbanization is one of the most important geographic phe-
nomena. Cities can be seedbeds of economic development 
and cultural innovation. Cities and groups of cities also 
organize space—not just the territory immediately around 
them, but in some cases national and even international 
space. The causes and consequences of urbanization, how-
ever, are very different in different parts of the world. The 
urban experience of the world's peripheral regions stands 
in sharp contrast to that of the developed core regions, for 
example. This contrast is a reflection of some of the demo-
graphic, economic, and political factors that we have ex-
plored in previous chapters.
Much of the developed world has become almost com-
pletely urbanized, with highly organized systems of cities. 
Today, levels of urbanization are high throughout the world's 
core countries, while rates of urbanization are relatively low. 
At the top of the urban hierarchies of the world's core regions 
are world cities such as London, New York, Tokyo, Paris, and 
Zürich, which have become control centers for the flows of 
information, cultural products, and finance that collectively 
sustain the economic and cultural globalization of the world. 
In doing so, they help to consolidate the hegemony of the 
world's core regions.
Few of the metropolises of the periphery, on the other 
hand, are world cities occupying key roles in the organiza-
tion of global economics and culture. Rather, they operate 
as connecting links between provincial towns and villages 
and the world economy. They have innumerable economic, 
social, and cultural linkages to their provinces on one side 
and to major world cities on the other. Almost all periph-
eral countries, meanwhile, are experiencing high rates of ur-
banization, with forecasted growth of unprecedented speed 
and unmatched size. In many peripheral and semiperipheral 
regions, current rates of urbanization have given rise to un-
intended metropolises and fears of "uncontrollable urban-
ization," with urban "danger zones" where "work" means 
anything that contributes to survival. The result, as we shall 
see in Chapter 11, is that these unintended metropolises are 
quite different from the cities of the core as places in which 
to live and work.

CHAPTER 11   Urbanization and the Global Urban System   451
LEARNING OUTCOMES REVISITED
■ Describe how the earliest towns and cities developed inde-
pendently in the various hearth areas of the first agricultural 
revolution.
The very first region of independent urbanism, in the Mid-
dle East, produced successive generations of urbanized 
world-empires, including those of Greece, Rome, and Byz-
antium. By 2500 b.c.e., cities had appeared in the Indus 
Valley, and by 1800 b.c.e., urban areas were established in 
northern China. Other areas of independent urbanism in-
clude Mesoamerica (from around 100 b.c.e.) and Andean 
America (from around 800 c.e.). The classical archaeologi-
cal interpretation emphasizes the availability of an agri-
cultural surplus large enough to allow the emergence of 
specialized, nonagricultural workers. Some urbanization, 
however, may have resulted from the pressure of popula-
tion growth.
■ Explain how the expansion of trade around the world, associ-
ated with colonialism and imperialism, established numerous 
gateway cities.
European powers founded or developed literally thou-
sands of towns as they extended their trading networks 
and established their colonies. The great majority of the 
towns were ports that served as control centers command-
ing entrance to, and exit from, their particular country or 
region. The great majority of them were ports. Protected 
by fortifications and European naval power, they began as 
trading posts and colonial administrative centers. Before 
long, they developed manufacturing of their own to sup-
ply the pioneers' needs, along with more extensive com-
mercial and financial services. As colonies developed and 
trading networks expanded, some of these ports grew rap-
idly, acting as gateways for colonial expansion into conti-
nental interiors.
■ Assess why and how the Industrial Revolution generated new 
kinds of cities—and many more of them.
Industrial economies required the large pools of labor; 
the transportation networks; the physical infrastructure 
of factories, warehouses, stores, and offices; and the con-
sumer markets provided by cities. As industrialization 
spread throughout Europe in the first half of the nine-
teenth century and then to other parts of the world, ur-
banization increased at a faster pace. The higher wages 
and greater variety of opportunities in urban labor mar-
kets attracted migrants from surrounding areas. The 
countryside began to empty. In Europe, the demographic  
transition caused a rapid growth in population as death 
rates dropped dramatically. This growth in population 
provided a massive increase in the labor supply, further 
boosting the rate of urbanization, not only within Eu-
rope itself but also in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, 
South Africa, and the United States as emigration spread 
industrialization and urbanization to the frontiers of the 
world-system.
■ Interpret how a small number of "world cities," most of 
them located within the core regions of the world-system, 
have come to occupy key roles in the organization of global 
economics and culture.
At the top of a global urban system, these cities experience 
growth largely as a result of their role as key nodes in the 
world economy. World cities are the control centers for the 
flows of information, cultural products, and finance that 
collectively sustain the economic and cultural globaliza-
tion of the world. The globalization of the economy has 
resulted in a global urban system in which the key roles 
of world cities are concerned with transnational corporate 
organization, international banking and finance, suprana-
tional government, and the work of international agencies. 
World cities also provide an interface between the global 
and the local. They contain the economic, cultural, and 
institutional apparatus that channels national and provin-
cial resources into the global economy and transmits the 
impulses of globalization back to national and provincial 
centers.
■ Compare and contrast the differences in trends and  
projections between the world's core regions and peripheral 
regions.
In 1950, two-thirds of the world's urban population was 
concentrated in the more developed countries of the core 
economies. Since then, the world's urban population has 
increased threefold, the bulk of the growth having taken 
place in the less developed countries of the periphery. The 
world's core regions are highly urbanized, with slow rates 
of urban growth. Peripheral regions, although less highly 
urbanized, have been experiencing exceptionally high 
rates of urban growth, partly due to rural-urban migration 
and partly due to natural population increase. Much of 
the resulting urbanization has taken the form of "megaci-
ties" of 10 million people or more. Overurbanization has 
occurred where cities have grown more rapidly than they 
have been able to generate jobs or housing.

REVIEW & DISCUSSION
1. Do an Internet search on creative economy and explore its 
meanings and concepts. How do you think the concept of 
creative economy can be used for inclusive, equitable, and 
sustainable growth and development? Select two cities, 
one from the developing world and one from the devel-
oped world, where creative economy is in operation. Criti-
cally note how it makes way for inclusive, equitable, and 
sustainable growth and development. State your opinion 
as to whether or not culture can enable and facilitate the  
development process. (Hint: You can look consult the 
United Nations Creative Economy Report 2013, http://www.
unesco.org/culture/pdf/creative-economy-report-2013.pdf.)
2. Consider the term world cities. Choose two cities that you 
consider to be world cities. Now read over the functional 
characteristics of world cities that are bulleted on  
page 428. Pick two bullet points and describe the char-
acteristics in terms of the cities you have chosen. For ex-
ample, the second bullet point notes how world cites have 
"clusters of specialized, advanced business services." Do 
an Internet search and identify the clusters of specialized 
business services in the cities you have chosen.
 3. Counterurbanization refers to the process of cities losing 
population to smaller towns or rural areas. Have cities in 
your country experienced recent counterurbanization? If 
yes, list three reasons for this. Next, consider cities expe-
riencing reurbanization. List three reasons for this type of 
population movement. Compare the experiences of coun-
terurbanization and reurbanization you have listed, noting 
similarities and differences.
UNPLUGGED
1. Figure 11.14 shows the annual average growth rate be-
tween 2000 and 2010 in the proportion of people living in 
urban settlements in each country. Draw up a list of cities 
in your country that have been growing much faster than 
the average growth rate. What have been the reasons for 
their relatively rapid growth as compared to other cities in 
your country?
2. Draw up a list of cities from different administrative dis-
tricts or regions of your country. Now select a city from 
each region, and discuss differences between these cities 
in terms of the ways of living, particularly people's at-
titude, values, and patterns of behavior. Do you think the 
different ways of living have a direct bearing on the physi-
cal setting of the city? Giving examples, explore how the 
two are inter-related.
3. The following cities all have populations in excess of 2 
million. How many of them could you locate on a world 
map? Their size reflects a certain degree of importance, at 
least within their regional economy. What can you find out 
about each? Compile for each a 50-word description that 
explains its chief industries and a little of its history.

DATA ANALYSIS
As the globe becomes increasingly urbanized, 
cities are growing with disparate realities for 
their people. Look at the UN Habitat (unhabi-
tat.org) Web site to discover more about cities 
in peripheral regions of the world. Download 
the publication State of the World's Cities 
2010/2011: Bridging the Urban Divide. Read 
and answer these questions: 
1. What is the urban divide? 
2.  How are slums the product of both physical space and 
social inequalities? 
3.  What is an inclusive city and why is that important? 
4.  Choose one city in each of the three study areas of Latin 
America, Asia, and Africa to compare statistics from the re-
port's tables and graphs. Find out which of your cities is 
 
(1) the fastest in annual growth rate; 
 
(2) the most "unequal" or "equal" in income; 
 
(3) the most politically inclusive; and 
 
(4) the most culturally inclusive. 
Using the UN Habitat's data e-sources, go to the "Urban Indicators" 
to compare the countries of each of your cities for the annual slum 
population growth rate versus the annual population growth rate. 
5.  What do the data you found on both city and country  
levels tell you about urbanization processes?

CITY SPACES: 
 URBAN  
STRUCTURE
12
There is a plain building on a corner of Brick Lane, in London's 
 Spitalfields district. It was built as La Neuve Eglise (the "New Church") in 
1743 by French-speaking Protestant Huguenot refugees who had been driven 
out of France by the Catholic king Louis XIV. After the French immigrants 
began to move away from Spitalfields, the chapel closed and was taken over 
by a Methodist congregation in 1819. It became an orthodox Jewish syna-
gogue in 1898, serving Yiddish-speaking Russian and East European Jews 
who had come to London to escape the pogroms that followed the assassi-
nation of the Tsar of Russia in 1881. Today it is the community mosque for 
the  Bangladeshi population that has come to constitute three-quarters of the 
district's population.
There is little remaining evidence of Brick Lane's previous function as the 
high street for Spitalfields' Jewish community: just a couple of bagel shops 
selling salt beef sandwiches. Jewish households began to move out of Brick 
Lane in the 1950s, leaving behind inexpensive rental accommodation and a 
garment industry dependent on cheap, hard-working labor. Their place was 
taken by immigrants from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). Chain migration, 
with families from the Sylhet region of Bangladesh moving into Spitalfields 
through word-of-mouth contact with friends and relatives already settled 
there, gradually displaced the Jewish population. Today, between two-thirds 
and three-quarters of the population of Spitalfields are of Bangladeshi ori-
gin, and Brick Lane has become a tourist stop and nighttime entertainment 
strip as well as a vibrant ethnic community. It is often cited as an example 
of London's cosmopolitanism. While locals shop in sari fabric stores and 
Bengali minimarkets, outsiders frequent the curry houses, Internet cafés, 
and indie clothes and record stores. Branded as Banglatown, Brick Lane has  
Chinatown-style ornamental gateway arches along with new signage and 
new, brighter street lamps, custom-designed to incorporate "Asian" motifs.

The Bangladeshi community itself has been able to se-
cure public funding for mosques, madrassas (Islamic 
schools), and Islamic community organizations by le-
veraging its sheer weight of numbers in local elections. 
In this way, Bangladeshis and other local Muslims have 
been able to assert their own control over local space. 
The Brick Lane community now has a Bengali New 
Year Festival (Baishakhi Mela) and a two-week-long 
Brick Lane Curry Festival. Ties with Bangladesh, and  
Sylhet in particular, remain strong. Sylhet's weekly 
paper, the Sylheter Dak, a London branch office. The 
Sylhet region has meanwhile been changed by its asso-
ciation with the Brick Lane community. Sylhet itself is 
now one of the most prosperous towns in Bangladesh, 
with new shopping centers and other building projects 
funded by "Londoni" money.
Each city has its own set of internal geographies, and 
these are expressed in a mosaic of distinctive districts. 
We can recognize rich districts, poor districts, ethnic 
districts (like the Brick Lane area of Spitalfields), resi-
dential districts, commercial districts, industrial dis-
tricts, transitional districts, and many other kinds. Each 
has its own distinct character and story, the product of 
successive phases of development and of demographic, 
social, cultural, and political change. Each chapter in 
a city's history leaves its mark, for better or worse, in 
the layout of its streets, the fabric of its buildings, the 
nature of its institutions, and the cultural legacies of its 
residents. It is possible to make some generalizations 
about the nature and spatial arrangement of city dis-
tricts, though these differ in important ways according 
to the history and geography of different world regions. 
We begin by considering the characteristics of cities in 
North America.
SPATIAL PATTERNS AND PROCESSES 
IN NORTH AMERICAN CITIES
At the turn of the twenty-first century, the Society for Ameri-
can City and Regional Planning History asked a large sample 
of urban historians, social scientists, planning faculty, and 
working planners and architects to nominate the most impor-
tant influences on the American metropolis over the past 50 
years (Table 12.1). The list reflects the overwhelming impact 
of the federal government on the American metropolis, espe-
cially through policies that have promoted suburbanization 
and sprawl, sometimes intentionally and sometimes unin-
tentionally. The two items at the top of the list have been of 
overwhelming importance in shaping the sprawling, polycen-
tric metropolitan areas that are characteristic of contemporary 
North American urbanization. The 1956 Interstate Highway 
Act created a 41,000-mile Interstate Highway System that

transformed the American metropolis in ways its planners 
never anticipated. The system was supposed to support down-
town districts by rescuing them from traffic congestion while 
facilitating high-speed long-distance travel from city to city. 
But their construction devastated many urban neighborhoods 
and the new peripheral beltways, originally intended to enable 
long-distance travelers to bypass crowded city centers, became 
shortcuts to sprawl.
Second on the list is the Federal Housing Administration's 
mortgage financing and regulation of subdivisions. The Federal 
Housing Administration (FHA) was created in the 1930s in the 
midst of the Depression and one of its key tasks was to stimu-
late the labor-intensive construction industry by underwrit-
ing fixed-rate mortgages with low down payments. In order to 
prevent the kind of shoddy construction that had been all too 
common in the early growth of American cities, the FHA also 
established and enforced minimum standards for the housing 
financed by its guaranteed loans. But the FHA refused to in-
sure mortgages on older houses in older urban neighborhoods 
and its 1939 Underwriting Manual openly recommended that 
subdivision developers use restrictive covenants to prevent the 
sale of homes to minorities. It was not until 1949 that discrimi-
natory covenants were declared unconstitutional. By then the 
FHA had firmly established the framework for future  urban 
growth: one with a pronounced bias toward detached single-
family owner-occupied housing in the suburbs, for white 
households.
The Multi-Nodal City
The suburban sprawl that is so characteristic of North Ameri-
can metropolitan areas is typically arranged around one or 
more "central cities". Central cities are the original, core  
jurisdictions of metropolitan areas. They are organized around 
a traditional downtown, known as the central business district, 
or CBD: the nucleus of commercial land uses. It traditionally 
contains the densest concentration of shops, offices, and ware-
houses and the tallest nonresidential buildings (Figure 12.1).  

It originally developed at the nodal point of transportation 
routes so that it also contains bus stations, railway terminals, 
and hotels. The CBD usually is surrounded by a zone of mixed 
land uses: warehouses, small factories and workshops, special-
ized stores, apartment buildings, public housing projects, and 
older residential neighborhoods. This zone is often referred 
to as the zone in transition because of its mixture of growth, 
change, and decline. Beyond this zone are residential neigh-
borhoods, often highly segregated in terms of race and ethnic-
ity (see Box 12.1: "Visualizing Geography: Racial Segregation"). 
The advent of trucks and automobiles allowed both industry 
and households to become mobile, and the Interstate Highway 
Act and FHA policies allowed both industry and households to 
decentralize. New, automobile-based suburban nodes of com-
mercial and industrial activity began to emerge. They were not 
arranged in any predictable fashion except in relation to sur-
rounding land uses. They might develop around a government 
center, a university, a transit stop, or a highway intersection. If 
the nodes were office and retailing centers, they tended to at-
tract middle-income residential development, whereas if they 
were industrial centers, they would attract working-class resi-
dential development. In this way, American cities began to de-
velop an irregular-shaped patchwork of land uses and sprawl 
around multiple nodal centers.
Accessibility versus Living Space It is in many ways 
counterintuitive that affluent suburbanites have to travel long 
distances to work in nodal centers from distant suburbs while 
disadvantaged households live close by the jobs and urban 
amenities that cluster in nodal centers. According to Ameri-
can Community Survey data, over 220 million adults average 
an hour and a half a day in their cars. Economists would ex-
pect people to seek to maximize the utility they derive from 
a particular location. The utility of a specific place or loca-
tion refers to its usefulness to a particular person or group. 
◀ Figure 12.1 The central city 
This photograph of Chicago shows 
the concentration of high-rise office 
buildings on the skyline that is typical 
of central business districts (CBDs) in 
North American metropolitan areas.
The price people are prepared to pay for different locations—
what economists call the bid-rent—is a direct reflection of 
this utility. In general, the utility of a location is a function of 
its  accessibility. Commercial land users want to be accessible 
to one another, to markets, and to workers; private residents 
want to be accessible to jobs, amenities, and friends; and pub-
lic institutions want to be accessible to clients. In an ideal-
ized, theoretical city built on an isotropic surface, the point of 
maximum accessibility is the city center. An isotropic surface 
is a hypothetical, uniform plane: flat, and with no variations 
in its physical attributes. Under these conditions, accessibil-
ity decreases steadily with distance from a nodal center. Like-
wise, utility decreases, but at different rates for different land 
users. This idealized pattern of decreasing accessibility and 
utility is reflected in concentric zones of different mixes of 
land use (Figure 12.2).
▲ Figure 12.2 Accessibility, bid-rent, and urban structure Competition 
for accessible sites near the city center is an important determinant of land-
use patterns. Different users are prepared to pay different amounts—the 
bid-rents—for locations at various distances from the city center. The result is 
often a concentric pattern of land uses.

The racial and ethnic composition of the United States has 
steadily become more diverse - a result of immigration and 
differential birth rates. Studies of racial segregation within U.S.
metropolitan areas have found that, overall, the degree of segre-
gation peaked between 1960 and 1970. Between 1980 and 2010 
racial segregation declined, but at a very slow pace. In 2010 the 
average white person in metropolitan America lived in a neigh
ed in a neigh-
borhood that was 75 percent white, while the average African
American lived in a neighborhood that was only 35 percent white 
and as much as 45 percent black. Hispanics and Asians are
considerably less segregated than African Americans, and their
segregation levels have remained steady for several decades. In
addition, since both these groups are growing, there is a
tendency for their neighborhoods to become more homoge-
neous. As a result, these groups live in more isolated settings
now than they did in the 1980s.

In Midwestern cities, the racial divide tends to be quite sharp.
In Chicago, bands of different racial groups, blacks, and
Latinos radiate out from the city center, echoing the models
of urban social geography developed in the 1930s.
 In Atlanta, there is a simple north-south division, with whites
(and a few enclaves of Asians) in the northern half of the 
metro area, and African Americans in the southern half.
1. Why do you think racial groups are more mixed in some cities,
compared to others? Compare historical factors (civil rights movement, 
WWII, American Indian relocation) and immigration polices with what 
you have learned.
2. Analyze the demographic concept of "minority-majority" geographies 
by doing an Internet search on "minority-majority cities/counties/states."
Where are these cities/counties/states located and what do you observe 
about the political aﬃliations, immigration policies, social programs and
economy compared to white majority areas?

The implication of this model is that the poorest house-
holds will end up occupying the periphery of the city.  Although 
this is true in some parts of the world, we know that in North 
America it is not the case. In fact, the farthest suburbs are gen-
erally the territory of wealthier households, while the poor 
usually occupy more accessible locations nearer city centers. 
To reflect reality, some of the assumptions of the economist's 
model must be modified. In this case, we must assume that 
wealthier households trade off the convenience of accessibility 
for the greater utility of being able to consume larger amounts 
of (relatively cheap) suburban space. Poorer households, 
 unable to afford the recurrent costs of transportation, trade off 
living space for accessibility to jobs and end up in high-den-
sity areas, at expensive locations, near their jobs.  Because of 
the presumed trade-off between accessibility and living space, 
this modified urban land-use model is often  referred to as a 
 trade-off model.
APPLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE
1. Identify three different trade-offs that you have made in terms 
of your own living space. List three ways these trade-offs have 
affected your access to school, transportation, and job.
2. Think about how these trade-offs have impacted your access to 
school, transportation and job; and share what motivated you to 
select one trade-off over another.
The Polycentric Metropolis
With continued urban growth, the irregular-shaped, multiple-
nuclei patchwork of land uses of the mid-twentieth century 
city has scaled up into polycentric metropolitan regions. Dur-
ing the middle decades of the twentieth century, American 
cities were reshaped by automobiles. The spurt of suburbaniza-
tion resulting from the combination of increased automobility, 
massive federal outlays on highway construction, and federal 
mortgage insurance programs that underpinned the growth 
of home ownership produced a polycentric spatial structure. 
Suburban nodes of office and retail employment each had their 
own urban realms, semiautonomous subregions that displaced 
the simple core-periphery relationship between city centers 
and their suburbs. Initially, the shift to an expanded poly-
centric metropolis was most pronounced in the northeastern 
United States. Geographer Jean Gottmann captured the mo-
ment in 1961 with his conceptualization of "megalopolis"—
his term for the highly urbanized region between Boston and 
Washington, D.C.
In the polycentric new metropolis (Figure 12.3), the system 
of nodes and realms is bound together with ever-expanding 
four-, six-, and eight-lane highways. It is interspersed with 
smaller clusters of decentralized employment, studded with 
micropolitan centers and filled out with booming stand-alone 
suburbs. Traditional nodal anchors—downtown commercial 
centers—remain very important, especially as settings for the 
advanced business services—advertising, banking, insurance, 
investment management, and logistics services. But in addition 
there are other nodes. These vary in character and include:
■ edge cities, decentralized clusters of retailing and office 
development, often located on an axis with a major air-
port, sometimes adjacent to a high-speed rail station, and 
always linked to an urban freeway system;
■ newer business centers, often developing in a prestigious 
residential quarter and serving as a setting for newer ser-
vices such as corporate headquarters, the media, advertis-
ing, public relations, and design;
■ outermost complexes of back-office and R&D operations, 
typically near major transport hubs 20 to 30 miles from the 
main core; and
■ specialized subcenters, usually for education, entertain-
ment, and sporting complexes and exhibition and conven-
tion centers.1
Some urbanized regions have been extended and reshaped 
into polycentric networks of half a dozen or more urban realms 
and as many as 50 nodal centers of different types and sizes 
(Figure 12.4). These centers are physically separate but func-
tionally networked and they draw enormous economic strength

from a new functional division of labor. Bound together 
through urban freeways, arterial highways, beltways, and inter-
states, new metropolises coalesce into "megapolitan" regions 
that dominate national economies. The term metroburbia  
has emerged to capture the way that residential settings in 
suburban and ex-urban areas are thoroughly interspersed with 
office employment and high-end retailing.
Meanwhile, some older inner-urban districts have been 
redeveloped around mixed-use projects—complexes of 
shops, offices, and apartments. Some older, centrally  located, 
 working-class neighborhoods have also been invaded by higher-
income households seeking the character and convenience of 
centrally located and (for them) less expensive residences—a 
process known as gentrification (Figure 12.5). Gentrification 
involves the renovation of housing in older, centrally located 
lower-income neighborhoods through an influx of more afflu-
ent households seeking the character and convenience of less-
expensive but well-located residences. Typically, the colonizing 
households are dominated by young professionals involved in 
the "new economy," together with teachers, lawyers, designers, 
artists, architects, writers, and creative staff in advertising firms. 
The increased pool of professional, administrative, managerial, 
and technical workers in the new economy has generated an 
expanding group of potential gentrifiers. They are attracted to 
(mildly) edgy districts with some history, human scale, and 
ethnic and architectural diversity, and they often use "sweat 
equity"—their own,  do-it-yourself labor—for renovations and 
improvements to older properties. Their arrival in inner-city 
districts tends to displace poorer households as the new fash-
ionability and buzz of the district pushes 
up rents and house prices, increases 
property taxes, and prompts the closure 
of stores specializing in inexpensive 
goods and produce. Incoming gentrifiers, 
meanwhile, contribute to the physical 
renovation or rehabilitation of the older 
and usually rather deteriorated housing 
stock while supporting new businesses 
such as upscale restaurants, coffee shops, 
delicatessens, wine bars, galleries, cloth-
ing boutiques, and bookstores.
Because it brings about improve-
ments to the built environment, en-
courages new retail activity, and results 
in the expansion of the local tax base 
without necessarily drawing heavily on 
public funds, gentrification can be seen 
as a good thing, and has been widely 
encouraged by city governments. It has 
also been eagerly exploited by realtors 
and landlords seeking to turn a profit

areas merging into disjointed and decentralized urban landscapes with varying-sized urban centers, subcenters, and satellites 
and unexpected juxtapositions of form and function. The residential settings in suburban and ex-urban areas are thoroughly 
interspersed with office employment and high-end retailing, creating "metroburban" landscapes.

on older properties. But because it drives up house prices and 
results in the displacement of vulnerable and disadvantaged 
households, it is not always so straightforward an issue.
APPLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE
1. Create a map like the ones in Figures 12.3 and 12.4 for your 
metropolitan area and label urban realms, major highways, edge 
cities, secondary business centers, and neighborhoods.
2. Analyze which areas have experienced gentrification by 
comparing neighborhood renovations, property value, income 
averages, age and ethnicity of inhabitants, and use media sources 
to observe how the culture of the community may have changed. 
Problems of North American Cities
For all their relative prosperity, North American cities have 
their share of problems. Suburban sprawl is generally regarded 
as a distinctively North American problem, though it has its 
apologists. The most acute problems, though, are localized in 
central city areas and are interrelated: fiscal problems, infra-
structure problems, and localized cycles of poverty and spirals 
of neighborhood decay.
Sprawl The unplanned, ad hoc nature of most  suburban 
development destroys millions of acres of wildlife habitat 
and agricultural land every year. Rationalized,  standardized, 
and tightly zoned off-ramp subdivisions are placeless 
 neighborhoods that lack visual, demographic, and social 
 diversity (Figure 12.6). The politics and economics of private 
 subdivision—the "sprawl machine"—lead to a lack of public  
open space,  urban infrastructure, and civic amenities. In-
creased traffic, punishing commutes, and a chronic de-
pendence on  automobiles are all the result of low-density, 
single-family suburban  developments. The environmental 
costs of automobile dependency include air pollution—and 
in  particular the generation of millions of tons of greenhouse 
gases from suburban commuters. Run-off from the roads and 
parking lots pollutes suburban watersheds. The automobile-
dependent lifestyles associated with sprawl, meanwhile, lead 
to increases in rates of asthma, lung cancer, and heart prob-
lems. Stress resulting from commuting has adverse effects on 
marriages and family life.
The counterargument is that sprawl is a logical consequence 
of economic growth and the democratization of society, provid-
ing millions of people with the kinds of mobility, privacy, and 
choice that were once the prerogatives of the rich and power-
ful. Sprawl reflects market forces and represents the desires and 
preferences of the broad mass of people for living space. Joel Kot-
kin, a blogger and popular speaker on the business circuit, has 
persistently argued that most people seem to like living in the 
suburbs: so why all the fuss? Libertarian think tanks like the Rea-
son Foundation and the Heritage Foundation have made efforts 
to counter antisprawl arguments on the ideological principle of 
freedom of markets and individual choice. What they overlook, 
from a geographical perspective, is that the benefits of sprawl—
for example, more housing for less cost with higher eventual ap-
preciation—still tend to accrue to Americans individually, while 
sprawl's cost in infrastructure building, energy generation, and 
pollution mitigation tends to be borne by society overall.
Fiscal Problems The term fiscal refers to government rev-
enue or taxes. Economic restructuring and metropolitan sprawl 
have left central cities with a chronic "fiscal squeeze." A fiscal 
squeeze occurs when increasing limitations on tax revenues 
combine with increasing demands for expenditures on urban in-
frastructure and city services. The revenue-generating potential 
of most central cities has steadily fallen as metropolitan areas 
have lost both residential and commercial taxpayers to subur-
ban jurisdictions. Growth industries, white-collar jobs, retailing, 
and more affluent households have moved out to suburban and 
ex-urban jurisdictions, taking their local tax dollars with them.
At the same time, growth in property-tax revenues from 
older, decaying neighborhoods has slowed as the growth of 
property values has slowed. At the same 
time, these older, decaying neighbor-
hoods cost more to maintain and ser-
vice. The residual populations of these 
neighborhoods, with high proportions of 
elderly and indigent households, are in-
creasingly in need of municipal welfare 
services. Large numbers of low-income 
migrants and immigrants also bring in-
creased demands for municipal services. 
Added to all this, central city govern-
ments are still responsible for services 
and amenities used by the entire metro-
politan population: municipal galleries 
and museums, sports facilities, parks, 
traffic police, and public transport, for 
example. The net result is that many cen-
tral city jurisdictions are in a precarious 
financial position. Stockton, California,

filed for bankruptcy in 2012, followed by Detroit in 2013. In 
a constant drive to develop revenue-generating projects, cities 
compete fiercely with one another to finance and attract tourist 
developments, museums, sports franchises, and business and 
conference centers.
Infrastructure Problems As fiscal problems have inten-
sified, public spending on the urban infrastructure of roads, 
bridges, parking spaces, transit systems, communications sys-
tems, power lines, gas lines, street lighting, water mains, sew-
ers, and drains has declined. Meanwhile, much of the original 
infrastructure, put in place 75 or 100 years ago with a design 
life of 50 or 75 years, is obsolete, worn out, and in some cases 
perilously near the point of collapse. Major disasters, such 
as the failure of New Orleans' levee system during Hurricane 
 Katrina in 2005, the collapse of the I-35W bridge in Minneapo-
lis in 2007, and the collapse of the Interstate 5 bridge over the 
Skagit River at Mount Vernon, Washington State in 2013, have 
highlighted the problem.
Infrastructure problems are easily overlooked because 
they build up slowly. Only when a bridge collapses or a wa-
ter main bursts are infrastructure problems newsworthy. In 
Boston, three-quarters of the sewer system was built a cen-
tury or more ago and has now deteriorated to the point where 
about 20 percent of the system's overall flow is lost to leaks. 
In Cleveland, the District of Columbia, and Philadelphia, the 
losses approach 25 percent. Hundreds of kilometers of water 
mains in New York City have been identified as being in need 
of replacement, at an estimated cost of over $5 billion. Overall,  
only 50 percent of all wastewater treatment systems in Amer-
ica are operating at 80 percent or more of capacity; one in nine 
of the nation's 607,380 bridges are rated as structurally defi-
cient; 42 percent of major urban highways remain congested; 
and there are  almost a quarter of a million water main breaks 
annually  (Figure 12.7). The American Society of Civil Engineers 
2013 Report Card on America's Infrastructure estimated that 
$3.6 trillion of  investment is needed by 2020—about twice the 
current rate. 2
Freshwater supplies are also at risk: Old water systems are 
unable to cope with the leaching of pollutants into city water. 
Common pollutants include chlorides, oil, phosphates, and 
nondegradable toxic chemicals from industrial wastewater; 
dissolved salts and chemicals from highway de-icing; nitrates 
and ammonia from fertilizers and sewage; and coliform bacte-
ria from septic tanks and sewage. Many cities still use water-
cleaning technology dating to World War I. About one-third 
of all towns and cities in the United States have contaminated 
water supplies, and about eight million people use water that 
is potentially dangerous.
Poverty and Neighborhood Decay Inner-city  poverty  
and neighborhood decay have become increasingly pronounced 
in the past several decades as manufacturing, warehousing, 
and retailing jobs have moved out to suburban and edge-city 
locations and as many of the more prosperous households have 
moved out to be near these jobs. The spiral of neighborhood 
decay typically begins with substandard housing occupied by 
low-income households that can afford to rent only a mini-
mal amount of space. The consequent overcrowding not only 
causes greater wear and tear on the housing itself but also puts 
pressure on the neighborhood infrastructure of streets, parks, 
schools, and playgrounds. The need for maintenance and re-
pair increases quickly and is rarely met.  Individual households 
cannot afford it, and landlords have no incentive, because they 
have a captive market. Public authorities face a fiscal squeeze 
and are in any case often indifferent to the needs of such neigh-
borhoods because of their relative lack of political power.
Shops and privately run services such as restaurants and 
hair salons are afflicted with the same syndrome of decay. 
With a low-income clientele, profit margins must be kept low, 
leaving little to spare for upkeep or improvement. Many small 
businesses fail, or relocate to more favorable settings, leav-
ing commercial property vacant for long periods. In extreme 
cases, property is abandoned when the owners are unable to 
find renters or buyers. Residential buildings may also be left 
derelict.
Meanwhile, a dismal cycle of poverty intersects with these 
localized spirals of decay. The cycle of poverty involves the 
transmission of poverty and deprivation from one generation 
to another through a combination of domestic circumstances 
and local conditions. This cycle begins with an absence of em-
ployment opportunities and, therefore, a concentration of low 
incomes, poor housing, and overcrowded conditions. Such 
conditions are unhealthy. Overcrowding makes people vul-
nerable to poor health, which is compounded by poor diets. 
This contributes to absenteeism from work, which results in 
decreased income. Similarly, absenteeism from school because 
of illness contributes to the cycle of poverty by constraining 
educational achievement, limiting occupational skills, and 
leading to low wages. Crowding also produces psychological

12.2   Geography Matters
In many big cities, a premiere tourist experience is to take the elevator to the 
top of an iconic tall building. By getting above the city, over the dense array 
of structures that block your eye, you can get a sense of the city's shape and 
form, its neighbourhoods and street systems, its morphology and feel: New 
York with its grids, Chicago and the lake, London and Paris with their mixture 
of old and new. 
Detroit offers a similar opportunity. The tallest building in Detroit is the 
73-story Renaissance Center, which rises along Detroit's riverfront. When 
you take the glass elevator up, you see a very distinctive urban landscape. 
Fields of low-rise housing heading out towards an endless horizon, wide 
functional boulevards crossing from east to west, and the Detroit river with 
its regular flow of tankers, railway lines and highways connecting cross-town 
neighbourhoods and factories now long abandoned. This is a city that was 
created to build cars. While Detroit had a wide array of manufacturing in-
dustries in the 1940s and 50s, fully 40% of them served the production of 
automobiles. Such an economy gave rise to two distinctive urban dynamics. 
First, the city is organised almost like a series of linked factory towns, with 
small plants serving as the organising principal for the neighbourhoods and 
transport links that surround it. Unlike the more flexible industries of today, 
the factories that defined Detroit made single products with little variation 
and relied upon a steady stream of raw materials It is not uncommon to see 
railway lines and major thoroughfares running straight through the city. Sec-
ond, these factories paid its workers relatively well. Given the lack of geo-
graphical impediments, single plot housing was the norm. So even though 
Detroit at its height had a population of over 1.8 million, there was none of 
the density found in cities like Chicago and New York. As the attached map 
shows, Detroit's urban footprint can accommodate Manhattan, Boston, and 
San Francisco combined (Figure 12.A). Even at its height, Detroit's urban 
density was around 13,000 people per square mile. The current density of 
Manhattan per square mile is around 70,000 people. 
Te Empty City
Detroit's unique geography has given rise to some of its biggest prob-
lems. While many cities have experienced economic and population 
decline over the last forty years, Detroit's particular form of urban devel-
opment has meant that population loss has resulted in large areas of the 
city becoming abandoned and depopulated. Today almost forty square 
miles in Detroit are vacant, almost a third of the city's total land. Many 
of these empty lots are abandoned homes, but 
a number are former factories, warehouses and 
other commercial structures, some of which 
have been demolished and other still stand, 
slowly decaying. The checkerboard nature of 
vacancy means that neighbourhoods that are 
relatively well-populated feel empty, since they 
are often surrounded by, and interspersed with, 
abandoned homes and vacant land. This has 
created a number of dilemmas for the city. It is 
difficult to provide services, such as fire, police 
and rubbish collection to the small pockets of 
populations spread throughout the city's wide 
area; it is difficult to attract developers since 
land parcels are small and scattered and large 
lots difficult to assemble; it is difficult to attract 
shops and grocery stores since there are few 
sites where they can be assured of capturing 
a local market; and it is difficult to raise funds 
because tax revenues are low, land taxes are 
not being paid, and eminent domain laws are 
weak. Detroit's geography was well-suited to 
a particular economic project, but the imprint 
it left upon the landscape has been far more 
durable than the economy that created it. And 
while many of Detroit's problems are similar to 
those in other cities, the geographic dimension 
creates a number of unique challenges. 
Detroit's Open Geography: Problems and Potential 
By Mitch Rose, University of Aberystwyth

CHAPTER 12   City Spaces:  Urban Structure    465
City Farms
Land is usually a precious commodity, especially in cities. Why is land the 
problem in Detroit? This is one of the paradoxes of capitalism: if something 
is not deemed to have market value it is not deemed to be valuable. It is not 
surprising, therefore, that the focus of Detroit's economic strategy has been 
to increase the value of its land. However, in the midst of these market driven 
strategies, a number of community lead initiatives are re-claiming the value of 
land by putting it to use in innovative ways. These include furniture making 
from local 'weed-woods' like ailanthus altissima (Tree-of-heaven), neighbour-
hood-scale art projects like the Heidelberg Project, and outdoor training labs 
that promote biologically appropriate landscape development. However, 
the initiative that has become most widespread in the city is urban farming.  
Currently there are over 2,000 small to medium scale farms in Detroit, 
most of which are on vacant and abandoned land, run by local church 
groups, community organisations and state schools (Figure 12.B). 
Farming in Detroit was begun primarily by local residents to accomplish 
two things: (1) make the empty lots between their homes productive and 
attractive, and (2) have access to fresh produce, as fruits and vegetables are 
scarce in a city with few grocery stores. 
Building a New Economy
Given the popularity of urban farming in the city, one could argue that 
Detroit is not only developing a different valuation of land, it is devel-
oping an alternative mode of economic development. For example, 
Detroit's Eastern Market, an open-air wholesale and retail market, has 
been instrumental in providing local farmers an outlet for their produce  
(Figure 12.C). The market also encourages the proliferation of farms 
throughout the city. By providing food production services (such as freezing 
and jam making) and technical assistance (like soil sampling and equipment 
training), it hopes to have 20% of Detroit's food produced locally by 2020. 
The rationale for this push is to create a more robust approach to food 
security. Given Detroit's past, many in the city believe that its population's 
basic needs cannot be provided by the market or the state. Thus, Eastern 
Market is attempting to foster an economy whose primary aim is not to gen-
erate profits or improve the city's GDP, but to secure the city's basic needs. 
What is interesting about Eastern Market is not simply its ambition to create 
food security but its recognition that the economy is not 'one thing' - it 
is not simply a set of wage-labour relations designed to produce surplus 
capital. The idea than an economy can be built to produce food security 
opens our imagination to other outputs that an economy could potentially 
produce: security, biodiversity, public health, and community cohesion. De-
troit's geography has created some unique challenges, it has also produced 
some innovative responses - and perhaps some thought-provoking ques-
tions about 'what an economy is' and 'what an economy can do'.  
 
1.  What other one-industry cities in the U.S. are struggling to sur-
vive? Are these cities unique in terms of land mass?
 
2.  What other kinds of economies can you imagine in a city  
reinventing itself as Detroit is doing?

stress, which contributes to social disorganization and a vari-
ety of pathological behaviors, including crime and vandalism. 
Such conditions not only affect people's educational achieve-
ment and employment opportunities but also lead to label-
ing of the neighborhood, whereby all residents may find their 
employment opportunities affected by the poor image of their 
community.
One of the most important elements in the cycle of neigh-
borhood poverty is the educational setting. Schools, obso-
lete and physically deteriorated like their surroundings, are 
unattractive to teachers—partly because of the physical en-
vironment and partly because of the social and disciplinary en-
vironment. Fiscal squeeze leaves schools resource-poor, with 
relatively small budgets for staff, equipment, and materials. 
Over the long term, poor educational resources translate into 
poor education, however positive the values of students and 
their parents. Poor education limits occupational choice and, 
ultimately, results in lower incomes. Students, faced with evi-
dence all around them of unemployment or low-wage jobs at 
the end of school careers, find it difficult to be positive about 
school. The result becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy of failure, 
and people become trapped in areas of concentrated poverty 
(Figure 12.8).
Many areas of concentrated poverty are also racial ghet-
tos, although not all ghettos are poverty areas. Recall that 
ethnic and racial congregation can mitigate the effects of 
poverty. Nevertheless, discrimination is usually the main 
cause of ghettoization. In the United States, discrimination in 
housing markets is illegal, but it nevertheless takes place in a 
variety of ways. One example of housing-market discrimina-
tion by banks and other lending institutions is the practice of 
redlining. Redlining involves marking off bad-risk neighbor-
hoods on a city map and then using the map to determine 
lending policy. This practice results in a bias against minori-
ties,  female-headed households, and other vulnerable groups 
who tend to be localized in low-income neighborhoods. 
Redlining tends to become another self-fulfilling prophecy, 
since neighborhoods starved of property loans become pro-
gressively more run-down and therefore increasingly unat-
tractive to lenders. Discrimination affects education and labor 
markets as well as housing markets. In the case of ghetto pov-
erty, all three types of discrimination come together, reinforc-
ing the cycle of poverty and intensifying the disadvantages of 
the minority poor.
APPLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE
1. Identify two fiscal, industrial, and/or neighborhood problems in 
your city.
2. Select any city in your country which has experienced problems 
of urban sprawl. Look at how the urban sprawl has affected the 
urban peripheries in the case of people already living there. List 
one fiscal, industrial, and neighborhood problem specific to urban 
peripheries. 
Urban Design and Planning
Urban planning in North America is relatively weak,  reflecting 
the importance of property rights in local and national  politics, 
the unpopularity of government intervention of any kind, and 
the fragmentation of planning responsibilities among  multiple 
urban and suburban jurisdictions in most  metropolitan  regions. 
Much of suburbia is, in practice, planned by  developers and 
governed by private homeowner associations with their 
own sets of rules. In central cities, planning has morphed 
into  public-private cooperation, with local governments 
 increasingly behaving like businesses in their attempts to 
 attract  economic development and balance the books.
New Urbanism All this is not to say that there 
are no attempts at planning better cities. In par-
ticular, the problems of sprawl have given rise to 
a distinctively North American planning move-
ment, the so-called New Urbanism. It is based 
on the observation that walkable, diverse, urban 
places like Nantucket, Massachusetts, Alexandria, 
Virginia, Georgetown, Washington, D.C., historic 
Charleston, South Carolina, and Savannah, Geor-
gia, are enduringly popular. New urban spaces, 
it is argued, should be designed to be like these 
by specifying design codes that replicate the best 
features of such places, with special emphasis on 
traditional vocabulary boulevards, plazas, monu-
ments, and the pedestrian scale of streets and 
public spaces. Well-designed front porches, nar-
row streets, and smaller lot sizes will actively pro-
duce community by bringing neighbors together 
more closely and more frequently; and therefore 
be inclined to greet and chat with each other more 
▼ Figure 12.8 Poverty areas Concentrations of poverty are found not 
only in decaying inner-city areas but also in newer public housing projects 
and in older suburbs that have filtered down the housing scale, as in this 
 example in Washington, DC. 

CHAPTER 12   City Spaces:  Urban Structure    467
often, leading to a feelings of community, civility, and sense 
of place. The whole approach is based on a great deal of accu-
mulated wisdom about urban planning but has been given an 
updated angle because of its emphasis on  design codes. These 
have been specified in  detail in a  SmartCode  approved by a 
nonprofit organization, the  Congress for the New Urbanism.
New Urbanism has certainly enlivened interest in planning 
and urban design, and brought fresh ideas to what had become 
routinized and bureaucratized issues of land use and zoning. 
It has also reinforced sense of place, livability, sustainability, 
and quality of life as important policy issues, and helped to 
resurrect the idea of a definable public interest. New Urbanism 
appeals to developers because its closely written codes allevi-
ate many of the problems of customer choice associated with 
new suburban development and because it has a strong brand 
identity with sensibilities—a vision of community and a sense 
of certainty, respectability, and predictability—that appeal to 
the key market segment of upper-middle-class households. 
Nevertheless, New Urbanism has come in for a great deal of 
criticism as being backward-looking and superficial, with no 
real engagement with the physical infrastructure and politi-
cal economy of the city as a whole. The principal underlying 
weakness of New Urbanism, though, is that it falls into the trap 
of environmental determinism, privileging spatial form over 
social process: design codes become behavior codes, ignoring 
the messy complexity and creativity of real urban life, its poli-
tics, stresses, and contradictions.
EUROPEAN CITIES
European cities, like North American cities, reflect the opera-
tion of competitive land markets and social congregation along 
ethnic lines. They also suffer from similar problems of urban 
management, infrastructure maintenance, and poverty. What 
makes most European cities distinctive in comparison with 
North American cities is that they are the product of several 
major epochs of urban development.
Features of European Cities
As we saw in Chapter 2, many of today's most important Eu-
ropean cities were founded in the Roman period, and it is not 
uncommon for the outlines of Roman and medieval urban de-
velopment to be preserved in their street plans. Many distinc-
tive features of European cities derive from their long history. 
In the historic cores of some older cities, the layout of streets 
reflects ancient patterns of rural settlement and field boundar-
ies. Beyond these historic cores, narrow, complex streets are 
the product of the long, slow growth of European cities in the 
pre-automobile era, when hand-pushed and horse-drawn carts 
were the principal means of transportation and urban develop-
ment was piecemeal and small-scale.
Plazas and squares are another important historical legacy 
in many European cities. Greek, Roman, and medieval cities 
were all characterized by plazas, central squares, and market-
places, and those elements are still important nodes of urban 
activity (Figure 12.9). European history also means that its cit-
ies bear the accessories and scars of war. The legacy of defen-
sive hilltop and cliff-top sites and city walls has limited and 
shaped the growth of modern European cities, while in more 
recent times the bombings and shellings of World War II de-
stroyed many city buildings (Figure 12.10).
The legacy of a long and varied history includes a rich va-
riety of symbolism. Europeans are reminded of their past not 
only by large numbers of statues and memorials but also by 
cathedrals, churches, and monasteries; by guildhalls and city 
walls; by the palaces of royalty and the mansions of aristocracy; 
and by city halls and the libraries, museums, sports stadiums,

mante for Ludovico Maria Sforza

to the Castello Sforzesco. Unified 
by the arcades that completely 
surround the square, the piazza 
provides an important social 
space for the citizens of the town.

and galleries that are monuments to civic achievement. Euro-
pean cities are also typically compact in form, resulting in high 
densities of population. A long history of pre-automobile ur-
ban development and the constraints of peripheral defensive 
walls all made urban land expensive and encouraged a tradi-
tion of high-density living in tenements and apartment houses.
Other distinctive features of European cities include:
■ Low skylines—Although the larger European cities have a 
fair number of high-rise apartment buildings and a sprinkling 
of office skyscrapers, they all offer a predominantly low sky-
line. This is partly because much of their growth came before 
the invention of the elevator and the development of steel-
reinforced, concrete building techniques and partly because 
of master plans and building codes (some written as long ago 
as the sixteenth century) seeking to preserve the dominance 
of monumental buildings like palaces and cathedrals.
■ Lively downtowns—The CBDs of European cities have 
retained their focal position in residents' shopping and 
social lives because of the relatively late arrival of the sub-
urbanizing influence of the automobile and strong plan-
ning controls directed against urban sprawl.
■ Neighborhood stability—Europeans change residence, on 
average, about half as often as Americans. In addition, the 
physical life cycle of city neighborhoods tends to be longer 
because of the past use of durable construction materials, 
such as brick and stone. As a result, European cities pro-
vide relatively stable socioeconomic environments.
■ Municipal socialism—For decades, European welfare 
states have provided a broad range of municipal services 
and  amenities, from clinics to public transit systems. 
Perhaps the most important to urban structure is social 
housing (public housing), which accounts for 20 to 40 
percent of all housing in most larger English, French, and 
German cities. In recent years, neoliberal policies have re-
sulted in a reduction in public services, especially in France 
and Great Britain.
The richness of European history and the diversity of 
 Europe's geography mean that there are important regional 
variations: The industrial cities of northern England, north-
eastern France, and the Ruhr district of Germany, for example, 
are quite different in character from the cities of Mediterra-
nean Europe. One of the most interesting regional variations 
is in Eastern Europe, where the legacy of an interlude of 44 
years of socialism (1945-1989) was grafted onto cities that 
had already developed mature patterns of land use and social 
differentiation. Major examples include Belgrade, Budapest, 
 Katowice, Kraków, Leipzig, Prague, and Warsaw. State control 
of land and housing meant that huge public housing estates 
and industrial zones were created in outlying districts. The 
structure of the older cities was little altered, however, apart 
from the addition of socialist monuments and the renaming of 
streets.
European Urban Design  
and Planning
European city planning and design have a long history. 
Most Greek and Roman settlements were laid out on grid 
systems, within which the siting of key buildings and the 
relationship of neighborhoods to one another were carefully 
considered.
The roots of modern Western urban planning and design 
can be traced to the Renaissance and Baroque periods (between 
the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries) in Europe. Artists and 
intellectuals dreamed of ideal cities, and rich and powerful 
regimes used urban design to produce extravagant symboliza-
tions of wealth, power, and destiny. Inspired by the classical 
art forms of ancient Greece and Rome, Renaissance urban de-
sign sought to recast cities to show off the power and the glory 
of the state and the Church. Spreading slowly from its origins 
in Italy at the beginning of the fifteenth century, Renaissance 
design had diffused to most of the larger cities of  Europe by the 
end of the eighteenth century. Dramatic advances in military 
ordnance (cannon and artillery) brought a surge of planned 
redevelopment that featured impressive fortifications; geomet-
ric-shaped redoubts, or strongholds; and an extensive glacis 
militaire—a sloping, clear zone of fire. Inside new walls, cit-
ies were recast according to a new aesthetic of grand design  
(Figure 12.11)—fancy palaces and geometrical plans, 
streetscapes, and gardens that emphasized views of dramatic 
perspectives. These developments were often of such a scale 
that they effectively fixed the layout of cities well into the eigh-
teenth and even into the nineteenth century, when walls and/
or glacis eventually made way for urban redevelopment in the 
form of parks, railway lines, or beltways.
Order, Safety, and Efficiency As societies and economies 
became more complex with the transition to industrial capital-

symbolize the new seats of power and authority. An important 
early precedent was set in Paris by Napoleon III, who presided 
over a comprehensive program of urban redevelopment and 
monumental urban design. The work was carried out by Baron 
Georges Haussmann between 1853 and 1870. Haussmann de-
molished large sections of old Paris to make way for broad, 
new, tree-lined avenues (Figure 12.12) and numerous public 
open spaces and monuments. In doing so, he made the city not 
only more efficient (wide boulevards meant better flows of traf-
fic) and a better place to live (parks and gardens allowed more 
fresh air and sunlight into a crowded city and were held to be 
a "civilizing" influence) but also safer from revolutionary poli-
tics (wide boulevards were hard to barricade; monuments and 
statues instilled a sense of pride and civic identity).
The preferred architectural style for these new designs 
was the Beaux Arts style, which takes its name from L'École 
des Beaux Arts in Paris. In this school, architects were trained 
to draw on Classical, Renaissance, and Baroque styles to syn-
thesize new designs for the Industrial Age. The idea was that 
the new buildings would blend artfully with the older palaces, 
cathedrals, and civic buildings that dominated European city 
centers. Haussmann's ideas were widely influential and exten-
sively copied.
Modern Urban Design Early in the twentieth century 
there emerged a different intellectual and artistic reaction to the 
pressures of industrialization and urbanization. The  Modern 
movement was based on the idea that buildings and cities 
should be designed and run like machines. Equally important 
to the Modernists was the idea that urban design should not 
simply reflect dominant social and cultural values, but, rather, 
help create a new moral and social order. The movement's

best-known advocate was Le Corbusier, a Paris-based Swiss 
who provided the inspiration for technocratic urban design. 
Modernist buildings sought to dramatize technology, exploit 
industrial production techniques, and use modern materials 
and unembellished, functional design. Le Corbusier's ideal 
city (La Ville Radieuse) featured linear clusters of high-density, 
medium-rise apartment blocks, elevated on stilts and segre-
gated from industrial districts; high-rise tower office blocks; 
and transportation routes—all separated by broad expanses of 
public open space.
After World War II, the International Style became 
pervasive in urban design. The box-like steel-frame build-
ings with concrete and glass facades were avant-garde yet 
respectable and, above all, comparatively inexpensive to build. 
This tradition of urban design, more than anything else, has 
imposed a measure of uniformity on cities around the world 
(Figure 12.13). Because of globalization International Style 
buildings have appeared in big cities in every part of the world. 
Furthermore, the International Style has often been the pre-
ferred style for large-scale urban design projects around the 
world. Modern urban design has had many critics, mainly on 
the grounds that it tends to take away the natural life and vital-
ity of cities, replacing varied and human-scale environments 
with monotonous and austere settings. In response, historic 
preservation has become an important element of urban plan-
ning in every city that can afford it.

ISLAMIC CITIES
Islamic cities provide good examples of how social and cultural 
values and people's responses to their environment are trans-
lated into spatial terms through the built environment. Because 
of similarities in cityscapes, layout, and design, geographers are 
able to talk about the Islamic city as a meaningful category. It 
is a category that includes thousands of towns and cities, not 
only in the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East—the heart 
of the Islamic Empire under the prophet  Muhammad (570-632 
C.E.)—but also in regions into which Islam spread later: North 
Africa, coastal East Africa, South-Central Asia, and Indonesia. 
Most cities in North Africa and South-Central Asia are Islamic, 
and many elements of the classic Islamic city can be found in 
towns and cities as far away as Seville, Granada, and  Córdoba in 
southern Spain (the western extent of Islam), Kano in northern 
Nigeria and Dar es Salaam in Tanzania (the southern  extent), 
and Davao in the Philippines (the eastern extent).
The fundamentals of the layout and design of the tradi-
tional Islamic city are so closely attached to Islamic cultural 
values that they are referenced in the Qur'an, the holy book 
of Islam. Although urban growth in the Islamic world does 
not have to conform to any overall master plan or layout, cer-
tain basic regulations and principles are intended to support 
 Islam's emphasis on personal privacy and virtue, on communal 
well-being, and on the inner essence of things rather than on 
their outward appearance.
The most dominant feature of the traditional Islamic city 
is the Jami—the principal mosque (Figure 12.14). Located cen-
trally, the mosque complex is a center not only of worship but 
also of education and the hub of a broad range of welfare func-
tions. As cities grow, new, smaller mosques are built toward 
the edge of the city, each out of earshot of the call to prayer 
from the Jami and from one another. The traditional Islamic 
city was walled for defense, with several lookout towers and 
a Kasbah, or citadel (fortress), containing palace buildings, 
baths, barracks, and its own small mosque and shops.
Traditionally, gates controlled access to the city, allowing 
careful scrutiny of strangers and permitting the imposition of 
taxes on merchants. The major streets led from these gates to 
the main covered bazaars or street markets (suqs, Figure 12.15). 
The suqs nearest the Jami typically specialize in the cleanest 
and most prestigious goods, such as books, perfumes, prayer 
mats, and modern consumer goods. Those nearer the gates fea-
ture bulkier and less valuable goods such as basic foodstuffs, 
▲ Figure 12.13 International Style The Total office tower buildings at La 
Défense, Paris.

building materials, textiles, leather goods, and pots and pans.  
Within the suqs, every profession and line of business had 
its own alley, and the residential districts around the suqs 
are organized into distinctive quarters, or ahya', according to 
occupation (or sometimes ethnicity, tribal affiliation, or reli-
gious sect).
Privacy is central to the construction of the Islamic city. 
Above all, women must be protected, according to Islamic 
values, from the gaze of unrelated men. Traditionally, doors 
must not face each other across a minor street, and windows 
must be small, narrow, and above eye level. Cul-de-sacs 
(dead-end streets) are used where possible to restrict the 
number of persons approaching the home. Angled entrances 
prevent intrusive glances. Larger homes are built around 
courtyards, which provide an interior and private focus for 
domestic life.
The rights of others are also emphasized in Islamic urban 
design. The Qur'an specifies an obligation to neighborly co-
operation and consideration—traditionally this consideration 
is interpreted as applying to a minimum radius of 40 houses. 
Roofs, in traditional designs, are surrounded by parapets to 
preclude views of neighbors' homes, and drainage channels 
are steered away from neighbors' houses. Refuse and wastewa-
ter are carefully recycled. Public thoroughfares were originally 
designed to be wide enough to allow two fully laden camels to 
pass each other and high enough to accommodate a camel and 
rider. The overall result is a compact, cellu-
lar urban structure within which it is pos-
sible to maintain a high degree of privacy  
(Figure 12.16).
Because most Islamic cities are located 
in hot, dry climates, these basic principles 
of urban design have evolved in conjunction 
with certain practical solutions to intense 
heat and sunlight. Twisting streets, as nar-
row as permissible, help to maximize shade, 
as do latticework on windows and a cellu-
lar residential courtyard design. In some re-
gions, local architectural styles include air 
ducts and roof funnels with adjustable shut-
ters that can be used to create dust-free drafts  
(Figure 12.17).

domes.

While all these features are still characteristic of Is-
lamic cities, they are most evident in the old cores, or me-
dinas. Like cities everywhere, however, Islamic cities also 
bear the imprint of globalization. Although Islamic culture 
is self-consciously opposed to many aspects of globaliza-
tion, it has been unable to resist altogether the penetration 
of the world economy and the infusion of the Western-based 
culture of global metropolitanism. The result can be seen in 
international hotels, skyscrapers and office blocks, modern 
factories, highways, airports, and stores. Indeed, the leading 
cities of some oil-rich states have become the "shock cities" 
of the early twenty-first century, with phenomenal rates of 
growth characterized by breathtakingly ambitious architec-
tural and urban design projects (see Box 12.3, "Window on 
the World: Doha, Qatar"). Meanwhile, Islamic culture and 
urban design principles have not always been able to cope 
with the pressures of contemporary rates of urbanization, so 
the larger Islamic cities in less-affluent states—cities such as 
Algiers, Cairo, Karachi, and Teheran—now share with other 
peripheral cities the common denominators of unmanageable 
size, shanty and squatter development, and low-income mass 
housing. In the next section of the  chapter, we examine the 
problems of large and rapidly growing  metropolises through-
out the periphery.

are taken through architecture and 
urban design to ensure the privacy of 
individuals, especially women. Entrances 
are L-shaped and  staggered across the 
street from one another. Windows are 
often placed above  pedestrian access. 
Architectural details also reflect climatic 
influences: window screens and nar-
row, twisting streets maximize shade, 
while air ducts and roof funnels create 
dust-free drafts, as in this photograph

CHAPTER 12   City Spaces:  Urban Structure    473
CITIES OF THE PERIPHERY: DUALISM
The cities of the world-system periphery, often still referred 
to as Third World cities, are numerous and varied. What they 
have in common is the experience of unprecedented rates of 
growth driven by rural "push"—overpopulation and the lack 
of employment opportunities in rural areas—rather than the 
"pull" of prospective jobs in towns and cities. Faced with pov-
erty in overpopulated rural areas, many people regard moving 
to a city much like playing a lottery: You buy a ticket (in other 
words, go to the city) in the hope of hitting the jackpot (in other 
words, landing a good job). As with all lotteries, most people 
lose, and the net result is widespread underemployment. Un-
deremployment occurs when people work less than full-time 
even though they would prefer to work more hours. Underem-
ployment is difficult to measure with any degree of accuracy, 
but estimates commonly range from 30 to 50 percent of the em-
ployed workforce in many peripheral cities.
Because of their rapid growth and high underemployment, 
the peripheral metropolises of the world, the shock cities of 
the late twentieth century—Mexico City (Mexico), São Paulo 
(Brazil), Lagos (Nigeria), Mumbai (India; formerly Bombay, 
Figure 12.18), Dhaka (Bangladesh), Jakarta (Indonesia), Karachi 
(Pakistan), and Manila (the Philippines)—embodied the most 
remarkable and unprecedented changes in economic, social, 
and cultural life. Socioeconomic conditions in parts of these 
cities are still shocking, in the sense of being deplorably bad, 
but they are no longer shocking in the sense of being unprec-
edented. Rather, they have become all too familiar.
Recall from Chapter 10 that peripheral metropolises play 
a key role in international economic flows, linking provincial 
regions with the hierarchy of world cities and, thus, with the 
global economy. Within peripheral metropolises, this role re-
sults in a pronounced dualism, or juxtaposition in geographic 
space of the formal and informal sectors of the economy. This 
dualism is evidenced by the contrast between high-rise mod-
ern office and apartment towers and luxurious homes and the 
slums and shantytowns (Figure 12.19).
The Informal Economy
In many peripheral cities, more than one-third of the popula-
tion is engaged in the informal sector of the urban economy, 
and in some—for example Chennai, India; Colombo, Sri Lanka; 
Delhi, India; Guayaquil, Ecuador; and Lahore, Pakistan—the 
figure is more than one-half. The informal sector of an econ-
omy involves a wide variety of economic activities whose com-
mon feature is that they take place beyond official record and 
are not subject to formalized systems of regulation or remuner-
ation. People who cannot find regularly paid work must resort 
to various ways of gleaning a living. Some of these ways are 
imaginative, some desperate. Examples range from street vend-
ing (Figure 12.20), shoe shining, craft work, and street-corner 
repairs to scavenging in garbage dumps (Figure 12.21). Children 
represent a significant element of the informal economy. For 
hundreds of thousands of street kids in less developed coun-
tries, "work" means anything that contributes to survival: shin-
ing shoes, guiding cars into parking spaces, chasing other street 
kids away from patrons at an outdoor café, working as domes-
tic help, making fireworks, or selling drugs. Occupations such 
as selling souvenirs, driving pedicabs, making home-brewed 
beer, writing letters for others, and dressmaking may seem mar-
ginal from the point of view of the global economy, but more 
than a billion people around the world must feed, clothe, and 
house themselves entirely from such occupations. Across Af-
rica, the International Labor Office estimates, informal-sector 
employment is growing 10 times faster than formal-sector em-
ployment. The informal sector represents an important coping 
mechanism. For too many, however, coping means resorting to 
begging, crime, or prostitution.
◀ Figure 12.18 Mumbai, 
India

In most peripheral countries, the informal labor force in-
cludes children. In environments of extreme poverty, every 
family member must contribute something, and so children are 
expected to do their share. Industries in the formal sector of-
ten take advantage of this situation. Many firms farm out their 
production under subcontracting schemes that are based not in 
factories but in home settings that use child workers. In these 
settings, labor standards are nearly impossible to enforce. In 
the Philippines, for example, batches of rural children are fer-
ried by syndicates to work in garment-manufacturing sweat-
shops in urban areas.

economic growth or help alleviate poverty, it 
does keep companies competitive within the 
context of the global economic system. For 
export-oriented companies, in particular, the 
informal sector provides a considerable indi-
rect subsidy to production. This subsidy is of-
ten passed on to consumers in the core regions 
in the form of lower prices for goods and con-
sumer products made in the periphery.
Consider, for example, the paper in-
dustry in Cali, Colombia. This industry is 
dominated by one company, Cartón de Co-
lombia, which was established in 1944 
with North American capital and subse-
quently acquired by the Mobil Oil Com-
pany. Most of the company's lower-quality 
paper products are made from recycled 
waste paper. Sixty percent of this waste  
paper is gathered by the 1,200 to 1,500 gar-
bage pickers in Cali. Some work the city's 
municipal waste dump, some work the alleys 
and yards of shopping and industrial areas, 
and some work the routes of municipal garbage trucks, inter-
cepting trash cans before the truck arrives. They are part of 
Cali's informal economy, for they are not employed by Cartón 
de Colombia nor do they have any sort of contract with the 
company or its representatives. They simply show up each 
day to sell their pickings. In this way the company avoids 
paying both wages and benefits and is able to dictate the price 
it will pay for various grades of waste paper. The company 
can operate profitably while keeping the price of its products 
down—the arrangement is a microcosm of core-periphery 
relationships.

Slums of Hope, Slums of Despair
The informal labor market is directly paralleled in informal 
shantytowns and squatter housing: Because there are insuf-
ficient jobs with regular wages in the cities of the periph-
ery, many families cannot afford rent or house payments for 
sound housing. Unemployment, underemployment, and pov-
erty mean overcrowding. In situations where urban growth 
has swamped the available stock of cheap housing and out-
stripped the capacity of builders to create affordable new 
housing, the inevitable outcome is makeshift shanty hous-
ing. Such housing has to be constructed on the cheapest and 
least desirable sites. Often this means building on bare rock,

 garbage at the Nong Khaem dump, Bangkok, Thailand.
The Informal Sector in Context Despite this side of 
the picture, the informal sector has positive aspects. Pedi-
cabs, for example, provide an affordable, nonpolluting 
means of transportation in crowded metropolitan settings. 
Garbage picking provides an important means of recycling 
paper, steel, glass, and plastic products. One study of Mex-
ico City estimated that as much as 25 percent of the mu-
nicipal waste ends up being  recycled by the 15,000 or so 
scavengers who work over the city's official dump sites. 
This positive contribution to the economy, though, scarcely 
justifies the lives of poverty and degradation experienced 
by the scavengers. Meanwhile, it should be noted that even 
in the formal sector wages can be  extremely low and work-
ing conditions dangerous (see Box 12.4: "Spatial Inequality: 
Garment Workers in Dhaka").

Urban geographers also recognize that the informal sector 
represents an important resource to the formal sector of periph-
eral economies. The informal sector provides a vast range of

wages low. Although this network does not contribute to urban

Doha, the capital of Qatar, owes its 
growth to the world's appetite for  fossil 
fuels. For centuries it was a small port, 
relying on fishing and the trade routes of 
the Indian Ocean. (Figure 12.D) Qatar's 
oil and gas reserves,  controlled by the 
country's ruling elite, began to transform 
the city in the mid- twentieth century but 
it was only in the 1990s that the Emir of 
Qatar, Hamad Bin  Khalifa Al Thani, em-
barked on an extravagant strategy of 
economic and  urban  development based 
on a combination of oil and gas revenues 
and an  aggressively pro-business regime 
based on lax labor laws and malleable 
financial regulations. Doha grew from 
around 500,000 inhabitants in the late 
1990s to more than 1.5 million in 2013. 
Most of Doha's residents—about two-
thirds of them—are foreigners: thousands 
of professionals and tens of thousands of 
laborers who have been drawn to Qatar to 
build the city. 
The real estate boom created a new sky-
line of office and residential towers in the 
space of less than 10 years. It also created 
a very unequal society, with super-affluent 
Qataris and well-paid foreign professionals 
but miserably paid migrant laborers. (Fig-
ure 12.E) Zones, partitions, walls, enclaves, 
and compounds are characteristic aspects 
of modern Doha. Government investment 
has created a series of planned districts, each 
with prescribed functions. These include 
the Pearl-Qatar, a vast urban development 
consisting of fifteen thousand upscale dwell-
ings (Figure 12.F); a Diplomatic Quarter;  
Education City, a conglomeration of Euro-
American universities and research institu-
tions; an Aspire Zone, devoted to sports 
stadia and other athletic facilities (Figure 
12.G); and an Industrial Area on the pe-
riphery of the city where tens of thousands 
of transnational laborers live in dormitory 
camps amidst a checkerboard of industry.

Meanwhile, Qatar's rulers have sought to elevate Doha's status from an 
oil- and gas-based welfare enclave to a world city with global recognition 
and influence. The strategy has been to establish the city as a global service 
hub, developing media, sports, and cultural facilities and events in order to 
brand the city as an international service center. One of the first develop-
ments, in the mid-1990s, was the establishment of the now-influential news 
group, Al Jazeera. Since then, the city has hosted academic, religious, political, 
and economic conferences and a broad range of high-profile sports events. 
Improbably, Qatar was selected to host the finals of the 2022 football World 
Cup after promising to splurge billions of dollars in building air-conditioned 
stadiums (with both the Qataris and the organizers conveniently neglecting 
the fact that much of what is enjoyable about a World 
Cup happens outside, in the streets, bars, and plazas of 
host cities).
The Qatari elite has also asserted its global influ-
ence through overseas investments. Barcelona's foot-
ball club has been sponsored by the Qatar Foundation 
and  Qatar Airways, while another prominent football 
club, Paris St-Germain, was bought in 2011 by the 
state-owned Qatar Sports Investments. The  Qatar 
Investment Authority and its partners have mean-
while reached beyond Doha to acquire trophy real 
estate assets in major cities. In London, for example, 
these include the 87-story Shard building, the super-
luxury One Hyde Park complex (where one buyer 
reputedly paid £140 million pounds—more than U.S. 
$225  million—for a penthouse apartment), Harrods 
department store, the entire 2012 Olympic Village, and 
the former U.S.  embassy building.
Meanwhile, back in Doha, the attempt to buy in-
ternational economic and cultural standing has been 
severely compromised by the country's questionable 
human rights record and the scandalous conditions endured by the low-
paid migrants working on World Cup facilities and real estate developments. 
According to official figures, more than 430 Nepalese and 560 Indian work-
ers died between January 2012 and mid-April 2014.

in the world, Dharavi provides a cheap and affordable option 
to those who move to Mumbai to earn their living. Rents can 
be as low as 185 rupees ($4) per month. Recycling is one of 
the slum's biggest industries. In Dharavi nothing is considered 
garbage. Thousands of tons of scrap plastic, metals, paper, cot-
ton, soap, and glass revolve through Dharavi each day. Ruined 
plastic toys are tossed into massive grinders, chopped into 
tiny pieces, and melted down into multicolored pellets, ready 
to be refashioned into knockoff Barbie dolls. Dharavi also 
houses about 15,000 hutment factories, each typically staffed 
with children as well as adults sewing cotton, melting plastic, 
hammering iron, molding clay, or producing embroidered gar-
ments, export-quality leather goods, pottery, and plastic. The 
aggregate annual turnover of these businesses is estimated to 
be more than $650 million a year.
Yet in spite of all these positives, conditions for Dharavi's 
residents are miserable. Most people have food intakes of less 
than the recommended minimum of 1,500 calories a day; 90 
percent of all infants and children under 4 have less than the 
minimum calories needed for a healthy diet. More than half of 
the children and almost half the adults have intestinal worm 
infections. Infant and child mortality is high—though nobody 
knows just how high—with malaria, tetanus, diarrhea, dys-
entery, and cholera as the principal causes of death among 
under-fives.
Slum Clearance Programs Faced with the growth of 
slums, the first response of many governments has been to erad-
icate them. Encouraged by Western development economists

tended urbanization through large-scale eviction and clearance 
programs. In Caracas (Venezuela), Lagos (Nigeria), Bangkok

over ravines, on derelict land, on swamps, or on steep slopes. 
Nearly always it means building without any basic infrastruc-
ture of streets or utilities. Shacks are constructed out of any 
material that comes to hand, such as planks, cardboard, tar 
paper, thatch, mud, and corrugated iron. Many of these in-
stant slums are squatter settlements, built illegally by fami-
lies who are desperate for shelter. Squatter settlements are 
residential developments on land that is neither owned nor 
rented by its occupants. Squatter settlements are often, but 
not always, slums. In Chile, squatter settlements are called 
callampas, "mushroom cities," while in Turkey, they are 
called gecekondu, meaning that they were built after dusk 
and before dawn. In India, they are called bustees; in Tuni-
sia, gourbevilles; in Brazil, favelas; and in Argentina, simply 
villas miserias. These settlements typically account for well 
over one-third and sometimes up to three-quarters of the pop-
ulation of major cities (Figure 12.22).
Many of them are "slums of despair," where overcrowd-
ing, lack of adequate sanitation, and lack of maintenance lead 
to shockingly high levels of ill health and infant mortality and 
where social pathologies are at their worst. In many cities, 
more than half of the housing is substandard. The United Na-
tions estimated in 2013 that more than a billion people world-
wide live in inadequate housing in urban areas.

neighborhoods where self-help and community organization

1 square mile in size and home to over a million people. This 
means that as many as 18,000 people crowd into each single 
acre of land. In a city where house rents are among the highest

12.4 Spatial Inequality 
Garment Workers in Dhaka
Garment workers are the mainstay of the formal economy in Dhaka, the capi-
tal of Bangladesh. They stand at the beginning of a supply chain that ends 
with the customers of stores like H&M, Old Navy, and Banana Republic in 
Europe and North America. The circumstances of producers and consum-
ers could hardly be more unequal. Dhaka's garment workers—mostly young 
women—work in sweatshop conditions, in dangerously overcrowded, 
 rickety factories with nothing by way of health and safety protection  
(Figure 12.H). Their wages for an 8-hour day, 6-day week are less than $10 
per week. Two or three hours of compulsory overtime just about every 
day can bring this figure up to $16-$22 per week. During big production 
runs and peak seasons, the women are required to work until 1 am or later 
and still expected to return the following morning at 8:00 am. They are not 
 allowed to take sick days, and in some factories they are rarely paid on time.
Their terrible working conditions were widely publicized in the wake of the 
collapse of a factory building in April 2013 that killed 1,129 and injured a fur-
ther 2,515. The disaster led to widespread discussions about corporate respon-
sibility across global supply chains and demands for labor law reform. Thanks 
largely to local union organization, assisted by the AFL-CIO's Solidarity Center 
and the International Labor Organization, an increase of more than 75 percent 
in garment workers' minimum wage has been announced; though it has still to 
be enacted and even if it is, it will still be the lowest minimum wage in the world.

(Thailand), Kolkata (India; formerly Calcutta),  Manila (the Phil-
ippines), and scores of other cities in the periphery, hundreds of 
thousands of shanty dwellers were ordered out on short notice 
and their homes bulldozed to make way for public works, land 
speculation, luxury housing, and urban renewal and, on occa-
sion, to improve the appearance of cities for special visitors. 
Seoul, South Korea, has probably had the most forced evictions 
of any city in the world. Since 1966, as part of sustained gov-
ernment clean-up campaigns millions of people in Seoul have 
been forced out of accommodations that they owned or rented. 
The Beijing Olympics in 2008 displaced 1.5 million people, 
according to the Geneva-based Centre on Housing Rights and 
Evictions (COHRE). Its report4 blames the Chinese government 
for widespread forced evictions along with other  human rights 
violations during preparations for the Olympics.

Yet Seoul and Beijing, more than most other cit-
ies, could afford to build new low-income housing  
to replace the demolished neighborhoods. Most peripheral cit-
ies cannot do so, which means that displaced slum dwellers 
have no option but to create new squatter and shanty settle-
ments elsewhere in the city. Most cities, in fact, cannot evict 
and demolish fast enough to keep pace with the growth of slums 
caused by in-migration. The futility of slum clearance has led to 
a widespread reevaluation of the wisdom of such policies. The 
thinking now is that informal-sector housing should be seen 
as a rational response to poverty. Shanty and squatter neigh-
borhoods not only provide affordable shelter but also func-
tion as important reception areas for migrants to the city, with 
 supportive communal organizations and informal employment 
opportunities that help them to adjust to city life. They can, in 
other words, be "slums of hope." City authorities, recognizing 
the positive functions of informal housing, are now increasingly 
disposed to be tolerant and even helpful to squatters rather than 
sending in police and municipal workers with bulldozers.
In fact, many informal settlements are the product of 
 careful planning. In parts of Latin America, for example, it is 
common for community activists to draw up plans for  invading 
unused land and then quickly build shanty housing before 
landowners can react. The activists' strategy is to organize a 
critical mass of people large enough to be able to negotiate with 
the authorities to resist eviction. It is also common for activists 
to plan their invasions for public holidays so that the risk of 
early detection is minimized. As the risk of eviction  diminishes 
over time, some residents of informal housing are able to grad-
ually improve their dwellings through self-help (Figure 12.23).
The Challenges of Growth
Globalization has greatly stimulated the formal economic sec-
tor of many peripheral cities, bringing new levels of affluence 
and consumption that in turn have created significant chal-
lenges in terms of infrastructure and environmental quality. 
Peripheral cities have always been congested, but in recent 
years the modernizing influence of growing formal-sector 
 activities has turned the congestion into near gridlock. Sharp 
increases have occurred in the availability and use of automo-
biles. India, for example, has become one of the world's fastest-
growing automobile markets. More than 2.7 million cars were 
sold there in 2013. Yet India's transportation infrastructure has 
not caught up with this sudden growth, nor have its drivers. 
The auto accident rate is the highest in the world. India has 
about 1 percent of the world's cars yet still manages to kill over 
100,000 people in traffic accidents each year: about 10 percent 
of the entire world's traffic fatalities.
Not only are there more people and more traffic but the 
changing spatial organization of peripheral cities has increased 
the need for transportation. Traditional patterns of land use 
have been superseded by the agglomerating tendencies inher-
ent in modern industry and the segregating tendencies inher-
ent in modernizing societies. The greatest single change has 
been the separation of home from work, however, which has 
meant a significant increase in commuting.
Governments have invested in expensive new freeways 
and street-widening schemes, and some cities boast ultra-
modern transit systems (Figure 12.24). But new freeways and 
transit systems still disgorge into a congested and chaotic mix-
ture of motorized traffic, bicycles, animal-drawn vehicles, and 
hand-drawn carts. Some of the worst traffic tales come from 
Mexico City—where traffic backups total more than 90 kilome-
ters (60 miles) each day, on average—and Bangkok, where the 
24-kilometer (15-mile) trip into town from Don Muang Airport 
can take 3 hours. In São Paulo, Brazil, gridlock can span 160 
kilometers (100 miles), rush-hour traffic jams average 85 kilo-
meters (53 miles) in length, and 15-hour traffic jams are not 
unusual. The costs of these traffic backups are enormous. The 
annual costs of traffic delays in Singapore have been estimated 
at $305 million; in Bangkok, Thailand, they have been esti-
mated at $272 million—the equivalent of around 1 percent of 
Thailand's gross national product.
◀ Figure 12.23 Self-help as a solution to 
housing problems Self-help is often the 
only solution to housing problems because 
wages are so low and so scarce that builders 
cannot construct even the most inexpensive 
new housing and make a profit and because 
municipalities cannot afford to build sufficient 
quantities of subsidized housing. Municipal 
authorities can encourage self-help housing 
by creating the preconditions: clearing sites, 
putting in the footings for small dwellings, 
and installing a basic framework of water and 
sewage utilities. This "sites-and-services" ap-
proach has become the mainstay of urban 
housing policies in many peripheral countries.

CHAPTER 12   City Spaces:  Urban Structure    481
Air Pollution Meanwhile, because of the speed of economic 
and demographic growth, environmental problems can es-
calate rapidly. Air pollution has reached very harmful levels 
in many cities. With the development of a modern industrial 
sector and the growth of automobile ownership, but without 
enforceable regulations on pollution and vehicle emissions, 
tons of lead, sulfur oxides, fluorides, carbon monoxide, nitro-
gen oxides, petrochemical oxidants, and other toxic chemicals 
are pumped into the atmosphere every day in large cities. The 
burning of charcoal, wood, and kerosene for fuel and cooking 
in informal-sector neighborhoods also contributes significantly 
to dirty air. In cities where sewerage systems are deficient, the 
problem is compounded by the presence of airborne dried fecal 
matter. Worldwide, according to UN data, more than 1.1 billion 
people live in urban areas where air pollution exceeds health-
ful levels.
WHO studies demonstrate that it is unhealthy for human 
beings to breathe air with more than 100 to 120 parts per bil-
lion (ppb) of ozone contaminants for more than one day a year. 
Yet Mexico City residents breathe this level, or more, for over 
300 days a year. In Bangkok, Thailand, where air pollution is 
almost as severe as in Mexico City, research has shown that 
lead-bearing air pollutants reduce children's IQ by an aver-
age of 3.5 points per year until they are 7 years old. It has also 
been estimated that Bangkok's pall of dust and smoke causes 
more than 1,400 deaths annually and $3.1 billion each year in 
lost productivity resulting from traffic- and pollution-linked 
illnesses. In Manila, the Philippines, the Asian Development 
Bank found levels of suspended particulate matter in the air 
to be 200-400 percent above guideline levels. The World Bank 
has cited China as having 16 of the 20 most air-polluted cities 
on Earth (Figure 12.25). China's spectacular economic growth 
has brought with it air pollution levels that are blamed for up 
to 1.2 million premature deaths a year. Until recently, China's 
domestic politics meant that public discussion of air pollution 
was suppressed. Chinese officials who had been collecting air 
pollution data had refused to release it until they came under 
pressure from the public who saw that the US Embassy in Bei-
jing was measuring the levels hourly and posting the data in a 
Twitter feed, @BeijingAir.

The future of North American cities in the 
next 10-20 years or so seems relatively easy 
to predict. In spite of many ideas about ur-
ban planning and the prospect of new and 
improved transportation, the patterns and 
problems described in this chapter seem set 
to continue. The reasons are straightforward. 
Demographic trends are established and 
 accessibility, agglomeration, territoriality, 
congregation, segregation, and sprawl will 
continue to shape people's behavior. In North 
American cities, continuing fiscal constraints 
dictate that infrastructure problems will con-
tinue and likely intensify. The political and 
financial interests behind the "sprawl ma-
chine" ensure a continuation of polycentric,

CONCLUSION
Patterns of land use and the functional organization of eco-
nomic and social subareas in cities are partly a product of eco-
nomic, political, and technological conditions at the time of 
the city's growth, partly a product of regional cultural values, 
and partly a product of processes of globalization. Geographers 
can draw on several perspectives in looking at patterns of land 
use within cities, including an economic perspective that em-
phasizes competition for space and a sociocultural perspective 
that emphasizes ethnic congregation and segregation. Never-
theless, urban structure varies considerably because of the in-
fluence of history, culture, and the different roles that different 
cities have played within the world-system.
The evolution of the unintended metropolis of the periph-
ery has been very different from the evolution of metropolitan 
areas in the world's core regions. Similarly, the problems they 
have faced are very different. In the core regions, the conse-
quences of an economic transformation to a postindustrial 
economy have dominated urban change. Traditional manufac-
turing and related activities have been moved out of central 
cities, leaving decaying neighborhoods and a residual popula-
tion of elderly and marginalized people. New, postindustrial 
activities have begun to cluster in redeveloped CBDs and in 
edge cities around metropolitan fringes. In a few cases, metro-
politan growth has become so complex and extensive that 100-
mile cities have begun to emerge, with half a dozen or more 
major commercial and industrial centers forming the nuclei of 
a series of interdependent urban realms.
In other parts of the world, traditional patterns of land use and 
the functional organization of economic and social subareas have 
been quite different, reflecting different historical legacies and 
different environmental and cultural influences. A basic trend af-
fecting the cities of the world's periphery is demographic—the 
phenomenal rates of natural increase and in-migration. An ever-
growing informal sector of the economy, in which people seek 
economic survival, is reflected in extensive areas of shanty hous-
ing. High rates of unemployment, underemployment, and pov-
erty generate acute social problems, which are overwhelming for 
city governments that are understaffed and underfunded. If pres-
ent trends continue, such problems are likely to characterize in-
creasing numbers of the world's largest settlements. Meanwhile, 
globalization processes are recasting metropolitan structure and 
intensifying social and economic inequalities.
metroburban development. The past 200 years of economic, 
social, and urban history provide no reason at all to expect 
any mitigation of urban poverty or neighborhood decay. This 
is borne out by the survey conducted by the Society for Ameri-
can City and Regional Planning History cited at the beginning 
of this chapter. Their respondents envisage a continuation and 
even intensification of the urban problems that have character-
ized the past 50 years, including growing disparities of wealth, 
a perpetual urban underclass, the physical deterioration of 
first-ring post-1945 suburbs, and continued sprawl into new 
peripheral edge cities (Table 12.2). Some respondents, how-
ever, predicted that smart growth policies would help preserve 
the environment and limit sprawl; this group also believed that 
cities would overcome racial and class divisions to become 
more diverse than they are now.
The basic templates of urban structure are equally well 
established in both European and Islamic cities. Change will 
likely be marginal, even as economic and demographic modi-
fications take place and as the impact of new technologies— 
electric cars, perhaps—alter the locational behavior of people 
and businesses. We can apply a similar logic to the unintended 
metropolises of the periphery. Faced with continuing streams of 
migration as well as high rates of natural increase among their 
relatively youthful populations, the megacities of the periphery 
will continue to expand, virtually unchecked. Informal eco-
nomic activities will continue to have an important role, and 
cityscapes will continue to be dominated by stark contrasts be-
tween the towers of international business and elite residences 
on the one hand, and slums and informal housing on the other. 
Sheer pressure of numbers will ensure continuing problems of 
congestion, water supply, sanitation, and environmental degra-
dation. What is less predictable is how individual cities might 
change as a result of the introduction of progressive planning 
policies or new transportation systems or—from a more pes-
simistic perspective—as a result of localized economic prob-
lems, political unrest, or environmental disasters.

CHAPTER 12   City Spaces:  Urban Structure    483
LEARNING OUTCOMES REVISITED
■ Assess how the internal structure of cities is shaped by compe-
tition for territory and location.
In general, all categories of land users—commercial 
and industrial, as well as residential—compete for the 
most convenient and accessible locations within the 
city. An important exception is that wealthier house-
holds tend to trade off the convenience of accessibility 
for the greater utility of being able to consume larger 
amounts of (relatively cheap) suburban space. Poorer 
households, unable to afford the recurrent costs of 
transportation, trade off living space for accessibility  
to jobs.
■ State the ways in which social patterns in cities are influenced 
by human territoriality.
Territoriality provides a means of establishing and preserv-
ing group membership and identity. Processes of congre-
gation and discrimination often result in segregation, the 
spatial separation of specific subgroups within a wider 
population. Segregation varies a great deal in both inten-
sity and form. Consider how social patterns are dynamic 
and how different communities can both occupy and tran-
sition from an area.
■ Describe the spatial structure of the typical North American 
city.
Most larger cities are structured around a central busi-
ness district (CBD); a transitional zone; suburbs; secondary 
business districts and commercial strips; and industrial 
districts. In larger metropolitan areas, a polycentric struc-
ture is typical, with "edge cities," new business centers, 
and specialized subcenters. The internal organization of 
cities reflects the way that they function, both to bring 
certain people and activities together and to sort them out 
into neighborhoods and functional subareas. During the 
middle decades of the twentieth century, North American 
cities were reshaped by the combination of increased au-
tomobility, federal outlays on highway construction, and 
federal mortgage insurance programs that promoted home 
ownership. The resulting spurt of city building produced 
a dispersed spatial structure and the emergence of a poly-
centric metropolitan structure.
■ Compare and contrast urban structures in different regions  
of the world.
Urban structure varies considerably because of the influ-
ence of history, culture, and the different roles that cities 
have played within the world-system. European cities 
have evolved under circumstances very different from 
those in American cities and consequently exhibit some 
distinctive characteristics that reflect their history. Islamic 
cities provide examples of how social and cultural values 
and people's responses to their environment are translated 
into spatial terms through urban form and the design of 
the built environment. The new cities of the world's pe-
ripheral regions are characterized and shaped by explosive 
growth.
■ Explain the nature and causes of the problems associated with 
urbanization in various world regions.
The most acute problems of the cities of the world's core 
regions are localized in the central city areas that have 
borne the brunt of restructuring from an industrial to a 
postindustrial economy, while the problems of the cities 
of the periphery stem from the way in which their demo-
graphic growth has outstripped their economic growth. The 
central city districts of cities in the world's core regions 
typically experience several interrelated problems: fiscal 
problems, infrastructure problems, and localized spirals of 
neighborhood decay and cycles of poverty. In peripheral 
cities high rates of long-term unemployment and under-
employment, low and unreliable wages of informal-sector 
jobs, chronic poverty, and slum housing are common.

REVIEW & DISCUSSION
1. Research the different ethnic groups in your city or town. 
Examine the data through the lenses of congregation and 
territorial and residential clustering of the different ethnic 
groups. Identify where these different groups congregated. 
How has the congregation of the ethnic groups changed 
over the past ten years? Does a pattern of discrimination 
or segregation emerge or would you identify the change as 
invasion and succession? Explain your observations in a 
paragraph.
2. Conduct research on home-based workers in any city of 
the developing world. Find out about their living and 
work conditions in terms of the infrastructural facilities 
and civic amenities they have access to. How do you think 
home-based workers contribute to the economy of these 
cities? What strategies, do you think, could be adopted to 
bring change in their living and work conditions?
 3. Create a list of the various modes of transportation that are 
commonly available in your community. List three ways 
that the transportation shapes your city or town. Identify 
two major problems with the current transportation con-
figuration of your city (Hint: Compare how long it takes 
a person to get from point A to B using various modes 
of transportation.) Think about whether certain types of 
transportation are facilitated more than others? In other 
words, are bus routes widespread and frequent? Are there 
separate streets for bicycles? Do you have high occupancy 
vehicle lanes for carpooling? Also consider the terrain 
itself: Do you have elevation or natural landscape consid-
erations (mountains, water ways) to negotiate getting from 
point A to B? On a piece of paper map out how these prob-
lems could be corrected.
UNPLUGGED
1. Collect a week's worth of local newspapers and review 
the coverage of urban problems. What kinds of problems 
in what kinds of communities are covered? Compile a list 
of the different categories of problems, and then carefully 
analyze the content of the week's coverage, calculating 
the number of column inches devoted to each category. 
Compare how issues in different communities are reported 
and supported by local officials. Are some problems con-
sidered "fixable" and others just part of life in that commu-
nity? How empowered are different communities in your 
city to fix these issues?
2. On a tracing-paper overlay of a street map of your town 
or city, plot the distribution of houses and apartments for 
sale or rent in different price brackets. (You can obtain the 
information from the real estate pages of your city's local 
newspaper; in smaller cities you may have to gather data 
from several issues of the paper—your local library will 
likely have back issues.) Explain the spatial distributions 
that you observe and monitor. Have any of these areas re-
cently undergone gentrification? What do you notice about 
those areas?
 3. Most cities consist of "ordinary" cityscapes that are 
strongly evocative because they are widely understood as 
being a particular kind of place. Write a brief essay (500 
words, or two double-spaced, typed pages) describing an 
"ordinary" cityscape with which you are familiar. What are 
its principal features, and how might it be considered typi-
cal of a particular kind of place? What makes this cityscape 
"ordinary" and is there anything that makes the cityscape 
unique compared to other "ordinary" cityscapes? Why 
might we have a notion of an "ordinary" cityscape in the 
first place?

CHAPTER 12   City Spaces:  Urban Structure    485
In this chapter, we have looked at urban design 
and landscape spaces around the world. To look 
at the impact of different factors on cities Com-
pare the designs of three different cities around 
the globe by choosing 1) one world city; 2) one 
megacity; and 3) one former colonial city. Start by 
using Google Maps and pull up each of your cities.  
How do the aerial and street views compare on each space?  
Secondly, go to each of those city's websites and do an image 
search for each city you choose. As you pull up the data and 
images, answer these questions: 
 1. What are the main components of the urban design (Hint: 
this includes buildings, public space, streets, transport, 
and landscape)? 
 2. What are the transportation networks and flows of people 
in and out of each city to other cities and rural areas? 
 3. What are the religious traditions (Islamic, Buddhist, 
 Christian, etc.); historical events (like wars, fires or natural 
disasters); and environmental space (mountains, beaches 
or deserts) of each city? How do those aspects influence 
 urban design?
 4. Are any of your cities connected to each other— 
economically, culturally, historically? 
 5. Which of your cities is incorporating green policies in its 
design either in infrastructure, transportation, architecture, 
urban gardening? 
Finally, pull up the 2013 report, World Cities Culture Report 
(http://www.worldcitiescultureforum.com/sites/all/themes/
wccr/assets/pdfs/WCCR2013_low.pdf)
 6. What is the importance of culture to each of these 18 cities 
(Hint: Read the executive summary, pp. 8-11)?
 7. Choose three of these 18 cities from different parts of the 
world. What makes them similar and what makes them 
 different in their use of culture?
 8. Based on your overall analysis, what do you think are the 
most significant influences (social, cultural, economic, 
 religious, environmental) in the cities—and why?
