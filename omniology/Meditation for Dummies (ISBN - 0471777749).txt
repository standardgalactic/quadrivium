About the Author
Stephan Bodian has been practicing and teaching meditation for more than
30 years. His workshops on meditation and self-realization are offered
through Omega Institute and other learning centers, and his articles on medi-
tation and related themes appear regularly in national magazines. When he’s
not writing or teaching, Stephan practices an approach to counseling and
coaching that guides clients in using meditative techniques for inner explo-
ration and healing. A licensed psychotherapist, he’s available for phone con-
sultations worldwide through his Web site, www.stephanbodian.org.
Stephan first became interested in meditation in high school when he came
across the word Zen in a novel by Beat writer Jack Kerouac. After studying
Asian philosophy at Columbia University and doing graduate work at
Stanford, he took a leave of absence and went off to a Zen monastery in the
mountains near Big Sur, California, where he shaved his head and spent long
hours following his breath. Ordained a monk in 1974, he eventually became
director of training at the Zen Center of Los Angeles and resident teacher at a
small Zen center in San Diego before putting aside his robes in 1982 to pursue
a master’s degree in psychology — and a more ordinary life.
From 1984 to 1994 he was editor-in-chief of Yoga Journal, an award-winning
magazine devoted to yoga, meditation, and holistic health. His books include
Timeless Visions, Healing Voices, a collection of interviews of prominent
visionaries and healers; Living Yoga (with Georg Feuerstein), an anthology of
articles from Yoga Journal; and Buddhism For Dummies (with Jon Landaw), a
comprehensive, user-friendly introduction to one of the world’s great spiri-
tual traditions.
For more information on Stephan’s workshops, retreats, and phone counsel-
ing and coaching services, visit his Web site (www.stephanbodian.org).

Dedication
This book is dedicated to the great meditation masters and teachers in every
culture and age, who continue to show us the way through their wise and
compassionate example; and to you, dear reader: May the practice of medita-
tion bring you the peace, health, and happiness you seek!

Author’s Acknowledgments
I’d like to express my appreciation to the colleagues, teachers, and friends
who contributed to the creation of this book: my agent, Carol Susan Roth, for
sending the project my way; my Acquisitions Editor for the first edition,
Tammerly Booth, whose enthusiasm for the project never flagged; my Project
Editor for the first edition, Melba Hopper, keen-eyed yet always diplomatic;
Mikal Belicove, my Acquisitions Editor for the second edition, for agreeing
that the book would indeed be enriched by an instructional CD; the other
people who helped make the second edition possible, especially Acqusitions
Editor Mike Lewis, Project Editor Elizabeth Kuball, and Technical Editor Anna
Douglas.
I’d like to offer my special thanks to: Dean Ornish, M.D., whose pioneering
research has helped to change the face of modern medicine, for so graciously
providing the foreword; technical advisor Eleanor Criswell, Ed.D., professor
of psychology at Sonoma State University, who has generously supported and
critiqued my work over the years; Rick Shiner, old friend and recording engi-
neer extraordinaire, for producing the CD; Doug and Sandy McMaster, whose
heartful music (with the sounds of Hawaii’s Hanalei Bay in the background)
make my words so much more enjoyable to hear.
I’ve had the inestimable good fortune to study with some great meditation
teachers, without whom this book would never have been written. Any
wisdom that shines through these pages has been kindled by their patient
instruction. Deep bows especially to Shunryu Suzuki Roshi and Kobun Chino
Otogawa Roshi; to Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche and Drubwang Tsoknyi
Rinpoche; to my beloved “root teacher,” Jean Klein, who pointed directly to
the heart of meditation; and to Adyashanti, through whose loving words and
lucid presence the Buddha finally awakened to himself!
I would also like to thank the other Western writers and teachers whose work
has inspired and informed my own: Joan Borysenko, Pema Chodron, Jon
Kabat-Zinn, Jack Kornfield, Joel Levey, Stephen Levine, Byron Katie Rolle, and
Suzanne Segal.
On a day-to-day level, I relied on the love and support of my friends and
family. Barbara Green listened lovingly, helped ease my worried mind, and
provided indispensable material comfort; Katie Darling buoyed my spirits
when they sagged; my Thursday morning group (heart friends all) offered
spiritual and emotional sustenance; Caroline Palden Alioto gave friendshp
and wise counsel; and John Prendergast (who encouraged me to do the book
when I had my doubts) and old Zen buddy Roy Wiskar read portions of the
manuscript and provided useful and supportive feedback. Thank you, thank
you, to each and every one!

Foreword
T
he title of this book is a little misleading, because learning to meditate
was one of the smartest decisions I ever made.
Meditation is power. Whatever you do, meditation can help you to do it better.
For example, my colleagues and I demonstrated, for the first time, that the
progression of even severe coronary heart disease often can reverse when
people go on my program of comprehensive lifestyle changes. Although many
people believe that this program is based primarily on diet, meditation is
actually an equally important part of it.
So — why don’t more people meditate?
In Meditation For Dummies, 2nd Edition, Stephan Bodian helps dispel many of
the most common misconceptions about meditation.
Many people view meditation as:
In fact, meditation is:
Boring
Interesting
Esoteric
Familiar
Ascetic
Sensual
Unproductive
Extremely productive
Difficult
Natural
Wimpy
Powerful
Meditation is the practice and process of paying attention and focusing 
your awareness. When you meditate, a number of desirable things begin 
to happen — slowly, at first, and deepening over time. As I described in 
Love & Survival:
First, when you can focus your awareness, you gain more power. When you
concentrate any form of energy, including mental energy, you gain power.
When you focus your mind, you concentrate better. When you concentrate
better, you perform better. You can accomplish more, whether in the class-
room, in the board room, or in the athletic arena. Whatever you do, you can

do it more effectively when you meditate. It is for this reason that spiritual
teachers and texts often caution that one should begin the practice of medi-
tation only in the context of other spiritual practices and disciplines that help
develop compassion and wisdom to use properly this increased power.
Second, you enjoy your senses more fully. Although people sometimes view or
use meditation as an ascetic experience to control their senses, meditation
also can enhance your senses in ways that are profoundly sensual. Anything
that you enjoy — food, sex, music, art, massage, and so on — is greatly
enhanced by meditation. When you pay attention to something, it’s a lot
more enjoyable. Also, you don’t need as much of it to get the same degree of
pleasure, so you are more likely to enjoy without excess.
When you keep a wall around your heart to armor and protect it from pain, you
also diminish your capacity to feel pleasure. When your life is in a continual
rush, you may miss exquisite pleasures that exist from moment to moment.
Attention spans get shorter. The need for stimulation continually increases just
to feel anything. Meditation increases awareness and sensitivity; as such, it can
be an antidote to numbness and distraction.
Third, your mind quiets down and you experience an inner sense of peace, joy,
and well-being. When I first learned to meditate and began getting glimpses 
of inner peace, this experience changed my life. It redefined and reframed 
my experience. Before, I thought piece of mind came from getting and doing;
now, I understand that it comes from being. It is our true nature to be peace-
ful until we disturb it.
This is a radically different concept of where our happiness and our well-
being come from. In one of life’s great paradoxes, not being aware of this
truth, we often end up disturbing our inner peace while striving to get or to
do what we think will bring that same peace to us.
Fourth, you may directly experience and become more aware of the transcen-
dent interconnectedness that already exists. You may have a direct experience
of God or the universal Self, whatever name you give to this experience.
Meditation is simple in concept but difficult to master. Fortunately, you don’t
have to master meditation to benefit from it. You just have to practice. No
one ever really masters it completely, but even a few steps down that road
can make a meaningful difference. It is the process of meditation that makes 
it so beneficial, not how well you perform.
In my research studies, most of the participants reported much greater diffi-
culty practicing meditation than exercising or maintaining their diet. Why?
You have to eat; it’s just a question of what you eat. Meditation, on the other
hand, is not part of most people’s daily routine or experience. Exercise is
Meditation for Dummies, 2nd Edition 
xx

more familiar to people, and also there is a macho quality to exercise —
you’re out there really doing something, whereas meditation still has what
some of our research participants at first called the “wimp factor.” From out-
ward appearances, it looks as if you’re not doing anything when you medi-
tate. In fact, meditation is a powerful, active process.
There are many different types of meditation. It is found in all cultures and in
all religions all over the world — because it works. Truth is truth. While the
forms vary, certain principles almost always are found.
This attitude of paying attention can help transform everything we do into a
form of meditation. Whatever we do with concentration and awareness
becomes meditation.
As the editor of Yoga Journal for many years, Stephan Bodian has had the
opportunity to become familiar with many different approaches to medita-
tion and yoga. He has distilled the best of these here and gently leads you
step by step to discover a form and style of meditation that works best for
you.

Introduction
E
veryone seems to want to know how to meditate these days. From Baby
Boomers to Generation-Xers, anxious teens to aging retirees, harried
housewives to hurried executives, heart-attack sufferers to weekend athletes,
more and more people are seeking solutions for the stressful, time-urgent, over-
stimulated lives we lead. Because the media and mainstream medicine have
failed to provide satisfying answers, people are turning in increasing numbers
to time-honored practices like meditation for proven remedies to cure life’s ills.
Indeed, according to a 2005 Newsweek survey, nearly one-third of all adults in
the U.S. meditate daily. That’s tens of millions of people! Why do they bother?
Because it works. Whether you’re seeking greater focus to get your job done
more efficiently, less stress and more peace of mind, or a deeper appreciation
of the beauty and richness of life, the simple practice of sitting down and
turning your attention inward can do wonders for your body and your mind.
The truth is, you can learn the basics of meditation in five minutes. Just sit in
a comfortable position, straighten your back, breathe deeply, and follow your
breath. It’s as simple as that! If you do it regularly, you’ll find that it won’t be
long before you’re feeling more relaxed and enjoying life more. I speak from
personal experience — I’ve been practicing meditation and teaching it to
others for more than 30 years.
Simple though it may be, meditation also has tremendous subtlety and depth,
if you’re interested in pursuing it further. It’s a lot like painting — you can buy
your materials, take a few lessons, and have fun applying paint to paper. Or
you can attend classes at your local adult-ed center or community college,
specialize in a particular medium in art school, and make painting a central
part of your life. In meditation, as in art, you can keep it simple — just get up
every day and sit quietly for five or ten minutes — or you can explore the
subtleties to your heart’s content. It all depends on your needs, your inten-
tions, and your level of interest and passion.
About This Book
As a teacher of meditation, I’ve always been hard-pressed to come up with a
single book that teaches the basics, provides a comprehensive overview of

techniques and practices, and offers guidance in going deeper. Global sur-
veys generally ignore the nuts and bolts — what to focus on, how to sit, what
to do about your crazy mind. Books that teach you how to meditate tend to
offer just a few techniques. And those that show you how to explore the rich
inner world of meditation often have a sectarian spiritual perspective that
limits the breadth of their presentation. (In other words, you’d have to be a
Buddhist or a yogi or a Sufi to know what they’re talking about.)
Unlike any other book I’ve come across, this one covers all the bases. If
you’re looking for simple, easy-to-follow meditation instructions, you’ll find
state-of-the-art guidance here, filled with helpful tips from seasoned medita-
tors and time-honored wisdom from the great teachers of old. If you want to
get an overview of the meditation field before you zero in on a particular
method or teaching, you’ll catch a glimpse of the primary approaches avail-
able these days. If you’ve been meditating in a particular way and want to
expand your horizons to include other techniques, you’ll be pleased to dis-
cover that this book features dozens of different meditations for a variety of
purposes, drawn from a range of sources and traditions. And if you just want
to understand why other people meditate — your partner, your friends, the
guy in the office next to yours — jump onboard! You’ll discover whole chap-
ters on why people meditate and how you can benefit from meditation, too.
As a special bonus, this second edition includes an instructional CD in which
I guide you step by step through ten of the most powerful and effective medi-
tations described in the book. When you’ve had your fill of reading and want
something more experiential, you can sit down in a comfortable position, pop
in the disc, and let my voice lead you effortlessly through the complete medi-
tation process, from start to finish. What could be more accessible and user-
friendly than that?
This book is many things at once: an instructional manual, a survey course,
and a guidebook for deeper exploration. Feel free to read it from cover to
cover if you want, or just browse until you find the chapters that appeal to
you. Throughout the book, you’ll find meditations and exercises you can
experiment with and enjoy. Some of them are also offered on the CD, where
you can discover how to practice them directly without referring to the text.
The best thing about this book, in my humble estimation, is that it’s fun to
read. Meditation doesn’t have to be a dull or somber affair. Quite the con-
trary: The whole point of meditating in the first place is to lighten up and
experience more peace and joy in your life. So forget those stereotypes of the
uptight Zen monk or the reclusive navel-gazer! You can find out everything
you ever wanted to know about meditation and enjoy yourself in the process.

Meditation For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Conventions Used in This Book
I use a few conventions in this book to help your reading go smoothly:
 When I want to make a topic crystal clear, I break the essential points
down into bulleted lists (like this one), so you can follow them easily
without getting lost in a sea of excess verbiage.
 Just as a piece of music may begin with a few opening phrases known as
a prelude, most meditation instructions in this book begin with a similar
directive — to sit quietly, close your eyes, and take a few deep breaths.
When you’re accustomed to this prelude, you can naturally begin with it
each time you meditate.
 The first time unfamiliar terms and phrases appear, they’re set in italics
and accompanied by a brief definition.
 Web addresses and e-mail addresses are set in monofont, so you can
easily spot them.
What You’re Not to Read
Here and there throughout this book I’ve sprinkled sidebars (text in gray
boxes), which offer extra information, such as stories, examples, explana-
tions, and assorted meditations. Though they’re fun to read and intended to
spice up the book, they’re not essential. So if you’re in a hurry to get to the
meat of the matter (or the yogurt, if you’re a vegetarian), feel free to skip over
them — and come back later if you’re so inclined.
Foolish Assumptions
When I wrote this book, I made a few assumptions about you, dear reader,
that I thought I should share with you before we begin:
 You’re intrigued enough by the topic of meditation to pick up this book,
but you haven’t yet discovered how to meditate — or if you have, you
still feel the need for more guidance.
 You want less stress and more happiness and peace of mind, and you’re
willing to devote a little of your precious time to achieve it.
3
Introduction

 Because you can’t afford to spend long hours meditating in a monastery
or ashram, you want instruction that you can put to use right now, at
home or at work.
 You don’t live on a desert island or in some isolated part of the globe;
instead, you inhabit the ordinary world and confront the usual stresses,
pressures, and responsibilities that most of us face.
If these assumptions apply to you, then you’re definitely in the right place!
How This Book Is Organized
Although I designed this book so you can read it cover to cover — some
people still do that, don’t they? — I also made sure that you can find what
you’re looking for easily and quickly. Each part covers a different phase of
your encounter with meditation.
Part I: Getting Acquainted
If you don’t know a thing about meditation, you’ll probably want to start
here. You’ll discover what meditation is (and isn’t), where it comes from, and
how you can use meditation to reduce your stress, improve your health, and
enhance your feelings of peace and well-being. This part also introduces you
to the devious workings of your own mind (in case you haven’t already
noticed) — and explains how meditation helps to keep you calm and focused.
Part II: Getting Started
Here’s where you actually find out how to sit down and work with your mind
(and heart)! Just in case you’re intimidated by the prospect of being quiet
and turning inward, I provide easy-to-follow instructions that lead you
through the process gently, step by step. I include a separate chapter on all
the little details that most meditation books take for granted — such as how
to keep your back (more or less) straight without getting uptight and what to
do with your eyes and hands — and a chapter on stretching and preparing
your body for sitting. You can even meditate lying down, if you prefer.
4
Meditation For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Part III: Troubleshooting and Fine-Tuning
After you start meditating regularly, you’ll find that questions and even prob-
lems arise from time to time. You may wonder how to put all the pieces
together in a way that’s uniquely suited to your needs. Or you may encounter
distractions you don’t know how to deal with, like recurring fantasies or diffi-
cult emotions (for example, “How can I possibly get my mind to stop playing
the same Beastie Boys tune over and over?”). This part covers the fine points
and hot spots of practice.
Part IV: Meditation in Action
It’s one thing to calm your mind and open your heart in the privacy of your
room, but quite another to practice meditation throughout your day, with
your boss (or your clients), your partner, your kids, and the person in the car
in front of you. This part shows you how to extend the benefits of meditation
to every area of your life, from sex to stress-reduction to spirituality. If you’re
primarily interested in healing your body or mind or performing more effec-
tively at work or play, you’ll find a chapter that shows you exactly what you
need to know. And if you’re fascinated by the wonders of spiritual unfolding,
you’ll find a chapter devoted to your interests as well.
Part V: The Part of Tens
I tend to gravitate to the end of a book first, which is why I love lists like
these. In this part, you find answers to the most frequently asked questions
about meditation, a distillation of the best all-purpose meditations, and com-
pelling scientific evidence of the healing power of meditation.
Part VI: Appendixes
If you’re not sure what to do next when you finish this book, you want to find
out more about a particular technique or approach to meditation, or you just
want to contact other people to meditate with, check out the annotated list of
meditation organizations, centers, and books in Appendix A. In Appendix B,
you’ll find instructions on how to use the CD as well as a list of all the tracks.

Introduction

Icons Used in This Book
Throughout this book, I use icons in the margins to draw your attention to
particular kinds of information. Here’s a key to what those icons mean:
For direct personal guidance in practicing the meditations marked by this
icon, just put down your book, cue up the CD, and follow my lead.
When you see this icon, prepare to stop what you’re doing, take a few deep
breaths, and start meditating. It’s your chance to savor the real thing!
If I haven’t said it before, I should have — it’s important information that bears
repeating.
This wise guy shows you where to look for musings of a more philosophical
nature.
If you want your meditations to be easier and more effective, follow this tidbit
of insider advice.
People have been meditating for thousands of years. Here’s some of the cool
stuff they’ve discovered, in the form of an anecdote or story.
Where To Go from Here
Now that you know the lay of the land (see the section “How This Book Is
Organized”), your next step is to decide where to go. Remember that you
don’t have to read the book sequentially, from cover to cover — you can pick
it up anywhere your interests lead you. I’ve written it intentionally with just
such an approach in mind.
If you’re drawn to a more theoretical discussion of the philosophical, histori-
cal, and scientific background of meditation, then by all means start with 
Part I, where I discuss meditation’s history, its health benefits, and the ways
in which your mind causes suffering and stress. But if you’re eager to get to
the nitty-gritty and can’t wait to sit down and start practicing, you may want
6
Meditation For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

to head directly for Part II, which provides everything you need to know to
meditate effectively.
After you’ve been practicing for a few weeks or months, you can return for a
refresher course and fine-tune your meditation by reading in Part III about
the various difficulties and obstacles that may arise — as well as about
strategies for developing and expanding your practice. And if you have par-
ticular areas of interest, such as spirituality, healing, or performance
enhancement, then you’ll find what you’re looking for in Part IV. Feel free to
browse and meander and read whatever strikes your fancy!

Part I
Getting
Acquainted

In this part . . .
You find out everything you could possibly want to
know about meditation to get you interested, moti-
vated, and, ultimately, started.
Did you realize that meditation has an illustrious multicul-
tural history? That regular practice offers dozens of scien-
tifically proven benefits, from reduced stress and lower
blood pressure and cholesterol levels to greater empathy
and enhanced creativity? Or that the real cause of suffer-
ing and stress is not what happens to you, but how your
mind responds? Well, read on!
You also have an opportunity to explore for yourself what
brings you to meditation — and what you hope to get out
of it.

Chapter 1
What Meditation Is — and Isn’t
In This Chapter
 Climbing the mountain of meditation
 Finding picnic spots and lesser peaks along the way
 Checking out the major meditation techniques
 Knowing what you’ll see when you get to the top
 Developing concentration, receptive awareness, contemplation, and cultivation
T
he great thing about meditation is that it’s actually quite simple. Just sit
down, be quiet, turn your attention inward, and focus your mind. That’s
all there is to it, really (see the sidebar “Meditation: It’s easier than you
think”). Then why, you may be wondering, do people write so many books
and articles about meditation — including detailed books like this one? Why
not just offer a few brief instructions and forget about all the verbiage?
Say that you’re planning to take a long trip by car to some picturesque loca-
tion. You could just jot down the directions and follow them one by one. After
a few days, you’d probably get where you want to go. But you’ll enjoy the trip
more if you have a travel guide to point out the sights along the way — and
you may feel more secure if you carry a troubleshooting manual to tell you
what to do when you have problems with your car. Perhaps you’d like to take
some side trips to scenic spots or even change your itinerary entirely and get
there by a different route — or a different vehicle!
In the same way, you can consider the practice of meditation to be a journey
of sorts — and the book you hold in your hands to be a travel guide. This
chapter provides an overview of your trip, offers some alternative routes to
your destination, explains the basic skills you need to know to get you there —
and points to some detours that may advertise the same benefits but that don’t
really deliver.

Embarking on the Journey of Meditation
No doubt you picked up this book because you’re searching for something
more in life — more peace of mind, more energy, more well-being, more
meaning, more happiness, more joy. You’ve heard about meditation, and you
wonder what it has to offer. To continue the journey metaphor, you could say
12
Part I: Getting Acquainted 
Meditation: It’s easier than you think
Meditation is simply the practice of focusing
your attention on a particular object — gener-
ally something simple, like a word or phrase, a
candle flame or geometrical figure, or the
coming and going of your breath. In everyday
life, your mind is constantly processing a bar-
rage of sensations, visual impressions, emo-
tions, and thoughts. When you meditate, you
narrow your focus, limit the stimuli bombarding
your nervous system — and calm your mind in
the process.
To get a quick taste of meditation, follow these
instructions. (For detailed audio instructions,
listen to Track 2 on the CD. Or, for more com-
plete meditation instructions, see Chapter 6.)
1. Find a quiet place and sit comfortably with
your back relatively straight.
If you tend to disappear into your favorite
chair, find something a bit more supportive.
2. Take a few deep breaths, close your eyes,
and relax your body as much as you can.
If you don’t know how to relax, you may
want to check out Chapter 6.
3. Choose a word or phrase that has special
personal or spiritual meaning for you.
Here are some examples: “There’s only love,”
“Don’t worry, be happy,” “Trust in God.”
4. Begin to breathe through your nose (if you
can), and as you breathe, repeat the word
or phrase quietly to yourself.
You can whisper the word or phrase, sub-
vocalize it (that is, move your tongue as
though saying it, but not aloud), or just
repeat it in your mind. If you get distracted,
come back to the repetition of the word or
phrase.
As an alternative, you can follow your
breath as it comes and goes through your
nostrils, returning to your breathing when
you get distracted.
5. Keep the meditation going for five minutes
or more; then slowly get up and go about
your day.
How did you feel? Did it seem weird to say the
same thing or follow your breath over and over?
Did you find it difficult to stay focused? Did you
keep changing the phrase? If so, don’t worry.
With regular practice and the guidance of this
book, you’ll gradually get the knack.
Of course, you could easily spend many fruitful
and enjoyable years mastering the subtleties
and complexities of meditation. But the good
news is, the basic practice is actually quite
simple, and you don’t have to be an expert to do
it — or to enjoy its extraordinary benefits.

that the practice of meditation begins where you are and ends up taking you
where you want to be.
Being an adventurous sort, I like to think of it as a climb up a mountain.
You’ve seen snapshots of the summit, and from the bottom you can barely
glimpse the summit through the clouds. But the only way to get there is up —
one step at a time.
Different paths up the same mountain
Imagine that you’re getting ready to climb this mountain. (If you live in the
Netherlands or the midwestern United States, get out your National
Geographic for this one!) How are you going to get to the top? You could take
some climbing lessons, buy the right gear, and inch your way up one of the
rocky faces. Or you could choose one of the many trails that meander up the
mountain and take a leisurely hike to the summit. (Of course, you could
always cheat and drive your car, but that would ruin my metaphor!)
Although they all end up at the same place, every trail has its unique charac-
teristics. One may take you on a gradual ascent through forests and mead-
ows, whereas another may head steeply uphill over dry, rocky terrain. From
one, you may have vistas of lush valleys filled with flowers; from another, you
may see farmland or desert.
Depending on your energy and your motivation, you may choose to stop at a
picnic spot en route and while away a few hours (or a few days) enjoying the
peace and quiet. Hey, you might enjoy it so much that you decide not to
climb any farther. Perhaps you’d rather climb one of the smaller peaks along
the way instead of going the distance to the top. Or you may prefer to charge
to the summit as quickly as you can without bothering to linger anywhere.
Well, the journey of meditation has a great deal in common with climbing a
mountain. You can aim for the top, or you can just set your sights on some
grassy knoll or lesser peak halfway up the slope. Whatever your destination,
you can have fun and reap the benefits of just breathing deeply and exercis-
ing muscles you didn’t even know you had.
People have been climbing the mountain of meditation for thousands of years
in different parts of the world. (For more on the history of meditation, see
Chapter 3.) As a result, topographic maps and guidebooks abound, each with
its own unique version of how to make your way up the mountain — and its
own recommendations for how to hike and what to carry. (To get a sense of the
range of meditation materials available these days, just check out the shelves
of your local bookstore or the Web pages of your favorite online book source.)
13
Chapter 1: What Meditation Is — and Isn’t

Traditionally, the guidebooks describe a spiritual path involving a set of
beliefs and practices, often secret, that have been passed down from one gen-
eration to the next (see the sidebar “Meditation’s spiritual roots”). In recent
decades, however, Western researchers and teachers have distilled medita-
tion from its spiritual origins and now offer it as a remedy for a variety of
21st-century ills. (For more on the benefits of meditation, see Chapter 2. For
more on meditation research, see Chapter 19.)
Although the maps and books may describe the summit differently — some
emphasize the vast open spaces, others pay more attention to the peace or
exhilaration you feel when you get there, and some even claim that there’s
more than one peak — I happen to agree with the ancient sage who said:
“Meditation techniques are just different paths up the same mountain.”
Here are a few of the many techniques that have been developed over the
centuries:
 Repetition of a meaningful word or phrase, known as a mantra (see
Chapters 3 and 13)
 Mindful awareness of the present moment (for more on mindfulness, see
Chapters 6 and 15)
 Following or counting your breath (see Chapter 6)
 Paying attention to the flow of sensations in your body (see Chapter 6)
 Cultivation of lovingkindness, compassion, forgiveness, and other heal-
ing emotions (see Chapter 10)
 Concentration on a geometric shape or other simple visual object
 Visualization of a peaceful place or a healing energy or entity (see
Chapter 16)
 Reading and reflecting upon inspirational or sacred writings (see
Chapter 13)
 Gazing at a picture of a holy being or saint
 Contemplation of nature
 Chanting praises to the Divine
Throughout this book, you find opportunities to experiment with many of these
techniques, as well as detailed guidance in the practice of one in particular —
mindfulness — beginning with your breath and then extending your medita-
tion to every moment of your life.

The view from the summit — and 
from other peaks along the way
When you reach the summit of the meditation mountain, what do you see? If
we can trust the reports of the meditators and mystics who have climbed the
mountain before us, we can declare with some confidence that the top of the
mountain harbors the source of all love, wisdom, happiness, and joy. Some
people call it spirit or soul, true nature or true self, the ultimate truth or the
ground of being (or just being itself). Others call it God or the Divine or the
Holy Mystery, or simply the One. There are nearly as many names for it as
people who experience it. And some spiritual traditions consider it so sacred
and powerful that they hesitate to give it a name.
As for the experience of reaching the summit, seasoned meditators use words
like enlightenment (from ignorance), awakening (from a dream), liberation
(from bondage), freedom (from limitation), and union (with God or being).
An old saying likens all these words and names to fingers pointing at the moon.
If you pay too much attention to the finger, you risk missing the beautiful
moon, which is the reason for pointing the finger in the first place. Ultimately,
you need to experience the moon — or in this case the summit — for yourself.
Of course, you may have no interest in lofty states and experiences like
enlightenment or union. Perhaps you bought this book simply because you
want to reduce your stress or enhance your healing process or deal with
your emotions. Forget about the Holy Mystery — a little more clarity and
peace of mind would suit you just fine, thank you very much!
Well, the truth is, you’re going to follow the same path no matter how high up
the mountain you want to go. The basic instructions remain the same — but
you get to choose your destination. Among the most popular stopping places
and promontories en route to the summit are the following:
 Stronger focus and concentration
 Reduced tension, anxiety, and stress
 Clearer thinking and less emotional turmoil
 Lower blood pressure and cholesterol
 Support in kicking addictions and other self-defeating behaviors
 Greater creativity and enhanced performance in work and play
 Increased self-understanding and self-acceptance
15
Chapter 1: What Meditation Is — and Isn’t

 More joy, love, and spontaneity
 Greater intimacy with friends and family members
 Deeper sense of meaning and purpose
 Glimpses of a spiritual dimension of being
As you can see, these way stations are actually major destinations in their
own right, and all of them are well worth reaching. (For more on the benefits
of meditation, see Chapter 2.) You may be quite content to stop halfway up
the mountain, after you’ve reduced your stress, improved your health, and
experienced greater overall well-being. Or you may feel inspired to push on
for the higher altitudes that the great meditators describe.
The taste of pure mountain water
To elaborate on this mountain metaphor a bit, imagine that there’s a spring at
the summit that gushes forth the pure water of being and never runs dry.
(Depending on your orientation, you may prefer to call it the water of grace or
spirit or unconditional love.) Those who make it to the top get to dive into the
pool that surrounds the spring and immerse themselves completely in the

Meditation’s spiritual roots
Although many ordinary folks are meditating
these days (including, quite possibly, people you
know), the practice wasn’t always so readily
available. For centuries, monks, nuns, mystics,
and wandering ascetics preserved it in secret,
using it to enter higher states of consciousness
and ultimately to achieve the pinnacle of their
particular paths.
Highly motivated laypeople with time on their
hands could always learn a few techniques. But
the rigorous practice of meditation remained a
sacred pursuit limited to an elite few who were
willing to renounce the world and devote their
lives to it. (See Chapter 3 for more on the history
of meditation.)
How times have changed! From Beat Zen in the
’50s and the influx of Indian yogis and swamis in
the ’60s to the current fascination with
Buddhism, meditation has definitely become
mainstream, and its practical benefits are
applauded in every medium, both actual and vir-
tual. (Have you ever checked out the Web sites
devoted to meditation?)
Meditation has been studied extensively in psy-
chology labs and reduced to formulas like the
Relaxation Response (a simple technique for
diminishing stress). Yet it has never entirely lost
its spiritual roots. In fact, the reason meditation
works so effectively is that it connects you with
a spiritual dimension, which different commen-
tators give different names, but I like to call
simply being.

water. In fact, some even merge with the water and become identical with
being itself. (Don’t worry, you won’t merge if you don’t want to!)
But you don’t have to climb all the way to the top to enjoy the pure taste of
being. The water flows down the mountain in streams and rivulets and nour-
ishes the fields and towns below. In other words, you can taste being every-
where, in everything, because being is the essence that keeps life going at
every level. Until you start meditating, though, you may not know what being
tastes like.
When you meditate, you get closer to the source of the water and learn how
to recognize its taste. (Depending on their personalities and where they are
on the mountain, people use different terms to describe the water’s taste,
such as calm, peace, well-being, wholeness, clarity, and compassion.) It doesn’t
matter where you’re headed or where you stop on your way up the mountain;
you still get to dip your hands in the water of being and taste it for yourself.
Then you can begin to find the taste of being wherever you go!

Chapter 1: What Meditation Is — and Isn’t
Discovering the treasure in your own house
In the Jewish tradition, they tell a story that has
its counterparts in all the world’s great medita-
tive teachings. Simon, a simple tailor, fantasizes
night and day about the great treasure he will
one day find when he leaves his little village and
his family home and ventures forth into the
world. Late one night, with a few belongings on
his back, he sets off on his travels.
For years, Simon wanders from one great city to
another, making his living mending clothes,
searching for the treasure he knows belongs to
him. But all the people he asks about the trea-
sure have problems of their own and are unable
to help him.
One day he comes upon a psychic known 
far and wide for her extraordinary abilities.
“Yes,” she says, “there is indeed a vast treasure
that belongs to you and you alone.” Hearing
this, Simon’s eyes light up with excitement. “I
will tell you how to find it,” she continues, giving
Simon complex directions that he meticulously
records.
When she comes to the end of her instructions
and describes the very street and house where
this treasure is allegedly buried, Simon can’t
believe his ears. For this is the very home he had
left years before when setting out on his quest.
Quickly he thanks the psychic, stuffs the direc-
tions in his pocket, and hurries back in the
direction from which he came. And lo and
behold, much to his surprise, he does indeed
find a vast and unfathomable treasure buried
beneath the hearth in his own house.
The point of this story is obvious: Though we
may wander in search of inner peace and
experiment with all kinds of meditative prac-
tices, the peace and love and wisdom we seek
are inevitably here all along, hidden within our
own hearts.

There’s no place like home — 
and you’re already there!
Now that I’ve constructed the metaphor of the mountain, I’m going to knock
it down with one sweep of my hand — like a wave washing away a castle in
the sand. Yes, the journey of meditation requires steady effort and applica-
tion like a climb up a mountain. (For more on effort and discipline, see
Chapter 9.) But that metaphor hides some important paradoxes:
 The summit doesn’t exist in some faraway place outside you; it exists
in the depths of your being — some traditions say in the heart — and
awaits your discovery. (See the sidebar “Discovering the treasure in
your own house,” in this chapter.)
 You can approach the summit in an instant; it doesn’t necessarily take
years of practice. While meditating, for example, when your mind settles
down and you experience a deep peace or tranquility, sense your inter-
connectedness with all beings, or feel an upsurge of peace or love,
you’re tasting the sweet water of being right from the source inside you.
And these moments inform and nourish you in ways you can’t possibly
measure.
 The mountain metaphor suggests a progressive, goal-oriented journey,
whereas, in fact, the point of meditation is to set aside all goals and
striving and just be. As the title of the bestseller by stress-reduction
expert Jon Kabat-Zinn puts it, “Wherever you go, there you are.” Or as
Dorothy says in The Wizard of Oz, “There’s no place like home” — and
the truth is, like Dorothy, you’re always already there!
Of course, you’re not going to give up all your doing and striving instanta-
neously and just be, even when you meditate. That’s something you work up
to slowly by practicing your meditation and gradually focusing and simplify-
ing until you’re doing less and less while you meditate — and being more and
more. The following are a few of the stages you may pass through on the path
to just being:
 Getting used to sitting still
 Developing the ability to turn your attention inward
 Struggling to focus your attention
 Being distracted again and again
 Becoming more focused
 Feeling more relaxed as you meditate
 Noticing fleeting moments when your mind settles down
 Experiencing brief glimpses of stillness and peace

And here’s perhaps the greatest paradox of all: If you practice meditation dili-
gently, you may eventually come to realize that you’ve never left home, even
for an instant.
Developing and Directing Awareness: 
The Key to Meditation
If, as the old saying goes, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single
step, then the journey of meditation begins with the cultivation of awareness,
or attention. In fact, awareness is the mental muscle that carries you along
and sustains you on your journey, not only at the start but every step of the
way. No matter which path or technique you choose, the secret of meditation
19
Chapter 1: What Meditation Is — and Isn’t
Becoming aware of your awareness
Most of the time, you probably don’t pay much
attention to your awareness. Yet the truth is, it’s
crucial to everything you do. When you watch
TV, study for an exam, cook a meal, drive your
car, listen to music, or talk with a friend, you’re
being aware, or paying attention. Before you
begin to meditate in a formal way, you may find
it helpful to explore your own awareness.
First, notice what it’s like to be aware. Are there
times in your life when you’re not aware of any-
thing? Now, complete this thought: “I am aware
of. . . .” Do this again and again and notice
where your awareness takes you.
Do you tend to be more aware of internal or
external sensations? Do you pay more atten-
tion to thoughts and fantasies than to your
moment-to-moment sensory experiences?
Notice whether a preoccupation with mental
activity diminishes your awareness of what’s
happening right here and now.
Next, pay attention to whether your awareness
tends to focus on a particular object or sensation
or tends to be more expansive and inclusive.
You may find that your awareness resembles a
spotlight that flows from object to object. Notice
how your awareness flows without trying to
change it.
Does it shift quickly from one thing to another,
or does it move more slowly, making contact
with each object before moving on? Experiment
with speeding up and slowing down the flow of
awareness, and notice how that feels.
You may discover that your awareness is drawn
again and again to certain kinds of objects and
events, but not to others. Where does your
awareness repeatedly wander? Which experi-
ence does it seem to selectively avoid?
Now, experiment with gently directing your
awareness from one focus to another. When
you pay attention to sounds, you may notice that
you momentarily forget about your hands or the
discomfort in your back or knees. Try to focus
on one object of attention for as long as you
can. How long can you remain undistracted
before your mind skips to the next thing?

lies in developing, focusing, and directing your awareness. (Incidentally,
attention is just slightly focused awareness, and I use the two terms more or
less interchangeably throughout this book. See the sidebar “Becoming aware
of your awareness.”)
To get a better sense of how awareness operates, consider another natural
metaphor: light. You may take light for granted, but unless you’ve developed
the special skills and heightened sensitivity of the blind, you can barely func-
tion without it. (Have you ever tried to find something in a pitch-dark room?)
The same is true for awareness: You may not be aware that you’re aware, but
you need awareness to perform even the simplest tasks.
You can use light in a number of ways. You can create ambient lighting that
illuminates a room softly and diffusely. You can focus light into a flashlight
beam to help you find things when the room is dark. Or you can take the very
same light and concentrate it into a laser beam so powerful that it can cut
through steel or send messages to the stars.
Likewise, in meditation, you can use awareness in different ways. To begin
with, you can increase your powers of awareness by developing concentra-
tion on a particular object. (For a brief list of meditation objects, see the sec-
tion “Different paths up the same mountain” earlier in this chapter.)
Then, when you’ve stabilized your concentration, you can, through the prac-
tice of receptive awareness, expand your awareness — like ambient light —
to illuminate the full range of your experience.
Next, you can concentrate even further in order to cultivate positive emo-
tions and mind-states. Or you can use awareness to investigate your inner
experience and contemplate the nature of existence itself.
These four — concentration, receptive awareness, cultivation, and
contemplation — constitute the major uses of awareness throughout the
world’s great meditative traditions.
Building concentration
To do just about anything well, you need to focus your awareness. The most
creative and productive people in every profession — for example, great ath-
letes, performers, businessmen, scientists, artists, and writers — have the
ability to block out distractions and completely immerse themselves in their
work. If you’ve ever watched Tiger Woods hit a drive or Nicole Kidman trans-
form herself into the character she’s portraying, you’ve witnessed the fruits
of total concentration.
20
Part I: Getting Acquainted 

Some people have an innate ability to concentrate, but most of us need to
practice to develop it. Buddhists like to compare the mind to a monkey —
constantly chattering and hopping about from branch to branch, topic to
topic. Did you ever notice that most of the time, you have scant control over
the whims and vacillations of your monkey mind, which may space out one
moment and obsess the next? When you meditate, you calm your monkey
mind by making it one-pointed rather than scattered and distracted.
Many spiritual traditions teach their students concentration as the primary
meditation practice. Just keep focusing your mind on the mantra or the
symbol or the visualization, they advise, and eventually you will attain what
is called absorption, or samadhi.
In absorption, the sense of being a separate “me” disappears, and only the
object of your attention remains. Followed to its natural conclusion, the prac-
tice of concentration can lead to an experience of union with the object of
your meditation. If you’re a sports enthusiast, this object could be your
tennis racket or your golf club; if you’re an aspiring mystic, the object could
be God or being or the absolute. (For more on the spiritual benefits of con-
centration, see Chapter 14. And if you want to use meditation to improve
your performance, check out Chapter 16.)
Even though you may not yet know how to meditate, you’ve no doubt had
moments of total absorption, when the sense of separation disappears:
gazing at a sunset, listening to music, creating a work of art, looking into the
eyes of your beloved. When you’re so completely involved in an activity,
whether work or play, that time stops and self-consciousness drops away,
you enter into what psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi calls flow. In fact,
Csikszentmihalyi claims that activities that promote flow epitomize what
most of us mean by enjoyment. Flow can be extraordinarily refreshing,
enlivening, and even deeply meaningful — and it is the inevitable result of
unbroken concentration.
Opening to receptive awareness
The great sages of China say that all things comprise the constant interplay
of yin and yang — the feminine and masculine forces of the universe. Well, if
concentration is the yang of meditation (focused, powerful, penetrating),
then receptive awareness is the yin (open, expansive, welcoming).
Where concentration disciplines, stabilizes, and grounds the mind, receptive
awareness loosens and extends the mind’s boundaries and creates more inte-
rior space, enabling you to familiarize yourself with the mind’s contents.
Where concentration blocks extra stimuli as distractions to the focus at
21
Chapter 1: What Meditation Is — and Isn’t

hand, receptive awareness embraces and assimilates every experience that
presents itself.
Most meditations involve the interplay of concentration and receptive aware-
ness, although some more-advanced techniques teach the practice of recep-
tive awareness alone. Just be open and aware and welcome to whatever
arises, they teach, and ultimately you will be “taken by truth.” Followed to its
conclusion, receptive awareness guides you in shifting your identity from
your thoughts, emotions, and the stories your mind tells you to your true
identity, which is being itself. (For more on thoughts, emotions, and stories,
see Chapter 5.)
Of course, if you don’t know how to work with attention, these instructions
are impossible to follow. That’s why most traditions prescribe practicing con-
centration first. Concentration, by quieting and grounding the mind (enough
so that it can open without being swept away by a deluge of irrelevant feel-
ings and thoughts), provides a solid foundation on which the practice of med-
itation can flourish.
Using contemplation for greater insight
Although concentration and receptive awareness provide enormous benefits,
ultimately it’s insight and understanding — of how the mind works, how you
perpetuate your own suffering, how attached you are to the outcome of
events, and how uncontrollable and fleeting these events are — that offer
freedom from suffering. And in your everyday life, it’s creative thinking —
free from the usual limited, repetitive patterns of thought — that offers solu-
tions to problems. That’s why contemplation is the third key component that
transforms meditation from a calming, relaxing exercise to a vehicle for free-
dom and creative expression.
After you’ve developed your concentration and expanded your awareness,
you eventually find that you have access to a more penetrating insight into
the nature of your experience. You can use this faculty to explore your inner
terrain and gradually understand and undermine your mind’s tendency to
cause you suffering and stress (see Chapters 5 and 11). If you’re a spiritual
seeker, you can use this faculty to inquire into the nature of the self or to
reflect upon the mystery of God and creation. And if you’re a person with
more practical concerns, you may ponder the next step in your career or
relationship or contemplate some seemingly irresolvable problem in your
life. (For more on the uses of meditation in ordinary life situations, check out
Chapter 15.)
22

Cultivating positive, healing 
states of mind
Some meditations aim to open the heart and develop certain life-affirming
qualities like compassion, lovingkindness, equanimity, joy, or forgiveness
(see Chapter 10). On a more practical level, you can use meditation to culti-
vate a proactive, healthy immune system or to develop poise and precision in
a particular sport. For example, you can visualize killer T cells attacking your
cancer or imagine yourself executing a dive without a single mistake (see
Chapter 16). These are the kinds of meditations I’ve chosen to call cultivation.
Where contemplation aims to investigate, inquire, and ultimately see deeply
into the nature of things, cultivation can help you transform your inner life by
directing the concentration you develop to strengthen positive, healthy mind-
states and withdraw energy from those that are more reactive and self-defeating.
Making Meditation Your Own
Developing and directing your awareness may be the foundation of effective
meditation — but like any good foundation, it’s only the beginning. The next
step is to build your house brick by brick, meditation session by meditation
session, discovering  what works for you and what doesn’t, until your prac-
tice is grounded and stable. Or, to harken back to the journey metaphor,
awareness is the muscle that propels you up the mountain. But you need to
choose your route, find your pace, and navigate the obstacles that get in your
way. In other words, you need to fashion and maintain your own practice and
troubleshoot the difficulties that arise.
Designing your own practice
When you begin to develop and direct your awareness in meditation, you’re
faced with the challenge of putting all the pieces together into an integrated
practice that’s uniquely suited to your needs. (For more on designing your
own practice, see Chapter 13.) For example, you may find yourself drawn to
forms of meditation that emphasize focused concentration and have only
minimal interest in the more open, allowing quality of receptive awareness.
Or you may cherish the peace and relaxation you experience when you
simply sit quietly without any effort or focus, not even the effort to be aware.
Or you may have a specific purpose for meditating, such as healing an illness
23
Chapter 1: What Meditation Is — and Isn’t

or resolving a disturbing psychological issue, and only feel drawn to
approaches that help you meet your goals.
The key is to experiment with different forms of meditation and trust your intu-
ition to tell you which ones are best suited for you at this particular point on
your journey up the mountain. Inevitably, yin and yang tend to balance each
other out; that is, you may start out with intense concentration and end up
with more relaxed, receptive awareness — or begin in a more receptive mode
and gradually discover the virtues of focus. The journey of meditation has its
own lessons to teach, and no matter what your intentions may be, you’ll gener-
ally end up encountering those lessons that you were destined to learn.
Of course, if you intend to maintain your practice from week to week and
month to month, which is the only way to reap the benefits of meditation,
you’ll probably need to draw on some of those time-honored qualities that
every sustained enterprise requires: motivation, discipline, and commitment
(see Chapters 4 and 9). Though they’ve gotten a bad rap in Western culture,
where people generally expect to have their needs met right now, if not
sooner, these qualities are actually not difficult to cultivate and in fact arise
naturally when you’re engaged in and — dare I say it — passionate about
what you’re doing.
Troubleshooting the challenges
As your meditation practice deepens and evolves, you may find yourself
encountering unexpected challenges that you don’t quite know how to handle.
Here again, the mountain metaphor comes in handy. Say you’re halfway up the
trail and you hit a patch of icy terrain, or boulders block your path, or a thun-
derstorm sends you scurrying for cover. What do you do now? Do you pull out
your special equipment and consult preestablished guidelines for dealing with
the difficulties? Or do you just have to improvise as best you can?
The good news, as I mention earlier in this chapter, is that people have been
climbing this mountain for thousands of years, and they’ve crafted tools and
fashioned maps for traversing the terrain as smoothly and painlessly as pos-
sible. For example, if powerful emotions like anger, fear, sadness, or grief
sweep through your meditation and make it difficult for you to stay present,
you can draw on techniques for loosening their grip. (For guidelines on medi-
tating with challenging emotions and habitual patterns, see Chapter 11.) Or if
you encounter some of the common obstacles and roadside distractions on
the path of meditation, such as sleepiness, restlessness, rapture, or doubt,
you can count on time-honored methods for moving beyond them so you can
continue on your way.

Other Journeys That Masquerade 
as Meditation
Now that you have an overview of the meditative journey, take a look at some
paths that superficially resemble meditation but lead you in an altogether dif-
ferent direction.
Of course, every activity can become a meditation if you do it with awareness
or concentration. For example, you can wash the dishes or drive the car or
talk on the phone meditatively. (For more on how to do this, see Chapter 15.)

Chapter 1: What Meditation Is — and Isn’t
Mindfulness: Meditation as a way of life
Although I provide a variety of different tech-
niques for your enjoyment and exploration, this
book offers as its primary approach what the
Buddhists call mindfulness — ongoing attention
to whatever arises moment to moment.
Based on my years of experience and training,
I’ve found that mindfulness, which blends con-
centration and receptive awareness, is one of
the simplest techniques for beginners to learn
and also one of the most readily adaptable to
the busy schedules most of us face. After all, if
you’re like me, you’re primarily concerned with
living a more harmonious, loving, stress-free
life, not lifting off into some disembodied spiri-
tual realm divorced from the people and places
you love.
In fact, the beauty, belonging, and love you seek
are available right here and now — you only
need to clear your mind and open your eyes,
which is precisely what the practice of mindful-
ness is intended to teach! When you pay atten-
tion to your experience from moment to
moment, you keep waking up from the day-
dreams and worries your mind fabricates and
returning to the clarity, precision, and simplicity
of the present, where life actually takes place.
The great thing about mindfulness is that you
don’t have to limit your practice to certain
places and times — you can practice waking up
and paying attention wherever you happen to
be, at any time of the day or night.

But certain activities become confused with meditation in the popular imagi-
nation, whereas they may have a totally different intent. Some people claim
that reading the newspaper or watching their favorite sitcom qualifies as
meditation — well, who am I to judge?
Here are some ersatz meditations that certainly have their place in the reper-
tory of leisure pursuits but don’t generally offer the benefits of meditation:
 Thinking: In the West, the term meditation has frequently been used to
refer to a kind of focused reflection on a particular theme, as when you
say, “I’m going to meditate on this problem for a while.” Although higher-
order contemplation or inquiry plays a part in some meditation tech-
niques, it bears little resemblance to the often tortured, conflicted
process that usually passes for thinking. Besides, thinking tires you out,
whereas meditation refreshes you and perks you up.
 Daydreaming: Daydreaming and fantasy offer their own unique plea-
sures and rewards, including occasional problem-solving and a momen-
tary escape from difficult or tedious circumstances. But rather than
leaving you feeling more spacious and more connected with being, as
meditation does, daydreaming often embroils you more actively in the
drama of your life.
 Spacing out: Sometimes spacing out involves a momentary gap in the
unbroken stream of thoughts and feelings that flood your awareness, a
kind of empty space in which nothing seems to be happening except
being itself. Such genuine “spacing out” lies at the heart of meditation
and can be deliberately cultivated and extended. Alas, most spacing out
is just another form of daydreaming!
 Repeating affirmations: This common new-age practice — a contempo-
rary version of what used to be called positive thinking — purports to
provide an antidote to your negative beliefs by replacing them with posi-
tive alternatives. Generally, however, the negativity is so deeply rooted
that the affirmations merely skim the surface like froth on the ocean and
never really penetrate to the depths, where your core beliefs reside.
 Self-hypnosis: By progressively relaxing your body and imagining a safe,
protected place, you can lull yourself into an open, suggestible state
known as a light trance. Here you can rehearse upcoming performances,
rerun past events to get a more positive outcome, and reprogram your
brain using affirmations. Although self-hypnosis differs from mindfulness
meditation — the primary approach taught in this book, emphasizing
ongoing attention to the present moment — it’s actually quite similar to
the healing and performance enhancement techniques offered in
Chapter 16.
26

 Praying: Ordinary or petitionary prayer, which calls on God for help or
asks for something, can be performed meditatively but has little in
common with meditation as I’ve been describing it. However, contempla-
tive prayer, also known as orison (the yearning of the soul for union with
the Divine) is actually a form of concentrated contemplation whose
focus is God.
 Sleeping: Refreshing though it may be, sleep is not meditation — unless
you happen to be an expert yogi who meditates in your sleep. Research
shows that the brain waves generated during sleep are significantly dif-
ferent from those generated during meditation. Of course, meditators
often find themselves falling asleep — and then, as one of my teachers
used to say, sleep well! (For more on sleepiness in meditation, see
Chapter 12.)

Eating a piece of fruit
For this in-the-moment exercise, imagine that
you’ve just arrived from another planet and
have never experienced an orange before.
1. Place an orange on a plate and close your
eyes.
2. Set aside all thoughts and preconceptions,
open your eyes, and see the fruit as though
for the first time.
Notice the shape, the size, the color, the
texture.
3. As you begin to peel the orange, notice
how it feels in your fingers, the contrast
between the flesh and the peel, the weight
of the fruit in your hand.
4. Slowly raise a piece of the orange to your
lips and pause a moment before eating.
Notice how it smells before you begin.
5. Open your mouth, bite down, and feel the
texture of its soft flesh and the first rush of
juice into your mouth.
6. Continue to bite and chew the orange,
remaining aware of the play of sensations
from moment to moment.
Imagining that this may be the first and last
orange you will ever eat, let each moment
be fresh and new and complete in itself.
Notice how this experience of eating an
orange differs from your usual way of eating
a piece of fruit.

lems that meditation can help resolve. You know the old expression “If it ain’t
broke, don’t fix it”? Well, the reality is that many of us find that our lives are
“broke” in some pretty significant ways. After all, you bought this book for a
reason or two. Now it’s time to find out what some of those reasons may be.
How Life Drives You — to Meditate
Although you may be reluctant to admit it, at least publicly, life doesn’t always
live up to your expectations. As a result, you suffer — from stress, disappoint-
ment, fear, anger, outrage, hurt, or any of a number of other unpleasant emo-
tions. Meditation teaches you how to relate to difficult circumstances and the
tensions and emotions they evoke with balance, equanimity, and compassion.
But before I describe the positive solutions that meditation has to offer —
and rest assured, there are plenty — I’d like to take you on a whirlwind tour
of the problems they’re intended to solve.

The myth of the perfect life
In my years as a psychotherapist and meditation teacher, I’ve noticed that
many people suffer because they compare their lives to some idealized image
of how life is supposed to be. Cobbled together from childhood conditioning,
media messages, and personal desires, this image lurks in the shadows and
becomes the standard to which every success or failure, every circumstance
or turn of events, is compared and judged. Take a moment to check out yours.
Perhaps you’ve spent your life struggling to build the American dream — two
kids, house in the suburbs, brilliant career, what Zorba the Greek called the
“full catastrophe.” After all, that’s what your parents had (or didn’t have),
and you decided that you owed it to them and to yourself to succeed. Only
now you’re juggling two jobs to save the money for a down payment, the mar-
riage is falling apart, and you feel guilty because you don’t have enough time
to spend with the kids.
Or maybe you believe that ultimate happiness would come your way if you
could only achieve the perfect figure (or physique). The problem is, diets
don’t work, you can’t make yourself adhere to exercise regimens, and every
time you look in the mirror, you feel like passing out. Or perhaps your idea of
earthly nirvana is the perfect relationship. Unfortunately, you’re approaching
40, you still haven’t met Mr. or Ms. Right, and you scour the personals while
secretly fearing that you must have some horrible social disease.
Whatever your version of the perfect life — perfect vacations, perfect sex,
perfect health, even perfect peace of mind or total freedom from all tension
and stress — you pay a high price for holding such high expectations. When
life fails to live up to those expectations, as it inevitably does, you end up suf-
fering and blaming yourself. (Take it from me — I’ve fallen into this trap
myself again and again!) If only you had made more money, spent more time
at home, been a better lover, gone back to school, lost those extra pounds . . .
the list is endless. No matter how you slice it, you just don’t measure up.
Or perhaps you’re among the elite few who manage to get everything you
want. The problem is, you eventually find yourself becoming bored and want-
ing more — or you spend every spare moment struggling to protect or con-
trol what you have.
The great meditative traditions have a more humane message to impart.
They teach that the ideal earthly life is a myth. As an old Christian saying
puts it, “Man proposes, God disposes.” Or, in the words of a popular joke, “If
you want to make God laugh, tell her your plans.” These traditions remind us
that far more powerful forces are at work in the universe than you and I. You
can envision and intend and strive and attempt to control all you want — and
ultimately even achieve some modicum of success. But the truth is, in the long
run, you and I have only the most limited control over the circumstances of
our lives. (For more on letting go, see Chapter 9.)

When things keep falling apart
Because it runs counter to everything you’ve ever been taught, you may have
a difficult time accepting the basic spiritual truth that you and I have only
limited control over the events in our lives. After all, isn’t the point of life to
go out and “just do it,” as the Nike ads urge? Well, yes, you need to follow
your dreams and live your truth; that’s a crucial part of the equation.
But when life turns around and slaps you in the face, as it sometimes does,
how do you respond? (Look at the Olympic skiers who spend years in train-
ing only to have their hopes for a medal wiped out in an instant by bad
weather or a patch of ice!) Or when it levels you completely and deprives you
of everything you’ve gained, including your confidence and your hard-won
self-esteem, where do you go for succor and support? How do you deal with
the pain and confusion? What inner resources do you draw upon to guide you
through this frightening and unknown terrain? Consider the following story.
One day a woman came to see the Buddha (the great spiritual teacher who
lived several thousand years ago in India) with her dead child in her arms.
Grief-stricken, she had wandered from place to place, asking people for medi-
cine to restore him to life. As a last resort, she asked the Buddha if he could
help her. “Yes,” he said, “but you must first bring me some mustard seed from
a house in which there has never been a death.”
Filled with hope, the woman went from door to door inquiring, but no one
could help her. Every house she entered had witnessed its share of deaths.
By the time she reached the end of the village, she had awakened to the real-
ization that sickness and death are inevitable. After burying her son, she
returned to the Buddha for spiritual instruction. “Only one law in the uni-
verse never changes,” he explained, “that all things change and all things are
impermanent.” Hearing this, the woman became a disciple and eventually, it
is said, attained enlightenment.
Of course, life offers far more than sickness and death; it also presents us
with moments of extraordinary love, beauty, wonder, and joy. But like the
woman in the story, we in the West — and the United States especially —
tend to deny the dark side of life. We relegate our old and dying to nursing
homes, ignore our homeless, restrict our impoverished minorities to ghet-
toes, and confine our mentally ill and developmentally challenged to hospi-
tals and asylums, while plastering our billboards and magazines with the
smiling faces of youth and prosperity.
The fact is, life is a rich and perplexing interplay of light and dark, success
and failure, youth and age, pleasure and pain — and, yes, life and death.
Circumstances change constantly, apparently falling apart one moment, only
to come together the next. As the contemporary Zen teacher Shunryu Suzuki
puts it, everything is constantly “losing its balance against a background of
perfect balance.”
31
Chapter 2: Why Meditate?

The key to your peace of mind lies not in your circumstances, but in how you
respond to them. As the Buddhists say, suffering is wanting what you don’t
have and not wanting what you do have, while happiness is precisely the
opposite: enjoying what you have and not hungering for what you don’t have.
This concept doesn’t mean that you must give up your values, dreams, and
aspirations — only that you need to balance them with the ability to accept
things as they are.
Meditation gives you an opportunity to cultivate acceptance by teaching you
to reserve judgment and to open to each experience without trying to change
or get rid of it. Then, when the going gets rough, you can make use of this
quality to ease your ruffled feathers and maintain your peace of mind. (If you
want to find out how to accept things the way they are, turn to Chapters 6
and 11.)
Dealing with the postmodern predicament
Of course, it’s news to no one that circumstances change constantly — certainly
pundits and sages have purveyed this truth for ages. But at no time in his-
tory has change been as pervasive and relentless — or affected our lives so
deeply — as during the past 10 or 15 years. Watching the evening news or
reading a paper, we’re flooded with statistics and images of violence, famine,
and disease; environmental depredation; and economic instability; all depict-
ing a world that seems to be coming increasingly unstitched.
On a more personal level, you may have lost your job because of corporate
downsizing, ended a relationship because your lover was shipped off to
another state, been a victim of a violent crime, or lost a bundle in a volatile
market. Perhaps you spend your spare time figuring out how to stay one step
ahead in a competitive work environment. Or you may simply lie awake each

Appreciating impermanence
In his book Thoughts without a Thinker, psychi-
atrist Mark Epstein recounts this teaching by
the Thai meditation master Achaan Chaa. “You
see this goblet?” Achaan Chaa asks. “For me
this glass is already broken. I enjoy it; I drink out
of it. It holds my water admirably, sometimes
even reflecting the sun in beautiful patterns. 
If I should tap it, it has a lovely ring to it. But
when I put this glass on the shelf and the wind
knocks it over or my elbow brushes it off the
table and it falls to the ground and shatters, I
say, ‘Of course.’ When I understand that this
glass is already broken, every moment with it is
precious.”

night worrying about when the tidal wave of change will finally reach you and
sweep you away. Does any of this sound familiar?
Sociologists call this period the postmodern era, when constant change is
becoming a way of life and time-honored values and truths are being rapidly
dismantled. How do you navigate your way through life when you no longer
know what’s true and you’re not even sure how to find out? Do you search for
it on the Web or somehow glean it from the latest pronouncements of media
soothsayers and corporate CEOs?
Despite the unarguable advantages of all the electronic gadgets that have
become indispensable since the 1980s, you may have noticed that the faster
you communicate, the less you really connect with others in a rich and mean-
ingful way. A cartoon reprinted in Newsweek sums it up well: Entitled “A ’90s
Vacation,” it shows a family on a beach, each person using his or her own
personal electronic device: Mom’s on the phone, Dad’s on the Internet, one
child is picking up a fax, another is responding to his beeper, a third is check-
ing her voicemail — and they’re all oblivious to one another!
Such relentless change exacts a steep emotional and spiritual price, which we
tend to deny in our collective attempt to accentuate the positive and deny
the negative. Here are a few of the negative side effects of life in the postmod-
ern age:
 Anxiety and stress: When the ground starts shifting beneath your feet,
your first reaction as you attempt to regain your stability may be anxiety
or fear. This gut-level response has been programmed into our genes by
millions of years of living on the edge. These days, unfortunately, the
tremors never stop, and small fears accumulate and congeal into ongo-
ing tension and stress. Your body may feel perpetually braced against
the next onslaught of difficulties and responsibilities — which makes it
virtually impossible to relax and enjoy life fully. By relaxing your body
and reducing stress, meditation can provide a much-needed antidote.
 Fragmentation: Most Americans once lived, shopped, worked, raised
their kids, and spent their leisure time in the same community. They
encountered the same faces every day, worked the same job for a life-
time, stayed married to the same person, and watched their children
raise their own children just down the block. Now we often shuttle our
kids off to school or daycare and commute long distances to work, while
checking our messages on the cellphone. On the way home, we may
stop by the mall, and we may spend our evenings surfing the Net. We
change jobs and partners more frequently than ever, and when our chil-
dren grow up, they often move to another state — or another country!
Although we may not be able to stay the tide of fragmentation, we can
use meditation to connect us with a deeper wholeness that external cir-
cumstances can’t disturb.
33
Chapter 2: Why Meditate?

 Alienation: When our lives appear to be made up of disconnected
puzzle pieces that don’t fit together, no wonder we wind up feeling com-
pletely stressed out. Despite the statistics that herald prosperous times,
many people work at marginal jobs that pay the bills but fail to connect
them to a deeper sense of value or purpose. According to an article in
American Demographics magazine, more people are flocking to small
towns in an attempt to recapture a sense of community, and fewer and
fewer are voting in each election, apparently because they believe that
they have little power to change things. Never before, it seems, have
human beings felt so alienated, not only from their work and their gov-
ernment, but also from others, themselves, and their own essential
being — and most of us don’t have the skills or the know-how to recon-
nect! By bridging the chasm that separates us from ourselves, medita-
tion can help to heal our alienation from others and the world at large.
 Loneliness and isolation: With people moving from place to place more
frequently and families fragmenting and scattering across the globe,
you’re less and less likely to have regular contact with the people you
know and love — and even if you do, you may be too busy to relate in a
mutually fulfilling way. Recently, I heard a radio ad arguing that since
family dinners are clearly a thing of the past, why not purchase Family
Net — a separate cellphone for mom, dad, and the kids — so that the
family can keep in touch! Again, you may not be able to stem the forces
that keep us apart. But you can use meditation to turn every moment
together into “quality time.”
 Depression: When people feel lonely, alienated, stressed out, and dis-
connected from a deeper source of meaning and purpose, it’s no wonder
that some end up feeling depressed. In a nation where Prozac is a house-
hold word, millions of people take mood-altering chemicals each day to
keep from feeling the pain of postmodern life. Meditation can connect
you with your own inner source of contentment and joy that naturally
dispels the clouds of depression.
 Stress-related illness: From tension headaches and acid indigestion to
heart disease and cancer, the steady rise in stress-related illness reflects
our collective inability to cope with the instability and fragmentation of
our times — and fuels a billion-dollar healthcare industry that at times
only masks the deeper problems of fear, stress, and disorientation. As
numerous scientific studies have shown, the regular practice of medita-
tion can actually reverse the onslaught of many stress-related ailments.

Four popular “solutions” 
that don’t really work
Before I leave the litany of postmodern woes and suggest some solutions that
actually work, I’d like to offer a quick look at a few popular approaches to
handling stress and uncertainty that create more problems than they solve:
 Addiction: By distracting people from their pain, encouraging them to
set aside their usual concerns and preoccupations, and altering brain
chemistry, addictions mimic some of the benefits of meditation. Unfortu-
nately, addictions also tend to fixate the mind on an addictive substance
or activity — drugs, alcohol, sex, gambling, and so on — making it even
more difficult for people to be open to the wonders of the moment or to
connect with a deeper dimension of being. Besides, most addictions
involve a self-destructive lifestyle that ultimately intensifies the prob-
lems the addict was attempting to escape.
 Fundamentalism: By advocating simple, one-dimensional answers to com-
plex problems, offering a sense of meaning and belonging, and repudiat-
ing many of the apparent evils of postmodern life, fundamentalism — be
it religious or political — provides a refuge from ambiguity and alienation.
35
Chapter 2: Why Meditate?
Accepting things the way they are
In the Zen tradition, they tell the story of a poor
farmer who lost his only horse. His friends and
neighbors bemoaned his plight, but he seemed
unperturbed. “We’ll see,” he said with an enig-
matic smile.
Several days later, his horse returned with a
pack of five wild stallions that had joined it along
the way. His neighbors rejoiced in his good for-
tune, but he did not appear to be excited. “We’ll
see,” he said again.
The following week, while attempting to ride
and tame one of the stallions, his beloved, only
son fell and broke his leg. The ever-solicitous
neighbors were beside themselves with grief,
but the farmer, though he comforted and cared
for the boy, did not seem to be concerned about
the future. “We’ll see,” he mused.
At the end of the month, the local warlord
arrived in the farmer’s village to conscript all the
healthy young men to fight in the latest cam-
paign. But the farmer’s son . . . well, you can
imagine the rest of the story.
In case you hadn’t noticed, life’s a roller-coaster
ride, and you can’t control the ups and downs. If
you want to hold on to your lunch — and your
sanity — you need to learn how to maintain
your peace of mind.

Alas, fundamentalists divide the world into black and white, good and
bad, us and them, which only fuels the fires of alienation, conflict, and
stress in the world at large.
 Entertainment: When you feel lonely or alienated, just turn on the tube
or head to your local multiplex and take in the latest offering. That will
calm your anxiety or soothe your pain — or will it? In addition to provid-
ing entertainment, the media seemingly create community by connect-
ing us with other people and the events around us. But you can’t have a
heart-to-heart conversation with a TV celebrity or hug your favorite
movie star. Besides, the media (intentionally or not) manipulate your
emotions, fill your mind with the ideas and images of the popular cul-
ture, and focus your attention outside yourself — rather than give you
the opportunity to find out what you really think, feel, and know.
 Consumerism: This bogus solution to life’s ills teaches that wanting 
and having more is the answer — more food, more possessions, more
vacations, more of every perk that plastic can buy. As you may have
noticed, however, the thrill fades fast, and you’re quickly planning your
next purchase — or struggling to figure out how to pay the credit-card
bill that arrives like clockwork at the end of the month. Need I say more?
How to Survive the 21st Century — 
with Meditation
Now for the good news! As I mention earlier in this chapter, meditation offers
a time-honored antidote to fragmentation, alienation, isolation, stress — even
stress-related illnesses and depression. Although it won’t solve the external
problems of your life, it does help you develop inner resilience, balance, and
strength to roll with the punches and come up with creative solutions.
To get a sense of how meditation works, imagine for a moment that your
body and mind are a complex computer. Instead of being programmed to
experience inner peace, harmony, equanimity, and joy, you’ve been pro-
grammed to respond to life’s inevitable ups and downs with stress, anxiety,
and dissatisfaction. But you have the power to change your programming. By
putting aside all other activities, sitting quietly, and attuning yourself to the
present moment for 10 or 15 minutes each day, you’re developing a whole
new set of habitual responses and programming yourself to experience more
positive emotions and mind-states. (For more on the actual practice of medi-
tation, see Chapters 6 and 10.)
Of course, if you find it distasteful to think of yourself as a computer, you can
picture life as an ocean, with the constant ups and downs you experience as
the waves that churn and roil on the water’s surface. When you meditate, you
dive beneath the surface to a quiet place where the water is calmer and more
consistent.

Part I: Getting Acquainted 

Whatever your favorite metaphor, the point is that meditation provides a way
of transforming stress and suffering into equanimity and ease. In this section,
you get to see how meditators have been reaping the remarkable benefits of
meditation for millennia — and how you can, too!
Advanced technology for 
the mind and heart
Traditionally, the Western world has emphasized external achievement, and
the East has valued inner development. The great scientific and technological
advances of the past 500 years originated in the West, while yogis and roshis
in the monasteries and ashrams of Asia were cultivating the inner arts of
meditation. (See Chapter 3 for more about the history of meditation.) Now
the currents of East and West and North and South have joined and are inter-
mingling to form an emerging global culture and economy. As a result, we can
apply the inner “technology” perfected in the East to balance the excesses of
the rapid technological innovations perfected in the West!
Like master computer programmers, the great meditation masters through-
out history developed the capacity to program their bodies, minds, and
hearts to experience highly refined states of being. While we in the West were
charting the heavens and initiating the Industrial Revolution, they were chalk-
ing up some pretty remarkable accomplishments of their own:
 Penetrating insights into the nature of the mind and the process by
which it creates and perpetuates suffering and stress
 Deep states of ecstatic absorption in which the meditator is completely
immersed in union with the Divine
 The wisdom to discriminate between relative reality and the sacred
dimension of being
 Unshakable inner peace that external circumstances can’t disturb
 The cultivation of positive, beneficial, life-affirming mind-states, such as
patience, love, kindness, equanimity, joy, and — especially — compassion
for the suffering of others
 The ability to control bodily functions that are usually considered invol-
untary, such as heart rate, body temperature, and metabolism
 The capacity to mobilize and move vital energy through the different
centers and channels of the body for the sake of healing and personal
transformation
 Special psychic powers, such as clairvoyance (the ability to perceive
matters beyond the range of ordinary perception) and telekinesis (the
ability to move objects at a distance without touching them)
37
Chapter 2: Why Meditate?

Of course, the great meditators of the past used these qualities to seek libera-
tion from suffering, either by withdrawing from the world into a more exalted
reality or by achieving penetrating insights into the nature of existence. Yet
the meditation technology they developed — which has become widely avail-
able in the West in the past few decades — can be used by the rest of us in
ordinary, everyday ways to yield some extraordinary benefits.
The mind-body benefits of meditation
Although the earliest scientific studies of meditation date back to the 1930s
and 1940s, research into the psychophysiological effects of meditation took
off in the 1970s, fueled by a burgeoning interest in Transcendental Meditation
(TM), Zen, and other Eastern meditation techniques. (For some of the most
influential research studies, see Chapter 19.) Since then, more than 1,000 stud-
ies have been published in English. In the book The Physical and Psychological
Effects of Meditation (first published in 1988 and revised and updated in 1997),
Michael Murphy and coauthor Steven Donovan sifted through these studies
and synthesized the data.
Murphy, author of the best-seller Golf in the Kingdom, has pioneered the
exploration of human potential since he co-founded Esalen Institute in Big
Sur, California, in 1962. (Esalen is generally acknowledged as the birthplace of
the human potential movement.) Donovan, former president and CEO of
Esalen, directed the Institute’s Study of Exceptional Functioning. Based on
the results of the studies they surveyed, Murphy and Donovan came up with
the following mind-body benefits of meditation.
Physiological benefits:
 Decreased heart rate during quiet meditation
 Lower blood pressure in normal and moderately hypertensive individuals
 Quicker recovery from stress
 Increase in alpha rhythms (slow, high-amplitude brain waves that corre-
late with relaxation)
 Enhanced synchronization (that is, simultaneous operation) of the right and
left hemispheres of the brain (which positively correlates with creativity)
 Reduced cholesterol levels
 Decreased consumption of energy and need for oxygen
 Deeper, slower breathing
 Muscle relaxation
 Reduction in the intensity of pain

Psychological benefits:
 More happiness and peace of mind
 Less emotional reactivity; fewer intense negative emotions and dramatic
mood swings
 Increased empathy

Chapter 2: Why Meditate?
Tuning in to your body
Like Mr. Duffy in James Joyce’s novel Ulysses,
most of us “live a short distance” from our
bodies. The following meditation, which has
counterparts in yoga and Buddhism, helps
reestablish contact with the body by drawing
attention gently from one part to another.
Because it cultivates awareness and also
relaxes the muscles and internal organs, it
makes a great preamble to more formal medita-
tion practice. Allow at least 20 minutes to com-
plete. (For complete audio instructions, listen to
Track 3 on the CD.)
1. Lie on your back on a comfortable surface —
but not too comfortable unless you plan to fall
asleep.
2. Take a few moments to feel your body as a
whole, including the places where it con-
tacts the surface of the bed or floor.
3. Bring your attention to your toes.
Allow yourself to feel any and all sensations
in this area. If you don’t feel anything, just
feel “not feeling anything.” As you breathe,
imagine that you’re breathing into and out
of your toes. (If this feels weird or uncom-
fortable, just breathe in your usual way.)
4. When you’re done with your toes, move on
to your soles, heels, the tops of your feet,
and your ankles in turn, feeling each part
in the same way that you felt your toes.
Take your time. The point of this exercise is
not to achieve anything, not even relaxation,
but to be as fully present as possible wher-
ever you are.
5. Gradually move up your body, staying at
least three or four breaths with each part.
Follow this approximate order: lower legs,
knees, thighs, hips, pelvis, lower abdomen,
lower back, solar plexus, upper back, chest,
shoulders. Now focus on the fingers, hands,
and arms on both sides, and then on the
neck and throat, chin, jaws, face, back of
the head, and top of the head.
By the time you reach the top of your head,
you may feel as though the boundaries
between you and the rest of the world have
become more fluid — or have melted away
entirely. At the same time, you may feel
silent and still — free of your usual rest-
lessness or agitation.
6. Rest there for a few moments; then gradu-
ally bring your attention back to your body
as a whole.
7. Wiggle your toes, move your fingers, open
your eyes, rock from side to side, and
gently sit up.
8. Take a few moments to stretch and reac-
quaint yourself with the world around you
before standing up and going about your day.

 Enhanced creativity and self-actualization
 Heightened perceptual clarity and sensitivity
 Reductions in both acute and chronic anxiety
 Complement to psychotherapy and other approaches in the treatment
of addiction

Promoting the benefits of meditation
Although Western researchers have been
studying the benefits of meditation for more
than 50 years, three people in particular have
helped popularize the practice by demonstrat-
ing how it can cause measurable improvement
in a broad range of health concerns.
 Herbert Benson and the Relaxation
Response: A cardiologist and professor of
medicine at Harvard Medical School,
Benson pioneered the field of mind-body
medicine with the publication of his best-
seller The Relaxation Response in 1975.
Based on his study of TM practitioners, the
book identifies a natural reflex mechanism
that can be triggered by 20 minutes of daily
meditation practice involving a quiet envi-
ronment, repetition of a sound or phrase, a
receptive attitude, and a comfortable sitting
position — a kind of generic TM!
Once initiated, this reflex apparently
induces relaxation, reduces stress, and
counteracts the fight-or-flight response. In
subsequent studies, Benson found that the
Relaxation Response had a beneficial effect
on hypertension, headaches, heart disease,
alcohol consumption, anxiety, and PMS.
 Jon Kabat-Zinn and Mindfulness-Based
Stress Reduction: Since 1979, when he
established the Stress Reduction Clinic at
the University of Massachusetts Medical
Center, Kabat-Zinn and his colleagues have
trained thousands of patients with a variety
of health problems in the fundamentals of
Buddhist mindfulness meditation and mind-
ful hatha yoga. Outcome studies indicate
that the eight-week program, which
involves formal classes, home-study, and a
one-day meditation workshop, helps partic-
ipants reduce the stress that contributes to
their illness and teaches them how to
extend the benefits of mindfulness into
every area of their lives.
Featured in the PBS series Healing and the
Mind with Bill Moyers, Kabat-Zinn’s pro-
gram has been duplicated in clinics,
schools, and workplaces across the country.
 Dean Ornish and the Opening Your Heart
Program: In a landmark study published in
the Journal of the American Medical
Association, Ornish, who is a physician and
the director of the nonprofit Preventive
Medicine Research Institute, showed that
patients can actually reverse their heart
disease through fundamental lifestyle
changes, without the use of surgery or cho-
lesterol-lowering drugs. Although his pro-
gram also emphasizes the health benefits of
a low-fat diet, exercise, and hatha yoga,
Ornish teaches that the key to healing the
heart lies in opening the heart — and that
meditation is a crucial component in this
process because it helps to free us from our
habitual patterns of stress and emotional
reactivity.

A Dozen More Great Reasons to Meditate
You don’t have to join some cult or get baptized or bar mitzvahed to enjoy the
benefits of meditation. And you don’t have to check out of your everyday life
and run off to a monastery in the Himalayas. You simply need to practice your
meditation regularly without trying to get anywhere or achieve anything. Like
interest in a money-market account, the benefits just accrue by themselves.
To awaken to the present moment
When you rush breathlessly from one moment to the next, anticipating
another problem or hungering for another pleasure, you miss the beauty and
immediacy of the present, which is constantly unfolding before your eyes.
Meditation teaches you to slow down and take each moment as it comes —
the sounds of traffic, the smell of new clothes, the laughter of children, the
worried look on an old woman’s face, the coming and going of your breath. In
fact, as the meditative traditions remind us, only the present moment exists
anyway — the past is just a memory and the future a fantasy, projected on
the movie screen of the mind right now.
To make friends with yourself
When you’re constantly struggling to live up to images and expectations
(your own or someone else’s) or racing to reinvent yourself to survive in a
competitive environment, you rarely have the opportunity or the motivation
to get to know yourself just the way you are. Self-doubt and self-hatred may
appear to fuel the fires of self-improvement, but they’re painful — and besides,
they contribute to other negative mind-states, such as fear, anger, depression,
and alienation, and prevent you from living up to your full potential.
When you meditate, you learn to welcome every experience and facet of your
being without judgment or denial. In the process, you begin to treat yourself
as you would a close friend, accepting (and even loving) the whole package,
the apparent weaknesses and shortcomings as well as the positive qualities
and strengths.
To connect more deeply with others
As you awaken to the present moment and open your heart and mind to your
own experience, you naturally extend this quality of awareness and presence
41
Chapter 2: Why Meditate?

to your relationships with family and friends. If you’re like the rest of us, you
tend to project your own desires and expectations onto the people close to
you, which acts as a barrier to real communication. But when you start to
accept others the way they are — a skill you can cultivate through the prac-
tice of meditation — you open up the channels for a deeper love and inti-
macy to flow between you.
To relax the body and calm the mind
As contemporary health researchers have discovered — and traditional texts
agree — mind and body are inseparable, and an agitated mind inevitably pro-
duces a stressed-out body. As the mind settles, relaxes, and opens during
meditation, so does the body — and the longer you meditate (measured both
in minutes logged each day and in days and weeks of regular practice), the
more this peace and relaxation ripples out to every area of your life, includ-
ing your health.
To lighten up
Perhaps you’ve noticed that nonstop thinking and worrying generate a kind
of inner claustrophobia — fears feed on one another, problems get magnified
exponentially, and the next thing you know, you’re feeling overwhelmed and
panicked. Meditation encourages an inner mental spaciousness in which diffi-
culties and concerns no longer seem so threatening and constructive solu-
tions can naturally arise — as well as a certain detachment that allows for
greater objectivity, perspective, and, yes, humor. That mysterious word
enlightenment actually refers to the supreme “lightening up”!
To enjoy more happiness
Research reveals that the daily practice of meditation for just a few months
actually makes people happier, as measured not only by their subjective
reports, but also by brain-mapping technology. (For more on meditation
research, see Chapter 19.) In fact, meditation is apparently the only thing that
can permanently change your emotional set point — your basic level of rela-
tive happiness that scientists say stays the same throughout your life, no
matter what you experience.
If you want lasting happiness, leading-edge science and spiritual wisdom
have the same advice to offer: Forget about winning the lottery or landing the
perfect job — and begin meditating instead!

To experience focus and flow
When you’re so fully involved in an activity that all sense of self-consciousness,
separation, and distraction dissolves, you’ve entered what psychologist
Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi calls a state of flow (see Chapter 1). For human
beings, this total immersion constitutes the ultimate enjoyment — and pro-
vides the ultimate antidote to the fragmentation and alienation of postmod-
ern life. No doubt you’ve experienced moments like these — creating a work
of art, playing a sport, working in the garden, making love. Athletes call it
“the zone.” Through meditation, you can discover how to give the same
focused attention to — and derive the same enjoyment from — every activity.
To feel more centered, grounded, 
and balanced
To counter the escalating insecurity of life in rapidly changing times, medita-
tion offers an inner groundedness and balance that external circumstances
can’t destroy. When you practice coming home again and again — to your
body, your breath, your sensations, your feelings — you eventually grow to
realize that you’re always home, no matter where you go. And when you
make friends with yourself — embracing the dark and the light, the weak and
the strong — you no longer get thrown off-center by the “slings and arrows”
of life.
To enhance your performance 
at work and at play
Studies have shown that basic meditation practice alone can enhance per-
ceptual clarity, creativity, self-actualization, and many of the other factors
that contribute to superior performance. In addition, specific meditations
have been devised to enhance performance in a variety of activities, from
sports to schoolwork (see Chapter 16).
To increase appreciation, 
gratitude, and love
As you begin to open to your experience without judgment or aversion, your
heart gradually opens as well — to yourself and others. You can practice 
43
Chapter 2: Why Meditate?

specific meditations for cultivating appreciation, gratitude, and love (see
Chapter 10). Or you may find, as so many meditators have before you, that
these qualities arise naturally when you can gaze at the world with fresh
eyes, free from the usual projections and expectations.
To align with a deeper sense of purpose
When you practice making the shift from doing and thinking to being (see
Chapter 1), you discover how to align yourself with a deeper current of mean-
ing and belonging. You may get in touch with personal feelings and aspira-
tions that have long remained hidden from your conscious awareness. Or you
may connect with a more universal source of purpose and direction — what
some people call the higher self or inner guidance.
To awaken to a spiritual 
dimension of being
As your meditation gradually opens you to the subtlety and richness of each
fleeting but irreplaceable moment, you may naturally begin to see through
the veil of appearances to the sacred reality at the heart of things — and you
eventually may come to realize (and this one could take lifetimes!) that the
very same sacred reality is actually who you are in your own heart of hearts.
This deep insight — what the sages and masters call “waking up from the illu-
sion of separation” — cuts through and ultimately eliminates loneliness and
alienation and opens you to the beauty of the human condition.

Getting into the habit
Take a habit that you wish you could break but
can’t. Maybe it’s smoking, drinking coffee, or
eating junk food. The next time you do it, instead
of spacing out or daydreaming, turn it into a
meditation. Pay close attention as you draw the
smoke into your lungs, for example, or chew the
French fries. Notice how your body feels.
Whenever your mind drifts off, notice where it
goes — you may have favorite fantasies that
accompany this habit — and then gently bring it
back to your experience.
Don’t try to stop or change the habit; just do it
as usual, except this time you’re doing it with full
awareness. The next time you indulge the habit,
notice how you feel. Has your attitude changed
in any way? What are you aware of this time
that you weren’t aware of before?

W
hen you think of meditation, do you envision an Asian monk or yogi in
loincloth or robe, sitting cross-legged in deep concentration? Well,
meditation was definitely refined in the temples, caves, and monasteries of
the East and Near East — and fortunately for you and me, it has made its way
West over the past 100 years or so. But meditation also appears, though less
conspicuously and in slightly different form, in the Judeo-Christian tradition.
Did you know, for example, that many of the biblical prophets meditated? Or
that Jesus engaged in some form of meditation when he retreated to the
desert for 40 days?
Meditation dates back to our earliest ancestors, who gazed in wonder at the
night sky, crouched in bushes for hours waiting for game, or sat in reverie
beside communal fires. Because meditation involves a shift from thinking and
doing to just being (see Chapter 1 for more about being), our forebears had a
headstart on you and me. After all, their lives were simpler, their thinking
more rudimentary, and their connection to nature and the sacred far stronger.
Although you can certainly practice meditation without knowing where it
comes from, tracing its development grounds it in a historical and spiritual
context. So, join me for a brief overview of meditation’s evolution as a sacred
practice in various parts of the world.

The Indian Connection
You can find meditation’s deepest roots in India, where sadhus (wandering
holy men and women) and yogis have cultivated the practice in one form or
another for more than 5,000 years. Attribute it to the climate, which slows the
pace of life, or to the monsoon, which forces people to spend more time
indoors, or just to the unbroken line of meditators over the ages. Whatever
the reasons, India provided the fertile soil in which the meditative arts flour-
ished and from which they spread both east and west.
The earliest Indian scriptures, the Vedas, don’t even have a word for medita-
tion, but the Vedic priests performed elaborate rites and chants to the gods
that required tremendous concentration. Eventually, these practices evolved
into a form of prayerful meditation that combined the use of breath control
and devotional focus on the Divine. (See Chapter 1 for more on focus.) The
deeper they delved, the more these priests realized that the worshipper and
the object of worship, the individual being and the divine being itself, are one
and the same — a profound insight that continued to inspire and instruct
spiritual seekers through the ages.

Shamans: The first great meditators
Long before the time of the Buddha or the great
Indian yogis, shamans in hunter-gatherer cul-
tures throughout the world used meditative
practices to enter altered states of conscious-
ness, known as trances. Focusing their minds
through drumming or rhythmic chanting; danc-
ing in simple, repetitive steps; and sometimes
using hallucinogenic plants, these men and
women left their bodies and journeyed to the
“world of the spirits.” From there they brought
back sacred wisdom, healing abilities, magical
powers, and spirit blessings for the sake of the
tribe.
Cave paintings dating back at least 15,000 years
depict figures lying on the ground in meditative
absorption. Scholars have determined that
these figures were shamans journeying in
trance to ask the spirits for a successful hunt.
Other cave paintings from a similar period show
shamans who transformed into animals — a
typical practice that continues to this day.
(Depending on your belief system, you may be
inclined to dismiss such experiences as figments
of an overactive imagination. But the shamans
and their followers have no doubt that such jour-
neys and transformations actually occur.)
Though shamanism declined with the shift from
hunting and gathering to farming, shamans 
still act as healers, guides for the dead, and
intermediaries between humans and spirits 
in parts of Siberia, North America, Mexico,
South America, Africa, Australia, Indonesia, and
Asia. In recent years, through the writings of
Carlos Castaneda, Michael Harner, and Joseph
Campbell, more and more Westerners have
taken an interest in shamanism — and some
have even become accomplished shamans
themselves.

From the garden of Vedic and post-Vedic spirituality sprouted three of India’s
best-known meditative traditions — yoga, Buddhism, and tantra — which I
cover in the following sections.
Classical yoga: The path of blissful union
When you think of yoga, do you picture people twisting and stretching their
bodies into challenging poses? Even if you practice hatha yoga yourself, what
you may not know is that such “poses” are just one component of the tradi-
tional path of classical yoga, which includes breath control and meditation.
(For a comprehensive introduction to yoga, check out Yoga For Dummies by
Georg Feuerstein and Larry Payne, published by Wiley.)
The practitioner of classical yoga aims to withdraw from the material world,
which is considered illusory, and merge with the formless but ultimate reality
of consciousness. After preparing the body with asanas (the familiar hatha
yoga poses), cultivating refined energy states through various breathing prac-
tices, and excluding all external distractions, the yogi focuses on an interme-
diate object, such as a mantra (repetition of a meaningful word or phrase) or
47
Chapter 3: Where Meditation Comes From
The art of the mantra
As Herbert Benson, M.D., explains in his
groundbreaking book The Relaxation Response,
the meditative repetition of a mantra tends to
calm the mind and relax the body. But the earli-
est practitioners of mantra had more spiritual
intentions, such as invoking the power of a par-
ticular deity, cultivating and strengthening pos-
itive qualities, or achieving union with divine
reality.
Though the term mantra (meaning “mind pro-
tection”) derives from the Sanskrit, the practice
appears in one form or another in virtually every
religion. Sufis repeat the phrase La ila’ha,
il’alahu (“There is nothing but God”), Christians
say the “Our Father” or the prayer of the heart
(“Lord Jesus Christ have mercy on me”),
Buddhists intone sacred invocations like om
mani padme hum or namu amida butsu, and
Hindus repeat one of the many praises or
names of God.
Essentially, mantras are sounds infused with
numinous or spiritual power by a teacher or a
tradition. When you repeat a mantra — either
aloud, under your breath, or mentally (actually
considered the most potent method) — you res-
onate with a particular spiritual frequency and
with the power and blessings the sound has
accumulated over the years.
The practice of mantra focuses and stabilizes
the mind and protects it from unwanted dis-
tractions. For this reason, mantra recitation
often accompanies more formal meditation
practices. To experiment with mantra, just
choose a word or phrase with deep personal or
spiritual meaning for you. (Traditionally, you
would receive a particular mantra directly from
your teacher.) Then sit quietly and repeat it
again and again, allowing your mind to rest on
the sound and the feeling it evokes. When your
mind wanders, just come back to your mantra.

a sacred symbol, and then on consciousness itself. Finally, the yogi arrives at
a state known as samadhi, where all traces of separation dissolve and the
yogi blissfully unites with consciousness.
Compiled and codified by Patanjali (a sage of the second century A.D.), the
philosophy and practices of classical yoga gave rise to numerous and, at
times, competing schools over the centuries. Most of the yogis and swamis
who have taught in the West trace their lineage to classical yoga.
Early Buddhism: The roots of 
mindfulness meditation
The historical Buddha was a Hindu prince who, according to the traditional
account, renounced his luxurious life to find answers to the mystery of suffer-
ing, old age, and death. After practicing asceticism and yoga for many years,
he decided that rejecting the world and mortifying the flesh would not lead to
the understanding he sought. Instead, he sat down under a tree and began
looking deeply into his own mind. After seven days and nights of intensive
meditation, he woke up to the nature of existence — hence the name Buddha,
or “the awakened one.”
The Buddha taught that we suffer because we cling to the false belief that (a)
things are permanent and can be relied upon for happiness and (b) we have
an abiding self that exists independently of other beings and makes us who
we are. Instead, he taught that everything changes constantly — our minds,
our emotions, our sense of self, and the circumstances and objects in the
external world.
To be free from suffering, he counseled, we must liberate ourselves from 
ignorance and eliminate fear, anger, greed, jealousy, and other negative mind-
states. The approach he prescribed involves both practices for working with
the mind and guidelines for living in the world in a virtuous and spiritual way.
(For a comprehensive introduction to the teachings and practices of Buddhism,
check out Buddhism For Dummies by Jonathan Landaw and Stephan Bodian,
published by Wiley.)
Meditation lies at the heart of the historical Buddha’s approach. The practice
of meditation he taught, known as mindfulness, involves wakeful attention to
our experience from moment to moment.
Here are the four traditional foundations of mindfulness:
 Awareness of the body
 Awareness of feelings
48
Part I: Getting Acquainted 

 Awareness of thoughts and mind-states
 Awareness of the laws of experience (the relationships between what we
think and what we experience)
Departing from the other teachers of his day, who generally recommended
withdrawing from the world to seek ecstatic union with the Divine, the
Buddha taught the importance of gaining direct insight into the nature of
existence and into how the mind creates suffering. He likened himself to a
physician who offers medicine to heal wounds, rather than a philosopher
who provides abstract answers to metaphysical questions.
Indian tantra: Finding the sacred 
in the world of the senses
Many Westerners associate the word tantra with traditional sexual practices
that have been adapted to appeal to a popular audience. However, tantra
developed in the early centuries A.D. as a major form of Indian spiritual prac-
tice and thought. Believing that absolute reality and the relative world of the
senses are inseparable, tantrikas (practitioners of tantra) use the senses —
including the practice of ritual sex — as gateways to spiritual realization.
Needless to say, such an approach has its pitfalls; whereas yoga and Buddhism
can veer toward life-denial, tantra can be confused with sensual indulgence.
Tantric meditation frequently involves practices for awakening the kundalini
shakti, believed to be a powerful energy associated with the divine feminine
that resides at the base of the spine. Once stimulated, the shakti rises through
an energetic channel located in the spine and activates and opens each of the
seven energy centers, or chakras, in its path. These centers, which vibrate at
different frequencies and are associated with different physical and psycho-
logical functions, are located at the perineum, the genitals, the solar plexus,
the heart, the throat, the forehead, and the crown of the head, respectively.
(For more on chakras, turn to Chapter 12.) Ultimately, the shakti may erupt
through the crown chakra in a burst of ecstasy. At this point, the practitioner
realizes his or her identity with the Divine, while still fully contained in a phys-
ical body.
To the Roof of the World — and Beyond
Before it left India for good at the end of the first millennium A.D., Buddhism
went through significant changes. The early teachings developed into what
we now call Theravada — the dominant approach in Sri Lanka and Southeast
49
Chapter 3: Where Meditation Comes From

Asia, emphasizing a progressive path to liberation largely limited to monks
and nuns. At the same time, another major current emerged that preached
the ideal of the bodhisattva — the person who dedicates his or her life to lib-
erating others. Known as the Mahayana (“the great vehicle”), this second
major branch of Buddhism was more egalitarian and offered the possibility of
enlightenment to everyone, whether lay or monastic.
From India, wandering monks and scholars transported Mahayana Buddhism
over the Himalayas (the “roof of the world”) to China and Tibet. There it min-
gled with indigenous spiritual teachings, set down roots, and evolved into a
number of different traditions and schools, most notably Ch’an (Zen in
Japanese) and Vajrayana Buddhism, which took the practice of meditation to
new heights. (For more on the different branches of Buddhism, see Buddhism
For Dummies.)
Ch’an (Zen): The sound of one hand
You’ve no doubt read about the Zen masters who whacked their disciples with
a stick or bellowed instructions at the tops of their lungs. But you may not real-
ize that Zen is a unique blend of Mahayana Buddhism (which is egalitarian) and
the native Chinese tradition known as Taoism (which emphasizes the seamless
and undivided nature of life, known as the Tao). (Although Indian monks began
transporting Buddhism to China in the early centuries A.D., Zen did not emerge
as a separate current until the seventh or eighth century.) Zen departed radi-
cally from traditional Buddhism by emphasizing direct, wordless transmission
of the enlightened state from master to disciple — sometimes through behav-
ior that, by ordinary standards, would be considered eccentric or even bizarre.
While the other traditions of Buddhism increasingly focused on scriptural
study, Zen cut through the metaphysical underbrush and said: Just sit!
Meditation became the primary means for dismantling a lifetime of attach-
ment to the material world and realizing what the Zen masters call Buddha
nature, the innate wisdom that exists within each of us.
Zen also introduced those seemingly unsolvable riddles known as koans —
for example, “What is the sound of one hand?” or “What was your original
face before your parents were born?” By totally immersing himself in the
koan, the monk could ultimately see into the nature of existence — what the
Zen masters called satori.
In Japan, Zen developed some of its notorious samurai intensity and gave rise
to the austere, pristine aesthetic that has made rock gardens and brush paint-
ings so typical of Japanese culture. From Japan, of course, Zen made its way
to North America, encountered the Beat generation of the 1950s, and set the
stage for the recent explosion of interest in meditation. (For more on Zen in
North America, see the section “The Americanization of Meditation,” later in
this chapter.)

Vajrayana Buddhism: The way 
of transformation
Like China (where Buddhism encountered Taoism), Tibet had its indigenous
religion, called Bonpo, which included magical practices designed to appease
the local spirits and deities. When the great Indian master Padmasambhava
brought Buddhism from India to Tibet in the seventh century A.D., he first had
to conquer the hostile spirits that resisted his efforts. Ultimately, these spir-
its were incorporated into Tibetan Buddhism as protectors and allies in an
elaborate pantheon that included various Buddhas and dakinis (awakened
women).
Tibetan Buddhists believed that the historical Buddha taught simultaneously
at different levels, depending on the needs and abilities of his disciples. The
most advanced teachings, they said, were kept secret for centuries and ulti-
mately conveyed to Tibet as the Vajrayana (“the diamond way”). In addition
to traditional mindfulness meditation, this approach incorporated elements
of Indian tantra and involved powerful practices for working with energy.
Instead of eliminating negative emotions and mind-states like anger, greed,
and fear, as traditional Buddhism recommends, the Vajrayana teaches practi-
tioners how to transform negativity directly into wisdom and compassion.
Meditation in Tibetan Buddhism also employs visualization — the active use
of the imagination to invoke potent spiritual forces that fuel the process of
spiritual realization.
From the Middle East to 
the Rest of the West
Although meditation in the Judeo-Christian and Islamic traditions had its own
independent development, meditators in the Middle East may have been
influenced by the practices of their counterparts in India and Southeast Asia
(see the earlier sections of this chapter). Historians do have evidence that
traders and pilgrims traveled between the two regions constantly, and
Buddhist monks appeared in Rome in early Christian times! There’s even the
rumor, buoyed by some interesting historical coincidences, that Jesus may
have learned how to meditate in India. While Indian meditators — following
the ancient insight that atman equals Brahman (“I and the ground of being are
one”) — turned their attention progressively inward, seeking the sacred in
the depths of their own being, Western thinkers and theologians pointed to a
God that purportedly exists outside the individual. At the same time, mystics
in the West wrestled with the paradox that God is both inside and outside,
personal and transcendent.
51
Chapter 3: Where Meditation Comes From

Meditation in the Western religions usually takes the form of prayer — that is,
direct communion with God. But the meditative prayer of the monks and
mystics differs from ordinary prayer, which often includes complaints and
requests. Instead, meditative prayer approaches God with humility and devo-
tion, contemplates His divine qualities, and invites His presence into the
heart of the meditator. Ultimately, the goal is to surrender the individual self
completely in union with the Divine.
Christian meditation: Practicing 
contemplative prayer
The Christian equivalent of meditation, known as contemplative prayer, dates
back to Jesus himself, who fasted and prayed in the desert for 40 days and
nights. In contemplation, says Father Thomas Keating, whose “centering
prayer” has helped revitalize interest in Christian meditation, you open your
awareness and your heart to God, the ultimate mystery, who dwells in the
depths of your being, beyond the reach of the mind. (See the “Centering
prayer” sidebar for more about the practice taught by Father Keating.)
After the time of Jesus, the first great Christian meditators were the desert
fathers of Egypt and Palestine in the third and fourth centuries, who lived
largely in solitude and cultivated awareness of the Divine presence through
constant repetition of a sacred phrase. Their direct descendants, the monks,
nuns, and mystics of medieval Europe, developed the contemplative practice
of repeating and ruminating over a scriptural passage (not to be confused
with thinking about or analyzing it!) until its deeper significance revealed
itself to the mind. Both of these practices, explains Father Keating, hark back
to Jesus’s admonition, “When you pray, go into your closet, your innermost
being, and bolt the door.”
In the Eastern Orthodox Church of Greece and Eastern Europe, monks have
long engaged in a similar practice combining prostrations (full-body bows)
with the repetition of the Jesus prayer (“Lord Jesus Christ have mercy on me,
a sinner”) until all practices drop away to reveal a deep interior silence filled
with love and bliss.
In recent years, many Christian ministers and monastics have been influ-
enced by the Hindu and Buddhist teachers who have appeared in the West in
increasing numbers. (See the section “The Americanization of Meditation,”
later in this chapter.) In response, some have adapted Eastern practices to
the needs of Christian audiences. Others, like Father Keating, have delved
into their own contemplative roots and resuscitated practices that had
become dusty with disuse.

Meditation in Judaism: 
Drawing closer to God
According to Rami Shapiro, rabbi of Temple Beth Or in Miami, Florida, and
author of Wisdom of the Jewish Sages, mystical interpreters of the Bible have
found evidence of meditation dating back to Abraham, the founder of Judaism.
The Old Testament prophets apparently entered into altered states of con-
sciousness through fasting and ascetic practices, and mystics in the first few
centuries A.D. meditated on a vision of the prophet Ezekiel.
But the first formal Jewish meditation, says Shapiro, centered on the Hebrew
alphabet, which was considered the divine language through which God created
the world. “If you could see into the alphabet,” explains Shapiro, “you could see
into the source of creation and thereby become one with the creator Himself.”
Like practitioners in all the God-centered religions, Jewish meditators have
traditionally used sacred phrases or verses from scripture as mantras to
bring them closer to God. As one great Hasidic master used to say of the
53
Chapter 3: Where Meditation Comes From
Centering prayer
Developed in the past few decades by Father
Thomas Keating, a Catholic priest, and based on
traditional Christian sources, centering prayer
is a contemplative practice that opens the mind
and heart to the Divine presence. Unlike a
mantra, which is designed to clarify or calm the
mind, centering prayer purifies the heart to
become a vehicle for God’s transformative
grace. Instead of repeating it again and again
like a mantra, you hold it in your awareness as
an object of contemplation.
Here are the instructions for practicing center-
ing prayer, as given by Father Keating (whose
words appear in quotation marks):
1. Choose a “sacred word as a symbol of your
intention to consent to God’s presence and
action within.”
2. Settle comfortably, and silently introduce
the sacred word.
When your attention wanders, gently bring
it back.
3. Stay with the same word during the period
of contemplation.
Some people may prefer to “turn inwardly
toward God as if gazing upon him,” without
words. In any case, the same guidelines apply.
When we open to God, says Father Keating, we
find that God is “closer than breathing, closer
than thinking, closer than choosing — closer
than consciousness itself.”

phrase r’bono shel olam (“master of the universe”), if you just repeat it con-
tinuously, you will achieve union with God. And it is precisely this union that
Jewish meditation intends to induce.
Like Christianity, Judaism has been inspired by Eastern influences in recent
years to revive its own meditative traditions. Rabbis like Shapiro (who prac-
tices Zen meditation) and David Cooper (who trained in Buddhist mindful-
ness meditation) are creating a Jewish meditative renaissance by forging a
new synthesis of ancient techniques from East and West.
Meditation among the Sufis: Surrendering
to the Divine with every breath
Since the time of the prophet Mohammed in the seventh century A.D., Sufis
have worn the garments of Islam. But, according to the American-born Sufi
teacher Shabda Kahn, their roots go back much farther, beyond Mohammed
or Buddha or other famous teachers, to the first awakened person. Sufis
claim to be a fellowship of mystical seekers whose sole purpose is to realize
the Divine in their own hearts. The forms of Sufism have varied from century
to century and teacher to teacher and from one geographical location to
another, but the basic teaching is the same: There is nothing but God.
Meditation in Sufism generally takes the form of chanting a sacred phrase,
either silently or out loud, while breathing deeply and rhythmically — a prac-
tice known as zikr, “remembrance of the Divine.” Kahn explains that Sufis

Contemplating the stars
In his book Jewish Meditation, Rabbi Aryeh
Kaplan describes a traditional technique based
on the biblical verse “Lift your eyes on high and
see who created these [stars], the One who
brings out their host by number, He calls them
all by name . . .” (Isaiah 40:26):
1. On a clear night, lie or sit comfortably out
of doors, gazing up at the stars.
2. While repeating a mantra, focus your atten-
tion on the stars as though you are probing
them to reveal the mystery behind them.
You can use the traditional Jewish mantra
r’bono shel olam to help you deepen your
concentration and your sense of the
sacred. Or feel free to use a mantra of your
own choosing.
As Rabbi Kaplan puts it, you are “calling to
God in the depths of the heavens, seeking
to find Him beyond the stars, beyond the
very limits of time and space.”
3. Remain absorbed in your contemplation for
as long as you want.
According to Rabbi Kaplan, this meditation “can
bring a person to an overwhelmingly deep spir-
itual experience.”

retranslate the biblical beatitude “Blessed are the poor in spirit” to “Blessed
are those who have a refined breath.” When the Sufi has cultivated and
refined the breath, he or she can use it as a method for surrendering to the
divine presence in each moment — with every breath.
The Americanization of Meditation
If you harken back to the counterculture of the 1960s and 1970s to find the first
seeds of meditation on American soil, you may be surprised to discover that
the roots go far deeper. Some of the earliest settlers transplanted Eastern ideas
when they fled to the colonies, seeking freedom for their particular brand of
Christianity. And many of the framers of the Declaration of Independence and
the U.S. Constitution — men like Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin —
belonged to secret fraternities informed by the mystical teachings of Sufism
and Judaism.
Transcendentalism and Theosophy
(1840–1900)
The first major influx of Eastern teachings began in the 1840s and 1850s, when
Transcendentalists like Emerson and Thoreau read Hindu scriptures in English
translations of German adaptations from the Sanskrit! While Thoreau, whose
ideas on civil disobedience were influenced by Eastern philosophy, withdrew
to Walden Pond to meditate in nature, his good friend Emerson was blending

Toward the one
To prepare for more-advanced meditative prac-
tices, Sufis often begin with a darood — the
recitation of a sacred phrase coordinated with
the breath. The American-born Sufi master
Samuel Lewis, who died in 1971, taught the fol-
lowing exercise:
1. Start to walk in a rhythmic fashion and syn-
chronize your breathing with your pace —
four steps for each inhalation and four
steps for each exhalation.
2. As you walk, repeat the phrase “toward the
one” — one syllable per step with a silent
space on the fourth step.
Walking develops and strengthens the
rhythm of the breath.
3. Continue for as long as you like, with
wholehearted attention.
“The Sufi practices living in the breath 24 hours
a day,” says Shabda Kahn, a Sufi teacher who
studied with Lewis.

German idealism, Yankee optimism, and Indian spirituality to formulate his ver-
sion of the Transcendentalist credo. In the process, he transformed the Hindu
Brahman (the divine ground of being) into a more universal concept that he
called the Oversoul.
Later in the century, the Theosophists — members of a largely Western move-
ment, led by the Russian-born Madame Blavatsky, who adapted and popular-
ized Indian spiritual thought — made Hindu meditation texts available to the
ordinary reader, and followers of the New Thought movement practiced
guided visualizations and mantra meditations adapted from Eastern sources.
But the landmark meditation event of the 19th century turned out to be the
World Parliament of Religions, an international gathering of religious leaders
and teachers held in Chicago in 1893. For the first time, Asian masters pre-
sented their teachings directly to Westerners on American soil. Following 
the conference, several of the masters (including the Indian sage Swami
Vivekananda and the Japanese Zen teacher Soyen Shaku) toured the United
States lecturing to interested audiences.
Yoga and Zen prepare the soil

In the decades following the World Parliament, the Zen monk Nyogen Senzaki
continued Soyen Shaku’s work of sowing the seeds of meditation in the New
World, and Swami Paramananda, a disciple of Swami Vivekananda, estab-
lished centers where curious Americans could practice meditation and hear
sophisticated Indian spiritual teachings. (The Vedanta Society, which grew up
around the work of swamis Vivekananda and Paramananda and their disci-
ples, continues to flourish in the United States and Europe.) In the 1920s, the
Indian yogi Paramahansa Yogananda settled in the United States, and his
work gradually blossomed into the Self-Realization Fellowship, which today
boasts followers throughout the Western world.
Perhaps the best-known spiritual teacher to arrive during this period was J.
Krishnamurti, who settled in Southern California in the 1940s and attracted
the English writers Aldous Huxley and Christopher Isherwood. Although
Krishnamurti (who was groomed from childhood to be a world teacher by
the Theosophists) shunned formal meditation and religious dogma in favor of
dialogue and self-inquiry, Huxley and Isherwood helped to popularize the
great Hindu scriptures.
By the 1950s, Zen began to significantly influence the American countercul-
ture. While the poet Gary Snyder (who later won the Pulitzer Prize for his
book Turtle Island) was off studying Zen in Japan, his friend and Beat col-
league Jack Kerouac wrote novels that popularized Buddhist concepts such
as dharma, karma, and satori. Also in the ’50s, the great Japanese scholar D.

T. Suzuki began teaching Zen at Columbia University in New York City, where
his audiences included the young Thomas Merton, novelist J. D. Salinger,
composer John Cage, and psychoanalysts Erich Fromm and Karen Horney.
About the same time, the books of former Episcopalian priest and Zen afi-
cionado Alan Watts — including The Way of Zen and Psychotherapy East and
West — became popular sellers.
Meditation reaches Main Street 
(1960 to the present)
In the 1960s, a unique cluster of events set the stage for the mainstreaming of
meditation. Many Baby Boomers, who were now reaching young adulthood,
began experimenting with altered states of consciousness by using so-called
mind-expanding drugs like marijuana and LSD. At the same time, the war in
Vietnam prompted a national backlash among a sizable segment of the popu-
lation and helped forge a counterculture opposed in many ways to the status
quo. Popular music fueled the fires of discontent and touted the benefits of
“tuning in, turning on, and dropping out” — words that in another time,
place, and context might have referred to renouncing the world in favor of
57
Chapter 3: Where Meditation Comes From
Spirituality or religion?
Polls cited in Newsweek indicate that more and
more Americans consider themselves spiritual
but not necessarily religious. You may be one of
many who have given up their childhood creed,
but feel drawn, nevertheless, to spiritual ques-
tions and practices. You may find organized reli-
gion too limited by its rituals and belief systems,
too focused on archaic symbols and stories, and
not sufficiently concerned with supporting you in
your search for direct spiritual experience.
Religions generally begin with a vital spiritual
impulse — look at the lives of Jesus,
Mohammed, or Buddha — but often grow rigid
over the centuries like an old tree and lose
touch with their living spiritual essence. Gen-
uine spirituality keeps resurfacing within reli-
gions, however, as an esoteric undercurrent.
The establishment may view it with skepticism
or even scorn but allow it to flourish as long 
as it doesn’t threaten the status quo. Judaism
has its kabbalists and Hasids, Islam its Sufis,
Buddhism its Zen masters and forest monks,
Christianity its Franciscans and Carmelites.
If you want a sense of meaning and belonging
that comes from viewing your life in a broader
metaphysical and historical context, conven-
tional, name-brand religion may be your cup of
tea. But if you want to awaken to the meaning
of life and seek the inner transformation
afforded by the practice of meditation or some
other spiritual discipline, you’re better off fer-
reting out one of the esoteric undercurrents
within the religious mainstream — or simply fol-
lowing a meditative practice that offers the pos-
sibility of direct spiritual experience but has no
affiliation with traditional religion. (For more on
spiritual practices, see Chapter 14.)

the monastic life. And political unrest in Asia (including shock waves from
Vietnam and the Chinese takeover of Tibet) combined with the spirit of the
times to bring a new wave of spiritual teachers to the New World.
From the standpoint of meditation, perhaps the landmark event of this era was
the conversion of the Beatles to the practice of Transcendental Meditation
(TM), which prompted thousands of their young fans to begin meditating, too.
(Over the years, the TM movement has taught millions of Westerners how to
meditate and has pioneered research revealing the mind-body benefits of medi-
tation.) As psychedelics lost their luster, more and more people who had
looked to drugs to provide meditative experiences like peace and insight
turned to the real thing — and some even took refuge in the yoga communities
and Zen centers constructed by their newfound teachers.
Since the 1970s, a new generation, with the savvy to translate the teachings
for their brothers and sisters, has emerged in the West as sanctioned teach-
ers of Eastern spiritual disciplines. As Alan Watts anticipated (in his book
Psychotherapy East and West), the field of psychotherapy has been particu-
larly open to Eastern influences — perhaps because psychotherapy, like med-
itation, purports to offer a solution for suffering. As a result, American
spiritual teachers often couch their messages in language that appeals to pro-
ponents of “personal growth.”
At the same time, scientific researchers like Herbert Benson, Jon Kabat-Zinn,
and Dean Ornish have pioneered the mainstreaming of meditation (see the side-
bar “Promoting the benefits of meditation” in Chapter 2), and books on medita-
tion and related topics regularly appear on the New York Times bestseller list. In
one six-month period recently, Time magazine ran a cover story on the growing
popularity of Buddhism, and Newsweek ran covers featuring the faces of Ornish
and best-selling author and meditation expert Deepak Chopra. Without doubt,
meditation has emerged as a mainstream American practice!

Native American meditation
When I describe the “Americanization” of med-
itation, I’m revealing my cultural bias. Clearly,
Native Americans have been meditating here
for tens of thousands of years. In addition to
shamans, who play a special role in the life of
the tribe (see the sidebar “Shamans: The first
great meditators”), Native American boys and
girls often mark the transition from childhood 
to adulthood by spending three or four days
meditating alone in a sacred spot. By fasting,
praying, focusing their minds, and opening their
senses, they solicit dreams or visions that bring
them special wisdom or power and help them
contact their guardian spirits. As adults, Native
Americans may also meditate alone in nature
when they need spiritual sustenance or
answers to important life questions. In addition,
the practice of moment-to-moment mindfulness
has always been an essential ingredient of tra-
ditional Native American life.

The Future of Meditation
Now that meditation has become so popular in the West, you may wonder
how its influence will expand and evolve over the decades to come. Needless
to say, no one really knows, but I’d be happy to offer some informed specula-
tion, based on recent developments and cutting-edge research.
Some of the latest scientific studies use state-of-the-art technology to prove
that regular meditation makes you happier, more empathic, and more resis-
tant to disease (see Chapter 19). Coupled with earlier studies indicating a
host of other health benefits, this growing body of research could lead to the
mainstreaming of meditation in a number of important ways.
Take two meditations and 
call me in the morning
More and more doctors may prescribe regular sitting practice along with
insulin, beta blockers, and blood-pressure medication for patients with seri-
ous illnesses like diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension. Indeed, many
healthcare practitioners already do! If the research into meditation’s benefits
continues to yield such convincing results, HMOs and other medical organi-
zations may ultimately require physicians to include it as standard practice
for certain ailments.
Talking back to Prozac
Mindfulness meditation has no harmful side effects and permanently lifts the
mood of those who practice it for just three months (see Chapter 19). Then
why don’t psychiatrists dispense it first to their depressed or anxious
patients, before potentially dangerous mind-altering drugs? Beats me! In a few
years, though, more and more shrinks may be counseling their patients to
follow their breathing as well as take their medication — and the book you
hold in your hands may find its rightful place on psychiatrists’ shelves, along-
side the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders!
The more you sit, the less you pay
The work of Dean Ornish and other researchers  has prompted some insur-
ance companies to reimburse for stress-management programs and some
hospitals to create their own. In the same way, the growing evidence for the
health benefits of meditation may lead to a reduction in insurance premiums
59
Chapter 3: Where Meditation Comes From

for those who meditate regularly — and to the offering of meditation classes
in every hospital and clinic. Maybe you’ll even get reimbursed for the occa-
sional meditation retreat — after  your co-pay, of course!
Spinning, stretching, and sitting
As the health benefits of meditation are more widely accepted and acknowl-
edged, health clubs, spas, and resorts may increasingly include meditation
classes and workshops alongside aerobics, spinning, weight-training, and
hatha yoga. After all, meditation enhances your enjoyment of life at every
level — and what better time to enjoy life than on a vacation!
Beyond these more obvious applications for meditation, I anticipate that
meditation will become a more pervasive presence on the cultural landscape.
Perhaps you’ll be able to access meditation courses on TV, hear celebrity
meditators eager to talk about their practice, and find regular references to
meditation on sitcoms and talk shows, in newspapers and magazines. Some
other, more visionary possibilities: meditation booths in public places, 
meditation classes in public schools, regular meditation breaks instead of
coffee breaks in the workplace, meditation rooms next to board rooms in 
corporations — even meditation meetings beside prayer meetings in the halls
of Congress! And why not? Because meditation reduces stress and improves
health without ideological baggage, it’s primed to infiltrate our lives in
unprecedented — and unpredictable — new ways.

to become aware of how gravity acts on
your body.
2. Notice the weight of your legs and hips
against the chair.

 Checking out five basic motivational styles

A
s an effective practice for reprogramming your mind and opening your
heart, meditation has no parallel. But traditionally, meditation never
stands alone — it’s always accompanied by an emphasis on motivation and
attitude (that is, on the qualities of mind that fuel the fires of meditation and
keep you going when the going gets tough).
Some meditation teachers may urge you to take a vow to dedicate your medi-
tation to the well-being of others, rather than hoarding all the goodies for
yourself. Others may ask you to consider your deepest aspirations or inten-
tions or attitudes — what one Zen master calls your “inmost request.”
Whatever the term used to describe it, you need to look deeply into your own
mind and heart to clarify the reasons that motivate you to meditate. Then
you can consult this motivation when the practice becomes boring and
uneventful — which it inevitably does.
My teenage nephew aspires to become a professional baseball player. Despite
the odds, he might just make it — he’s a 6'5" left-hander with a mean fastball
and the work ethic of a winner. Recently, he asked me to teach him how to
meditate so he can pitch with more poise and composure. Then there’s my
thirtysomething cousin with a Harvard M.B.A., who works at a prestigious East
Coast investment firm. When we talked by phone the other day, he wondered
whether meditation could help relieve the unremitting stress that comes with
his job. A close friend in her fifties who was just diagnosed with breast cancer
wants to learn how to meditate in order to deal with her fear and facilitate her
healing. And one of my therapy clients asked for meditation instruction to help

quiet her mind so she can get a clearer picture of the recurring patterns of
thinking and acting that disrupt her life and make her unhappy.
You may be driven to meditate by pain or suffering or desperation of some
kind, or you may simply be dissatisfied with the quality of your life — the
level of stress, the lack of enjoyment, the speed and intensity. Whatever your
story, you need to be sufficiently motivated if you’re ever going to take the
trouble to change your routine, slow down, and turn your attention inward
for 15 or 20 minutes each day. In this chapter, you have an opportunity to
face your unique brand of dissatisfaction — and cultivate the motivation that
keeps you meditating, week after week.
Beginning (and Ending) 
with Beginner’s Mind
Ultimately, the great meditation teachers advise that the best attitude to take
toward meditation is an open mind, completely free from all preconceptions
and expectations. One of my first meditation teachers, Zen master Shunryu
Suzuki, calls this beginner’s mind — and he counsels that the goal of medita-
tion is not to accumulate knowledge, learn something new, or achieve some
special state of mind, but simply to maintain this fresh, uncluttered perspective.
“If your mind is empty, it is always ready for anything; it is open to every-
thing,” he writes in his book Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind. “In the beginner’s
mind, there are many possibilities; in the expert’s mind, there are few.” As the
title of his book suggests, Suzuki teaches that beginner’s mind and Zen mind —
the awake, clear, unfettered mind of the enlightened Zen master — are essen-
tially the same. Or, as another teacher puts it, “The seeker is the sought; the
looker is what he or she is looking for!”
Needless to say, it’s easier to talk about beginner’s mind than it is to maintain
or even recognize it. But that’s precisely the point — the “don’t-know mind”
of the beginner can’t conceptualize or identify beginner’s mind, just as the
eye can’t see itself, even though it is the source of all seeing. No matter which
meditation technique you choose, try to practice it with the innocent, open,
“don’t-know” spirit of beginner’s mind. In a sense, beginner’s mind is the non-
attitude underlying all attitudes, the non-technique at the heart of all success-
ful techniques.
Here are the characteristics of beginner’s mind:
 Openness to whatever arises: When you welcome your experience in
meditation without trying to change it, you align yourself with being
62
Part I: Getting Acquainted 

itself, which includes everything — light and dark, good and bad, life
and death — without preference.
 Freedom from expectations: When you practice beginner’s mind, you
encounter each moment with fresh eyes and ears. Instead of meditating
to achieve some future goal, you sit with the confidence that the open,
ready awareness you bring to it ultimately contains all the qualities 
you seek, such as love, peace, happiness, compassion, wisdom, and
equanimity.
 Spacious and spontaneous mind: Some teachers liken beginner’s mind
to the sky — though the clouds may come and go, the boundless
expanse of sky is never damaged or reduced in any way. As for spon-
taneity, Jesus summed it up when he said, “You must become as little
children to enter the kingdom of heaven.” Free from expectations and
open to whatever arises, you naturally respond to situations in a sponta-
neous way.
 Original, primordial awareness: A famous Zen koan (provocative
riddle) goes like this: “What was your original face before your parents
were born?” This koan points to the ineffable, primordial quality of
mind, which predates your personality and even your physical body.
Perhaps beginner’s mind should really be called beginningless mind!
63
Chapter 4: Laying the Foundation: Motivation, Attitude, and Beginner’s Mind
Your end is your beginning
It’s one of the great mysteries of meditation that
you inevitably end up where you began. Like
Simon in the sidebar “Discovering the treasure
in your own house” in Chapter 1, you ultimately
find that the treasure was hidden under your
own hearth all along — and the path you follow
only serves to lead you home again. As T. S. Eliot
put it in his poem “Four Quartets,” “The end of
all our exploring/Will be to arrive where we
started/And know the place for the first time.”
To clarify this mystery, the Tibetans make a dis-
tinction between the ground, the path, and the
fruition. The confused, busy, suffering mind,
they say, has within it the peace, love, and hap-
piness you seek — the ground or basis for
awakening. But the clouds of negativity (doubt,
judgment, fear, anger, attachment) that obscure
this ground — which is who you really are in
your heart of hearts — have become so thick
and impenetrable that you need to embark on
the path of meditation to clear away the clouds
and bring you closer to the truth.
When you finally recognize your essential 
being — the moment of fruition — you realize
that it has always been right here, where and
who you already are, nearer than your own
heart, more immediate than your breath. This
essential being is identical to what the Zen folks
call beginner’s mind.

What Motivates You to Meditate?
We don’t talk much in our culture about motivation — unless it’s deficient or
missing and we need to amp it up and “get motivated.” In your own life, you
may be the kind of person who does what comes naturally or does it because
it’s fun — or exciting or educational or merely interesting. Or perhaps you’re
the responsible sort who fills her life with obligations and spends her time
meeting them.
Whatever your motivational style, you may find, on closer investigation, that
the motivation or attitude you bring to an activity has a dramatic impact on
your experience of the activity. Take sex, for example. If you do it out of lust or
boredom or fear, your sexual pleasure will be permeated by the flavor of the
feeling that motivated you. But if you have sex as a heartfelt expression of love
for your partner, you may move in the same way, touch the same places, use
the same techniques — but you’ll have an exponentially different experience.
Well, meditation is like sex — what you bring to it is what you get! In fact, the
meditative traditions suggest that your motivation determines the outcome of
your practice as much as the technique you use or the time you spend. Just as
clients in Jungian therapy proverbially have Jungian dreams and Freudian
clients have Freudian dreams, Christian meditators tend to experience God or
Christ, Buddhist meditators see emptiness — and those who seek healing or
peace of mind or peak performance tend to get what they came for.
Spiritual traditions often rank attitudes and motivations as higher or lower,
and they generally agree that the motivation to help others before helping
oneself is the highest. But you have to begin where you are — and being

Empty your cup
There’s an old Zen story about a scholar who
visited a famous Zen master to inquire into the
meaning of Zen. The scholar asked question
after question but was so full of his own ideas
that he rarely gave the master an opportunity to
answer.
After about an hour of this one-sided dialogue,
the master asked the scholar if he wanted a cup
of tea. When the scholar held out his cup, the
master filled it but just kept on pouring.
“Enough,” the scholar cried out. “The cup is full.
It won’t hold any more.”
“Yes,” replied the master, “and so is your mind.
You can’t learn Zen until you empty your cup.”

honest with yourself is more important than pretending to have some motiva-
tion you don’t genuinely hold. Anyway, the more you meditate, the more you
open your heart and reveal your natural, inherent concern for the well-being
of others. The following sections cover the five basic motivational styles.
Check them out to get a sense of where you stand. Note that the boundaries
between these styles are fuzzy at best, and most people tend to be a blend of
a few or all five.

Chapter 4: Laying the Foundation: Motivation, Attitude, and Beginner’s Mind
Reflecting on your life
The great spiritual teachers and meditation
masters have always reminded us of the brevity
of life. The medieval Christian mystics kept a
skull on their desks to remind them of their own
mortality. And Buddhist monks and nuns in
some Asian countries still meditate in cemeter-
ies to deepen their awareness of imperma-
nence. Whether tomorrow, next year, or many
years from now, you and I will eventually die.
Remembering this from time to time can help us
to clarify life’s priorities — and remind us of our
reasons for meditating.
Of course, if you find it too depressing to think
about dying, by all means feel free to skip this
exercise. But you may discover that your initial
aversion fades as you open your heart to the
preciousness of life. Take ten minutes or more
to do this guided meditation (which is adapted
from the book A Path with Heart by Jack
Kornfield):
1. Sit quietly, close your eyes, and take a few
deep breaths, relaxing a little with each
exhalation.
2. Imagine that you’re at the end of your life
and death is quickly approaching.
Be aware of the tentativeness of life — you
could die at any moment.
3. Reflect on your life as you watch it replay
before your eyes like a video.
4. As you reflect, choose two things you’ve
done that you feel good about now.
They may not be important or life-changing;
in fact, they may be simple, seemingly
insignificant events.
5. Look deeply at what makes these moments
memorable — at the qualities of mind and
heart you brought to them.
6. Notice how these memories affect you —
what feelings and other memories they 
stir up.
7. In light of these memories, consider how
you might live differently if you had your
life to live again.
What activities would you give more time to
than you do now? What qualities of being
would you choose to emphasize? Which
people would you give more (or less) of your
attention to?
8. As you end this exercise and go about your
day, notice whether your attitude toward
your life has changed in any way.

Improving your life
Imagine for a moment that your life’s a mess and you’re struggling to get it
together — so you take up the practice of meditation. You figure meditation
will teach you the concentration and self-discipline you need to succeed. Or
maybe you have a difficult time in relationships, and you want to calm your
mind and even out the emotional rollercoaster so you’re not constantly in
conflict with others.
Perhaps you suffer from some chronic illness and hope that the regular prac-
tice of meditation will reduce your stress and improve your health in general.
Or maybe you just want to enhance your performance at work or in sports,
or learn how to take greater enjoyment from your family, friends, and leisure
activities.
Whatever the scenario, your primary concern at this level is to fix or improve
yourself and your external circumstances — a thoroughly noble intention.
Understanding and accepting yourself
At a certain point in your development, you may get tired of trying to fix
yourself — or perhaps you’ve done such a good job that it’s time to move on
to the next phase. Here you realize that some patterns  keep recurring and
66
Part I: Getting Acquainted 
Looking deeply into your own heart
Sit quietly, take a few deep breaths, and set
aside some time to inquire into your own heart
and mind for responses to these questions:
 What brings me to practice meditation?
 What motivates me to meditate?
 What do I hope to achieve?
 What do I expect to learn?
Set aside the first thoughts that come to mind,
look more deeply, and ask the question, “What is
the dissatisfaction or suffering that drives me?”
 Do I want to reduce stress and calm my
mind?
 Do I want to be happier and more accept-
ing of myself?
 Do I seek answers to the deeper, existential
questions like “Who am I?” or “What is the
meaning of life?”
Perhaps you’re even attuned to the suffering of
others and aspire to help them before helping
yourself. Or maybe you just want to improve
your performance at work or be more attentive
and loving to your family. Whatever responses
you get, just write them down without judgment,
refer to them as needed to help keep you moti-
vated, and allow them to change and deepen
over time.

struggling to change them just makes them more entrenched, and you decide
to shift from “fixing” to self-awareness and self-acceptance. As NBA coach
Phil Jackson puts it in his book Sacred Hoops, “If we can accept whatever
hand we’ve been dealt, no matter how unwelcome, the way to proceed even-
tually becomes clear.”
I like to compare change to one of those woven Chinese finger puzzles that were
popular when I was a kid: The harder you pull, the more stuck you get. But if
you move your fingers toward one another — the gesture of self-acceptance —
you can free them quite easily. If you’re tormented by self-blame, self-doubt, or
self-judgment, you may be drawn to meditation as a way of learning to accept
and even love yourself.
In my work as a psychotherapist, I’ve found that mean-spirited self-criticism
can wreak havoc in the psyches of otherwise well-balanced people — and the
antidote almost inevitably involves self-acceptance, what the Buddhists call
“making friends with yourself.” When you practice accepting yourself fully,
you soften and open your heart, not only to yourself, but ultimately to others
as well. (For more on self-acceptance, see Chapters 6, 10, and 11.)
Realizing your true nature
Although you recognize the value of improving or making friends with your-
self, you may be spurred to meditation by a desire to penetrate the veils that
separate you from the true source of all meaning, peace, and love. Nothing
less will satisfy you! Perhaps you’re obsessed with one of the great spiritual
questions, like “Who am I?” “What is God?” or “What is the meaning of life?”
In Zen, they say that such an intense yearning for truth is like a red-hot iron
ball lodged in the pit of your stomach — you can’t digest it, and you can’t
spit it out; you can only transform it through the power of your meditation.
Your quest may be motivated by personal suffering, but you’re unwilling to
stop at self-improvement or self-acceptance and feel impelled to reach the
summit of the mountain I describe in Chapter 1 — what the great masters call
enlightenment or satori. When you realize who you essentially are, the sepa-
rate self drops away and reveals your identity with being itself. This realiza-
tion, in turn, can have wide-reaching ramifications — including, ironically, a
happier and more harmonious life and complete self-love and self-acceptance.
Awakening others
The Tibetan Buddhists teach that all meditators must cultivate the most
important motivation of all — to see others as no different from oneself and
to put their liberation before one’s own. Known as bodhichitta (“awakened
heart”), this selfless aspiration actually accelerates the meditative process 
by offering an antidote to the natural human tendency to hoard our own
67
Chapter 4: Laying the Foundation: Motivation, Attitude, and Beginner’s Mind

accomplishments and insights and defend our own psychic and spiritual ter-
ritory. Unless it is suffused by bodhichitta, say the Tibetans, meditation can
take us only so far along the path to self-realization.
Expressing your innate perfection
In the Zen tradition, the highest motivation for meditating is not to attain
some special state of mind, but to express your innately pure and undefiled
“true nature” — what I referred to earlier as beginner’s mind, or in Chapter 1 as
pure being. With this motivation, you never leave your own hearth; instead,
you sit with the confidence that you already are the peace and happiness you
seek. This level of motivation requires tremendous spiritual maturity, but
when you’ve gotten a glimpse of who you really are, you may find yourself
moved to meditate in order to actualize and deepen your understanding.
How to Live in Harmony 
with Your Meditation
Now that you know what motivates you to meditate, you may benefit from a
few guidelines for enhancing and deepening your practice. In particular, med-
itators over the centuries have discovered that how you act, what you think
about, and which qualities you cultivate can have an immediate impact on
the depth and stability of your meditation.
Every spiritual tradition emphasizes right conduct of some kind — and not
necessarily on the basis of rigid notions of right and wrong. When your actions
don’t jibe with your reasons for meditating — for example, when you’re medi-
tating to reduce stress but your actions intensify conflict — your everyday life
may be working at cross-purposes with the time you spend on your cushion.
(The Hebrew word for sin originally meant “off the mark”!) The more you medi-
tate, the more sensitive you become to how some activities support or even
enhance your meditation — and others disturb or discourage it.
Of course, there is a never-ending feedback loop between formal meditation
and everyday life: How you live affects how you meditate, and how you medi-
tate affects how you live.
With these thoughts in mind, here are ten basic guidelines for living in har-
mony with the spirit of meditation:
 Be mindful of cause and effect. Notice how your actions — and the feel-
ings and thoughts that accompany them — influence others and your
own state of mind. When you flare up in anger or lash out in fear,
observe how the ripples can be felt for hours or even days — in the
68
Part I: Getting Acquainted 

responses of others, in your own body, and in your meditation. Do the
same with actions that express kindness or compassion. As the Bible
says, “As you sow, so shall you reap.”
 Reflect on impermanence and the preciousness of life. Death is real,
say the Tibetans; it can come without warning, and this body, too, will
one day be food for worms and other earthly creatures. By reflecting on
how rare it is to be a human being at a time when physical comforts are
relatively plentiful and the practice of meditation and other methods for
reducing stress and relieving suffering are so readily available, you may
feel more motivated to take advantage of the opportunities you have.
 Realize the limitations of worldly success. Check out the people you
know who have achieved the worldly success you aspire to. Are they
really any happier than you are? Do they have more love in their lives or
more peace of mind? Through meditation, you can achieve a level of inner
success that’s based on joy and tranquility rather than material gain.
 Practice nonattachment. This classic Buddhist counsel may seem on
first blush like an impossible task. But the point here is not to be indif-
ferent or to disengage from the world, but to notice how attachment to
the outcome of your actions affects your meditations — and your peace of
mind. What would it be like to act wholeheartedly, with the best of inten-
tions, and then let go of your struggle to get things to be a certain way?
 Cultivate patience and perseverance. If nothing else, the practice of
meditation requires the willingness to keep on keeping on — call it disci-
pline, diligence, perseverance, or just plain stick-to-itiveness, you’ll reap
the greatest benefits if you do it regularly, day after day. Besides, the
qualities of patience and perseverance translate nicely to every area of
life. (For more on effort and self-discipline, see Chapter 9.)
 Simplify your life. The busier and more complicated your life, the more
agitated your mind will be when you meditate — and the greater your
stress level. Pay particular attention to all those extra activities you tack
on to an already crammed schedule (perhaps to avoid taking a deep
breath, hearing your heartbeat, facing your fears, and dealing with other
unpleasant feelings like loneliness, emptiness, grief, or inadequacy). If
you stop running and listen closely, you may hear the voice of your own
inner wisdom.
 Live with honesty and integrity: When you lie, manipulate, and compro-
mise your core values, you may be able to hide from yourself for a time —
until you reach your meditation cushion. Then the proverbial you-know-
what hits the fan, and every peccadillo comes back to haunt you. Medita-
tion mirrors you back to you, and what you see may motivate you to actu-
alize more of your positive potential.
 Face situations with the courage of a warrior. Unlike their battlefield
counterparts, “meditation warriors” cultivate the courage to drop their
aggression and defensiveness, face their fears, and open their hearts —
to themselves and others. Easier said than done, you may say, but medi-
tation will teach you how — and then you need to be willing to follow

through in real-life situations. Ultimately, every moment becomes an
opportunity to practice. (For more on how to meditate in every moment
of life, see Chapter 15.)
 Trust the technology of meditation — and yourself. It helps to remem-
ber that people have been meditating successfully for thousands of
years — far longer than they’ve been using, say, laptop computers or the
Internet. Besides, we’re talking low-tech technology here, something
anyone can do — like breathing and paying attention. Just trust the tech-
nology, follow the instructions — and let go of the results.
 Dedicate your practice to the benefit of others. As I mention earlier, the
Tibetans call this dedication bodhichitta (“awakened heart”) and regard
it as essential for meditation that is life-changing, rather than merely
cosmetic. Studies of the impact of prayer on healing, cited in Healing
Words: The Power of Prayer and the Practice of Medicine by Larry Dossey,
MD, have shown that prayers that request specific results are not nearly
as effective as those that ask for the best for all concerned. In other
words, the love you take is equal to the love you make!

Looking for the last time
Imagine that you will never see your friends or
your loved ones again. Now, follow these steps:
1. Sit quietly, take a few deep breaths, and
close your eyes.
2. Let the usual thoughts, feelings, and preoc-
cupations that surround you disperse like
fog on a sunny morning.
3. Look at the objects and people in your field
of vision as though for the last time.
How do they appear to you? How do you
feel? What thoughts go through your mind?
4. Consider the beauty and preciousness of
this moment, which is the only one you
have.
5. Reflect on the recognition that every
moment is like this one.

or thousands of years, pundits and sages both East and West have been
telling us that our problems originate in our minds. So you won’t be sur-
prised if I join the chorus of voices and agree. Yes, they’re right: Your mind by
itself “can make a heaven of hell and a hell of heaven” (as English poet John
Milton put it). But how, you may be wondering, can this cute little truism help
you when you don’t know what to do about it? “Sure, my mind’s the prob-
lem,” you may say, “but I can’t exactly have it surgically removed.”
You can begin by becoming familiar with how your mind works. As you may
have noticed, it’s a rather complex assortment of thoughts, ideas, stories,
impulses, preferences, and emotions. Without a diagram, it can be as difficult
to negotiate as the jumble of wires and hoses under the hood of your car.
When you have a working knowledge of how your mind is structured, you can
begin to notice how those thoughts and feelings distort your experience and
keep you from achieving the happiness, relaxation, effectiveness, or healing
you seek. Then you can discover how meditation can teach you to change all
that by focusing and calming your mind, and ultimately by delving more
deeply and unraveling the habitual stories and patterns that keep causing
you suffering and stress. Who knows? You may not need to have a lobotomy
after all!

Taking a Tour of Your Inner Terrain
Because I’m an avid hiker and swimmer, I’m fond of using natural metaphors,
which actually lend themselves quite nicely to describing meditation. In
Chapter 1, I compare practicing meditation to climbing a mountain. Here I’ll
turn that metaphor on its head, so to speak, and have you imagine that the
journey you’re taking is down — to the bottom of a lake. (If you want to pic-
ture yourself in a wetsuit and scuba gear, go right ahead.) In fact, the lake I’m
referring to is you — you’re journeying to the depths of your own being.
Sifting through the layers 
of inner experience
When you meditate, in addition to developing your concentration and calm-
ing your mind, you may find yourself delving deeper into your inner experi-
ence and uncovering layers you didn’t even know existed. Now, what do you
suppose lies at the bottom? The great meditative traditions have different
names for it — essence, pure being, true nature, spirit, soul, the pearl of great
price, the source of all wisdom and love. The Zen folks call it your original
face before your parents were born. You might like to picture it as a spring
that gushes forth the pure, refreshing, deeply satisfying water of being with-
out reservation. (For more on this spring, see Chapter 1, where it awaits the
climber at the top of the mountain of meditation.)
72
Part I: Getting Acquainted 
Is it higher or deeper?
Spiritual teachers and personal growth advo-
cates have a dizzying fondness for up and down
metaphors. Some talk about digging down into
your inner experience like a miner, or having
profound insights, or feeling or knowing things
deeply. Others talk about higher consciousness
or transcending the mundane or having a mind
like the sky. (I make the best of both worlds by
using the two directions more or less inter-
changeably.)
To some degree, the difference lies in the 
personal preferences of the particular writer 
or teacher. But it can also refer to an attitude
toward inner experience: If you believe that the
wellspring of being lies deep inside you,
beneath the personal, then you talk about down.
If you believe that it exists in the upper echelons
of your being or comes down like grace or spirit
from above, then you talk about up.
In my humble opinion, if you dive deep enough,
you find yourself at the top of the mountain —
and if you rise high enough, you find yourself at
the bottom of the sea. In the end, it’s the same
place anyway. Ultimately, in fact, pure being has
no location — it’s everywhere in every one of us
all the time.

This wellspring of being is who you really are in your heart of hearts —
before you became conditioned to believe that you’re somehow deficient or
inadequate, as so many of us do. It’s your wholeness and completeness —
before you began to feel separate or lonely or fragmented. It’s the deep intu-
ition of being inextricably connected with something larger than yourself and
with every other being and thing. And it’s ultimately the source of all peace,
happiness, joy, and other positive, life-affirming feelings — even though you
may think they’re caused by outside circumstances. (Of course, people expe-
rience this source differently, which explains why there are so many words to
describe it.)
Connecting in some way with this source or spring of pure being is actually
the point of meditation, whether you’re aspiring to become enlightened or
just trying to reduce stress, enhance your performance, or improve your life.
And meditation will definitely take you there, as I explain later in this chapter.
But when you meditate, you also begin to encounter material that seems to
come between you and the experience of being, just as you may encounter
layers of sediment, algae, fish, and debris on your way to the bottom of a
lake. These layers don’t pose a problem unless the inner water is turbulent,
in which case they can make it difficult to see clearly. (By turbulence, I mean a
busy, agitated mind or a troubled, frightened, defended heart.)
In more or less the order in which you may encounter them in meditation, I
cover these layers in the following sections.
Mind chatter
When you turn your attention inward, the first thing you’re likely to
encounter is the ceaseless chattering of your mind. The Buddhists like to
compare the mind to a noisy monkey that swings uncontrollably from
thought-branch to thought-branch without ever settling down.
Most of the time, you may be so caught up in this chatter that you’re not
even aware it’s happening. It may take the form of reliving the past or
rehearsing for the future or trying to solve some problem in the present.
Whatever the content, your mind is constantly talking to itself, often spinning
a story with you as the hero — or the victim. (Research indicates that a very
small percentage of people experience no inner dialogue at all but have only
images or feelings instead.)
Intense or recurring emotions
Just as an action film or a romantic comedy takes you on a rollercoaster ride of
emotions, so the dramas your mind keeps spinning out evoke their own play of
feelings. If you’re trying to figure out how to make a killing in the stock market,
for example, or ask out that attractive man or woman you just met at work, you
may feel fear or anxiety or possibly excitement or lust. If you’re obsessing about
the injustices or unkindnesses you suffered recently, you may experience sad-
ness, grief, outrage, or resentment. Together with these emotions, of course, go a
73
Chapter 5: How Your Mind Stresses You Out and What You Can Do about It

range of bodily sensations, including tension, arousal, contraction in the heart, or
waves of energy in the belly or the back of the head.
Some of these feelings may be pleasurable, others unpleasant or even painful.
But emotions in themselves don’t pose a problem. It’s just that as long as you
keep reacting to the dramas inside your head, you may be cutting yourself off
from others and from deeper, more satisfying dimensions of your being —
and you may miss what’s really going on around you as well. (For more on
working with emotions in meditation, see Chapter 11.)
Grasping and pushing away
At a somewhat subtler level of experience than thoughts and emotions lurks
a perpetual play of like and dislike, attachment and aversion. The Buddhists
teach that the key to happiness and contentment lies in wanting what you
74

How to tell the difference between 
thoughts and feelings
In my work as a psychotherapist, I’ve found that
many people have trouble distinguishing
between thoughts and feelings. For example, if
I ask “What are you feeling?” they may reply, “I
feel like I shouldn’t be so open with my partner
anymore.” Even though this insight begins with
the right word, it’s actually a judgment, rather
than a feeling.
Here are a few pointers for telling the difference:
 Feelings occur as a set of recognizable
sensations in your body. When you’re
angry, for example, you may feel tension in
your shoulders and jaw and experience a
rush of energy in the back of your head.
When you’re sad, by contrast, you may feel
a heaviness in your chest and heart and a
congested feeling in your sinuses and
throat. Through meditation, you can dis-
cover how to experience your feelings
directly as sensations, separate from the
thoughts and stories that perpetuate them.
(For more on meditating with thoughts and
feelings, see Chapter 11.)
 Thoughts are the images, memories,
beliefs, judgments, and reflections that
float through your mind and often give rise
to your feelings. If you follow the word feel
with the word like, you’re probably voicing a
thought or a belief, rather than a feeling. You
can practice breaking strong feelings down
into their component parts by asking: What
are the thoughts and images in my mind that
keep me feeling the way I do? And what am
I actually experiencing in my body right
now, aside from my thoughts?
Thoughts not only generate feelings, they
often masquerade as feelings (so you won’t
actually feel the ones you have), attempt to
talk you out of your feelings, judge your feel-
ings, or suppress them entirely. The more
you can disentangle your thoughts and feel-
ings, the more clearly and consciously you
can relate with (and express) your inner
experience.

have and not wanting what you don’t have. But often, we’re somehow dissat-
isfied with what we have, while we yearn for what we don’t have and struggle
to get it. Or we may become deeply attached to what we have and then suffer
when time and circumstances change it or take it away. Because change is
unavoidable, this tendency to either hold on tight to our experience or push
it away can actually cause constant suffering.
Negative beliefs and life scripts
Here’s another nature metaphor for you: Imagine that your thoughts and
emotions and even the dramas that keep running through your brain form
the leaves and branches of some inner, subterranean bush or tree. (Think
wild and uncontrollable here, like blackberries or bamboo.) What do you sup-
pose constitutes the root, from which the leaves and branches relentlessly
spring?
Well, you may be surprised to discover that the root is a cluster of beliefs 
and stories, many of them negative, that have formed as the result of what
people — especially people who are significant in your life, like loved ones
and friends — have done to you and told you over the years. These beliefs
and stories have intertwined over your lifetime into a kind of life script that
defines who you think you are and how you view the people and circum-
stances around you. (I say “surprised” because most of us are clueless when
it comes to life scripts — although you may have noticed some resemblance
between your life and, say, Survivor, As the World Turns, or The Simpsons.)
The point is this: Your tendency to identify with your life script actually limits
your range of possibilities and causes you suffering by acting as a filter
through which you interpret your life in negative ways. To return to the bush
metaphor, you can keep pruning back the branches, but you’ll keep living out
the same old story until you pull it up by the roots.
The sense of separation
Even deeper than your stories — some would say the soil in which the sto-
ries grow — lies a feeling of being cut off or separate from life or being itself.
Although the meditative traditions teach that separation is actually an illu-
sion and we’re inextricably connected to one another, the sense of being sep-
arate runs deep indeed. Often it dates back to early childhood experiences,
when you were forced by circumstances to separate prematurely from your
mother or some other nurturing figure. Sometimes it can be traced to the
birth trauma itself, when you had to exchange your placental paradise for a
colder, harsher reality. (Or maybe, as some traditions contend, it comes pack-
aged with the embryonic hardware.)
Whatever its origins, this feeling of separation may give rise to a kind of pri-
mordial fear: If I’m separate, then I must end at my skin, and everything out
there must be other. Because these others are often bigger than I am and I
have only the most limited control over their actions, my survival must be at
stake — and I need to protect myself at all costs.
75
Chapter 5: How Your Mind Stresses You Out and What You Can Do about It

Life scripts evolve as strategies for surviving in a world of apparent separa-
tion, in which others are perceived as potentially unfriendly, withholding,
demanding, or rejecting.
Discovering how turbulence 
clouds your mind and heart
Needless to say, when you’re experiencing inner turbulence, you may find it
difficult to connect with being when you sit down to meditate. Sometimes, of
course, you may have moments when your mind just settles by itself and you
can see all the way down to the bottom of the lake. (To use another nature
metaphor, think of those overcast days when the cloud cover suddenly parts
and the sun shines through with all its warmth and radiance.) These
moments may be marked by feelings of inner peace and tranquility, upsurges
of love and joy, or intimations of your oneness with life. But most of the time,
you may feel like you’re doing a breaststroke through muddy water.
Well, the turbulence and confusion you encounter when you meditate doesn’t
suddenly materialize on cue. It’s there all along, clouding your mind and
heart and acting as a filter that obscures your clear seeing. You may experi-
ence it as an inner claustrophobia or density — you’re so full of your own
emotions and opinions that you have no room for the ideas and feelings of
others, or even for any new or unfamiliar ideas and feelings that may well up
inside you. Or you may get so caught up in your drama that you’re not even
aware that you’re filtering your experience.
76
Part I: Getting Acquainted 
Becoming aware of your inner dialogue
Begin this meditation by paying attention to your
thoughts. After several minutes, notice what the
voices inside your head are telling you. (If you’re
not aware of any voices, you may want to
observe feelings or images instead.) Does one
voice predominate, or do several voices vie for
your attention? Do they criticize or encourage
you? Shame or praise you? Or do they focus pri-
marily on the other people in your life? Do any
of the voices argue with one another?
What kind of emotional tone do these voices
have? Are they loving and gentle or angry and
impatient? Does one voice sound more like you
than the others? Do any of them remind you of
people in your life — past or present? How do
these voices make you feel?
Allow ten minutes for this exercise initially.
When you have the knack of it, you can stop
from time to time during the day and pay atten-
tion to your inner dialogue. The important point
is, you’re not your thoughts — and you don’t
necessarily have to believe the messages they
impart. (See the sidebar “You are not your
thoughts and feelings” later in this chapter.)

For example, I have a friend, a computer programmer, who received plenty of
love and support as a child. Now, as an adult, he thinks of himself as inher-
ently competent and worthy, even though he’s no Steve Jobs. As a result, he
enjoys his career, experiences only minimal anxiety when he makes work-
related decisions, sees others as inherently supportive, and exudes a palpa-
ble self-confidence that draws others to him and invites them to trust him.
By contrast, I have another friend, an independent entrepreneur, who has
several advanced degrees and has taken countless work-related trainings but
who believes deep down that he’s inherently unworthy. No matter how hard
he works, he can’t seem to get ahead. Besides, he doesn’t really enjoy his
work because he’s constantly anxious that he may fail, and he imagines that
others are conspiring to undermine or discredit him.
In each case, the way my friend views himself and interprets what’s going on
around him determines whether he’s happy or stressed out.
As these examples indicate, it’s the inner turbulence and confusion 
through which you filter and distort your experiences — not the experiences
themselves — that causes most of your suffering and stress. The good news
is that meditation can teach you how to calm the troubled waters of your mind
and heart, turn some of your inner claustrophobia into inner spaciousness,
and find your way past your filters (or avoid them altogether) so you can
experience life more directly — and reduce your stress in the process. But
before I describe how meditation delivers these goodies, let me explain in
some detail (in “The Bad News: How Your Mind Stresses You Out”) how suf-
fering and stress occur in the first place.
The Bad News: How Your Mind 
Stresses You Out
Recently a friend of mine in her mid-30s decided to ask for a raise. Even
though she’d worked with the company as a graphic designer for years and
was long overdue for a pay increase, she was overcome with self-doubt.
Every day as she drove to work, she would agonize and obsess as conflicting
voices and feelings battled it out inside her.
In particular, she kept rehearsing her upcoming conversation with her boss
and reviewing all the things she’d done to make her worthy of more money —
the projects she’d completed, the successful ads and brochures she’d
designed. Sometimes she would emerge from these imaginary conversations
feeling triumphant; other times she would emerge crestfallen and defeated.
As she listened to all this mind chatter, her feelings fluctuated wildly, from
excited and confident to afraid and uncertain.
77
Chapter 5: How Your Mind Stresses You Out and What You Can Do about It

At times, she could hear a barely audible voice (sounding suspiciously like
her father’s) arguing that given her overall ineptitude, she didn’t deserve a
raise and that she was lucky to have a job at all. In response, she would feel
ashamed and hopeless.
Next, an angry, vindictive voice would step in, arguing that her boss was an
ungrateful autocrat and she should barge into his office and put him in his
place. Then a confident, affirmative voice would remind her how much she
had contributed at work and what a fine person she was overall. Finally, a
voice that sounded a lot like her mother’s would counsel her to stay calm and
unruffled and be thankful for whatever crumbs life sent her way.
After nearly a week of intense inner struggle and stress, during which she had
difficulty sleeping and could barely function at work, my friend finally made
an appointment with her boss. Filled with conflicting emotions, she entered
his office — and was immediately offered a raise even larger than the one she
had planned to request! As it turned out, all the images, emotions, and ideas
her mind and body had churned out over the days leading up to the meeting
had no connection with what ultimately happened.

You are not your thoughts or feelings
Find a quiet spot where you can sit for the next
ten minutes. When you’re comfortably settled,
do the following:
1. Take a few slow, deep breaths.
2. Turn your attention to your thoughts. (If you
tend to be an emotional person, you can do
the same exercise with your emotions.)
Instead of getting caught up in your
thoughts (or emotions) as you might usually
do, watch them closely, the way an angler
watches the tip of a rod or a tennis player
watches a ball. If you find your attention
wandering, come back to the task at hand.
At first, your mind may seem like wall-to-
wall thoughts or emotions, and you may have
difficulty determining where one thought
leaves off and the next one begins. You may
also find that certain thoughts or emotions
keep recurring like popular tunes — for
example, repetitive worries or favorite
images or fantasies. If you’re especially
attentive, you may begin to notice that each
thought or emotion has a beginning, a
middle, and an end.
3. At the end of the ten minutes, stop and
reflect on your experience.
Did you experience some distance from
your thoughts or emotions? Or did you keep
losing yourself in the thinking or feeling
process?
The point of this exercise is not to see how well
you can track your thinking or feeling, but to
give you the experience of being the observer
of your thoughts. Believe it or not, you’re the
thinker not the thoughts! As you begin to gain
some perspective on your thoughts through the
practice of meditation, you may find that your
thoughts start losing the power they once had
over you. You can have your thoughts, but they
won’t have you.

Does any of this sound familiar? Like my friend — indeed, like just about
everyone I know, including me! — you may spend much of your time
engrossed in the captivating but ultimately illusory scenarios fabricated in
the original “fantasy factory” (the one that predates Disney and Lucasfilm) —
that is, the neocortex.
One moment you may be worrying about the future — how am I going to
make enough money, orchestrate a great vacation, impress my lover, amuse
my kids — and you’re lost in a reverie filled with hope and fear. The next
moment, you may be obsessed with the past — why didn’t I tell the truth,
take that job, accept that proposal — and you’re overcome with regret and
self-recrimination.
And like my friend, you may have noticed, much to your chagrin, that you
have remarkably little control over the worrying, fantasizing, and obsessing
79
Chapter 5: How Your Mind Stresses You Out and What You Can Do about It
Thinking and feeling with a meditator’s mind
In case you’re worrying that meditation may
stop you from thinking and feeling, here are a
few helpful distinctions I picked up from one of
my teachers, Jean Klein, author of Who Am I?
and The Ease of Being.
Jean likes to distinguish between ordinary
thought and creative thought; functional thought
and psychological memory; and emotivity and
emotion. (Although he teaches a direct approach
to spiritual truth through self-inquiry rather than
meditation, I’ve taken the liberty of applying his
insights because I believe they’re also relevant
to the practice of meditation.)
 Ordinary thought versus creative thought:
When your mind keeps churning out an
endless series of thoughts linked together
like boxcars on a train, with no spaces
between them, you’re trapped by your own
claustrophobic thinking process and don’t
have any room for fresh, original thinking or
problem solving. But when your mind is
completely open and unfurnished, as Jean
likes to say — a state of mind you can cul-
tivate in meditation — you have plenty of
inner space for creative thoughts to bubble
up from their source in pure being. Unlike
ordinary thoughts, these thoughts are com-
pletely appropriate to the situation at hand.
 Psychological memory versus functional
thinking: The more you meditate, the more
you free your mind of psychological
memory, which is the turbulent, obsessive,
self-centered kind of thinking that’s gener-
ated by your stories and centers on the sep-
arate, fragmented person you imagine
yourself to be. Instead, your thoughts
become primarily functional, arising in
response to circumstances and then stop-
ping when they’re no longer required.
 Emotivity versus emotion: Likewise, the
powerful, disturbing emotions that some-
times seem to run your life — which Jean
Klein calls emotivity — are actually rooted in
your stories, not in reality, and have little in
common with true emotion. Subtler than
emotivity and rooted in love, true emotion
arises naturally from being itself in response
to situations where the illusory sense of sep-
aration has been diminished or dissolved
through the practice of meditation — or
some other spiritual practice like self-inquiry.

your mind generates. Instead of having thoughts and feelings, it may often
seem that the thoughts and feelings are having you!
The reason these thoughts and feelings seem uncontrollable is that they
spring from a deeper story or life script that may be largely unconscious. For
example, you may hold the subliminal notion that nothing you do is quite
good enough, so you push yourself anxiously to make up for your shortcom-
ings. Or, quite the contrary, you may believe that you deserve more than
you’re getting, so you’re unhappy with what you have. Perhaps you believe
that you’re inherently unattractive, so no matter how much you compensate,
you feel embarrassed and uncomfortable around the opposite sex. Or maybe
you see intimate relationships as inherently threatening, so you do all you
can to avoid being vulnerable.
Your inner story or drama has a powerful momentum that carries you along,
whether you’re aware of it or not. Sometimes it may seem like a tragedy, com-
plete with villains and victims. At other times, it may seem more like a
comedy, a romance, a fantasy, or a boring documentary. The point is, you’re
the center around which this drama revolves, and you’re often so enthralled
by the scenery that you can’t really see what’s going on outside, in the real
world around you.
As a result, you may be constantly acting and reacting excessively and inap-
propriately, based not on the actual circumstances but on the distorted pic-
tures inside your brain. (If you’re like me, you’ve no doubt had moments
when you suddenly woke up, as though from a dream, and realized that you
had no idea what the person you were interacting with really meant or felt.)
Besides, you risk missing entirely the beauty and immediacy of the present
moment as it unfolds.
As I mentioned earlier, it’s this inner drama that causes most of your suffering
and stress, not the experiences themselves. Not that life doesn’t serve you up
your share of difficult times and painful situations or that the homeless in
American cities or the starving children in Bosnia don’t really suffer. But the
mind often adds an extra layer of unnecessary suffering to the undeniable
hardships of life by interpreting experience in negative or limited ways. (See
the sidebar “Distinguishing between suffering, pain, and stress” later in this
chapter.) The following sections highlight some of the major ways your mind
stresses you out.
Preoccupation with past and future
Like most minds, yours may flit from past to future and back again — and
only occasionally come to rest in the present. When you’re preoccupied with
what may happen next month or next year, you churn up a range of stressful
emotions based on hope, fear, and anticipation that have nothing to do with
what’s happening right now. And when you’re reliving the past — which after
80
Part I: Getting Acquainted 

all has no existence except as thoughts and images inside your brain — you
may bounce from regret to resentment to sadness and grief.
By contrast, when you meditate, you practice bringing your mind back again
and again to the present moment, where, as the Persian poet Rumi says, “the
only news is that there’s no news at all.” By returning to the simplicity of the
here and now, you can take refuge from the stressful scenarios of your mind.
(See the section “Returning to the present moment” later in this chapter.)
Resistance to the way things are
Most of us struggle unhappily to get what we believe we need in order to be
happy, while ignoring or actively disliking what we already have. Now, don’t
get me wrong; I’m not suggesting that you just sit back passively and do noth-
ing to improve your life. But as one of my teachers used to say, the secret to
improving your life is first to accept things just the way they are — which is
precisely what the practice of meditation can teach. In particular, resistance
to the way things are usually comes in one of two flavors: resistance to
change and resistance to pain.
Resistance to change
Like it or not, constant change is unavoidable. If you try to resist the current
of change by holding on to some image of how things are supposed to be,
you’re going to suffer because you can’t possibly get life to hold still and con-
form. As the Greek philosopher Heraclitus used to say, “You can’t step into
the same river twice.”
81
Chapter 5: How Your Mind Stresses You Out and What You Can Do about It
Hearts and minds
When I talk about how the “mind” causes suf-
fering and stress, I’m using the term generically
to include emotions as well as thoughts, because
the two are inseparable. Certain Eastern lan-
guages, such as Chinese and Sanskrit, even use
the same word to refer to both mind and heart,
and many Eastern sages teach that the mind
actually resides in the heart center.
When you have a thought about potentially
charged situations such as relationships, work,
financial problems, or life transitions, you almost
invariably have an emotional response — 
subliminal though it may be. In fact, the field 
of mind-body medicine has corroborated the
view that the mind and body can’t really be 
separated — thoughts give rise to chemical
changes in the blood that affect metabolism and
immunity, and alterations in blood chemistry,
through drugs or environmental toxins or stres-
sors, can change how you think and feel.
Similarly, the stories that run your life consist of
complex layers of emotions, beliefs, and physi-
cal contraction that can’t easily be teased apart.
Through the practice of meditation, you can
begin to peel back these layers, infuse them
with awareness, and gain insight into the pat-
terns that hold them together.

Through meditation, you can discover how to flow with the current by devel-
oping an open, flexible, accepting mind. In fact, meditation provides the per-
fect laboratory for studying change because you get to sit quietly and notice
the thoughts and feelings and sensations coming and going. Or you can
stiffen up and resist and make the process more painful. Did you ever notice
how some people become more crotchety and depressed as they age, while
others age gracefully and with a joyful twinkle in their eyes? The difference
lies in their ability to adapt to the challenging changes life brings their way.
Resistance to pain
Like change, pain is inevitable — but so, of course, is pleasure. In fact, you
can’t have one without the other, though most of us would love to have it
some other way. When you tighten your belly and hold your breath against
the onslaught of pain, be it emotional or physical, you actually intensify the
pain. And when you affix a story to the pain — for example, “This shouldn’t
be happening to me,” or “I must have done something to deserve this” — you
just Velcro an extra layer of suffering on top of the pain, which causes your
body to tighten and resist even more and only serves to perpetuate the pain
rather than relieve it.
Through meditation, you can learn to breathe deeply, soften your belly, cut
through your story, and relax around your pain. (To discover how to soften
your belly, see Chapter 10.) Often, the pain will naturally let go and release —
and even when it doesn’t, it generally becomes much easier to bear.
Judging and comparing mind
The tendency of your mind to compare you to others (or to some impossible
ideal) and to judge every little thing you do as imperfect or inadequate just
keeps you anxious, frustrated, and upset. Generally, this tendency originates
in your stories or life script, a deeply held cluster of often negative beliefs.
(See the “Negative beliefs and life scripts” section, earlier in this chapter.)
After all, if you believe that you’re lovable and inherently perfect just the way
you are, your mind has nothing to compare you with. When you practice
meditation, you can develop the capacity to observe the judgments and com-
parisons of your mind without identifying with them or mistaking them for
truth. (For more on this capacity, see the “Penetrating your experience with
insight” section, later in this chapter.)
Learned helplessness and pessimism
As numerous psychological studies suggest, your ability to deal with stressful
situations largely depends on whether you believe you have the resources
necessary to cope. That’s right — the belief that you have what it takes is
82
Part I: Getting Acquainted 

perhaps your greatest resource. If your story keeps telling you that you’re
inadequate, it’s just making stressful situations more stressful.
Meditation can teach you coping skills such as focusing and calming your
mind; returning to the present moment; and cultivating positive emotions and
mind-states that help you avoid negative, distracting thoughts and empower
you to deal with difficult circumstances and people. (Refer to the section “The
Good News: How Meditation Relieves Stress” later in this chapter.) Ultimately,
you can discover how to see beyond your story and make direct contact with
the true source of optimism and joy, the wellspring of pure being inside you.
Overwhelming emotions
Although you can’t necessarily identify your story, you may be painfully
aware of how powerful emotions like anger, fear, longing, grief, jealousy, and
desire cloud your mind, torment your heart, and cause you to act in ways
you later regret. Initially, meditation won’t get rid of these emotions, but it
will teach you how to focus and calm your mind and prevent them from dis-
tracting you. If you want, you can then use meditation to help you observe
these emotions as they arise without avoiding or suppressing them. Over
time, you can develop penetrating insight into the nature of these emotions
and their connection to the underlying stories that keep generating them —
and ultimately you can investigate these stories and even dismantle them
entirely. (For more on meditating with challenging emotions, see Chapter 11.)
Fixation of attention
The tendency of the thinking mind to obsess or fixate on certain thoughts
and emotions causes the body to contract in response. Have you ever
noticed how tense and anxious you can get when you mentally rehearse the
same scenario again and again, even when it’s an ostensibly positive one? By
contrast, an alert, open, fluid mind — which you can develop through the reg-
ular practice of mindfulness meditation (see Chapter 6) — allows you to flow
from experience to experience without getting fixated or stuck. Ultimately,
you can practice receptive awareness (see Chapter 1), the spacious, skylike
quality of mind that welcomes whatever arises.
Clinging to a separate self
The great meditative traditions teach that the root cause of suffering and
stress, which gives rise to your stories, is the belief that you’re inherently
separate — from others, from the rest of life, and from being itself. Because
you feel separate and alone, you need to protect yourself and ensure your
survival at all costs. But you have only limited power, and you’re surrounded
83
Chapter 5: How Your Mind Stresses You Out and What You Can Do about It

by forces beyond your control. As long as you keep struggling to defend your
turf, you’re going to keep suffering, no matter how hard you try. Meditation
offers you the opportunity to relax your guard, open your awareness, and
ultimately catch a glimpse of who you really are, beyond your stories and the
illusion of a separate, isolated self.

Distinguishing between suffering, pain, and stress
Yikes! Who wants to burden their brain with
such an unappetizing topic? Yet, the clearer 
you are about suffering and stress, the more
easily you can minimize their impact on your life.
With this in mind, you may want to consider the
following helpful (and admittedly unofficial) 
distinctions:
 Pain consists of direct, visceral experi-
ences with a minimum of conceptual over-
lays. Your best friend says something mean
to you, and you feel a painful constriction in
your heart. You hit your thumb with a
hammer, and it aches and throbs. You get
the flu, and your head feels like someone’s
squeezing it in a vice. Pain hurts, pure and
simple.
 Suffering, by contrast, is what happens
when your mind makes hay with your pain.
For example, you decide that because she
hurt your feelings, she must secretly hate
you, which means that there’s something
terribly wrong with you . . . and the next
thing you know, you’re feeling depressed 
as well as hurt. Or you turn your headache
into a sure warning sign of some serious ill-
ness, which just heaps a big dose of fear
and hopelessness onto an already difficult
situation. Suffering, in other words, results
from seeing situations through the distort-
ing lens of the story your mind tells you.
 The stress response is a physiological
mechanism for adapting to challenging
physical or psychological circumstances.
Certain physical stressors, such as extraor-
dinary heat or cold, an extremely loud noise,
or a violent attack, will be stressful no
matter how your mind interprets them. But
the stressful effect of most stressors
depends on the spin your mind adds to the
situation. For example, driving to work in
heavy traffic, sitting at your desk for eight
hours handling paperwork and phone calls,
and then driving home may be only mildly
stressful on a purely physical level —
believe it or not. But when you are afraid of
arriving late, have a conflicted relationship
with your boss, feel angry at several of your
clients or coworkers, and are still mulling
over the argument you had with your
spouse or best friend, no wonder you crawl
home at the end of the day completely
exhausted. Just as your mind can transform
pain into suffering, so it can parlay ordinary
stressors into extraordinary stress.

you really are — but it’s not. Your essential being remains pure and unharmed,
no matter how elaborate and compelling your story becomes. Besides, as
stubborn and intractable as they may seem, your mind and heart are actually
malleable. Through the regular practice of meditation, you can reduce your
suffering and stress by stilling and ultimately dissipating the turbulence and
confusion inside you. As one ancient Zen master put it, “If your mind isn’t
clouded by unnecessary things, this moment is the best moment of your life.”
To begin with, you can develop the skill of focusing and concentrating your
mind, which calms it and prevents it from becoming agitated. As your concen-
tration deepens, thoughts and feelings that have been building up inside natu-
rally bubble up and evaporate — a process I like to call spontaneous release.
When you’ve developed strong concentration, you can expand your aware-
ness to include thoughts, feelings, and the deeper patterns and stories that
underlie them. Then, through the power of penetrating insight, you can
explore the various layers of inner experience, get to know how they func-
tion, and ultimately use this understanding to dismantle the patterns that
keep causing you stress.
Developing focus and concentration
So your mind chatters constantly, swirling you up and stressing you out, and
you’re wondering what you can do to quiet it down. Well, you can begin by
practicing a meditation technique that emphasizes concentration, such as
following or counting your breaths (see Chapter 6) or reciting a mantra (see
Chapter 3). When you get the knack, you can keep shifting from your inner
dialogue to the present moment, wherever you happen to be. And if you’re so
inclined, you can develop positive qualities that counteract some of the nega-
tive tendencies of your mind and heart.
Stabilizing your concentration
If you’ve ever tried to quiet your mind by preventing it from thinking, you
know how hopeless that can be. (See the sidebar “Stopping your mind,” later
in this chapter.) But the more you invest your mental energy in a single focus
during meditation, the more one-pointed your mind becomes, and the more
the distractions recede to the background. Eventually, you can develop the
ability to stabilize your concentration on a single focus for minutes at a time,
gently returning when your mind wanders off.
With increased one-pointedness comes an experience of inner harmony and
stillness, as the sediment in the turbulent lake of your mind gradually settles,
leaving the water clean and clear. This experience is generally accompanied
by feelings of calm and relaxation — and occasionally by other pleasurable
feelings like love, joy, happiness, and bliss (which incidentally originate at the
bottom of the lake, in pure being).
85
Chapter 5: How Your Mind Stresses You Out and What You Can Do about It

At deeper levels of concentration, you may experience total absorption in the
object — a state known as samadhi. When this power of focused concentra-
tion is directed like a laser beam to everyday activities, you can enter what
psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi calls flow — a state of supreme enjoy-
ment in which time stops, self-consciousness drops away, and you become
one with the activity itself.
Returning to the present moment
When you’ve begun to develop your concentration, you can use it to keep
shifting in everyday life away from your inner drama and back to the present
moment. You may not eliminate the turbulence, but you can keep seeing
beyond it. It’s kind of like taking off your sunglasses and looking at things
directly — or like opening your eyes wide when you start falling asleep. The
more you look past the drama, the more you see the freshness of being itself
reflected in what you see. Returning to the present moment again and again
forges a trail that allows you to do an end run around your drama and
strengthens your direct connection with life. (For more on returning to the
present moment, see Chapters 6 and 15.)
Cultivating positive emotions and mind-states
You can also use the concentration you develop to cultivate positive alterna-
tives to agitation, fear, anger, depression, and the other powerful emotions
that arise when you’re involved in your story. (In fact, the practice of cultiva-
tion itself can develop your powers of concentration.) These positive mind-
states include lovingkindness, compassion, equanimity, and joy. (For more on
cultivating positive emotions, see Chapter 10.)
Allowing spontaneous release
When you meditate regularly, you start to notice that thoughts and feelings
that have accumulated inside you naturally dissipate like mist rising from the
surface of a lake. You don’t have to do anything special to make this happen —
it just occurs naturally as your concentration deepens and your mind settles
down. You may sit to meditate feeling weighted down by worries or concerns
and then get up half an hour later feeling somehow lighter, more spacious, and
more worry-free. Who knows how this mysterious process happens? You might
say that meditating is like lifting the lid on a boiling pot of soup — you create
space for the water to evaporate and relieve the pressure that has been build-
ing up inside.
86
Part I: Getting Acquainted 

To encourage this process of spontaneous release, you can practice medita-
tion techniques that involve receptive awareness — open, spacious awareness
that welcomes whatever arises. (You’ll need to develop your concentration
first.) When your mind’s not fixated on a particular object — be it a thought, a
memory, or an emotion — but expansive and unattached like the sky, you’re
no longer investing energy in your drama, but rather inviting whatever’s
churning inside you to unfold and let go.
Penetrating your experience with insight
In the previous sections, I highlight concentration and awareness techniques
that show you how to circumvent your drama, develop alternatives to your
drama, or still your mind so that your drama doesn’t disturb you. The prob-
lem is, these techniques still leave your inner stories more or less intact, and
when your concentration weakens or your lovingkindness wanes, the same
old distracting thoughts and troubling emotions come back to stress you out!
Through the practice of penetrating insight, you can get to know your drama,
gain an understanding of how it causes suffering, see beyond it — and even-
tually free yourself from it entirely.
Becoming aware of your inner experience
When you sit quietly for 10 or 15 minutes and notice your thoughts and feel-
ings, you’re making a radical shift in your relationship to your inner experi-
ence. (For more on observing thoughts and feelings, see Chapter 11.) Instead of
being swept away by the current, you become, for the moment, an observer on
the shore, watching the river of your experience flow by. Though the difference
may seem inconsequential and you may not feel that you’re making any head-
way, you’ve actually begun to loosen your story’s stranglehold on your life.
Gradually, you begin to notice spaces in your mind’s chatter, and what once
seemed so serious and solid slowly becomes lighter and infused with fresh air.
You may find yourself laughing at your tendency to worry and obsess, or per-
haps you pause and notice what you’re feeling before you react.
As you practice welcoming your experience just as it is, including your judg-
ments and self-criticisms, you may also discover that your attitude toward
yourself begins to change in subtle ways. Instead of impatience or contempt,
you may begin to notice a certain self-acceptance creeping in as you become
more familiar with the repetitive patterns of your mind. Hey, you may even
develop a measure of compassion for yourself as you see how self-critical or
distracted or frightened you can become.
87
Chapter 5: How Your Mind Stresses You Out and What You Can Do about It

Becoming aware of your story and how it confuses you
When you meditate regularly and observe your thoughts and feelings, you
begin to notice recurring themes and story lines that keep playing in your
mind. Perhaps you become aware of the tendency to obsess about all the
times people misunderstood you or failed to give you the love you wanted.
Maybe you watch yourself comparing yourself to other people and judging
yourself better — or worse. Possibly you find yourself fantasizing about the
ideal mate, even though you’ve been happily married for years. Or you may
notice that you’re constantly planning for the future while ignoring what’s
happening right here and now.
Whatever your particular patterns may be, you can observe how they keep
arising to disturb you and pull you away from the reality at hand — which
may be some simple task, like following your breath or reciting your mantra.
Gradually, you realize that your story is just that — a story your mind keeps
spinning that separates you from others and causes you pain. As John Lennon
put it, “Life is what’s happening while you’re busy making other plans.” When
you start seeing your story for what it is, you don’t allow it to confuse you in
the same way anymore.
Changing your story
As you may notice after you meditate for a while, just being aware of your
story can begin changing it in subtle (or even not-so-subtle!) ways. When you
develop a certain distance from your story — knowing at some level that it’s
just your story, not who you really are — you naturally become less reactive,
people respond to you differently, and circumstances shift accordingly. Soon
your life is just not the same old story anymore!
Of course, you may already be struggling to change your life by manipulating
circumstances or reprogramming your mind with affirmations or positive

Put the story down and move on
Two Zen monks were walking along a country
road when they came to a stream swollen to a
raging torrent by the heavy spring rains. There
they found an attractive young woman waiting
on the shore, unable to cross.
One of the monks approached the woman and
offered to help her. With her consent, he lifted
her in his arms and carried her across the
stream. Then the two monks continued on their
way in silence.
When they got back to the monastery, the monk
who had watched his friend carry the woman
could not contain himself any longer. “You know
we’re not supposed to have any contact with
females, especially attractive ones. How could
you possibly do that?”
“Ah,” said the other monk, “I put the woman
down hours ago, but you’re still carrying her
with you.”

thinking. But first you have to bring the power of penetrating insight to bear
on your habitual patterns and stories; otherwise, healthier perspectives and
patterns can’t take root, and you just keep running in the same old grooves.
Seeing beyond your story to who you really are
Even though you may become aware of your story, gain some distance from it,
and begin to alter it in certain fundamental ways, you may still identify with it
until you can catch a glimpse of who you really are, beyond your story.
Such glimpses can take a number of different forms. Perhaps you have unex-
pected moments of peace or tranquility, when your thoughts settle down — or
even stop entirely — and a sweet silence permeates your mind. Or you may
experience a flood of unconditional love that momentarily opens your heart
wide and gives you a brief glimpse of the oneness beyond all apparent separa-
tion. Or maybe you have a sudden intuition of your inherent interconnected-
ness with all beings or a sense of being in the presence of something far vaster
than yourself. Whatever the insight that lifts you beyond your story, it can
irrevocably alter who you take yourself to be. Never again can you fully believe
that you’re merely the limited personality your mind insists you are.
I can still remember how fresh and clear everything appeared after my first
meditation retreat — the colors so vivid, people’s faces so radiant — even
though I’d spent five days doing nothing but struggling to count my breaths
from one to ten without losing my way. I felt as though a bandage had been
ripped from my eyes and I could see things clearly for the first time. Everything
I encountered seemed to radiate being, and I knew as never before that I
belonged on this Earth. Of course, the intensity faded after a few days, but I
never forgot that first glimpse of clear seeing, free from the perceptual filters I’d
been carrying around for a lifetime.
Freeing yourself from your story
When you’ve caught a glimpse of who you really are, beyond your mind (and
even your body), you can keep reconnecting with this deeper level of being in
your meditations — and in your everyday life as well. To resurrect the metaphor
of the lake, you can dive down to the bottom again and again because you know
what it looks like and how to find it. (Most approaches to meditation offer the
possibility of such a glimpse. For more-specific instructions, see Chapter 13.)
Even though your story may continue to play on the video screen of your
brain, you can develop the capacity to disengage from it — or even disidentify
from it entirely. As a friend of mine put it, you come to realize that the personal-
ity is a case of mistaken identity — and that who you are is the vast expanse of
being itself, in which your personal thoughts and feelings arise and pass away.
Such a profound realization may take years of meditation to achieve, yet it’s
always available to you, no matter how long you’ve meditated — indeed,
whether you’ve ever meditated at all! Many people report laughing uproariously
89
Chapter 5: How Your Mind Stresses You Out and What You Can Do about It

when they finally see that their true nature was right there all along, as plain as
the proverbial nose on their face.
Contrary to popular belief, people who learn to integrate this realization and
live their understanding in a moment-to-moment way don’t become more
detached and disengaged from life. Rather, because their story and their
sense of separation have lifted like a fog, they actually perceive situations
and people with more immediacy and compassion, and they’re able to act
more appropriately, according to circumstances.

Stopping your mind
Many people believe that the point of medita-
tion is to stop the mind. To get a visceral sense
of the futility of such efforts, you can attempt to
stop your mind and see what happens. Try the
following exercise:
1. Sit quietly and take a few slow, deep
breaths.
2. For the next five minutes, try to stop 
thinking.
That’s right — do whatever you can to keep
your mind from generating more thoughts.
Try humming to yourself or concentrating on
your big toe or recalling a beautiful day in
nature. Or just try being as still as you pos-
sibly can. Do whatever you think will work
for you.
3. At the end of five minutes, reflect on your
experience.
How successful were you? Could you actu-
ally stop thinking for an extended period of
time? Did you find that the struggle to stop
thinking just generated more thoughts? This
exercise reveals how stubborn and tena-
cious your thinking mind can be — in case
you hadn’t noticed.

f you’re looking for simple, concise meditation instructions, you’ve come
to the right chapter. You can muse forever about meditation’s benefits or
the nature of the mind, but there’s nothing quite like attempting to practice
to show you how stubborn and wild the mind can actually be.
As I mention in Chapter 5, the Buddhists like to compare the mind to a
monkey that swings uncontrollably from branch to branch — from plan to
memory, thought to emotion, sight to sound — without ever settling down in
one place. Some contemporary teachers prefer the more domestic analogy of
the wayward puppy that keeps wandering impulsively from one place to
another, blithely peeing on the carpet wherever it goes. You know what it’s
like trying to train a puppy — you can’t overpower it or subdue it or sit on it
until it agrees to obey. Well, the same holds true for your mind. In fact, if you
attempt to force your mind to calm down, you just swirl it up even more and
end up going nowhere fast, like a puppy chasing its tail!
Instead, the practice of meditation involves gently returning your mind again
and again to a simple focus of attention. In this chapter, you have an opportu-
nity to find out how to meditate on your breath — one of the most popular
forms of meditation throughout the world’s spiritual traditions. You also dis-
cover mindfulness techniques for “training your puppy,” balancing relaxation
and alertness, and extending your meditation to include the full range of sen-
sory experiences (that is, hearing, seeing, smelling, touching, and tasting).

Paradoxically, the mundane, repetitive, seemingly inconsequential activity of
attending to your breath can eventually lead to all the glamorous benefits
meditation promises to provide, including reduced stress, enhanced perfor-
mance, increased appreciation and enjoyment of life, deeper connection with
your essential being — even advanced meditative states, such as uncondi-
tional love or transformative insights into the nature of existence. But before
you get carried away counting your cookies (or your puppy biscuits, as the
case may be), you need to take the first step toward the cookie jar.
Turning Your Attention Inward
As the old saying goes, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single
step. In the case of meditation, this simple but essential step involves turning
your mind away from its usual preoccupation with external events — or, just
as often, with the story it tells you about external events — and toward your
inner sensate experience.
If you’re like most people, you’re so caught up with what’s happening around
you — the look in other people’s eyes, the voices of family and co-workers,
the latest news on the radio, the messages appearing on your computer
screen — that you forget to pay attention to what’s happening in your own
mind, body, and heart. In fact, popular culture has been designed to seduce
you into searching outside yourself for happiness and satisfaction. In such a
confusing and compelling world, even the most rudimentary gesture of self-
awareness can seem like a challenge of monumental proportions.
Just take a few minutes right now to turn your mind around and pay attention
to what you’re sensing and feeling. Notice how much resistance you have to
shifting your awareness from your external focus to your simple sensate
experience. Notice how busily your mind flits from thought to thought and
image to image, weaving a story with you as the central character.
Because these habitual patterns are so deeply rooted, doing something as
seemingly innocuous as returning your attention again and again to a basic
internal focus like your breath can take tremendous courage and patience.
You may be afraid of what you’ll discover if you venture into essentially
unknown terrain — or afraid of what you’ll miss if you turn inward even for a
few moments. But this shift from outer to inner is precisely the simple but
radical gesture that meditation requires.
Although I talk about turning inward, the shift I’m suggesting actually has sev-
eral related dimensions:
94
Part II: Getting Started 

 Content to process: Instead of becoming engrossed in the meaning of
what you’re sensing, thinking, or feeling, you can shift your interest and
attention to how experiencing occurs — or to the mere fact of experi-
ence itself. For example, instead of getting lost in thinking or daydream-
ing, you can notice how your mind flits from thought to thought — or
merely observe that you’re thinking. Instead of becoming transfixed by
your fear or what you imagine it means or is trying to tell you, you can
notice how the waves of tension move through your belly — or simply
note that you’re feeling.
 Outer to inner: Initially, you need to balance your usual tendency to be
so outer-directed by paying particular attention to inner experience.
Eventually, you’ll be able to bring the same quality of awareness to
every experience, whether inner or outer.
 Secondhand to direct: Even more helpful than inner and outer is the dis-
tinction between secondhand experience and direct experience.
Secondhand experience has been filtered and distorted by the mind and
is often concerned with thoughts about the past or future, whereas
direct experience is only found in the present and accessed through the
senses. In addition to turning inward, meditation involves turning your
attention away from the story your mind spins about your experience
and toward the direct experience itself.
 Doing to being: You spend virtually all your waking hours rushing from
one task or project or activity to another. Do you remember what it’s like
to just be, the way you did when you were a baby or a little child,
whiling away a summer afternoon just playing or lying in the grass?
Meditation gives you the opportunity to make this crucial shift from
doing to being.
Relaxing Your Body
As the emerging field of mind-body medicine reminds us — and yogis and
sages have been telling us for millennia — your body, your mind, and your
heart form one seamless and inseparable whole. When your thoughts keep
leaping like the proverbial monkey from worry to worry, your body responds
by tightening and tensing, especially in certain key places like the throat, the
heart, the solar plexus, and the belly. When the discomfort gets intense
enough, you register it as an emotion — fear, perhaps, or anger or sadness.
Because it connects you with your direct experience — and ultimately with a
realm of pure being beyond the mind — meditation naturally relaxes your
body while it focuses your mind. As a beginner, though, you may not experi-
ence this natural relaxation for days or even weeks. So it can be helpful to
95
Chapter 6: Meditation 101: Relaxing Your Body and Calming Your Mind

practice one of the techniques in the following list before you meditate, espe-
cially if you tend to be noticeably tense. (If you’re one of those rare people
who are generally so relaxed that you tend to drift off to sleep at the slightest
provocation, you may want to skip this exercise.) Of course, relaxing your
body has its own wonderful benefits — but your body won’t stay relaxed
until you’re able to work with your mind.
If you’ve never deliberately relaxed your body before, start with the medita-
tion in the “Deep relaxation” sidebar. Because the meditation takes at least 15
minutes to complete, you probably won’t do it each time you meditate, but it
does show you how to relax your body part by part. When you’ve practiced
this exercise a few times, your body will have a memory of what it’s like to be
deeply relaxed, and you can then advance to one of the five-minute relaxations
listed here. By the way, deep relaxation is a great antidote for insomnia — just
practice it in bed and then drift off to sleep!
So here are five brief relaxation techniques:
 Shower of relaxation: Imagine taking a warm shower. As the water cas-
cades across your body and down your legs, it carries with it all discom-
fort and distress, leaving you refreshed and invigorated.
 Honey treatment: Imagine a mound of warm honey perched on the crown
of your head. As it melts, it runs down your face and head and neck, cov-
ering your shoulders and chest and arms, and gradually enveloping your
whole body down to your toes. Feel the sensuous wave of warm liquid
draining away all tension and stress and leaving you thoroughly relaxed
and renewed.
 Peaceful place: Imagine a safe, protected, peaceful place — perhaps a
forest, a meadow, or a sandy beach. Experience the place fully with all
your senses. Notice how calm and relaxed you feel here; now allow that
feeling to permeate every cell of your body.
 Body scan: Beginning with the crown of your head, scan your body from
top to bottom. When you come to an area of tension or discomfort,
gently allow it to open and soften; then move on.
 Relaxation response: Choose a word or brief phrase that has deep spiri-
tual or personal significance for you. Now close your eyes and repeat
this sound softly, again and again. (For more detailed instructions on
practicing the Relaxation Response, see Chapter 18.)

off your shoes, loosen your belt and other
tight clothing, and stretch out on your back
with your arms resting at your sides, legs
slightly apart.
2. Sense your body as a whole, including the
places where it contacts the surface of the
bed or floor.
3. Close your eyes and bring your awareness
to your feet. Wiggle your toes, flex your
feet, and then let go of all tension as much
as you can, allowing your feet to melt into
the floor.
4. Shift your awareness to your lower legs,
thighs, and hips. Imagine them becoming
heavy and relaxed and melting into the
floor.
If the image of melting doesn’t appeal to
you, you might try dissolving, sinking, or dis-
appearing.
5. Bring your awareness to your lower
abdomen. Imagine all tension draining
away, your breath deepening, and your
belly opening and softening.
6. Bring your awareness to your upper
abdomen, chest, neck, and throat, feeling
the areas opening and softening.
7. Bring your awareness to your shoulders,
upper arms, lower arms, and hands.
Imagine them becoming heavy and relaxed
and melting into the floor.
8. Bring your awareness to your head and
face. Feel the tension melting away from
your face across your head and into the
floor.
9. Scan your body from head to toe, search-
ing for any remaining areas of tension or
discomfort.
If you find any, just imagine them relaxing
completely.
10. Experience your body as one field of relax-
ation, without parts or edges.
11. Continue to rest in this way for five or ten
minutes more; then very slowly begin to
wiggle your fingers and toes, stretch your
arms and legs, open your eyes, and gradu-
ally come up to a sitting position.
Check in with yourself and notice how you feel.
Do you feel more relaxed? Does your body feel
lighter or more expanded? Does the world
appear different in any way? Now gently get up
and go about your day.

Developing Mindfulness: Awareness 
of the Here and Now
This chapter highlights an approach to meditation known as mindfulness —
moment to moment awareness of your experience as it unfolds. Mindfulness
combines concentration (highly focused awareness) and a more receptive
awareness that simply welcomes whatever arises. Because mindfulness
grows like a house on a foundation of concentration, you’ll need to
strengthen and stabilize your concentration before you can proceed to the
full practice of mindfulness. That’s why the initial meditations provided here
emphasize focusing on a particular object of concentration — your breath.
Ultimately, the goal of mindfulness meditation is to develop the capacity to
be fully present for whatever is occurring right here and now. When you’ve
stabilized your concentration by focusing on your breath, you can expand
your awareness to include the full range of bodily sensations — and eventu-
ally you can just welcome whatever presents itself in your field of experience.
Though supremely simple, this advanced technique can take years of patient
practice to master, but you may have glimpses of a more expanded aware-
ness after only a few weeks of regular meditation.

Part II: Getting Started 
Letting go of your expectations
When you invest in the stock market or work out
at a gym, you expect results — and you keep
checking the quotes or the scale to tell you how
well you’re doing. If you bring the same attitude
to meditation, however, you’re defeating the
purpose — which is to let go of your thoughts
altogether and just be present in the here and
now. One of the great paradoxes of meditation
is that you can’t reap the benefits until you drop
all your expectations and accept things the way
they are. Then the benefits come back to you a
thousandfold.
In the beginning, of course, you’re going to keep
wondering whether you’re doing it right. But
don’t worry, there’s no wrong way to meditate —
except perhaps sitting and trying to measure
how well you’re doing! One day you may feel
like you’re on top of the world — you’re full of
energy, your mind is clear, and you can follow
your breath with relative ease. “Wow, now I’m
getting the hang of it,” you think. The next day
you’re so overwhelmed by thoughts or emotions
that you sit for 20 minutes without even noticing
your breath. Welcome to the practice of medi-
tation! The point is not to do it right, but just to
do it — again and again.
One of my Zen teachers used to compare med-
itation to walking in the fog on a warm summer
day: Though you may not pay attention to what’s
happening, pretty soon you’re drenched in dew.

Focusing on your breath
Compared to surfing the Net or catching a movie on HBO, watching your
breath may seem like a boring way to spend your spare time. The fact is, the
media have conditioned us to be stimulation junkies by flooding our senses
with computerized images and synthesized sounds that change at laserlike
speed. Recently, I heard the head of an ad agency brag about how his latest
TV spot bombarded the viewer with six images per second — far faster than
the conscious mind could possibly register them.
By contrast, paying attention to the coming and going of your breath slows
your mind to match the speed and rhythms of your body. Instead of 6 images
per second, you breathe an average of 12 to 16 times per minute. And the
sensations are far subtler than anything you’ll see or hear on TV — more like
the sights and sounds of nature, which is, after all, where you and your body
came from.
Besides, the great thing about your breath as a focus of meditation is that it’s
always available, always changing yet always more or less the same. If your
breath were totally different each time, it wouldn’t provide the stability nec-
essary for you to cultivate concentration; if it never changed in any way,
you’d quickly fall asleep and never have an opportunity to develop the
curiosity and alertness that are so essential to the practice of mindfulness.
As a preliminary to the practice of following your breath, you may want to
spend a few weeks or months just counting your breaths. It’s a great way to
build concentration — and it provides a preestablished structure that con-
stantly reminds you when you’re wandering off. If you were a neophyte Zen
student, you might spend years counting your breaths before you graduated

Chapter 6: Meditation 101: Relaxing Your Body and Calming Your Mind
The meaning of the breath
Traditional cultures identified the breath with
the life force that animates all things. For exam-
ple, the Latin word spiritus (the root of both spir-
ited and spiritual), the Greek word anima (from
which we derive the word animated), the
Hebrew word ruach, and the Sanskrit word
brahman may sound quite different, but they
have one thing in common: They all mean both
breath and spirit or soul. When you follow your
breath with awareness, you’re not only harmo-
nizing your body and mind, which gives you a
sense of inner harmony and wholeness, you’re
also exploring the living frontier where body,
mind, and spirit meet — and attuning yourself
to a spiritual dimension of being.

to a more challenging practice. But if you’re feeling adventurous or already
have some confidence in your concentration, by all means start with following
your breath. Trust your intuition to tell you which method is right for you.
Counting your breaths
Begin by finding a comfortable sitting position that you can hold for 10 or 15
minutes. (For a complete discussion of sitting posture in meditation, includ-
ing diagrams, see Chapter 7.) Then take a few deep breaths and exhale
slowly. Without trying to control your breath in any way, allow it to find its
own natural depth and rhythm. Always breathe through your nose unless you
can’t for some reason.
Now begin counting each inhalation and exhalation until you reach ten; then
return to one. In other words, when you inhale, count “one,” when you
exhale, count “two,” when you inhale again, count “three,” and so on up to
ten. If you lose track, return to one and start again.
To help you concentrate, you may find it useful to extend the number in your
mind for the full duration of the inhalation or exhalation, instead of thinking the
number quickly once and then dropping it. For example, allow “o-o-o-n-n-n-e” to
last as long as the inhalation, “t-w-o-o-o-o” to last as long as the exhalation, and
100
Part II: Getting Started 
Getting to know your breathing
When you first begin paying deliberate attention
to your breath, you may be surprised and some-
what frustrated to discover that your body tenses
up and your breathing becomes stiff, labored,
and unnatural. Suddenly, you can’t remember
how to breathe anymore, even though you’ve
been doing it just fine ever since your first breath
at birth.
Don’t worry — you’re not doing it wrong. You
just need to develop a lighter, gentler touch with
your awareness so that you’re following but not
controlling your breath. It’s kind of like learning
to ride a bicycle — you keep falling off until one
day, miraculously, you just keep going. From
then on, it’s second nature.
You may find it helpful to begin by exploring your
breathing, without necessarily trying to track 
it from breath to breath. Notice what happens
when you breathe — how your rib cage rises
and falls, how your belly moves, how the air
passes in and out of your nostrils. You may find
that some breaths are longer and deeper, while
others are shorter and shallower. Some may go
all the way down into your belly, while others
barely reach the upper part of your lungs before
exiting again. Some may be rough or strong,
others smooth or weak.
Spend five or ten minutes exploring your breath-
ing with the fresh curiosity of a child encoun-
tering a flower or a butterfly for the first time.
What did you discover that you didn’t know
before? How does each new breath differ from
the last? When you feel comfortable with your
breath, you can begin the practice of counting
or following your breaths.

so on. You may also find it helpful to subvocalize the numbers, especially at
first, saying “one” ever so softly to yourself as you inhale, “two” as you
exhale, and so on.
As Mickey Mouse as this exercise may seem at first-read, you may be surprised
to discover that you never manage to reach ten without losing count. You don’t
have to stop your mind chatter in any way. But if you get distracted by your
thoughts and lose track of your breath, come back to one and start again.
When you get the knack of counting each in-breath and out-breath — say,
after a month or two of regular practice — you can shift to counting only the
exhalations. If your mind starts wandering on the inhalations, though, just go
back to the first method until you feel ready to move on again. Eventually,
you may want to simplify the practice even further by simply noting “in” on
the inhalation and “out” on the exhalation.
Following your breaths
Begin by sitting and breathing exactly as you did for counting your breaths.
(If you would prefer to follow the audio instructions for this meditation, listen
to Track 4 on the CD.) When you feel settled, allow your attention to focus
either on the sensation of your breath coming and going through your nos-
trils or on the rising and falling of your belly as you breathe. (Although you’re
welcome to alternate your focus from one session to the next, it’s best to
stick with a single focus for the entire meditation — and eventually you’re
better off using the same focus each time you meditate.)
Give your full attention to the coming and going of your breath the way a
mother tracks the movements of her young child — lovingly yet persistently,
softly yet precisely, with relaxed yet focused awareness. When you realize
that your mind has wandered off and you’re engrossed in planning or think-
ing or daydreaming, gently but firmly bring it back to your breath.
At the end of your exhalation (and before you inhale again), there’s often a
gap or a pause when your breath is no longer perceptible. At this point, you
can allow your attention to rest on a predetermined touchpoint, such as your
navel or your hands, before returning to your breath when it resumes.
Thoughts and images will definitely continue to skitter and swirl through
your mind as you meditate, but don’t worry. Just patiently and persistently
keep coming back to your breath. Gradually, you may even develop a fascina-
tion with all the little sensations — of your belly and ribcage shifting and
opening and changing shape as you breathe or of your breath caressing the
tip of your nose, tickling your nostrils, and cooling your nasal passages as it
enters and leaves. You may also notice that your mind tends to quiet down or
your thinking tends to change on either the exhalation or the inhalation. By
attuning to a subtler level of experience while you meditate, you can open
yourself to a subtler appreciation of each moment of life as it unfolds.
101
Chapter 6: Meditation 101: Relaxing Your Body and Calming Your Mind

Expanding to sensations
As soon as you’ve developed a certain ease in following your breath, you can
expand your awareness as you meditate to include the full range of sensa-
tions both inside and outside your body — feeling, smelling, hearing, seeing.
Imagine that your awareness is like the zoom lens on a camera. Until now,
you’ve been focused exclusively on your breath; now you can back away
slightly to include the field of sensations that surrounds your breath.
If you find it difficult to expand your awareness all at once, you can begin by
exploring a sensation when it calls attention to itself. For example, you’re fol-
lowing your breath when a pain in your back cries out for your attention.
Instead of staying focused on your breath as you would have done before,
you can turn your attention to the pain and explore it fully until it no longer
predominates in your field of experience. Then come back to your breath
until you’re once again called away.
You can also experiment with expanding your awareness to include one par-
ticular kind of sensation, such as bodily feelings or sounds. For example, you
can spend an entire meditation just listening to the sounds around you, with-
out focusing on any sounds in particular. In this way, you’re able to balance
the highly concentrated awareness required to follow your breath with the
more receptive, all-inclusive awareness necessary to welcome a broad range
of sensations. This blend of focus and receptivity lies at the heart of the prac-
tice of mindfulness.
As you get the knack of including sensations in your meditations, you can
experiment with expanding your awareness to include the full sensate field
102
Part II: Getting Started 
Minding your body instead of your breath
Some people seem to find it virtually impossible
to count or follow their breaths. Instead, they
find it helpful to focus on their body as a whole
when they meditate. You can begin by drawing
your awareness slowly down through your body
from your head to your feet; then switch to hold-
ing your whole body in your awareness at once.
When your mind wanders off, just come back to
your body. Or you can use the Zen approach of
focusing on a particular part of the body, like the
lower back or lower abdomen. When you find a
focus that works for you, however, stick with it.
The point is to develop your mindfulness, not to
meander through your body in search of a place
to meditate.

(that is, hearing, seeing, smelling, touching, and tasting). Begin by following
your breathing and then just open your lens wide, allowing sensations to
arise and pass away in your awareness.
Welcoming whatever arises
When you become accustomed to including sensations, you can open your
awareness gates wide and welcome any and every experience — even thoughts
and emotions — without judgment or discrimination. Just like sensations,
thoughts and feelings come and go in your awareness like clouds in the sky
without pulling you off center.
After all, the sky is never disturbed or constricted, no matter how many
clouds pile up; it continues to be as vast and spacious as ever. In the same
way, you can sit with a spacious, skylike mind. At first, you may find your
attention drawn here and there like a flashlight, exploring one object and
then another. But just keep coming back to a spacious, skylike mind. (A note
of caution, however: This practice, though supremely simple, is actually quite
advanced and requires well-developed powers of concentration to sustain.
For more on welcoming whatever arises, see Chapter 12.)
Training Your Puppy: Reining In 
Your Wandering Mind
Like a wayward puppy, your mind means well — it just has a will of its own
and some pretty obnoxious habits to unlearn. Just as you wouldn’t hit a
puppy for peeing on the carpet, but you would keep carrying it patiently back
103
Chapter 6: Meditation 101: Relaxing Your Body and Calming Your Mind
Keep it simple
The point of meditation is not to discover some
cool techniques to occupy your leisure hours;
it’s to make the simple but momentous shift from
doing to being. Don’t make the mistake of turn-
ing your meditation practice into another urgent
item on your list of things to do. Use it, instead,
as a welcome oasis from doing, an opportunity
to be, without strategy or agenda. In other
words, keep it simple. Play with a few of the
techniques at first to decide which one feels
right for you; then stick with the one you’ve
chosen. It really doesn’t matter which method
you use — they all end up depositing you in the
here and now.

to its little pile of papers, you need to keep leading your wandering mind
patiently back to its focus of concentration, without anger or violence or
judgment of any kind. After all, you want your “puppy mind” to like you and
treat you as a friend, instead of cowering in your presence.
In fact, your mind deserves even more patience than a puppy because it’s
developed the tendency to fantasize, worry, and obsess through a lifetime of
poor training. As you practice being kind and patient with your mind, you
naturally soften and relax into the present moment — which is, after all, the
point of meditation. On the other hand, if you force your mind to concentrate
like a drill sergeant pushing his troops, you’re just going to wind up tense and
uncomfortable — and you probably won’t be motivated to meditate again.
As I note in other chapters, discovering how to meditate is a lot like practic-
ing a musical instrument. First you need to assemble some basic techniques;
then you get to practice the same scales over and over. Like following your
breath, playing scales can seem incredibly boring — but week by week, you
become imperceptibly better, until one day you graduate to playing simple
tunes. And the more you practice, the more subtleties you notice, and the
more interesting even playing simple scales — or following your breath —
becomes.
The historical Buddha compared meditating to tuning a lute. If you make the
strings too tight, they break, and you can’t play the instrument at all. If you
make them too loose, you can’t get the right sounds. Likewise, you need to

Part II: Getting Started 
Just sitting
As an alternative to mindfulness meditation, you
may want to experiment with the Zen practice
known as just sitting, which usually involves two
phases or steps: just breathing and just sitting.
When you’re adept at following your breath, you
can practice becoming your breath — merging
yourself completely with the flow of the inhala-
tion and exhalation, until you, as a separate
observer, disappear and only your breath
remains. Now you’re no longer breathing;
instead, your breath is breathing you. Like wel-
coming whatever arises, this practice, known
as just breathing, is supremely simple but
requires a quality of awareness that’s both
focused and relaxed.
The next step, just sitting, involves expanding to
include the whole realm of sensate experience.
But instead of being aware or mindful of your
experience, you “disappear,” and only your
experience remains — seeing, smelling, hear-
ing, sensing, thinking. As a Zen friend of mine
put it, “When you sit, the walls of the medita-
tion hall come down, and the whole world
enters.” Ultimately, this practice takes you to
the same place as mindfulness; it’s simply the
Zen alternative.

listen to your instrument — your body and mind — when you meditate to
determine what kind of tuning you need. If you’re tense, you may want to
begin with some deep relaxation; if you’re sleepy or foggy, you may need to
sit up straight, pay attention, and emphasize your concentration.
As you gently bring your puppy back again and again, you also get to notice
the themes and stories that repeatedly draw your attention away. Perhaps
your mind keeps returning to worries about job security, or arguments with
your partner or spouse, or sexual fantasies, or popular songs. Whatever the
favorite bones your puppy likes to chew, you gradually become familiar with
them as you watch them distract you.
After weeks and months of regular practice, you develop a deeper under-
standing of how your mind works — and how it causes suffering and stress.
And like hit tunes you love at first but eventually get tired of hearing, the
same old stories start to lose their power to disturb you, and you develop
greater equanimity and peace of mind. (For more on working with your sto-
ries and habitual themes, see Chapter 11.)
105
Chapter 6: Meditation 101: Relaxing Your Body and Calming Your Mind
Working with your mind at first
Right now, the whole notion of working with
your mind may seem totally incomprehensible.
After all, thoughts may fill your head like fog,
and you can’t see even the faintest trace of blue
sky beyond them.
The good news is, you don’t have to pay any
attention to your mind, at least initially. Just
keep following your breath, and when you
become lost in thought, which you will no doubt
do again and again, gently come back. The point
is not to stop your mind — an impossible task in
any case — but to stay focused on your breath
no matter what your mind does.
After weeks and months of regular practice, you
may begin to notice that your mind settles down
more quickly during your meditations and that
fewer thoughts disturb your concentration. In
any case, the quality of your mind will no doubt
vary from day to day and from meditation to
meditation.
Here, the point is not to make your mind work
differently, but to slowly but surely strengthen
and stabilize your concentration. Eventually,
you’ll begin to notice that your mind doesn’t
have the same power over you that it once did
and that you have moments of deep peace and
tranquility. Trust me — it will actually happen,
even to you!

Coming back to your breath
Set your watch or clock to signal the beginning
of every hour. When the alarm sounds, stop
whatever you’re doing and follow your breath
with full attention for 60 seconds. If you’re doing
something that can’t be stopped, like driving a
car in traffic or talking to your boss, follow your
breath as attentively as you can while engaging
in the activity.

 Six great stretches to prepare you for sitting
P
erhaps you know a few meditation techniques, but you haven’t really
begun to practice them because you can’t sit still for more than a few
minutes, let alone 5, 10, or even 15.
Maybe your back or your knees start hurting, and you worry you may be
doing yourself irreparable harm. Or your body starts itching in the oddest
places, and you can’t resist the urge to scratch. Or every sound reaches your
ears magnified a thousandfold — in Dolby stereo, no less — and you start
imagining burglars or leaky faucets behind every door.
Perhaps you had a teacher (or a mother or father!) who made you sit at your
desk until you finished your schoolwork, and now even the thought of having
to sit without moving makes you squirm uncomfortably.
Yes, the simple act of sitting still is guaranteed to flush out every ounce of
restlessness you never knew you had. And, yes, meditation works best when
you can keep your body relatively motionless and your back relatively
straight. So what to do?
In this chapter, you explore the topography of meditation and find out what
sitting still has to teach you. You discover some great techniques for straight-
ening your spine without hurting your back. And you have an opportunity to
practice some dynamite yoga poses for lengthening and relaxing the muscles
most involved in sitting — so you can sit still longer, and enjoy it more! (For
audio guidance in preparing your body for sitting meditation, listen to Track 5
on the CD.)

Putting a Snake into a Stick 
of Bamboo — or the Subtle 
Art of Sitting Still
When talking about the practice of sitting still, one of my first meditation
teachers, the Zen master Shunryu Suzuki, used to say that the best way to
show a snake its true nature is to put it into a hollow stick of bamboo. Take a
moment and give this unusual metaphor some thought. What could he have
possibly meant by it?
Well, imagine that you’re a snake in bamboo. What does it feel like? Every
time you try to slither, which is after all what snakes like to do, you bump
against the walls of your straight-as-an-arrow home. If you pay attention, you
start to notice how slippery you actually are.
In the same way, sitting in a certain posture and keeping your body relatively
still provides a stick of bamboo that mirrors back to you every impulse and
distraction. You get to see how fidgety your body can be — and how hyperac-
tive your mind can be, which is actually the source of your body’s restless-
ness. “Maybe I should scratch that itch or answer that phone or run that
errand.” For every plan or intention, there’s a corresponding impulse in your
muscles and skin. But you’ll never notice all this activity unless you sit still.
The funny thing is, you can sit in the same position for hours without notic-
ing it when you’re happily engrossed in some favorite activity like watching a
movie or surfing the Net or working on a hobby. But try to do something you
find boring or unpleasant — especially an activity as strange and unfamiliar
as turning your attention back on yourself and following your own breath or
paying attention to your own sensations — and suddenly every minute can
seem like an hour, every ache can seem like an ailment of life-threatening pro-
portions, and every item on your to-do list can take on irresistible urgency.
When you’re constantly acting and reacting in response to thoughts and out-
side stimulation, you don’t have a chance to get to know how your mind
works. By sitting still like the snake in bamboo, you have a mirror that shows
you just how slippery and elusive your mind can be.
Keeping still also gives you a tremendous edge when you’re working on
developing your concentration. Imagine a heart surgeon or a concert pianist
who can’t quiet her body while plying her craft. The fewer physical distrac-
tions you have, the easier it becomes to follow your breath, practice your
mantra — or whatever your meditation happens to be.
108
Part II: Getting Started 

A word of caution, however: These sitting instructions aren’t intended to turn
your body into a stone, any more than the bamboo is meant to turn the snake
into a stick. As long as you’re alive, you’re going to keep moving. The point is
to set your intention to sit still and notice what happens. The Buddha liked to
use the metaphor of a lute — if the strings are too loose, you can’t play it,
and if they’re too tight, they’ll break! If you’re too rigid with yourself, you’ll
just end up miserable — but if you keep shifting your body this way and that,
you’ll never get your mind concentrated and quiet enough to reap the bene-
fits of meditation.
How to Sit Up Straight — 
and Live to Tell About It
If you examine the meditation poses depicted in the world’s great spiritual
traditions, you’ll find that they all have one thing in common — the unshak-
able stability of a mountain or tree. Look at the kneeling pharaohs in the
Egyptian pyramids, for example, or the cross-legged Buddhas in Indian caves
or Japanese temples. They sit on a broad base that appears to be deeply
rooted in the earth, and they have a grounded presence that says, “I can’t be
budged. I’m here to stay” (see Figure 7-1).
109
Chapter 7: Preparing for Meditation: Posture, Stretching, and Sitting Still
Sitting still, doing nothing
When I was a young Zen meditator, I worked as
an attendant in a nursing home that hosted a
range of patients, from a young woman recover-
ing from bone cancer to our local Congressman’s
father, who was dying of emphysema.
Amidst this busy throng, I was fascinated by one
person in particular — an old Italian fisherman
who had lost both legs in a fishing accident.
When his family members came to visit, he
would hold court with great dignity, receiving
their respect as the family patriarch. Where
other patients might be content to lie in bed all
day in their hospital gowns, he would dress and
groom himself each day and sit with pride —
and upright posture — in his wheelchair, silently
observing the drama that unfolded around him.
One day, I was running back and forth, unsure
of what I was supposed to be doing. Seeing this,
he called out to me, with a mischievous gleam in
his eye, “Hey! You got nothing to do?” “Yeah,” I
said,” obviously flustered, “I don’t know what
I’m supposed to be doing.” “You got nothing to
do,” he said, “then sit down!”

When you sit up straight like a mountain or a tree, your body acts as a link
between heaven and earth — and, by analogy, connects your physical, embod-
ied existence with the sacred or spiritual dimension of being. Many traditions
talk about the importance of bridging the apparent chasm that separates us
from God or the Absolute. Jewish and Sufi mystics teach that the soul is a spark
of the heavenly fire that yearns to return to its source. Christians depict the soul
as a dove ascending, and Indian tantric yogis (see Chapter 3) describe the ecsta-
tic union of Shakti, the feminine energy of spiritual evolution that rises through
the spine, with Shiva, the masculine principle of detached transcendence.
If you find all this spiritual stuff too esoteric or airy-fairy, you might consider
that sitting up straight confers some practical benefits as well. By aligning the
spine and opening the channels that run through the center of the body,
upright sitting encourages an unimpeded circulation of energy, which, in
turn, contributes to wakefulness on all levels — physical, mental, and spiri-
tual. Besides, it’s a lot easier to sit still for extended periods of time when
your vertebrae are stacked like a pile of bricks, one on top of the other.
Otherwise, over time, gravity has this irritating habit of pulling your body
down toward the ground — and in the process, causing the aches and pains
so typical of a body at war with the forces of nature. So the most comfortable
way to sit in the long run is straight, which puts you in harmony with nature.

Part II: Getting Started 

Of course, you can always lean against the wall — or so you may think. But
your body tends to slouch when it leans, even subtly, in any direction; and
the point of doing meditation is to rely on your direct experience, rather than
to depend on some outside support to “back you up.” When you sit like a
mountain or a tree, you’re making a statement: “I’m deeply rooted in the
earth, yet open to the higher powers of the cosmos — independent, yet inex-
tricably connected to all of life.”
What to do from the waist down — 
and other fantasies
Just as a tree needs to set down deep roots so it won’t fall over as it grows,
you need to find a comfortable position for the lower half of your body that
you can sustain for 5, 10, or 15 minutes — or even longer, if you want. After

Dealing with pain
If you sit in the same position for an extended
period of time, you’re going to experience some
physical pain or discomfort, no matter how
much stretching you do! An ache in your back
here, some knee pain there, a twinge in your
shoulder, pins and needles in your foot — the
list of complaints is potentially endless. And the
longer you sit, the more intense the discomfort
may become — and the stronger the temptation
to move or fidget to avoid it.
Instead of instantly shifting your position or
struggling to ignore your discomfort, practice
gently expanding your awareness to include
your discomfort, while continuing to attend to
your breath or other object of meditation. If the
pain is strong, you can explore it directly with
the same mindful, compassionate attention you
bring to your breath.
Notice also how your mind responds to your
discomfort. Does it fabricate some story about
your discomfort: “I’m not sitting correctly. There
must be something wrong with my back. Maybe
I’m ruining my knees”? And does it intensify
your discomfort by judging it as bad or undesir-
able, causing you to tense up around it?
By opening your awareness to your pain and
how your mind responds to it, you can actu-
ally begin to soften and relax in relation to the
pain — and you may notice that it diminishes
accordingly. Because physical and emotional
pain are unavoidable, sitting meditation pro-
vides a wonderful laboratory for experimenting
with new ways of relating to suffering and dis-
comfort in every area of your life — and ulti-
mately moving beyond them.
By the way, you also have the option of moving
(with awareness) when the pain or discomfort
becomes too intense. Just play at your own
edge between opening and resisting. And
remember that certain kinds of pain may merit
your immediate attention — especially shooting
pain, pain that begins as soon as you start sit-
ting, and sharp (rather than dull) pain in your
knees. In such cases, you’re better off trying a
different sitting position.

several millennia of experimentation, the great meditators have come up with
a handful of traditional postures that seem to work especially well. Different
though they may appear from the outside, these postures have one thing in
common: the pelvis tilts slightly forward, accentuating the natural curvature
of the lower back.
The following poses are arranged more or less in order, from the easiest to
the hardest to do, though ease all depends on your particular body and
degree of flexibility. For example, some people take to the classical lotus
position (whose name derives from its resemblance to the flower) like a duck
to . . . well, to a lotus pond. Besides, the lotus, though difficult, has some defi-
nite advantages (see the sidebar “Why the Buddha sat in lotus position,” later
in this chapter), and you can work up to it by stretching your hips using the
yoga exercises described in the section “Preparing Your Body for Sitting,”
later in this chapter. Above all, don’t worry about which looks the coolest;
just experiment until you find the one that works best for you.
Sitting in a chair
Notice that I say sitting, not slouching (see Figure 7-2). The trick to meditating 
in a chair is positioning your buttocks somewhat higher than your knees, which
tilts your pelvis forward and helps keep your back straight. Old-fashioned
wooden kitchen chairs work better than the upholstered kind; experiment with
a small cushion or foam wedge under your buttocks.

Part II: Getting Started 

Kneeling (with or without a bench)
This position is popular in ancient Egypt and in traditional Japan, where it’s
called seiza (pronounced say-za; see Figure 7-3). Kneeling can be — well, hard
on your knees, unless you have proper support. Try placing a cushion under
your buttocks and between your feet — or use a specially designed seiza
bench, preferably one with a soft cushion between you and the wood.
Otherwise, your bottom and other tender parts may fall asleep.
Easy position
This position is not recommended for extended periods of sitting, because
it’s not very stable and doesn’t support a straight spine. Simply sit on your
cushion with your legs crossed in front of you, tailor-fashion. (Believe it or
not, tailors once sat this way!) Your knees don’t have to touch the floor, but
do keep your back as straight as you can.

113
Chapter 7: Preparing for Meditation: Posture, Stretching, and Sitting Still

You can stabilize the position by placing cushions under your knees; gradu-
ally decrease the height of the cushions as your hips become more flexible
(which they naturally will over time). When your knees touch the ground,
you may be ready for Burmese or lotus position (see the following sections
for these positions).
This pose can be a short-term alternative for people who can’t manage the
other positions in this section, can’t kneel because of knee problems, or don’t
want to sit on a chair for some reason.
Burmese position
Used throughout Southeast Asia, the Burmese position (see Figure 7-4)
involves placing both calves and feet on the floor one in front of the other.
Though less stable than the lotus series, it’s much easier to negotiate, espe-
cially for beginners.

Part II: Getting Started 

With all the cross-legged poses, first bend your leg at the knee, in line with
your thigh, before rotating your thigh to the side. Otherwise, you risk injuring
your knee, which is built to flex in only one direction, unlike the ball-and-
socket joint of the hip, which can rotate through a full range of motion.
Quarter lotus
Exactly like half lotus (see the following section), except that your foot rests
on the calf of your opposite leg, rather than on the thigh (see Figure 7-5).
Half lotus
The half lotus is easier to execute than the famous full lotus (see the follow-
ing section), and nearly as stable (see Figure 7-6). With your buttocks on a
cushion, place one foot on the opposite thigh and the other foot on the floor
beneath the opposite thigh. Be sure that both knees touch the floor and your
spine doesn’t tilt to one side. To distribute the pressure on your back and
legs, remember to alternate legs from sitting to sitting, if you can — in other
words, left leg on the thigh and right on the floor, then left on the floor and
right on the thigh.

As its name

115
Chapter 7: Preparing for Meditation: Posture, Stretching, and Sitting Still

Full lotus
Considered the Everest of sitting positions (refer to Figure 7-1). With your
buttocks on a cushion, cross your left foot over your right thigh and your
right foot over your left thigh. As with its more asymmetrical sibling, half
lotus, it’s best to alternate legs in order to distribute the pressure evenly.
Full lotus has been practiced throughout the world for many thousands of
years. The most stable of all the poses, don’t attempt it unless you happen to
be particularly flexible — and even then I suggest preparing by doing some of
the stretches described later in this chapter, in the section “Preparing Your
Body for Sitting.”
Straightening your spine 
without rigor mortis
When you’re settled into a comfortable sitting position, with your pelvis
tilted slightly forward, you can turn your attention to straightening your
back. Of course, straight is a misnomer when used to refer to the spine,
Figure 7-6:
In half 
lotus, try to
alternate
your legs
between
sittings as
much as
you can.
116
Part II: Getting Started 

because a healthy back actually has several distinct curves, one at the
lumbar region or lower back, another at the thoracic area or midback, and a
third at the neck or cervical spine.
Unfortunately, these natural curves are often exaggerated by the demands of
computer workstations and other sedentary environments, and you gradu-
ally get into the habit of sitting hunched over, with your shoulders rounded,
your upper back collapsed, and your neck and head craned forward like a
turkey vulture — the way I’m sitting right now!
You may not be able to reverse sitting habits like these in a few sessions of
meditation, but you can experiment with extending your spine — a more
accurate term than straightening — and slowly but surely softening those
curves back to their natural, graceful arch. You may find yourself carrying
these new sitting habits into your other activities so that in time, you’re
gently correcting your posture while driving your car or sitting at your desk,
for example.
Try one or all three of the following images to help you discover what a
straight or extended spine feels like. Don’t bother to look in the mirror or
compare yourself to some ideal you’ve picked up in books (even this one).
117
Chapter 7: Preparing for Meditation: Posture, Stretching, and Sitting Still
Why the Buddha sat in lotus position
Unfortunately, we didn’t learn to sit cross-
legged on the floor when we were kids, the way
most Indians and many other traditional Asians
did. As a result, you may find it difficult to sit
cross-legged at first, and you may feel inclined
to retreat to the apparent ease and comfort of a
chair. But I’d like to encourage you to give
cross-legged sitting a try at some point, if your
body and comfort level allow. It isn’t necessar-
ily as difficult or as painful as it appears — and
besides, it has some unique advantages.
For one thing, crossing your legs creates a solid,
stable foundation for the rest of your body and
tends to tilt your pelvis forward naturally at just
the right angle to support your spine.
Also, there’s something about sitting the way
the great meditators of the past used to sit that
lends a certain power and authority to your
meditation — as though crossing your legs
immerses you in a river of awareness that dates
back thousands of years.
Finally, sitting with your buttocks on or close to
the earth directly connects you with gravity and
the other energies the earth emanates — and
gives a palpable feeling of groundedness and
strength to your meditation.
Ultimately, of course, whatever you do with the
lower half of your body is fine, as long as you
can sit comfortably and keep your back straight
with relative ease. But you can work up to the
luxury of cross-legged sitting by gradually
stretching your hips, until, one day, both knees
touch the floor and — voilà! — you’ve arrived.

The important thing is how your body feels from the inside. You want to feel
centered, stable, grounded — and aligned with the force of gravity:
 Suspending your head from a string: Imagine that your entire body is
suspended in the air from a string attached to the crown of your head.
(The crown is the highest point on the top of your skull, toward the
back.) As you feel the string pulling your head up into the air, notice how
your spine naturally lengthens, your pelvis tilts forward, your chin
tucks, and the back of your neck flattens slightly.
 Stacking your vertebrae one on top of another: Imagine your vertebrae
as bricks that you’re stacking one on top of the other, beginning with the
first at the base of the spine. Feel your spine growing up toward the sky
brick by brick, like a skyscraper.
 Sitting like a mountain or tree: Imagine your body as a mountain or tree
with a broad base that extends deep into the earth and a trunk or peak
that reaches toward the sky (see Figure 7-7). Notice how stable,
grounded, and self-sufficient you feel.
Figure 7-7:
Here’s how
you look
from the
side when
you extend
your spine.
118
Part II: Getting Started 

When you know what it feels like to sit upright with your spine extended, you
can rock your body from side to side like a pendulum, first broadly and then
in gradually decreasing arcs until you come to rest in the center. Next, you
can tilt your pelvis forward slightly, accentuating the natural curvature of
your lower back, and then lean forward and backward from the waist (keep-
ing your back straight) until you come to center. Finally, tuck your chin and
draw your head back gently. Now you’re ready to begin your meditation.
At first, you may need to use these techniques and images again and again to
help you return to a comfortable, upright sitting position. But eventually,
you’ll find that sitting up straight becomes a far more intuitive and immediate
affair — you’ll just sit down, rock a little from side to side, gently extend your
spine, and start meditating.
Zafus, benches, and other 
exotic paraphernalia
Depending on which meditation tradition you explore, you’re likely to
encounter a range of different sitting devices. Some yogis I know like to plop
down a tiny rectangular bag filled with rice before they artfully settle onto it
and cross their legs in full lotus. Many Zen folks and other Buddhists prefer
the plump round cushions known as zafus (Japanese for “sitting cushions”),
often combined with flat, square cushions filled with cotton batting for extra
height, if needed (see Figure 7-8).
119
Chapter 7: Preparing for Meditation: Posture, Stretching, and Sitting Still
Meditating on your posture
As an alternative to following your breath, espe-
cially when you want to calm your mind before
turning to the practice of mindfulness (see
Chapter 6), you can experiment with the time-
honored Zen technique of concentrating on a
particular part of your body. Try placing your
mind in the palm of your hand, if your hands are
folded in Zen mudra (refer to Figure 7-1 and the
“What to do with your eyes, mouth, and hands”
sidebar in this chapter), or on your belly, at a
point about 2 inches below your navel (known
as the hara in Japanese). After you practice this
approach for a period of time and your attention
stabilizes, you can expand your focus to include
your whole body, maintaining the same level of
Zen-style concentration.

120
Part II: Getting Started 
What to do with your eyes, mouth, and hands
When I started meditating back in the ’60s, I
couldn’t for the life of me figure out what to do
with my eyes. They kept crossing and shifting
uncontrollably from focused to unfocused, and
I became obsessed with doing something right
that had always been second nature for me. I
mean, I’d never worried about what to do with
my eyes before! Eventually, I just forgot about
them, and they never bothered me again.
To save you similar confusion about your eyes
and other salient body parts, I offer the follow-
ing guidelines:
Eyes: Initially, you need to decide whether you
want to sit with your eyes closed, wide open, or
half open. Then you can just forget about your
eyes and let them do what they do. Each alter-
native has its pros and cons.
Keeping your eyes closed draws your attention
away from external distractions and helps you
focus on your inner experience. Unfortunately, it
also encourages daydreaming and thinking.
Keeping your eyes wide open is actually the
most difficult position because it expands your
awareness to include the full range of outer as
well as inner experiences. The good news is that
this position makes it easier for you to rise from
a sitting position and extend your meditation to
your everyday, eyes-open activities. The bad
news is that if you haven’t developed enough
concentration, you can easily be distracted by
anything that crosses your field of vision.
I generally recommend that people sit with
eyes half open, Zen style, gazing with soft focus
at a spot on the floor about 4 or 5 feet in front
of them — in other words, looking down at a
45-degree angle. If you’re feeling restless or
distracted, you can close your eyes a little
more (or completely); if you’re feeling sleepy or
dull, you can open them wider. And if you find
yourself staring, just relax your eyes and soften
your focus.
Hands: You can put your hands pretty much
anywhere they feel comfortable, as long as you
keep them there for the entire sitting period.
Seasoned meditators generally put their hands
one of two places: in their laps or on their thighs.
 In your lap: Try simply clasping your hands.
Or you can attempt the more formal Zen
mudra (hand position) in which your left
palm is placed on top of your right about 4
or 5 inches below your navel, with your
thumbs lightly touching near your navel,
thereby forming an oval with your fingers.
 On your thighs: Simply rest your hands
there, palms down. Or turn them up and, if
you want, touch your index finger to the
thumb of each hand, forming an oval in a
traditional yoga mudra. As with all the other
options in this chapter, experiment until you
find the one that works best for you.
Mouth: Keep it gently closed (but not clenched)
as you breathe through your nose, with your
tongue lightly touching the roof of your mouth so
it doesn’t wander all over the place as tongues
are wont to do.

Zafus have infiltrated the meditation halls of every spiritual lineage and denom-
ination, from Sufis and Buddhists to Christian monastics (see Chapter 3 for
more about Sufis). Zafus are generally stuffed with kapok, which are silky nat-
ural fibers that keep their shape despite repeated sittings. But I’ve seen hefty
zafus filled with buckwheat husks or cotton batting and even thick rectangular
ones filled with hard polyurethane foam.
Before buying a zafu, be sure to try out a number of different shapes and
sizes, checking them for relative comfort, stability, and height. You want to be
able to sit so both knees touch the floor, if possible, and your pelvis tilts
slightly forward.
If you’re a kneeler, you can try sitting on a zafu or other convenient cushion
placed on the floor between your legs, or you can use one of the meditation
benches designed exclusively for the purpose. Again, experiment before buying.
If you’re a chair sitter, choose one with a firm cushion and a straight back — not
one of those plush armchairs into which you can comfortably disappear and
drift off. Just be sure your buttocks are somewhat higher than your knees.
Preparing Your Body for Sitting
If you can sit in meditation for 10 or 15 minutes each day without discomfort,
congratulations! You needn’t spend any additional time learning how to
stretch and strengthen your body — unless, that is, you’re so inclined.

Chapter 7: Preparing for Meditation: Posture, Stretching, and Sitting Still

But if you’re like most people, sooner or later your body will start clamoring
for your attention. For example, you may find that regular sitting causes your
back to stiffen occasionally. Or you may try to work your way into one of the
more challenging cross-legged poses — only to discover that your legs just
aren’t as flexible as you imagined.
A few well-placed hatha yoga poses can do wonders for your body — and make
sitting a whole lot more comfortable, too! (If you’re interested in finding out
more about yoga, try Yoga For Dummies, by Georg Feuerstein and Larry Payne
[Wiley].) Whichever sitting position you choose, you’ll enjoy it more if your
lower back is flexible and strong enough to support you without complaining.
And if you prefer to cross your legs, you’ll find that stretching your hips allows
you to sit with more stability and far less strain on your knees.
With these needs in mind, the following sections highlight six yoga poses
(also known as asanas) to help prepare you for sitting. The first three help to
stretch and strengthen your lower back; the second three work on opening
your hips and making them more flexible.
122
Part II: Getting Started 
Four tried-and-true meditation 
positions — plus a few more
If you can’t sit comfortably in any of the usual
sitting positions, you can take heart from the
Buddhist tradition, which offers four equally
acceptable alternatives for formal meditation:
 Sitting
 Standing
 Walking
 Lying down
Giant statues in India and Southeast Asia show
the Buddha himself meditating while lying on his
right side with his head cradled in his hand. Yogis
and ascetics have long meditated while stand-
ing, sometimes on one leg. And walking medita-
tion is still widely practiced throughout the world,
from the Zen monasteries of Japan and the
forest monasteries of Thailand to the Sufi com-
munities of the Middle East and the Christian her-
mitages of Europe and North America.
Of course, the Sufis recognize a fifth tradi-
tional posture — the spinning dance of the
dervishes — and the Taoists teach the martial
art t’ai chi as a moving meditation. In the West,
some of the followers of Swiss psychologist C.
G. Jung have developed a meditative form
known as authentic movement, and some
Christians practice walking in contemplation
around a spiral labyrinth. Ultimately, any activity
can become a meditation if you do it mindfully,
as I describe in Chapter 15.
At formal silent retreats, I’ve seen people med-
itating in wheelchairs, newcomers perched on
high cushions surrounded by bolsters, and old-
timers who do nothing but walk or lie down for
ten days. And I’ve seen a photo of the great
Indian yogi Swami Muktananda meditating
while roosting like a bird in a tree. The point is,
there’s no one right way to do it — just discover
what works for you.

When you’ve chosen the poses that seem best for you, be sure to practice
them gently and carefully, treating your body with the kindness you would
reserve for a close friend. Enjoy the stretch, but back off gently if you feel any
pain. (If you don’t have carpeting, use a yoga mat or a rug between your
tender parts and the floor.)
Cat pose with variations
Watch how a cat stretches after a nap, and you’ll understand how this pose
got its name. Not only does it stretch and strengthen your spine for sitting,
it’s also a great way to start your day. Try rolling out of bed first thing in the
morning, limbering up with the Cat pose, doing 10 or 15 minutes of medita-
tion, and then going about your day (see Figure 7-9).
Here’s how you practice the Cat:
1. Begin on your hands and knees with your spine horizontal and your
arms and thighs perpendicular to the floor (like a four-legged animal).
2. As you exhale, arch your spine upward slowly like a cat, beginning
the stretch at your tailbone.
Feel your spine flexing vertebra by vertebra.
3. At the culmination of the stretch, tuck your chin slightly.
Figure 7-9:

back like a

Chapter 7: Preparing for Meditation: Posture, Stretching, and Sitting Still

4. As you inhale, flex your spine downward, beginning with your tail-
bone and lifting your head slightly at the end of the stretch.
5. Continue to breathe and stretch in this way for 10 to 15 breaths.
You can also do two variations of the preceding Cat pose, as follows:
 Variation 1: From the four-legged position (Step 1), gently turn your
head on an exhalation and look at your left hip, as you simultaneously
move your hip toward your head. Inhale and come back to center and
repeat to the other side. Continue for 10 to 15 breaths.
 Variation 2: From the four-legged position (Step 1), move your hands
slightly forward of perpendicular and draw broad circles with your hips,
moving forward as you inhale and backward as you exhale. Continue for
10 to 15 breaths.
Cobra pose
Named for its resemblance to the graceful serpent, this asana provides a
great backward stretch for your spine — and an antidote to any tendency to
slouch forward. Instead of leading with (and possibly overarching) the lower
back, be sure to initiate the stretch in your upper back and gradually extend
it down your spine (see Figure 7-10).
To get the benefits of this stretch, do it this way:
1. Lie face down with your forehead on the floor.
2. Place your hands under your shoulders with your fingertips facing
forward and the outside edge of your hands even with the edge of
your shoulders.
3. Draw your elbows in so that your arms touch the sides of your torso.
Figure 7-10:

124
Part II: Getting Started 

4. Keep your feet together and press your legs and thighs into the floor.
5. Raise your chest slowly away from the floor, lifting and extending from
your upper back, with your head and neck in alignment with your spine.
At first, you may find that your chest doesn’t rise very far, but don’t
force yourself in any way. Your back will gradually become more flexible.
6. Keeping your shoulders relaxed, gently press your chest upward and
forward and open your abdomen while pressing your pubic bone into
the floor.
7. Breathe deeply and smoothly, holding the pose for five to ten full
breaths.
8. As you exhale, slowly unfold the pose, vertebra by vertebra, until
you’re once again lying face down with your forehead on the floor.
9. Turn your head to one side and relax completely.
Locust pose
Also named for an animal, this asana recalls a grasshopper with its abdomen
lifted into the air behind it (see Figure 7-11). Because it stretches and strength-
ens the lower back, the Locust pose provides crucial support for the practice
of sitting up straight, whether in meditation or any other sedentary activity.
Begin with the half Locust and graduate to the full Locust when your lower
back feels strong enough. (If you have lower-back problems or feel any pain
during half Locust, you should abstain from full Locust.) Move slowly and care-
fully and avoid any movement that causes you pain — except the dull ache of a
good stretch.
Here are the steps you follow to practice this pose:
1. Lie face down with your chin on the floor and your arms at your sides,
palms up.
Figure 7-11:
Imagine

legs like a

Chapter 7: Preparing for Meditation: Posture, Stretching, and Sitting Still

2. Making a partial fist with both hands, move your arms under your
body and position your hands under your pubic bone, thumbs lightly
touching.
3. At this point, you can do either the half Locust or the full Locust, as
follows:
• For half Locust: Contract your buttock muscles slightly and inhale.
As you exhale, lift one leg completely into the air without bending
your knee. Hold for five to ten breaths; then lower your leg and do
the same with the other leg. Repeat three or four times on each
side. When you’re done, turn your head to one side and relax.
• For full Locust: Contract your buttock muscles slightly and inhale.
As you exhale, lift both legs completely into the air without bend-
ing your knees. Hold the pose for five to ten breaths, breathing
deeply into your abdomen; then lower your legs, turn your head to
one side, and relax.
Lunge pose
Billed as a back stretch, this asana also opens your hips and groin (see 
Figure 7-12). If you have time for a only few poses, combine this one with the
Cat pose and Butterfly pose (see the following section) for a mini routine.
Figure 7-12:

Part II: Getting Started 

Follow these steps and enjoy the stretch:
1. Begin on your hands and knees with your spine horizontal and your
arms and thighs perpendicular to the floor (like a four-legged animal).
2. Move your left knee forward and place your left lower leg on the floor
with your heel close to your right groin.
3. Extend your right leg straight behind you with your knee facing 
downward.
4. Sink your pubic bone toward the floor, while lifting your chest gently
upward and forward with your weight on your arms and right leg.
Make sure that any torque in your bent leg occurs in the hip joint, not
the knee. Feel the stretch in your lower back, in the hip joint of your
bent leg, and in the groin, hip, and thigh of your straight leg.
5. Hold the stretch for five to ten breaths; then repeat on the other side.
Butterfly pose
Especially challenging for runners and other athletes, this pose stretches the
inner thigh, groin, and hip. As its shape suggests, it gradually opens your
“wings” and helps your knees reach the floor in cross-legged poses (see
Figure 7-13).
Do the stretch like this:
1. Sit on the floor with your legs extended in front of you.
If you have difficulty keeping your back straight, place a small cushion
under your buttocks so that your pelvis tilts forward slightly.
2. Bend your knees and bring the soles of your feet together with the
outside edges of both feet on the floor.
3. Clasping your hands together, grasp both feet, draw your heels in
toward your groin, and gently press your knees toward the floor
while extending your spine.
Feel the stretch in your groin, thighs, hips, and lower back. Resist the
temptation to bounce or force your legs. If your knees stick up in the air,
don’t worry. It’s more important to keep your back straight than to
touch the floor with your knees.
4. Hold the stretch for five to ten breaths while breathing deeply into
your abdomen.
5. As you exhale, release your feet, extend your legs in front of you, and
relax.

Cradle stretch
As the name may suggest, you cradle your leg in your arms as you would a
baby, stretching and opening your hips in the process (see Figure 7-14). Be
sure to lift your leg slowly and gently — remember, you’re stretching, not
wrenching.

Ten quick steps to prep your body for meditation
This handy list provides a user-friendly summary
of the steps described in detail earlier in this
chapter:
1. Arrange your legs.
2. Lengthen your spine.
3. Rock your body from side to side like a 
pendulum.
4. Rock your body from front to back.
5. Tilt your pelvis slightly forward and soften
your belly.
6. Tuck your chin gently.
7. Rest your tongue on the roof of your mouth
and breathe through your nose, if possible.
8. Rest your hands on your thighs or in 
your lap.
9. Relax your body from head to toe, letting 
go as much as possible of any tension or
discomfort.
10. Begin your meditation.

Follow these instructions with the careful attention of a loving mother:
1. Sit on the floor with your legs extended in front of you.
2. Bend one knee, rotate your thigh to the side, and cradle your lower
leg in your arms. Keeping your hands clasped, hold your knee in the
crease of one elbow and your foot in the crease of the other.
3. Keeping your spine extended and your head erect, gently rock your
leg horizontally from side to side, rotating at your hip.
4. Continue this rocking motion for five to ten breaths, breathing deeply
and smoothly; then gently put your leg down the same way you
picked it up and do the same stretch with the other leg.

Keeping good head and shoulders
In Zen, good posture refers to more than how you
position your back and legs; it refers to an atti-
tude toward life in general. Attentive yet relaxed,
you face each moment and each situation
directly, with a bearing that suggests: “I’m open
to whatever arises. I’m present and ready to
respond.” One of my teachers, the Tibetan med-
itation master Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche, used
to call this “keeping good head and shoulders.”
If you have an alarm watch, set it to beep every
hour for the rest of the day. (If you don’t, just do
this exercise at random times.) When your
watch beeps, take a moment to pay attention to
your body. How am I standing or sitting right
now? Am I slouching or slumping? And if so,
how would it feel to gently extend my spine and
align myself with gravity?
Notice how this subtle shift affects your mood
and your outlook on life as you go about your day.

W
hen I began meditating in college, I took the subway once a week from
my uptown apartment to the little Zen center on Manhattan’s East
Side. Each time I entered the front door, the smell of incense, the Japanese
straw mats, the simple altar, and the dark robes of the members all reminded
me that I had entered a special place — a place devoted to the practice of
meditation. I could feel my breath deepening and my mind slowing down —
and I was frustrated to find that I couldn’t translate the quality of meditation I
experienced there to the cramped little flat I shared with three friends.
Over the years, I’ve learned that the physical environment surrounding your
meditation — where, when, and how long you sit, what you wear, what kind
of energy you invest — can have a powerful impact on the quality of your
meditation. Trying to count your breaths in a busy airport or a noisy office
can be an enjoyable challenge, of course, but you’ll go deeper faster in a
quiet place that’s specifically devoted to meditation.
You may fantasize about going off to an ashram or some other spiritual com-
munity where everything is conveniently taken care of and all you have to do
is meditate, eat, and sleep. Such places do exist, of course, and you may be
lucky enough to find one. But if the circumstances of your life don’t allow for
time away, you may just have to carve the time and space for meditation out
of the raw material of your busy life. That’s why I wrote this chapter.

In these pages, you’ll find out how to choose just the right spot for your med-
itation, get some guidelines for determining when and how long to sit, and
pick up a few pointers for setting up an altar that will inspire your efforts.
Creating and maintaining your own meditation niche is the next best thing to
meditating in a monastery. (For more about meditating with others, turn to
Chapter 15.)
What to Wear: Choosing Comfort 
over Fashion
This one may seem like a no-brainer, but you’d be surprised how many
people show up for meditation wearing designer jeans and skin-tight tops,
which makes it virtually impossible for them to breathe or cross their legs.
The key to comfortable sitting is this: Keep clothing loose and roomy and
avoid constricting your breathing or your circulation in any way. Sweat
clothes generally make great sitting gear. If you’re into meditation chic, you
can buy a pair of sleek but comfortable draw-string pants in a variety of
colors and materials from a mail-order catalog.
Because body temperature and blood pressure tend to drop during medita-
tion, you may get chillier than usual. So be sure to have a sweater or woolen
blanket nearby as a wrap.
132
Part II: Getting Started 
Meditating with music
When you’re moving too fast to sit and be mind-
ful, you can use certain kinds of music to help
you tune in to a slower, steadier, less jarring
rhythm before you begin meditating. The music
you choose depends on your taste — one
person’s “aaahh” is another one’s “ouch.”
Some people relax to classical or jazz, while
others seem to need the intense sounds of
heavy metal or the staccato rhythms of rap
before their bodies settle down.
By all means, use a favorite CD to soothe your
savage beast at the end of a long and stressful
day — preferably something that joins you
where you are and then gradually lulls you into
a quieter space. When you’re breathing a little
easier, you can head for your meditation corner.
Or you can make listening to music a meditation
in itself. Begin by being mindful of the music the
way you’d be mindful of your breathing. Instead
of thinking or daydreaming, listen with full atten-
tion to the sounds as they unfold in your aware-
ness. When your mind wanders off, return to the
music. At times, you may even lose yourself in
the sound so that you, as the listener, disappear
and only the listening remains. Such moments of
deep meditation offer a glimpse of your essential
being that can’t be understood by the mind, but
they have a powerful effect nevertheless.

When to Meditate: Any Time’s 
the Right Time
If you’re incredibly busy, pencil in formal periods of meditation whenever you
can find the time. But if you have the luxury of choosing or would like to med-
itate as often as you can, I fill you in on some of the best times to sit in the fol-
lowing sections.
Ultimately, every moment and every activity can provide an opportunity to
be mindful. (For more on mindfulness in everyday life, see Chapter 15.)
First thing in the morning
Traditionally, the hour or two right after you wake up — preferably around
sunrise — is considered the best time to meditate. Your mind and body are
refreshed and energized by deep sleep, and you haven’t yet started to obsess
about your usual worries and concerns. As a result, you may find it easier to
focus and stay present. By meditating first thing, you also set the tone for the
rest of the day and can extend whatever peace of mind you generate to your
other activities.
Before bed
Some people take an hour or two to wake up from the dreamy fog of sleep,
and others have just enough time to roll out of bed, grab a cup of coffee, and
rush out to join the morning commute. If you’re groggy when you get up or
have to switch to high gear the moment your feet hit the floor, try meditating
in the evening before bed. It’s a great way to prepare for sleep, because it
allows your mind to settle down and shift naturally and with ease from
waking to slumber. In fact, meditators who sit at bedtime often report that
their sleep is more restful and they need less of it.
Of course, the downside is that you may feel as though you’re too tired or
stressed out to meditate at the end of the day — and you may wind up taking
a hot bath or watching TV instead. But when you get into the habit, you’ll
find that evening meditations are an excellent option with some distinct
advantages of their own.
Right after work
Though not as reliable as mornings or bedtimes because it’s often usurped
by errands, early dinners, or family emergencies, the transition between work
133
Chapter 8: Where to Sit, What to Wear, and Other Practical Stuff

and home can be a fitting moment to take a few deep breaths and let your body
and mind settle — instead of reaching for the paper or flipping on the tube.
Lunch hours and coffee breaks
If you have an office of your own and a time set aside for lunch or coffee — 
a big if, because more and more people eat on the fly these days — plan on
bringing your food or scoring your java in advance and spending the rest of
the time meditating. You might even set aside a special space in your office —
including an altar, if you’re so inclined.
While waiting for your kids and 
at other predictable downtimes
If you’re like many parents, you may spend hours each week shuttling your
kids from one activity or playdate to another — and sitting in the car or run-
ning errands while you wait for them to finish. Instead of picking up a maga-
zine or listening to the news, try meditating. (You can take the same approach
to waiting for your doctor or dentist.) It may not be the best environment and
your posture may not be ideal, but look — it’s a stretch of precious idle time.
Use it wisely.
How Long to Meditate: From 
Quickies to the Long Haul
Meditation resembles sex in a number of ways, and this is one of them: You
may prefer it short and quick or long and slow. But whatever your predilec-
tions, you would probably agree that some sexual contact with your beloved
is better than no sex at all.
Well, apply this dictum to meditation, and you’ll get the drift. If you can’t sched-
ule a half-hour, then meditate for a few minutes. Sitting for five or ten minutes
every day is much better than sitting for an hour once a week — though you
may want to do both. As with all the guidelines in this book, experiment with
the different options until you find the one that suits you best.
Digital alarm watches provide an accurate and inexpensive way to time your
meditations precisely without watching the clock. Also, you may want to
signal the beginning and end of your meditation with the sound of a small
bell, as is done in many traditional cultures.
134
Part II: Getting Started 

Five minutes
If you’re a beginner, a few minutes can seem like an eternity, so start off
slowly and increase the length of your sittings as your interest and enjoyment
dictate. You may find that, by the time you settle your body and start to focus
on your breath, your time is up. If the session seems too short, you can
always sit a little longer next time. As your practice develops, you’ll find that
even five minutes can be immeasurably refreshing.
10 to 15 minutes
If you’re like most people, you need several minutes at the start of meditation
to get settled, a few more minutes to become engaged in the process, and
135
Chapter 8: Where to Sit, What to Wear, and Other Practical Stuff
Walking meditation
Between periods of formal sitting, meditators
throughout the world have long practiced walk-
ing with mindful awareness. Besides breaking
the monotony of uninterrupted sitting, it’s a
great meditation in its own right — and a won-
derful way to practice extending the mindful-
ness you learn on your cushion or chair into the
ordinary world of movement and activity.
In some Zen monasteries, walking meditation
more closely resembles a kind of restrained,
conscious running. In parts of Southeast Asia,
the movement may be almost imperceptibly
slow. Here’s a more moderate approach that
you can practice not only between periods of
sitting meditation, but also anytime you want to
slow down a little and pay attention as you walk.
If the weather allows, by all means walk out-
side. Or you can just walk back and forth in your
house. (For detailed audio instructions, listen to
Track 6 on the CD.)
1. Begin by walking at your usual pace, fol-
lowing your in-breath and out-breath as
you walk.
2. Coordinate your breathing with your steps.
For example, you can take three steps for
each inhalation and three steps for each
exhalation — which, as you may notice, is
considerably slower than most people walk.
If you want to change the speed of your
walking, just change the number of steps
per breath. But maintain the same pace
each time you walk. (If your inhalations and
exhalations are different lengths, just adapt
your walking accordingly.)
3. In addition to your breathing, be aware of
your feet and legs as you lift and move them.
Notice the contact of your feet with the
ground or floor. Gaze ahead of you, with
your eyes lowered at a 45-degree angle. Be
relaxed, easy, and comfortable as you walk.
4. Enjoy your steady, mindful walking for as
long as you want.
If your attention wanders or you start to
hurry, gently bring your attention back to
your walking.

several minutes at the end to reorient — which means that 10 or 15 minutes
leaves you a little in the middle to deepen your concentration or expand your
awareness.
When you’ve made it this far, try leveling off at 15 minutes a day for several
weeks, and watch how your powers of concentration build.
20 minutes to an hour
The longer you sit, the more time you’ll have between preliminaries and end-
ings to settle into a focused and relaxed state of mind. If you have the motiva-
tion and can carve out the time, by all means devote 20 minutes, 40 minutes,
or an hour to meditation each day. You’ll notice the difference — and you’ll
understand why most meditation teachers recommend sitting this long at a
stretch. Perhaps it’s the human attention span — look at the proverbial 50-
minute hour of psychotherapy or the optimal length for most TV shows.
Keeping your practice steady and regular is better than splurging one day
and abstaining for the rest of the week.
136
Part II: Getting Started 
Why bother to time your meditations?
You’re welcome to experiment with sitting down
to meditate when you feel like it and getting up
when you’re done. But there are some excellent
reasons for deciding when and how long before
you begin meditating and then sticking to your
plan:
 Your mind is seductive. If you don’t make a
commitment to stay put for a certain period
of time, your mind will find all kinds of com-
pelling reasons for you to get up and do
other things. Instead, you can watch your
mind go through its gyrations, without being
seduced.
 You can forget about the clock. When you
decide how long you’re going to sit, you don’t
have to obsess about the time anymore —
and you can relax and concentrate on your
practice instead.
 You can develop regularity. Like building a
muscle, you can begin with 5 minutes and
gradually work up to 15 or 20 minutes. In the
same way, sitting at the same time every
day creates a natural circadian rhythm to
your meditation, which makes it easier to
keep going.

What to Eat and Drink before You
Meditate — and What to Avoid
Big meals can make you drowsy, especially when they’re high in carbohy-
drates, so eat lightly if at all before you sit. Or wait at least one hour after a
major repast. You might even consider following the traditional Zen guideline
to eat until you’re two-thirds full, instead of bursting at the seams — it may
not be bad for your waistline, either.
As for drinking (and smoking), here are a few suggestions: I do know sea-
soned meditators who like to down a cup of cappuccino before they sit, and
at least one Zen master who made it a habit of meditating first thing in the
morning after drinking too much sake the night before. But as a general rule,
abstaining from mind-altering substances (for example, coffee, alcohol,
tobacco, marijuana, and other recreational drugs) before meditating is best.
137
Chapter 8: Where to Sit, What to Wear, and Other Practical Stuff
Meditation and TV: From the couch to the cushion
I have to confess that I’m one of those reac-
tionary people who cheer every time they see
the bumper sticker “Kill your TV.” Here’s why.
Not only does television inundate you with dis-
turbing images you wouldn’t otherwise have to
endure — images of conflict, cruelty, seduction,
exploitation, and outright violence that leave a
deep and lasting impression — but TV also dulls
your mind by habituating it to nonstop stimula-
tion. With your mind accustomed to being
flooded with images and sounds, you find it
more difficult to enjoy the ordinary moments of
everyday life or to register subtler levels of
experience — the kind you’re trying to access
in meditation.
Studies have also shown that tube-time inhibits
the natural, age-appropriate development and
integration of the various lobes of the brain.
Children who grow up on lots of TV are gener-
ally less imaginative, more restless, more
aggressive, and more easily bored than those
who don’t. Did you ever wonder why so many
teenagers hang around shopping malls looking
listless and brain-dead? Television may be the
answer.
Needless to say, you’re doing yourself a favor
when you substitute an hour on the meditation
cushion for an hour on the couch. You’re more
likely to find what you’re looking for — relax-
ation, happiness, joy, peace of mind. And you’ll
come away more refreshed and more open to
new experiences, both inner and outer.
But like most addictions, a TV fixation can be
hard to kick. Start out slowly, say, by giving up a
few hours each week and substituting some
other activity that you find genuinely nurturing
or fulfilling — going for a walk, talking with a
friend, spending quality time with your family. Of
course, you may not want to give up your
favorite sitcom, the Sunday game, or the
evening news — but then, who knows?

As your practice grows and you observe the benefits of being present and
focused, rather than zoned out or drugged up, you may naturally diminish
your intake. In fact, you may discover that meditation makes you more sensi-
tive to your state of mind and provides a natural high that renders these sub-
stances unnecessary or obsolete. And if your primary motivation for
meditating is to reduce stress or enhance your health, you may consider
abstaining entirely from your substance of choice. Believe it or not, indulging
only adds to the burden of stress you’re already experiencing.
Where to Meditate: Creating 
Sacred Space
Perhaps you’ve seen those Chinese paintings where a bearded sage in a flow-
ing robe sits in deep contemplation at the base of some majestic peak with a
waterfall thundering beside him. Maybe you’ve even had moments when you
wished you could become that sage, disappear into the mountains, and medi-
tate in silence and simplicity for the rest of your days. Alas, life doesn’t usu-
ally support us nowadays in actualizing such fantasies!
Instead of shaving your head and heading for the hills, however, you can
follow a few simple guidelines for carving out a special place for the practice
138
Part II: Getting Started 
Meditating in nature
As you may already have noticed, the natural
world has an unparalleled capacity to relax your
body and calm your mind. When you’re sitting
by the ocean listening to the surf or hiking in the
mountains among the rocks and trees, you don’t
have to practice some formal meditation tech-
nique — just open your senses and let nature
work its magic. Without any effort on your part,
you begin to feel your mind settle down, your
worries dissipate, your breathing deepen and
slow, your tension melt away, and your heart fill
with gratitude and love.
As a species, we evolved in the natural world,
and the plants and animals have been teaching
us how to meditate for as long as we’ve had
legs to cross. When you meditate in nature,
you’ve arrived where you belong, and the ease
and familiarity you feel there invites you to
return home to yourself, to your innermost
“nature.” (How fascinating and appropriate that
the words are the same!) Entering a natural set-
ting can stop your mind in its tracks, causing
you to sense the presence of something deeper
and more meaningful.
Make it a point to meditate in nature as often as
you can, and take note of the state of mind and
heart that it evokes. Even if you live in the inner
city, you can usually find some park or garden
or small patch of woods or water. Then, when
you meditate at home again, you can invoke the
resonance of your moments in nature to help
you deepen your practice.

of meditation. You’ll find that the space you set aside will enrich your life in
ways you can’t imagine.
Why it’s best to stay put
Just as it helps to have a regular time to meditate, there are some definite
advantages to sitting in the same location day after day, instead of moving
from place to place. These include
 Fewer distractions: As a beginner, you already have plenty of distrac-
tions to contend with, both inner and outer. Why add all the nuances of
a constantly shifting external environment? Once you get used to seeing
those little stains on the carpet and those cracks in the paint, you can
free up your attention for the matter at hand: meditation.
 Good vibes: The more often you sit there, the more you infuse your spot
and its environs with the energy of your efforts — your good vibes, if
you will. Whenever you return, your meditation is buoyed and sup-
ported by the energy you’ve invested, just as you feel especially com-
fortable and relaxed in your favorite chair.
 Peaceful memories: When you’ve picked your spot, you start associat-
ing it with meditation, especially if you keep your altar or your sitting
gear there. Just passing it on your way to other activities reminds you to
come back to meditate when you next have a chance. And if your medi-
tation involves spiritual aspirations, your spot becomes a sacred site
where your deepest insights and reflections take place.
How to pick the right spot
If you share a small apartment with a partner or friend, or your family has
usurped every square foot of usable space at your house, by all means
choose the only vacant corner and make it your own. If you have more
leeway, here are a few guidelines for picking your spot. And remember, even a
modest patch of floor that meets these criteria is better than a sumptuous
suite that doesn’t:
 Off the beaten track: You know the heavily trafficked highways in your
house, so be sure to avoid them. And if you don’t want someone inad-
vertently barging in on you just when you’re starting to settle, tell your
housemates you’re going off to meditate — they’ll understand. And if
they don’t . . . well, that’s another issue you may eventually have to face.
 Away from work: If you work at home or have a desk devoted to per-
sonal business, keep it out of sight — and mind — when you’re meditat-
ing. And if possible, remember to shut off your phone; there’s nothing
139
Chapter 8: Where to Sit, What to Wear, and Other Practical Stuff

quite as distracting to your mind as wondering who’s trying to reach
you now!
 Relatively quiet: Especially if you live in the city, you probably won’t be
able to eliminate the usual background noises — the drone of traffic, the
shouts and laughter of kids on the street, the hum of the refrigerator. But
you should, if at all possible, avoid audible conversations, especially
among people you know, and the sounds of TV, radio, popular music,
and other familiar distractions. These are the kinds of recognizable
noises that can pull your mind away from its appointed task, especially
when you’re just starting out.
 Not too dark or too light: Sitting in a bright, sunny spot may be too
energizing and distracting, just as sitting in the dark can put you to
sleep. Be sure to modulate the lighting with your attention level in mind:
If you’re sleepy, open the blinds or turn on an extra light; if you’re wired,
tone down the illumination accordingly.
 Fresh air: Because we’re talking breath here, it’s great to have a supply
of fresh air where you meditate. Avoid musty basements and windowless
closets; besides being bad for your health, they tend to lower your
energy (along with your O2 level) and lull you to sleep.
 Close to nature: If you don’t have a tree or a garden outside the window
near where you meditate, you may want to have a plant or a vase full of
flowers or a few stones nearby. Not that you’ll be gazing at them while
you sit, but natural objects radiate a certain special energy of their own
that lends support to your practice. Besides, you can pick up a few
pointers by watching how rocks and trees meditate — they’ve been
doing it a lot longer than we have. (See the sidebar “Meditating in
nature” earlier in this chapter.)
How to set up an altar — and 
why you may want to bother
For many people, the word altar is fraught with associations. Maybe you have
memories of being an altar boy as a kid — or you recall altars you’ve seen on
special occasions like weddings or funerals or memorial services.
For the purposes of this book, I use altar to refer to a collection of objects
with special meaning and resonance for you that you assemble in one place
and use to inspire your meditations. If you’re a Christian, for example, your
altar may include a crucifix or a picture of Jesus; if you’re a Jew, you may
have a holy book or a Star of David; or, if you’re a Buddhist, you may choose
to contemplate a statue of Buddha or a photo of your teacher. And if you
have no particular religious inclinations, you may be quite content with a few
stones, a candle, and a potted plant.
140
Part II: Getting Started 

Although an altar is not essential to meditation, it can be a creative and con-
stantly evolving expression of your inner life, a reflection of your deepest aspi-
rations, values, and beliefs. Gazing at your altar before you sit can evoke your
connection to a spiritual dimension of being — or it can merely remind you of
why you’re here: to develop concentration, relax, open your heart, heal your
body. Here are some of the main ingredients that appear on many altars (see
Figure 8-1); feel free to improvise and add or subtract as you see fit:
 Bells
 Candles
 Flowers
 Incense
 Natural objects
 Pictures (of nature or inspirational figures)
 Sacred texts
 Statues (of inspirational figures)
Some traditions recommend that altars appeal to all the senses — hence, the
incense, bells, flowers, and candles, which are mainstays on many home
altars. In particular, the fragrance of your favorite incense can quickly
become hyperlinked in your brain with meditation, causing you to relax just a
little whenever you smell it.
Figure 8-1:
Use an altar
to inspire
your
meditation.
141
Chapter 8: Where to Sit, What to Wear, and Other Practical Stuff

As with your meditation, it’s best to keep your altar simple at first. Use a
small, low table or cabinet (if you meditate on the floor) covered with a spe-
cial piece of cloth. If you want, you can enrich and expand it over time, or you
may prefer to keep a stash of objects and rotate them as the spirit moves you.
For example, you can adapt your altar to the seasons, with flowers in spring,
seashells in summer, dried leaves in autumn, pine boughs in winter, and so on.
One cautionary note about pictures: You may want to devote your altar to men-
tors, teachers, and other figures whose presence fills you with unadulterated
inspiration — and consign to your desk or bureau those loved ones for whom
your feelings may be more complex, like children, parents, spouses, and friends.
142
Part II: Getting Started 
Which direction should I face?
If you meditate with your eyes closed, it doesn’t
really matter which way your body is pointed.
But if you keep your eyes open, you’re better off
avoiding busy, distracting views. For example,
Zen monks (in certain traditions, anyway) usu-
ally sit facing a wall. Or you can gaze out on a
relaxing, natural vista, if you have one, or just
face your altar, with its attractive array of mean-
ingful objects. Whatever you see when you
meditate, make sure it’s simple and contributes
to your peace of mind.
Finding the beauty
Even in the most chaotic and unappealing situ-
ations, you can attune yourself to a quality or
dimension of beauty, if you try. Imagine that your
mind is like a CD player, and you’re trying to tune
in to a particular track. Or take one of those
figure-ground puzzles. At first, you can’t even
perceive the shape in the background. But as
soon as you’ve seen it, you merely need to shift
your awareness to see it again.
So, the next time you find yourself in an unpleas-
ant place or circumstance — preferably not one
with a strong emotional charge, because that
might make this exercise too difficult — do the
following:
1. Take a moment to look for the beauty.
You may notice a patch of green grass in the
distance, or a bouquet of flowers on a table,
or the laughter of a child, or an aesthetically
pleasing piece of furniture. Or you may just
notice a warm feeling in your belly or heart.
2. Take a deep breath, set aside your stress
and discomfort, and enjoy the beauty.
Allow yourself to resonate with it for a few
moments as you would with a favorite piece
of music or a walk in the woods.
3. Shift your focus back to the situation at
hand and notice whether your attitude has
changed in any way.
Know that you can shift your awareness in
this way whenever you feel inclined.

Chapter 9
Effort, Discipline, and Letting Go
In This Chapter
 How to develop great meditation habits without getting uptight
 The secret to having more energy, in meditation and in life
 The three aspects of discipline and the five stages of letting go
A
s I mention in previous chapters, meditation has quite a bit in common
with sports. First you have to learn the mechanics — how to sit up
straight, position your legs, relax your body, and focus on your breath. Then
you need to understand the rules of the game — how long it takes, where you
should practice, what you should wear. But when you’re clear on the details,
you need to know how to apply yourself so you can get the most from what
you’ve discovered.
Say that you want to run a marathon and you get some expert coaching on
the fundamentals of running. Then you start jogging 3 or 4 miles every day.
The next step is to figure out how to work with your mind and your body so
you can go the distance without exhausting yourself completely. You have to
master some intangible inner qualities like discipline, effort, and a certain
ease or comfort in your execution — qualities that can’t really be taught, only
described and evoked.
Well, the same is true for meditation. Discipline grabs you by the collar and
sits you down day after day, even when the going gets tough. Effort keeps
focusing your mind and bringing it back again and again to your breath or
your mantra (or some other object of meditation). And letting go allows you
to relax and open to whatever you’re experiencing, no matter how challeng-
ing or difficult. Discovering how to apply these three ingredients to the prac-
tice of meditation is just what this chapter is all about.

Discipline Just Means 
“Again and Again”
If you’re like most folks, the word discipline may be a bit of a turnoff. Perhaps it
reminds you of some bossy teacher who made you stay after school or child-
hood punishments that were intended to “set you straight.” Or maybe you asso-
ciate discipline with soldiers marching single-file or with prisoners forced to
obey their keepers. But the discipline I’m talking about here is quite different.
When I say discipline, I mean the kind of self-discipline that prompts top ath-
letes like Tiger Woods or Venus Williams to get up every morning and run
several miles and then practice their moves or their shots over and over, long
after they’ve gotten them right. It’s the kind of self-discipline that motivates
great writers to sit at their computers each day, no matter how they feel, and
pound out their copy.
The truth is, you already have self-discipline, though you may not be aware 
of it. You need self-discipline to get to your job on time or to orchestrate a
schedule filled with business commitments, personal interests, and family
responsibilities. You need self-discipline to pay your bills or keep up a garden
or take care of your kids. You merely need to apply the same self-discipline to
the practice of meditation.
Again, self-discipline is nothing more than the capacity to do something again
and again. But I find it helpful to break self-discipline down a little further into
three parts: commitment, consistency, and self-restraint.
Making a commitment to yourself — 
and keeping it
When you commit to marriage or some other monogamous relationship, you
make an agreement with yourself and your partner to stay together through
thick and thin, no matter what life brings. Without this commitment, you may
be tempted to leave when your partner becomes angry or does something
you can’t stand — or when you find yourself withdrawing or “falling out of
love.” Of course, you can always decide to end the relationship, but as long
as you’re committed, you’re going to do all you can to maintain it.
The same holds true for meditation. Commitment is the foundation for your
meditation practice. Without commitment, you won’t keep meditating when
you’re tired, have a headache, don’t feel like it, would rather do something
else, or run up against some of the roadblocks I cover in Chapter 12.
And what prompts you to make the commitment to meditate in the first
place? You have to be motivated (see Chapter 4), which means you have to
144
Part II: Getting Started 

know how you can benefit from what meditation has to offer (see Chapter 2),
and you must have strong personal reasons for continuing. These reasons
may include a desire to alleviate personal suffering or stress, an aspiration to
achieve greater focus and clarity, and a concern for the welfare of others.
The commitment process usually involves five distinct steps — though it
doesn’t necessarily have to be so formal:
 Becoming motivated: Ouch, life hurts! I need to find out how to deal
with my pain.
 Setting your intention: I know, I’ll meditate for 30 minutes every day!
 Making an agreement with yourself: From now until the end of the month,
I agree to get up at 7 a.m. and count my breaths before I go to work.
 Following through: Whew! I didn’t realize how hard it would be to sit
still for so long — but I refuse to break my agreement with myself!
 Gaining momentum: Wow! The more I meditate, the easier it gets. I’m
really beginning to enjoy it.
Being consistent, day after day
Take sports again. If you train for a day and then slack off for a week, you
won’t make much progress. In fact, you may end up straining a muscle or
hurting your back because you haven’t conditioned your body gradually, as
most fitness gurus recommend.
When you practice meditation, you’re developing certain mental and emo-
tional muscles like concentration, mindfulness (ongoing attention to whatever
is arising, moment to moment), and receptive awareness. (See Chapter 1 for
more about these mental and emotional “muscles.”) Here, too, consistency is
the key — you need to keep it up and keep it regular, no matter how you’re
feeling from day to day. In fact, your feelings provide the fodder for your med-
itation practice, as you expand your awareness from your breath to include
the full range of your experience. There’s no special way you need to be —
just show up and be yourself!
As one old Chinese Zen master used to say, “Sun-faced Buddha, moon-faced
Buddha” — by which he meant, happy or sad, energetic or tired, just sit as
the being you happen to be.
Be especially wary of two extremes: laziness or self-indulgence (“I’d rather be
sleeping, resting, watching TV”) and perfectionism (“I’m not ready to medi-
tate. I’m not smart or good or focused enough.”) Remember, I’m talking about
meditation for beginners here — and besides, the best way to become “good
enough” to meditate is to just do it!

Chapter 9: Effort, Discipline, and Letting Go

Restraining yourself, both on 
and off the cushion
Broadly speaking, self-restraint is the quality of mind that keeps you from
acting on every impulse or desire that flits through your brain and that helps
you discriminate between behavior that’s useful and supportive and behavior
that’s unsupportive or even harmful. If you’re an athlete, you need self-
restraint to prevent you from eating junk food or staying out late when you’re
training for a big competition. If you’re a meditator, self-restraint can function
on several different levels:
 Before meditation: You may choose to eat well and in moderation or
avoid mind-altering substances such as tobacco or caffeine because you
want to keep your mind clear and fresh for your meditation.
 During meditation: You can use self-restraint to keep pulling your mind
back from its habitual fantasies and preoccupations to the object of your
meditation, be it your breath or a mantra or some other focus. Be care-
ful, however, not to confuse self-restraint with repression, avoidance, or
judgment. You don’t need to criticize yourself for wandering off, nor do
you want to push certain “undesirable” thoughts or feelings out of your
mind. Instead, just welcome whatever arises, while gently returning your
focus to the object of your meditation.
 After meditation: As your practice deepens and strengthens, you build a
certain power or energy of mind — in the East they call it samadhi. (For
more on energy, see the section “The Right Kind of Effort: Not Too Tight

Part II: Getting Started 
If you don’t dig sports, try gardening
Although meditating has a lot in common with
practicing and playing a sport, for some folks,
meditating may be more akin to gardening. After
you plant the seeds, you don’t try to force the
seedlings out of the ground, do you? You just
water and fertilize, thin and water some more,
and eventually the little shoots appear on their
own, coaxed into the light by some complex and
mysterious mixture of chemistry, genetics, pho-
totropism, and who knows what else.
The point is, you don’t have to know — you just
have to do your part and get out of the way! If
you get carried away and overwater or disturb
the ground prematurely, you only interfere with
the process.
In the same way, you need to exert just the right
amount of consistent effort in your meditation —
don’t overwater or keep scratching the ground
searching for signs of progress, but don’t go
away for a week and leave your plot unattended,
either. Do what you need to do without fixating
on the results, and your garden will blossom
quite naturally, all by itself.

or Too Loose.”) You can blow off this energy by daydreaming or plan-
ning or obsessing — or you can use self-restraint to channel your energy
back into your practice of being mindful from moment to moment.
Like self-discipline, self-restraint has a bad rap in our culture. After all, aren’t
you supposed to say what you think and do what feels right? But what feels
right in the moment may not be the same as what feels right in the long run —
and self-restraint is the faculty that helps you distinguish between the two.
For example, you may be tempted to charge those plane tickets to Hawaii
because it feels right, but you may have different feelings altogether when
you get your credit card statement. In the same way, it may feel great to
spend your meditation indulging in fantasy — until you start wondering in a
month or two why you still can’t count your breaths from one to ten. Above
all, though, remember to be gentle with yourself!
The Right Kind of Effort: Not 
Too Tight or Too Loose
If discipline is the capacity to keep doing something again and again, then effort
is the quality of energy and exertion you bring to the activity itself. Although it
may take discipline to show up at the gym every day, it takes effort to do those
aerobics or lift those weights or shoot those hoops. I’m sure you know what
I’m talking about! As with self-discipline, you may find it helpful to break effort
into three convenient parts: energy, earnestness, and effortless effort.
Giving your energy 100 percent
There’s a secret “law of energy” that applies just as well to meditation as it
does to sports — and to life in general: The more you expend, the more you
get back in return. You can be stingy about your energy, parceling it out from
one activity to the next as though you have just so much to give and no more.
But if you love something and give yourself to it wholeheartedly, you may
notice that the energy just feeds on itself and keeps growing and growing.
In the NBA finals one year, Michael Jordan was suffering from an intestinal flu
so severe that he needed fluid IVs and could barely stand. Yet, carried aloft
by his own dedication (what he called “heart”) and fueled by an energy that
seemed drawn from a source far vaster than his own exhausted body, he
suited up for his team and scored 38 points. Jordan embodied the quality of
wholeheartedness.
In meditation, too, the more wholeheartedly you practice, the more you tap
into a seemingly limitless energy source. It’s as though the flame inside your
147
Chapter 9: Effort, Discipline, and Letting Go

heart begins channeling the fusion energy that runs the sun. But don’t con-
fuse wholeheartedness with struggle; when you meditate, remember to relax
and open while you focus your mind. It’s this unique balance of active and
receptive, yang and yin, that characterizes the practice of meditation. (For
more on this balance, see the section, “Making an effortless effort.”)
Applying yourself “earnestly”
Where self-restraint keeps you from doing what might be harmful or
unhealthy and wholeheartedness supplies the spark that ignites your medita-
tion, earnestness keeps bringing your mind back to your focus. No matter
what thoughts or feelings arise to seduce you away, you just keep plugging
along — following your breaths or chanting your mantra or paying mindful
attention in everyday life. Just as it takes consistency to return to your sitting
day after day, it takes earnest application to return to the focus of your medi-
tation moment after moment, without struggling or giving up. Earnestness
isn’t sexy or exciting — it’s just essential! (Perhaps this is what Oscar Wilde
meant by The Importance of Being Earnest.)
Making an effortless effort
When I was a neophyte meditator, one of my teachers, the Zen master Shunryu
Suzuki, used to say somewhat mysteriously, “Follow the wave, drive the wave.”
But I never really knew what he meant until I started to surf. Now I understand!
When I’m out there on the ocean floating on my board, alone with the wind
and the sky, I’m excruciatingly aware of how small and insignificant I am in
148
Part II: Getting Started 
Doing what you love
Choose an activity you especially enjoy. Maybe
it’s dancing or cooking or painting or making
love or simply playing with your kids.
Next time you engage in the activity, give your-
self to it wholeheartedly. Don’t hold back or con-
serve your energy in any way. You might
experiment with losing yourself completely in
the activity, the way children do. Don’t keep
looking at your watch or wondering how you’re
doing; just do it without reservation — until you
and the activity seem to merge and become one.
How do you know when to stop? Do you sud-
denly find yourself disengaging? Or do you
reach a natural stopping point when you intu-
itively know it’s time? And how do you feel when
you’re done? Do you feel drained and tired? Or
do you feel energized and excited? Think of this
exercise the next time you sit down to meditate.

comparison to the awesome power of the water. It would be presumptuous of
me to say that I surf the waves — in fact, the waves surf me!
I know that I can’t possibly attempt to control the water in any way. Yet I do
need to exert a certain effort: I need to concentrate on the swell, paddle at
just the right time, and position my body in just the right way to catch the
wave at its apex so that it can carry me to the shore. And I need to stay
focused as I shift my weight ever so subtly from side to side in order to ride
the wave as fully as I possibly can.
Well, meditation is like surfing. If you push too hard and try to control your
mind, you’ll just end up feeling rigid and tight, and you’ll keep wiping out as
the result of your effort. But if you hang back and exert no effort at all, you
won’t have the focus or concentration necessary to hold your position as the
waves of thought and emotion wash over you.
Like surfing — or skiing or any sport, for that matter — meditation requires a
constantly shifting balance of yang and yin, driving and following, effort and
effortlessness. As I mention in Chapter 1, concentration is the yang of medita-
tion (focused, powerful, penetrating) and receptive awareness is the yin
(open, expansive, welcoming). Although you may have to exert considerable
effort at first just to develop your concentration, try not to become tense or
obsessive about it. Let your effort be effortless, like a seasoned surfer’s.
149
Chapter 9: Effort, Discipline, and Letting Go
Digging your way to freedom
One of the great meditative traditions tells the
story of a prisoner who is sentenced to life for a
crime he did not commit. At first, he bemoans
his fate and indulges in fantasies of revenge and
regret. Then he bestirs himself and decides 
to get free, no matter what happens. So he
starts digging a hole in the wall of his cell with
a spoon — kind of like Tim Robbins in The
Shawshank Redemption.
Day after day, week after week, year after year
he digs, making slow but steady progress. Then
one day, worn out from his labors, he leans
against the back door of his cell — and it gives
beneath his weight! In an instant, he realizes
that all these years, while he was slaving away
at his attempts to get free, the door to freedom
was open all along — but he might never have
realized it had he not worked so hard to escape.
The point of this story is clear: If you practice
your meditation with steady and consistent
effort, you will eventually experience moments
when all effort drops away, the door opens
wide, and you’re simply present, aware, peace-
ful, and relaxed.
Although these moments may seem quite ordi-
nary when they occur, they can have a power-
ful, healing effect on your body and mind
because they offer you a brief glimpse of your
essential wholeness and completeness, free
from the overlays of conditioning and striving.
Yet the paradox is that the door is always open
and the glimpses of being are always available —
in a loving glance, a child’s laughter, or the
silence of the trees — but you may have to exert
effort and practice for years before you stumble
upon them. And then again, you may not!

Eventually, your concentration will arise quite naturally and take only mini-
mal effort to maintain, and you’ll be able to relax and open your awareness to
whatever arises. Even the notions of yin and yang (awareness and concentra-
tion) will ultimately drop away, and you can just be, with effortless effort —
which is the real point of meditation.
In addition to effortless effort, meditation poses a number of other paradoxes
that the mind can’t quite comprehend but that the body and heart find easy
to grasp. To practice meditation, it helps to be
 Serious yet lighthearted: After all, meditation is about lightening up —
yet, if you’re not serious enough, you won’t make any progress.
 Alert yet relaxed: Learn to balance these two qualities in your medita-
tion. If you become too relaxed, you risk falling asleep, but if you’re too
alert (that is, wired), you could become tense.
 Spontaneous yet restrained: You can be totally “in the moment” and
open to whatever arises in your awareness without becoming impulsive
or indulging every fantasy or whim.
 Engaged yet dispassionate: While being focused and attentive, you can
avoid getting caught up in the compelling and emotionally charged sto-
ries your mind spins out.
How to Let Go — and What to Let Go Of
In certain parts of Asia, they have an ingenious method for catching monkeys
alive. The hunter cuts a hole in a coconut just big enough for a monkey to
reach in with its hand, but not big enough for it to remove its closed fist.
Then the hunter puts a ripe banana inside, attaches the coconut to a string,

Part II: Getting Started 
Cat-and-mouse meditation
To learn how to meditate with effortless effort,
combining just the right balance of alertness
and relaxation, spend some time watching cats.
Although they seem so settled and self-con-
tained, cats are acutely aware of what’s going
on around them. If they hear the chirp of a bird
or see a mouse scurrying across the floor, they
can leap up in a heartbeat and pursue their prey
at full speed.
As soon as their prey has escaped, however,
cats don’t appear to become attached to the
memory of what might have been. Instead, they
settle down once again and resume their medi-
tation. You would never associate cats with
making an effort — they’re simply being them-
selves wholeheartedly, engrossed in the present
moment, open to whatever occurs. Apply this
same quality of energy and earnestness to your
meditation, and you’ll get the knack in no time.

and waits. Upon grabbing the banana, the monkey becomes so attached to
keeping the fruit that it refuses to let go, and the hunter can reel the animal in
like a fish on a hook.
As I mention in Chapter 6, your mind is like a monkey in more ways than one.
Not only does it leap about from thought to thought like a monkey in a tree,
but it also has the annoying tendency of holding tightly to certain ideas, 
opinions, thoughts, memories, and emotions, as though its life (and yours)
depends on it — and pushing away others with equal force.
This constant shifting between attachment and aversion causes you stress
because you’re constantly struggling to control what can’t be controlled.
Thoughts and feelings come and go whether you like them or not, and the
stock market falls and relationships end despite your preferences to the con-
trary. (For more on how the mind causes suffering and stress, see Chapter 5.)
In Alcoholics Anonymous and other 12-step programs, people recite the fol-
lowing prayer: “Grant me the serenity to accept what I cannot change, the
courage to change what I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.” In
meditation, you develop the power to control or change what you can — not
the events or circumstances of your life, but how you relate to them — and
the peace of mind to accept what you can’t.
Meditation teaches you how to loosen your monkey-grip on your experience
and create a kind of inner spaciousness and relaxation by letting go of control
and allowing things to be the way they are. This process has several dimen-
sions or stages, which often (though not always) occur in the order of the fol-
lowing sections.
Suspending judgment
If you’re like most people, you’re constantly judging your experience as good,
bad, or indifferent and reacting accordingly:
 “Ooh, I like that. I’m going to try to get more of it.”
 “I hate that. I’m going to avoid it at all costs.”
 “That doesn’t do anything for me. I’m not going to pay any attention to it.”
When you meditate, you begin to notice the steady stream of judgments and
how they dominate your mind and distort your experience. Instead of indulging
this habitual pattern, you can practice witnessing your experience impartially,
without judgment. When judgments arise, which they undoubtedly will, you can
just be aware of them, while avoiding the temptation to judge them as well.
Gradually, the habit of judging will loosen its grip on your mind.
151
Chapter 9: Effort, Discipline, and Letting Go

Accepting
The flip side of suspending judgment involves learning to accept things just
the way they are. You don’t necessarily have to like what you see, and you’re
welcome to change it — but first you need to experience it fully and clearly,
without the overlays of judgment and denial. For example, you may have lots
of anger bubbling up, but you may believe that this particular emotion is bad
or even evil, so you refuse to acknowledge it. 
In meditation, you have an opportunity to observe the anger just as it is —
recurrent angry thoughts, waves of anger in the belly — without trying to
change or get rid of it. (For more on meditating with challenging emotions
and mind-states, see Chapter 11.) The more you welcome the full range of
your experiences in this way, the more space you create inside yourself to
contain them — and the more you defuse those old familiar conflicts between
different parts of yourself.
Letting go
Participants in 12-step programs sometimes talk about “letting go and letting
God.” The first stage involves letting go of the illusion that you have unlim-
ited control over your life. In mindfulness meditation, you can practice letting
go by dropping all struggles to control your mind — and all ideas you may
have about how your meditation is supposed to look — and relaxing into the
present moment as it unfolds, both inside and outside. Believe it or not, you
already know how to let go — you do it every night when you drift off to sleep.
Unmasking
Letting go also has a deeper dimension: The more you loosen the stranglehold
of your likes and dislikes, preferences and prejudices, memories and stories,
the more you open to the experience of just being, beyond any limited identi-
ties or interpretations. These identities are like the layers of an onion or clouds
that hide the radiance of the sun. As your meditation deepens, you can learn to
accept and then let go of these clouds, without mistaking them for the light
they obscure. By disidentifying more and more with what you are not — the
masks that hide your true nature — you gradually begin to identify with what
you are: pure being. (For more on pure being, see Chapter 1.)
152
Part II: Getting Started 

Surrendering
As your meditation opens you to an experience of pure being, you may begin
to recognize the value of the second stage of the 12-step dictum: “letting
God.” The truth is, the power or force that’s actually controlling your life
(and which you essentially are) is far bigger than your small self, and it’s emi-
nently trustworthy — some would even say it’s sacred or divine.
When you begin to loosen your vice-grip on the steering wheel of your life, you
don’t plunge headlong into the chaotic abyss, as you might fear; instead, you
relinquish your apparent control to the one who has always been in control —
call it God or Self or pure being. In your meditation, you may actually experi-
ence this surrender as a deeper and deeper relaxation into the sacred silence
or stillness that surrounds, suffuses, and sustains you.
153
Chapter 9: Effort, Discipline, and Letting Go
Accepting and letting go
Holding on tightly and pushing away hard, lust-
ing and hating, defending and attacking — tra-
ditionally known as attachment and aversion —
are the primary causes of suffering and stress.
Along with indifference, they form the prover-
bial three poisons of meditation lore.
Fortunately, you can cultivate the antidotes to
these poisons by practicing the two most impor-
tant gestures or functions of meditation: accept-
ing and letting go. They’re inextricably entwined:
Until you accept, you can’t let go; until you let go,
you have no room to accept again. As one Zen
master put it, “Let go of it, and it fills your hand.”
Here’s a little exercise that gives you an oppor-
tunity to practice both accepting and letting go:
1. Begin by sitting comfortably and taking a
few deep breaths. Now place your atten-
tion on the coming and going of your
breath.
2. After a few minutes, shift your awareness
to your thoughts and feelings.
Take the attitude that you’re going to wel-
come whatever arises in your experience
without judging or rejecting it.
3. As thoughts and feelings come and go,
notice the movement to avoid or push away
or not see what you find unpleasant or
unacceptable.
Accept this movement as you continue to
welcome your experience, whatever it may
happen to be.
4. After five or ten minutes, when you have a
feel for accepting, shift your attention to
the process of letting go.
Take the attitude that you’re going to let go
of whatever arises, no matter how urgent or
attractive.
Notice the movement to hold on or indulge
or get involved with thoughts and feelings
you find pleasant or compelling. Gently
restrain yourself and continue to loosen
your grip and let go.
When you have a feel for both accepting and
letting go, you can combine them in the same
meditation. Whatever arises, welcome and let
go, welcome and let go. This is the twofold
rhythm of mindfulness meditation.

154
Part II: Getting Started 
Breathing with your belly
Healthy breathing involves opening and expand-
ing both your belly and your chest. As a culture,
we tend to value big chests and small bellies. As
a result, we learn early how to “suck it in” and
not let our belly (or our feelings) show. (Believe it
or not, there are cultures where a relaxed,
expanded belly is considered attractive!)
The problem is, we don’t allow ourselves to
breathe with our bellies. This habit just limits the
amount of life-enhancing oxygen we receive
and accentuates the stress pattern of tighten-
ing our abdominal muscles and diaphragm (the
big internal muscle that covers the bottom of the
rib cage) and holding our breath.
To counteract this pattern and help you relax, try
the following exercise, drawn from hatha yoga:
1. Notice how you’re breathing right now.
Which parts of your body expand when you
breathe, and which parts do not? How
deeply and quickly (or slowly) are you
breathing? Where does your breathing feel
tight or constricted? How do your belly mus-
cles and diaphragm feel?
2. Make a conscious effort to expand your
belly when you breathe.
I use the word “effort” advisedly because
your abdominal muscles and diaphragm
may be quite tight at first.
3. Breathe deeply and slowly into your belly.
Notice your body’s resistance to changing
your habitual breathing patterns.
4. Continue breathing in this way for five min-
utes and then breathe naturally.
Do you notice any differences? Do your
abdominal muscles feel more relaxed? Are
you breathing more deeply than before? Do
you feel more energized or calm?
Practice this exercise regularly — at least once
a day. It can be especially useful when you’re
stressed out or anxious and your belly starts to
tighten and your breathing constricts. Just shift
to belly breathing and notice what happens.

Opening Your Heart: 
Love, Compassion, 
and Forgiveness
In This Chapter
 The pros and cons of opening your heart
 Exploring your “soft spot” and the tender emotions inside
 Directing your love to yourself (the hardest part!) and others
 Some great techniques for cultivating compassion
 Cleaning out your “arteries” with forgiveness and gratitude
P
erhaps you’re wondering why I devote a chapter of this book to the
heart. After all, isn’t it true that meditation involves sitting quietly and
focusing the mind, whereas affairs of the heart are best reserved for romantic
encounters and intimate family discussions?
Well, the great meditative traditions teach that you can cultivate the energy
of the heart in meditation the same way you cultivate awareness (for more on
awareness, see Chapter 1). Whether it takes the form of love, joy, peace, com-
passion, or devotion, you can consciously and deliberately generate and
expand this energy to create a field that benefits not only yourself, but also
the people around you.
Like sunlight, the radiance of an open heart warms and nourishes everyone it
touches. But the heart, like the sun, is often closed in and obscured by
clouds, in the form of difficult emotions and mind-states like fear, anger, judg-
ment, and doubt. When you practice meditation, you gradually dispel some
of these clouds by quieting and calming your agitated mind (see Chapter 6).
You can also work directly with unraveling the negative stories your mind
tells you and dealing with challenging emotions, as I explain in Chapter 11.
Then again, you can take the approach I describe in this chapter: You can
burn the clouds away by amplifying the natural warmth of your heart
through practices designed to cultivate love and compassion.

Before I show you how to do this, however, I’d like to take you on a guided
tour of the territory. Yes, I know you know where your heart is. But have you
ever explored it with focused attention? Do you know what causes it to close —
and what keeps it closed? And have you ever considered all the ways you can
benefit from opening it? Here are some answers.
How Your Heart Closes — and 
How You Can Open It Again
Needless to say, you weren’t born with your heart closed. As anyone who’s
ever spent any time with a newborn knows, babies have hearts that radiate
love like the sun in the tropics. But as you grow up, the bumps and bruises
and hardships of life gradually force you to protect your tenderness and
other softer emotions with a layer of toughness and defensiveness — the
clouds I talked about earlier. This layer surrounds and encloses the heart,
protecting your vulnerability — but also keeping your own love locked inside
and the love of other people from entering.
Perhaps you’re one of those rare individuals whose heart remains open most
of the time. If so, congratulations! Or maybe you wrap yourself in a cloud
cover — or something even denser, like armor — when you head out the
door each morning, but lay it aside when you spend time with friends or
family members. Perhaps your heart naturally opens and closes in an ebb
and flow like the weather. Or you may be among the millions of people who
have difficulty letting love in or extending it to others.
Don’t lose heart! You can definitely discover how to open your heart again, as
I discuss later in this section. But first I’d like to describe the factors that
keep closing your heart when it opens — or keep it closed entirely — and the
benefits that come with an open heart, in case you haven’t already figured
them out.
Some factors that keep closing your heart
Like most human beings, you close your heart, whether automatically or
deliberately, because you feel angry, hurt, or threatened by others. Perhaps
you’re afraid they’ll take advantage of your kindness or crush your tender
feelings with their insensitivity or restimulate painful memories. Or maybe
you’re just ticked off about all the times you’ve been mistreated, and you
don’t want to let it happen again. We all have our own unique reasons for
closing our hearts. Whatever yours happen to be, they may be preventing
you from getting the love you really want.
156
Part II: Getting Started 

Here are some of the most common factors that close the heart:
 Fear: When you’re afraid, for whatever reason — of being attacked, criti-
cized, manipulated, overwhelmed — you close your heart in self-
defense. As one popular slogan puts it, love is letting go of fear — and
learning how to trust, both yourself and others.
 Resentment: When you hold on to old hurts and let bitterness and
resentment build up in your heart, you shut your heart, not only to the
people who hurt you but also to life itself.
 Unresolved grief: This natural human emotion can get stuck if you con-
tinue to mull over your losses and refuse to let go of the past. When grief
fills your heart, you’re reluctant to open it because you don’t want to
feel the pain inside.
 Jealousy: Actually a brand of resentment, jealousy can close your heart
to the person who has what you wish you had — and to yourself as well
for being somehow “inferior.”
 Pain: Also known as hurt, this feeling, if allowed to build to intolerable
levels, may cause you to board up your heart completely and post a sign
saying, “Keep out! No trespassing!”
 Grasping and attachment: As long as you’re emotionally attached to
having life go a certain way, you’re going to close your heart as soon as
other people interfere. In fact, emotions like grief, pain, and even resent-
ment are ultimately rooted in attachment — and the fear of losing what
you’re attached to.
 Self-clinging: If you believe that you’re an isolated individual cut off
from other people and from your own essential being, you’re going to
hold on to your own little piece of turf — your own possessions, your
own accomplishments, your own happiness — and close your heart, if
necessary, to defend it. Also known as ego in many of the meditative tra-
ditions, self-clinging perpetuates separation and gives rise to the other
factors in this list.
Ultimately, of course, only the most enlightened, selfless people can keep
their hearts open all the time. I mean, we’re talking Jesus or Mother Teresa
here! As for the rest of us, we’re going to keep closing our hearts again and
again. Only when we’ve dissolved the barriers that separate us from others —
which is what enlightenment is all about — can we keep our hearts open
even in the most difficult circumstances.
But, enlightened or not, you can definitely develop the ability to open your
heart when you choose to do so. In fact, the regular practice of meditation
gradually erodes the experience of separation that causes the heart to stay
closed in the first place. (For more on separation, see Chapter 5.) Who

Chapter 10: Opening Your Heart: Love, Compassion, and Forgiveness

Some good reasons for keeping it open
Imagine that an extraterrestrial lands on Earth and tries to make sense of us
human beings from our pop music. It would probably conclude that we
regard love (whatever that might be!) as infinitely more precious than every-
thing else combined. But once the ET figures out how to measure love, it
might be surprised to discover how little of the invaluable substance actually
flows between us most of the time. Love, the ET would no doubt deduce, is
not only precious, it’s incredibly hard to find.
For creatures who want to be loved, appreciated, even adored, we certainly
go about fulfilling our desire in a curiously unfulfilling way. Instead of manu-
facturing it ourselves in the little love machine inside our chests, we com-
plain about not getting enough of it, search frantically for someone else to
give it to us, and try to make ourselves more lovable by improving our looks
or earning more money. But the truth is, the Beatles song has it right: The
love you take is equal to the love you make. In other words, the most effec-
tive way to get love is to generate it yourself.
By cultivating caring, loving feelings, you can actually provide yourself with
the nourishment you seek. At the same time, by radiating those feelings out-
ward to others, you can touch their tender hearts and naturally elicit the
same feelings in them, creating a flow of love that keeps circulating between
you and building on itself.

Kindness is the key
Although the cultivation of an open heart defi-
nitely deserves a chapter of its own, it’s tradi-
tionally considered the foundation on which
meditation practice rests, rather than a sepa-
rate technique or approach.
In Southeast Asia, for example, meditators are
taught how to develop generosity, patience, and
lovingkindness before they learn how to medi-
tate. And Tibetan practitioners dedicate the
benefit of every meditation to the peace and
harmony of all beings, not just themselves. As
the Dalai Lama, recipient of the Nobel Peace
Prize, says, “My religion is kindness.”
You can follow every technique to the T, but if
your heart’s not in it, you won’t reap all the won-
derful benefits of meditation.
To be open to the present moment, for example,
as mindfulness meditation teaches (for more on
mindfulness, see Chapter 6), you need to be
open with every dimension of your being: body,
mind, spirit, and heart. So be sure to bring a mea-
sure of love and caring to your meditation —
especially toward yourself!

If you’ve never experienced this kind of flow with someone yourself, you’ve
perhaps met people who live this way. Their eyes sparkle with positive
regard, their words speak well of everyone, and they elicit love wherever they
go. Through the practices described here, you, too, can begin to generate a
flow of loving feelings. It all depends on you.
Here are a few of the innumerable benefits of learning how to love:
 Energy and expansiveness: If you’ve ever been in love (maybe you are
right now!), you know how vital and alive you can feel when your heart
is wide open. Instead of the usual sense of limitation you ordinarily expe-
rience, you feel like you have no boundaries, as though you can’t really
tell where you leave off and the outside world (or your beloved) begins.
 Peace and well-being: When your heart is filled with love, you feel
happy and peaceful for no external reason. In fact, love, happiness, joy,
peace, and well-being are just different names and versions of the same
basic energy — the loving, life-giving energy of the heart.
 Good health: Yes, love is life-giving and life-enhancing. For one thing, it
brings people together to create babies, and, in general, love contributes
to optimal health by providing an immeasurable vital spark that not only
nourishes the internal organs but also provides the body (and the
person) with a reason to live. Dean Ornish, M.D., author of Dr. Dean
Ornish’s Program for Reversing Heart Disease, found that love is more
important than any other factor in the healing process, including diet
and exercise. To heal your heart, he discovered, you need to open your
heart. (For more on Dr. Ornish, see Chapter 2.)
 Belonging and interconnectedness: As another old song puts it, love
makes the world go round — and it certainly draws people together and
keeps them connected. When you open your heart to others, you natu-
rally feel joined with them in a meaningful way. In the deepest sense,
love is the source of all meaning and belonging.
 Spiritual awakening: As they gradually erode your sense of separate-
ness from others, loving feelings can eventually reveal the essential
nature of life, which is, paradoxically, also love. Ultimately, the Sufis
teach, we are simply love searching for itself.
Discovering your “soft spot”
One of my teachers, the Tibetan meditation master Sogyal Rinpoche, used to
refer to the place inside where you feel tender, loving emotions as your soft
spot. The soft spot can be found in your heart, beneath all the toughness and
defensiveness. To reach it, you have to risk encountering feelings you might
otherwise wish to avoid, such as fear, grief, anger, and the others talked
159
Chapter 10: Opening Your Heart: Love, Compassion, and Forgiveness

about earlier in this chapter. You’ll know the soft spot when you get there
because it has a tender sweetness to it that’s often tinged with a certain sad-
ness or melancholy about the human condition. (In fact, you may find it
slightly painful to open your heart at first, simply because of this sadness,
which is actually one of the seeds of compassion.)
Because you’ll need to be familiar with your soft spot in order to practice the
meditations provided in the remainder of this chapter, you may want to
experiment with the following exercise:
1. Begin by closing your eyes, taking a few deep breaths, and relaxing
your body a little on each exhalation.
Remember to be kind to yourself.
2. Imagine the face of someone who loved you very much as a child and
whose love moved you deeply.
In the East, they recommend using your mother, but some Westerners
tend to have more problematic relationships with their parents, so you
may prefer to use your grandmother or grandfather or some other
unconditionally loving figure. (If you never received love like this as a
child, you can think of some famous person that you consider to be
unconditionally loving, such as Jesus or Buddha or the Divine Mother.)
3. Remember a particular instance in which this person showed his 
or her love for you and you really received it and allowed it to nur-
ture you.
160
Part II: Getting Started 
The warrior of the heart
For all you tough guys (and gals) who believe
that opening the heart is best reserved for
sissies and fools, here’s some wise counsel
from the Tibetan meditation master Chogyam
Trungpa. (No stranger to toughness, Trungpa,
like the Dalai Lama and thousands of other
Tibetans, escaped from his homeland when the
Chinese invaded and walked across the
Himalayas over a series of precipitous mountain
passes to India.)
In his book Shambhala: The Sacred Path of 
the Warrior, he explains that facing your fear
and negativity and being willing to keep your
heart open — even in the most challenging 
circumstances — takes tremendous courage.
Although you probably think of warriors as
impenetrable, unfeeling, and heavily defended,
Trungpa takes the opposite view. The sacred
warrior who practices meditation, he suggests,
is not afraid to feel tender — or to communicate
this tenderness to others.
The point is, you can take care of yourself —
even defend yourself from harm, when neces-
sary — without closing your heart. An open
heart doesn’t make you powerless or ineffec-
tual. Quite the contrary, it allows you to respond
to situations wisely and skillfully because you
feel others’ suffering as well as your own.

4. Notice the tender, loving feelings this memory evokes in your heart.
The place where you feel them is your soft spot.
5. Notice if any other feelings accompany the tenderness and gratitude
you feel.
6. If you find it difficult to re-experience the love, pay attention to what
gets in your way.
What are some of the feelings standing guard over your soft spot?
7. Begin to explore the area around your soft spot.
What is the state of your heart right now? What are some of the other
feelings you find stirring inside, in addition to (or instead of) love? Do
you notice any tension or bracing around your heart that keeps it from
opening to love?
8. Be aware of what you find, without judgment or self-criticism.
Love begins with you
You may find it difficult to feel love and extend it to others because you didn’t
get much of it yourself as a child. Even though you never really learned how
to give and receive love freely, people are constantly asking you for what you
believe you don’t have. You’re like a person living in the desert with a dry
well; you can’t share any water with others because you don’t have any your-
self. Or you may find that your well has water but constantly runs dry just
when you need it most.
The meditations provided in this chapter dig a well deep into your soft spot,
where the waters of love never run dry. (In fact, the love I’m talking about
doesn’t belong to anyone; it just bubbles up from a mysterious and inex-
haustible source.) You may need to prime the pump, though. That’s why the
traditional instructions counsel you to begin each meditation on love and
compassion by focusing on yourself. When you’ve filled your own well to the
brim, you can begin to extend the overflow to include others as well.
Just as you can’t really heal others until you’ve healed yourself to a certain
degree, you can’t love others until you feel deeply loved yourself. Besides,
you deserve love at least as much as anyone else. In the West, we often prac-
tice self-denial, while equating self-love with selfishness. Yet, the reverse gen-
erally holds true: People who love themselves give love more freely and
generously than those who don’t.
As a remedy for the widespread Western disease of self-criticism and self-
denial, the meditative traditions offer the practice of self-love. In particular,
as you work with opening your heart, you can remember to keep your heart
open to yourself even, paradoxically, when your heart is closed.
161
Chapter 10: Opening Your Heart: Love, Compassion, and Forgiveness

Four dimensions of love
Like water, love comes in many shapes and sizes. Just as a crystal-clear
mountain lake, a still forest pool, a trickling creek, and a roaring river are all
composed of water, so tender emotions like kindness, compassion, joy, grati-
tude, forgiveness, devotion, generosity, and peace or equanimity arise in the
heart and ultimately consist of love. Remember: These aren’t abstractions —
they’re natural human qualities that you can learn how to cultivate and com-
municate to others.
Among all these tender emotions, the Buddhists emphasize the following four
as the cornerstones of a happy and fulfilling life:
 Lovingkindness: Arises spontaneously in response to the kindness of
others and consists of warm, loving, caring feelings that can be deliber-
ately increased and extended.
 Compassion: Takes love a step further. In addition to caring about
others, you also feel their suffering and naturally feel motivated to help
relieve it. (The word compassion means “to suffer with.”)
 Sympathetic joy: Is the flip side of compassion. It consists of happy feel-
ings that arise in response to the happiness and good fortune of others.
 Equanimity: Can be cultivated through the basic meditation practices
taught in this book; also known as steadiness of heart. No matter what hap-
pens, you expand to include it without allowing it to upset or disturb you.
162
Part II: Getting Started 
Appreciating your own goodness
If you have difficulty extending loving feelings to
yourself, you may want to take five or ten min-
utes to reflect on your good qualities or the good
things you’ve done in your life. Go ahead, it
won’t hurt you!
In the West, we have a cultural taboo against
praising ourselves. Instead, we often focus on
our shortcomings, which only ends up making us
feel contracted and afraid. “Pride goes before a
fall,” chides the old slogan, suggesting that you’d
better watch out because any satisfaction you
take in yourself or your accomplishments could
destroy you. “Who do you think you are?”
intones the childhood voice of an exasperated
mother or father, unwittingly teaching shame and
self-doubt.
Despite what your parents (or other influential
people) may have implied or told you, it’s okay
to be happy and to feel good about yourself. By
focusing on your goodness, you actually gener-
ate positive, expansive feelings that nourish you
and everyone around you. “Joy,” said the
Buddha, “is the gateway to nirvana.”

In the following sections, I focus on love and compassion, with some special
attention to gratitude and forgiveness as antidotes to the resentment and fear
that so often keep the heart closed.
How to Generate Love for 
Yourself and Others
As I mentioned earlier, you have a love factory right here in your chest. Now
you’re going to discover how to use it! As a child, you probably received
plenty of advice on how to use your mind. Your teachers taught you how to
solve math problems and memorize facts; your parents may have helped you
with your homework; perhaps you even read some books on speed-reading
or improving your study habits. But did anyone ever sit you down and
explain how to love? Sure, you had role models — but did they teach you
how to do what they did? In this section, you’re going to pick up some skills
you never studied at home or in school.
Opening the gates
The following steps are a meditation for connecting with your soft spot and
initiating the flow of unconditional love, also known as lovingkindness. (To
distinguish this kind of love from conditional love, imagine the love of a good
mother for her baby. She gives her love freely and unconditionally, without
expecting anything in return except her baby’s happiness and well-being.) As
with all the meditations presented in this chapter, you may want to begin
with five or ten minutes of a mindfulness practice like counting or following
your breaths (see Chapter 6, or listen to the mindfulness track on the CD) in
order to deepen and stabilize your concentration. Once you get the knack,
though, the cultivation of lovingkindness itself can be an excellent way to
develop concentration. (For detailed audio instructions in lovingkindness
meditation, check out Track 7 on the CD.)
1. Begin by closing your eyes, taking a few deep breaths, and relaxing
your body a little with each exhalation.
2. Imagine the face of someone who loved you very much as a child and
whose love moved you deeply.
3. Remember a time when this person showed his or her love for you
and you really took it in.
4. Notice the gratitude and love this memory evokes in your heart.
Allow these feelings to well up and fill your heart.
163
Chapter 10: Opening Your Heart: Love, Compassion, and Forgiveness

5. Gently extend these feelings to this loved one.
You may even experience a circulation of love between the two of you as
you give and receive love freely.
6. Allow these loving feelings to overflow and gradually suffuse your
whole being.
Allow yourself to be filled with love.
Directing the flow
When you’ve initiated the flow of love, you can channel it, first to yourself
and then to the other people in your life. After practicing the preceding medi-
tation for five minutes or longer, continue in the following way:
1. As you allow lovingkindness to fill your being, you may want to
express the wishes and intentions that underlie this love.
For example, you might say to yourself, as the Buddhists do, “May I be
happy. May I be peaceful. May I be free from suffering.” Or you may want
to choose something from the Western religious tradition, such as “May I
be filled with the grace and love of God.” Feel free to use whatever
words feel right for you. Just be sure to keep them general, simple, and
emotionally evocative. As the recipient, be sure to take in the love as
well as extend it.
2. When you feel complete with yourself for now, imagine someone for
whom you feel gratitude and respect. Take some time (at least a few
minutes) to direct the flow of love to this person, using similar words
to express your intentions.
Don’t hurry; allow yourself to feel the love as much as you can, rather
than merely imagine it.
3. Take some time to direct this lovingkindness to a loved one or dear
friend in a similar way.
4. Direct this flow of love to someone for whom you feel neutral — per-
haps someone you see from time to time but toward whom you have
neither positive nor negative feelings.
5. Now, for the hardest part of this exercise: Direct your lovingkindness
to someone toward whom you feel mildly negative feelings like irrita-
tion or hurt.
By extending love to this person, even just a little at first, you begin to
develop the capacity to keep your heart open even in challenging cir-
cumstances. Eventually, you can extend love to people toward whom
you experience stronger emotions like anger, fear, or pain.
164
Part II: Getting Started 

Like the other meditations in this book, lovingkindness can benefit from
extended practice. Instead of a few minutes for each phase, try spending five
or even ten. The more time and attention you give it, the more you’ll begin to
notice subtle (or not-so-subtle!) changes in the way you feel from moment to
moment.
You may find that your heart continues to radiate a wish for the well-being of
others (and yourself) long after you’ve ended your formal meditation. And
you may discover that situations that once provoked you to harsh words or
frightened withdrawal now elicit softer feelings like sympathy or compassion.
Even if you feel nothing at first, just repeating your wishes and intentions can
have a noticeable effect.
In her book Lovingkindness, the American Buddhist teacher Sharon Salzberg
tells the story of a retreat in which she did nothing but extend lovingkindness
to herself from morning to night for seven days. She reports that she felt
absolutely nothing and found the whole endeavor excruciatingly boring. The
day she left, she dropped a jar, which shattered all over the floor. Instead of a
stream of self-recriminations, her immediate response was quite simple:
“You’re really a klutz, but I love you.” “Wow,” she thought, “something did
happen after all.”
165
Chapter 10: Opening Your Heart: Love, Compassion, and Forgiveness
Allowing life to keep opening your heart
As you go through your day, you no doubt
encounter moments when you feel a sponta-
neous rush of love or compassion. Maybe you
glimpse a homeless old woman pushing a shop-
ping cart or hear a dog howling unhappily or see
the face of a starving child or a grieving mother
in some faraway place on the evening news,
and your heart goes out to this being in com-
passion. Or perhaps someone does something
unexpectedly kind for you or a good friend
reminds you that she loves you or you gaze into
the eyes of someone you care about deeply, and
you feel love and gratitude welling up in your
heart.
Instead of rushing on to the next moment or
pushing the feeling away uncomfortably, you can
take some time to close your eyes, meditate on
it, and allow it to deepen. Life has the capacity,
all by itself, to keep opening your heart, if you let
it. Your job is merely to gently extend those
moments until they gradually begin to fill your life.

How to Transform Suffering 
with Compassion
When you’ve become proficient in opening your heart and extending love to
yourself and others, you may want to experiment with compassion, which is
simply another form of love. (Or you could just start here and leave lov-
ingkindness till later.) When you’re moved by the suffering of others and feel
a spontaneous desire to help relieve their pain in some way, you’re experienc-
ing the emotion known as compassion. Unlike pity, compassion doesn’t sepa-
rate you from others or make you feel superior. Quite the contrary: In the
moment of compassion, the walls that ordinarily keep you separate come
tumbling down, and you feel others’ pain as though it were your own.
You may be reluctant to cultivate compassion because you’re afraid of being
overwhelmed by the enormous suffering that surrounds you. After all, the
world is plagued by violence, poverty, and disease, you might argue, and
there’s only so much you can do about it. But the truth is, the more you allow
yourself to experience compassion, the less overwhelmed you actually feel!
If you just want to use meditation to improve your life, you don’t have to
bother reading this section (although I’d like to suggest that you can improve
your life immeasurably by opening your heart to compassion). But if you
want to extend the benefits of your meditation to others — and become a
more compassionate human being in the process — then I couldn’t recom-
mend a more helpful set of practices. Begin by cultivating compassion. Then,
if you want, you can experiment with using it to transform the suffering of
others in your own heart. Though these practices may be simple, they’re
extremely effective for dissolving the clouds that hide the heart.
Some preliminary exercises 
for generating compassion
Here are some brief meditations for cultivating compassion. They have been
adapted from The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying by Sogyal Rinpoche, a
Tibetan meditation teacher, who writes, “The power of compassion knows no
bounds.”
Realizing that others are the same as you
When you’re having difficulty with a loved one or friend, look beyond your
conflict and the role this person plays in your life, and spend some time
reflecting on the fact that this person is a human being just like you. She has
the same desire for happiness and well-being, the same fear of suffering, the
same need for love. Notice how this meditation changes your feelings for her
and affects your difficulties.
166
Part II: Getting Started 

Putting yourself in another’s place
When you encounter someone who’s suffering and you don’t know how to
help, take some time to imagine yourself in this person’s position. What
would it be like for you if you were experiencing the same problems? How
would you feel? What would you need? How would you like others to
respond? Notice if you have a clearer sense now of how to help this person.
Imagining a loved one in place of another
Instead of putting yourself in the place of someone who’s suffering, you may
find it even easier to generate compassion if you imagine that someone you
love deeply is experiencing the same difficulties. How would you feel? What
would you do to help them? Now transfer these feelings to the person who’s
actually suffering, and notice how it changes your appreciation of the situa-
tion. (Not only will this meditation cause no harm to your loved one, assures
Sogyal Rinpoche, she may actually benefit from having compassion directed
her way.)
167
Chapter 10: Opening Your Heart: Love, Compassion, and Forgiveness
What if you can’t open your heart — or difficult
emotions arise when you do?
If you don’t feel much of anything in your heart
as you do the exercises in this chapter, don’t
worry. Just as you may need to pump for a while
before you get water from an underground well,
you may find that you need to repeat your
wishes and intentions for the well-being of
others again and again before you get any
noticeable results — and that your feelings
fluctuate from day to day. Just keep going, with
the confidence that you’ll eventually feel love
arising in your heart. And if you don’t, that’s
okay, too. No matter what you feel, your good
wishes will have immeasurable benefit for
everyone, including yourself.
Some people find that these heart-opening prac-
tices flush to the surface challenging negative
emotions like grief, fear, resentment, or rage. If
this happens to you, my advice once again is:
Don’t worry, you’re not doing anything wrong!
Quite the contrary, you’re bringing to aware-
ness the unresolved and unintegrated emotions
that have kept your heart closed. Just extend
lovingkindness to yourself and to the emotions
themselves, welcoming them into your heart as
much as you can. Just as Beauty’s love turned
the Beast into a prince, you can eventually
transform your ugliest parts through the power
of lovingkindness. (For more on working with
challenging emotions, see Chapter 11.)

Dedicating the merits
When you know what compassion feels like, you can practice dedicating the
value of all your positive actions to the well-being of others. In particular, you
may want to follow the traditional practice of dedicating whatever virtue or
merit may accrue from your meditations to all beings everywhere. You can do
this simply by expressing the intention in words of your own choosing, accom-
panied by a heartfelt wish that all beings be happy and free of suffering.
Transforming suffering with 
the power of the heart
As you may discover when you do the following practice, the heart is a pow-
erful organ indeed. Of course, I’m not referring to the physical heart, but to
an energetic center located in the middle of the chest, right near the anatomi-
cal heart. Yet the two have an intimate connection, as Dr. Dean Ornish’s work
confirms: To heal your heart, you need to open your heart. (For more on
Dean Ornish’s Opening the Heart Program, see Chapter 2. For more on energy
centers, see Chapter 12.)
By doing this meditation regularly, you can actually develop the capacity to
transform your own suffering and the suffering of others into peace, joy, and
love. The amazing thing is, the process doesn’t weaken or overwhelm you, as
you might fear. Quite the contrary, it helps you develop confidence in the
strength and resilience of your own heart and in your ability to touch the
lives of others.
If you don’t believe me, give this meditation a try. As soon as you get the knack,
practice it regularly for several weeks, and notice what happens. Whether or
not the people in your life suffer less (and they may), I can guarantee that you’ll
eventually end up feeling more peaceful and loving yourself. (For detailed
audio instructions, check out Track 8 on your CD.)
1. Begin by sitting in a comfortable position, taking a few deep breaths,
and meditating in your usual way for a few minutes.
For complete meditation instructions, see Chapter 6.
2. Close your eyes and imagine the most loving and compassionate indi-
viduals you’ve ever known or heard about gathered together above
your head.
If appropriate, include religious or spiritual figures like Jesus, Mohammed,
Mother Mary, the Dalai Lama, or your favorite saint or sage.
168
Part II: Getting Started 

3. Imagine that they all merge into one being, who glows and radiates
the warmth and light of love and compassion.
4. Imagine that this being descends into your heart, where it takes the
form of a sphere of infinitely radiant, infinitely compassionate light
that merges with your own soft spot.
In the following phases, you practice taking in negativity, transforming it in
the sphere inside your heart, and sending out positive energy to yourself
and others:
Phase 1: Transforming the atmosphere
1. Take a moment to notice the state of your mind right now.
2. On an inhalation, breathe in any negativity, agitation, darkness, or
depression you find there and take it into the sphere of light in your
heart, where you imagine it being transformed into clarity, calm,
peace, and joy.
3. On the exhalation, breathe these positive qualities into your mind and
feel them filling and purifying it.
4. Continue to breathe in the dark and breathe out the light for several
minutes.
If it helps, you might imagine the negative as a hot, dark smoke and the
positive as a cool, white light.
Phase 2: Transforming yourself
1. Imagine yourself in front of you and become aware of your own
stress, suffering, and dissatisfaction.
You may find, for example, that you’re angry with your boss or afraid of
an upcoming challenge or still hurt or bitter about some mistreatment
you received as a child.
2. Allow yourself to feel compassion for yourself and your own suffering.
3. As you inhale, breathe in to the sphere of light in your heart whatever
suffering you find and breathe out a soothing, caring, compassionate
energy that envelops and fills the “you” in front of you.
If you find it helpful to use a particular image for this energy, such as
fresh flowers or a cool breeze, go right ahead. Or you can use the image
of white light suggested in the previous phase.
4. Continue taking in and giving forth in this way for five minutes or
longer.
169
Chapter 10: Opening Your Heart: Love, Compassion, and Forgiveness

Phase 3: Transforming situations
1. Recall a recent situation in which you acted badly or inappropriately.
Perhaps you blame yourself or feel guilty or remorseful, or maybe
you’ve been resisting these feelings. Recollect the situation as vividly
as possible.
2. Notice how your actions affected the other people involved.
3. Take full responsibility for your actions.
Notice that I said responsibility, not blame. You blew it, and you whole-
heartedly acknowledge that you blew it, without beating yourself up
about it, but also without denying or justifying what you did.
4. Breathe in the responsibility as well as any blame, pain, or other neg-
ative emotions involved and breathe out forgiveness, understanding,
reconciliation, and harmony.
5. Continue in this way for several minutes.
If another situation comes to mind, set it aside and do this practice with
it at another time.
Phase 4: Transforming others
1. Imagine a friend or loved one who happens to be suffering right now.
2. Breathe in the person’s pain and suffering with compassion and
breathe out love, peace, joy, and healing.
3. After several minutes, begin to widen the circle of your compassion to
include first other people you care about, then those toward whom
you feel neutral, and then those you dislike or find difficult.
(For more on the order of this progression, see the section “How to
Generate Love for Yourself and Others” earlier in this chapter.) Breathe
in their suffering and pain and breathe out peace, love, and joy, using
any images you find helpful.
4. Extend your compassion in this way, first to all the people in the
world and then to all beings everywhere.
Though you won’t be able to visualize them, you can sense their pres-
ence as you breathe in and breathe out.
5. End the meditation by dedicating any virtue you may have accumu-
lated through this practice to the benefit of all beings.
You can do these phases out of order or separately, if you choose, but it’s
important to begin the practice each time with yourself.

How to Cut through Your Resistance 
with Gratitude and Forgiveness
Opening the heart and keeping it open poses a challenge even to the most
loving among us. So don’t be surprised if you have plenty of resistance to
doing the exercises presented in this chapter. When you attempt to open
your heart, you may unearth layers of resentment toward people who mis-
treated or harmed you in some way in the past. Or you may simply feel
resentful toward life for all the curveballs it’s thrown you, all the unfulfilled
expectations and broken dreams. If so, join the club!
To soften this resentment, which may form a kind of crust over your heart,
you might like to develop the qualities of forgiveness and gratitude. The first
allows you to dissolve and let go of all the old wrongs (including those that
you believe you yourself committed); the second cultivates an appreciation
of all the good things you’ve received (and continue to receive) in this life but
may never have fully acknowledged.
Forgiveness: The universal solvent
If resentment — which is just another word for old anger that has built up
over the months and years — is the gunk that clogs the free flow of love in
and out of your heart, then forgiveness is the universal solvent that washes it
away. You may harbor resentment for one person in particular or for a room
full of people, harkening all the way back to early childhood. Whatever your
situation, you can dissolve the resentment if you choose — but you have to
be willing! To make it easier, you may want to begin by including the people
you resent in your lovingkindness meditation. (See the section “How to
Generate Love for Yourself and Others” earlier in this chapter, or listen to the
lovingkindness track on the CD.) And guess what? Here again, you may dis-
cover that the person you most need to love and forgive is yourself.
Here’s a meditation to help you dissolve resentment, hurt, and guilt and open
your heart again to yourself and others:
1. As usual, begin by sitting comfortably, taking a few deep breaths,
relaxing your body, and closing your eyes.
2. Allow images and memories of words, actions, and even thoughts for
which you’ve never forgiven yourself to float through your mind.
Perhaps you hurt someone you loved and drove him away or took some-
thing that didn’t belong to you or said no to an opportunity and later
regretted it.

Chapter 10: Opening Your Heart: Love, Compassion, and Forgiveness

3. Reflect on how much suffering you’ve caused and how much you may
have suffered yourself. Allow yourself to feel any pain or remorse.
4. Gently and wholeheartedly extend forgiveness to yourself, using
words like the following:
“I forgive you for all the mistakes you’ve made and all the suffering
you’ve caused. I forgive you for all the pain you’ve caused others,
whether intentionally or unintentionally. I know that you’ve learned and
grown; now it’s time to move on. I forgive you! May you be happy and
joyful. I take you back into my heart.” (Here and elsewhere, feel free to
use your own words, if you prefer.)
5. Open your heart to yourself and allow yourself to fill with love.
Feel the clouds around your heart dispersing.
6. Imagine a person you love toward whom you feel some resentment.
Reflect on how that person may have hurt you. Reflect also on how
many times you’ve hurt others in a similar way.
7. Gently allow the clouds around your heart to continue dispersing as
you wholeheartedly extend forgiveness to this person, using words
like the following:
“I forgive you for the ways that you’ve caused me pain, whether inten-
tionally or unintentionally. I know that I too have hurt others and let
them down. With my whole heart, I forgive you. May you be happy and
joyful. I take you back into my heart.” Feel your heart opening once
again to this person.
8. Imagine someone whose forgiveness you need.
Perhaps you hurt or mistreated him in some way.
9. Gently ask his forgiveness in words like the following:
“Please forgive me for what I did or said to cause you pain, whether
intentionally or unintentionally. I ask your forgiveness. Please take me
back into your heart.”
10. Imagine this person’s heart opening to you and the love flowing freely
back and forth between you once again.
11. Imagine someone toward whom you feel great resentment — someone,
perhaps, whom you’ve excluded from your heart because of how he
once hurt you.
12. Gently allow the clouds around your heart to disperse, and whole-
heartedly extend forgiveness to this person, as described in Step 7.
13. Reflect on all the many people toward whom you’ve closed your heart
because of the pain they seemingly caused you.
Feel all the layers of resentment and pain that have built up around your
heart over the years.
172
Part II: Getting Started 

14. Reflect on all the many ways that you’ve acted as they did.
15. Imagine all these people in front of you, and, with your whole heart,
forgive them all and ask their forgiveness in words like the following:
“I forgive you for whatever you may have done to cause me pain,
whether intentionally or unintentionally. I forgive you. Please forgive me.
May we open our hearts to one another and live together in peace and
harmony.” Again, feel your heart opening wide and allow love to flow
freely between you.
16. Take a few moments to breathe deeply and rest your attention in your
heart before getting up and going about your day.
Instead of doing the full forgiveness meditation presented here, you can just
extend forgiveness to particular people as the situation requires. But every
time you practice forgiveness, be sure to include some for yourself.
Gratitude: The source of joy
When you look at other people, what do you notice? Do you register all the
many ways they withhold from you or ignore you or deliberately hurt you?
Do you see how life fails to live up to your expectations and how you fail to
live up to your own potential? Or do you notice all the many, often invisible,
ways that life supports and sustains you — and people love and help you?
Depending on whether you’re an optimist or a pessimist, your glass can seem
half empty or half full. Well, believe it or not, you actually have the power to
choose which perspective you take. In the following meditations, you have a
chance to remind yourself how full your cup actually is!
Remembering the good
Here’s an exercise that’s designed to evoke appreciation in even the most
stubbornly negative person:
1. Begin by settling comfortably and taking a few deep breaths.
2. Spend a few minutes reviewing all the good things that happened to
you in the past 24 hours.
You may recall a moment when someone treated you with love or 
kindness — maybe it was a friend or family member or just a person in
a store or on the street. Perhaps you’re reminded of some simple plea-
sure, like eating a good meal or seeing the sunlight in the trees or the
smile on a baby’s face.
3. Reflect in the same detail on all the good things you did during the
same 24-hour period.
173
Chapter 10: Opening Your Heart: Love, Compassion, and Forgiveness

4. Allow yourself to feel appreciation and gratitude for these special
moments.
5. Reflect in the same way on the previous week.
Continue to breathe while you recall all the good things that happened.
If negative memories come up, set them aside for now.
6. If you have enough time, gradually extend the meditation to the past
month, the past year — the past two years, the past five.
Recall as much as possible all the pleasant, happy, joyful moments, as
well as all the good things you did and all the ways you were gifted or
supported by others.
7. Allow feelings of gratitude and appreciation to well up in your heart.
If you have plenty of time, you can extend the meditation to include your
whole life. Of course, you won’t be able to remember all the good things, but
be sure to cover all the headline events, including the ways that your parents
nurtured and supported you and made it possible for you to grow into the
person you are today. If you have resentment toward one or both of your par-
ents, do the forgiveness meditation in the previous section.
Seventy-two labors
When I was a Zen monk, we used to chant a meal dedication that expressed
our gratitude for the “72 [that is, innumerable] labors” that brought us our
food. By reflecting on all the efforts that make it possible for you to live the
way you do, you can cut through any tendency you may have to feel bitter,
resentful, or unappreciative.
Here’s a brief exercise to help you appreciate how dependent you are on the
energy and hard work of others:
1. Begin by settling comfortably and taking a few deep breaths.
2. Bring to mind some modern convenience that you find indispensable.
It may be your car, your computer, or your cellphone.
3. Reflect for a few moments on how important this object is to you and
what your life would be like without it.
Sure, you could always get another one, but right now you depend on
this particular object — it’s the only one you have.
4. Think of all the people and hard work that contributed to creating
this object, from raw material to finished product.
If it’s your car, for example, you can think first of the miners in various
parts of the world, possibly working in difficult circumstances, who
extracted the iron and chromium and other ores that make up the metal.
Then you can imagine the steel and iron workers who mixed the alloys
and forged the parts. You can also imagine the oil workers who drilled
174
Part II: Getting Started 

the oil and the plastic workers who synthesized and then cast the plastic
for the steering wheel, dashboard, and other plastic components. Next,
you can imagine the engineers who designed your car and the autowork-
ers who put it together, part by part — and so on.
5. Take a few moments to appreciate these people.
Sure, they got paid for what they did, but they also contributed their pre-
cious life energy. Without their love, sweat, and dedication, you would
not have a car to drive. You may feel moved to thank them for their gifts.
As you can imagine, you could spend quite a few minutes reflecting on the
“innumerable labors” that brought you this car — or this computer or cell-
phone. The point, of course, is to reflect with gratitude and appreciation on
your interdependence — on all the many ways that you depend on the
energy and dedication and good intentions of others to make it through your
day. When you’ve spent some time reflecting in this way, you may find that
you see even simple things through fresh eyes.

Softening your belly
Stephen Levine, an American meditation
teacher who has written extensively on healing
and dying, counsels that the state of your belly
reflects the state of your heart. By consciously
softening your belly again and again, you can let
go and open to the tender feelings in your heart.
(The following meditation is adapted from his
book Guided Meditations, Explorations and
Healings.)
1. Begin by sitting comfortably and taking a
few deep breaths.
2. Allow your awareness to gradually settle
into your body.
Become aware of the sensations in your
head and slowly allow your awareness to
descend through your neck and shoulders
until you reach your torso and arms.
3. When you reach your belly, gently soften
this area of your body.
Consciously let go of any tension or holding.
4. Allow your breath to enter and leave your
belly.
When you inhale, your belly rises. When
you exhale, your belly falls.
5. With each breath, continue to soften your
belly.
Let go of any anger, fear, pain, or unresolved
grief you may be holding in your belly. You
may want to help the process along by
silently repeating a word or phrase like
“soften” or “let go.”
6. As you continue to soften your belly, notice
how your heart responds.
7. After five minutes or longer of this soft-
belly meditation, open your eyes and go
about your day.
Every now and then, check in with your
belly. If you notice that you’re tensing it
again, gently breathe and soften.

earning how to meditate is like learning to drive a car.
You can tool around the parking lot to your heart’s
content, but just wait ’til you hit rush hour.
In this part, I give you expert guidance in negotiating the
twists and turns of meditating in heavy internal traffic —
like when intense emotions or repetitive thinking threaten
to box you in. Or when detours and distractions seem to
throw you off course and you keep falling asleep at the
wheel. And you have a chance to piece together all your
newfound skills into a routine you can follow day after day.

M
editation tends to make you calmer, more spacious, and more relaxed —
at least most of the time. When you follow your breath, repeat a mantra,
or practice some other basic technique every day, your mind begins to settle
down naturally, while thoughts and feelings spontaneously bubble up and
release like the fizz in a bottle of soda. The process is so relaxing that the folks
in Transcendental Meditation call it unstressing.
When you meditate regularly for a period of time, however, you may find that
certain emotions or states of mind keep coming back to distract or disturb you.
Instead of dispersing, the same sexual fantasies, sad or fearful thoughts, or
painful memories may keep playing in your awareness like a CD stuck in the
same old groove. Or you may be meditating on lovingkindness (see Chapter 10)
but keep coming up against unresolved resentment or rage. Instead of watch-
ing the mist rising from the lake, you’ve begun your descent into the muddy
and sometimes turbulent waters of your inner experience. (Refer to Chapter 5
for a more detailed exploration of these waters.)
At first, you may be surprised, dismayed, or even frightened by what you
encounter, and you may conclude that you’re doing something wrong. But
have no fear! The truth is, your meditation has actually begun to deepen, and
you’re ready to expand your range of meditation techniques to help you navi-
gate this new terrain.

At this point, you may find it helpful to extend your practice of mindfulness
(see Chapter 6) from your breathing and your bodily sensations to your
thoughts and emotions. As you gently focus the light of your awareness on
this dimension of your experience, you can begin to sort out what’s actually
going on inside you. In the process, you can get to know yourself better —
even make friends with yourself. If you keep it up, you can eventually start to
penetrate and even unravel some old habitual patterns of thinking, feeling,
and behaving — patterns that have been causing you suffering and stress and
keeping you stuck for a long, long time. (For more on how the mind causes
suffering and stress, see Chapter 5.)
How to Make Friends 
with Your Experience
If you’re like most of the people I know (including me!), you tend to be excep-
tionally hard on yourself. In fact, you probably treat yourself in ways you
wouldn’t consider treating any of your loved ones or friends. When you make
a mistake, you may call yourself names or heap harsh judgments and criti-
cisms on yourself, including a laundry list of all the other mistakes you’ve
made over the years. When you feel some tender or vulnerable emotion, you
may dismiss it as weak or wimpy and attempt to push past it, rather then give
yourself time to feel it fully.
Just the other day, for example, when I couldn’t find my keys, I was startled to
hear this irritable, impatient voice inside my head chiding me for being so
stupid and forgetful! Sound familiar? Most of us hold some image of how we’re
supposed to act, think, and feel, and we’re constantly struggling to get our
experience and behavior to conform to it — and blaming ourselves when we
don’t.
In meditation, you have an opportunity to reverse this trend and explore
your experience just the way it is, without trying to judge it or change it.
(For more on reserving judgment and accepting what is, see Chapter 9.) To
replace the stress, conflict, and turbulence inside you with peace and har-
mony, you need to make friends with yourself — which means treating your-
self with the same kindness, care, and curiosity that you would give to a close
friend. You can begin by bringing a gentle, nonjudgmental awareness to your
thoughts and feelings.
180
Part III: Troubleshooting and Fine-Tuning 

Embracing your thoughts and feelings
When you’re familiar with following your breath and expanding your aware-
ness to include sensations (see Chapter 6), you can expand your awareness
even further to include thoughts, images, memories, and feelings. As with
sensations, begin by following your breath and then allow yourself to explore
a thought or feeling when it becomes so strong that it draws your attention to
it. When it no longer predominates in your field of awareness, gently return to
your breath.
Of course, if you’ve been meditating for a while, you may have noticed that
you’re constantly being carried away by the torrent of thoughts and feelings
that flood through your mind. One moment you’re counting or following your
breaths or practicing your mantra, the next moment you’re mulling over a
conversation you had yesterday or planning tomorrow’s dinner. It’s as though
you had inadvertently boarded a boat and suddenly found yourself several
miles downstream. When this happens, you simply need to notice that you’ve
wandered and immediately return to where you began.
Now, however, instead of viewing this dimension of your experience as a dis-
traction, you’re going to include it in your meditation with mindful aware-
ness. When you find your attention wandering off into a thought or feeling,
be aware of what you’re experiencing until it loses its intensity; then gently
return to your primary focus.
Naming your experience
As you expand your meditation to include thoughts and feelings, you may
find it helpful to practice naming, or noting, your experience. Begin with
mindful awareness of your breath and then start silently naming the in-breath
and out-breath. When you get really quiet and focused, you may even want to
include subtleties such as “long breath,” “short breath,” “deep breath,” “shal-
low breath,” and so on.
Keep the naming simple and subdued, like a gentle, nonjudgmental voice in
the back of your mind. As Buddhist meditation teacher Jack Kornfield says in
his book A Path with Heart, give “ninety-five percent of your energy to sensing
each experience, and five percent to a soft name in the background.”
When you become adept at naming your breath, you can extend the practice
to any strong sensations, thoughts, or feelings that draw your attention away
from your breath. For example, as you follow and name your breath, you may
find your focus interrupted by a prominent emotion. Name this experience
181
Chapter 11: Meditating with Challenging Emotions and Habitual Patterns

softly and repeatedly for as long as it persists — “sadness, sadness, sadness”
or “anger, anger, anger” — then gently return your attention to your breath.
Take the same approach with thoughts, images, and mind-states: “planning,
planning,” “worrying, worrying,” or “seeing, seeing.”
Use the simplest words you can find, and focus on one thing at a time. This
practice helps you gain a little perspective or distance from your constantly
changing inner experience, instead of becoming lost in the torrent.
By naming particular thoughts and emotions, you’re also acknowledging that
they exist. As I mentioned earlier, we often attempt to suppress or deny expe-
riences we deem undesirable or unacceptable, such as anger, fear, judgment,
or hurt. But the more you try to hide from your experience, the more it can
end up governing your behavior, as Freud so wisely pointed out more than a
century ago.
Naming allows you to shine the penetrating light of awareness into the
recesses of your heart and mind and invite your thoughts and feelings to
emerge from their hiding place, into the light of day. You may not like what
you encounter at first — but then you can name your self-judgments and self-
criticisms as well. Ultimately, you may notice that you’re not surprised any-
more by what you discover about yourself — and the more you make friends
with your own apparent shortcomings and frailties, the more you can open
your heart to the imperfections of others as well.
Welcoming whatever arises
When you become accustomed to including sensations, thoughts, and feelings
in your meditation, you can open your awareness gates wide and welcome
whatever arises, without judgment or resistance. Imagine that your mind is
like the sky, and inner and outer experiences come and go like clouds.
At first, you may find your attention drawn here and there, exploring one
object and then another. You don’t have to control your attention in any way;
just allow it to wander where it will, from thoughts to sensations to feelings
and back again.
Eventually, you may have periods in your meditation when your mind feels
spacious and expanded and doesn’t seem to be disturbed by thoughts, feel-
ings, or outside distractions. Whatever you experience, just keep opening
your awareness and welcoming whatever comes. (For more on the different
levels of experience you may encounter, see Chapter 5.)
182
Part III: Troubleshooting and Fine-Tuning 

A note of caution, however: This practice, though supremely simple, is actu-
ally quite advanced and requires well-developed powers of concentration to
sustain. It’s also difficult to teach — rather like riding a bicycle. First, you
have to discover what it feels like to hold your balance; then you just keep
returning to the balance point whenever you start to fall off.
How to Meditate with Challenging
Emotions
As a psychotherapist, meditator, and meditation teacher, I’ve discovered a
thing or two over the years about how people relate to the mysterious and
sometimes formidable world of human emotions. For one thing, many people
believe they have a Pandora’s box of ugly, disgusting emotions like rage, jeal-
ousy, hatred, and terror hidden inside them, and they’re afraid that if they
open it up, these demonic energies will overwhelm them and those they love.
For another thing, they tend to think that these “negative” feelings are bot-
tomless and irresolvable, and they’re better off avoiding them, no matter how
painful it may be to hold them in.
Unfortunately, you pay a steep price indeed if you spend your life resisting
and denying your feelings. Unacknowledged negative feelings can impede the
flow of more positive feelings like love and joy. As a result, you may end up
feeling lonely because you lack close emotional contact with others, and you
may be unable to give and receive love when you have an opportunity to do
so. In addition, negative feelings that build up inside you tend to cause stress,
suppress the immune system, and contribute to stress-related ailments like
ulcers, cancer, and heart disease. They also hold valuable life energy that you
might otherwise channel in constructive or creative ways. Besides, emotions
that are persistently suppressed and denied have an annoying habit of burst-
ing forth inappropriately, when you least expect them, prompting you to do
and say things you may later regret.
Of course, some people go to another extreme and seem to be so completely
awash in powerful emotional reactions that they can’t make simple decisions
or carry on a rational conversation. But these people aren’t really experiencing
their emotions, they’re indulging them and allowing them to run their lives.
Meditation offers you an alternative way of relating with your emotions.
Instead of suppressing, indulging, or exploding, you can directly experience
your emotions as they are — as an interplay of thoughts, images, and sensa-
tions. When you’ve become skillful at following your breath and expanding
your awareness to include the flow of thoughts and feelings — which may
183
Chapter 11: Meditating with Challenging Emotions and Habitual Patterns

take months or even years — you can focus your attention on particular emo-
tions that you find challenging or problematic and develop penetrating insight
into the nature of the experience.
Instead of being bottomless or endless, as some people fear, you may find
that even the most powerful emotions come in waves that have a limited
duration when you experience them fully. As one of my teachers used to say,
“What you resist persists” — and what you welcome has a tendency to let go
and release. (See the sidebar “Facing your demons” later in this chapter.)
Here are some guidelines for exploring a few of the most common emotions.
Although feelings come in many shapes and sizes, I’ve found that they’re all
more or less variants or combinations of a few basic ones: anger, fear, sad-
ness, joy, excitement, and desire. (In my view, love is deeper than emotion;
it’s a fundamental expression of being itself.) Just as an artist’s rich palette of
colors can ultimately be broken down into cyan, magenta, and yellow, the dif-
ficult or challenging emotions like jealousy, guilt, boredom, and depression
are combinations (or reactions) to four basic feelings: anger, fear, sadness,
and desire. (If you find a certain feeling problematic, work on it as you would
one of these four. For more on desire, see Chapter 12.)
Meditating with anger
After practicing meditation regularly for several years in my twenties, I
prided myself on being consistently calm and even-tempered and never get-
ting angry. Then one day, my girlfriend at the time confessed that she’d had
an affair with another man! Without hesitating, I picked up a cup from the
table and threw it against the wall. I remember being startled by the sudden
intensity of my emotions. One moment I seemed perfectly peaceful, and the
next moment I was flying into a rage. My anger may have been appropriate to
the circumstances, but I certainly hadn’t expressed it skillfully. Humbled, I
headed back to the meditation cushion for some deeper investigation — after
breaking up with my girlfriend, of course.
Many people, especially women, have a taboo against getting angry because
they weren’t allowed to express their anger, even as children. So they expend
enormous amounts of energy trying to skirt around the feeling. Other people
seem as though they’re perpetually seething with current anger and old
resentments, although they may not realize it themselves.
When you meditate with your anger, you might begin by noticing where and
how you experience it in your body. Where do you find yourself tensing and
contracting? What happens to your breathing? Where do you notice a buildup
of energy? How does it affect softer emotions? As you continue to be aware of
your anger, do you notice it shifting or changing in any way? How long does it
last? Does it have a beginning and an end?
184
Part III: Troubleshooting and Fine-Tuning 

Next, you can turn your attention to your mind. What kinds of thoughts and
images accompany the angry feelings? Do you find yourself blaming other
people and defending yourself? If you investigate further and peel back the
initial layer of anger, what do you find underneath? In my experience, anger
generally arises in response to one of two deeper emotions: hurt or fear.
When you’re hurt, as I was by my girlfriend’s betrayal, you may lash out in
anger against the one you believe hurt you. And when you’re afraid, you may
protect yourself with the sword and armor of anger rather than acknowledge
your fear, even to yourself. Beneath the hurt and fear, anger generally masks
an even deeper layer of attachment to having things be a certain way. When
circumstances change or don’t go according to plan, you feel hurt or afraid
and then angry in response.
With anger, as with all emotions, set aside any judgment or resistance you
might have and face the anger directly. You may find that it becomes more
intense before it releases, but stay with it. Beneath the anger may lie deep
wellsprings of power, which you may eventually discover how to evoke with-
out getting angry.
Meditating with fear and anxiety
Many people are reluctant to admit they’re afraid, even to themselves.
Somehow, they believe that if they acknowledge their fear, they give it power
to run their lives. In other words, deep down, they’re afraid of their fear! Men
especially will often go to great lengths to hide their fears or anxieties behind
185
Chapter 11: Meditating with Challenging Emotions and Habitual Patterns
Facing your demons
The Tibetans tell a wonderful story about the
great meditation master Milarepa, who lived
about 900 years ago. Milarepa sought out
remote caves high in the Himalayas where he
practiced meditation. Once, he found himself in
a cave inhabited by a company of demons that
distracted him from his practice. (Demons
apparently frequented caves in those days —
looking for some action, no doubt!)
First, he tried to subdue them, but they wouldn’t
budge. Then he decided to honor them and
extend friendliness and compassion to them,
and half of them left. The rest he welcomed
wholeheartedly and invited to return whenever
they wished. At this invitation, all but one par-
ticularly ferocious demon vanished like a rain-
bow. With no concern for his own body and with
utmost love and compassion, Milarepa went up
to the demon and placed his head in its mouth
as an offering. The demon disappeared without
a trace and never returned.
Consider the story of Milarepa the next 
time you’re struggling with your own inner
demons — emotions and states of mind you find
challenging or unpleasant. Imagine what might
happen if you welcomed them instead of trying
to drive them away!

a facade of confidence or anger or rationality. At the other extreme, of
course, some people seem to be afraid of just about everything.
The truth is, if you’re human — and not bionic or extraterrestrial — you’re
going to be afraid or anxious, at least occasionally. In addition to the raw rush
of adrenaline you feel when your physical survival seems to be at stake, you
experience the fear that inevitably arises when you face the unknown or the
uncertain in life — which can be quite often these days. Ultimately, you’re
afraid because you believe that you’re a separate, isolated entity surrounded
by forces beyond your control. The more the walls that separate you from
others crumble through the practice of meditation, the more your fear and anx-
iety naturally diminish. (For more on separation and isolation, see Chapter 5.)
As with anger, you can use your meditation to explore and ultimately make
friends with your fear. After all, it’s just an emotion like other emotions, com-
posed of physical sensations, thoughts, and beliefs. When working with fear,
it’s especially important to be kind and gentle with yourself.
Begin by asking the same questions you asked about anger: Where and how
do you experience it in your body? Where do you find yourself tensing and
contracting? What happens to your breathing? Or to your heart? Next, notice
the thoughts and images that accompany the fear. Often fear arises from
anticipating the future and imagining that you’ll somehow be unable to cope.
When you see these catastrophic expectations for what they are and return
to the present moment — the sensations in your body, the coming and going
of your breath — you may find that the fear shifts and begins to disperse.
Then when it returns, you can simply call its name — “fear, fear, fear” — like
an old, familiar friend.
You may also want to amplify the sensations a little and allow yourself
to shake or tremble, if you feel so inclined. You can even imagine the fear
overwhelming you and doing its worst (knowing, of course, that you will 
survive) — an especially helpful approach if you’re afraid of your fear, as so
many people are. Facing your fear directly without trying to get rid of it or
escape from it requires tremendous courage; yet these practices also have
the capacity to bring you into the present moment and open your heart to
your own vulnerability.
Meditating with sadness, 
grief, and depression
Most people find sadness easier to feel and express than anger or fear.
Unfortunately, they don’t give it the time and attention it deserves because
they were told as children to stop crying before they were ready. Life
inevitably presents us with a series of disappointments and losses; unex-
pressed sadness and grief can build up inside and ultimately lead to depres-
sion. (Many of the people I see in therapy suffer from mild depression, which
186
Part III: Troubleshooting and Fine-Tuning 

may also result from repressed anger or “learned helplessness.” For more on
learned helplessness, see Chapter 5.)
To make friends with your sadness, you need to hold it gently and lovingly
and give it plenty of space to express itself. As with anger and fear, begin by
exploring the sensations. Perhaps you notice a heaviness in your heart or a
constriction in your diaphragm or a clogged sensation in your eyes and fore-
head, as though you’re about to cry but can’t. You may want to amplify these
sensations and see what happens.
Then pay attention to the thoughts, images, and memories that fuel the sad-
ness. Perhaps you keep reliving the loss of a loved one or the moment when a
close friend said something unkind to you. If you’re depressed, you may keep
recycling the same negative, self-defeating beliefs and judgments, such as
“I’m not good enough” or “I don’t have what it takes to succeed.”
As you open your awareness to include the full range of experiences associated
with the sadness, you may shed some heartfelt tears — and in the process feel
yourself lightening up and your sadness lifting a little. (To find out how to work
with core beliefs, consult the following two sections of this chapter.) Ultimately,
as long as you’re open to your own suffering and the suffering of others, you
will experience a certain amount of tender sadness in your heart.
How to Unravel Habitual Patterns —
with Awareness
As you explore your emotions (as described in the previous section), you
may gradually discover that they’re not as overpowering or as endless as you
feared. With mindful awareness and naming, most emotions will flow through
your body and gradually release. For example, as you gently investigate your
anger or fear, it may intensify at first, then break and disperse like a wave on
the beach.
But certain persistent emotions and physical contractions, along with the
thoughts and images that accompany and fuel them, seem to keep returning,
no matter how many times you notice and name them. These are the stories
and habitual patterns that run deep in the body-mind like the roots from
which recurring thoughts and feelings spring. (For more on these stories, see
Chapter 5.) In your meditations, you may keep replaying a story from your
past (including all the accompanying emotions and mind-states) in which you
suffer some abuse or injustice. Perhaps you see yourself as a failure and fan-
tasize obsessively about an imaginary future in which you’re somehow hap-
pier and more successful. Or you may worry repeatedly about your job or
relationship because you believe you can’t trust people or the world’s not a
safe place.

Chapter 11: Meditating with Challenging Emotions and Habitual Patterns

In his book A Path with Heart, Buddhist meditation teacher Jack Kornfield
calls these habitual patterns insistent visitors and suggests that they keep
returning in your meditation (and your life!) because they’re stuck or unfin-
ished in some way. When you give them the loving attention and deeper
investigation they require (applying the penetrating insight I discuss at
length in Chapter 5), you may at first discover that they’re more complex and
deeply rooted than you had imagined. But with persistent exploration, they
gradually unravel and reveal the hidden energy and wisdom they contain. In
fact, the more you undo your patterns, the more you release the physical and
energetic contractions that lie at their heart, and the freer, more spacious,
more expansive — and, yes, healthier! — you become.
Here’s a brief synopsis of the primary techniques for unraveling habitual pat-
terns. Experiment with them on your own, and if you find them helpful, feel
free to incorporate them into your meditation. If you get stuck or would like
to delve deeper but don’t know how, you may want to find yourself a medita-
tion teacher or psychotherapist familiar with this approach. (For more on
finding a therapist, see the section “How [and When] to Seek Help with Your
Patterns” later in this chapter. For more on finding a teacher, see Chapter 13.
And for a more detailed treatment of many of these techniques, check out A
Path with Heart by Jack Kornfield.)
Naming your “tunes”
As a rather humorous way to start, advises Kornfield, you can name and
number your “top ten tunes.” (You can stop at five, if you prefer.) Then when
a particular tune recurs, you can simply notice and name it without getting
embroiled once again in the same painful pattern. Merely another version of
naming your experience (described earlier), this approach can be helpful but
only takes you so far.
Expanding your awareness
The part of the pattern that reveals itself to you in your meditation may be
just the tip of the proverbial iceberg. Perhaps you keep feeling tense in your
lower belly and you don’t know why. If you expand your awareness, you may
discover that beneath the surface lies fear about the future, and under the
fear lies a layer of hurt. When you include thoughts and ideas as well, you
may find that, deep down, you believe you’re inadequate. So you’re afraid
you can’t cope, and you feel hurt when people criticize you because it just
corroborates your own negative self-image. By welcoming the full range of
thoughts, images, and feelings, you create an inner spaciousness in which the
pattern can gradually unfold and release. (Trust me — this approach actually
works, though you won’t get results instantaneously!)
188
Part III: Troubleshooting and Fine-Tuning 

Feeling your feelings
Patterns often persist until the underlying feelings are thoroughly felt. That’s
right, I said felt — not merely acknowledged or named! Many people keep their
feelings at arm’s length or confuse them with thoughts or ideas. I could talk in
the abstract about grief or fear, but it took years of meditation (and some skill-
ful therapy; see the section “How [and When] to Seek Help with Your Patterns”)
before I knew how they actually felt in my body. Other people (as I mention 
earlier, in the section “How to Meditate with Challenging Emotions”) get com-
pletely entangled in their feelings. As you expand your awareness, ask yourself,
“What feelings haven’t I felt yet?”
Feeling your feelings doesn’t make them bigger or worse — at least not in the
long run. It actually allows them to move through and release!
Noticing your resistance and attachment
As I mentioned earlier, what you resist persists — to which I might add that
what you’re attached to persists as well. If a particular story or challenging
emotion keeps replaying in your mind, you might explore your relationship to
it. For example, you might ask: How do I feel about this particular pattern or
story? Do I have a vested interest in holding on to it? If so, what do I get out
of it? Or what am I afraid might happen if I let it go? Am I judging it as undesir-
able and struggling to get rid of it? If so, what don’t I like about it? When you
can relax and gently open to accept the pattern with awareness (as described
in the previous sections), you may find that the pattern, which felt so tight
and entrenched, relaxes as well.
Finding the wisdom
Sometimes recurring stories or patterns have a message to impart, and they
won’t stop nagging until you listen. If I keep having the same uncomfortable
or difficult feeling during meditation and it doesn’t shift or change with
awareness, I may “give it a voice” and ask it to speak to me as though it were
a close friend. “What are you trying to tell me?” I may ask. “What am I need-
ing to hear?” Sometimes I discover that a tender, vulnerable part of myself
needs caring, nurturing attention. At other times, I hear the voice of responsi-
bility reminding me to tend to some important commitment. (For a helpful
way of listening to these voices and parts, see the sidebar “Focusing: Western
meditation for getting unstuck” later in this chapter.)

Part III: Troubleshooting and Fine-Tuning 
Replacing negative patterns with positive energy
Many meditative traditions suggest invoking
outside help in the lifelong process of purifying
and eliminating habitual patterns. No, I’m not
talking about psychotherapy or Prozac here —
I’m referring to spiritual beings or energies that
purportedly exist for the sole purpose of inspir-
ing and encouraging your spiritual evolution.
Western religions have their angels and saints,
Hinduism and Buddhism have their deities and
protectors, shamanism has its spirit helpers and
animal powers.
Now, you may not buy all this spiritual stuff, but
I’d suggest giving this exercise a try just the
same. In place of spiritual allies, you may want
to imagine people who have given you uncon-
ditional support in the past — or you could just
stick to the image of a luminous sphere. The
point is, this exercise by itself can be a power-
ful ally in the process of dealing with painful or
difficult emotions or experiences. As with all
meditations, the more you practice it, the more
effective it becomes. (For detailed audio
instructions, check out Track 9 on the CD.)
1. Begin by sitting down and meditating in
your usual way for several minutes.
If you don’t have a usual way, you can find
one in Chapter 6 — or just sit quietly and
wait for further instructions.
2. Imagine a luminous sphere of white light
suspended about a foot above your head
and slightly in front of you.
Like a sun, this sphere embodies and radi-
ates all the positive, healing, harmonious
qualities you most want to manifest in your
life right now. (You may want to be specific
at first — strength, clarity, peace, love;
eventually, you can just flash on the light.)
3. Imagine yourself soaking up all these qual-
ities with the healing light as though you
were sunbathing.
4. Imagine this light radiating in all directions
to the farthest corners of the universe and
drawing the energy of all the benevolent
forces that support your growth and evolu-
tion back into the sphere.
5. Visualize this positive, healing energy
shining from the sphere, like the light of a
thousand suns, streaming down through
your body and mind, eliminating all nega-
tivity and tension, darkness and depres-
sion, worry and anxiety and replacing them
with radiance, vitality, peace, and all the
other positive qualities you seek.
6. Continue to imagine this powerful, healing
light flooding every cell and molecule of
your being, dissolving any contractions and
stuck places you may be aware of and
leaving you clean, clear, and calm.
7. Visualize this luminous sphere gradually
descending into your heart, where it con-
tinues to radiate this powerful light.
8. Imagine yourself as a luminous being 
with a sphere of light in your heart that
constantly radiates clarity, harmony, and
purity — first to every cell and particle of
your own being and then, through you, to
every other being in every direction.
You can carry the feelings and images this
exercise evokes throughout the rest of 
your day.

Getting to the heart of the matter
Like the great Tibetan meditator Milarepa (see the sidebar “Facing your
demons” earlier in this chapter), sometimes you need to stick your head into
the demon’s mouth before it disappears for good. In other words, you may
need to explore the energetic contraction that lies at the heart of your pattern.
(When I use the term energetic here, I’m referring to the Eastern model of the
human organism as a system of energetic pathways and centers that can get
blocked or contracted. These blockages give rise to painful emotions and
mind-states and may ultimately cause disease. For more on energy pathways
and centers, see Chapter 12.)
To explore the energetic contraction at the heart of your pattern, you can
gently direct your awareness into the very center of the contraction and
describe in detail what you find there. When you unearth the memory, feeling,
or belief that holds the pattern together, you may find that the contraction
releases, your awareness expands, and your meditation begins to flow more
smoothly. (Note: When you’re dealing with exceptionally painful, deep-seated
contractions, you may want to consult a qualified professional. See the section
in this chapter “How [and When] to Seek Help with Your Patterns.”)
Infusing the stuck place with being
After you’ve meditated for a while and received some glimpses of your own
inherent wholeness and completeness (which I call being in Chapter 1), you
may want to try the following shortcut. Set aside the thoughts and ideas that
accompany your pattern and simply be aware of the physical and energetic
contraction. Now shift your attention to your wholeness and completeness,
which you may experience as a calm, relaxed energy in your body; a deeply
loving feeling in your heart; a sense of expansiveness or space; or some other
feeling unique to you. Imagine your wholeness and completeness gradually
spreading, penetrating, and infusing the contraction with pure being. Continue
this exercise as the contraction releases and dissolves into being. (For an even
more powerful version of this technique, refer to the sidebar “Replacing nega-
tive patterns with positive energy.”)
Working with patterns 
before you get stuck
When you get the knack of observing your reactive patterns and repetitive sto-
ries and concerns and unraveling them in meditation, you can begin to work
191
Chapter 11: Meditating with Challenging Emotions and Habitual Patterns

with them as they arise in everyday life. For example, you may notice in 
your meditation that you tend to rehearse a drama in which other people 
are constantly depriving you of what you rightfully deserve and you end up
feeling hurt and resentful. When you notice this story and the beliefs that
accompany it (for example, “I never get what I want” or “Nobody cares about
me”) showing up in your relationships or at work, you can use the skills you’ve
acquired to step back a little and resist the temptation to get sucked in as
usual.
The more consistently you unravel your patterns in meditation, the more
quickly you can catch them as they arise — and the freer and less reactive
you gradually become. Eventually, you can even begin to shift your identity
from the patterns to the spacious awareness in which the patterns arise and
pass away.
192
Part III: Troubleshooting and Fine-Tuning 
Working with habitual patterns: A case in point
Here’s an example of how to work with habitual
patterns, based on my own experience. Not
long ago, I noticed a particular tightness in my
lower abdomen, not only when I meditated but
also between sessions. When the tightness per-
sisted for several days, I decided to investigate
it further. Gently, I directed my awareness and
my breath to the area.
As I expanded my awareness, I noticed that I
also felt tight in my throat and jaw. When I
inquired into the feeling, I gradually became
aware that I was afraid of something, though I
wasn’t sure at first of what. Not only that, I was
resisting the feeling by tightening my jaw.
Somehow I didn’t like the feeling and wanted to
get rid of it.
Without trying to change the feeling in any way,
I meditated and breathed with it for a while.
Soon, it began to loosen a little, but not to
unravel completely. Then I gently asked for
more information, and I realized that I was
afraid of an upcoming presentation. Several
memories of being made to feel inadequate as a
child came vividly to mind, and I experienced
waves of sadness and some tears, followed by
compassion for myself.
Now, as I directed my awareness to the center
of the contraction in my belly, it quickly
released, and feelings of ease and well-being
filled the area instead. Feeling more relaxed and
expanded, I returned to my usual meditation.
Several days later, when I made the presenta-
tion, I noticed that I felt more relaxed and self-
confident than usual.

How to Set Patterns Aside — for Now
If you find that your habitual patterns are too deeply entrenched to unravel
(at least for now!), you can still get some temporary relief by applying one or
more of the following techniques.
You don’t necessarily have to wrestle a pattern to the mat for the count of
ten; sometimes you just have to get it to shift or budge a little so that you can
get on with your meditation.
Letting go — or letting be
Believe it or not, you may be able to drop the pattern and move on. Be care-
ful, though — if you’re actually trying to push it away, it may come back to
haunt you. Instead of struggle and aversion, this approach requires a willing-
ness to accept things the way they are. (For more on the stages of letting go,
see Chapter 9.) Sometimes you can just stop, be aware of the contraction,
and gradually relax your body until the contraction releases. (For detailed
instructions on how to relax deeply, see Chapter 6.) Or you can shift your
awareness to being itself (however you may happen to experience being), and
just let the pattern be without trying to change it.
Shifting attention
As the Bible says, “There’s a time for every purpose under heaven” — 
including working with your habitual patterns. If you’re preoccupied with
more-pressing concerns, you may need to be able to set your patterns aside
and shine your attention where you need it most. You can come back to your
difficulties later, when you have the time and energy.
Moving the energy
Sometimes you may find it helpful to direct the energy bound up in a particu-
lar pattern into another activity. Go for a run or dance to loud music or wash
the dishes. You may not be unraveling the pattern, but you’re stealing its
thunder, so to speak. (To continue the metaphor, you can even use the rain 
to water your crops.) Perhaps you’ve seen one of those westerns where the
hero goes out and chops some wood instead of picking up his gun and shoot-
ing his neighbors. Well, he’s “moving the energy,” whether he knows it or not.
193
Chapter 11: Meditating with Challenging Emotions and Habitual Patterns

You can also move the energy internally — for example, by turning your fear
about an upcoming event into excitement and curiosity.
Acting it out in imagination
When an emotion or impulse seems too intense to shift or move, you can act
it out in your meditation by imagining yourself exaggerating it and then allow-
ing it to unfold completely with mindful attention. This approach differs from
mere fantasy, which tends to have an obsessive, unconscious quality. Instead,
by paying attention as you give this emotion or pattern free rein, you get to
realize that it’s not as overpowering as you may have believed.
At the same time, you have an opportunity to observe its limitations and the
damage or pain it could inflict. For example, you could imagine yourself enact-
ing your rage or your desire mindfully and notice what happens. Does it com-
pletely overwhelm you? How does it affect the other people involved? Does it
really bring you the fulfillment you seek?
Acting it out in real life — mindfully
When a pattern just seems too powerful to resist, you can act it out in life, as
you usually do, but this time with mindfulness. Notice how you feel in your
body as you follow the enactment through to completion. For example, you
may be bravely trying to resist your desire for a hot fudge sundae but rapidly
losing your willpower. Instead, you may go for it while noticing every bite and
every sensation, both during and after. In fact, you can even try eating as
much as you want. I guarantee that you’ll transform your relationship to hot
fudge sundaes in the process. (For more on mindfulness in everyday life, see
Chapter 15.)
194
Part III: Troubleshooting and Fine-Tuning 
Focusing: Western meditation for getting unstuck
Here’s a meditation technique called focusing
developed by Eugene Gendlin, a psychology
professor at the University of Chicago, to help
folks like you and me figure out where we’re
stuck and effect the necessary changes, both
inner and outer. (Although this technique uses
the same term, it differs from the focused atten-
tion described elsewhere in this book.)
By focusing on your felt sense about a 
problem — the place in your body where you
hold it and know it — you can discover valuable
information about who you are and what you
really want and need. (For more-detailed instruc-
tions, I recommend Gendlin’s book Focusing.)
1. Begin by taking a few moments to settle
comfortably and relax.

195
Chapter 11: Meditating with Challenging Emotions and Habitual Patterns
2. Check in with that place inside where you
feel things and ask, “How am I doing?
What doesn’t feel quite right? What do I
need to pay attention to right now?”
You’re not looking for an intense emotion
but something subtler and more elusive: a
felt sense. (For example, a felt sense is the
place inside that you consult when some-
one asks you, “What is your sense of that
person or situation?” It’s not a feeling,
exactly, and definitely not a thought, but
more like a bodily knowing.)
3. Take whatever you get, set it aside, and ask
the same questions again until you have a
list of three or four things you might focus
on right now.
4. Choose one, but don’t go inside it. Instead,
allow some space around it.
Set aside any thoughts and analyses you
may have and just be with your felt sense of
this one thing, in its entirety.
5. Ask yourself, “What is the crux of this
problem?”
Don’t jump to any conclusions or try to
understand it. Just allow this crux to
emerge in the silence. You may find that
what you get is different from what your
mind expected. You’ll know it in your body.
6. Sit with the crux of this felt sense for a
minute or more and allow a word, image,
or feeling to emerge from it.
Don’t try to understand it. Just be aware of
the crux with gentle curiosity, waiting for a
deeper knowing to reveal itself.
7. Compare this word, image, or feeling with
the felt sense in your body, asking “Is this
right? Does this really fit?”
If it is, you’ll notice a felt shift: a deep breath,
sigh of relief, or slight relaxing inside. If not,
ask the felt sense, “Then what does feel
right?” and wait for an answer. Remember:
You’re asking your body, not your mind, for
information.
8. When you receive an answer that feels
right, sit with it in silence for a few
moments and allow your body to respond.
The felt shift may continue to unfold, or you
may experience a release of energy or
some other noticeable reverberation in your
body.
Here’s an example of focusing. Say that you’ve
been obsessing about a conversation you had
yesterday with a friend, playing it over and over
again in your mind without resolution. So, you
decide to set your thoughts aside and pay atten-
tion to your inner felt sense of the conversation.
When you turn inward, you find that the felt
sense is localized in your heart and the crux of
it turns out to be something about your friend’s
tone of voice.
As you sit with the felt sense, you realize that the
crux of the problem is not her tone of voice
exactly, but it’s something that was triggered in
you. What is it? Well, it’s a feeling of jealousy . . .
no, that’s not quite right; it’s a sense of not quite
measuring up, of not being as good as she is —
or even more accurately, of not doing what you
really love, the way she does. That’s it, you’re
aware that you’re not doing what you really
want to do with your life, and your friend’s
words triggered that sense inside you.
With this realization, you notice a felt shift or
release inside, possibly accompanied by tears
of recognition and sadness. You’ve just com-
pleted a round of focusing, and you can use the
same technique for any other problem or felt
sense.

How (and When) to Seek 
Help with Your Patterns
Perhaps you’re so full of negative thoughts and feelings that you find it virtu-
ally impossible to concentrate, even in meditation. The voices (or images) in
your head keep spewing forth worries, regrets, judgments, and criticism with
such volume and velocity that you can barely hear yourself think. Or maybe
you can focus on your breath or recite your mantra with some success, but
when a particularly compelling story or pattern gets triggered, you’re swept
away by the intensity.
My first suggestion is to keep meditating regularly and see what happens.
How do you feel after a few weeks or months of steady practice? Are you
making any headway? Do you feel more calm and peaceful? Does your con-
centration deepen?
If certain patterns persist, however — especially if they interfere with your
capacity to do your work or maintain loving, satisfying relationships — you
might consider psychotherapy. Now, I know that some people still feel a little
embarrassed or ashamed if they admit they need help with their problems. But
look at it this way: People have been consulting medicine men and women,
shamans, rabbis, priests, and local elders for as long as human beings have
had problems — maybe longer.
The thing is, psychotherapy (our modern, secular version of wise counsel)
comes in many shapes and sizes — as many, in fact, as the professionals who
practice it. Without devaluing any particular brand of psychotherapy (after
all, I’m talking about my own profession here), I’d like to offer a few guide-
lines for choosing a therapist who can help free you from the limitations of
your habitual patterns. Admittedly, I base these recommendations on my
own particular interests and preferences — and on more than 20 years as a
therapist and 35 years as a meditator and meditation teacher.
Talk is important — but 
you need to do more
Even classical Freudian therapy, which consists entirely of talk, aims for the
moment when the insights touch a deeper place and trigger an inner-felt shift
or emotional release. (Remember the crucial point in the movie Good Will
Hunting when Robin Williams tells Matt Damon, “It wasn’t your fault”?) The
problem is, talk-only therapy gets there more slowly — and sometimes not at
196
Part III: Troubleshooting and Fine-Tuning 

all. Unless you happen to have a Robin Williams nearby, find a therapist who
combines talk with one or more techniques that take you deeper faster — for
example, hypnotherapy, guided imagery, active imagination, sand play, body-
centered therapy, breathwork, focusing, or eye movement desensitization
and reprocessing (EMDR).
Shop around
If you want the names of appropriate therapists, turn first to friends, family
members, or others who share similar interests or values. Don’t be shy —
you may be surprised to discover how many people you know have seen a
shrink in recent years. Then call these therapists and spend some time talk-
ing with them over the phone. Remember, you have a right to ask them any-
thing you want to know. You might even schedule a session or two with each
one before making your decision. After all, you’re better off spending a couple
of hundred bucks now on trial runs than discovering in six months or a year
that you made a mistake.
Choose the person, not the credentials
Even though the therapist comes highly recommended and the office wall is
covered with degrees and certificates, check this person out. Does the thera-
pist listen to you carefully and hear what you say? Does he or she seem emo-
tionally attuned as well as insightful? Do you feel comfortable in his or her
presence? Do you trust this person with your most tender places and difficult
issues? In the final analysis, you need to trust your feelings and your intuition
on this one.
Decide whether spirituality matters to you
If you have a particular spiritual orientation — or are in the process of devel-
oping one — you may want to search out a therapist who comes similarly
equipped. If you don’t have a large enough selection to choose from, at least
find a shrink who honors spirituality, rather than debunking it. Not only will
he or she be open to talking with you about meditation and transpersonal
(that is, beyond the personal) experiences, he or she may be able to help you
combine meditation with therapy to work on your issues more effectively.

sonal experiences, see Chapter 12.

Checking in with your inner child
When you’re feeling agitated or upset, you may
want to check in with the little child inside you,
the part of you that feels things deeply. Here’s a
meditation to help reassure and nurture your
inner child.
1. Begin by noticing what you’re feeling and
where you’re feeling it.
2. Take some time to breathe and relax into
the feelings.
3. Imagine that there’s a little boy or girl
inside you having these feelings.
This child is the young, undeveloped part of
you. You may have an image or just a gut
sense or inner knowing.
4. Ask yourself these questions: “How old is
this child? What is this child’s name? What
kind of attention does this child want from
me right now?”
The child may want to be reassured or held,
or he or she may just want to play.
5. If possible, imagine giving the child what
he or she wants.
6. Continue to commune with this child for as
long as you like, giving and receiving
words or physical contact, as appropriate.
7. When you’re done, notice how you feel.
You may be more relaxed or confident — or
at least less upset or afraid.
8. Be sure to give your inner child a hug (if the
child feels comfortable receiving one), tell
the child that you love him or her, and reas-
sure the child that you’ll check in with him
or her again from time to time — and
please do!

Troubleshooting the Roadblocks
and Side Effects
In This Chapter
 Using the obstacles to your meditation as grist for your mill

 Exploring your seven energy centers and what they have to teach you
L
ike any journey, meditation can have its share of breathtaking vistas and
roadside attractions that inspire you and pique your curiosity — and it
can also present obstacles, detours, and breakdowns that keep you from
moving forward. As I mention in Chapter 1, I like to think of this book as a
detailed travel guide. The present chapter provides a troubleshooting manual
to use when you encounter engine trouble, a flat tire, or an unexpected delay.
Of course, you may just breeze along and get where you’re headed with nary
a glitch in your itinerary. If you’re doing just fine in your meditation, you’re
welcome to skip this chapter for now. But if you want a preview of the obsta-
cles you may face — or some suggestions for the obstacles you’ve already
started to face! — then read on. You can pick up some helpful tips for dealing
with the most common roadblocks when they get in your way, and you’ll find
descriptions of scenic way stations that could turn into detours if you get
confused and don’t know how to negotiate them carefully.
How to Navigate the Roadblocks 
on Your Meditative Journey
Although meditation can be as complex as you want it to be, the basic prac-
tice (as I mention in Chapter 1) is actually quite simple: Just sit down, be
quiet, turn your attention inward, and focus your mind. Nobody ever said it
would be easy, however — not all the time, anyway!

In addition to the difficult emotions and habitual patterns I describe in
Chapter 11, every persistent meditator inevitably encounters at least a few 
of the many classical roadblocks or obstacles. (Don’t be put off by the word
obstacle. These challenges may slow you down, but they don’t need to stop
you.) You’re not doing something wrong when you get sleepy or restless or
bored or keep putting off your meditation or wonder whether it’s worth the
effort. In fact, you’re merely confronting more of the habitual patterns that
cause you problems in every area of your life. Meditation offers a laboratory
in which to investigate these patterns with mindful attention so you can
apply your results in your work, your friendships, or your family life. (The
“obstacles,” in other words, provide grist for the mill of self-awareness and
behavioral change.)
As I encourage throughout this book, be sure to treat yourself and the road-
blocks that arise on your journey with the same kindness, care, and curiosity
that you would give to a close friend. The point is not to push through road-
blocks to some loftier place of clarity and repose. Rather, the obstacles them-
selves provide exceptional raw material for your lab work as you discover
how to open to whatever arises in your experience with gentle, nonjudgmen-
tal awareness. Instead of obstacles, you might prefer to think of them as mes-
sengers bearing the gifts of increased energy, wisdom, and self-acceptance.
As I describe in Chapter 11, it can be helpful to begin by naming your experi-
ence before proceeding to further exploration.
Sleepiness
Most of us sleepwalk through much of our lives, paying only minimal atten-
tion to what’s happening around us. Have you ever driven home and won-
dered, when you arrived, how you got there? Because the point of meditation
is to wake up and be mindful, it’s no wonder that all meditators contend with
dullness and dreaminess at least occasionally.
Probably the most common roadblock, sleepiness comes in a number of
shapes and sizes. Begin by exploring your experience: Where do you feel the
sleepiness in your body? What happens to your mind? Are you physically
tired or just mentally dull? You may be yawning because you haven’t slept
well in days — in which case, stop meditating and take a nap.
More often, though, your mind will become foggy when you’re resisting feel-
ing some unpleasant or undesirable emotion like fear or sadness. You might
ask yourself, “What am I avoiding right now? What lies just beneath the sur-
face of this sleepiness?” (You could even extend this inquiry to the other
moments of your life when you dull out or glaze over.)
200
Part III: Troubleshooting and Fine-Tuning 

Once you’ve been meditating for a while, you may find that you get sleepy
when your mind settles down and no longer has lots of stimulation to keep it
occupied. At this point, you may need to rouse your energy by opening your
eyes wide and sitting up straight. If your sleepiness persists, you can get up
and walk around or splash cold water on your face to help you stay awake.
Restlessness
When you have difficulty paying attention in your meditation because your
mind is agitated, worried, or anxious and you’re eager to get on with other
activities, you can begin by naming the restlessness and noticing how you
experience it in your body. Perhaps you’re tensing in your belly or head or
have an uneasy feeling in your arms and legs. Maybe you notice that you’re
perched uncomfortably on the edge of your cushion, as though you were
ready to jump off at any moment and grab a bite to eat or make a phone call.
Notice also what your mind is doing. Does it skip uncontrollably from topic to
topic or worry obsessively about some upcoming event or responsibility? As
much as possible, observe your restlessness without getting caught by the
agitation — or seduced by the impulse to get up and go. You may also want
to practice counting your breaths or some other concentration technique to
help quiet your mind until you can resume your regular practice (or perhaps
that is your regular practice). Like sleepiness, restlessness can also be a
response to painful or unpleasant feelings you don’t want to experience.
Boredom
Like most people, you may believe you get bored because the object of your
attention lacks value or interest. But you might want to examine your bore-
dom more closely. The truth is, boredom arises because you’re not paying
close enough attention or you have some judgment or preference that keeps
you from showing up wholeheartedly for the present moment. In fact, most of
us have become accustomed to constant stimulation and have difficulty sit-
ting still when we’re focusing on something simple like . . . well, like following
our breath.
Boredom, like restlessness, can prevent you from experiencing the subtler
beauties of life — and meditation can provide a wonderful opportunity to
explore your boredom. Begin by naming it: “boredom, boredom.” How do 
you experience it in your body? What stories does the mind spin? Instead 
of reacting to your boredom, just let yourself be mindfully bored. You may
become so fascinated by your own boredom that you’re no longer bored!

Chapter 12: Troubleshooting the Roadblocks and Side Effects

Fear
Sometimes you sit down to meditate and notice that your mind is filled with
fearful thoughts and feelings that weren’t apparent before. Where did they
come from? You may have been anxious or afraid about something but didn’t
realize it until you began to meditate. Or your mindful attention may have
flushed old fears to the surface to be explored and released. Perhaps you’re
afraid of your meditation itself — afraid that you won’t be able to do it right
or deal with your stress or afraid of what challenging memories or feelings
might come up while you meditate.
If so, you’re not alone! Fear is one of the most pervasive and basic of human
emotions — no wonder it rears its head in meditation. You can use your prac-
tice as an excellent opportunity to work with your fear by following the
instructions offered in Chapter 11.
202
Part III: Troubleshooting and Fine-Tuning 
When fear is no longer an obstacle
In her book When Things Fall Apart, the
American-born Buddhist teacher Pema Chodron
tells the story of a young Westerner who went to
India in the 1960s. He desperately wanted to
overcome his negative emotions, especially fear,
which he believed to be an obstacle to his
progress.
The teacher he met there kept telling him to stop
struggling, but the young man took this instruc-
tion as just another technique for getting rid of
his fear.
Finally, his teacher sent him to a hut in the
foothills to meditate. Late one night, while he
was sitting, he heard a noise and turned to see
a huge snake with hood lifted, swaying in the
corner. The young man was terrified. He sat
facing the snake, unable to move or fall asleep.
He couldn’t use any meditation techniques to
avoid his feelings — he could only sit with his
breath and his fear and the snake in the corner.
Toward morning, as the last candle flickered
out, the young man experienced a flood of ten-
derness and compassion for all the animals and
people in the world. He could feel their suffer-
ing and their longing, and he could see that he
had been using his meditation to separate, not
only from others but also from himself.
In the darkness, he began to cry. Yes, he was
angry and proud and frightened — but he was
also unique and wise and immeasurably pre-
cious. With deep gratitude, he got up, walked
toward the snake, and bowed. Then he fell
asleep on the floor. When he woke up, the
snake had disappeared — and so had his des-
perate need to struggle with his fear.

Doubt
This roadblock can be an especially challenging one because it calls the
whole journey into question. “Do I have what it takes to meditate? My mind
never settles down — maybe I should try yoga or t’ai chi. What’s the point 
of following my breath? How can this practice possibly bring relaxation and
peace of mind?” Of course, asking questions and getting satisfactory answers
is important — but when you’ve decided to give meditation a try, you need 
to treat your doubts as grist for your mill, instead of constantly taking them
seriously.
Doubt can also result from pushing yourself too hard and holding high expec-
tations; in meditation you need to set your expectations aside (as I mention
in Chapter 6) and just do it, with the faith that the benefits will naturally
accrue over time. To develop such faith, you may want to read other books
like this one that extol the virtues of meditation.
Doubt stirs up your mind and makes concentration difficult. Begin by naming
your doubt and noticing the sensations it evokes and the stories it spins.
With mindful awareness, doubt gradually settles down and recedes to the
background. Eventually, all your little doubts may even coalesce into a great
doubt that motivates you to inquire deeply into the nature of existence and
come up with some answers for yourself.
Procrastination
Like doubt, procrastination can bring your meditation to a screeching halt.
After all, if you keep putting it off, you won’t be able to reap the benefits. If you
tend to procrastinate in other areas of your life, you now have an opportunity
to look beyond your usual excuses to the deeper feelings and concerns that
fuel this pattern. Take some time to ask yourself honestly — but also gently
and without judgment — what gets in the way of your following through on
your intentions.
As described in the previous sections, you may be afraid or bored or have
doubts about the value of meditation. Perhaps a self-sabotaging part of you
doesn’t want you to make the positive changes that meditation offers, and so
it keeps undermining your efforts. Or you may be too restless and distracted
to find the time for the very activity that could help you deal with your rest-
lessness and distractibility. When you get your meditation back on track, you
can explore these patterns further. (You may also want to refresh your moti-
vation or develop self-discipline — in which case, turn to Chapter 4 or
Chapter 9.)
203
Chapter 12: Troubleshooting the Roadblocks and Side Effects

Hypervigilance
The next time you see a loving new mother, notice how she attends to her
baby. Does she constantly monitor his face for signs of illness or discomfort?
No, if she has a healthy relationship with her child, she gently gazes into his
eyes with warm and caring attention, but without anxiety or concern.
You might find it helpful to bring the same gentle, mindful attention to your
meditation. If you tend to get obsessive or perfectionistic or laserlike in your
focus, you may just end up getting more stressed out than when you began.
Instead, relax your attention like a loving mother, noticing your experience
without becoming concerned or tense. You may also want to inquire into the
deeper fear that may be motivating your hypervigilance.
Hypervigilance may also take the form of constantly monitoring your progress,
constantly asking “How am I doing now?” The problem is, true progress in med-
itation involves simply being present without extra concerns like wondering
how you’re doing. Again, you can relax your awareness and just let yourself do
what you do.
Self-judgment
Like fear, self-judgment is a nearly universal human experience, at least in the
West. You may focus your judgment on your meditation — you’re not doing it
right, you don’t know how to concentrate — or on your being as a whole —
you’re inadequate, unlovable, not quite good enough. The judging mind may
even disguise itself as an objective observer or a spiritual coach, constantly
comparing your progress to some internalized ideal. “If you were like the
Buddha, you would be totally calm and undisturbed,” it might say. Or, “If you
were a good Christian (or Moslem or Jew), you would experience no anger or
fear.” Unfortunately, as one of my teachers used to say, “comparison kills” —
meaning that it tends to dampen the unique vitality and expression that
belong to you alone and can’t be compared with anything else.
By naming or noticing your self-judgments, you can gain some distance from
them, rather than take their word as gospel, as so many of us do. What does
your voice of judgment sound like? What stories does it foist upon you as
truth? Does it remind you of someone — say, a parent or boss? Are you trying
to push away parts of your experience because they’re undesirable in some
way? Notice how judgment feels in your body. When you get caught up in
judgment, you may find yourself tightening and tensing in response.
As you become familiar with your judgments, you can begin to welcome them
as old friends, not only in meditation but in everyday life as well — without
buying their story.
204
Part III: Troubleshooting and Fine-Tuning 

Attachment and desire
Just as fear and judgment attempt to avoid or resist certain experiences,
attachment holds on tight to what you have — while desire keeps trying to
find something better. When you’re attached — to your career or your rela-
tionship or your material possessions — you may resist letting go when cir-
cumstances change. Who wouldn’t? But attachment can be a setup for pain,
because life has this curious tendency to do what it pleases, despite your
preferences to the contrary. With desire, the dissatisfaction of not having
what you want and having what you don’t want runs like a painful undercur-
rent just beneath the surface of conscious awareness.
I’m not recommending complete nonattachment and desirelessness here —
after all, only the Buddha could pull that one off! Nor am I equating desire
with pleasure — in fact, the experience of desire can be extremely unpleas-
ant, like a tormenting itch that never goes away, no matter how much you
scratch; true pleasure, by contrast, fulfills a deep and natural human need.
But I am suggesting that you can discover how to create some space around
your desires and attachments so that you’re not overwhelmed by the unpre-
dictable ups and downs of life. (For more on attachment, see Chapter 5.)
Attachment and desire can show up in your meditation in a number of forms.
Perhaps you covet the moments of relative calm and become upset when
your mind gets agitated or preoccupied. Or you may have a particular fond-
ness for certain thoughts — fantasies of financial success, for example, or
images of last month’s vacation — and find that you’re reluctant to let go of
them and return to your breath or your mantra. Maybe you’re constantly
lusting and longing for some imagined fulfillment that’s just out of reach.
As with the other roadblocks, you can explore your attachment and desire,
first by gently naming them as they arise and then by noticing the thoughts
and sensations that comprise them.
Pride
Here’s a classic meditation scenario. You’ve been sitting regularly for a few
weeks, and one day your mind calms down like the surface of a still forest
pool. The next thing you know you’re having the following thoughts: “Wow,
I’m hardly thinking at all, and I’ve counted my breaths from one to ten now
for at least five minutes. Cool! I’m really getting the hang of this meditation
stuff. Pretty soon I’ll be an expert. Maybe I’ll even become enlightened. . . .”
Not only have you been bitten by the bug of pride, which latches on to your
accomplishments and uses them to bolster your sagging self-image, but
205
Chapter 12: Troubleshooting the Roadblocks and Side Effects

you’ve also gotten sidetracked in your meditation. Pride can also take the
form of bragging to your family and friends about how often you meditate or
merely feeling special and superior to others.
As I explain in the section “Attachment and desire,” you might want to inves-
tigate the thoughts and feelings that make up your pride. Underneath it, you
may find some fear or insecurity or a desire to be loved and appreciated. Or
you can remind yourself that meditation has nothing to do with achievement
and everything to do with being present in the moment for whatever is aris-
ing. As soon as you get puffed up about how well you’re meditating, you’re
gone — so gently bring yourself back to your breath.
Hiding out
If you’re trying to avoid confronting certain problems or challenges in your
life, you may turn to meditation as a convenient escape and end up logging
hours on your cushion that might be better spent paying your bills or prepar-
ing for a career change or sharing your feelings with your partner. The New
Yorker magazine ran a cartoon a few years back that speaks to this issue: A
Zen monk sits peacefully on his cushion, while behind a screen in the back-
ground lies a huge, chaotic pile of stuff.
Meditation can help you calm your mind, open your heart, and face the fears
and other feelings that may stand in your way — but ultimately you need to
take down the screen and apply what you’ve learned to the real world. (In
other words, meditation, like work, sex, and watching TV, can become addic-
tive if you abuse it.) Now, you’re not becoming addicted if you spend a half
hour or an hour each day meditating — or even head off for a retreat every
now and then. But if you find yourself hiding out from the challenges of life,
pay attention — the themes that keep recurring in your meditation may not
be distractions at all, but pressing concerns that require your response.
Bypassing
Just as you can hide out from life’s problems, you can also use meditation as 
a convenient way to avoid facing deeper psychological and emotional issues.
Particularly if you develop strong concentration, you can focus on your breath
or some other object of meditation while actively suppressing unpleasant or
“unspiritual” feelings. I know people who, after many years of meditation in
monasteries or ashrams, finally discover that they’re literally sitting on a life-
time of unresolved grief, resentment, or pain. If you follow the guidelines pro-
vided in Chapter 11 for working with your emotions, you might not have to
contend with this particular roadblock.
206
Part III: Troubleshooting and Fine-Tuning 

How to Enjoy the Side Effects — 
without Getting Sidetracked
In addition to the roadblocks, you may also encounter a number of unusual
and compelling experiences on your journey — what I like to call the side
effects or roadside attractions. Earlier in this chapter and in Chapter 11, I
describe ordinary emotions, patterns, and mind-states that may prove chal-
lenging as your meditation deepens. Here I’m talking about what conscious-
ness researchers call altered states — nonordinary experiences of body, mind,
and heart that, though essentially harmless, may be startling, confusing, or
frightening for the neophyte meditator.
Some people meditate for years and never experience anything out of the 
ordinary. As a Zen monk, for example, I kept hoping for some dramatic break-
through but got only the occasional insight to punctuate thousands of hours of
meditation. Others sit down and within a few sessions begin to have glimpses
of what researchers call the transpersonal dimension of experience. A friend of
mind has always seen angels and other transcendent beings, both on and off
her meditation cushion.
Meditation traditions differ too in how they regard such extraordinary experi-
ences. Some teach that the point is simply to be here now — and anything
else that occurs is merely a potential distraction. Another New Yorker cartoon
puts it succinctly: A grizzled old monk sitting in meditation turns to his young
companion and says, apparently in response to a question, “Nothing happens
next. This is it.” If a moment of true awakening occurs, according to these tra-
ditions, it merely takes the form of a shift in perspective, without fireworks or
flashy signs. By contrast, other traditions view extraordinary experiences as
meaningful or possibly even necessary landmarks on the path to freedom and
awakening. (For more on spiritual experiences, see Chapter 14.)
In mindfulness meditation, the method I describe in this book (see Chap-
ter 6), you simply approach the extraordinary in the same way you greet the
ordinary — with gentle, mindful attention. The point is to welcome whatever
arises — and in the process to awaken to who you already are — so any expe-
riences you encounter along the way are just roadside attractions. Enjoy
them and keep going. If they become distracting or painful, you may want to
seek a qualified teacher.
To help you deal with these experiences without getting sidetracked or over-
whelmed, Buddhist teacher Jack Kornfield, in his book A Path with Heart, sug-
gests that you keep in mind the following three guidelines:
 Side effects are just that. Don’t get attached to them or take them as an
indication of either spiritual accomplishment or spiritual failure. Just
keep going.
207
Chapter 12: Troubleshooting the Roadblocks and Side Effects

 Apply the brakes if you must. If the side effects get too intense, stop
meditating for a while and engage in more “grounding” activities that
connect you with your body and the earth, like working in the garden,
getting a massage, or walking in nature. (To help you ground, try the
meditation in the sidebar “What to do when you’re feeling ungrounded”
later in this chapter.)
 Appreciate altered states as part of the larger dance of meditation.
Don’t get caught resisting or struggling with them. Just try to welcome
them as you do every experience.
The following subsections highlight a few of the extraordinary experiences
you may encounter in your meditation, divided for your convenience into
four separate categories. (For more-detailed descriptions of these experi-
ences, I highly recommend A Path with Heart.)
Rapture and bliss
When your concentration deepens (but sometimes before), you may begin to
have nonordinary physical experiences known as rapture. Perhaps the most
common form of rapture involves the pleasurable movement of subtle (or
not-so-subtle) energy through the body. As it moves, this energy encounters
areas of tightness and contraction that open and release in response. The
energetic releases can take the form of vibrations, trembling, or sudden or
repetitive spontaneous movements known in the yoga tradition as kriyas. For
example, you might feel spasms going up your spine or involuntary move-
ments of your arms or head.
Although the energy of rapture is generally experienced as pleasurable, you
might be understandably surprised and a bit disturbed to find your body
moving in ways you can’t seem to control. Jack Kornfield, for example, reports
that his arms began to flap like a bird’s while he was meditating intensively in a
monastery in Thailand. He followed his teacher’s advice to observe the move-
ments without trying to stop or control them, and they gradually subsided on
their own.
Just remember that you’re not going insane or doing something wrong if you
experience rapture; in fact, rapture generally signifies a deepening of concen-
tration. As much as possible, keep meditating as you bring mindful awareness
to your experience and allow the energy to do its healing work of releasing
your stuck places. If the energy gets too intense, just stop meditating and do
something ordinary and physical, as Kornfield recommends.
208
Part III: Troubleshooting and Fine-Tuning 

Rapture refers to more than just energy; it comes in other forms and flavors
too. For example, you may have chills or hot flashes for no apparent reason.
Or you may experience your body as extraordinarily heavy and dense or as
transparent and filled with light. Or you may have prickling or tingling sensa-
tions followed by waves of pleasure and delight. Rapture can take as many
forms as the people who experience it.
As for bliss, it’s the powerful rapture that accompanies a spiritual insight or
unitive experience. Mystics from the Judeo-Christian tradition, for instance,
often report experiencing bliss when they achieve the pinnacle of their jour-
ney: oneness with God.
Visions and other sensory experiences
If you don’t experience rapture, don’t be disappointed — you may get your
altered states in the visual channel. My friend who sees angels also has
visions of traveling to other realms in her meditation where she meets
enlightened beings that teach and empower her. These experiences don’t 
disturb her; quite the contrary, she enjoys and even invites them.
Though you may not have such elaborate visions, you still may see colored
lights or images of what appear to be past lives or vivid memories or glimpses
of other realities. Again, you needn’t be disturbed — just take them as evi-
dence of deepening concentration and don’t get distracted from the focus of
your meditation. (Of course, if you find them meaningful, by all means appreci-
ate what they have to offer. But the point of meditation as I teach it in this
book is to awaken to the present moment, not to spend your meditation time
exploring the endless world of altered states.)
In addition to visual phenomena, you may also have auditory or olfactory
experiences, including inner voices; music; powerful, resonant sounds; or
unusual smells. Or you may find that your meditation heightens your percep-
tual sensitivity so that you see, hear, smell, feel, or taste things more acutely.
(Depending on your particular tastes and what you happen to be sensing,
you may find this increased sensitivity pleasant or unpleasant.)
Emotional rollercoaster
As your mind settles down and you welcome your experience, you create
inner space for unfelt (and possibly unconscious) emotions to bubble up and
release. (For more on the process of spontaneous release, see Chapter 11.)
209
Chapter 12: Troubleshooting the Roadblocks and Side Effects

One of my early Zen friends spent her first few years of meditation crying qui-
etly on her cushion. Often, she reported that her feelings didn’t have much
content or story line — they just occurred as waves of energy in her body.
Other people I know meditate regularly for years with little emotion, then
suddenly, like an airplane, they hit a patch of turbulence and experience days
or even weeks of anger or grief.
210
Part III: Troubleshooting and Fine-Tuning 
What to do when you’re feeling ungrounded
Sometimes people who meditate find that their
upper chakras (that is, the energy centers from
the heart to the crown) open more quickly than
their lower chakras, bringing a rush of energy
and insight to their head and shoulders while
the lower half of their body remains relatively
stagnant or numb. In particular, those who get
sidetracked by some of the flashy side effects
of meditation may start to feel ungrounded and
lose touch with their basic needs for food,
sleep, and physical exercise.
Here’s a simple exercise that can help you
ground down into the earth when you start feel-
ing like you’re going to lift out of your body into
some more ethereal realm:
1. Begin by sitting quietly, closing your eyes,
and taking a few slow, deep breaths.
If possible, sit on the ground, with your back
relatively straight (see Chapter 7 for more
on sitting positions).
2. Focus your awareness on your lower
abdomen, at a point about 2 inches below
your navel and 11⁄2 inches inside your body.
Martial artists call this area the t’an t’ien
and believe it’s a focal point for life energy,
or chi. Explore this area with mindful atten-
tion, noticing how it feels. 
3. Direct your breath into this area, expand-
ing it when you inhale and contracting it
when you exhale.
Consciously and deliberately breathe into
your t’an t’ien for five minutes or more,
allowing your awareness and your energy
to concentrate there. Notice how your
center of gravity shifts from the upper part
of your body to your t’an t’ien.
4. Continuing to breathe with your t’an t’ien,
imagine that you’re a tree with roots that go
deep into the earth.
Both feel and visualize these roots originat-
ing in the t’an t’ien and growing down
through the base of your spine into the
ground, spreading through the soil as far
down as you can imagine.
5. Feel and visualize these roots drawing
energy up from the earth into your t’an t’ien
on the inhalation, and feel the energy
spreading down through the roots on the
exhalation.
Continue to feel and visualize this circula-
tion of energy — up on the inhale, down on
the exhale — for five or ten minutes.
6. When your t’an t’ien feels charged and
strong, you can get up and go about your
day.
Every now and then, you can stop for a
moment or two and imagine your roots once
again.

If you find the emotions difficult to handle, you can consult the guidelines I
provide in Chapter 11 — or you may want to seek the advice of a qualified
meditation teacher. (For information on the meditation guidance I offer by
phone, check out my Web site at www.stephanbodian.org. For advice on
finding a teacher, see Chapter 13.) Otherwise, you can continue to sit with
mindful awareness as you allow the emotions to ripple through your body,
mind, and heart. Sometimes these feelings — which, incidentally, can include
ecstasy and joy as well as sadness and pain — come from deep unconscious
layers that hark back to early childhood or infancy. At other times, the feel-
ings may seem like they have nothing to do with you at all. Whatever your
experience, you can practice welcoming it with mindful awareness without
trying to change it or push it away.
Energetic openings
When you meditate regularly for weeks or months, you generate energy that
begins to accumulate in your body. Eventually, this energy may take the rela-
tively subtle form of rapture (as described in the previous section) — or it
may express itself as kundalini, the powerful life force that (according to the
Indian tantric tradition) animates all things and lies coiled at the base of the
spine like a serpent. (For more on Indian tantra, see Chapter 3.)
Meditation can awaken kundalini and send it up the central energetic channel
(which is aligned with but distinct from the spine) — and so can certain
other activities and events like childbirth, sex, prayer, powerful emotions,
and physical trauma. As the kundalini rises — which may occur slowly and
gradually or suddenly and unexpectedly — it encounters the seven major
energy centers (also known as chakras) that lie situated along the central
channel from the base of the spine to the crown of the head. (For a detailed
map of the chakras, see Figure 12-1. Note: The chakras are shown in order
from the bottom up, with the first chakra located at the base of the spine and
the seventh at the top of the head.)
Described by those who can see them as spinning wheels or vortexes of
energy, the chakras transform energy from one frequency to another (for exam-
ple, from spiritual to emotional) and act as intermediaries between an individ-
ual’s inner life and the external world. Apparently, they work best when they’re
open and relatively balanced. When they’re closed or imbalanced — a common
occurrence — you may experience certain problems, ailments, or issues that
correspond with particular chakras.
211
Chapter 12: Troubleshooting the Roadblocks and Side Effects

In particular, people who meditate frequently may have a tendency to open
their upper chakras (from the heart to the crown) relatively easily, while
keeping their lower chakras relatively closed. For example, many people find
it easier to have spiritual experiences or feel unconditional love for all beings
than to deal with core personal issues like trust, safety, intimacy, and self-
assertion. As a result, these lower centers may require special attention and
tender, gentle investigation before they open.
Certain meditation techniques aim to awaken the kundalini and guide it
through the chakras until it reaches the crown of the head, where it ulti-
mately bursts forth in a moment of powerful illumination. Others work on
opening and energizing particular chakras. (For example, see Chapter 10 for
meditations that open the heart.) The primary technique I propose in this
book, known as mindfulness meditation, doesn’t focus on the chakras at all.
But people who practice mindfulness may experience the opening of particu-
lar energy centers as a side effect of their meditative journey.
To help you recognize these openings if and when they do occur, I’ll describe
each of the chakras in some detail. (Incidentally, Indian tantra, which has
branches in both Hinduism and Buddhism, is not the only tradition to talk
about chakras. Jewish kabbalists, Sufi dervishes, and Taoist sages all have
their own unique energy systems and centers.) In addition to the experiences
described in the bullets that follow, you may feel tightness or constriction in

the area when a chakra is relatively closed and a noticeable increase of
energy when it opens.
 First chakra: Located at the base of the spine and connected with issues
of survival and safety. When it’s relatively closed, you may feel insecure
and ungrounded, possibly even terrified and mistrustful of your capacity
to survive. As it opens, you may feel energy flowing down through your
body into the earth, accompanied by images and feelings associated
with safety and survival as well as an overall sense of stability and trust.
Positive expression: “I’m safe and at home in the world and in my body.”
 Second chakra: Located in the lower abdomen about 2 inches below the
navel; connected with issues of sexuality, creativity, and emotional attach-
ment. When it’s relatively closed, you may feel ashamed of your body, sex-
ually inhibited, and emotionally disconnected from others. As it opens,
you may experience a rush of sexual feelings or imagery, including possi-
ble images of past abuse or dysfunction, as well as a sense of potency,
playfulness, and flow with others. Positive expression: “I’m a creative,
sexual, emotional being.”
 Third chakra: Located at the solar plexus just below the diaphragm and
connected with issues of interpersonal power and authenticity. When
this chakra is relatively closed, you may find it difficult to trust (either
yourself or others), to set interpersonal boundaries, or to express or
even acknowledge your own anger or vulnerability. As it opens, you may
experience a release of anger or shame and a deepening and expansion
of your breath, accompanied by feelings of personal power and vitality.
Positive expression: “I trust myself and others.”
 Fourth chakra (often called the “heart chakra”): Located in the center
of the chest near the heart and connected with issues of love and self-
esteem. When this chakra is closed, you may feel self-hatred, resent-
ment, and alienation from others, and you may find it difficult to give
and receive love freely. As it opens, you may experience a release of old
grief or pain, accompanied by love or joy or poignancy and a sense of
boundless expansiveness. (For more on opening the heart chakra, see
Chapter 10.) Positive expression: “I’m loving and worthy of being loved.”
 Fifth chakra (also known as the “throat chakra”): Located in the center
of the throat; connected with issues of honest, direct, and responsible
self-expression. When it’s relatively closed, you may find it difficult to
share your feelings, thoughts, or concerns without diluting or distorting
them to make them more acceptable to others. As this chakra opens,
you may experience a sudden upsurge of things you’ve always wanted 
to say, accompanied by increased confidence in your own voice and cre-
ativity. Positive expression: “I have a right to express my truth.”
 Sixth chakra (sometimes called the “third eye”): Located between and
slightly above the eyebrows; connected with intellectual clarity, intuition,
and personal vision. When this chakra is relatively closed, you may have
213
Chapter 12: Troubleshooting the Roadblocks and Side Effects

difficulty thinking clearly or planning for the future, and you may have
strong personal opinions, prejudices, or negative beliefs about yourself.
As this chakra opens, you may have sudden insights or intuitions that
expand your intellectual or spiritual horizons, possibly accompanied by
inner visions or even psychic abilities. Positive expression: “I see things
clearly.”
 Seventh chakra (also known as the “crown chakra”): Located at the
very top of the head; connected with issues of freedom and spiritual
transcendence. When this chakra is relatively closed (as it is in most
people), you may feel cut off from the sacred or spiritual dimension of
life. As it opens, you may feel a subtle pressure or pain at first, followed
by a release of energy through the crown of the head and an influx of
what people have described as grace, peace, blessing, or illumination. 
At the same time, you may feel your identity dissolving and merging 
with the vast expanse of being itself. Needless to say, the opening of this
chakra is a precious event much sought after in certain spiritual tradi-
tions. Positive expression: “I am.”

Checking out your chakras
Because the energy centers, or chakras, figure
so prominently in certain meditative traditions
and may naturally open in response to regular
meditation, you may want to take a brief tour
through your own chakras, just to get a lay of
the land. Begin by sitting quietly, relaxing your
body, and taking a few deep breaths.
 First chakra: Bring your awareness to your
perineum, which is the point halfway
between your anus and your genitals. (If
you don’t know what I’m talking about, just
focus on the area deep down in your pelvis,
at the very base of your abdomen.) As you
rest your awareness there, imagine gently
caressing the area with your breath. How
does the area feel to you? Do you notice any
tightness, vibration, or agitation? Does it
feel like this energy center is open and
energized or closed and constricted? Take
your time, and don’t try to figure it out —
just be aware of the sensations.
 Second chakra: Bring your awareness to a
point about 2 inches below your bellybutton
and 1 or 2 inches inside your abdomen. As
described in the previous bullet, breathe
into the area and check out how it feels.
 Third chakra: Bring your awareness to your
solar plexus, the area in your upper
abdomen right beneath your sternum, or
breastbone. As described earlier, breathe
and feel.
 Fourth chakra: Bring your awareness to the
center of your chest inside, near your heart.
Again, breathe and feel.
 Fifth chakra: Bring your awareness to the
center of your throat, near your Adam’s
apple. Breathe and feel.
 Sixth chakra: Bring your awareness to your
“third eye,” the point on your forehead
between and just above your eyebrows.
Breathe and feel.

215
Chapter 12: Troubleshooting the Roadblocks and Side Effects
 Seventh chakra: Bring your awareness to
the crown of your head. Breathe and feel.
As you locate each chakra in turn and settle
your awareness there, you can do the following
exercise. (Alternatively, you might just choose
to focus on one or two chakras that seem to be
calling out for your attention because they feel
tight or uncomfortable or especially energized.) 
Here’s the exercise:
1. Begin by sitting quietly, closing your eyes,
and taking a few slow, deep breaths, relax-
ing a little with each exhalation.
2. As you rest your awareness gently on the
chakra, set aside all thoughts and allow an
image (or images) to arise.
The image may take the form of a memory,
an object, or a geometric shape or color.
Take whatever comes and sit with it for a
few moments.
3. Ask yourself: “If this chakra had a voice,
what would it say?”
Allow it to speak its mind to you fully, and
take the time to listen.
4. Finally, you may want to ask yourself: 
“If this chakra were an animal, what would
it be?”
Allow an image or felt sense of an animal to
appear and unfold in your awareness.
If you don’t get a response to every one of these
questions, don’t worry. Many people are
stronger in one channel (for example, auditory)
than in another (for example, visual). With con-
tinued practice, you’ll gradually tune in to your
chakras and what they have to share with you.
Each time you do the exercise, you’ll get differ-
ent information, depending on the current state
of your energy centers.
Preparing for sleep
Most of us go to bed at night filled with the wor-
ries, concerns, and excitements we’ve accu-
mulated during the day. Instead, try preparing
for sleep using one of the following exercises:
 As you undress, imagine removing all your
cares and responsibilities, one by one.
Imagine feeling yourself growing lighter,
more relaxed, and more spacious, until your
mind is completely empty and filled with a
pleasant, rosy glow. Imagine this glow
descending to your heart, and rest your
awareness in the center of your heart as
you drift off to sleep.
 Before going to sleep, review your day in
some detail. Take some time to appreciate
your positive accomplishments and experi-
ences. When you come to something you
regret, consider the lesson you learned.
Feel gratitude in your heart to all the people
who contributed to your life today in various
ways, as you drift off to sleep.
 Lie on your back and feel the contact of
your body against the bed. Beginning with
your feet and working slowly up through
your legs, hips, torso, arms, neck, and head,
gradually relax your body from bottom to
top. When you’re done, feel your body as
one luminous sphere of relaxation as you
drift off to sleep.

Developing a Practice 
That Works for You
In This Chapter
 Finding techniques that match your motivation
 Rounding out your practice with meditations for mind, heart, and body
 Discovering the benefits of regular meditation
 Fitting the pieces together into a practice that works for you
 Meditating with others in groups, workshops, and retreats
A
s you may have noticed if you’ve flipped through some of the other
chapters, I’ve filled this book with meditation techniques drawn from a
variety of different spiritual and secular sources. Maybe I’m just enthusiastic,
but I wanted to make sure I covered all the bases and offered meditations
that would appeal to just about everyone.
Needless to say, you can’t practice all these techniques — nor would you
want to. So I’m going to show you how to choose the ones that are appropri-
ate for your purposes so you can cobble together a meditation practice that’s
well suited for your particular needs. You can also pick up a few tips on how
to find other people to meditate with — and how to design your own little
monastic retreat for a day.
Fitting the Puzzle Pieces Together
In centuries past, ordinary folks didn’t have the opportunity to thumb
through a copy of Meditation For Dummies, pick and choose their favorite
meditation techniques, and then sample them like connoisseurs at a wine
tasting. Instead, they considered themselves extremely fortunate if they hap-
pened upon a teacher willing to impart some secret method. Then they took
it home and practiced it single-mindedly for the rest of their lives.

But times have changed, and you and I live in a veritable meditation super-
store, with a different technique down every aisle. So what’s a poor guy or
gal to do? Well, you need to know yourself, what you like or don’t like, and
what you’re hoping to get out of your meditation. Next, you need to take a sip
here and there, trust your taste buds, and eventually settle on a particular
approach. Then you can use this approach as the centerpiece around which
you construct a regular practice — just as, say, a wonderful meal can be con-
structed around an especially fine wine. But so much for epicurean metaphors!
Here are the principal pieces of a complete meditation practice as they’re
presented in this book. As you can see, I’ve included both meditations them-
selves and related practices:
 Mindfulness meditation (Chapter 6)
 Mantra meditation (Chapters 3 and 14)
 Body scan and relaxation (Chapter 6)
 Walking meditation (Chapter 15)
 Lovingkindness meditation (Chapter 10)
 Compassion meditation (Chapter 10)
 Working with your emotions and habitual patterns (Chapter 11)
 Devotional meditation (Chapter 14)
 Insight practices like self-inquiry (Chapter 14)
 Healing meditation (Chapter 16)
 Mindfulness in action (Chapter 15)
 Using a meditation altar (Chapter 8)
 Chanting and/or bowing (Chapter 14)
 Dedicating your practice (Chapter 14)
How do you know which practices to include in your own custom-tailored
routine? To begin with, you’re better off starting out simple: Choose one tech-
nique and stick with it for a few months — or even years. Then, when you feel
confident in your ability to concentrate reasonably well, you may want to
consider how traditional meditators combine different practices.
In the Buddhist tradition, for example, they generally mix meditations designed
to cultivate wisdom with those that have the power to elicit compassion or
love. Then they season the basic ingredients as needed with others like self-
inquiry or healing meditations. Next, they throw in some walking meditation
(to act as a bridge between sitting meditation and everyday life). Finally, they
218
Part III: Troubleshooting and Fine-Tuning 

frame the whole routine by first reminding themselves why they’re meditating
and then, when they’re done, by dedicating the virtue or power of the medita-
tion to the benefit of others. (Of course, this mixture of ingredients is no casual
hodge-podge but has evolved over several thousand years.)
Maybe you’re not as methodical as all that and would rather just use your
intuition and do what feels right. If so, then go for it! Ultimately, the process
of choosing a set of meditation techniques may be as personal and mysteri-
ous as the process of choosing a mate. But before you make your choices,
here are a few pointers for checking your motivation, balancing your prac-
tice, and trusting your intuition.
Different pieces for different folks
Just as you wouldn’t take a hacksaw to a stick of butter or use your tooth-
brush to scrub your floor, you don’t need to meditate three hours a day if
you’re just looking for a little stress-reduction, and you wouldn’t want to limit
yourself to ten minutes if you’re determined to get enlightened by the end of
next week. In Chapter 4, I describe five principal motivations for meditation:
 Improving your life
 Understanding and accepting yourself
 Realizing your true nature
 Awakening others
 Expressing your innate perfection
Knowing which of these best describes you can help you determine both how
and how much you meditate. (Needless to say, most people fall into the first
three categories; the other two are generally reserved for seasoned medita-
tors.) Mindfulness meditation (presented on the CD and explained in detail in
Chapter 6) makes a great foundational practice, no matter what your motiva-
tion, and it can be extended to every moment of your life (see Chapter 15).
But the rest is up to you.
For example, if you want to help heal a chronic ailment, you can add one or
more of the healing meditations from Chapter 16. If you want to get to know
yourself better or deal with difficult emotions or behaviors, you might want
to pursue some of the techniques offered in Chapter 11. And if you’re headed
straight for the top of the meditation mountain (as described in Chapter 1),
you can experiment with meditations from Chapter 14 for getting closer to
God or gaining direct insight into your essential being.
219
Chapter 13: Developing a Practice That Works for You

Just remember that this book is merely an introduction; if you want to go
deeper in any direction, you’re going to need other books and ultimately, 
perhaps, a living teacher. (For a listing of books you may want to read 
after this one, see the appendix. For a teacher, visit my Web site at www.
stephanbodian.org, or read the guidelines for finding one in Chapter 14.)
Play to your strengths or fill in the gaps?
In addition to motivation, you may want to know a little more about your gen-
eral tendencies and personality traits and how they influence your medita-
tion choices. For example, some people tend to be more cerebral and get
attracted to meditation because they seek greater clarity or understanding.
Others identify more with their feelings and may be drawn to meditation out
of a deep desire to feel God’s love or express their devotion or compassion or
work closely with a particular teacher. Still others focus more on their bodies
and turn to meditation for physical healing or energy or power. These three
types — people who are oriented toward their heads, their hearts, and their
bodies — are described in a number of the great meditative traditions and in
the Western scientific tradition as well. Take a few moments to check out
your predominant orientation.
The head types immediately gravitate to the insight practices, the heart types
to the devotion and compassion practices, and the body types to the relax-
ation exercises and healing meditations. But the truth is, you have a heart, 
a mind, and a body, and you need to develop and cultivate all three in your
meditation practice if you’re going to evolve into a complete, well-rounded
human being.
So notice your tendencies, and indulge them as much as you like. After all,
you need to do what feels right — and often what feels right are the practices
that fit your type. But you may also want to consider filling in the gaps by
including meditations or other practices that stretch you in directions you
don’t ordinarily go. For example, do insight practices, but preface them with
some devotional chanting or bowing (or, even better, do them with an atti-
tude of kindness and compassion). Focus on compassion practices or work-
ing with your emotions, but also relax your body or be mindful of your
sensate experience. Ultimately, any of the basic meditations will help develop
the different parts of you — heart, mind, and body — but be aware of your
tendency to favor one over the others, or even to sidestep one entirely.
Also, life has an uncanny tendency to reveal your Achilles heel and show you
precisely what qualities you need to develop, so pay attention. If you keep
drawing “overly emotional” people into your life or your partner’s “intellectu-
alizing” drives you crazy, perhaps you’re being shown the very qualities you
most need to add to your own repertoire.
220
Part III: Troubleshooting and Fine-Tuning 

Experiment, trust your intuition, 
and then settle down
You can’t really tell how a particular meditation will affect you until you prac-
tice it regularly for a period of time. Just reading about it in a book like this
one or listening to it on a CD won’t tell you much, and practicing it once or
twice may give you a taste and show you whether it’s worth pursuing, but
you won’t get the impact the meditation was designed to evoke.
So do begin by shopping around and sampling the meditations that catch
your eye. Notice how you feel when you try them out. Then trust your intu-
itive sense of what’s right and appropriate for you, and commit yourself to
actually doing the practice regularly for a period of time — I’m talking
months or even years here. (For more on discipline, effort, and commitment,
see Chapter 9.) That’s right, I said “commit” — the dreaded C word. Simply
put, you have to do the same meditation again and again if you want to reap
the benefits. I know this advice runs counter to the quick-fix orientation of
our culture, but you won’t find any shortcuts or get-enlightened-quick
schemes in the world of meditation. As the Nike ad puts it, “Just do it” —
preferably with kindness, gentleness, patience, and compassion, but ulti-
mately you have to do it, again and again!
221
Chapter 13: Developing a Practice That Works for You
The downside of being a dilettante
In every area of interest, from baseball to
investing, you can amass a wealth of informa-
tion to impress your family and friends without
getting your hands dirty actually doing what you
know so much about. (For example, you can
memorize the stats for every player in the Major
Leagues without ever learning how to throw a
baseball.) The same holds true for meditation.
As they say in Zen, “Painted cakes won’t satisfy
your hunger” — and reading all the best medi-
tation books in the world won’t reduce your
stress or calm your busy mind one iota. (You’ll
just end up becoming what one Buddhist
teacher called a “spiritual materialist.”) You
need to roll up your sleeves and apply what
you’ve read.
In the same way, you won’t make any progress
by dabbling in different techniques. (“Mmm, it’s
Tuesday; it must be time for mindfulness.”) You
need to choose one (or two) and stick with it.
(Remember the old adage, “Jack of all trades
and master of none”? Well, your goal is to
master the art of meditation, not amass a few
new tricks to add to your collection.) 
When you encounter restlessness or boredom
(or any of the other “obstacles” described in
Chapter 12), don’t immediately conclude you’ve
made a mistake. Instead, use your resistance
and other difficult emotions and mind-states as
grist for the mill of your meditation. (For instruc-
tions on how to do that, see Chapters 11 and 12.)

Create a regular practice
Now that you have a few guidelines for putting the various pieces together,
you can fashion a practice that you can do day after day. Remember to keep
it simple — after all, the point of meditation is to relax your body and ease
your busy mind, not make your life more complicated. Here are the basic
stages for creating a regular practice that works for you:
 Choose a core technique. If you do nothing else, you’ve still created a
viable meditation practice that will serve you quite well. I recommend
mindfulness meditation because it teaches skills you can translate to
every activity and moment of your life, but some people prefer mantra
meditation or concentration on a visual object.
 Round out your practice. As I suggest in the previous section, you may
want to add another practice or two that cultivates different qualities of
mind, body, or heart. But if you have only a snippet of time each day,
stick with your core technique, instead of getting too complex.
 Decide how much and how often. Depending on your motivation and
your reasons for meditating, you’re going to sit longer or shorter periods
more or less frequently. Your interest in meditation may also wax and
wane somewhat with the cycles of your life. For example, you may have
times when you focus more on outward achievement or family life, and
times when you pay more attention to inner unfolding. For guidelines on
scheduling your meditation, see Chapter 8.
 Keep it regular. I can’t say this too often. Whatever else you do (and
whatever the cycles of your life), stand by your core technique as you
would your loved one or your kids — through thick and thin, ups and
downs, feast and famine, and any other clichés you can muster.
 Add practices as needed, but stick with them. For example, if you get
sick, by all means add a healing meditation. If you want to open your
heart some more, add a lovingkindness meditation. But don’t sacrifice
your core technique, and stick with your new one as well.
 Know when to go deeper. If you find yourself hungering for more time 
on your meditation cushion, then by all means pencil it in. The more you
do, the deeper you’ll go — and you’ll know intuitively when you’re ready.
Better to wait until you want to, instead of pushing yourself because you
think you “should.” (For suggestions on doing a meditation retreat, see
the section “Whenever Two or More of You: Meditating with Others.”)
 Seek help when you need it. You can venture only so far into unknown
terrain alone. If you start encountering problems in your meditation or
experiences that confuse or scare you (or you just want to make sure
you’re doing it right), then you may want to look for a teacher. (For an
overview of meditation problems and pitfalls, check out Chapter 12. For
a teacher, visit my Web site at www.stephanbodian.org or check out
the guidelines in Chapter 14.)
222
Part III: Troubleshooting and Fine-Tuning 

Whenever Two or More of You:
Meditating with Others
All the great meditative traditions agree: Meditating with others confers
extraordinary benefits that enhance your individual practice and accelerate
your personal and spiritual unfolding. Buddhists regard the community of
practitioners as one of the three jewels or treasures of practice, along with
the awakened teacher and the truth itself. Jews believe that God really listens
when ten of His faithful convene together in prayer. And Jesus himself put it
quite elegantly: “Whenever two or more of you are gathered in my name,
there is love.”
Besides, researchers like Dean Ornish have found that a sense of belonging 
or connectedness with others not only improves the quality of life but also
increases longevity. In one study, people who answered yes to the questions
“Do you draw strength from your religious faith?” and “Are you a member of
any organization that meets regularly?” were seven times more likely to sur-
vive open-heart surgery than those who answered no. In another study,
women being given the same conventional treatments for metastatic breast
cancer were divided into two groups — one that met together once a week
223
Chapter 13: Developing a Practice That Works for You
Respecting the cycles of practice
I generally don’t like to talk about progress in
meditation. I’d rather remind you that you’ve
always been where you’re headed, which is
right here and now. If anything, meditation
involves stripping away the veils that keep you
from seeing what’s been true all along.
It’s especially important to realize that meditation
doesn’t entail linear development or improve-
ment. Every day is a new day, and every medita-
tion differs from the last. One day your mind may
seem extraordinarily clear and still, like the
proverbial forest pool, leading you to conclude
that you finally have this meditation stuff down
cold. The next day, without warning, your mind
may seem as turbulent as the ocean during a
hurricane. So much for linear improvement!
Instead of a line, I like to use the image of a
spiral that keeps circling around and around but
gradually rises. You may go through times when
challenging life circumstances like career
changes, losses, or separations stir up difficult
emotions and patterns that pervade your medi-
tation. Then you may go through more tranquil
periods when your concentration deepens and
your mind settles down. If you keep meditating
patiently, without becoming overly discouraged
or elated, you’ll find that you gradually expand
to include more and more of who you are — the
ups and downs, the highs and lows, the rough
spots and the smooth. In the process, you
become more joyful and peaceful — but not in
the measurable, linear way you might have
expected.

for mutual support and one that didn’t. After five years, the women who met
had lived twice as long as the ones who didn’t.
On a more practical level, you may simply find encouragement from other
meditators to persist at what may sometimes seem like a tedious pursuit.
And you can discuss your practice and get useful suggestions based on
others’ experiences — they may already have solved the problems or tra-
versed the terrain that you’re just encountering.
You may wonder how you can find others to meditate with. Well, you have
several options: You can seek out a group or class that’s already meeting,
form a group yourself, or attend a weekend workshop or group retreat.
Joining or forming a meditation group
Now that meditation has become a more mainstream pursuit, it’s becoming
easier to find meditation classes at readily accessible venues like local
churches or synagogues, community centers, adult-education programs, and
community colleges. The problem is, you may not be drawn to the technique
they’re teaching, or you may already know how to meditate and simply want
the support of other warm bodies.
You could ask friends who meditate or check local bulletin boards or the clas-
sifieds for ads announcing the formation of leaderless groups. Or you could
take the initiative and form such a group yourself! Participants don’t have to
practice the same technique or hold the same spiritual or religious beliefs —
they just have to be willing to sit quietly in the same room together doing
whatever they do. You could begin with a reading from the world’s spiritual
literature, if everyone seems amenable, and you might end with discussion or
a Quaker-style silence in which people offer whatever the spirit moves them
to share. Or you can just convene, sit quietly, smile at one another, and leave.
The form is up to you.
Attending your first workshop or retreat
If you’re feeling adventurous or simply want more in-depth instruction and
guidance, you can sign up for an extended period of group meditation. Many
of the organizations listed in the appendix of this book have regional centers
that offer individual instruction and workshops, groups, or retreats. Or you
can head for the main monastery, community, or ashram itself and get a taste
of what it’s like to live with a group of people whose primary focus is the
practice of meditation.
224
Part III: Troubleshooting and Fine-Tuning 

Be sure you know in advance what you’ll be doing on your retreat, and be
wary of the tendency among some groups to proselytize for their own partic-
ular faith or ideology — unless, of course, you happen to be interested.
Also, no matter how relaxed the atmosphere or gentle the approach of the
retreat, you may feel a little scared at first because extended periods of silent
meditation don’t provide any of the usual diversions, such as cellphones or
TV, that keep you from facing yourself. So don’t be surprised if you sign up
and then conjure all kinds of great reasons for canceling at the last minute,
from sick kids to business emergencies. My suggestion: Stick with your origi-
nal intention and go anyway. You’ll be glad you did.
Here are a few other reasons you might come up with for putting off your first
workshop or retreat, with some answers:
 “I’m not good enough yet.” Understandably, you may shudder at the
prospect of sitting quietly for three or four or even more hours each day
when you’ve had difficulty mustering the patience for even 15 minutes.
But don’t let your reservations stop you — you’ll be surprised and
pleased by how deep your concentration can go and how long you can
sustain it when you have the support of a teacher and a group of like-
minded people.
 “I have back or knee problems.” If you have serious physical limita-
tions, you may need to take special precautions and even follow a modi-
fied schedule, but don’t be daunted or deterred. Just be sure to let the
retreat leaders know beforehand so they can help you get comfortable.
(If you merely suffer from the usual aches and pains that accompany sit-
ting, you may be pleased to discover that they actually improve or
become less distracting during the course of your retreat — and many
teachers offer instructions for working with pain during retreat.)
 “I don’t have the time.” What do you mean, exactly? Are you suggesting
that every spare moment between now and next Christmas is booked in
advance? Or do you really mean that you’d rather do other things with
your time? Well, no problem. But if you do decide you’d like to attend a
retreat, I can guarantee that the time will materialize like magic. And
who knows? You may find that the insight and peace of mind you bring
back buys you more time than you spent.
Monk for a day: Creating 
your own solitary retreat
If you’ve been meditating regularly for a few weeks or months (or years) and
feel inspired to practice for an extended period of time but would rather do it
on your own (or don’t have easy access to a group), you can design and
225
Chapter 13: Developing a Practice That Works for You

follow your own retreat schedule. You’ll need the time (even a half-day will do
at first), the place (you’re better off leaving the distractions of home, even if
you live alone), and an extra dose of motivation and self-discipline.
Be sure to block out periods for both sitting and walking meditation (so you
can rest your tired knees and back); leave some open, unstructured gaps in
the program for just being or walking in nature or listening to the birds; and
use the schedule as a guideline, rather than as a rigid form that squeezes the
life out of your practice. If you need to adapt it as inspiration or physical limi-
tations dictate, please do. And be sure to maintain the spirit of meditation
and the practice of mindfulness throughout your day, whether you’re medi-
tating, napping, or going to the bathroom. (You might find it helpful to bring
this book and CD along with you for guidance as needed.)
Here’s a suggested schedule for a one-day retreat that a beginner should be
able to manage without strain. Again, feel free to adapt it to your own particu-
lar limitations, needs, and inclinations — and use the bathroom during walk-

Seeing with the eyes of joy
Most of the time we see the world through the
filter of our wants, needs, expectations, and
whatever mood happens to cast its long
shadow across our minds. Here’s an exercise
for setting aside your filters and seeing things
through the eyes of joy:
1. Sit quietly, close your eyes, and take a few
slow, deep breaths, relaxing a little with
each exhalation.
2. Setting aside your thoughts, worries, and
concerns, search your current experience
and find the place inside where you feel
happy or joyful.
Even though you may feel generally sad or
angry or tired or anxious, you can still find
at least some area inside where you expe-
rience happiness or joy — maybe a hidden
place inside your heart or a quiet spot at the
back of your head.
3. Merge with this feeling and let it permeate
your whole being.
If you’re not sure how to do this, you might
notice whether the feeling has a color or a
temperature or a texture (or all three), and
imagine this quality suffusing and com-
pletely filling your body.
4. Now, open your eyes and face your sur-
roundings and the people in your life with
this joyful feeling.
If you find old, habitual patterns of seeing
creeping back in, set them aside and con-
tinue to see things with the light of your 
own joy.
5. Continue this exercise as long as you can.

Meditation 
in Action

In this part . . .
You discover how to extend your meditation into
every area of your life. After all, what’s the point of
sitting calmly for half an hour, then stressing out for the
rest of the day? When you can stay present and mindful
and keep your heart open — even when you’re arguing
with your partner or driving in rush-hour traffic or dealing
with a screaming child or an angry boss — you’ve discov-

T
hroughout this book, I refer repeatedly to spirituality, though I often dis-
guise it in metaphors or abstractions. After all, how else could I express
the inexpressible? In Chapter 1, I talk about climbing the mountain of medita-
tion and briefly describe what you might encounter if you ever get to the top.
Elsewhere, I use words like pure being or true nature or innate perfection. Well,
if these rather puzzling allusions to a spiritual dimension of being piqued your
interest, here’s where you find out how to use meditation to explore spiritual-
ity to your heart’s content.
No, I won’t be giving you detailed instructions on how to get enlightened or
meet God directly — you might have to check out other books and teachers
for that. But I do offer a brief glimpse of what the spiritual path has to offer so
that you know which direction to take on your journey.
If you’ve ever wandered through the spirituality or religion section of your
local bookstore, you know how many books have been written purporting to
show you the right way to go. But you may still be wondering what all this
spirituality stuff means anyway. Or you may want a little guidance in sorting
out one approach from another. Here’s where you find a few answers —
based on my admittedly limited understanding, of course.
Note: The chapter you’re about to read is filled with spiritual terminology
that may prove offensive to the secular reader. If you find yourself squirming
in your seat when you hear words like spirit or grace or higher reality, you
may prefer to skip this chapter altogether. Then again, you could open your-
self to a whole new dimension of experience. Oops, there’s one of those
words again!

What Does Spirituality Mean Anyway?
If you meditate regularly, you’re going to have spiritual experiences — guaran-
teed. By following your breath or reciting a mantra or merely sitting quietly
and listening with full attention to the sound of the wind through the trees,
you’re cutting through your usual preoccupations and attuning yourself to the
present moment. That’s where glimpses of the spiritual dimension of being
generally occur — in the present. (In fact, as the title of the national bestseller
The Power of Now suggests, being present with awareness is an inherently
spiritual activity. See the sidebar “Where the vertical meets the horizontal”
later in this chapter.) To paraphrase an old saying, spiritual experiences are
accidents — but you make yourself accident-prone when you meditate.
Here are a few of the experiences you may encounter:
 An insight into your interconnectedness with other beings and things
 An upsurge of boundless, unconditional love that spreads throughout
your body
 A pleasurable stream of grace or blessings or illumination from above
 A direct perception of the empty, insubstantial, or impermanent nature
of everything
 A current of energy up the spine through the energy centers that leaves
you feeling more expanded or in touch with spirit (for more on the
energy centers, see Chapter 12)
 An experience of subtle inner sounds, colors, or shapes that have spiri-
tual significance
 An experience of your body dissolving into light or expanding its bound-
aries and dissolving into space
 A shift in identity from being the body-mind to being the space or aware-
ness in which the body-mind exists
 A deep and certain knowing (beyond the mind) of a sacred presence
that exists both within and beyond the world of space and time
 Visions of angels or other spiritual beings
 A direct awareness of the presence of the Divine
 The inner experience of being loved by (or even one with) God
How do you know you’ve had a spiritual experience? Or to put it another way,
what makes an experience spiritual? Well, you might get up from your medita-
tion and actually say, “Wow, that was a spiritual experience.” Or the experi-
ence may somehow fit with your spiritual beliefs and provide further proof or
amplification of what you already know. Or perhaps you simply feel inspired
232
Part IV: Meditation in Action 

or expanded or more loving or open to yourself or others as a result. (As I
mention in Chapter 6, the word spiritual comes from the Latin for “breath” 
or “life force.” Related words include spirited, inspiring, and respiration.)
The definitions of spirituality and spiritual experience really depend on the
person you ask. Some people view spirituality as the vital spark that ani-
mates and enlivens their religious involvement. Others take their spirituality
straight, without religious dogma or ritual. But whatever their orientation, all
the definitions point to a glimpse of something deeper or higher or more real
or more meaningful than our ordinary, workaday lives.
In his classic book The Varieties of Religious Experience, written at the turn 
of the 20th century, the American scholar William James notes that spiritual
experiences generally have four characteristics:
 Ineffability: They can’t be adequately expressed in words but must be
experienced directly.
 Insight: They generally involve the discovery of deep, important truths
that can’t be understood by the rational mind.
 Impermanence: They last for a limited period of time but may recur, and
their meaning may continue to reveal itself, even though the experiences
themselves have faded into memory.
 Passivity: You can prepare for spiritual experiences, but once they
occur, you receive them passively, and they unfold in your awareness
with a power of their own.
Where does the “spiritual dimension” exist? Some people experience it inside
themselves, as the heart or center or deepest part of their being, beneath the
body or the personality. Others experience it outside, above, or all around
them, through spiritual beings on other planes of reality (like angels or spirits
or bodhisattvas) or simply as the current or spirit that infuses all life. You
may get your spiritual experiences when you watch a sunset or walk along
the beach, for example, or when you play with your kids or spend solitary
time communing with yourself. Ultimately, it seems, the spiritual dimension
exists both inside and outside of us, in our deepest heart of hearts and in
every being and thing, beyond the ordinary limitations of space and time.
The “perennial philosophy”: Where 
all religions converge
Just so you don’t think this spirituality stuff belongs to one particular tradi-
tion or another, I’d like to point out that certain philosophers have surveyed
the world’s great religions, from Christianity to Zoroastrianism, and discov-
ered that a common spiritual river runs through them all. This river is called
the perennial philosophy, and it consists of three interconnected currents or
233
Chapter 14: Cultivating Spirituality

principles. (I know this discussion is getting a little serious, but bear with
me — I’ll lighten it up as much as I can.)
 A greater reality exists that underlies the ordinary world of things
and lives and minds. Whether they claim that it transcends or infuses
or is essentially identical with the ordinary world, the great traditions
agree that this divine or spiritual reality exists. Some call it God or the
Holy Spirit, the one (or ones) who created the universe and continues to
orchestrate your life from above. Others call it the ground of being, the
impersonal essence that supports and sustains you. Still others call it
emptiness, essential nature, Self, or Tao. Whatever they name it, this spiri-
tual dimension is a sacred mystery that gives meaning, purpose, and
truth to human life.
 In each person there exists something similar to, or even identical
with, this greater reality. Here again, the traditions may disagree on the
form this something may take. Christians call it soul, Jews refer to the
divine spark within, Hindus call it atman, and Buddhists use words like
Buddha nature or big mind. But all agree that this something connects us
with the greater (or higher or deeper) reality that underlies ordinary life.
 The ultimate goal of human life is to realize this greater reality. The
Sufi mystic may seek to unite with it, the Buddhist monk may strive to
awaken to it, the Christian contemplative may yearn to have glimpses of
it — and the rest of us may be quite content to feel connected with it (or
merely pay homage to it at church, temple, or synagogue every now and
then). However you approach it, the great spiritual traditions agree that
every human being harbors a deep longing (however buried or dis-
guised) to realize this greater reality.
As I mention in Chapter 1, you can take many paths up the mountain of being.
But all the paths agree that the mountain exists, that you’re somehow called
to climb it (perhaps just because “it’s there,” as Sir Edmund Hillary said of
Everest), and that what you discover at the top exists (in some form, at least)
inside you all along.
From faith to fruition: The levels 
of spiritual involvement
You can relate to all this spiritual stuff in a variety of ways. You can ignore it
entirely — but I doubt that you would have gotten this far into the chapter if
you had no interest in the subject at all. You can believe in it in one form or
another. (Perhaps you have faith in the existence of angels, adhere to the doc-
trine of a particular religion, or read books about shamans, saints, or sages
and believe in the reality they describe.) Or you can aspire to experience the
spiritual dimension for yourself.
234
Part IV: Meditation in Action 

For convenience, I like to break spiritual involvement down into six levels.
They aren’t mutually exclusive — you can engage in one or two or all of them,
if you like. They’re not hierarchical; in other words, one isn’t necessarily
better or higher or more advanced than another. And they’re certainly not
hard and fast; they’re just my way of making sense of something that’s ulti-
mately unfathomable. Here are the six levels:
 Believing in spirit: I use the word spirit here to refer to the greater real-
ity I talked about earlier that underlies the ordinary world of people and
things. Believing in spirit is an important first step because it opens you
to the possibility of getting closer to it in some way.
 Awakening to spirit: When you have a glimpse of the spiritual dimen-
sion (one of the spiritual experiences listed earlier in this chapter), you
no longer merely believe — now you know. But such experiences may
235
Chapter 14: Cultivating Spirituality
Where the vertical meets the horizontal
Here’s a helpful framework for understanding
the relationship between the ordinary and the
spiritual — and how meditation brings them
together.
Your everyday life occurs on the horizontal
plane of space and time, cause and effect.
(Some traditions call this plane the relative level
of reality.) You’re constantly moving from here
to there, past to future, planning for tomorrow
and evaluating yesterday, doing and achieving
and hurrying — and maybe occasionally stop-
ping to relax or watch TV. The horizontal plane
is where you evolve outwardly: You grow up,
learn life’s lessons, create relationships and
family, pursue your career, achieve some mea-
sure of maturity and wisdom — all extremely
important accomplishments.
At the same time, a vertical plane exists that has
nothing to do with space and time. (In contrast
to the relative, this plane is called the absolute
level.) It’s the timeless or eternal realm that all
the great religious traditions describe — the top
of the mountain that I mention in Chapter 1. They
call it vertical because it intersects and per-
vades the horizontal in every moment. And if you
know how to attune yourself to it, you can allow
it to inform and inspire you, and suffuse your
being with grace, spirit, wisdom, compassion —
the words depend on the nature of your experi-
ence and the tradition you follow (if any).
Meditation brings you out of your time-bound
planning and thinking into the present moment
precisely where the spiritual dimension meets
your ordinary life. You know those bumper stick-
ers that say: Grace happens? Well, it’s more
likely to happen when you’re open to it.
As you sit and coordinate your body, breath, and
mind through the practice of following your
breath or reciting a mantra, you create an inner
harmony or alignment that invites the influx of the
vertical plane. (In fact, the vertical and horizontal
planes are always intersecting — you just don’t
notice.) And when you keep coming back to the
present moment in your ordinary life between
meditations, you’re more likely to see the spirit in
every being and thing you encounter.

fade and become little more than memories, unless they’re sustained or
rekindled through regular spiritual practice.
 Being in touch with spirit: Sometimes the awakening leaves you sub-
stantially transformed. When you look at people and things, you no
longer see them in the same old way. Instead, they’re permeated with
new meaning and depth, and you’re in touch with the spiritual dimen-
sion wherever you go and whatever you do.
 Being infused with spirit: Not only do you sense the presence of spirit in
every being and thing, now you know with certainty that spirit infuses
every fiber of your own being as well — or, in other words, that you and
spirit are essentially the same. You clearly experience spirit as the greater
reality or substance of your life that connects you with everything.
 Being one with spirit: When separation falls away and you merge with
the greater reality, you achieve the state of oneness that mystics and Zen
masters describe. But until you thoroughly integrate this realization into
every aspect of your life, you may still enter and leave the oneness with-
out being fully established or rooted in it.
 No separation between spirit and ordinary life: Now you know without
doubt that ordinary, everyday reality, the sacred spiritual dimension,
and your own essential nature are one and the same. No matter where
you go or what you do, you meet the divine in everyone and everything,
without the slightest trace of separation.
Dissolving or expanding the self: 
The point of spiritual practice
The great spiritual traditions also agree that the primary reason we suffer —
and the primary problem we need to resolve — is the experience of being a
separate, isolated individual, cut off from God or source or our own essential
nature. When you meditate, you’re bridging the apparent chasm that sepa-
rates you and connecting with your breath, with your body and senses, with
your heart, with the present moment, and ultimately with a greater reality.
(It’s this connection that promotes healing, as Dr. Dean Ornish and other
researchers have found. For more on Ornish’s groundbreaking work on
reversing heart disease, see Chapter 2.)
As I mention in the previous section, you can believe in spirit, awaken to it,
stay in touch with it, and become infused by it — all very important and
invaluable stages on the spiritual journey. (In fact, just about everyone I
know, including myself, lies somewhere along this continuum.) But the ulti-
mate aim of spiritual practice is to help you overcome all apparent separa-
tion and become one with spirit completely.
236
Part IV: Meditation in Action 

Dissolving the self
What keeps you separate? Well, some traditions call it ego or self, others call
it personality, pride, self-image, or self-clinging. Essentially, it’s the beliefs and
stories I describe in Chapter 5, the inner turbulence and self-centered preoc-
cupations and patterns that keep you from seeing things clearly. Of course,
these preoccupations and patterns run deep and can take a lifetime (or life-
times!) of dedicated practice to undo, but you can begin to unravel them
using some of the meditative practices described in Chapter 11. (At a deeper
level of understanding, you’re actually never separate from spirit even for an
instant — you just think you are. But therein lies the riddle we all need to
solve. As the great Indian sage Ramana Maharshi used to say, “The only thing
that separates you from the Self is the belief that you’re separate.”)
237
Chapter 14: Cultivating Spirituality
Contemplating a spiritual text
Here’s a meditation that’s as old as the written
word — or even older, since people were mem-
orizing spiritual texts long before they could
write.
1. Begin by sitting quietly, closing your eyes,
and taking a few slow, deep breaths, relax-
ing a little on each exhalation.
2. Take a favorite passage from spiritual lit-
erature and read a few sentences or para-
graphs — just enough to impart some
spiritual truth but not enough to engage
your analytical mind.
If you’re not sure where to turn for material,
you may want to begin with a general
anthology like Stephen Mitchell’s The
Enlightened Heart or Spiritual Literacy by
Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat.
3. Notice how the passage affects you.
Does it make you feel more spacious or
relaxed? Does it inspire you or bring tears
of gratitude or appreciation to your eyes?
Does it remind you of some spiritual experi-
ence or insight you once had?
4. Let the passage continue to act on you.
You can read it again and dwell on it, if you
like, or just allow certain words or phrases
to resonate in your heart and mind. But
don’t think about it or analyze it in your usual
way — just be with the resonance or mois-
ture of truth that it conveys.
5. Consider that the words are merely a box
that holds a precious treasure.
By contemplating the words, you discover
the treasure — but don’t get fixated on the
words.
6. When you feel complete, you can begin
meditating in your usual way.
Or just get up and go about your day.
7. As a word or phrase from the passage
comes to mind during the day, pause for a
moment and allow it to act on you.
The more you read spiritual teachings in this
way, the more you can assimilate them and
gradually make them your own.

As you unravel these patterns, you gradually dissolve the limited self you
thought yourself to be and realize your identity with the greater reality. Again,
this journey can take a long, long time (even lifetimes, if you believe in reincar-
nation), and it may be fraught with difficulties, fears, and uncertainties, as
you’ll discover if you read the biography of any great saint or sage. In addi-
tion, you need to develop a healthy measure of self-love and self-acceptance
to navigate the journey at all. (You also need the guidance of an experienced
teacher. For more on teachers, see the section “How to Find a Teacher — and
Why You May Want to Bother” at the end of this chapter. For more on self-
love, see Chapter 10.)
Expanding the self
In addition to dissolving the self, you can also understand the spiritual jour-
ney as an expansion of identity from the narrow to the vast, until you’re finally
identified with the luminous, eternal vastness itself (also known as spirit or
God). The ancient Indian sages used the model of the five bodies, which are
subtler and subtler levels of identification beginning with the physical body
and moving to identification with the ground of being or greater reality itself.
Here’s a similar model (based on the five bodies and loosely adapted from
the writings of philosopher Ken Wilber) that you may find helpful in under-
standing your own spiritual experiences and unfolding. (Apologies, Ken, for
turning some of your thinking on its head!) Remember that each time you
expand your identity to a new level, you incorporate the level that came
before, instead of leaving it behind.
 Physical body: Some people seem to think of nothing else but eating,
drinking, working, sleeping, and sexing — they’re largely identified with
their physical needs and instincts. Children, too, identify mostly with
this level, though they also have one foot in the spiritual realm, espe-
cially during the first three or four years.
 Persona: As you grow up and interact more with others, you develop a
personality — a set of habits and tendencies and preferences — along
with a self-image based largely on how others see you. Gradually, you
begin to expand your identity to include this social persona, and you
may become preoccupied with how you look or come across or the
other accouterments of a self-image, such as material possessions.
 Mature ego: If you spend enough time exploring your inner life and sort-
ing through your deeper feelings, values, and visions, you may eventually
develop a mature ego — a healthy, well-rounded sense of who you are,
what you want, and how you can contribute to others. People who iden-
tify themselves with their mature egos seem grounded and self-confident
and tend to be self-actualizers — that is, those who express their full
potential as human beings in their relationships and career. According to
traditional Western psychology, the mature ego represents the culmina-
tion of human development.
238
Part IV: Meditation in Action 

 Energy body: The spiritual traditions pick up where secular Western
psychology leaves off. Beyond the body-mind lies the energy body (the
aura that surrounds the physical body), which expands and contracts
depending on your mood, your energy level, and countless other factors.
(Whether you notice it or not, you’re constantly reacting to the energy
bodies of the people you meet.)
The classic exercise for experiencing your energy body goes as follows:
Rub your palms and fingers together vigorously for a few minutes, then
hold them an inch or two apart and notice the energy field between
them. Bring them closer together and farther apart, feeling the energy
get denser and thinner and pulsate as your hands move. To explore this
dimension further, check out the sidebar “Playing with your energy
body” later in this chapter.
People who expand their identities to include their energy body realize
that they’re more than just their body-mind, which opens them to a spir-
itual dimension of being.
 Transpersonal dimension: This broad category encompasses the full
range of nonordinary experiences, from clairvoyance and other forms of
extrasensory perception (ESP), to rapture and bliss, to visions of angels,
gods and goddesses, and other otherworldly beings, to direct communion
with your higher self — or even with a personal manifestation of God. (For
more on rapture and bliss, see Chapter 12.) When you expand your iden-
tity to include these subtler levels of being, you know without doubt that
who you are is far vaster than you once believed, and you begin to access
a higher source of wisdom and compassion as well. (Near-death experi-
ences often fit this category, as do the experiences described in best-
sellers like Conversations with God and The Celestine Prophecy.)
 Glimpses of being: When you experience being directly in all its innate
perfection and completeness, you realize that you’ve never been separate
from whom you really are even for an instant. The Zen masters call such a
direct experience of being kensho — literally, seeing your true nature —
but you may need a number of kenshos before you know who you are
without doubt and stop shifting back to a more limited identification.
 Ground of being: Only the great mystics and sages get this far. Now
you’re one with spirit or the ground of being without separation — in
the words of the Indian scriptures, “You are That.” Sure, you continue to
eat, drink, sleep, and blow your nose, but you never forget even for an
instant who you really are — and your being radiates wisdom and com-
passion to others.
Now that I’ve covered the territory, you can close your book and prepare for
a quiz. No, seriously — people actually do have experiences like the ones I
describe, and I thought you might like to know what you’re getting yourself
239
Chapter 14: Cultivating Spirituality

into if you decide to use your meditation for spiritual purposes. (Again, I
strongly urge you to find a teacher if you do.) The approach of dissolving the
self and the approach of expanding the self ultimately take you to the same
place: the deep inner knowing that you and God or the ground of being are
identical — “not two,” as some teachers put it. Although most spiritual tradi-
tions tend to emphasize one approach over the other, they generally offer
both as alternatives, depending on your inclinations.
240
Part IV: Meditation in Action 
Playing with your energy body
Did you ever have the sense that you were
bigger than your physical body? Or that the
space you occupy expands and contracts
depending on circumstances? (No, I’m not talk-
ing about dieting here.) Did you ever have the
feeling that you had no boundaries and you
went on forever? Well, you’re experiencing the
expansion and contraction of your energy body,
the aura of energy that surrounds your physical
body.
Here’s a little exercise for playing with your
energy body:
1. Begin by sitting quietly; closing your eyes;
and taking a few slow, deep breaths, relax-
ing a little on each exhalation.
2. Spend a few minutes imagining going for a
walk in nature or spending time with
someone you love.
Notice how big you feel.
Then notice how your size (but not your
waistline) changes when you imagine get-
ting stuck in traffic or paying your bills or
getting into an argument.
3. Next, check out your energy body without
imagining anything.
How far do you think it extends beyond your
physical body? Six inches? Several feet?
Does it extend farther in front than behind?
Farther above your body than below into the
ground? Is it thicker than the air, or thinner?
Thicker in some places than in others?
4. Pick a room where you feel comfortable,
stand or sit near the center, and check 
out the boundaries of the room in every
direction.
5. Fill the room with your energy — fill it 
with you!
Imagine it, sense it, visualize it, sing it —
whatever helps you fill the space as much
as you can.
6. Draw your energy back in until it forms a
sphere around you, about 2 or 3 feet away.
Notice how the energy becomes denser.
7. Play with expanding and contracting your
energy in this way several times; then relax
and notice how you feel.
By regularly experimenting with your energy
body, you can acquire a direct understanding of
the spiritual truth that you’re more than your
physical body. (This exercise is adapted from a
series of exercises in the book The Lover Within
by Julie Henderson.)

In the same way, the world’s spiritual traditions differ in the paths they
emphasize. The Judeo-Christian tradition, for example, tends to focus on the
path of devotion, whereas Buddhism for the most part stresses the path of
insight. But those who practice devotion often have profound insights into
the nature of existence, and those who pursue insight may also use devo-
tional practices to assist them in their quest. Besides, some traditions, like
Hinduism and Sufism, emphasize both. (The third principal path, selfless ser-
vice, which involves dedicating every action to spiritual rather than personal
ends, can be used to deepen the experience of either devotion or insight. For
example, Mother Teresa served the poorest of the poor as an expression of
her devotion to Jesus, while the bodhisattvas of the Buddhist tradition serve
others to help free them from the limitations of ignorance.)
The Path of Devotion: In Search of Union
If you believe in the existence of a personal God or have had experiences of a
presence greater than yourself that inspired feelings of awe and reverence,
you may be drawn to the path of devotion. It’s the primary spiritual path in
the Judeo-Christian tradition and Islam and forms one of the main currents of
Hinduism.
Although devotees may feel deeply connected to God and believe that a
spark of divinity shines in their hearts, they often experience themselves to
be painfully separate from God. As the anonymous author of the mystical
Christian text The Cloud of Unknowing puts it, “The person who has a deep
experience of himself existing far apart from God feels the most acute sorrow.
Any other grief seems trivial in comparison.” Through contemplation, mantra
recitation (see the section “Mantra: Invoking the Divine in every moment”
later in this chapter), chanting, selfless service, and other devotional prac-
tices, devotees seek to get closer to God by focusing all of their love and
attention on God — and ultimately, if they’re mystically inclined, to merge
with God completely in a state of ecstatic union.
As a bridge between the self and the Divine (especially when the Divine doesn’t
have a personal face, as in certain schools of Hinduism and Buddhism), devo-
tion may also be directed to the spiritual guide. In the West, for example, the
great Sufi poet Rumi spoke in rapturous terms of his love and reverence for
Shams of Tabriz, his “friend” and teacher; and certain Christian mystics wrote
love letters in which they directed the same devotion to one another as they
directed to God. In the East, some Hindu teachers require the devotion of their
students as an essential step toward spiritual maturity, and Tibetan Buddhists
practice guru yoga, in which they revere the teacher as the embodiment of
their own essential nature. (See the section “Guru yoga: Tibetan devotional
practice” later in this chapter.)
241
Chapter 14: Cultivating Spirituality

Although the path of devotion follows the general guidelines for spirituality
discussed earlier in this chapter, it also has its own unique aspects or phases
of development. (Again, this stuff may seem pretty lofty — but if you’re a
budding mystic, you definitely want to have an overview of the path.) These
phases include the following:
 Developing virtue: In all the great devotional traditions, devotees are
required to prepare themselves for union with God by living a life of
purity and restraint.
 Cultivating a higher octave of love: The devotee may begin by feeling
personal love for God or teacher, but eventually this love evolves into an
unconditional, transpersonal love that knows no bounds and does not
depend on the love object to evoke. (For more on unconditional love,
see Chapter 10.)
 Overcoming duality: Beginning with a painful sense of separation, the
devotee gradually gets closer and closer and ultimately merges with
God, until no trace of separation remains. As the Hindu sage Swami
Vivekananda put it, “Love, the lover, and the beloved are one.”
 Transcending the personal God: Ultimately, the devotee must tran-
scend even God, if God is experienced as having a particular name or
form. At this stage, the lover and the beloved dissolve into God as the
absolute ground of being, the nameless, formless greater reality whose
essence is love.
 Everything is God: The distinctions get pretty subtle at these higher
levels, but here goes: When the devotee no longer needs to contemplate
or meditate in order to experience oneness with God but sees God
everywhere in every moment — waking or sleeping — he or she has
reached the pinnacle of the devotional path. Now that the separate self
and all self-centered striving have fallen away, every activity reflects a
complete alignment with the divine purpose: “Not my will but Thy will
be done.”
To give you a flavor of the devotional path, here are three practices you might
like to try. The first two have their counterparts in all the world’s great spiri-
tual traditions, and the third provides an example of devotional practice in the
Buddhist tradition.
Mantra: Invoking the Divine 
in every moment
Throughout history, meditators and mystics in the great devotional tradi-
tions have recommended the constant recitation of a mantra (a sacred word
or phrase usually transmitted directly from a teacher) to bring the devotee
closer to the Divine. (For more on mantra, see Chapter 3, or listen to Track 2
242
Part IV: Meditation in Action 

on the CD.) At first, you can practice repeating it aloud; then, when you
become proficient, you can repeat it silently to yourself; and ultimately
you can graduate to purely mental recitation (which is considered the most
powerful).
Some practitioners of mantra also manipulate a rosary (or mala in Sanskrit)
to help them keep track, ticking off one bead for each recitation. (You can
buy a basic mala in any meditation supply store or metaphysical bookstore.)
Or you can coordinate the sound with the coming and going of your breath.
Although you might begin by limiting your mantra recitation to a few minutes
or hours of meditation each day, the traditional goal is constant practice. That
is, you want to get to the point where you’re repeating the sound or phrase
nonstop in order to keep your attention focused on the Divine and away from
habitual patterns of thought. Ultimately, your mind will become one-pointed,
and you’ll think always and only of God — which is the first step on the path
to union. (If you watched the movie Gandhi, you may remember that he died
with the mantra “Ram” [one of the Hindu names for God] on his lips.)
Needless to say, you’ll be lucky if you can remember your mantra for a few
minutes at first. But if you’ve received a mantra from a teacher (or know a
mantra you find particularly meaningful or resonant) and you feel strong
devotion, who can say how far you can go in your practice? (For inspiration
on your path, you might like to read the spiritual classic The Way of a Pilgrim,
the anonymous story of a devout Russian Orthodox peasant who chants the
Jesus prayer day and night.)
The practice of the presence of God
Here’s a time-honored practice that has counterparts in all the world’s great
spiritual traditions. When you catch a glimpse of the sacred, you can practice
seeing it everywhere you look, in everyone and everything. One ancient Zen
master used to say “Buddha! Buddha!” to every being he encountered. When
the contemporary Tibetan teacher Kalu Rinpoche visited an aquarium in San
Francisco, he went around tapping the glass to get the fishes’ attention so he
could bless them and wish them happiness and well-being.
The practice is just that simple: Remember to see the sacred or divine in
every being and thing. Brother Lawrence of the Resurrection, a 17th-century
Catholic brother, called it the “practice of the presence of God.” You may
believe that everything is God, or infused by God, or created by God, or has
the spark of divinity inside. Whatever your belief, the practice reminds you to
look not at the surface or at what you like, don’t like, want, or need, but at the
sacred, spiritual dimension that is perpetually present. For those who do this
practice, God, like beauty, is in the eyes of the beholder. (For example, instead
of responding to the stressed-out expression on people’s faces, you may want
to look beyond to the love in their hearts or the gleam in their eyes or the
purity of their essential nature, however hidden.)
243
Chapter 14: Cultivating Spirituality

Of course, the practice may be simple, but it’s certainly not easy. You might
begin by doing it for ten minutes and see how it goes. If you enjoy it, you can
naturally extend it as you feel inspired. (To help you remember, you may
want to repeat a phrase like “This too is divine,” not constantly like a mantra,
but intermittently, as a reminder.)
Guru yoga: Tibetan devotional practice
For the Tibetan Buddhist practitioner, the root teacher, or guru, embodies the
wisdom and compassion of all the enlightened beings throughout space and
time. By invoking the guru and “fervently praying with uncontrived devotion,”
in the words of the great contemporary master Dudjom Rinpoche (quoted in
The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying by Sogyal Rinpoche), “after a while the
direct blessing of the wisdom mind of the master will be transmitted, empower-
ing you with a unique realization, beyond words, born deep within your mind.”
The point of guru yoga, in other words, is to become one with the greater
reality (call it God, spirit, or Buddha nature) by first merging with the mind
and heart of an enlightened master. (In the Tibetan tradition, the wisdom
mind of the guru, which is said to resemble the vastness of the sky, is ulti-
mately identical with being itself.)
Fortunately, you don’t have to be a Tibetan Buddhist to benefit from this
practice. Here’s a brief version that anyone can do (adapted from Sogyal
Rinpoche’s The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying):
1. Sit quietly, close your eyes, and take a few slow, deep breaths, relax-
ing a little with each exhalation.
If you already know how to meditate, you can do so in your usual way
for a few minutes.
2. Imagine in front of you and above your head an enlightened being or
saint for whom you feel particular love or reverence — perhaps
Jesus, Buddha, Moses, or Mother Teresa.
If you don’t gravitate toward saints and sages, just imagine a being of
infinite wisdom and compassion. And if you don’t find it easy to visual-
ize, just sense this being alive in your heart.
3. Intensify the experience by deepening your feelings of inspiration and
devotion.
This being actually exists right here and now, and it embodies the bless-
ings of all the enlightened saints and sages.
4. Relax your body, feel the presence of this being in your heart, and
call on it to help you realize your own essential nature.
5. Allow your mind and heart to merge with the mind and heart of this
enlightened being as you ask to be filled with clarity and compassion.
244
Part IV: Meditation in Action 

6. Continue to merge your mind and heart with those of the enlightened
being as you recite a devotional mantra, if you have one.
(See the section “Mantra: Invoking the Divine in every moment” earlier
in this chapter.) If you don’t have one, just sit with reverence and 
devotion.
7. Gradually feel your mind and heart becoming one with the guru’s —
that is, vast, clear, and luminous like the sky.
8. Imagine that thousands of rays of pure-white light stream from the
guru and penetrate every cell of your body, healing, purifying, and
empowering you completely with the skylike mind of enlightenment.
9. Allow the guru to dissolve into light and become one with you so that
you and the guru are inseparable.
10. Rest for several minutes in the vast, luminous, skylike nature of mind.
Know without doubt that your mind and the mind of the guru are one.
245
Chapter 14: Cultivating Spirituality
Chanting and bowing
Besides meditation and contemplation, the
devotional path usually involves active prac-
tices like chanting, singing, and bowing. As you
may have noticed if you’ve ever sung along with
a gospel choir or chanted Indian devotional
hymns, you can lift your spirits, open your heart,
and intensify your devotion by raising your voice
in praise of the Divine.
If you’re devotionally inclined (or devotionally
impaired!), try mixing your meditation with a little
chanting or singing every now and then. Choose
songs that have resonance or meaning for you.
(For example, I know plenty of Hindus and
Buddhists who love to sing “Amazing Grace.”)
Traditional wisdom suggests that chanting
sacred words and phrases also has the power
to open, stimulate, and harmonize your energy
centers. (For more on energy centers, see
Chapter 12.) In this way, chanting helps “tune
up” your body and prepare it for meditation and
other spiritual practices.
As for bowing: What better way to practice sur-
rendering your self-centered preoccupations
and habitual patterns than by falling down on
your knees on a regular basis? One famous Zen
master wore a perpetual callus on his forehead
from bowing repeatedly to soften his stubborn-
ness. My first Zen teacher used to say,
“Buddhism is a religion of bowing.”
Of course, bowing figures prominently in the
Judeo-Christian tradition and Islam as well; like
meditation, it’s a universally recognized practice
for overcoming separation and approaching the
spiritual dimension of being.
But bowing doesn’t mean giving up your auton-
omy to some outside power or force. When you
bow — to God, Jesus, Buddha, or the picture of
a teacher or saint — you’re ultimately bowing
to your own essential nature.
In fact, I like to think of bowing as an expression
of the essential oneness of inside and outside,
the one bowed to and the one bowing. Or, as
they say in India, “The divine in me bows to the
divine in you.”

The Path of Insight: Discovering 
Who You Are
If you find yourself seeking answers to core spiritual questions like “Who am
I?” or “What is reality?” but don’t have a particular interest in God or devotion,
you may be drawn to the path of insight. Every religious tradition has its ver-
sions or counterparts — Christianity has the via negativa (negative way) of
the desert fathers, Judaism has the mystical practices of Kabbalah, Hinduism
has its nondual teachings (like Advaita Vedanta), and Buddhism focuses pri-
marily on the cultivation of insight.
Unlike devotion, which concentrates the mind on a representation of the
Divine, the path of insight uses direct investigation and awareness of present
experience to see beyond surface appearances to the deeper reality that
underlies them. When you keep questioning and looking deeply into what is
apparently real, you inevitably happen upon the ultimately real — the form-
less, indestructible essence of all appearances. (It’s kind of like peeling the
layers of an onion.)
Now, the point of this approach is not to deny the relative reality of ordinary
people and things (including you and me). Rather, the path of insight gener-
ally teaches that reality has two levels: the relative and the absolute. (See also
the sidebar “Where the vertical meets the horizontal” earlier in this chapter.)
On the relative level, it’s important to make a living, pay the bills, spend time
with family or friends — if you pretend that the relative isn’t real, you’re
going to have some problems. (Traffic court and bankruptcy spring immedi-
ately to mind!) As the Sufis say, “Trust in God, but make sure to tie your
camel to the post.”
At the same time, though, there’s an absolute level — a Divine presence or
sacred dimension that underlies this world and gives it meaning. When you
encounter this level, you see the deeper reality of things, just as the mystic
sees God everywhere she looks. Whether directly or more gradually, the path
of insight in its various incarnations leads you to an experience or knowing of
this absolute level of reality. (In the East, they call this knowing enlightenment
or liberation. In the West, they call it gnosis — the Latin word from which
“knowing” derives.)
Most of the core practices highlighted in this book show you how to investi-
gate your present experience so that you can eventually develop insight. To
give you a glimpse of the absolute level, here are three exercises designed to
cut through your usual way of perceiving things to reveal a deeper reality.
Generally, they work best after you’ve been practicing some basic meditation
technique like following your breath or reciting a mantra.
246
Part IV: Meditation in Action 

Expanding your boundaries
Picking up where the energy body meditation leaves off (see the sidebar
“Playing with your energy body” earlier in this chapter), this technique
shows you that you don’t end with your skin — or with the farthest edges
of the Milky Way, for that matter.
1. Begin by sitting quietly, closing your eyes, and taking a few slow, deep
breaths, relaxing a little on each exhalation.
2. Sense the solidity and density of your body as you usually perceive it.
3. As you inhale, imagine that your head is filling with a soft, clear mist;
and as you exhale, imagine that all solidity and density drain from
your head, leaving it pleasantly empty, spacious, and open to sensa-
tion and life-energy.
Don’t worry; you won’t disappear!
4. Breathe the mist into your neck and throat and breathe out any ten-
sion or density, leaving the area spacious and open.
5. Continue to apply this meditation to your chest, lungs, and heart; your
arms and hands; your abdomen and internal organs; your pelvis, but-
tocks, and genitals; and your thighs, lower legs, and feet.
6. Feel your whole body completely empty, spacious, and open to the
current of life energy.
Rest in this feeling for a few moments without thought or analysis. Enjoy
the buzz!
7. If certain areas still feel dense or solid, breathe into them until they
empty and open.
You may notice that the boundaries of your body are now diffuse —
you’re not sure where you leave off and the outside world begins.
8. Expand the boundaries of your body and your awareness until you
include the whole room and everything it contains.
9. Expand to include the whole building, then the whole block, the
whole town or city, the state.
Take a few minutes with each expansion.
10. Expand even further to encompass the Earth, then the solar system,
the Milky Way, the universe, and beyond the farthest boundaries of
the known universe.
Again, spend a few minutes at each level. You’re vast beyond measure —
you contain everything. Allow any thoughts, feelings, or sensations to
arise within this vast expanse.
247
Chapter 14: Cultivating Spirituality

11. After spending several minutes in the vastness, you can begin to pay
attention to how you feel.
If you find it difficult to locate any feelings, that’s fine — just enjoy the
expansion for a few more minutes! Then check in with your body: Are
you feeling more calm and relaxed than when you began? Has your
breathing changed in any way?
12. Gradually come back to your body before getting up and going about
your day.
Notice whether your self-image or your experience of people and things
has changed in any way.
You can practice the first part of this exercise (emptying and opening) by
itself, if you like; it has the power to calm your mind and relax and harmonize
your body. With regular practice, you’ll be able to create a spacious, open,
radiant feeling in your body with one sweep of your awareness.
Looking into the nature of mind
In Zen, they tell the story of the first Chinese patriarch Bodhidharma, who
supposedly sat for nine years in meditation facing a wall without moving. The
Zen folks credit this legendary character with all kinds of superhuman feats.
For example, he reportedly cut off his eyelids so he could meditate without
sleeping, and the first tea plants sprang up where his eyelids landed. (After
all, tea’s a kinder, gentler way to stay awake.)
Anyway, an earnest monk named Hui-ko came to Bodhidharma and humbly
asked the patriarch to help pacify his troubled mind for him. After refusing to
talk to Hui-ko for several days, Bodhidharma finally told him to find his mind
and bring it to Bodhidharma to pacify. For months, the monk searched for his
mind in meditation. Finally he returned to Bodhidharma and reported that he
couldn’t find it anywhere. “Then I’ve pacified your mind for you,” Bodhidharma
replied — and Hui-ko was immediately enlightened. (You know how these Zen
stories go!)
As this anecdote suggests, the Buddhists have devised some powerful tech-
niques for exploring the mind and realizing its essential nature (which hap-
pens to be the greater reality I mention earlier in this chapter). And you don’t
have to study with a Zen master to get a taste of this essential nature for
yourself. Here’s an exercise I’ve adapted from the Tibetan tradition:
1. Begin by sitting quietly; closing your eyes; and taking a few slow,
deep breaths, relaxing a little with each exhalation.
2. Meditate in your usual way for a few minutes to relax and focus your
mind, then allow it to rest in its “natural state,” as the Tibetans put it,
without doing anything special.
248
Part IV: Meditation in Action 

If you can follow this exercise with your eyes open and gazing straight
ahead at the space in front of you, great — that’s how the Tibetans do it.
But if you get distracted, you can close your eyes.
3. Ask yourself a series of questions, and respond by using your mind to
look directly at mind.
Don’t think about or analyze your mind or become preoccupied with its
contents, such as thoughts or feelings. Instead, just look at your mind
the way you would look at a bird or a tree. You see it and then you rest
your mind there. Take a few minutes to respond to each question.
4. Begin by noticing a particular thought as it arises and endures in your
mind.
For example, you can take a memory, a plan, or a fantasy.
• Does this thought have a particular shape or form? How big is it?
• Does it have a particular color or colors?
• Does it have a beginning, a middle, and an end?
• Where is the thought located? Is it inside or outside your body?
• From where did this thought arise? Where does it go when you’re
no longer thinking it? How long does it last when you continue to
think it?
• Does the thought have substance, or is it just empty, open, and
filled with space? Does it leave a trace in your mind, like footprints
on the beach, or does it leave no trace, like writing on water?
5. Turn your attention to your mind itself and ask the following 
questions.
Remember: I’m talking about the mind here, not the brain. If you believe
your mind resides in your brain, well then, find it and bring it to me!
• Does your mind itself have a shape or form? How big is it? Does it
have a color or colors?
• Is your mind identical with your thoughts, or does it abide as the
ground or space in which your thoughts arise and pass away?
• Where is your mind located? Is it inside or outside your body?
Does it have a beginning or an end?
• Does your mind have substance like the earth, or is it empty and
spacious like the sky? Is it blank and dark, or is it bright and clear?
6. Rest for a few minutes in the nature of your mind before getting up
and going about your day.
249
Chapter 14: Cultivating Spirituality

Asking “Who am I?”
For as long as they’ve had the capacity to reflect on their experience, human
beings have asked, “Who am I?” Zen masters, Sufi sheikhs, Indian sages, Jewish
rabbis, and teachers of virtually every other spiritual tradition have used this
question to help their disciples see beyond their accustomed identities to a
deeper realization of their essential nature.
When you first ask this question, you may come up with the usual answers:
“I’m a woman,” “I’m a father,” “I’m an attorney,” “I’m a runner.” As you probe
further, you may get more-spiritual answers, such as “I’m love incarnate” or
“I’m a child of God.” But if you just set these aside and continue to inquire,
you’ll eventually have a direct intuition of a more fundamental identity that
has nothing to do with who you think you are.
Practice the following exercise with a partner, if possible. (One person begins
by questioning, the other by answering.) If you don’t have a partner handy,
you can do it alone facing a mirror:
1. Sit comfortably facing your partner, gazing at one another in a
relaxed and natural way.
2. Allow the questioner to begin by asking, “Who are you?” Then the
other person responds by saying whatever comes to mind.
3. After a pause, the questioner asks again, “Who are you?” and the
other person again responds.
Of course, if you’re doing it alone, you get to play both roles.
4. Continue in this way for 15 minutes, then switch places for an equal
amount of time.
If you’re the questioner, don’t critique or judge the answers in any way.
Just listen, pause, and ask again.
If you’re the respondent, gently look for an answer, then respond. If you
can’t find one and have nothing to say for a moment or two, just sit with
the silence and the not knowing. You may become flustered or confused,
start to laugh or cry, or have moments of deep stillness.
Accept whatever arises, relax into the process, and keep going. Even a
brief glimpse of who you really are can completely transform your life.
5. When you’re done, sit for a few minutes with your experience before
getting up and going about your day.

How to Find a Teacher — and Why 
You May Want to Bother
If you’d like to play tennis but don’t know how, what do you do? You can
watch other people play, maybe buy a book or two, then head out to the
court yourself and start practicing. But after you’ve mastered the basics, you
may want to take a class or get some personal instruction to help you refine
your stroke or eliminate the mistakes you’ve picked up along the way. Sure,
self-taught prodigies do occasionally make it to the pros — but most good
tennis players who want to improve their game eventually find a teacher.
The same holds true for meditation. You can practice the exercises provided
in this book for weeks, months, or even years and reap the benefits without
additional instruction. But at a certain point, you may encounter difficulties
you don’t know how to handle by yourself (see Chapters 11 and 12). Or you
may start having spiritual experiences that give you glimpses of a greater
reality and whet your appetite for further exploration. To continue moving
forward and refining your meditation practice, you need to find yourself a
teacher.
Choosing the right kind of teacher
Before you can find a teacher, however, you need to know what kind of teacher
you want. Most meditation teachers have a particular spiritual affiliation —
they’re yogis or Zen Buddhists or Christian contemplatives, for example — and
the instruction they offer comes packaged with a particular orientation toward
the spiritual journey as well as particular teachings and terminology. No prob-
lem if that’s what you’re looking for — but if you want your instruction straight,
without any spirituality, you may have a more difficult time finding a teacher.
(For expert, nonsectarian guidance in meditation, you can surf directly over to
my Web site at www.stephanbodian.org, where I describe the workshops
and individual instruction I offer.)
Some hatha yoga teachers offer basic meditation instructions with a mini-
mum of Sanskrit words, and they may even know the territory well enough to
help you if you get stuck. More and more adult-education programs, commu-
nity colleges, and local churches are offering generic meditation or stress-
reduction classes, but you may want to look over the teacher’s credentials
first — he or she may be no further along in practice than you are.
251
Chapter 14: Cultivating Spirituality

If you practice the mindfulness meditations provided in this book (see
Chapter 6, or listen to Track 4 on the CD), you might check out the Vipassana
tradition of Buddhism, also known as insight meditation. Jon Kabat-Zinn,
author of the bestseller Wherever You Go, There You Are, long-time teacher of
Vipassana, and founder of the mindfulness-based Stress Reduction Clinic at
the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, has developed a program
that offers rigorous training to prospective instructors of basic mindfulness
practices. Or you could just take a class in Vipassana, use what you find
meaningful and helpful, and leave the rest. Many teachers go light on the
Buddhism, especially in introductory courses.
If you’re drawn to a particular spiritual tradition or path, you should have
less trouble finding a teacher. But you still may want to consider beforehand
what kind of teacher you need. Here are four major categories of teachers,
based on the content of their teachings and their relationships with their stu-
dents. (The terms I use here won’t necessarily show up on a teacher’s résumé
or brochure; they’re just my way of making sense of the different roles teach-
ers play. Some teachers may be a combination of several or all four.)
 Instructor: Teaches you techniques, offers good advice on how to imple-
ment them, and helps you troubleshoot or fine-tune. May be a friend or
peer.
 Mentor: Gives you personal encouragement and support in your prac-
tice, offers guidance for getting unstuck, and provides a role model of
someone who’s been there before you. Usually teaches techniques as
well.
 Pandit: Transmits knowledge by articulating and explaining spiritual
teachings and texts. May be a scholar as well as a meditator.
 Master: Embodies the essence of the spiritual teachings. Helps you
break through your stuck places and facilitates the process of expanding
or dissolving the self. May (or may not) have an intense or challenging
relationship with students.
Why you may need a teacher
As I mentioned earlier, a meditation instructor can help you refine your prac-
tice and deal with basic questions that arise along the way. But if you want to
deepen your practice and use it as a means to spiritual ends (as described
earlier in this chapter), you’ll definitely want to find a spiritual mentor or
master.
First of all, you may encounter difficulties and challenges like the ones
described in Chapters 11 and 12. For example, you may have trouble dealing
with intense recurring emotions like anger or fear. Or you may come up
against roadblocks like doubt or procrastination and not know how to move
forward on your own. Or perhaps you start having powerful currents of
252
Part IV: Meditation in Action 

energy running up and down your spine and don’t know how to make them
stop. Suddenly you’re in need of a teacher — pronto!
As you continue on your journey, you may encounter genuine spiritual insights
and experiences that you don’t know how to revisit or sustain. In fact, the
process of spiritual unfolding more often resembles a confusing, trackless out-
back than a “path,” as it is euphemistically called. The truth is, you never know
what you’re going to encounter when you practice intensively. As you experi-
ment with expanding or dissolving yourself in your meditation, for example,
you may meet with powerful opposition from the forces of your psyche that
don’t want you to change. After all, we’re talking radical transformation here —
and most of us resist even the most minor changes in our lives.
Your spiritual teacher may coach and support you through the transforma-
tional process and even accelerate it by confronting the ways in which you
resist or hold back. Some teachers act more like spiritual friends, treating you
with the camaraderie and equality you expect from a peer, while also sharing
their wealth of understanding. Others act more like traditional gurus, trans-
mitting their understanding directly to you while actively pushing against
your stuck places. (Of course, many teachers lie somewhere between these
two extremes and combine a little of both styles.)
Whatever their approach, however, all good teachers help create and sustain,
through their relationship with you, a sacred vessel or space in which the dif-
ficult, wondrous, and ultimately liberating process of spiritual transformation
can take place inside you.
What to look for in a teacher
Before I suggest what to look for in a teacher, I’d like to encourage you to
examine your expectations and preconceptions. When you think of a spiritual
teacher, what images or ideas come to mind? Perhaps you envision a clois-
tered monastic dressed in earth-colored robes who gives you spiritual coun-
sel in hushed tones and then returns to his cell to continue his practice. Or
maybe you think of a joyful, expansive being who lives in the world and radi-
ates love and light wherever she goes.
Some people idealize the teacher and expect him to be perfect — and become
disillusioned when it turns out he’s not. Others go to the other extreme and
have difficulty treating anyone with reverence or letting go long enough of their
staunchly held opinions to allow the wisdom of others to enter. In the West, we
tend to distrust authority and believe, like our pioneer and cowboy predeces-
sors, that we can do it all ourselves. Besides, look at all those preachers,
priests, and self-styled gurus, you may say, who get caught with their pants
down. Although a healthy dose of skepticism can do wonders, too much can
make you shy away from teachers (and hence from spiritual practice) entirely.

Consulting the guru inside you
Before you go searching for a spiritual teacher,
you may want to check out your own inner
source of guidance and wisdom. Ultimately, it’s
the only thing you can really trust, and a good
teacher will help you locate it. Yes, that’s right,
even you have a guru inside you. As Jesus said,
“Seek and you shall find; knock and the door
will open to you.” Well, here’s an exercise for
seeking and finding:
1. Begin by sitting quietly; closing your eyes;
and taking a few slow, deep breaths, relax-
ing a little with each exhalation.
2. Take a few minutes to imagine yourself in a
safe, comfortable, relaxing, peaceful
place, using all your senses to make the
experience as vivid as possible.
3. As you explore this peaceful place, you
may begin to sense the presence of a wise
and compassionate being.
Know that this being represents your higher
self or deepest truth. (Feel free to use what-
ever words you prefer to name this being.)
You may sense this presence somewhere in
your body, or you may just intuit that it’s
there. If you don’t immediately sense this
presence, continue to enjoy your peaceful
place as you invite this presence to appear
to you.
4. Imagine yourself settling down in a partic-
ular spot and gazing out in front of you,
relaxed and open.
5. Gradually, this wise and compassionate
being materializes in the space in front of
you.
Notice how it appears to you. It may take
the form of a wise old man or woman or a
Zen master or Christian contemplative, or it
may appear as a rose or a tree or (if you’re
not visually inclined) merely a feeling in your
belly or heart. Or it may just be an older,
wiser version of you.
6. Take whatever form appears to you and
treat it with the respect and reverence you
would reserve for a spiritual teacher.
Note: If this being seems critical or punitive
in any way, it’s not the one you’re looking
for, so ask it to step aside and invite the real
one to appear.
7. Spend a few minutes of silence in the pres-
ence of this wise and compassionate
being.
You might imagine it radiating light and love
in all directions as you silently receive what
it has to offer.
8. Take a few minutes or longer to ask any
questions you have and receive answers.
Don’t worry if this exchange seems strange
or awkward at first; with practice, you’ll find
that this being develops a voice of its own.
9. Before you say good-bye, you might ask
this being to give you a gift that represents
exactly the qualities you’re needing right
now.
10. When you feel complete, thank this being
for spending time with you today.
Tell it that you would like to meet again in
the future and say good-bye for now.
11. Gradually shift your awareness to your
sensate experience and open your eyes.
12. Take some time to reflect on your experi-
ence and the answers and gifts you
received.

Whatever your expectations and preconceptions, you may need to set them
aside when you look for a teacher because he or she may appear in a guise
you don’t anticipate. At the same time, you may want to compare your
prospective teacher against the following checklist of qualities that the best
teachers embody — in my humble estimation, at least. (I’ve based this list on
my own observation over more than 35 years of spiritual practice.) Not all
teachers will have every one of these characteristics, of course, but the
more, the better:
 They’re humble, ordinary, down-to-earth, not arrogant or inflated. In
Zen monasteries, the head monk cleans the toilets.
 They’re honest, straightforward, and clear, not evasive or defensive.
As people gain spiritual maturity, they become increasingly free of psy-
chological baggage.
 They encourage independent thinking and open inquiry in their stu-
dents, rather than blind obedience to a particular dogma or ideology.
 They’re primarily concerned with the spiritual development of
their students, not with fame, power, influence, or the size of their
organization.
 They practice what they preach, rather than considering themselves
exempt from the moral and ethical guidelines that others must follow.
 They embody the highest spiritual qualities, such as kindness,
patience, equanimity, joy, peace, love, and compassion.
How to find a teacher
The process of finding a teacher can be as mysterious as the spiritual journey
itself. For some people, it’s a lot like finding a lover or a mate — it involves a
complex mixture of luck, availability, and chemistry. For others, it’s simply a
matter of following the counsel of a friend or showing up at the right place at
the right time. I met my first teacher after looking up Zen in the local phone
book. Other people I know met their teachers in dreams before encountering
them in the flesh. In the words of a popular Indian expression, “When the stu-
dent is ready, the teacher appears.”
Ultimately, you need to trust your intuition, your own inner knowing, when
choosing a teacher — it’s the only reliable equipment you have for navigating
in this flawed phenomenal universe of ours. The best advice I ever received
from a teacher came from a Tibetan lama, who touched my chest near my
heart and said, “The true guru is inside you.” (For instructions on how to
meet your inner teacher, see the sidebar “Consulting the guru inside you” or
listen to Track 11 on the CD.)
255
Chapter 14: Cultivating Spirituality

I’ve found myself drawn to teachers intuitively because of the qualities of being
they seem to radiate. On the other hand, I’ve also stumbled on teachers unex-
pectedly through a serendipitous sequence of events. Be open but not gullible,
skeptical but not cynical. Feel free to ask questions, expect good answers, and
take your time. According to the Dalai Lama, Tibetan students may spend years
checking out teachers to make sure they embody the teachings they espouse.
Just as you wouldn’t rush into a marriage, you shouldn’t rush into anything as
intimate and deep as a relationship with a spiritual teacher.

Discovering the sky of mind
Here’s a brief meditation that you can do any-
time you’re outdoors to give you a taste of the
vastness of your essential nature, which the
Zen folks call, appropriately enough, “big mind.”
1. Preferably on a clear day, sit or lie down
and look up at the sky.
Set aside your analytical mind for now and
all you think you know about the sky.
2. Take a few minutes to contemplate the
vastness of the sky, which appears to
stretch endlessly in every direction.
3. Gradually allow your mind to expand to fill
the sky — up and down, north and south,
east and west.
Let go of all sense of personal boundaries
as you fill the sky with your awareness.
4. Become the sky completely and rest in the
experience for a few minutes.
5. Gradually return to your ordinary sense of
yourself.
How do you feel? Has your awareness
changed in any way?
After you get the knack of this exercise, you can
do it for brief moments at any time of the day —
for example, while walking your dog in the
morning or gazing out your window on a break
at work — to remind yourself who you are.

E
lsewhere in this book, I compare meditation to a laboratory in which you
experiment with paying attention to your experience and discovering how
to cultivate qualities like peace, love, and happiness. Well, the discoveries you
make in the controlled environment of a lab have only limited value until you
can apply them to real-life situations and problems — and the skills, insights,
and peaceful feelings you have on your meditation cushion won’t get you far
unless you do the same. In fact, that’s the whole point of meditation — to help
you live a happier, fuller, more stress-free life!
As you become more adept at being mindful during formal meditation, you
naturally get better at paying mindful attention to everything you encounter,
both on and off the cushion. Still, you may find it helpful to pick up a few tips
on how to extend the practice of mindfulness so you can stay open, present,
and attentive from moment to moment, even in the midst of challenging cir-
cumstances like driving a car in heavy traffic, running errands, doing chores,
taking care of the kids, or dealing with stressful situations at work. In addi-
tion, you can find out how to use meditation to improve the quality of your
family life and your intimate relationships, including the most intimate
encounter of all — making love.
Being Peace with Every Step: Extending
Meditation in Action
Here’s a quote that expresses the spirit of meditation-in-action better than
anything I could possibly say. It comes from the book Peace Is Every Step by
the Vietnamese Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh.

Every morning, when we wake up, we have twenty-four brand-new hours
to live. What a precious gift! We have the capacity to live in a way that
these twenty-four hours will bring peace, joy, and happiness to ourselves
and others. . . . Every breath we take, every step we make, can be filled
with peace, joy, and serenity. We need only to be awake, alive in the pre-
sent moment.
The person who wrote these words is neither a recluse nor a Pollyanna; he’s
had experience practicing mindfulness in extraordinarily difficult times.
During the Vietnam War, he worked tirelessly for reconciliation between the
warring factions in his homeland and created and headed the Buddhist Peace
Delegation to the Paris Peace Talks. For his efforts, Martin Luther King nomi-
nated him for a Nobel Peace Prize. Since then, Thich Nhat Hanh has actively
taught a blend of mindful living and social responsibility, and wherever he
goes he embodies the peace he espouses.
As Nhat Hanh suggests, you need to be awake and alive in the present
moment — after all, it’s the only moment you have. Even memories of the
past and thoughts of the future occur right now, in the present. If you don’t
wake up and smell the flowers, taste your food, and see the light in your
loved ones’ eyes, you’ll miss the beauty and preciousness of your life as it
unfolds. Says Thich Nhat Hanh: “Each thought, each action in the sunlight of
awareness becomes sacred.”
On a more practical level, you can only reduce stress by getting out of your
head (where all the stressful thoughts and emotions vie for your attention)
and showing up for what’s happening right now. Once you learn how to be
present in your meditation, you need to keep being present again and again,
moment after moment — otherwise, you’ll just fall back into your old stress-
ful habits. Besides, mindful awareness of what you’re doing and experiencing
can confer tremendous benefits, including the following:
 Greater focus, efficiency, and precision in what you do
 An experience of effortlessness, flow, and harmony
 Reduced stress, because the mind is not distracted by its habitual 
worries and concerns
 Increased enjoyment of the richness and fullness of life
 Greater availability or presence and the capacity to open your heart and
be touched or affected by others
 Deeper connections with loved ones and friends
 An openness to the spiritual dimension of life
258
Part IV: Meditation in Action 

Now, you don’t have to be a Buddhist monk to practice mindfulness — you
can wake up and be mindful in the midst of the most mundane activities. But
you can certainly take advantage of some of the techniques and tricks that
the great meditation teachers have devised, which I describe in the following
sections.
Coming back to your breath
Sometimes you feel like you’re just moving too quickly and dealing with too
many matters at once to know how (or where) to be mindful. “Where do I
place my attention,” you may wonder, “when things are happening so fast?”
Just as you can begin the formal practice of mindfulness meditation by count-
ing or following your breaths (see Chapter 6), you can always return to the
direct and simple experience of breathing, even in the most complicated cir-
cumstances. No matter how many other things you may be doing, you’re
always breathing — and the physical experience of inhaling and exhaling pro-
vides a reliable anchor for your attention in stressful times. Then, when
you’ve begun to pay attention to your breath, you can gradually expand to
include mindful awareness of your other activities.
Besides, gently paying mindful attention to your breath gradually calms your
mind by shifting awareness away from your thoughts and slowing your mind
down to the pace and rhythms of your body. With your mind and body in
synch, you start to feel a natural ease and an inner harmony and tranquillity
that external circumstances can’t easily disturb.
You can begin by stopping whatever you’re doing for a moment or two and
tuning in to the coming and going of your breath. Your attention may be
drawn to the rise and fall of your abdomen as you breathe, or to the feeling of
your breath as it enters and leaves your nostrils. Be mindful of these sensa-
tions for four or five breathing cycles, enjoying the simplicity and directness
of the experience. When you breathe with awareness, you’re consciously
awake and alive in the present moment. Then resume your normal activities
while continuing to be mindful of your breath. (If you find this multidimen-
sional awareness too confusing or complicated, you can just remember to
come back to your breath every now and then.)
Listening to the bell of mindfulness
Monasteries traditionally use bells and gongs to remind the monks and nuns
to stop whatever they’re doing, drop their thoughts and daydreams, and
gently return their attention to the present moment. Because you and I don’t
live with bells, Thich Nhat Hanh suggests that we use the recurring sounds of
our environment to gently remind us to wake up and be mindful.

Part IV: Meditation in Action 
Enjoying your meal with mindful eating
Did you ever finish a meal and wonder what
happened to the food? You can remember
enjoying it at first, and then suddenly you notice
that your plate is empty, and you can’t recall a
single bite in between. Perhaps you spent the
time talking with a friend or reading a newspa-
per or worrying about your bank account or
your relationship.
Here’s a meditation to help you be mindful of
what you’re putting into your mouth. Not only
will you enjoy your food as never before, but
mindful eating will facilitate your digestion by
reducing any tension or stress you bring to the
table. (You probably won’t want to eat as medi-
tatively as this all the time, but you can still apply
a little mindfulness to every meal, no matter how
informal.)
1. Before you begin eating, take a few
moments to appreciate your food.
You may want to reflect Zen-style on the
earth and the sunshine that gave life to this
food and the people and effort that brought
it to your table. Or you can express your
thanks to God or spirit — or simply sit
silently and feel grateful for what you have.
If you’re eating with others, you may want
to hold hands, smile at one another, or con-
nect in some other way.
2. Bring your awareness to your hand as you
lift the first bite of food to your lips.
You can experiment with the custom in cer-
tain monastic traditions of eating more
slowly than usual. Or just eat at your usual
speed, but be as mindful as you can.
3. Be fully aware as the first morsel of food
enters your mouth and floods your taste
buds with sensations.
Notice the tendency of the mind to judge
the flavor: “It’s too spicy or salty,” or “It’s not
what I expected.” Notice any emotions that
might get stirred up: disappointment, relief,
irritation, joy. Be aware of any ripples of
pleasure or warmth or other physical sen-
sations. Enjoy your food!
4. If you talk while you eat, notice how the
talking affects you.
Do certain topics cause you to tense up or
give you indigestion? Does the talk take you
away from the enjoyment of your meal, or
can you have both?
5. Stay mindful of each mouthful as you grad-
ually eat your meal.
This part is probably the hardest because
most people have a tendency to space out
once they know how their food tastes. But
you can continue to enjoy the taste freshly,
bite after bite. (If you get distracted, you can
stop and breathe for a moment or two
before starting to eat again.)
6. To facilitate your mindfulness, you may
want to eat in silence every now and then.
It may feel strange or uncomfortable at first,
but you may find that a quiet meal can pro-
vide a nourishing respite from the pressures
of life.

For example, you can set the beeper on your alarm watch to sound every hour,
and when it does, you can stop, enjoy your breathing for a minute or two, and
then resume your normal activities (with greater awareness, of course). Or you
can hear the mindfulness bell in the ring of your telephone or the sound of
your computer booting up or the buzzer that goes off in your car before you
fasten your seatbelt. Just remember to stop, enjoy your breathing, and keep
going with greater awareness and aliveness.
Even nonsounds make great reminders. Whenever you encounter a red light
in traffic, for example, instead of indulging your frustration or anxiety, you
can remember to tune in, breathe consciously, and let go of your tension and
speed. Or you can allow moments of beauty to help you wake up — a beauti-
ful flower, the smile on a child’s face, sunlight through your window, a warm
cup of tea. Then again, you can always buy a traditional meditation bell and
strike it every now and then as a special reminder.

Chapter 15: How to Meditate in Everyday Life
Freeing yourself from the tyranny of time
Many people feel that their appointment books
run their lives and leave them no room for con-
necting with themselves or the people they love.
But you don’t have to let your clock control you.
You may not be able to free up your schedule,
but you can definitely free up your relationship
to time.
Here are a few pointers for doing just that
(adapted from the book Full Catastrophe Living
by Jon Kabat-Zinn):
 Remember that time is a useful convention
created by our minds to help organize our
experiences. It has no absolute reality, as
Einstein discovered. When you’re enjoying
yourself, time just flies by; when you’re bored
or in pain, minutes seem to last forever.
 Live in the present moment as much as pos-
sible. Because time is created by thought,
you drop into a timeless dimension when
you bypass the thinking mind and settle
your attention in the here and now. As soon
as you start planning for the future or
regretting the past, you’re immediately
bound by the pressures of time once again.
 Take some time to meditate each day.
Meditation teaches you how to be present
and provides the most effective entree into
the realm of the timeless. As Jon Kabat-Zinn
puts it, “Just making the commitment to
practice non-doing, to let go of striving, to
be non-judgmental . . . nourishes the time-
less in you.”
 Simplify your life. When you fill up your life
with trivial pursuits and habits that squan-
der time, it’s no wonder you don’t have
enough for the things that really matter to
you. Take stock of what you do with your
day, and consider letting go of a few activi-
ties that don’t feed your deeper intention to
slow down and connect with yourself.
 Remember that your life belongs to you.
Even though you may have a family to take
care of or a job that requires your attention,
keep in mind that you have the right to
apportion your time as you choose. You’re
not cheating the other people in your life if
you take a half hour for yourself each day to
meditate. 

Repeating a phrase to help 
yourself be mindful
The Jewish tradition has special prayers for just about every occasion —
from seeing a bolt of lightning to eating a piece of bread — that are designed
to remind the faithful that God is constantly present. Buddhists use short
verses to encourage them to come back to the unadorned simplicity of being
in each moment. Christians say grace before meals, at bedtime, and on other
auspicious occasions. Unlike mantras — words or brief phrases repeated
again and again (described in Chapter 13) — these verses or prayers differ
from one situation to the next and have a unique message to impart.
For example, Thich Nhat Hanh suggests silently intoning the following verse
to enhance your mindfulness and turn your conscious breathing into an
opportunity to relax and enjoy your life:
Breathing in, I calm my body.
Breathing out, I smile.
Dwelling in the present moment,
I know this is a wonderful moment.
Coordinate the first line with the inhalation, the second line with the exhala-
tion, and so forth — and be sure to do what you’re saying. That is, calm your
body, smile to yourself (see the sidebar “Practicing a half smile” later in this
chapter), and appreciate this present moment. When you get the knack, you
can simply say, “Calming, smiling, present moment, wonderful moment.” If
you don’t cotton to Nhat Hanh’s terminology, feel free to make up verses of
your own for everyday situations like breathing, eating, bathing, working,
even talking on the phone or going to the bathroom.
Noticing how situations affect you
When you begin to expand your formal mindfulness practice from your
breathing to the full range of your sensory experience (see Chapters 6 and
11), you can bring this inner awareness to your other activities as well.
Instead of losing touch with yourself as you watch TV or drive your car or
work at your computer, you can maintain what one of my teachers calls dual
awareness — that is, simultaneous awareness of what’s going on around you
and of how the situation or activity affects you.
262
Part IV: Meditation in Action 

Gradually you may start to notice that driving too fast makes you tense, or
watching certain TV shows leaves you nervous or agitated, or talking for
hours on the phone just saps your energy rather than enlivening you. You
don’t need to make any judgments or formulate any improvements based on
what you discover. Just gently take note. If you’re highly motivated to reap
the benefits of the meditation you practice so diligently, you’ll find yourself
naturally moving away from situations (like habits, leisure pursuits, people,
and work environments) that stress you out and gravitating to situations that
support you in feeling calm, relaxed, harmonious, and connected with your-
self and others.
263
Chapter 15: How to Meditate in Everyday Life
Taking meditation to work with you
With tight deadlines, performance reviews, and
the threat of downsizing, today’s highly compet-
itive work environment places extraordinary
pressures on employees and managers alike.
Even practitioners of traditionally stable occu-
pations like teaching and medicine are experi-
encing unprecedented work stress with the
advent of larger class sizes and HMOs. But
whatever your job situation, you can reduce
your stress by following these tips for meditat-
ing while you work:
 Each morning before you leave, you can
reinforce your resolve to stay as calm and
relaxed as possible. If you can, meditate
briefly before you head out the door to set
the tone of the day.
 By being mindful of your experience, you
can discover the situations that really stress
you out — and then avoid or change them
as much as possible. Work can be demand-
ing enough without taking on more than you
can handle.
 Notice how your mind adds to stress — for
example, by feeding you negative self-
statements like “I’m a failure” or “I don’t
have what it takes” or by imagining that
you’re about to get canned or that your boss
and co-workers are plotting against you.
Gently set these fabrications aside and
return to paying mindful attention to what-
ever you’re doing.
 Instead of hanging around the coffee
machine and adding caffeine to your long
list of stressors, use your breaks to meditate
quietly in your office or cubicle. You’ll get up
feeling more relaxed and refreshed.
 Have lunch with people you like — or have
a quiet lunch alone. You can also take a
walk or do some other kind of exercise
during your break — a great way to relieve
your stress.
 Every hour take a few moments to stop
what you’re doing, take some deep breaths,
follow your breathing, and get up and
stretch or walk around.
 Practice using a half smile to radiate well-
being to yourself and your co-workers.
When you have contact with others, do it
with a warm and friendly attitude. One med-
itator I know reported that he single-hand-
edly reversed the negative mood in his
office by deliberately smiling and generat-
ing good-will.

When your suffering and stress are based on your own habitual patterns and
difficult emotions (see Chapter 11), you can use dual awareness to notice
your reactivity and create space inside to experience and make friends with
it, instead of acting it out in relation to others.
Applying meditation to familiar activities
Anything you do or experience can provide you with an opportunity to practice
mindfulness. But you may want to begin with some of your usual activities —
the ones you may be doing now on automatic pilot while you daydream, space
out, or obsess. The truth is, even the most routine tasks can prove enjoyable
and enlivening when you do them with wholehearted care and attention. In the
following section, I list common activities with a few suggestions for infusing
them with mindfulness.
Washing the dishes
If you set aside your judgments, which may insist you should be doing some-
thing more meaningful or constructive with your time, and instead simply
wash the dishes — or sweep the floor or scrub the tub — you may find that
you actually enjoy the activity. Feel the contours of the plates and bowls as
you clean them. Notice the smell and the slipperiness of the soap, the sounds
of the utensils, the satisfying feeling of removing the old food and leaving the
dishes clean and ready for use.
Working at your computer
As you become engrossed in the information flashing across your screen, you
may find yourself losing touch with your body and your surroundings. Pause
every now and then to follow your breathing and notice how you’re sitting. If
you’re starting to tense up and crane your head forward, gently straighten
your spine (as described Chapter 7) and relax your body. During recurring
gaps in the flow of your work, come back to your body, breathe, and relax.
Driving your car
What could possibly be more stressful than navigating an automobile
through heavy traffic? Besides the constant stop and go, you need to be
aware of potential problems in every direction, any one of which could pose
a threat to your safety. Yet you add to the stress of driving when you hurry to
get to your destination faster than you realistically can and then get angry
and impatient in the process.
As an antidote to the stress, you can practice mindfulness while you drive.
Take a few deep breaths before you start and return to your breathing again
and again as you consciously let go of tension and stress. Feel the steering
264
Part IV: Meditation in Action 

wheel in your hands, the pressure of your feet against the pedals, the weight
of your body against the seat. Notice any tendency to criticize other drivers,
to space out, to become angry or impatient. Pay attention to how the music
or talk shows you listen to affect your mood as you drive. When you wake up
and pay attention, you may be surprised to realize that you and the people
around you are actually piloting these 2,000-pound chunks of plastic and
steel with precious, vulnerable beings inside. And you may feel more inclined
to drive mindfully and safely as a result.
Talking on the phone
As you engage in conversation, stay connected with your breathing and notice
how you’re affected. Do certain topics bring up anger, fear, or sadness? Do
others bring up pleasure or joy? Do you become reactive or defensive? Notice
also what moves or motivates you to speak. Are you attempting to influence or
convince this person in some way? Do you have a hidden agenda of jealousy 
or resentment — or possibly a desire to be loved or appreciated? Or are you
simply open and responsive to what’s being said in the moment, without the
overlay of past or future?
Watching TV
Just as when you work at a computer, you can easily forget you have a body
when you tune in to the tube. (For more on meditation and TV, see Chapter 8.)
Take a break during commercials to turn down the sound, follow your breath-
ing, and ground your awareness in the present moment. Walk around, look out
the window, connect with your family members. (Like many people, you may
use food to ground you in your body while you’re watching TV, but it won’t
work unless you’re mindful of what you’re eating — and besides, mindless
eating has its price, as any couch potato can tell you.)
Working out
Physical exercise offers you a wonderful opportunity to shift your aware-
ness from your mind to the simple, repetitive movements of your body.
Unfortunately, many people just put on the headphones, switch on the
Walkman, and space out. The next time you hit the exercise equipment or
attend an aerobics class, make a point of following your breathing as much as
you can. (Even if the routine is a challenging one, you can still keep coming
back to your breath.) Or simply be mindful of your body as you move — the
flexing of your muscles, the contact with the equipment (or the floor), the
feelings of warmth or pleasure or strain. Notice also what takes you away. Do
you worry about your body image or obsess about your weight? Do you fan-
tasize about your new physique and so forget to be present for what’s hap-
pening right now? Just notice, and then return to your experience. You may
start enjoying your body so much that you stop caring how others see it.

The Family That Meditates Together:
Partners, Children, and Other Loved Ones
If you’re a budding meditator, family life poses a twofold challenge. On the
one hand, you may feel inclined to invite, encourage, or even coerce your
loved ones to meditate with you. On the other, you may find that the people
closest to you disturb your fragile, newfound peace of mind in ways that no
one else can.
For example, only your spouse or partner may know precisely the words that
can pique your anger or evoke your hurt. And your children may have a unique
capacity to try your patience or challenge your attachment to having situations
be a certain way. (If you’ve ever tried to relax and follow your breathing while
your toddler throws a tantrum or your teenager tries to explain why he came
home at 2 a.m. the night before, you know what I’m talking about.)
You can definitely find ways of incorporating the formal practice of medita-
tion into your closest relationships, as long as your loved ones are respon-
sive to your efforts. But whether or not they have any interest in meditation,
266
Part IV: Meditation in Action 
Attention, attention, attention!
With its emphasis on hard work and its appre-
ciation of the ordinary, the Zen tradition has
many stories that extol the benefits of mindful
awareness in everyday activities. Here are two
of my favorites.
In the first, a businessman comes to see a
famous master and asks him to draw the
Japanese characters that most precisely
express the spirit of Zen. The master draws just
one word: attention.
“But there must be more to Zen than this,” the
businessman complains.
“Yes, you’re right,” the master replies, and he
draws the same character beneath the first:
Attention, attention.
Now the businessman becomes angry. “You’re
just putting me on,” he fumes, his face 
turning red.
Silently, the master adds a third character and
shows it to his volatile guest. Now the scroll
reads: Attention, attention, attention.
In the second story, a wandering monk arrives
at a famous monastery and starts climbing the
path that leads up the mountain when he
notices a lettuce leaf floating down the moun-
tain stream. “Hmm,” he muses to himself,
“any master who lets his disciples prepare the
food so carelessly doesn’t merit my time and
attention.”
Just as he’s turning around to leave, he sees the
head cook himself, robe fluttering in the breeze,
hurrying down the path to retrieve the wayward
leaf.
“Ah,” the visiting monk thinks as he changes
direction once again, “perhaps I should stop
here and study for a while after all!”

you can still use the ties that bind you to them as an exceptional opportunity
to pay mindful attention to your habitual patterns of reacting and behaving.
(For more on how to do this, see Chapter 11.) Ultimately, in fact, family life
has the capacity to open your heart as no other circumstance can.
Meditating with kids
When you become enthusiastic about meditation yourself, you may want to
pass on the benefits to your children (or grandchildren or godchildren or
nephews and nieces). Or they may simply notice that you’re spending time
every day sitting quietly, and they may become interested in joining you.
(Younger kids especially will imitate just about anything their parents do.) If
your children express curiosity, by all means give them brief instructions and
invite them to meditate with you — but don’t expect them to stick with it.
Younger children have limited attention spans, and older ones may have
other interests they find more compelling.
As you may have noticed, children under the age of 6 or 7 already spend 
much of their time in an altered state of wonder and delight (when they’re not
screaming at the top of their lungs, of course). Instead of teaching them how
to meditate in some formal way, join them where they are as much as you can.
Draw their attention to the little, wondrous details of life and encourage them
to observe without interpretation. Pick up a leaf and examine it closely with
them, watch the ants on the ground, gaze together at the stars in the night sky.
To protect the development of their natural capacity to meditate, limit TV and
video time, which stifles curiosity and fantasy, and avoid pushing them to
develop their intellects too soon.
If older kids show interest, feel free to introduce formal meditation practices
such as following the breath or reciting a mantra, but keep them light and fun
as much as possible — and let the kids do the practices or not, as they feel
moved. Meditation will actually have its greatest impact on your children by
making you calmer, happier, more loving, and less reactive. As they watch you
change for the better, your kids may naturally be drawn to meditation because
they want to reap the same benefits for themselves.
Meditating with partners 
and family members
Like prayer, meditation can draw a family closer. (By family, I’m also referring
to partners and spouses.) When you sit together in silence, even for a few
minutes, you naturally attune to a deeper level of being, where differences and
conflicts don’t seem so important. You can also practice specific techniques in
which, for example, you practice opening your hearts and sending and receiv-
ing love to and from one another (see the sidebar “Connecting more deeply
267
Chapter 15: How to Meditate in Everyday Life

with a partner or friend”). If your family members are willing, you can incorpo-
rate meditative practices into your usual routine — for example, by sitting 
quietly together for a few moments before dinner or by reflecting before bed on
the good things that happened during the day.
Family rituals offer a wonderful opportunity to practice mindfulness together
and to connect in a deeper, more heartful way. If you invite your family mem-
bers to join you as you cook a meal or work in the garden mindfully, they may
begin to notice the quality of your attention and follow your lead. Of course,
you can always suggest cooking or eating or working in a new and different
way (you may prefer to use words like love and care, rather than mindfulness),
but your example will have a greater impact than the instructions you give.
You can also practice eating meditation with your family occasionally (see the
sidebar “Enjoying your meal with mindful eating” earlier in this chapter) —
but be sure to keep it playful, loving, and relaxed.
Meditative lovemaking
“Why would I want to meditate while I make love?” you may wonder. “My
partner and I have a great time already — what could we possibly add to the
experience?” Well, I have an appealing answer for you: You can enhance your
lovemaking enormously by giving it your wholehearted and undivided atten-
tion. Many people make love with their minds — they fantasize about sex not
only when they’re alone but when they’re having sex with their partner as
well. But the real lovemaking happens in the here and now, touch after touch,
sensation after sensation. When you’re spacing out or daydreaming, you miss
the best part — and reduce your pleasure and satisfaction in the process.
268
Part IV: Meditation in Action 
Hugging wholeheartedly
Instead of practicing formal meditation with
your children, you can turn the simple, everyday
act of hugging into an opportunity to breathe
and be present. The next time you hug your kids,
notice how you hold them. Do you tense up or
keep them at a distance? Do you hold your
breath, space out, or withhold your love
because you’re irritated or upset? Do you rush
through the hug so you can get on with other,
“more important” things? You may be surprised
by what you discover. (Of course, you may be
quite happy with the way you hug, in which
case feel free to ignore the rest of this sidebar!)
Instead of judging yourself, you may want to
practice a different way of hugging. The next
time you embrace your kids (or your partner or
friends or other family members), pause while
you hold them, relax your body, and breathe in
and out with awareness three or four times. If
you’re so inclined, you can rest your awareness
in your heart and consciously send them your
love. (For more on opening your heart and
extending love, see Chapter 10.) You may find
that you enjoy hugging more — and that your
kids feel more loved and nurtured in the
process.

People who make love meditatively report greater responsiveness and more
intensely satisfying, whole-body orgasms. Men in particular say that they can
last longer, and women that they can reach orgasm more frequently. Perhaps
even more important, wholehearted, mindful awareness helps you infuse
more love into your lovemaking, allows you to connect more deeply with
your partner, and can actually transform sex into a spiritual experience.
Here are a few guidelines for making love in a meditative way. By all means,
share them with your partner if he or she is interested — but remember that
just applying them as much as possible yourself can improve the quality of
your sexual connection and may even entice your partner to follow your lead.
 Connect with the love between you. Before you make love, take a few
minutes or more to connect in a heartful, loving way. You may want to
gaze soulfully into one another’s eyes or give one another a nurturing
massage or whisper sweet words of love (or do the exercise in the side-
bar “Connecting more deeply with a partner or friend”) — whatever
helps you to drop your defenses and open your heart.
 See the Divine in your partner. In the traditional meditative sexual
practices of India and Tibet, the partners visualize one another as god
and goddess, the embodiment of the Divine masculine and feminine.
Maybe you’re not prepared to go quite so far, but you can certainly
reconnect with the feelings of reverence and devotion you felt for your
partner when you first fell in love.
 Be present — and come back when you drift off. After you’ve estab-
lished the connection between your genitals and your heart, you can
begin to touch one another lovingly, with as much awareness as you can
muster. When you start fantasizing or spacing out, gently return to the
present moment. If unresolved feelings such as resentment or hurt pre-
vent you from connecting wholeheartedly with your partner, don’t 
pretend — just stop and talk things through until you reconnect.
 Slow down and tune in. Notice any tendency you may have to switch to
automatic pilot, especially when the passion builds. Instead, slow down
the pace and tune in to the full range of your sensations, rather than just
focusing on your genitals. You’ll enjoy your lovemaking more, and you’ll
find that you have greater control over your energy. Be sure to tune in to
your partner as well — and feel free to ask your partner how he or she
wants to be touched.
 Remember to breathe. In the throes of passion, most people have a ten-
dency to hold their breath. Unfortunately, this response can suppress
your pleasure and hurry your climax (if you’re a man) or inhibit your
orgasm (if you’re a woman). Conscious, mindful breathing can ground
you in the present moment, relax your body, and deepen your enjoy-
ment immeasurably.
 When the energy starts to peak, stop for a few moments, breathe
together, and relax. This step may seem counterintuitive (most people
269
Chapter 15: How to Meditate in Everyday Life

tend to speed up when they get excited), but it’s actually the secret
doorway to a new world of sexual fulfillment. By letting go of your
active, goal-directed orientation and just relaxing and breathing
together, you deepen your heart connection and open yourselves to a
higher frequency of pleasure, akin to what the mystics call ecstasy.
When you feel your passion begin to wane, you can make love actively
again — but feel free to stop and breathe again when your energy peaks
and then return to active lovemaking.

Connecting more deeply with a partner or friend
If your partner knows how to meditate, you may
enjoy scheduling some regular time to practice
side by side. Then, if you feel adventurous and
want to connect more deeply, you can experi-
ment with the following exercise. (You can also
do it with a close friend, if you like.) If your part-
ner doesn’t meditate but is open to learning
how, this exercise can serve as an excellent
introduction:
1. Sit facing one another with your knees
close together. Place your hands in front of
you and join them with your partner’s —
right hands facing up, left hands facing
down.
2. Close your eyes, take a few deep breaths,
and relax as much as possible on the exha-
lation.
3. Attune yourself to your partner’s breathing
and gradually synchronize your inhalation
and exhalation with your partner’s.
In other words, start breathing in and out
together. Allow yourself to enjoy the deeper
harmony and connectedness this shared
rhythm evokes.
4. After several minutes, begin to alternate
your inhalations and exhalations.
Breathe out love or light or healing energy
and send it to your partner; breathe in the
love and energy he or she sends you and
take it into your heart. Continue this phase
of the exercise for as long you both feel
inclined. To intensify the connection, gaze
with soft focus into one another’s eyes and
allow the love to flow back and forth
through your gaze.
5. When you feel complete, imagine the 
love that you’ve generated between you
expanding to include everyone you love —
and ultimately enveloping and enlivening
all beings everywhere.
6. End the meditation by bowing to one
another or embracing.
You may want to follow up with a shared
massage or, if you’re lovers, a hot bath
or shower together or some meditative
lovemaking.

Chapter 15: How to Meditate in Everyday Life
Practicing a half smile
If you look closely at the classical statues of the
Buddha or at the faces of Renaissance madon-
nas, you’ll notice a half smile that signifies a
blend of tranquillity and joy. The Vietnamese
Buddhist teacher Thich Nhat Hanh suggests
that you can actually lift your mood and restore
your innate happiness by smiling consciously,
even when your spirits are low. “A tiny bud of a
smile on our lips nourishes awareness and
calms us miraculously,” he writes in Peace Is
Every Step. “It returns us to the peace we
thought we had lost.”
Contemporary scientific research agrees, indi-
cating that smiling relaxes muscles throughout
the body and has the same effect on the ner-
vous system as real joy. Besides, smiling
encourages others to smile and be happy.
Here are a few brief instructions for practic-
ing the half smile that Thich Nhat Hanh 
recommends:
1. Take a few moments right now to form your
lips into a half smile.
Notice how other parts of your body
respond. Does your belly relax? Does your
back naturally straighten a little? Does your
mood change in subtle ways? Notice also if
you have any resistance to smiling when
you “don’t really feel like it.”
2. Maintain this half smile for at least ten 
minutes.
Do you notice a shift in how you act or
respond to others? Do others respond to
your smile by smiling back?
3. The next time you feel your spirits sagging,
practice this half smile for half an hour and
notice how you feel.

f you practice the basic meditations taught elsewhere in this book (espe-
cially Chapter 6), you may begin to notice that your health gradually
improves (even if you think you’re already healthy), your energy and vitality
increase, and you find it easier and less stressful to do (and do effectively) the
things that used to stress you out. In fact, Western researchers have corrobo-
rated the findings of traditional healers and teachers that meditation has an
extraordinary capacity to help strengthen and heal your body and enhance
your performance by training your mind and opening your heart. (If you don’t
believe me, check out the research in Chapter 19, or the detailed list of medi-
tation’s benefits in Chapter 2.)
But what if you want to deal with a particular health problem, or transform
your tennis game, or put in a better showing at work? Does meditation have
some specialized techniques to offer? Sure it does! Healers both ancient and
modern have concocted some great meditations for facilitating the healing
process (which you get to sample in this chapter), and in recent years sports
gurus and corporate trainers have been applying the principles of meditation
to enhance performance both on the field and in the office.
I know I say somewhere else in this book that you shouldn’t be goal-oriented
when you meditate. Well, here you get to cheat a little and apply the skills
you picked up in earlier chapters — or if you haven’t read any other chap-
ters, you can pick them up here!

Meditation Has the Power to 
Help Heal Your Body, Too
The link between meditation and healing is a venerable one indeed. Take the
world’s great spiritual teachers — many were renowned for their healing 
abilities as well as their wisdom and compassion. Jesus, for example, first
revealed his spiritual maturity by helping the lame to walk and the blind to
see. The Jewish mystic known as the Baal Shem Tov had a reputation as a
miracle worker and healer, and the historical Buddha is traditionally likened
to a physician because the practices he taught help alleviate suffering. Even
the English language reflects the sacred dimension of healing: The word heal
derives from the same root as whole and holy!
Perhaps more important for ordinary folks like you and me, these teachers
passed down special meditation techniques that make it possible for practi-
tioners to influence their bodily functions to an extraordinary degree. Ever
hear about the yogis who stop their heart and live for hours without any
breathing or measurable metabolism? Or the Tibetan monks who generate so
much internal heat that they dry wet blankets on their bodies in subzero tem-
peratures? These people do exist — and their exceptional feats have been
measured by Western researchers.
In fact, the emerging field of mind-body medicine developed in the 1970s when
scientists studying the abilities of Eastern-trained meditators began to realize
that the mind can have an extraordinary effect on the body — or even more
precisely, that the body and the mind are inseparable. (Of course, the link
between type-A behavior and heart disease dates back even earlier, to the
1960s.) More recently, researchers studying immune response have shown that
the immune system and the nervous system are inextricably intertwined and
that psychological and emotional stress can suppress immune functioning and
encourage the growth or spread of immune-related disorders such as cancer,
AIDS, and autoimmune diseases. (For more on the mind-body connection and
the health benefits of meditation, see Chapter 2.)
These days, most physicians recognize the relevance of psychological factors
and the importance of relaxation and stress reduction in maintaining health.
There’s even a joke making the rounds of the medical field. Instead of offering
the old saw about aspirin, the contemporary mind-body physician advises:
“Take two meditations and call me in the morning.”
The good news is, you don’t have to control your heartbeat or your metabo-
lism to benefit from the healing power of meditation. You just have to sit still,
focus your mind, and practice some of the exercises provided in this section.
Of course, it helps to have some basic meditation experience — which you
can get by turning to Chapter 6 or listening to Track 4 on the CD — but you’re
welcome to begin here, if you’re strongly motivated, and learn as you go.
274
Part IV: Meditation in Action 

What healing really means
As I suggest at the start of this section, healing involves returning to an intrin-
sic state of wholeness and well-being, which our language, in its wisdom, links
with the sacred. Take a cold, for example. When you get better, you don’t end
up feeling like a different person — you just go back to being the way you
were before you got sick. That’s why people often say, when the cold goes
away, “I finally feel like myself again!”
Meditation by its very nature provides healing of the deepest kind. The disease
it helps heal is perhaps the most painful one of all — an epidemic human disor-
der known as separation (or, even worse, alienation) from our own being and
from other beings and things. (For more on this “disease,” see Chapter 2.)
When you meditate, you heal this separation by gradually reconnecting in the
here and now with your feelings, your sensate experience, and other aspects of
yourself you may have previously disowned. That is, you become more whole!
Most important, perhaps, you reconnect with your basic nature — pure being
itself — which is complete and perfect just the way it is. Stephen Levine,
whose numerous books have pioneered the use of meditation in healing, calls
this “the healing we took birth for.”
The more you reconnect with your essential wholeness and well-being, the
more you suffuse your body-mind with life energy and love. (As I mention in
Chapter 5, the wellspring of being inside you is the source of all positive, life-
affirming qualities and feelings.) And, as researchers have proven again and
again, this life-giving energy mobilizes your body’s healing resources, bol-
sters your immune system, and naturally facilitates the process of repair and
renewal. In other words, as you heal your separation, you contribute to the
healing of your body as well.
But even if you have some chronic ailment and can never heal your body
completely, you can still do the healing you were born to do. You don’t have
to consider yourself a failure if you don’t get well (as some alternative healing
approaches suggest you should). After all, you can encourage your healing
with meditation — but illness is a mysterious process you and I can’t really
understand. Who knows? You may be sick because you need to slow down,
reevaluate your priorities, and reconnect with yourself. Like few other life cir-
cumstances, illness can be a powerful messenger urging you to change your
life in significant ways.
How meditation heals
Besides overcoming separation, the basic meditation practices provided in
this book (especially Chapters 6 and 10) and on the accompanying CD con-
tribute to the healing process in a number of essential ways.
275
Chapter 16: Using Meditation for Healing and Performance Enhancement

Love and connectedness
As Dean Ornish, MD, reveals in his ground-breaking research (described
in Chapter 10), love is more important than any other factor in the healing
process, including diet and exercise. To heal your heart, he discovered, you
need to open your heart — and his findings have been corroborated in stud-
ies of cancer, AIDS, and other life-threatening illnesses. By putting you in
touch with the love in your heart (which, as I mention elsewhere, is not just
an emotion, but a direct expression of being itself), meditation nourishes not
only your internal organs but your entire body-mind organism.
Relief of tension and stress
By teaching you how to relax your body and calm your mind (see Chapter 6),
meditation helps you to avoid getting sick in the first place by alleviating
stress, a major cause of many ailments, from heart disease and stroke to gas-
trointestinal disorders and tension headaches. In particular, Jon Kabat-Zinn
(author of the bestseller Wherever You Go, There You Are) has developed a
stress-reduction program based on Buddhist mindfulness meditation that
teaches participants not only how to reduce stress while they’re meditating,
but also how to extend the benefits of mindfulness to every area of their
lives. (For a more complete description of Kabat-Zinn’s work, see Chapter 2.
For research into the benefits of the approach he teaches, see Chapter 19.)
Restoring alignment and balance
Traditional healing practices such as ayurveda (the traditional medicine of
India involving herbs and diet) and Chinese medicine, as well as more main-
stream approaches like chiropractic and osteopathy, suggest that the body
gets sick when it becomes unbalanced or misaligned. Meditation slows the
mind to the speed of the breath, which restores balance and harmony to the
body and facilitates healing. Besides, sitting up straight (see Chapter 7) aligns
the spine and encourages the unimpeded flow of life-giving energy through
the body, which promotes both physical and psychological well-being.
Opening and softening
If you’re like many people, you tend to get impatient or upset with yourself
when you’re sick or hurting. You may even have strong judgments, as though
it’s a bad or blameworthy thing to be ill. Unfortunately, these negative emo-
tions may compound your suffering — and even amplify your illness — by
causing you to tense up and contract. When you meditate regularly, you
develop the skill of opening to your experience, however unpleasant, and
softening around it instead of judging it or pushing it away.
Creating space for all your emotions
As you accept your experience in meditation, you create a welcoming envi-
ronment in which your feelings can bubble up and release, rather than be
276
Part IV: Meditation in Action 

suppressed or acted out. (For more on meditating with emotions, see
Chapter 11.) Research suggests that unexpressed feelings locked in the body
form focal points of tension and stress that may eventually contribute to the
development of life-threatening illnesses such as cancer and heart disease.
Besides, you naturally feel more enlivened — and therefore more healthy —
when you can feel your feelings fully.
Harmony, joy, and well-being
Positive qualities like happiness, joy, peace, and well-being don’t originate
outside you, in some other person or thing. Instead, they well up inside you
naturally and spontaneously, like water bubbling up from a spring — you
simply have to create the right internal environment, as you do when you
meditate. (Of course, you can always cultivate positive emotions like love
and compassion, as I describe on the CD and in Chapter 10.) Western
researchers have shown that these positive qualities correlate with a host of
life-enhancing bodily responses, from lowered blood pressure and improved
immune response to the release of natural painkillers called beta-endorphins.
(For more on the health benefits of meditation, see Chapter 2.) As the New
Jerusalem Bible puts it, “Gladness of heart is life to anyone; joy is what gives
length of days” (Eccles. 30:5).
Freedom from self-clinging and habitual patterns
Ultimately, it’s the illusion (which we all share) of being a separate, isolated
individual cut off from others and the rest of life that lies at the heart of all
suffering and stress. According to the Tibetan scholar and meditation master
Tulku Thondup, author of The Healing Power of Mind, “living in peace, free
from emotional afflictions, and loosening our grip on ‘self’ is the ultimate
medicine for both mental and physical health.” As you gradually begin to
penetrate and let go of habitual patterns (which have deep roots in the body
as well as the mind), you become less emotionally reactive (which reduces
stress) and more positively (even joyfully) responsive to life as it unfolds.
(For more on working with habitual patterns, see Chapter 11.)
Awakening to a spiritual dimension
Herbert Benson, MD, a professor at Harvard Medical School, developed the
technique known as the Relaxation Response (see Chapter 2) on the basis of
studies of people who repeated a simple word or phrase, known as a mantra.
But over the years, he discovered that the more meaningful the mantra, the
more effective the technique in relaxing the body and promoting healing. “If
you truly believe in your personal philosophy or religious faith,” he reported
in Beyond the Relaxation Response, “you may well be capable of achieving
remarkable feats of mind and body that [we] may only speculate about.” In
other words, you enhance the healing powers of meditation when you
expand your awareness to include a spiritual dimension of being.

Part IV: Meditation in Action 
Meditation at the edge of life
Many teachers have written about the power-
ful role meditation can play in helping people
bridge the chasm between life and death. In
fact, some traditions, like Zen Buddhism, teach
that one of the primary purposes of meditation
practice is to prepare you for the ultimate 
transition.
Certainly, most traditions would agree that how
you live helps to determine how you die. (For
example, if you tend to be fearful or angry in life,
then you’re likely to be fearful or angry at death.
And if you tend to be calm or loving or joyful,
then these qualities will probably fill your being
when you die as well.) And many traditions
believe that the moment of death itself can be a
crucial factor in determining what happens
next. (Of course, they tend to part company
when it comes to describing what the next step
might be!)
If you’re concerned about the way you may die,
you can prepare for death by using meditation
to help you bring more peace and harmony into
your life right now. In addition, the meditations
presented throughout this book teach skills that
will definitely come in handy when you
approach the threshold between life and death.
Here are a few of the ways that meditation can
help you (and those you love) die a more loving,
conscious death. (Remember: Meditation may
help make death more comfortable and less
frightening, but there’s no right or wrong way to
do it. Everyone lives and dies in his or her own
unique way.)
 Staying present: Needless to say, fear,
regret, and other negative feelings may get
magnified a thousand fold when you
approach the ultimate unknown. By bring-
ing your awareness back to your breath or
some other object, you can help calm your
mind and keep it from spiraling down into
negativity.
 Welcoming whatever arises: The weeks,
days, and moments leading up to death may
be filled with painful sensations and difficult
emotions and mind-states. When you’ve
developed the capacity through meditation
to be with your experience, whatever it may
be, you’re better prepared for this challeng-
ing time.
 Opening your heart: If you practice opening
your heart to yourself and others (see
Chapter 10), you’ll be ready to access the
love when you need it — and when could
you possibly need it more? Many traditions
teach that love helps bridge the chasm
between this life and the next. Besides,
people who die in love bestow the immea-
surable legacy of love on those they leave
behind.
 Letting go: When you keep returning to your
breath or some other object of meditation,
you become accustomed to letting go of
your thoughts, emotions, preoccupations,
likes, and dislikes — and ultimately, per-
haps, even letting go of who you think you
are. In Zen, they say that when you become
adept at dying this way on your meditation
cushion, the real death poses no problem at
all. Or, as Stephen Levine puts it in Healing
into Life and Death, “To let go of the last
moment and enter wholeheartedly the next
is to die into life, is to heal into death.”
 Trusting the deathless: As you deepen your
connection with being (as opposed to think-
ing or doing) through the practice of medi-
tation, you may awaken to a spiritual or

The healing power of imagery
In her book Staying Well with Guided Imagery, psychotherapist and guided-
imagery pioneer Belleruth Naparstek cites extensive research that estab-
lishes three basic principles behind the healing power of imagery. These
principles help explain the effectiveness of the meditations provided in this
chapter, which use imagery extensively. (Incidentally, imagery may or may
not involve visual images; if you’re more kinesthetic or auditory, for example,
you may hear or feel the “images,” rather than see them.)
 Your body responds to sensory images as though they were real. If
you’re not sure what I mean, just recall the last time you had a sexual
fantasy or reminisced about a vacation and had all the emotions and
sensations of the actual event. In one study cited in Naparstek’s book,
for example, 84 percent of subjects exposed to poison ivy had no reac-
tion when, under hypnosis, they imagined the plant to be harmless. In
other words, their bodies believed the images their minds evoked and
didn’t break out in a rash! Other studies have shown that patients can
use positive imagery to measurably increase the numbers of immune
response cells in their bloodstream.
 In the meditative state, you can heal, change, learn, and grow more
rapidly. Naparstek uses the term altered state, which refers (in her
usage) to a calm, relaxed, but focused state of mind — precisely the
state you cultivate in meditation. This principle also applies to problem-
solving and performance enhancement: You can explore new behaviors,
279
Chapter 16: Using Meditation for Healing and Performance Enhancement
sacred dimension that infuses this life with
meaning but at the same time transcends it.
Whether you call this dimension true self or
essential nature, God or spirit, or simply the
One, you now know (rather than simply
believe) that something far greater than
your separate existence informs your life
and survives your death. As you can imag-
ine, this realization makes death far easier
to face.
Besides preparing you to meet your own
demise, meditation can teach you how to be a
source of support for your loved ones and
friends as they approach death. Just apply the
principles listed here to the time you spend with
them, either by sharing what you’ve discovered
in your meditation (if they’re open to hearing it)
or by being present with them with as much
love, awareness, trust, openness, and letting go
as you can muster. (You can also ease their let-
ting go by practicing the “Ahh breath” with
them. To find out more about meditation and the
process of dying, read Healing into Life and
Death by Stephen Levine or The Tibetan Book
of Living and Dying by Sogyal Rinpoche.)

improve existing ones, and make tactical breakthroughs far more easily
in a meditative state than you can in your ordinary frame of mind. (For
more on meditation for performance enhancement, see the section
“Meditation Can Enhance Your Performance at Work and Play” later in
this chapter.)
 Imagery gives you a sense of mastery in challenging circumstances,
which reduces your stress and bolsters your self-esteem. When you’re
struggling with a health problem or a difficult assignment at work, you
may feel flustered and helpless if you believe you can’t do anything to
control the outcome. But if you know that you can use imagery to help
your body heal or enhance your performance, you can regain your confi-
dence and your hope in the future. Numerous studies have shown that
people feel better and perform more effectively when they believe they
have some control over their lives.
In addition to these principles, Naparstek adds that emotion amplifies the
power of imagery. When you allow yourself to feel the images intensely as
well as experiencing them fully in all your senses, you give them more power
to heal and transform you.
Six healing meditations
As I mention at the beginning of this chapter, you don’t have to do any spe-
cial exercises to enjoy the health benefits of meditation — just develop a con-
sistent practice based on the instructions provided elsewhere in this book
(and on the CD as well). But if you’re struggling with a chronic health prob-
lem (or just want to improve your overall state of health), you may want to
experiment with one or more of the meditations that follow. You can add
them to your regular practice or do them exclusively for a period of time.
With one exception, they use guided imagery to help you relax your body,
reduce your stress, ease your suffering, enhance your sense of self-mastery,
and mobilize your healing resources. (To find out more about how to use
meditation to facilitate healing, read Healing into Life and Death by Stephen
Levine or The Healing Power of Mind by Tulku Thondup.)
Peaceful place
Because this meditation relaxes the body quickly and easily, you can use it by
itself to help facilitate healing, or you can practice it as a preliminary exercise
before the other healing visualizations provided in this section. For detailed
audio instructions, turn to Track 12 on your CD.
1. Begin by sitting comfortably, closing your eyes, and taking a few deep
breaths.
2. Imagine yourself in a safe, protected, peaceful place.
280
Part IV: Meditation in Action 

It may be a place you know well (a place in nature, for example, such as
a meadow, a forest, or a beach), a place you’ve visited once or twice
before, or simply a place in your imagination.
3. Take as much time as you need to imagine this peaceful place as
vividly as you can, in all your senses.
Notice the colors, the shapes, the sounds, the light, the feeling of the air
against your skin, the contact of your feet against the ground. Explore
this special place to your heart’s content.
4. Allow yourself to rest in the feelings of comfort, safety, and tranquility
this special place evokes.
5. Spend as much time here as you want.
When you’re done, gradually return to the present moment and open
your eyes, while continuing to enjoy the pleasant, positive feelings.
Inner smile
By smiling into your internal organs, you can infuse them with the healing
energy of love. “In ancient China, the Taoists taught that a constant inner
smile, a smile to oneself, insured health, happiness, and longevity,” writes
Mantak Chia in his book Awakening Healing Energy through the Tao. “Smiling
to yourself is like basking in love: you become your own best friend.” Try the
following meditation, which is adapted from Chia’s book.
1. Begin by closing your eyes, forming a half smile with your lips, and
smiling into your eyes.
Feel the smile shine through your eyes. Taoists believe that relaxing the
eyes calms the entire nervous system.
2. When you feel your eyes filled with the vibrant energy of your smile,
you can begin to send this energy down through your body.
If you’re not sure how to “send energy,” don’t worry. Just imagine the
energy moving, and it will! (Incidentally, the Taoists call this energy chi,
as in the well-known martial arts t’ai chi and chi kung, and equate it with
the life force.)
3. Smile down into your jaw and tongue.
Like most people, you probably hold tension in your jaw — and when
your jaw relaxes, you may notice your whole body relaxing as well.
4. Smile into your neck and throat and dissolve any tension there.
5. Let the relaxing energy of your smile flow down into your heart, fill-
ing it with love.
281
Chapter 16: Using Meditation for Healing and Performance Enhancement

6. From your heart, allow the love to flow into your other internal
organs in the following order, relaxing, softening, and rejuvenating
them as it moves:
• Lungs
• Liver (beneath your ribcage on the right side)
• Kidneys (just below the ribcage in back, on either side of the
spine)
• Pancreas and spleen (in the center of your abdomen)

Working with pain
Like death, pain is a complex topic that defi-
nitely deserves a chapter (or even a book) of its
own. Most of us never simply experience phys-
ical pain just the way it is — a set of intense
physical sensations. Instead, we tend to react
to our pain — to tighten and contract around it,
to struggle to get rid of it — and weave a story
about it that we superimpose on the experience:
“Why me? What did I do to deserve it?” or “I
can’t stand it. I won’t be able to make it
through.” In the process, we prolong our pain
and turn it into suffering. (For more on the dif-
ference between pain and suffering, see
Chapter 5.)
The secret to coping with pain is to soften
around it, rather than resist it, and to expand
your awareness (and your heart) to include it,
rather than tighten and contract. After all, if you
can’t actually get rid of the pain or block it out
of your mind, you may as well welcome it — and
even (dare I say) make friends with it. But you
can’t do this readily without considerable prac-
tice, which is why the meditations taught
throughout this book provide the best prepara-
tion for working with pain. (You might begin with
deep relaxation as described in Chapter 6. For
more suggestions on dealing with pain, see
Chapter 7.)
You can begin by opening and softening in rela-
tion to the small aches and pains you experi-
ence when you sit in meditation and gradually
work up to the larger pains, such as a bad
headache, a sore throat, or a back spasm.
You can also do the moment-to-moment work of
challenging the story your mind keeps telling
you and returning to the bare sensation of the
pain itself — which is inevitably more bearable
than the worst-case scenario your mind fabri-
cates. In his book Full Catastrophe Living, Jon
Kabat-Zinn, who works with people in chronic
pain at the Stress-Reduction Clinic at the
University of Massachusetts Medical Center,
suggests going directly into the sensations of
the pain and asking yourself the question, “How
bad is it right now, in this very moment?” Most
of the time, he counsels, you’ll find that the pain
is tolerable after all.
Intense pain also has a tendency to flush out the
unresolved issues and unfelt emotions of a life-
time, so don’t be surprised if you need to turn to
Chapter 11 for some guidance on how to work
with difficult mind-states. Ultimately, pain can
be a powerful teacher, forcing you to deepen
your meditation and open to the present
moment as never before.

When you finish sending love to these organs, rest your smile in your
t’an t’ien (a point about 2 inches below your navel and about 11⁄2 inches
inside your body).
7. Smile again into your eyes and then into your mouth.
8. Gather some saliva, swallow it, and allow your smile to follow it
through your digestive system, spreading relaxation into your esopha-
gus, stomach, small intestines, and colon.
9. Once again return your smile to your eyes and smile down the center
of your spine, one vertebra at a time, until you reach your tailbone.
Be sure to have your back straight as you do this exercise.
10. When you finish with your spine, rest your smile in your t’an t’ien
again and notice how your body feels now.
Rest in this feeling for a few minutes before resuming your normal activi-
ties. When you get the knack of this exercise, you can do it in just a few
minutes, if you want.
Good medicine
If you have an illness that requires you to take medication, you may find
yourself swallowing the pills with a certain distaste, a certain judgment or
aversion to being sick in the first place, as though you were somehow flawed
or at fault for allowing your body to suffer. When you take your pills (or your
injection or surgery) with awareness, you can send love to your body along
with the remedy and contribute immeasurably to its healing effect. (Even if
you’re not sick, you can take your vitamins or herbs with the same attitude.)
The Sioux know this well: They call any act of love “good medicine.” (The fol-
lowing meditation is adapted from the book Healing into Life and Death by
Stephen Levine.)
1. Begin by closing your eyes and holding the pills in your hand for a
few moments.
Notice how they feel — their weight, their texture.
2. Consider that these pills have the power to help your body heal.
You may even feel some gratitude welling up in your heart. You are one
of the fortunate ones: You have access to medical care, and you have a
health professional who prescribed these pills for you.
3. Notice whether you feel any resistance to taking these pills — any
fear, shame, or self-blame.
Allow these feelings to arise in your awareness, and meet them with
kindness and compassion.
4. Relax and soften your body as you prepare to receive these pills.
283
Chapter 16: Using Meditation for Healing and Performance Enhancement

5. Gently and with awareness, put the pills into your mouth and wash
them down with liquid.
Feel them moving down your throat into your stomach and radiating
their healing potential there like the glow of a warm fire. Open your body
to receive them.
6. Imagine the medicine entering your bloodstream and reaching the
parts that cry out for healing.
Send love and compassion to these parts along with the medicine.
7. Feel the love and the medicine suffusing and healing these parts.
Imagine all disease and resistance dissolving. Let yourself be healed.
8. Continue to sit quietly for a few minutes as you allow the medicine
and the love to help you heal.
Healing with light
Just as you can help to purify and eliminate habitual patterns by invoking the
power of spiritual beings or energies (see Chapter 11), you can access the
same source of power and light to help your body heal. After all, physical 
illness and emotional suffering are just different facets of the same basic
problem — just different ways you contract away from your essential whole-
ness and health. Here’s an exercise for directing the light to the places inside
your body that cry out for healing.
1. Begin by sitting down and meditating in your usual way for several
minutes.
If you don’t have a usual way, you can find one in Chapter 6 — or just sit
quietly, take a few deep breaths, and allow your body to relax a little on
each exhalation.
2. Imagine a sphere of white light suspended about a foot above your
head and slightly in front of you.
As you look more closely, you may notice that this sphere takes the form
of a being who embodies all the positive, healing energy you need.
Perhaps it’s a spiritual figure, like Jesus or Mother Mary or the Dalai
Lama, or possibly it’s a being or object from nature, such as the sun, the
moon, the wind, the ocean, a tree, a flower, or a mountain.
3. Imagine this sphere radiating light in all directions to the farthest cor-
ners of the universe.
As it does so, it draws the energy of all the benevolent forces that sup-
port your healing back into the sphere.
4. Imagine this positive, healing energy shining from the sphere like the
light of a thousand suns streaming down through your body.
284
Part IV: Meditation in Action 

Imagine the light eliminating all toxicity and stress, all disharmony and
disease, and replacing them with radiance, vitality, and health. In partic-
ular, you can imagine directing this light like a beacon to all the places
you know to be involved in your illness or distress. Imagine the light dis-
solving any contractions, replacing them with openness and ease, and
flooding any weakness with power and strength.
5. Continue to imagine this powerful, healing light infusing every cell
and molecule of your being, leaving you healthy, peaceful, and strong.
6. Imagine this luminous sphere gradually descending into your heart,
where it continues to radiate this powerful, healing light.
7. Imagine yourself as a luminous being with a sphere of light in your
heart that constantly radiates health, harmony, peace, and vitality —
first to every cell and particle of your own being and then, through
you, to every other being in every direction.
You can carry the feeling of vitality and strength that this exercise
evokes throughout the rest of your day.
Ahhh breath
If you’re looking for a way to support a loved one in his or her healing
process, beyond buying flowers, cooking a meal, or helping with chores, you
might try this partner meditation, drawn from the work of Stephen Levine,
whose many books have helped thousands of people to live (and die) with
greater love and awareness. In Healing into Life and Death, he writes: “This is
one of the simplest and most powerful exercises we know to give confidence
that the ever-healed is never far away — to sense the heart we all share, the
one mind of being.” You can also use it to bring greater intimacy to your rela-
tionships with parents, children, partners, and friends. (If the other person
feels up to it, take some time to receive the ahhh breath as well as give it.)
1. Before you begin, describe the exercise to your partner and make
sure she feels comfortable doing it with you.
Let her know that she can end it at any time by simply raising her arm.
2. Begin by having the person receiving the ahhh breath lie down on the
floor or a bed.
You sit at her side, near her torso but not touching her.
3. Encourage the other person to relax and breathe comfortably while
you observe the coming and going of her breath.
Now drop all verbal communication until the exercise is over.
4. Begin to synchronize your breath with her breath.
When she inhales, you inhale. When she exhales, you exhale. Remain
attuned to the ever-changing rhythm of her breath and adjust your own
rhythm accordingly.
285
Chapter 16: Using Meditation for Healing and Performance Enhancement

5. After eight or ten breaths breathed in this way, start making the
sound ahhh on the exhalation, softly and gently but audibly.
With each repetition, allow the sound to come from an even deeper
place in your body until the ahhh originates in the bottom of your belly.
Inhale together in silence, then intone ahhh on the exhale. (Your partner
doesn’t have to repeat the sound.)
6. Continue this shared meditation for as long as you both feel 
comfortable.
When you’re done, take some time to talk with your partner about your
experiences. This shared practice may elicit any number of responses.
Some people relax more deeply than ever before. Others notice some fear
of letting go or getting so close to another person. Still others glimpse a
deep peace beneath all the usual turmoil and concern. Whatever you or
your partner experience, you can welcome it (as much as possible) with
openness and nonjudgmental acceptance.
Great Mother
Many meditative traditions feature an archetypal feminine figure who nur-
tures and heals and carries the pain of others. In the Christian tradition, she’s
Mary, mother of sorrows. In Buddhism, she’s called Kuan Yin, who hears and
responds to the cries of the world. Patterned after the good mother who
loves her children unconditionally, the Great Mother can be invoked in what-
ever form feels most comfortable for you. She has the capacity to ease your
pain with her compassion and to help you heal into wholeness.
1. Begin by sitting comfortably, closing your eyes, and taking a few deep
breaths, relaxing a little with each exhalation.
Allow your belly to soften.
2. Bring your attention to your heart and notice any pain or suffering
you may be holding there.
Gently breathe with awareness into this painful place in your heart.
3. Imagine the presence of an infinitely compassionate feminine figure —
the Great Mother.
Feel her arms surrounding you and holding you in her warm, supportive,
nurturing embrace. You can let go completely and relax into her arms.
No need to hold yourself up anymore.
4. With each inhalation, breathe her love into your heart in the form of
warm, liquid light.
With each exhalation, breathe out all your suffering and disease in the
form of black soot, which she naturally receives and transforms into
light.
286
Part IV: Meditation in Action 

5. If you feel moved to share your pain with her in the form of words or
tears, go ahead.
Her infinite heart is filled with compassion; she welcomes your suffering
as though it were her own.
6. Continue to surrender yourself into her arms and receive her love
into your heart as you let go of your suffering and sorrow.
With each breath, you feel more complete, more whole, more healed.
Gradually, you feel your own heart dissolve into hers.
7. Spend as much time as you need in the presence of the Great Mother.
When you’re done, imagine her entering you and filling you with her pres-
ence. You are the Great Mother (whether you’re a man or a woman) —
her heart is your heart. From this heart, you can radiate out the warm
light of compassion and healing to all beings everywhere. May all beings
be happy, peaceful, and free from suffering.
Meditation Can Enhance Your Performance
at Work and Play
For many of the same reasons that meditation helps to facilitate healing, it
also enhances performance. It relaxes your body and reduces stress and anxi-
ety, which allows you to function more effectively. It promotes positive mind-
states, such as love, joy, and well-being, and encourages the flow of life-energy
287
Chapter 16: Using Meditation for Healing and Performance Enhancement
Making Great Waves
As I was thumbing through an old Zen text, I
came across a true story that exemplifies the
power of meditation for performance enhance-
ment. It seems that a sumo wrestler named
Great Waves was so powerful and adept that 
he could defeat even his teacher, but in public
he lost both his confidence and his matches. 
He decided to seek out a local Zen master for
guidance.
After listening to the wrestler’s story, the master
told him to spend the night in the temple in 
meditation, imagining himself to be the “great
waves” of his name. “Imagine sweeping every-
thing before you with your power,” advised the
master. “Then you will be the great wrestler you
were destined to be.”
Throughout the night, Great Waves focused his
attention on the image of the powerful water.
Gradually, his mind became one-pointed, and by
morning he had become the indomitable ocean
itself. From then on, the story concludes, no one
in all of Japan could defeat him.

through the body, which in turn promotes self-confidence and a sense of power
and effectiveness. And it awakens a deeper connection with a source of mean-
ing and purpose, which inspires and uplifts you in whatever you do.
Meditation also teaches you how to cultivate certain other qualities and skills
that naturally contribute to making you better at your favorite endeavor,
whether it’s sports or business, gardening or studying, or simply washing the
dishes or sweeping the floor. Here’s a brief list — if you think of any more,
just let me know:
 Increased focus and concentration: This one’s a no-brainer: As you
become adept at staying on task as you follow your breaths or recite
your mantra, you can easily transfer this skill to working at your com-
puter or playing ball with friends. For the benefits of focus, just look at
great athletes like Tiger Woods, Lance Armstrong, or Annika Sorenstam!
 Minimal distractions: This little benefit is the flip side of the preceding
one: The more regularly you meditate, the more quickly distractions fade
into the background as your mind settles down and becomes one-pointed.
Needless to say, you work or play more effectively without a million irrele-
vant thoughts chattering away inside your head. As Yogi Berra once said
about baseball, “How can you think and hit at the same time?”
 Being in the moment, free from expectations: Even though you may have
a particular goal in mind — for example, winning the race, completing the
project, landing the ball in a tiny cup 300 yards away — the paradox is
that you’re more likely to succeed if you set aside your expectations and
keep your attention focused on the precise movements or tasks you need
to execute right now. Former Los Angeles Lakers coach Phil Jackson calls
it “trusting the moment.”
 Enhanced mental and perceptual clarity: One of the fortuitous side
effects of keeping your mind on the moment is that your senses become
sharper and your mind quicker and more attuned to subtle details —
which, needless to say, comes in quite handy when you’re trying to do
something well.
 Greater endurance and longer attention span: As you gradually increase
the length of your meditations from 10 to 15 to 20 minutes or more, you
gradually build your power to pay attention longer. As a result, you may
find that you don’t get so easily burned out or discouraged when you turn
your attention to an extended work project or other demanding activity.
 Flow experience: In sports they call it “the zone”: moments or extended
periods when you feel totally in synch with your body and your surround-
ings. Time seems to slow down, feelings of well-being and enjoyment
increase, you see everything clearly as (or even before) it transpires, and
you know exactly what you need to do next. By cultivating your powers of
concentration in meditation, you develop the ability to enter the flow
more easily in every situation. (For more on flow, see Chapter 1.)
288
Part IV: Meditation in Action 

 The capacity to see things multidimensionally: In meditation, you prac-
tice witnessing or observing your experience without getting lost in the
details. This more expanded, global awareness naturally allows you to
step back and see the whole picture, which can be extraordinarily useful
when you’re trying to solve a problem or scope out the opposing team
(in sports or business) or just evaluate and improve your performance.
Some great athletes even report that they can see the whole game as
though from above when they’re playing.
 Mindfulness of self-defeating behaviors: When you expand your aware-
ness in your meditation to include sensations and mental processes, you
begin to notice repetitive patterns of thinking and feeling that cause you
stress or inhibit your full self-expression (see Chapter 12). By extending
this mindfulness to your performance (at work or play), you can catch
self-defeating patterns and replace them with more productive, effective
alternatives.
 Self-acceptance and freedom from self-criticism: Nothing dampens
enthusiasm and inhibits effective performance more than the tendency
most of us have to put ourselves down, especially under pressure.
Through regular meditation, you practice accepting yourself the way
you are and noticing the judgments as they arise. Then, when the going
gets tough, you can use your meditation skills to gently defuse the self-
criticism as you focus on doing your personal best.
 Compassion and teamwork: In his best-selling book Sacred Hoops, Phil
Jackson describes how he forged a world-champion basketball team
based on the principles and lessons he learned in his study of Zen medi-
tation. In addition to focus, mindfulness, and the other factors listed
here, Jackson emphasizes the role of compassion (which can be deliber-
ately cultivated in meditation; see Chapter 10). “As my [meditation]
practice matured,” he writes, “I began to appreciate the importance of
playing with an open heart. Love is the force that ignites the spirit and
binds teams together.”
Besides the benefits of a regular meditation practice listed here, you can also
do meditations that are specifically designed to improve performance. In par-
ticular, you can use guided imagery to help you create a positive mind-state
and rehearse performances before they occur. (For more on guided imagery,
see the section “The healing power of imagery” earlier in this chapter.) In her
book Staying Well with Guided Imagery, Belleruth Naparstek calls the first kind
of guided imagery feeling-state imagery and the second end-state imagery. (In
the sidebar “Making Great Waves” earlier in this chapter, the sumo wrestler
uses a third, called metaphoric imagery, which actually incorporates elements
of the other two.)
You’ve no doubt read about the Olympic and professional athletes who use
both feeling and end-state imagery in their training regimen. In the following
two sections, you have an opportunity to practice first a generic feeling-state
performance meditation and then a meditation designed to help you execute
your performance successfully.

Enjoying past success
Here’s a meditation that will relax your body, lift your spirits, and put you in a
positive frame of mind for an upcoming performance. If possible, begin prac-
ticing it several days or a week or more before the performance so that you
have ample time to prepare.
1. Begin by doing the “Peaceful place” meditation described earlier in
this chapter.
Or you can just sit comfortably, close your eyes, and take a few deep
breaths, relaxing a little on each exhalation. Spend several minutes
breathing and relaxing in this way.
290
Part IV: Meditation in Action 
Encouraging your creativity
Creative people often report that they enter an
altered or meditative state when they envision
or create. Meditation naturally feeds creativity
by helping you to bypass your analytical mind
and tap into a deeper wellspring of energy, vital-
ity, and intuition. Ideas and images may sponta-
neously bubble up in meditation as though from
some collective source.
In addition to doing the basic meditations pro-
vided elsewhere in this book, you can encourage
your creative juices to flow with a meditation
called the “morning pages,” adapted from the
book The Artist’s Way by Julia Cameron. It’s
designed to engage what Cameron calls “artist-
brain” — the playful, creative, holistic part of
your mind — and evade the “Censor,” the inner
critic who dampens or even ridicules your cre-
ative impulses.
The meditation itself is actually quite simple:
First thing every morning, preferably right after
you roll out of bed, sit down and write by hand
three pages of whatever comes into your mind.
It doesn’t have to be good or grammatical; it
doesn’t even have to make sense — it just has
to fill three pages. By writing without double-
checking or trying to be logical or smart, you’re
bypassing the Censor, while clearing your brain
of all the cobwebs that accumulated overnight.
You’re also showing yourself that you don’t have
to feel good or be in a great mood to create. You
can scribble down complaints or dreams or
things you need to do, whatever — you can’t do
it wrong. Just write!
Cameron does suggest a few guidelines for get-
ting the most out of your morning pages:
 Do them every day without fail. You can
decide in advance how many weeks you’re
going to do them, and then follow through
on your intention. Like meditation itself, the
morning pages may become a habit you
don’t want to break.
 Don’t show them to anyone else — and
don’t read them yourself for the first few
weeks at least. Cameron actually suggests
not reading them for the first eight weeks,
but don’t be too concerned if curiosity over-
takes you.
 Remember that the negative opinions of
your Censor aren’t true. You can include
your Censor’s judgments in your morning
pages, if you like — but don’t believe them!

2. Recall a time when you successfully completed the same or a similar
performance.
If you’ve never done anything like this before, just remember a time
when you did something especially well and successfully.
3. Take some time to remember this successful performance as vividly
and with as much sensory detail as you possibly can.
Where were you? What were you wearing? What exactly were you doing?
How did your body feel? Who else was there? What kinds of feelings did
this successful performance evoke?
4. When you’re fully immersed in the memory and your positive 
feelings reach their peak, find a physical gesture that underscores
these feelings.
For example, you might touch two fingers together or rest your hand on
your belly.
5. Gradually let go of the memory, return to ordinary consciousness,
and open your eyes.
6. Practice this meditation several times between now and the actual
performance, each time repeating the physical gesture.
7. As you begin the actual performance, close your eyes for a moment
and repeat the physical gesture.
You’ll be amazed to discover that the positive feelings return in a flash.
Rehearsing peak performance
It’s one thing to be in a positive frame of mind when you perform, but quite
another to know exactly what you’re doing. When you’re feeling relaxed, you
can apply the principles of meditation to fine-tune your performance before-
hand so you’re peaking when you step up to the proverbial plate.
Here’s a meditation similar to the exercises athletes use. To quote Jack
Nicklaus from his book Golf My Way: “I never hit a shot, not even in practice,
without a very sharp, in-focus picture of it in my head.” Again, be sure to give
yourself plenty of time to practice before the actual performance.
1. Begin by doing the “Peaceful place” meditation described earlier in
this chapter.
Or you can just sit comfortably, close your eyes, and take a few deep
breaths, relaxing a little on each exhalation. Spend several minutes
breathing and relaxing in this way.
291
Chapter 16: Using Meditation for Healing and Performance Enhancement

2. Imagine yourself executing your performance perfectly from begin-
ning to end.
Imagine it as vividly and with as much sensory detail as you possibly
can. If you’re rehearsing a tennis match, for example, feel the racket in
your hand and your shoes against the court; feel your arm lifting, reach-
ing back, and arcing forward as you serve; feel the contact of the ball
against the racket; and so on.
Studies have shown that kinesthetic rehearsals (in which you feel your
body going through the motions) are nearly as effective as actual prac-
tice in improving performance in sports and other physical activities. If
you’re rehearsing a presentation at work, imagine standing in front of
the group, speaking articulately and cogently, getting the important
points across, and so on.
3. Include a feeling-state dimension by noticing how good you feel as
you move through the performance.
You may feel exhilaration, excitement, power, or enjoyment. If you notice
any fear or apprehension, just pause for a moment, take a few deep
breaths, do whatever you usually do to allay your fear, and then resume
your rehearsal.
292
Part IV: Meditation in Action 
Enjoying the dance of yes
Take ten minutes to notice the subtle (and not-
so-subtle) ways your mind keeps saying no to
life — suppressing your feelings and impulses,
judging or even rejecting other people, refusing
to accept the way things actually are. For exam-
ple, you may feel sadness arising but push it
away and refuse to feel it. Or you may look in the
mirror but edit what you see, either by criticizing
yourself for your appearance or refusing to see
your imperfections. Or perhaps you close your
heart to your loved ones because they don’t live
up to your expectations.
You may be amazed to discover how much
energy your mind consumes by refusing to
accept what’s actually happening right in front
of you.
Instead, for the next ten minutes, just say yes.
Whatever you experience, whomever you meet,
however life presents itself to you, notice your
tendency to resist or deny and instead say yes.
Yes to your feelings, yes to your partner or your
kids, yes to your body and your face, yes to your
life. As much as possible, keep an open, spa-
cious, attentive mind. Of course, you’re wel-
come to change what you don’t like, but take a
moment to say yes to it first.
You may be so accustomed to saying no that
you don’t know how to say yes at first. So feel
free to experiment. Repeating the word yes to
yourself can help get you started. Maybe you’ll
end up enjoying the dance of yes so much that
you extend it to every area of your life. Yes, 
yes, yes!

4. Take as much time as you need to imagine yourself executing the per-
formance perfectly.
If you notice any mistakes, stop and correct them and then repeat the
performance correctly. At first, your rehearsal may take as long as the
actual performance. After you’ve clarified all the details, you can abbre-
viate subsequent rehearsals if you have only limited time.
5. Be sure to practice this exercise at least several times before the
actual performance.
Immediately before the performance, stop for a moment, close your
eyes, and run through an abbreviated rehearsal.

W
hen most folks first consider taking up the practice of meditation, they
usually have a few questions they need to have answered — and when
they get started, they come up with a few more. Well, here are some brief
answers to ten of the most popular questions. For more detailed answers,
check out the rest of this book.
Will Meditation Make Me Too Relaxed 
or Spaced Out to Succeed 
at Work or School?
Many people still associate meditation with impractical alternative lifestyles
and fear they may get morphed into a hippie or a navel-gazing yogi if they dare
to sit quietly for a few minutes. The truth is, meditation actually teaches you
how to focus your mind and minimize distractions so you can get things done
more effectively. Besides, when you’re tense, you can’t do anything particularly
well — and meditation helps you relax your body and reduce your stress so
you can make better (and more enjoyable) use of your time.

As I explain in more detail in Chapter 1, most meditation practices are a blend
of concentration and receptive awareness. With concentration, you discover
how to stabilize your attention on a particular object, such as your breath or
some other bodily sensation. Eventually, you can extend this concentration
to work or sports or any other activity. In fact, psychologists have a word for
the total absorption that comes with intense concentration; they call it flow,
a state of mind in which time slows down, distractions fall away, and activity
becomes effortless and supremely enjoyable.
With receptive awareness, you practice expanding your attention to include
the full range of your experiences, both inner and outer. The two together —
concentration and receptive awareness — combine to create the kind of
relaxed alertness you see in great performers, athletes, and martial artists.
Now, you couldn’t accuse them of being spaced out or ineffectual, could you?
How Can I Find the Time to Meditate 
in My Busy Schedule?
Ah yes, the perennial issue: time! Well, the great thing about meditation is
that it doesn’t really take all that much time. As soon as you pick up the
basics (by reading this book, of course), you can begin by practicing for
five or ten minutes each day. Mornings are generally best, at least to start.
You may want to sandwich a little quiet time between brushing your teeth
and taking a shower. Or if you’re an early bird, you can enjoy the precious
moments of stillness before the rest of the family wakes up.
Whatever time slot works best for you, the most important thing is to meditate
regularly — every day if possible, give or take a day here or there (and some
time to sleep late on Sundays). The reason for this recommendation is not to
turn you into an automaton, but rather to give you an opportunity to enjoy the
wonderful benefits of meditation, such as reduced stress and greater focus.
Like lifting weights or practicing a musical instrument, meditation doesn’t
really have an impact unless you keep it up and keep it regular.
As you meditate consistently over the days and weeks, you may begin to
notice little changes in your life — moments of ease or peace or harmony
you may not have experienced since childhood, if ever. And the more you
benefit from your meditation practice, the more you’re going to feel moti-
vated to carve out the time — and perhaps even extend the niche from 5 or
10 minutes to 15 or 20.
298
Part V: The Part of Tens 

I Can’t Sit on the Floor and Cross My
Legs — Can I Meditate in a Chair 
or Lying Down Instead?
Yes, absolutely. In fact, traditional meditation postures include sitting, stand-
ing, walking, lying down, and moving in particular patterns (for example, t’ai
chi or Sufi dancing). Basically, any position that you can comfortably sustain
is appropriate for meditation. (To find a posture that works for you, check out
Chapter 7.) Of course, lying down has its downside (so to speak): You’re more
likely to fall asleep. So, you may have to make a special effort (without getting
tense about it, that is) to stay alert and focused. Also, you’re better off lying
on a mat or carpet, rather than on your bed — for obvious reasons!
More important than whether you sit, lie, or stand for meditation is what you
do with your back. Slumping forward or tilting to the side, so your body fights
against gravity, may eventually prove painful and make it difficult to sustain
your practice over weeks and months. Instead, you can get into the habit of
extending your spine (as explained in Chapter 7), which contributes to good
posture in your other activities as well.
What Should I Do about the 
Restlessness or Discomfort I 
Feel When I Try to Meditate?
To begin with, you may find it comforting to realize that you’re not alone.
Everyone experiences agitation or discomfort in his or her meditation from
time to time — or even often. In fact, meditation acts like a mirror that reflects
you back to you. Believe it or not, that’s one of its virtues. When you stop your
busy life for a few minutes and sit quietly, you may suddenly notice all the
nervous energy and frenzied thinking that have been stressing you out all
along. Welcome to the world of meditation!
Initially, meditation involves focusing your attention on some object (like your
breathing or a word or phrase known as a mantra) and gently bringing your
attention back like a mischievous puppy whenever it wanders off. (For basic
meditation instructions, see Chapter 6, or listen to Track 4 on the CD.)
Gradually, you may notice that your restlessness and discomfort begin to
settle down by themselves.

Chapter 17: Answers to Ten Commonly Asked Questions about Meditation

When your concentration deepens, you can expand your awareness to
include first your sensations, and then your thoughts and emotions. At this
stage, you can begin to explore, make friends with, and ultimately even accept
your restlessness and discomfort. Though this process may not be an easy
one, it has broad implications because it teaches you the resilience and
peace of mind to accept unavoidable difficulties in every area of your life.
(For more on making friends with your experience, see Chapter 11.)
What Should I Do if I Keep Falling
Asleep while I Meditate?
Like restlessness, sleepiness is a common roadblock on the journey of medi-
tation. (For more on roadblocks, see Chapter 12.) Even the great meditators of
the past reported struggling with sleep — and some of them devised extreme
measures for staying awake, like tying their hair to the ceiling or meditating
on the edge of a cliff. Talk about determination!
Ordinary folks like you and me have the option of using gentler means to keep
ourselves awake and alert while we meditate. First, you may want to explore
the sleepiness a little. Where do you experience it in your body? Is it just
mental dullness, or are you physically tired as well? Perhaps you should be
napping rather than meditating!
If you decide to keep going, you can try opening your eyes wide and sitting up
as straight as possible to rouse your energy. If you still feel sleepy, splash some
cold water on your face or try meditating while standing or walking. In any case,
sleepiness doesn’t necessarily have to prevent you from meditating — after
all, sleepy meditation is better than no meditation at all.
How Can I Tell if I’m Meditating 
the Right Way? How Do I Know 
if My Meditation Is Working?
These two questions (actually flip sides of the same question) reflect the
goal-oriented perfectionist in each of us, who monitors our activities to make
sure we’re doing them right. The great thing about meditation is that you
300
Part V: The Part of Tens 

can’t do it wrong, short of not doing it at all. (In fact, it’s the perfectionist
that causes most of your stress — and the point of meditation is to reduce
stress, not intensify it.)
When you meditate, just set aside the perfectionist (as much as you can)
and keep gently returning to your focus in the here and now. (For detailed
meditation instructions, check out the other chapters in this book, especially
Chapter 6, or choose Track 4 on the CD.)
The experiences that may arise as you meditate — sleepiness, busy thoughts,
physical discomfort, restlessness, deep emotion — don’t indicate that you’re
going astray. Quite the contrary, they’re the grist for the mill of your meditation,
the old habits and patterns that get transformed as you deepen your practice.
(For more on transforming old patterns, see Chapter 11.)
As for knowing when your meditation is “working,” you probably won’t notice
any flashing lights or sudden jolts of energy. Instead, you may recognize sub-
tler shifts — for example, your friends or loved ones may remark that you
seem less irritable or stressed out than before, or you may find that you’re
less reactive in difficult situations. Again, don’t look for results, or, like the
proverbial watched pot, your meditation may never boil. Just trust in the
process and let the changes take care of themselves.
Can I Meditate while I’m Driving My 
Car or Sitting at My Computer?
Although you can’t practice formal meditation while you’re engaged in ordinary
activities, you can practice doing things meditatively. (For more on how to
meditate in everyday life, see Chapter 15.) During your daily periods of silent
meditation, you discover how to stay present as much as possible amidst the
welter of distracting thoughts, emotions, and sensations. Then, when you slip
behind the wheel of your car or sit down in front of your computer, you can
apply at least some of the same mindful, attentive presence to negotiate rush-
hour traffic or prepare a report. You’ll find that you accomplish the activity
with less effort and strain and enjoy yourself more.
It’s like practicing a sport — say, tennis. First, you need to work on your back-
hand again and again. Then, when you get into a match with a friend, you
know exactly what to do, even though the situation is more challenging and
complex.
301
Chapter 17: Answers to Ten Commonly Asked Questions about Meditation

Do I Have to Give Up My Religious
Beliefs in order to Meditate?
Definitely not. You can apply the basic principles and techniques of medita-
tion (as taught in this book and on the accompanying CD) to any spiritual or
religious tradition or orientation. In fact, many people find that meditation
methods with Eastern roots actually deepen their connection to their own
Western faith by supplementing prayer and belief with some direct experi-
ence of the love and presence of God.
Meditation just involves pausing in your busy life, taking a few deep breaths,
sitting quietly, and turning your attention inward. What you discover is not
Zen or Sufi or TM (Transcendental Meditation), but you — complete with all
your beliefs, affiliations, and personality traits!
What Should I Do if My Partner 
or Other Family Members 
Don’t Support Me in My 
Meditation Practice?
If your loved ones are openly antagonistic, you may need to meditate on the
sly or with an established group or class outside your home. But if they’re
merely resistant or tend to interrupt you at inopportune moments or demand
your attention when you’re just about to get quiet, you may want to talk with
them and explain your interest in meditation. Reassure them that you don’t
love them any less just because you’re spending five or ten minutes in silence
each day. Show them this book — or even lend them a copy so they can read
about meditation for themselves. After you’ve been practicing for a while, they
may begin to notice that you’re more enjoyable to be around — more relaxed,
more attentive, less distracted and stressed out — and their resistance may
gradually melt away. Who knows? One day they may decide to join you and
give meditation a try themselves.

Can Meditation Actually 
Improve My Health?
Yes, it can. Researchers have published hundreds of studies investigating
the health benefits of meditation, and the results consistently indicate that
people who meditate regularly have better health than those who don’t.
(For ten of the most persuasive studies, see Chapter 19. For a summary of
the health benefits of meditation, see Chapter 2.)
By bringing your mind and body into harmony and increasing your overall
level of peace, relaxation, and well-being, regular meditation facilitates the
release of life-enhancing chemicals into the bloodstream and bolsters the
immune response. You can also practice specific techniques developed over
the centuries by the great meditators of the past (and adapted for contempo-
rary Westerners) that are especially designed to stimulate the healing process.

Meditations 
In This Chapter
 Opening to the joys of relaxation
 Getting basic instruction in mindfulness, mantra, and lovingkindness meditations
 Using meditation for healing, grounding, and inner peace
H
ere are ten of my all-time favorite meditations, drawn from the pages of
this book. I’ve chosen them not only because I enjoy them, but also
because they provide a range of different practices for you to sample, from
elaborate visualizations to basic mindfulness techniques. (For more on mind-
fulness, see Chapter 6.) Feel free to experiment with these meditations straight
off the page, if you’re so inclined. With regular practice, they offer a taste of
the meditative experience. If you start hungering for the whole meal — well,
then go ahead and thumb through the rest of the book.
Practicing Relaxation
To reduce your stress and reap the other benefits of relaxation, try practicing
this simple exercise for 15 or 20 minutes each day. Known as the Relaxation
Response, it was developed in the 1970s by Herbert Benson, MD, a professor at
Harvard Medical School, based on research into the benefits of Transcendental
Meditation (TM).
1. Find a spot where you can sit quietly and undisturbed.
For more on how to create an environment conducive to meditation, see
Chapter 8.
2. Sit in a position that you can comfortably maintain for the duration of
your meditation.
For a complete discussion of sitting posture in meditation, including dia-
grams, see Chapter 7.

3. Choose an object to concentrate on.
This “object” can be a visual symbol (such as a geometric shape) or a
special syllable, word, or phrase, known as a mantra, that you repeat
again and again. (For more on mantras, see Chapters 3 and 13. For guid-
ance in practicing mantra meditation, listen to Track 2 on your CD.)
Objects with deep personal or spiritual meaning are especially effective.
As much as possible, keep your attention focused on this object; when
you get distracted, come back to your focus. (If your object is internal,
close your eyes.)
4. Maintain a receptive attitude.
Let thoughts, images, and feelings pass through without trying to hold
or interpret them. Resist the temptation to evaluate your progress; just
gently bring your attention back when it wanders.
With regular practice, you may gradually begin to notice that your body is more
relaxed and your mind is more peaceful — just a few of the many benefits of
meditation.
Following Your Breath
Drawn from the mindfulness tradition of Buddhism, this basic meditation
practice develops concentration and uses the breath to teach you how to
stay present from moment to moment, no matter where you are or what you
may be doing. For more-complete instructions (and more about mindfulness),
see Chapter 6 — or listen to Track 4 on the CD.
1. Begin by finding a comfortable sitting position that you can hold for
10 or 15 minutes.
Then take a few deep breaths and exhale slowly. Without trying to control
your breath in any way, allow it to find its own natural depth and rhythm.
Always breathe through your nose unless you can’t for some reason.
2. Allow your attention to focus either on the sensation of your breath
coming and going through your nostrils or on the rising and falling
of your belly as you breathe.
Although you’re welcome to alternate your focus from one session to
the next, sticking with a single focus for the entire meditation is best.
Eventually, you’re better off using the same focus each time you meditate.
3. Give your full attention to the coming and going of your breath.
Do it the way a mother tracks the movements of her young child — 
lovingly yet persistently, softly yet precisely, with relaxed yet focused
awareness.
306
Part V: The Part of Tens 

4. When you realize that your mind has wandered off and you’re
engrossed in planning, thinking, or daydreaming, gently but
firmly bring your mind back to your breath.
Thoughts and images will almost certainly continue to skitter and swirl
through your mind as you meditate, but don’t worry. Just patiently and
persistently keep coming back to your breath. If you find it virtually
impossible to follow your breath, you may want to begin with counting
your breaths (see Chapter 6).
5. Continue this simple (but not easy!) exercise for the duration of your
meditation.
With repeated practice, you may find that your mind settles down more
quickly — and that you’re more present and focused in other areas of
your life as well.
Walking Meditation
If you don’t feel like sitting still, you can try meditating while you walk. (For
guidance in walking meditation, listen to the appropriate track on your CD.)
A time-honored technique that’s practiced in monasteries and meditation
centers throughout the world, it’s a great way to discover how to translate
the focus you learn on your cushion or chair to the ordinary world of move-
ment and activity. If the weather allows, by all means walk outside. Or you
can just walk back and forth in your house, if you like.
1. Begin by walking at your usual pace, following your breath as you walk.
2. Coordinate your breathing with your walking.
For example, you can take three steps for each inhalation and three
steps for each exhalation — which, as you may notice, is considerably
slower than most people walk. If you want to change the speed of your
walking, just change the number of steps per breath. But maintain the
same pace each time you walk. (If your inhalations and exhalations are
different lengths, just adapt your walking accordingly.)
3. In addition to your breathing, be aware of your feet and legs as you
lift and move them.
Notice the contact of your feet with the ground or floor. Gaze ahead of
you, with your eyes lowered at a 45-degree angle. If you find it too com-
plicated to follow your breathing and be aware of your feet at the same
time, just choose one focus and stick with it. Be relaxed, easy, and com-
fortable as you walk.
4. Enjoy your steady, mindful walking for as long as you want.
If your attention wanders or you start to hurry, gently bring your atten-
tion back to your walking.

Chapter 18: Ten Favorite All-Purpose Meditations

Mindful Eating
Did you ever finish a meal and wonder what happened to the food? Well,
here’s a meditation for paying attention to what you’re putting into your
mouth. Not only will you enjoy your food as never before, but mindful
eating will facilitate your digestion by reducing the tension or stress you
bring to the table. (You probably won’t want to eat as meditatively as this
all the time, but you can still apply a little mindfulness to every meal, no
matter how informal.)
1. Before you begin eating, take a few moments to appreciate your food.
You may want to reflect on the earth and the sunshine that gave life to
this food and the people and effort that brought it to your table. Or you
can express your thanks to God or spirit — or simply sit silently and feel
grateful for what you have. If you’re eating with others, you may want to
hold hands, smile at one another, or connect in some other way.
2. Bring your awareness to your hand as you lift the first bite of food to
your lips.
You can experiment with the custom in certain monastic traditions of
eating more slowly than usual. Or just eat at your usual speed, but be
as mindful as you can.
3. Be fully aware as the first morsel of food enters your mouth and
floods your taste buds with sensations.
Notice the tendency of your mind to judge the flavor: “It’s too spicy or
salty” or “It’s not what I expected.” Notice any emotions that get stirred
up: disappointment, relief, irritation, joy. Be aware of any ripples of plea-
sure or warmth or other physical sensations. Enjoy your food!
4. If you talk while you eat, notice how the talking affects you.
Do certain topics cause you to tense up or give you indigestion? Does
the talk take you away from the enjoyment of your meal, or can you
have both?
5. Stay mindful of each mouthful as you gradually eat your meal.
This part is probably the hardest because most people have a tendency
to space out when they know how their food tastes. But you can continue
to enjoy the taste freshly, bite after bite. (If you get distracted, you can
stop and breathe for a moment or two before starting to eat again.)

Part V: The Part of Tens 

Cultivating Lovingkindness
Here’s a meditation for opening your heart and initiating a flow of uncondi-
tional love (also known as lovingkindness) to yourself and others. You may
want to begin with five or ten minutes of some basic meditation, such as the
Relaxation Response or following your breath, to deepen and stabilize your
concentration. (For a more-complete version of this meditation, turn to
Chapter 10, or listen to Track 7 on your CD.)
1. Begin by closing your eyes, taking a few deep breaths, and relaxing
your body.
2. Remember a time when you felt deeply loved.
Spend a few minutes dwelling on this memory and allowing your heart
to respond. Notice the gratitude and love that arise for the person who
loved you.
3. Allow these loving feelings to overflow and gradually suffuse your
whole being.
Allow yourself to be filled with love. You may also want to express the
wishes and intentions that underlie this love. For example, you might
say to yourself, as the Buddhists do, “May I be happy. May I be peaceful.
May I be free from suffering.” Feel free to use whatever words seem
right for you. As the recipient, be sure to take in the love as well as
extend it.
4. When you feel complete with yourself for now, imagine extending this
lovingkindness to a loved one or dear friend, using similar words to
express your intentions.
Don’t hurry; allow yourself to feel the love as much as you can, rather
than merely imagine it.
5. Extend this lovingkindness from your heart to all your loved ones and
friends.
Again, take your time.
6. Extend this lovingkindness to all people and all beings everywhere.
May all beings be happy. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be
free from suffering.

Softening Your Belly
Stephen Levine, an American meditation teacher who has written extensively
on healing and dying, counsels that the state of your belly reflects the state of
your heart. By consciously softening your belly again and again, you can let
go and open to the tender feelings in your heart. (The following meditation is
adapted from his book Guided Meditations, Explorations and Healings.)
1. Begin by sitting comfortably and taking a few deep breaths.
2. Allow your awareness to settle into your body.
3. Allow your awareness to descend to your belly as you gently soften
this area of your body.
Consciously let go of any tension or holding.
4. Allow your breath to enter your belly.
When you inhale, your belly rises. When you exhale, your belly falls.
5. With each breath, continue to soften your belly.
Let go of any anger, fear, pain, or unresolved grief you may be holding in
your belly.
6. As you continue to soften your belly, notice how your heart responds.
7. After five minutes or longer of this soft-belly meditation, open your
eyes and go about your day.
Every now and then, check in with your belly. If you notice that you’re
tensing it again, gently breathe and soften.
Healing with Light
Many meditation traditions suggest that physical illness and emotional suffer-
ing are just different facets of the same basic problem — just different ways
we contract away from our essential wholeness and health. Here’s an exercise
for directing the life-giving power of light to the places inside your body and
mind that cry out for healing:
1. Begin by sitting down and meditating in your usual way for several
minutes.
If you don’t have a usual way, you can find one in Chapter 6 — or just sit
quietly, close your eyes, and take a few slow, deep breaths, relaxing a little
on each exhalation.
2. Imagine a luminous sphere of white light suspended about a foot
above your head and slightly in front of you.
310
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Like a sun, this sphere embodies and radiates all the positive, healing,
harmonious qualities you most want to manifest in your life right now.
(You may want to be specific at first — strength, clarity, peace, love;
eventually, you can just flash on the light.) If you find it helpful, you can
imagine a spiritual being such as Jesus or Buddha in place of (or inside)
the sphere.
3. Imagine yourself soaking up all these qualities with the healing light
as though you were sunbathing.
4. Imagine this light radiating in all directions to the farthest corners of
the universe and drawing the energy of all the benevolent forces that
support your growth and evolution back into the sphere.
5. Visualize this positive, healing energy shining from the sphere, like
the light of a thousand suns streaming down through your body
and mind.
Imagine the energy eliminating all negativity and tension, darkness and
depression, worry and anxiety and replacing them with radiance, vitality,
peace, and all the other positive qualities you seek.
6. Continue to imagine this powerful, healing light flooding every cell
and molecule of your being, dissolving any contractions and stuck
places you may be aware of, and leaving you clean, clear, and calm.
7. Visualize this luminous sphere gradually descending into your heart,
where it continues to radiate this powerful light.
8. Imagine yourself as a luminous being with a sphere of light in your
heart that constantly radiates clarity, harmony, and purity — first
to every cell and particle of your own being and then, through you, to
every other being in every direction.
You can carry the feelings and images this exercise evokes throughout
the rest of your day.
Grounding into the Earth
When you’re feeling scattered or spaced out and you’ve lost touch with your
connection to the earthly plane of existence, you may find it helpful to use
the following meditation to ground you. (For detailed instructions, listen to
Track 10 on the CD.)
1. Begin by sitting quietly, closing your eyes, and taking a few slow, deep
breaths.
If possible, sit on the ground, with your back relatively straight (see
Chapter 7 for more on sitting positions).
311
Chapter 18: Ten Favorite All-Purpose Meditations

2. Focus your awareness on your lower abdomen, at a point about
2 inches below your navel and 11⁄2 inches inside your body.
Martial artists call this area the t’an t’ien (or hara) and believe it’s a focal
point for life energy, or chi. Explore this area with mindful attention,
noticing how it feels.
3. Direct your breath into this area, expanding it when you inhale and
contracting it when you exhale.
Consciously and deliberately breathe into your t’an t’ien for five minutes
or more, allowing your awareness and your energy to concentrate there.
Notice how your center of gravity shifts from the upper part of your body
to your t’an t’ien.
4. Continuing to breathe with your t’an t’ien, imagine that you’re a tree
with roots that go deep into the earth.
Both feel and visualize these roots originating in the t’an t’ien and growing
down through the base of your spine into the ground, spreading through
the soil as far down as you can imagine.
5. Feel and visualize these roots drawing energy up from the earth into
your t’an t’ien on the inhalation, and feel the energy spreading down
through the roots on the exhalation.
Continue to feel and visualize this circulation of energy — up on the
inhale, down on the exhale, for five or ten minutes.
6. When your t’an t’ien feels charged and strong, you can get up and go
about your day.
Every now and then, remind yourself to breathe with your belly again for
a minute or two.
Practicing a Half Smile
The Vietnamese Buddhist teacher Thich Nhat Hanh suggests that you can
actually shift your mood and restore your innate happiness by smiling con-
sciously, even when your spirits are low. Contemporary scientific research
agrees, indicating that smiling relaxes hundreds of facial muscles and has the
same effect on the nervous system as real joy. Besides, smiling encourages
others to smile and be happy as well.
1. Take a few moments right now to form your lips into a half smile.
312
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Notice how other parts of your body respond. Does your belly relax?
Does your back naturally straighten a little? Does your mood change
in subtle ways? Notice also if you have any resistance to smiling when
“you don’t really feel like it.”
2. Hold this half smile for at least ten minutes as you engage in ordinary
activities.
Do you notice a shift in how you act or respond to others? Do others
respond to your smile by smiling back?
3. The next time you feel your spirits sagging, practice this half smile for
at least half an hour and notice how you feel.
Peaceful Place
This simple meditation relaxes the body quickly and easily and can be used
to help facilitate healing. It’s also a kind of inner monastery or refuge that
you can escape to when you’re feeling threatened, unsafe, or stressed out.
(For guidance in imagining a peaceful place, listen to Track 12 on your CD.)
1. Begin by sitting comfortably, closing your eyes, and taking a few deep
breaths.
2. Imagine yourself in a safe, protected, peaceful place.
It may be a place you know well (a place in nature, for example, like a
meadow, a forest, or a beach), a place you’ve visited once or twice
before, or simply a place in your imagination.
3. Take as much time as you need to imagine this peaceful place as
vividly as you can, in all your senses.
Notice the colors, the shapes, the sounds, the light, the feeling of the air
against your skin, the contact of your feet against the ground. Explore
this special place to your heart’s content.
4. Allow yourself to rest in the feelings of comfort, safety, and tranquility
this special place evokes.
5. Spend as much time here as you want.
When you’re done, gradually return to the present moment and open
your eyes, while continuing to enjoy the pleasant, positive feelings
this exercise evoked.

W
hen expert Asian meditators began arriving in the West in the ’60s and
early ’70s, researchers jumped at the opportunity to hook them up to
EEGs and EKGs to test their unusual powers and abilities. (For more on the
history of meditation in the West, see Chapter 2.) Before long, Westerners were
becoming adept at meditation themselves, and scientific attention turned to
the potential health benefits of regular practice. In this chapter, I summarize
ten of the most revealing meditation studies, covering a range of ailments and
issues, from hypertension to depression. Ever wonder what meditation can
really do for you? Read on, and find out!
Meditation Makes You Happier — and
Boosts Your Immune System, Too
For thousands of years, monks and yogis in caves and monasteries have been
claiming that meditation gives you a more positive outlook on life — and most
regular practitioners would agree. But only recently have scientists been able
to prove it.

In a study published in Psychosomatic Medicine (Davidson et al., 2003),
researchers using state-of-the-art brain mapping and MRI technology were
able to determine that the regular practice of mindfulness meditation activates
the left prefrontal cortex of the brain — the area associated with positive
emotions. Employees of a biotech company who were taught the technique
over an eight-week period had significantly greater left-prefrontal activation
than a control group, not only immediately after their training but also four
months later. In other words, they became happier as they meditated — and
they stayed that way!
Even more surprising, the meditators had stronger immune systems than
the controls, as measured by the antibodies produced in response to a flu
vaccine — and the greater the left prefrontal activation (that is, the happier
they became), the stronger the boost in immune response!
Meditators Have Lower Blood Pressure
Everyone knows that meditation reduces stress, calms the body, and relaxes
the mind. Numerous studies have corroborated this finding. But how does
this overall relaxation translate into key physiological markers, such as blood
pressure?
In a pioneering study published in the British medical journal Lancet
(Patel, 1973), 20 hypertension patients were taught yoga, breath meditation,
muscle relaxation, and meditation concentration. At the end of 12 months
their systolic blood pressure had fallen from 159.1 to 138.7 — an average
of over 20 points! In another study, reported in the New England Journal of
Medicine (Stone and DeLeo, 1976), 14 subjects with moderate hypertension
were taught a Buddhist meditation that involved counting their breaths for
set periods each day for six months. At the end of this time, their systolic
blood pressure had dropped an average of 15 points.
These and similar studies show that regular meditation can be an effective
adjunct (or even alternative) to blood pressure medications for people with
moderate hypertension — without the risky side effects!
Meditation Reduces Cholesterol Levels
Although diet and heredity can certainly make you more susceptible to elevated
cholesterol, research has shown that chronic stress plays an important role
as well. So it makes good sense that practicing an effective stress-management
316
Part V: The Part of Tens 

technique like meditation would lower your cholesterol levels. Well, a pioneer-
ing study in the Journal of Human Stress (Cooper and Aygen, 1979) proves that
it does just that!
Twenty-three subjects with hypercholesterolemia (just a fancy word for
very high cholesterol!) were divided into two groups: 12 who practiced
Transcendental Meditation for 13 months, and 11 who did not. Paired com-
parisons showed that the meditators’ cholesterol dropped nearly 30 points,
from an average of 254 at the start of the period to 225 at the end. By con-
trast, the control group’s cholesterol dropped only 5 points, from 259 to 254.
Another study, of 40 female medical students who practiced TM and yoga,
reported that their average total cholesterol decreased from 196 to 165.
Given that meditation is safe, cheap, and readily available, the results are
impressive — and further evidence that mind and body are inextricably
entwined! So if your cholesterol tends to be high, don’t stop your medication
just yet — but do add meditation to your daily regime.
Meditation Improves Your Overall Health
If you wanted to prove that people who meditate are healthier overall than
those who don’t, how would you design your experiment? Well, one inge-
nious researcher at Maharishi International University in Fairfield, Iowa, set
out to measure whether Transcendental Meditation practitioners spent less
time in hospitals and doctors’ offices than a nonmeditating control group.
The study, published in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine (Orme-Johnson,
1987), compared how often 2,000 regular participants in the TM program used
medical insurance with how often a group of 600,000 non-meditators of the
same insurance carrier used their insurance over a five-year period. The two
groups were quite similar in terms of benefits, deductible, coinsurance pay-
ments, and distribution by gender. Yet the TM group used medical insurance
less often in all categories — for example, 50 percent fewer inpatient days
and 47 percent fewer outpatient visits for children (ages 0 to 18), 51 percent
fewer inpatient days and 47 percent fewer outpatient visits for young adults
(ages 19 to 39), and 69.4 percent fewer inpatient days and 73.7 percent fewer
outpatient visits for older adults (over 40 years old).
Even factoring in the likelihood that the TM practitioners ate better, smoked
less, exercised more, and favored uninsured alternative medical techniques,
the evidence for the overall health benefits of meditation was undeniable.
In every major medical treatment category, including cancer, infectious dis-
eases, and mental illness, hospital admissions for the TM group were lower
than the norm!
317
Chapter 19: Ten Meditation Research Studies — and What They Mean for You

Meditators Live Longer and Age Better
In another of the many studies to emerge from the TM movement, researchers
reporting their results in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology
(Alexander et al., 1989) found that older people who practiced meditation
had improved cognitive and behavioral abilities and lived longer than those
who did not. Seventy-three residents of eight homes for the elderly, with an
average age of 81, were randomly assigned to four different groups. One group
received no treatment; the other three received one of three treatments that
were quite similar in structure and expectations:
 The Transcendental Meditation program
 Mindfulness training in active distinction making (not to be confused
with mindfulness meditation)
 A relaxation (low mindfulness) program
On measures of associative learning, cognitive skills, mental health, aging,
and behavioral flexibility, the TM group fared significantly better than the
other three. And after three years, the Transcendental Meditation group had
a survival rate of 100 percent, compared with 87.5 percent for the mindfulness
training group and lower rates for the relaxation group and the non-meditating
group. Not only will you live longer if you meditate, this study suggests, but
your mind will stay sharper and you’ll be less prone to depression and other
mental-health problems.
Meditation Helps Reverse Heart Disease
Perhaps the most dramatic and persuasive study of the health benefits of
meditation and related lifestyle changes appeared in 1998 in the Journal of
the American Medical Association. The groundbreaking report landed its lead
author, Dr. Dean Ornish, on the cover of Newsweek and finally established an
unarguable link between meditation and heart health. The researchers found
that meditation, coupled with a low-fat, whole-foods, vegetarian diet; aerobic
exercise; smoking cessation; and group support; not only lowers your risk of
“cardiac events,” but can actually reverse the ravages of coronary artery dis-
ease, the primary cause of heart attacks.
The study followed 20 men and women with moderate to severe heart dis-
ease who made and maintained intensive lifestyle changes, including regular
meditation practice, for five years. Compared with a control group that made
318
Part V: The Part of Tens 

no lifestyle changes, these patients experienced half the number of cardiac
events. Even more impressive, their coronary arteries became progressively
less obstructed, whereas those of the control group got progressively worse.
Spurred by these findings, Dr. Ornish became a best-selling author, and his
Lifestyle Modification Program has been adopted by hospitals and HMOs
nationwide. At the core of his approach is the insight that love is the ultimate
healer. “If you want to heal your heart,” he writes, “you have to open your
heart.”
Meditation Makes You More Empathic
Most meditators would agree that their practice has helped them see beyond
their usual self-centered preoccupations and tune in to the feelings of others.
But can meditation actually make you measurably more empathic?
In a study reported in the Journal of Humanistic Psychology (Lesh, 1970), one
researcher investigated the relationship between Zen meditation (zazen) and
the development of empathy in counselors, using psychologist Carl Rogers’s
characterization of empathy as both the capacity to sense what the client is
feeling and the ability to communicate this sensitivity at a level attuned to the
client’s emotional state. One group of 16 students was taught zazen; another
group of 12 students volunteered to learn zazen but was not actually taught;
and a third group consisted of 11 students who were opposed to learning
meditation. All subjects were tested before the experiment and then again
four weeks later.
In fact, the group that practiced zazen did improve significantly in empathic
ability, while the two other groups did not. The results indicated that those
who started out least empathic and those who were most “open to experience”
improved the most.
In a related study, Dr. Paul Ekman, director of the Human Interaction Laboratory
at the University of California at San Francisco, tested three seasoned Tibetan
Buddhist meditators on their ability to read the subtle expressions that reveal
the emotions of others. Ordinarily, even professionals like psychotherapists are
no better at reading these facial cues than someone making random guesses.
Yet the three meditators, asked to read six emotions, were able to identify three,
four, and six out of six, respectively — an unprecedented result! No wonder that
meditation has become such a popular practice among therapists, coaches,
and others for whom empathy is an indispensable skill.

Mindfulness Speeds the 
Healing of Psoriasis
As a skin disease that’s measurably exacerbated by stress, psoriasis offers an
excellent proving ground for the effectiveness of meditation in facilitating the
healing of stress-related ailments. In a 1998 study published in Psychosomatic
Medicine, Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn, best-selling author and founder of the Stress
Reduction Clinic at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, and his
colleagues took 37 psoriasis patients who were about to undergo light treatment
for their condition and randomly assigned them to one of two situations: a
mindfulness meditation–based stress reduction intervention during treatments
or a light treatment alone.
The results were testimony to the potential value of meditation as an adjunct
to just about any treatment regime: The patients who meditated not only
responded better to light treatment than the non-meditating group, but
their psoriasis cleared up four times faster!
Meditation Ranks with Chocolate 
as a Mood-Enhancer
As every chocoholic knows, a single piece of the confection can lift you out of
the doldrums and mellow your mood. But not everyone knows that the active
ingredient in chocolate is a close cousin of the essential amino acid pheny-
lalanine, which enhances production of the neurotransmitters that keep us
happy. In fact, one research study found phenylalanine supplementation to
be as effective as a well-known antidepressant.
Well, the good news is that meditation boosts the body’s natural concentra-
tions of phenyalanine — without the added calories. In a study published in
Physiology and Behavior (Jevning et al., 1977), researchers measured amino
acid levels in 28 subjects, 15 of whom had practiced TM regularly for three to
five years. During meditation, phenylalanine levels in the TM group rose an
amazing 23 percent, compared with no change during relaxation for the control
group. So the next time you’re tempted to reach for the chocolate, consider
reaching for your meditation cushion instead!

Part V: The Part of Tens 

Meditation Relieves Pain
One of the best-documented clinical uses of meditation is the application of
mindfulness for the alleviation of chronic pain. During the 1980s, Dr. Jon Kabat-
Zinn and his colleagues published several studies proving its effectiveness.
According to a report in the Journal of Behavioral Medicine (Kabat-Zinn et al.,
1985), 90 chronic-pain patients who were trained in mindfulness meditation
in a 10-week stress reduction and relaxation program experienced significant
reductions in present-moment pain, negative body image, and the inhibition of
activity. Not only that, they popped fewer pain pills and felt better about them-
selves. At a 15-month follow-up, they were still doing better on all measures
except present-moment pain, and the majority continued to meditate — not a
surprising finding, given that chronic pain can be one of the most debilitating
conditions imaginable, and one of the most difficult to treat.
This one’s a sure thing: If you suffer from chronic pain, mindfulness medita-
tion should be one of the first alternative treatment options you try!

Meditation Resources

fter you’ve read this book, you may have a hankering to hook up with
other people who meditate, do some in-depth training, check out other
styles and approaches, or read books on particular aspects of meditation. So
here’s a listing of organizations and centers and a brief, annotated bibliogra-
phy of some good meditation books to complement this one.
Organizations and Centers
With the rapid spread of meditation in the West, centers and organizations
devoted to the practice have sprung up in every major city — and plenty of
small towns, too! Needless to say, I couldn’t possibly list them all in these pages.
So I offer you an annotated catalogue of major national organizations and 
(in the case of traditions like Zen, where no centralized organization exists)
representative centers. If you just want something nearby and don’t particularly
care about style or affiliation, Google the word meditation together with your
general location or the nearest city, or consult your local phone book, alterna-
tive newspaper, or New Age periodical. Otherwise, check out the following list. 
If an organization appeals to you, contact them directly for more information.
Note: Meditation instruction from these organizations often comes packaged
with a set of spiritual beliefs that may or may not interest you. Also, some
organizations offer free instruction, whereas others charge for the opportu-
nity. Finally, although most have been providing meditation instruction for
many years (or even decades), I haven’t personally checked them out, so I
can’t offer my double-your-money-back satisfaction guarantee.

Books
As you’ll discover if you check out your local alternative bookstore (or one 
of the online megastores like Amazon.com), meditation books abound —
though none, in my humble estimation, is as comprehensive or as user-
friendly as this one. Here’s a brief annotated list of some of my favorite titles.
Many focus on one particular technique or tradition; others emphasize the
application of meditation for healing, peak performance, or spiritual develop-
ment; and several are really not meditation books at all, but prolonged explo-
rations of related themes like enlightenment and Buddhism.
Buddhism For Dummies, by Jonathan Landaw and Stephan Bodian (Wiley, 2003)
Unlike most other religions, Buddhism focuses on practice rather than
doctrine, and this comprehensive, user-friendly introduction shows how
the tradition evolved throughout Asia and eventually brought its empha-
sis on mindful attention in the present moment to an eager Western audi-
ence. Includes chapters that explain Buddhist meditation, trace a typical
day in the life of a Buddhist in different traditions, and clarify key
Buddhist concepts like karma and enlightenment.
Christian Meditation: Experiencing the Presence of God, by James Finley
(HarperSanFrancisco, 2004)
From a spiritual counselor who studied with Catholic contemplative
Thomas Merton comes this clear introduction to using meditation as a
way to connect with the God around us. Defining meditation as a “form 
of prayerful reflection, using thoughts and images,” the author explores
some of the major themes of Christian meditation. He emphasizes the
importance of inhabiting our bodies in order to gain insight into the true
meaning of the Incarnation and the value of meditating on the tiune
(three-part) nature of God.
Dr. Dean Ornish’s Program for Reversing Heart Disease, by Dean Ornish, MD
(Ivy Books, 1995)
Though meditation is only one aspect of the Ornish program (along with
yoga, exercise, low-fat diet, and group support), this ground-breaking
book is a must-read for heart patients and their families — and a sobering
reminder for overachievers and other type-A personalities. The simple
but powerful message: To heal your heart, you have to open your heart.

tation master and scholar, this eminently readable book offers not only a

plex spiritual terms and ideas.

The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying, by Sogyal Rinpoche (HarperCollins, 1994)
Although this book transmits the traditional Tibetan Buddhist teachings

ing), it’s also filled with heartwarming stories and powerful practices that
can be applied not only to help with the dying process, but also to bring
more love and compassion into your life right now!

First made popular in the West by J. D. Salinger, this little book tells the
true story of a simple 19th-century Russian peasant who wanders the
countryside reciting the Jesus prayer (“Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on
me!”) and discovering love and joy wherever he goes. An inspiring tale of

Not an instruction manual, exactly, but a prolonged meditation on the
nature of meditation (and life) by one of the best-loved Zen masters of
our time, this book seamlessly weaves together profound insights and
practical guidance. A spiritual classic that is also eminently accessible.

Shareware programs are fully functional, free, trial versions of copyrighted
programs. If you like particular programs, register with their authors for a
nominal fee and receive licenses, enhanced versions, and technical support.
Freeware programs are free, copyrighted games, applications, and utilities.
You can copy them to as many PCs as you like — for free — but they offer 
no technical support.
GNU software is governed by its own license, which is included inside the
folder of the GNU software. There are no restrictions on distribution of 
GNU software. See the GNU license at the root of the CD for more details.

Trial, demo, or evaluation versions of software are usually limited either 
by time or functionality (such as not letting you save a project after you
create it).
Troubleshooting
I tried my best to compile a CD that works on most computers with the mini-
mum system requirements. Alas, your computer may differ, and the CD may
not work properly for some reason.
The two likeliest problems are that you don’t have enough memory (RAM), or
you have other programs running that are affecting installation or running of
the CD. If you get an error message such as Not enough memory or Setup
cannot continue, try one or more of the following suggestions and then
try using the software again:
 Turn off any antivirus software running on your computer. Installation
programs sometimes mimic virus activity and may make your computer
incorrectly believe that it’s being infected by a virus.
 Close all running programs. The more programs you have running, the
less memory is available to other programs. Installation programs typi-
cally update files and programs; so if you keep other programs running,
installation may not work properly.
 Have your local computer store add more RAM to your computer. This
is, admittedly, a drastic and somewhat expensive step. However, adding
more memory can really help the speed of your computer and allow
more programs to run at the same time.
If you have trouble with the CD-ROM, please call the Wiley Product Technical
Support phone number at 800-762-2974. Outside the United States, call 1-317-
572-3994. You can also contact Wiley Product Technical Support at http://
support.wiley.com. John Wiley & Sons will provide technical support only
for installation and other general quality-control items. For technical support
on the applications themselves, consult the program’s vendor or author.
