Building a Solid Personal Finance 
Foundation in Your 20s and 30s
You’re finished with school and entering the workforce. You want to make sure 
you create a firm foundation for your personal finances. Keep the following in 
mind when you start:
»
» Get a checkup: Just as you benefit from a health checkup, be sure to get a 
checkup on your finances to ensure you’re making the most of your money 
and your financial decisions.
»
» Determine what you need with transaction and savings accounts and 
evaluate which banks and other financial firms offer accounts that best 
meet your needs. Be on guard for high fees that erode your savings.
»
» Celebrate the savings habit. The earlier in life you’re able to save money 
regularly, the smaller the portion of your income you’ll need to save to 
accomplish a given goal. Scrutinize your current spending so you know where 
your money is going and you can identify what to do about it.
»
» Be on the lookout for spending reduction opportunities. Regularly saving 
money, especially on a modest income, is challenging. I present many ideas 
for reducing your spending, but ultimately, how you cut your spending is a 
matter of personal preference.
»
» Understand good and bad debt. Debt can be a useful tool to enable the 
purchase of real estate or other valuable assets. Avoid consumer debt, such 
as on credit cards and auto loans. Consumer debt tends to be costly, and the 
interest isn’t tax-deductible.

Managing Finances and Daily Living 
in Your Young-Adult Years
Getting a paycheck and having a job requires more responsibility. Be sure to consider 
these important points when you’re encountering finances in your 20s and 30s:
»
» Know and manage your credit score. Your credit score is a number that 
quantifies for lenders how likely you are to repay debts. Periodically access 
your credit reports, which you can do for free, and understand the steps you 
can take, as needed, to boost your credit score. Also take steps to protect 
your identity.
»
» Consider all options before deciding to rent or buy. Renting and sharing 
living space can be both economical and fun if you avoid the pitfalls. Buying 
and owning may make sense if you see yourself staying put for an extended 
period of time.
»
» Communicate with your partner about money. Money is often a source of 
friction in relationships. Thinking about money and planning how to manage it 
upfront with loved ones is usually time well spent.
Protecting Yourself and Your Income
Insurance plays a significant role in protecting your interests, including your 
health, your income, your property, and so on. Make sure you insure the 
following:
»
» Your health: Though you may feel that you’re not likely to need it, having 
health insurance is wise. With a properly designed plan, you can contain the 
cost and get needed coverage.
»
» Your income: Even if you have no dependents, you surely depend on your 
income, so you should have long-term disability insurance. And if you have 
dependents, you may need life insurance, too.
»
» Your possessions: Insurance on your car, home, and other valuable posses-
sions protects those assets from loss and damage and protects you from 
lawsuits. Beware, though, of small-stuff policies that aren’t worth buying.

Praise for Eric Tyson
“Eric Tyson is doing something important — namely, helping 
people at all income levels to take control of their financial futures. 
This book is a natural outgrowth of Tyson’s vision that he has 
nurtured for years. Like Henry Ford, he wants to make something 
that was previously accessible only to the wealthy accessible to 
middle-income Americans.”
— James C. Collins, coauthor of the national bestseller Built to Last; 
former Lecturer in Business, Stanford Graduate School of Business
“Personal Finance For Dummies is the perfect book for people who feel 
guilty about inadequately managing their money but are intimidated 
by all of the publications out there. It’s a painless way to learn how 
to take control.”
— National Public Radio’s Sound Money
“Eric Tyson . . . seems the perfect writer for a For Dummies book. He 
doesn’t tell you what to do or consider doing without explaining the 
whys and hows — and the booby traps to avoid — in plain 
English. . . . It will lead you through the thickets of your own 
finances as painlessly as I can imagine.”
— Chicago Tribune
“This book provides easy-to-understand personal financial 
information and advice for those without great wealth or knowledge 
in this area. Practitioners like Eric Tyson, who care about the well-
being of middle-income people, are rare in today’s society.”
— Joel Hyatt, founder of Hyatt Legal Services, one of the nation’s 
largest general-practice personal legal service firms

Introduction      1
Introduction
Y
our 20s and 30s are such an exciting time. During this period you’re experi-
encing some dramatic changes in your life, exploring new endeavors,  
making your way in the world, trying new things, and meeting new people.
But as with anything else in life, your young-adult years can be a scary time as 
well. Maybe you’ve experienced a failed relationship and a broken heart. You’ve 
likely had to deal with a difficult boss (or two) or a job (or two) you don’t like — or 
perhaps you’re in danger of losing your job.
And then there are the money issues. Most of you are out of the nest and out from 
under your parents’ wings, and your 20s are when you experience firsthand earn-
ing your own money and paying your own expenses. This isn’t true for all twenty-
somethings, of course, because some young people still live at home or have some 
financial dependence on their folks  — maybe that’s why they bought you this 
book! No matter your living situation, your early adult years can be a challenging 
time, but this friendly guide can help make those years a bit smoother 
financially.
About This Book
Based on my experiences teaching classes, counseling clients, writing articles and 
books, and corresponding with friends, family, and people through my website, 
I’ve discovered how important having healthy and strong personal finances is. 
With that in mind, I wrote this book to help you begin to lay a strong financial 
foundation. Your young-adult years are the best time to start.
I’ve worked with and taught people from all financial situations, so I know the 
financial concerns and questions of real folks just like you. Believe it or not, I first 
became interested in money matters when, as a middle-school student, my father 
was laid off and received some retirement money. I worked with my dad to make 
investing decisions with the money. A couple of years later, I won my high school’s 
science fair with a project on what influences the stock market.

2      Personal Finance in Your 20s & 30s For Dummies
In my 20s, I worked hard to keep my living expenses low and save money so I 
could leave my job and pursue my entrepreneurial ideas. I accomplished that goal 
in my late 20s. My goal in writing this book is to give you lots of tools and infor-
mation to help you get your personal finances in order so you, too, can achieve 
your goals and dreams.
I also wrote this book to protect you, to watch your back. Hucksters out to separate 
you from your hard-earned money know an easy mark when they see one, and 
being young and, therefore, less experienced makes you a target. You’re also at 
increased risk of “being taken” because your generation spends so much time 
online where the rules and agenda of many sites and apps are murky or worse. The 
information and advice in this book can help you identify and steer around com-
mon pitfalls and bad deals before you get hit.
Foolish Assumptions
No matter what your current situation is — whether you’re entering the job mar-
ket right after school, graduating college with or without student loans, living 
with your parents, or living on your own — I thought of you as I wrote this book. 
I made some assumptions about you:
»
» You want expert advice about important financial topics — such as getting a 
financial checkup, budgeting, paying off some debt, boosting your credit 
score, or investing — and you want answers quickly.
»
» Or perhaps you want a crash course in personal finance and are looking for a 
book you can read cover to cover to help solidify major financial concepts and 
get you thinking about your finances in a more comprehensive way.
»
» Or maybe you’re just tired of feeling financially frazzled and want to get better 
organized and on top of your money matters.
This book is basic enough to help a novice get his or her arms around thorny 
financial issues. But readers who are a bit more advanced in financial matters will 
be challenged, as well, to think about their finances in a new way and identify 
areas for improvement.

W
here did your childhood and those years go? Was it that long ago that 
you were concerned with what exams you had coming up, what you 
might be doing over your summer break, and what kind of job you were 
interested in and qualified to do?
As a young adult, you wonder where you are going to live, how much a decent 
apartment will cost, and how much you will actually have left over after taxes and 
those other pesky deductions are taken from your paycheck. How much will it cost 
to buy a home that you’ll really want? What are the best ways to save and invest 
your money?
Those are some pretty big questions that even people 20 and 30 years older than 
you struggle to answer. You’re wise to be thinking about these topics now. In this 
chapter, I help you start to answer those questions by showing you how to evalu-
ate your net worth, savings rate, credit health, investment portfolio, and insur-
ance coverage so you can develop and implement a killer plan tailored to your 
situation.

8      PART 1  Getting Started with Personal Finance
Calculating Your Financial Worth
Having a sense of what you own (your assets) and what you owe (your liabilities) is 
important because it provides some measure of your financial security and your 
ability to accomplish financial goals such as buying a home, starting a business, 
or retiring someday.
In this section, I define net worth and then walk you through the relatively simple 
calculations of determining your own personal net worth.
Defining net worth
Your net worth is quite simply your financial assets (for example, bank and invest-
ment accounts) minus your financial liabilities (debts such as student loans and 
credit-card debt). In the following sections, I walk you through how to perform 
these calculations.
When I discuss your monetary net worth, I’m not talking about personal posses-
sions. Your car, clothing, television, computer, and other personal items all have 
some value, of course. If you need to sell them, you could get something for them 
on Craigslist or eBay. But the reality is that you’re unlikely to accumulate personal 
items with the expectation of later selling them to finance such personal goals as 
buying a home, starting a business, retiring, and so forth. After all, these things 
are investments that decline rapidly in value after purchase and use.
Figuring what you own: Financial assets
To calculate your financial assets, access your bank statements and investment 
account statements, including retirement accounts and any other documentation 
that can help you. You may have only one or two accounts, and that’s fine. Add up 
all the values of these accounts to find out what you own.
It’s common for most young adults to be in the early stages of accumulating 
assets. This book helps you change and improve upon that.
In addition to excluding personal property and possessions because folks don’t 
generally sell those to accomplish their personal and financial goals, I would also 
probably exclude your home as an asset if you happen to own one. (You can include 
it if you expect to downsize or to rent in retirement and live off of some of your 
home’s equity.)

CHAPTER 1  Your Financial Checkup      9
Now, I do have one exception to something that isn’t generally thought of as a 
financial asset, which you may or may not want to include in this category. Some 
people have valuable collections of particular items, be they coins, sports memo-
rabilia, or whatever. You can count such collections as assets, but remember that 
they’re only real assets if you’d be willing to sell them and use the proceeds toward 
one of your goals.
Determining what you owe:  
Financial liabilities
Most people accumulate debts and loans during periods in life when their expen-
ditures exceed their income. I did that when I went through college. You may have 
student loans, an auto loan, and credit-card debts. Access any statements that 
document your loans and debts and figure out the grand total of what you owe.
VALUING SOCIAL SECURITY AND PENSIONS
Now or in the years ahead, you may accumulate some retirement benefits based on 
your years of work. You may do so through the federal government’s Social Security 
program and/or through an employer’s pension plan.
When you work and earn money, your employer (or you if you’re self-employed) pays 
taxes into Social Security, which earns you future Social Security retirement income ben-
efits. Under current laws, which of course may change, you’re eligible to receive full 
Social Security benefits at age 67. (You may collect a benefit reduced by 30 percent if 
you begin receiving your Social Security payments at age 62.)
In surveys, most young adults say that they’re more likely to believe in things like UFOs 
than in actually getting money out of Social Security! Although being skeptical and  
questioning things is useful, such deep cynicism about Social Security isn’t well founded. 
Those who are eligible to receive benefits (generally, folks who’ve paid Social Security 
taxes above relatively low threshold amounts over at least ten years in total) should  
get them.
Some employers provide a retirement benefit known as a pension that’s paid to you in 
retirement based on your years of service (employment) with the organization. Your 
employer puts aside money above and beyond your salary compensation into a sepa-
rate account to fund your future pension payments. Pension plans are more common 
in public-sector organizations (governments, schools, and so on) and larger companies, 
especially those with labor unions. Pension plans are generally insured/guaranteed by 
government agency entities.

Netting the difference
After you total your financial assets and your financial liabilities, you can subtract 
the latter from the former to arrive at your net worth.
financial assests
financial liabilities
net worth
Don’t worry if you have a small or negative net worth (where you have more debt 
than assets). There’s no point wringing your hands over the results — you can’t 
change history. And, it doesn’t matter how you compare with your peers even if we 
can accurately define exactly who your peers are. This isn’t a competition or test.
But you can change the direction of your finances in the future and boost your net 
worth surprisingly fast to work toward accomplishing your personal goals. First, 
you have to figure your savings rate and how to increase it, which I discuss next.
Grasping the Importance of Savings
To accomplish important personal and financial goals such as buying a home, 
starting a business, traveling, and someday retiring, most folks need to save 
money. Some exceptions do exist, such as those folks who have trust funds or 
inherit significant-enough sums that they don’t need to save money from their 
work earnings. But the vast majority of people must save in order to accomplish 
their goals.
You can’t effectively save for a long-term goal if you don’t know what your sav-
ings rate is. When I worked as a financial counselor and taught adult-education 
money-management courses, I was struck by how few people knew the rate at 
which they were saving money. Most people can tell you how much they earned 
from their work over the past year, but few folks really know what portion of their 
employment income they were able to save. That’s because to have an accurate 
idea of this percentage, you really need to do some analysis and calculations. The 
math isn’t that complicated, but it does require some time and effort, especially if 
you haven’t been tracking your spending or net worth over the past year. In the 
following sections, I explain a couple of different ways to calculate your savings 
rate over the past year.
Netting your income and spending
The first way to determine your savings rate is to tally your employment income 
and expenses over the past year. By subtracting your total expenses, including 
taxes, from the past year from your employment income, you can arrive at net 
savings.

CHAPTER 1  Your Financial Checkup      11
The employment income part of the equation is simple for most folks  — it’s  
simply the total amount of your paychecks from work. But unless you systemati-
cally track your spending, that piece of the puzzle is a lot more work to figure. I 
walk you through how to compile your spending in Chapter 5.
Assessing the change in your net worth
If you don’t want to be bothered with the time-consuming task of tabulating your 
spending over the past year, here’s an alternative method for arriving at your sav-
ings rate that may be quicker for you. Follow these few easy steps, and fill in the 
blanks in Table 1-1.
1.	 Calculate your net worth.
Refer to the earlier section “Netting the difference” for an explanation of how 
to do so.
2.	 Calculate your net worth from one year ago.
You can determine your year-ago net worth by tallying your financial assets 
(savings and investments) from one year ago and subtracting your financial 
liabilities (loans and debts) from one year ago. Don’t count your home as an 
asset or your mortgage as a liability. Your concern here is financial assets.
3.	 Correct for any changes in value of investments you owned the past year.
Suppose that your net worth today is $15,000, whereas one year ago it was 
$10,000. You might conclude from the change in your net worth that you’ve 
saved $5,000 $
,
$
,
15 000
10 000 , but that figure may not be correct, and 
here’s why. A year ago when you had a net worth of $10,000, you presumably 
had savings and investments, and those would have changed in value over the 
past year. Suppose you made some good investments and they produced 
$1,000 in returns (from interest, dividends, appreciation, and so on) over the 
past 12 months. Though you’re happy to have made $1,000 on your invest-
ments, that money isn’t new savings and shouldn’t be counted in your 
savings-rate calculations. So you really saved $4,000 $ ,
$ ,
5 000
1 000 .
Conversely, if your net worth was reduced over the past year by declines in the 
value of your investments, you should add back that figure when determining 
your savings rate. If your investments declined by $1,500 in value over the past 
year, you really saved $6,500 $ ,
$ ,
5 000
1 500 . Table 1-1 walks you through 
this part of the analysis.
If you have debt that you’ve been paying down over the past year, you can count 
the principal payment reduction on that debt as savings. For example, suppose a 
year ago you owed $5,000 on an auto loan. Now, a year later, you owe just $4,500. 
You can count that $500 reduction in what you owe as new savings.

12      PART 1  Getting Started with Personal Finance
Understanding and Improving  
Your Credit Score
If you expect to someday apply for a loan of any type and get a competitively low 
interest rate, you should understand your credit report and credit score and how 
to improve them. A credit report is basically your credit history, while a credit score 
is a three-digit score based on the information in your personal credit report. This 
section highlights what you need to know about your credit score and reports, 
including how to obtain and improve them. Chapter 4 provides more insight into 
managing your credit report and credit score.
Deciphering how lenders use  
credit reports and scores
Most people borrow money at various times in their life, whether it’s to buy a 
home (or other real estate), to finance a small business, pay for educational 
expenses, or for other purposes. When you want to borrow money, lenders exam-
ine your credit report and your credit score(s) to determine how responsible 
you’ve been with credit and to help them decide whether they should lend you 
money (and if so, how much to charge you).

CHAPTER 1  Your Financial Checkup      13
Specifically, lenders examine your history of credit usage in your credit report. 
This information tells the lender when each of your accounts was opened, what 
the recent balance is, your track record of making payments on time, and whether 
you’ve defaulted on any loans. A credit report also tells a prospective lender who 
has recently accessed your credit report and thus would indicate where else you’ve 
been applying for credit.
Lenders use your credit score to help them predict the likelihood that you’ll default 
on repaying your borrowings. The higher your credit score the better, because a 
high credit score means that you have a lower likelihood of defaulting on a loan. 
Thus, more lenders will be willing to extend you credit and charge you lower rates 
for that credit.
The most widely used credit score is the FICO score, which was developed by the 
FICO company (formerly known as Fair, Isaac and Company). FICO scores range 
from a low of 300 to a high of 850. Most scores fall in the 600s and 700s, and the 
median is around 720. You generally qualify for the best lending rates if your 
credit score is in the mid-700s or higher.
Obtaining your credit reports  
and fixing errors
You want to get your hands on your credit report so you know what lenders are 
reviewing. You’re entitled to receive a free copy of your credit report (which does 
not contain your credit score) every 12 months from each of the three credit 
bureaus  — Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. If you visit www.annualcredit 
report.com, you can view and print copies of your credit report from each of the 
three credit agencies. (Alternatively, you can call 877-322-8228 and request that 
your reports be mailed to you.)
When you receive your reports, inspect them for possible mistakes. Credit- 
reporting bureaus and the creditors who report credit information to these bureaus 
make plenty of errors.
If your problems are fixable, there’s no need to hire someone to do so for you — 
you can direct getting them fixed yourself, but you will likely have to make some 
phone calls or write a letter or two. Some credit-report errors arise from other 
people’s negative information getting on your credit report. This can happen if 
you have a common name, have moved a lot, or for other reasons. If the problem-
atic information on your report appears not to be yours, tell that particular credit 
bureau and explain that you need more information because you don’t recognize 
the creditor.

14      PART 1  Getting Started with Personal Finance
Creditors are the source of some reporting mistakes as well. For example, perhaps 
a bill you paid off is still incorrectly being reported as a balance you owe. If that’s 
the case with your report, write or call the creditor to get the incorrect information 
fixed. Phoning first usually works best. (The credit bureau should be able to tell 
you how to reach the creditor if you don’t know how.) If necessary, follow up with 
a letter or an email. You can also dispute errors online directly with the credit 
reporting agency.
Whether you speak with a credit bureau or an actual lender, make notes of your 
conversations. If representatives say that they can fix the problem, get their name 
and extension, and follow up with them if they don’t deliver the promised results. 
If you’re ensnared in bureaucratic red tape, escalate the situation by speaking 
with a department manager. By law, bureaus are required to respond to a request 
to fix a credit error within 30 days. And if you file a dispute and the creditor 
doesn’t respond, the credit bureau must then remove the derogatory item.
You and a creditor may not see eye to eye on a problem, and the creditor may 
refuse to budge. If that’s the case, credit bureaus are required by law to allow you 
to add a 100-word explanation to your credit file. Just remember that if you go this 
route, be factual in your write-up and steer clear of broad attacks on the creditor 
(such as “their customer service sucks”).
Avoid “credit-repair” firms that claim to be able to fix your credit report prob-
lems. In the worst cases I’ve seen, these firms charge outrageous amounts of 
money and don’t come close to fulfilling their marketing hype. If you have legiti-
mate glitches on your credit report, credit-repair firms can’t make the glitches 
disappear. As I explain earlier in this section, you can easily fix errors on your own 
without the charge.
Getting your credit score
Many folks are disappointed to find that their credit reports lack their credit score. 
The reason for this is quite simple: The 2003 law mandating that the three credit 
agencies provide a free credit report annually to each U.S. citizen who requests a 
copy did not mandate that they provide the credit score. Thus, if you want to 
obtain your credit score, it’s generally going to cost you.
One circumstance allows you to get one of your credit scores for free, but unfor-
tunately, you can only do so when you’re turned down for a loan. Current law 
allows you to obtain a free copy of the credit score a lender used in making a nega-
tive decision regarding your desired loan.
For recommended websites to use to obtain your credit score as well as those to 
avoid, please see Chapter 4.

CHAPTER 1  Your Financial Checkup      15
Improving your credit reports and score
Take an interest in improving your credit standing and score rather than throwing 
money away to buy your credit score or paying for some ongoing monitoring ser-
vice to which you may not pay attention. Working to boost your credit rating is 
especially worthwhile if you know that your credit report contains detrimental 
information or if your score is lower than 740.
Here are the most important actions that you can take to boost your attractiveness 
to lenders:
»
» Check your credit reports for accuracy. Correct any errors, and be espe-
cially sure to get accounts removed if they aren’t yours and they show late 
payments or are in collection. Refer to the earlier section “Obtaining your 
credit reports and fixing errors” for more information.
»
» Pay all your bills on time. To ensure on-time payments, sign up for auto-
matic bill payment, which most companies encourage customers to use. This 
enables companies to automatically deduct (typically monthly) what you owe 
from your checking account or to charge that amount to your credit card so 
you don’t have to remember to pay the bill. (This also prevents you from being 
charged interest or late fees when you make a payment after the due date.)
»
» Be loyal if it doesn’t cost you. The older the age of loan accounts you have 
open, the better for your credit rating. Closing old accounts and opening a 
bunch of new ones generally lowers your credit score, so don’t jump at a new 
credit-card offer unless it’s really going to save you money, such as if you’re 
carrying credit-card debt at a high interest rate and want to transfer that 
balance to a lower-rate card (or provide you with rewards/benefits greatly in 
excess of any costs). Ask your current credit-card provider to match a lower 
rate you find elsewhere.
»
» Limit your total debt and number of debt accounts. The more loans, 
especially consumer loans (credit cards, auto loans, and so on), that you hold 
and the higher the balances, the lower your credit score will be. Work to pay 
down consumer revolving debt, such as on an auto loan and credit cards. See 
Chapter 5 for more information.
Comprehending Your Investment Options
If you’re like most folks in their 20s or 30s, you may not have saved as much as 
you would have liked during your early working years. That’s fine for now, because 
together, we address that in this book. Regardless of how much (or how little) you 

16      PART 1  Getting Started with Personal Finance
have invested in banks, mutual funds, or other types of accounts, you want to 
invest your money in the wisest way possible and have it grow over time without 
exposing it to extraordinary risks.
In this section, I provide some background to help you understand how to best 
focus your efforts to become a more knowledgeable and successful investor. (In 
Part 3, I delve into all the important details of investing.)
»
» Investment options: Making the best investments without understanding 
your range of options and the strengths and weaknesses of each is difficult. 
Do you understand the investments that you currently own, including their 
potential returns and risks? If you invest in or plan to invest in individual 
stocks, do you understand how to evaluate a stock, including reviewing the 
company’s balance sheet, income statement, competitive position, price- 
earnings ratio versus its peer group, and so on?
Last but not least are issues that come up if you work with a financial advisor 
for investment advice. Do you understand what that person is recommending 
that you do, are you comfortable with those actions and that advisor, and 
is that person compensated in a way that minimizes potential conflicts of 
interest in the strategies and investments he or she recommends? See 
Chapter 18 for advice on hiring professionals.
»
» Tax considerations: For many working people, taxes are either the number-
one or -two largest expense categories. For starters, do you know what 
marginal income tax bracket (combined federal and state) you’re in, and do 
you factor that in when selecting investments? For money outside of retire-
ment accounts, do you understand how these investments produce income 
and gains and whether these types of investments make the most sense given 
your tax situation?
»
» Short-term money: Short-term money includes money you’d use in an 
emergency or for a major purchase within the next few years. Do you have 
enough money set aside for short-term emergencies, and is that money in an 
investment where it doesn’t fluctuate in value? Is the money that you’re going 
to need for a major expenditure in the next few years invested in a conserva-
tive, low-volatility investment?
»
» Long-term money: Long-term money includes money set aside for longer-
term use such as for retirement. Do you have your money in different, 
diversified investments that aren’t dependent on one or a few securities or 
one type of investment (that is, bonds, stocks, real estate, and so on)? Is the 
money that you’ve earmarked for longer-term purposes (more than five 
years) invested to produce returns that are greater than the rate of inflation?

CHAPTER 1  Your Financial Checkup      17
Examining Insurance Coverage
Just about everyone dislikes spending money on insurance. Who enjoys thinking 
about risks and possible catastrophes and then shopping for insurance that you 
hope will pay some of the bills should said catastrophes strike? Therein lies some 
major reasons why most people don’t have all the coverage they really need and 
don’t get the best value when they do buy insurance. But folks who’ve suffered a 
major loss understand the security provided by a good policy.
In Part 4, I discuss everything you need to know about insurance, including what 
policies you do and don’t need. Here are the major points to consider as you review 
your insurance knowledge:
»
» Smart shopping: Do you know when it makes sense to buy insurance through 
fee-for-service advisors and companies that sell directly to the public (bypass-
ing agents) — and when it doesn’t? Do you shop around for the best price on 
your insurance policies at least every couple of years? Do you know whether 
your insurance companies have good track records when it comes to paying 
claims and keeping customers satisfied?
»
» Coverage understanding: Do you understand the individual coverages, 
protection types, and amounts of each insurance policy you have? Does your 
current insurance protection make sense given your current personal and 
financial situation (as opposed to your situation when you bought the policies)?
»
» Income protection: If you wouldn’t be able to make it financially without your 
employment income, do you have adequate long-term disability insurance 
coverage? If you have family members who are dependent on your continued 
working income, do you have adequate life-insurance coverage to replace 
your income should you die?
»
» Liability protection: Do you carry enough liability insurance on your home, 
car (including umbrella/excess liability), and business to protect all your assets?
Identifying Common Financial  
Mistakes Young Adults Make
Your financial checkup is complete if you’ve been working along with me since the 
beginning of this chapter. The results should help you best understand where you 
can get the biggest return on your time invested elsewhere in the book.

18      PART 1  Getting Started with Personal Finance
One motivation for reading the rest of the book is to reduce your chances of mak-
ing common mistakes. Your 20s and 30s are decades where lack of financial 
knowledge is exposed and reflected in the beginning of costly money mistakes 
such as
»
» Spending excessively and accumulating consumer debt: Too many young 
adults leave home being experts in spending without having learned much 
about living within their means and saving and investing. Many things may 
tempt you — the never-ending stream of gadgets and electronics, cars, 
restaurants, bars, nightclubs, new clothing, concerts, sporting events, and so 
on. Check out Chapter 5 for information about reducing your spending on 
items you don’t need.
»
» Defaulting on student loans or other debts: This problem is often the 
consequence of the preceding problem of spending too much and accumulat-
ing too much debt. Being overwhelmed with debt, which may be exacerbated 
by a job loss or unexpected expenses, can cause folks to fall behind on their 
student loan or other debt payments. Given the ridiculously high cost of 
college these days, the amount of student debt that some young graduates 
have accumulated is also ridiculously large! See Chapter 3 for information on 
paying down debts.
»
» Experiencing failed relationships that damage your credit rating and 
financial health: You know what they say about love being blind sometimes, 
right? Well, one of the things many 20- and 30-somethings don’t think about 
when in a relationship is how the things they’re doing are going to work out or 
not work out should the relationship fail. Sharing bank accounts and bill 
paying may not present glaring problems when everything is going well, but 
you can quickly end up with a tarnished credit report should your love boat 
run aground. See Chapter 8 for info about relationships and money.
»
» Falling behind on tax payments and violating tax laws: Filing your annual 
tax return and making quarterly tax payments if you’re self-employed aren’t 
enjoyable tasks. In fact, you may find these chores downright intimidating and 
stressful. But if you fail to complete them correctly, or complete them at all, 
you could get socked with hefty interest and penalty charges and possibly do 
some jail time in the worst cases. Check out Chapter 6 for a complete 
discussion of paying taxes.
»
» Making poor investments: You work hard to earn money and then to save it. 
So you should do your homework to ensure that you invest it well. Don’t rush 
into making an investment you don’t understand, because you have a lot to 
lose. There are plenty of slick-talking salesmen who will sell you an investment 
that helps to line their pockets but not yours. You also don’t want your money 

CHAPTER 1  Your Financial Checkup      19
sitting around for years on end in a low-interest bank account, which is what 
often happens to folks who don’t know how to invest. Go to Chapter 10 for 
more in-depth information about investing your money.
»
» Neglecting to secure proper insurance coverage: Most young people don’t 
spend a lot of time thinking about risks. After all, most young adults are 
healthy and energetic. So things like health insurance or disability insurance 
seem unnecessary and for older folks. The good news is that insurance costs 
less when you’re younger because you’re less likely to suffer a major illness or 
disability than someone decades older than you. See the chapters in Part 4 for 
all the details about insurance.
»
» Being taken and duped by biased and/or shoddy advice: Many companies 
and people have something to sell. Some of what they’re selling is good stuff, 
much is mediocre, and some is downright awful. You don’t need to pay high 
commissions or end up in the wrong type of investments or insurance. Check 
out Chapter 18 for what you need to know about dealing with professionals.

Budgeting, Goal Setting, 
and Valuing Saving
U
nless you’re the offspring of wealthy parents or grandparents who have 
left you a sizable sum of money, you need to save money to accomplish 
your personal and financial goals. Early in your working years, saving 
money can be a challenge, of course. Although you’re likely not earning a super-
high income, you can live life and still buy the items (like a car and furniture) 
you need.
When you’re first starting out, your salary is probably somewhat low, and after 
fixed expenses (such as rent/mortgage, food, insurance, and other payments that 
you can’t easily get rid of), you may not have much money left for “fun” discre-
tionary spending, let alone additional savings. Remember, though, that when it 
comes to building wealth, it doesn’t matter what you make, it’s what you spend 
and, therefore, are able to save. Many wealthy people didn’t get rich based exclu-
sively on their big salaries, but through disciplined savings and wise investing 
over time.
In this chapter, I discuss smart budgeting strategies and the tremendous and sur-
prising long-term value that comes from regular saving and investing.

22      PART 1  Getting Started with Personal Finance
Developing a Savings Mind-Set
People typically learn their financial habits, both good and not so good, at a young 
age. During childhood, most people are exposed to messages and lessons about 
money, both at home with their parents and siblings and also in the world at 
large, such as at school and with their friends.
The expression “You can’t teach an old dog new tricks” has some validity, at least 
for our four-legged friends, but even then, the expression actually requires some 
modification to be accurate. It should be, “It’s hard to teach an old dog new tricks, 
but how hard it is depends on the dog.”
My experiences have shown me the same to be true for people and their financial 
habits and decision making. For most people, spending money is easier and more 
enjoyable than earning and saving it. Of course, you can and should spend money, 
but there’s a world of difference between spending money carelessly and spend-
ing money wisely.
I show you how to save money, even if you haven’t been a good saver before. And 
even if you do think you’re pretty good at saving, I have some tips and tricks so 
you can get even better at saving more and spending less:
»
» Live within your means. Spending too much is a relative problem. If you 
spend $40,000 per year and your income is $50,000 annually, you should be in 
good shape and will be able to save a decent chunk of your income. But if your 
income is only $35,000 per year and you spend $40,000 annually, you’ll be 
accumulating debt or spending from your investments to finance your lifestyle.
How much you can safely spend while working toward your financial goals 
depends on what your goals are and where you are financially. At a minimum, 
you should be saving at least 5 percent of your gross annual (pretax — that is, 
before taxes are deducted from your paycheck) income, and ideally, you 
should save at least 10 percent.
»
» Search for the best values. The expression “You get what you pay for” is an 
excuse for being a lazy shopper. The truth is that you can find high quality and 
low cost in the same product. Conversely, paying a high price is no guarantee 
that you’re getting high quality. When you evaluate the cost of a product or 
service, think in terms of total, long-term costs. Buying a cheaper product only to 
spend a lot of additional money servicing and repairing it is no bargain. Research 
options and comparison shop to understand what’s important to you. Don’t 
waste money on bells and whistles that you don’t need and may not ever use. 
Is that $700 smartphone significantly better than the best $200 smartphones?
»
» Don’t assume brand names are the best. Be suspicious of companies that 
spend gobs on image-oriented advertising. Branding is often used to charge 

CHAPTER 2  Budgeting, Goal Setting, and Valuing Saving      23
premium prices. Blind taste tests have demonstrated that consumers can’t 
readily discern quality differences between high- and low-cost brands with 
many products. Question the importance of the name and image of the 
products you buy. Companies spend a lot of money creating and cultivating 
an image, which has no impact on how their products taste or perform.
When you’re grocery shopping, consider the store or house brand. Most of 
the time the ingredients are the same as the brand-name product (and may 
even be made by that same company). You don’t need to shell out money to 
pay for the name, as store/house brands are typically much less costly than 
the well-known brands in a given category.
»
» Get your refunds. Have you ever bought a product or service and not gotten’ 
what was promised? What did you do about it? Most people do nothing and let 
the company off the hook. Ask for your money back or at least a partial refund.
If you don’t get satisfaction from a frontline employee, request to speak with 
a supervisor. Most larger companies have websites through which you can 
submit complaints. Reputable companies that stand behind their products 
and services will offer partial refunds or gift cards good toward a future 
purchase. If all else fails and you bought the item with your credit or debit 
card, dispute the charge with the credit-card company. You generally have up 
to 60 days to dispute and get your money back.
»
» Trim your spending fat. What you spend your money on is sometimes a 
matter of habit rather than a matter of what you really want or value. When 
was the last time you comparison priced and shopped for the most common 
things that you buy? You need to set priorities and make choices about where 
you want and don’t want to spend your money. See Chapter 5 for lots of tips 
for reducing your spending.
»
» Turn your back on consumer credit (for example, credit-card debt, auto 
loans). Borrowing money to buy consumer items that depreciate (such as cars 
and electronics) is hazardous to your long-term financial health. Buy only what 
you can afford today. If you’ll be forced to carry a debt on credit cards or an 
auto loan for months or years on end, you can’t really afford what you’re buying 
on credit today (see Chapter 19 for the details on saving on cars). Not only does 
consumer debt enable you to spend more than you can afford today, but the 
interest rate on that consumer debt is generally high, and it isn’t tax-deductible.
If you spend too much and spend unwisely, you put pressure on your income and 
your future need to continue working, perhaps at a job that you don’t really enjoy. 
Savings dwindle, debts may accumulate, and you won’t be able to achieve your 
personal and financial goals. Living within your means and continually growing 
your savings can give you more freedom, choices, and comfort with taking some 
risks (for example, changing careers, leaving your job to raise children, joining a 
start-up or starting your own company, and so on) that you may not otherwise 
feel as comfortable taking.

24      PART 1  Getting Started with Personal Finance
What It’s Worth: Valuing Savings over Time
Without a doubt, the amazing financial success stories get the headlines. You hear 
about company founders who make millions — sometimes billions — of dollars. 
Early investors in stocks such as Apple, Google, and Facebook have made gargan-
tuan returns. Who wouldn’t want to make a return of 100 times, 200 times, or 
more on his investment?
However, expecting to make such gargantuan returns is a recipe for disappoint-
ment and problems. (In Chapter 10, I discuss how to use the best investments in 
stocks, real estate, and small business to earn generous long-term returns.) The 
vast, vast majority of folks I’ve worked with and seen accumulate long-term 
wealth have done well because they regularly save money and they invest in 
somewhat riskier assets that produce expected long-term returns well above the 
rate of inflation, as the following sections discuss.
The difference of continual savings
Okay, so you get that savings is important. How you save is equally important. 
Continually saving money on a regular basis rather than putting away a one-time 
lump sum can also generate larger returns.
For example, suppose you earn (after taxes) an extra $1,000 this year at a side job 
and you decide to save that money. In future years, you decide it’s not worth the 
bother to do the extra work, so you’re unable to save the money.
Now, compare that situation to one where you reduce your spending so you can 
save $1,000 per year every year from your employment earnings. In both cases, 
assume that you put the money in a savings account and earn 3 percent annually 
(which has been about the long-term average). Table 2-1 shows an example.
That’s quite a stunning difference, huh? And that’s just putting away the small 
amount of $1,000 annually. If you can put away $5,000 or $10,000 annually, then 
simply multiply the figures by 5 or 10.

CHAPTER 2  Budgeting, Goal Setting, and Valuing Saving      25
The difference a few percentage points on 
your return makes to your investment
When you save money, you want to try and get higher returns. Bonds, stocks, and 
other investment vehicles (check out Chapter 10) typically produce much better 
long-term average returns than a savings account or a certificate of deposit (CD), 
which usually offer a measly 3 percent annual return over the long term. The 
trade-off with the stocks, bonds, and such is that you must be able to withstand 
shorter-term declines in those investments’ values.
If you put together a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds, for example, you 
should be able to earn about 8 percent per year, on average, over the long term. 
You won’t, of course, earn that amount every year — some years it will be less and 
some years it will be more. The following table shows how much you’d have after 
40 years if you got a 3 percent annual return versus an 8 percent annual return.
Investment
3% Annual Return 
over 40 Years
8% Annual Return 
over 40 Years
One-time $1,000 saved
$3,260
$21,720
$1,000 saved annually
$75,400
$259,060
When you combine regular saving with more-aggressive yet sensible investing, 
you end up with lots more money. Saving $1,000 yearly and getting just an aver-
age 8 percent annual return results in a nest egg of $259,060 in 40 years com-
pared to ending up with just $3,260 if you invest $1,000 one time at a 3 percent 
return over the same time period. And remember, if you can save more — such as 
$5,000 or $10,000 annually — you can multiply these numbers by 5 or 10.
With historic annual inflation running at about 3 percent, you’re basically tread-
ing water if you’re only earning a 3 percent investment return. In other words, 
your investments may be worth more, but the cost of other things will have 
increased as well, so the purchasing power of your money won’t have increased. 
As I discuss in Chapter 10, the goal of long-term investors is to grow the purchas-
ing power of their portfolio, and that’s where investments (such as stocks and 
bonds) with expected higher returns play a part.
Budgeting and Boosting Your Savings
When most people hear the word budgeting, they think unpleasant thoughts, like 
those associated with dieting, and rightfully so. Who wants to count calories or 
dollars and pennies? But budgeting — planning your future spending — can help 

26      PART 1  Getting Started with Personal Finance
you move from knowing how much you spend on various things to reducing your 
spending.
The following process breaks down budgeting in simple steps:
1.	 Analyze how and where you’re currently spending.
Chapter 5 explains how to conduct your spending analysis.
2.	 Calculate how much more you want to save each month.
Everyone has different goals. This book can help you develop yours and figure 
how much you should be saving to accomplish them.
3.	 Determine where to make cuts in your spending.
Where you decide to cut is a personal decision. In Chapter 5, I provide plenty of 
ideas for how and where to make reductions.
Suppose you’re currently not saving any of your monthly income and you want to 
save 10 percent for retirement. If you can save and invest through a tax-sheltered 
retirement account — such as a 401(k), 403(b), SEP-IRA, and so forth (see the 
section “Valuing retirement accounts” later in this chapter) — then you don’t 
actually need to cut your spending by 10 percent to reach a savings goal of 10 per-
cent of your gross income.
When you contribute money to a tax-deductible retirement account, you generally 
reduce your federal and state income taxes. If you’re a moderate-income earner 
paying approximately 30 percent in federal and state taxes on your marginal 
income (see Chapter 6), you actually need to reduce your spending by only 7 per-
cent to save 10 percent. The other 3 percent of the savings comes from the lower-
ing of your taxes. (The higher your tax bracket, the less you need to cut your 
spending to reach a particular savings goal.)
So to boost your savings rate to 10 percent, you simply need to go through your 
current spending, category by category, until you come up with enough proposed 
cuts to reduce your spending by 7 percent. Make your cuts in areas that are the 
least painful and in areas where you’re getting the least value from your current 
level of spending.
If you don’t have access to a tax-deductible retirement account or you’re saving 
for other goals in nonretirement accounts, budgeting still involves the same pro-
cess of assessment and making cuts in various spending categories.

CHAPTER 2  Budgeting, Goal Setting, and Valuing Saving      27
Setting and Prioritizing Your Savings Goals
You probably have some financial goals. If you don’t, you should begin thinking 
about some financial goals you want to reach. Because everyone is unique, you 
surely have different goals than your parents, friends, neighbors, and siblings. 
Although goals may differ from person to person, accomplishing financial goals 
almost always requires saving money. In this section, I discuss common financial 
goals and how to work toward them.
Unless you earn a large income from your work or have a family inheritance to fall 
back on, your personal and financial desires probably outstrip your resources. 
Thus, you have to make choices.
Identifying common goals 
of accomplished savers
As a result of my experience counseling and teaching people about better personal 
financial management, I can share with you the common traits among folks who 
CONSIDERING ANOTHER 
BUDGETING METHOD
Another method of budgeting involves starting completely from scratch rather than 
examining your current expenses and making cuts from that starting point. Ask yourself 
how much you’d like to spend on different areas (such as rent, meals out, and so on). 
This is called zero-based budgeting.
The advantage of this approach is that it doesn’t allow your current spending levels to 
constrain your thinking. Just because your current rent is $1,500 per month doesn’t 
mean that it needs to remain there. When your current lease expires, you could change 
your housing arrangements and perhaps find a nice rental you can share with several 
others. I did this when I was fresh out of college, and doing so enabled me to keep my 
rent low and save more money.
You’ll likely be amazed at the discrepancies between what you think you should be 
spending and what you actually are spending in certain categories. Take going out to 
eat, to bars, and to concerts, for example. You may think that spending $100 per month 
is reasonable and then discover that you’ve been averaging $250 per month in this cate-
gory. Thus, you’d need to slash your spending here by 60 percent to get to your target.

28      PART 1  Getting Started with Personal Finance
accomplish their goals. No matter how much money they made, the people I 
worked with who were the most successful were the ones who identified reason-
able goals and worked toward them.
Among the common goals for young adults with whom I’ve worked are the 
following:
»
» Making major purchases: You need to plan for major purchases. So if you 
have a future purchase in mind for a car, living-room furniture, vacations, and 
so on, you need to save toward that.
»
» Owning a business: Many people want to pursue the dream of starting and 
running their own business. The primary reason that most people continue just 
to dream is that they lack the money (and a specific plan) to leave their job. 
Although many businesses don’t require gobs of start-up cash, almost all require 
that you withstand a substantial reduction in your income during the early years.
»
» Buying a home: Renting and dealing with landlords can be a financial and 
emotional drag, so most folks aspire to buy and own their own home. Real 
estate has a pretty solid track record as a long-term investment. Sure, there 
are downturns just as there are in the stock market, but buying during 
such times may be good because real estate is more affordable then. (See 
Chapter 7 for more on housing.)
»
» Starting a family/educating kids: Having children leads some parents to cut 
back on work, which requires planning for living on a reduced income and 
facing higher expenses. And, if you have kids or are planning to have kids, you 
may want to help them get a college education. Unfortunately, that can cost a 
truckload of dough. Although you may never be in a position to cover all that 
cost, you’d probably like to be able to pay for a portion of it.
»
» Retiring: Retiring is a catchall term for discontinuing full-time work, or perhaps 
not even working for pay at all. While your retirement may still be many years 
away, planning ahead for retirement is important. You may enjoy working and 
thus may not have given retirement much thought, but most people eventu-
ally do want to retire, and you want to be prepared. I address how to do that 
in the next section.
Valuing retirement accounts
Where possible, focus on saving and investing in accounts that offer you tax 
advantages. Retirement accounts — such as a 401(k), 403(b), SEP-IRA, and so 
on — offer tax breaks to people of all economic means. In fact, lower-income and 
moderate-income earners have some additional tax breaks not available to 
higher-income earners. I discuss them later in this section.

CHAPTER 2  Budgeting, Goal Setting, and Valuing Saving      29
Consider the following advantages to investing in retirement accounts:
»
» Contributions are generally tax-deductible. By putting money in a retire-
ment account, you not only plan wisely for your future but also get an 
immediate financial reward: lower income taxes. Paying less in income taxes 
now means more money is available for saving and investing. Retirement 
account contributions are generally not taxed at either the federal or state 
income-tax level until withdrawal (but they’re still subject to Social Security 
and Medicare taxes when earned).
If you’re paying, say, 30 percent between federal and state taxes (see 
Chapter 6 to determine your tax bracket and get more details on tax-reduction 
strategies), a $5,000 contribution to a retirement account immediately lowers 
your income taxes by $1,500.
»
» Returns on your investment compound over time without taxation. 
After you put money into a retirement account, any interest, dividends, and 
appreciation (investment returns) add to your account without being taxed. Of 
course, there’s no such thing as a free lunch; these accounts don’t generally 
allow for complete tax avoidance. (Health savings accounts, which I discuss in 
Chapter 14, can offer complete tax avoidance. Also, though it offers no 
upfront tax breaks, the Roth IRA, which I discuss in Chapter 6, enables future 
tax-free withdrawals.) Yet you can get a really great lunch at a discount: You 
get to defer taxes on all the accumulating gains and profits until you withdraw 
the money down the road. Thus, more money is working for you over a longer 
period of time.

» Lower-income earners can get a special tax credit. In addition to the tax 
breaks I discuss previously, U.S. tax laws also provide a special tax credit, 
which is a percentage (ranging from 10 to 50 percent) of the first $2,000 
contributed (or $4,000 on a joint return) to a retirement account. Unlike a 
deduction, a tax credit directly reduces your tax bill by the amount of the 
credit. The credit isn’t available to those under the age of 18, full-time 
students, or people who are claimed as dependents on someone else’s tax 
return.
Married couples filing jointly with adjusted gross incomes (AGIs) of less than 
$62,000 and single taxpayers with an adjusted gross income of less than 
$31,000 can earn this retirement saver’s tax credit (claimed on Form 8880) for 
retirement account contributions.
»
» Matching money may be available. In some company retirement accounts, 
companies match a portion of your own contributions. Thus, in addition to tax 
breaks, you get free extra money (terms vary by company) courtesy of your 
employer. But you have to contribute some of your own money to get the 
matching money. If you don’t, you’re essentially throwing away money, which 
is never a good thing to do!

30      PART 1  Getting Started with Personal Finance
Dealing with competing goals
Unless you enjoy paying higher taxes, you may wonder why you’d choose to save 
money outside of retirement accounts, which shelter your money from taxation. 
The reason is that some financial goals aren’t readily achieved by saving in retire-
ment accounts. Also, retirement accounts have caps on the amount you can con-
tribute annually and restrictions for accessing the account.
Because you’re constrained by your financial resources, you need to prioritize 
your goals. Before funding your retirement accounts and racking up those tax 
breaks, you should consider your other goals, such as starting or buying a busi-
ness or buying a home.
If you withdraw funds from traditional retirement accounts before age 59½, you 
not only have to pay income taxes on the withdrawals but also usually have to pay 
early withdrawal penalties — 10 percent of the withdrawn amount in federal tax, 
plus whatever your state charges. So if you’re accumulating money for a down 
payment on a home or to start or buy a business, you probably should save that 
money outside of a retirement account so you get penalty-free access to the funds.
Saving When You’re Strapped
You know that putting aside some money on a regular basis is important, but you 
may wonder how realistic it is, especially when you’re burdened with a never-
ending list of bills or are starting out on your own. And, those six-figure-per-year 
jobs haven’t yet come your way! So what do you do? The first and most important 
thing is to work at paying down high-cost debt (see Chapter 3).
You can get into the habit of saving even when your income is low. Even if you can 
set aside just $5 or $10 every paycheck, you’re on the road. As you earn raises or 
bonuses, you can increase the amount you save. The bottom line: Put a little in 
savings on a regular basis.
You may consider getting a second job. You can put the money you make from this 
second job right into savings. Don’t even touch it. If you decide to get a part-time 
job, make sure that it’s something you enjoy so you don’t end up dreading it. For 
example, perhaps you enjoyed playing sports growing up and you’d enjoy putting 
that knowledge to work as a youth sports referee or umpire. If you’re strapped and 
barely making ends meet, you can also cut expenses. Chapter 5 has tips on reduc-
ing your spending.

Using Loans and Paying 
Down Debts
B
orrowing money and taking on debt is like using a chainsaw. With proper 
training and safety precautions, a chainsaw can be a useful tool. In the 
hands of an insufficiently trained user or when used in the wrong situa-
tions, this useful tool can do serious damage. The same can be said for borrowing 
money. Used sensibly, loans can help you accomplish important goals and boost 
your net worth over time. Unfortunately, taking on debt can also cause problems: 
living beyond your means, borrowing against your future earnings, and lowering 
your longer-term net worth. Too much debt and the wrong kind of high-cost debt 
can also cause personal stress.
In this chapter, I help you understand the best uses for loans and what debts to 
avoid. I also explain how to deal with student-loan debt and how to conquer the 
all-too-common problem of consumer debt.
Eyeing the Causes of Generational Debt
For a number of years now, it has been argued that young adults are under pres-
sures that lead them to dig deeper into debt than prior generations. The reasons 
cited for this generational debt have typically included

32      PART 1  Getting Started with Personal Finance
»
» High costs of college: Annual increases in the costs of a college education 
have far outstripped the increases in general prices of other products and 
services. The price of some private colleges now is nearly $70,000 per year!
»
» Stagnating incomes and job prospects: Most industries and companies 
compete in an increasingly global economy. And, the Internet has under-
mined and disrupted numerous retailers and other industries, causing 
incomes in those businesses to stagnate.
»
» High housing costs: The 1990s and most of the 2000s saw rising housing 
prices, which priced many entry-level buyers out of their local markets.
»
» College campus credit-card promotions: The availability and promotion of 
credit cards is a big problem. Credit cards are tempting to use during college 
when your income is minimal or nonexistent. On many college and university 
campuses, banks are allowed, through payment of large fees to the educa-
tional institution, to promote their credit cards. This practice and credit cards 
offering rewards are getting more and more young adults hooked on credit 
cards at younger ages.
»
» More temptations to spend money: Never before have so many tempta-
tions existed for spending money through so many outlets. In addition to the 
ubiquity of places to shop both nearby and online, people are bombarded 
with ads everywhere.
Most of these reasons for incurring generational debt are valid. However, take a 
look at both sides of the Internet revolution. While it’s true that the Internet and 
associated online companies such as Amazon have disrupted many businesses and 
industries, consumers who know how to shop wisely have often benefitted in 
terms of having more goods and services conveniently available to them at lower 
prices. Also, many technology-related companies have grown and expanded and 
been able to pay their workers well.
You may encounter some or all of these debt traps during your 20s and 30s. 
Remember that you’ll always face things in life that you can and can’t control. If 
you’re aware of these land mines and can discern the difference between what you 
can’t control and what you can constructively do to contain your spending and 
debt, then you’re on the right track. If certain venues or situations or people tempt 
you to overreach, then avoid them. The rest of this chapter can help.
Making the Most of Loans
Not all debt is bad. In fact, some debt can help you better your life and improve 
your financial situation in the long run. Taking out a loan for the right reasons can 
make good financial sense because you’re making an investment. Loans for your 

CHAPTER 3  Using Loans and Paying Down Debts      33
education, for buying or starting a small business, or for purchasing real estate 
can give you a return on your investment. Furthering your education, for example, 
can increase your income-earning ability. Borrowing to invest in a good piece of 
real estate or a small business should pay off over the years as well. Despite the 
potential, however, there’s no guarantee that you’ll earn a return above and 
beyond your loan’s interest costs. Money may get spent and borrowed on the 
wrong type of education or an inferior real-estate property, for example.
Borrowing and taking on debt for consumption — such as for buying a new car, new 
furniture, or electronics, or for a costly vacation trip — isn’t a good financial idea 
because such borrowing encourages living beyond your means. And the interest on 
this so-called consumer debt is generally not tax-deductible and carries a higher 
rate than the interest on mortgage debt. (Check out the section “Working Off 
­Consumer Debt” later in this chapter for tips on how to eliminate such costly loans.)
Dealing With Student-Loan Debt
Higher education can cost big bucks. And as you read this book, it’s possible that 
you may not even be done with this too-often-costly process. Whether it’s finish-
ing a degree or returning to school for some continuing education, you may have 
education expenditures, perhaps significant ones, in your future.
And, whether all those education costs are behind you now or not, paying off stu-
dent loans is probably in your future if you’re like most young adults. So, this 
section will help you to pay off those loans in a manner that best fits with your 
overall financial situation and that minimizes costs.
Tracking your student loans and 
making timely payments
You may have multiple types of loans with different loan servicers. It’s your 
responsibility to keep track of them, provide changes of address as necessary, and 
pay them on time. All your federal student loans can be found through the National 
Student Loan Data System (www.nslds.ed.gov).
Signing up for automatic electronic payments can knock ¼ percent or more off of 
the interest rate on your student loans. And, autopayment on your loans will keep 
you current on those loans, benefit your credit score, and eliminate the chance of 
getting hit with late fees.

34      PART 1  Getting Started with Personal Finance
If you fall on hard times (for example, you get laid off from your job) and can’t 
make a payment, communicate with your loan servicer and request a deferment. 
While your deferment request may be turned down if your circumstances are 
deemed not severe enough, you may qualify for forbearance, during which interest 
continues accumulating on your loans but you stop making payments for up to 
one year. If you fail to get in touch and communicate with your loan servicer when 
you’re having problems making payments, your credit report will show that you 
are deliquent on your loans and your credit score will suffer greatly (see Chapters 1 
and 4 for more about credit scores).
Prioritizing the payback of student loans
How fast you pay back student loans should be a function of a number of factors. 
First, if you plan on doing more schooling and possibly applying for any type of 
financial aid, it generally makes sense to pay the minimum possible on your loans; 
the more debt you have outstanding, the better positioned you will be to see your 
future education bills reduced. You can see your repayment options on the ­website, 
studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/understand/plans#estimator.
You should be aware of another quirky feature of federal student loans if you’re 
contemplating working for certain nonprofit or public-sector employers. The 
Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program may help wipe out your remaining 
­federal student debt after you’ve made ten years of repayments if you work for a 
qualifying employer such as the federal, state, or local government or a nonprofit 
organization covered under Section  501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code,  
or if you’re serving in a full-time AmeriCorps or Peace Corps position. See  
studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public- 
service for more information.
When weighing which student loans to pay back faster, you should consider the 
interest rate on your loans. If you have extra cash and would like to pay back your 
loans faster, start with the ones with the highest interest rate. If the overall inter-
est rates on your student loans are relatively low, don’t miss out on the tax ben-
efits you can earn by funding a retirement savings account, especially if that 
retirement account offers you free matching money from your employer.
If you’re sure you are finished with your higher education and associated costs 
and are debating paying down your student loans faster than required versus 
investing your extra cash, do a comparison of the interest cost on your most costly 
loans versus the likely investment returns if you were to invest that money. (The 
rules governing the tax-deductible amount of your student-loan interest are cov-
ered in the next section.) If your student loan interest is 4 percent and you are 
reasonably confident that you can earn, say, 6 to 8 percent by investing your extra 
cash, you could go for the investment.

CHAPTER 3  Using Loans and Paying Down Debts      35
Using education tax breaks
Whether you are finished with your higher education or not, be sure you under-
stand and maximize your use of the U.S. federal government tax benefits relating 
to those costs. Here’s a summary of key provisions you should know about:
»
» Student-loan interest deduction: You may take up to a $2,500 federal 
income-tax deduction for student-loan interest that you pay on IRS Form 1040 
for college costs as long as your modified adjusted gross income (AGI) is less 
than or equal to $65,000 for single taxpayers or $135,000 for married couples 
filing jointly. (Note: Your deduction is phased out if your AGI is between 
$65,000 and $80,000 for single taxpayers or between $135,000 and $165,000 
for married couples filing jointly.) Loans must be for qualified education 
expenses at an eligible higher educational institution such as a college, 
university, vocational or technical school, or other post-secondary educational 
institution eligible to participate in student-aid programs overseen by the 
U.S. Department of Education. The student using the loan must be enrolled at 
least half-time in a degree program.
»
» Tax-free investment earnings in special accounts: Money invested in 
so-called section 529 plans is sheltered from taxation and is not taxed upon 
withdrawal as long as the money is used to pay for eligible education 
expenses. Subject to eligibility requirements, 529 plans allow you to sock away 
$200,000+. Please be aware, however, that funding such accounts may harm 
your potential financial aid.
»
» Tax credits: The American Opportunity (AO) credit and Lifetime Learning (LL) 
credit provide tax relief to low- and moderate-income earners facing 
­education costs. The AO credit may be up to $2,500 per student per year 
of undergraduate education, while the LL credit may be up to $2,000 per 
taxpayer. Each student may take only one of these credits per tax year, and 
they are subject to income limitations. And in a year in which a credit is taken, 
you may not withdraw money from a 529 plan or take a tax deduction for 
your college expenses.
A number of so-called miscellaneous education and career-related expenses are 
deductible on IRS Form 1040 Schedule A. These include
»
» Educational expenses: You may be able to deduct the cost of tuition, books, 
and travel to and from classes if your education is related to your career. 
Specifically, you can deduct these expenses if your course work improves your 
work skills. Courses required by law or your employer to maintain your 
position are deductible if you pay for them. Continuing education classes for 
professionals may also be tax deductible. Note: Educational expenses that 
lead to your moving into a new field or career aren’t deductible.

36      PART 1  Getting Started with Personal Finance
»
» Job searches and career counseling: After you obtain your first job, you may 
deduct legitimate costs related to finding another job within your field. You 
can even deduct the cost of courses and trips for new job interviews — even if 
you don’t change jobs. And if you hire a career counselor to help you, you can 
deduct that cost as well.
Weighing the costs and benefits 
of ­education expenditures
If you are considering more higher education, it is imperative to weigh what this 
education will actually enable you to do in the workforce. Simply spending more 
on education may not be the answer.
Americans spend a lot of money on obtaining traditional college degrees. Yet, a 
good number of students fail to graduate with the education and training that they 
need to secure good, available jobs. A survey of those (especially young adults) 
currently unemployed and underemployed supports these concerns. There are 
good quality job openings, but the young adults available to work lack the proper 
training and educational background to do those jobs.
Simply put, too much money is wasted on higher education that is failing to train 
young adults to qualify for the best available jobs.
Just as government programs encouraged and enabled excessive mortgage bor-
rowing and contributed to a housing bubble in the late 2000s, the same is happen-
ing with higher education.
When considering an advanced or undergraduate degree, try as best you can to 
research the value of particular colleges and degree programs. There are numer-
ous resources for doing this. Among those which I’ve reviewed and found useful 
are the following:
»
» Forbes’ “Best Value Colleges” ranking compares and ranks colleges and universi-
ties based upon costs, school quality, post-grad earnings, student debt loads, 
and graduation success. Visit www.forbes.com/value-colleges/list.
»
» Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce produces 
“The Economic Value of College Majors” using Census Data to analyze wages 
for 137 college majors, the majors most likely to lead to an advanced degree, 
and the economic benefit of earning an advanced degree by undergraduate 
major. See cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/valueofcollegemajors.

Making the most of student loans, 
grants, and other financial aid
If you’re still in school or considering going back to school, a host of financial-aid 
programs, including a number of loan programs, allow you to borrow at reason-
able interest rates. Most programs add a few percentage points to the current 
interest rates on three-month to one-year Treasury bills. Thus, current rates on 
educational loans for students are in the vicinity of rates charged on fixed-rate 
mortgages (parent loan rates are a little higher). The rates are also capped so the 
interest rate on your student loan can never exceed several percent more than the 
initial rate on the loan.
A number of loan programs, such as unsubsidized Stafford Loans and Parent 
Loans for Undergraduate Students (PLUS), are available even when your family is 
not deemed financially needy. Only subsidized Stafford Loans, on which the fed-
eral government pays the interest that accumulates while the student is still in 
school, are limited to students deemed financially needy.
Most loan programs limit the amount that you can borrow per year, as well as the 
total you can borrow for a student’s educational career. If you need more money 
than your limits allow, PLUS loans can fill the gap: Parents can borrow the full 
amount needed after other financial aid is factored in. The only obstacle is that 
you must go through a credit qualification process. Unlike privately funded college 
loans, you can’t qualify for a federal loan if you have negative credit (recent bank-
ruptcy, more than three debts over three months past due, and so on). For more 
information from the federal government about these student-loan programs, 
call the Federal Student Aid Information Center at 800-433-3243 or visit its web-
site at studentaid.ed.gov.
If you (or your parents) are homeowners, you may be able to borrow against the 
equity (market value less the outstanding mortgage loan) in your property. This 
option is useful because you can borrow against your home at a reasonable interest 
rate, and the interest is generally tax-deductible on up to $100,000 borrowed. Some 
company retirement plans — for example, 401(k)s — allow borrowing as well.
Parents are allowed to make penalty-free withdrawals from individual retirement 
accounts if the funds are used for college expenses. Although you won’t be charged 
an early-withdrawal penalty, the IRS (and most states) will treat the amount 

38      PART 1  Getting Started with Personal Finance
withdrawn as taxable income. On top of that, the financial-aid office will look at 
your beefed-up income and assume that you don’t need as much financial aid. 
Because of these negative ramifications, funding college costs in this fashion 
should only be done as an absolute last resort.
In addition to loans, a number of grant programs are available through schools, 
the government, and independent sources. You can apply for federal government 
grants via the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Grants available 
through state government programs may require a separate application. Specific 
colleges and other private organizations (including employers, banks, credit 
unions, and community groups) also offer grants and scholarships.
One of the most important aspects of getting financial aid is choosing to apply, 
even if you’re not sure whether you qualify. Many scholarships and grants don’t 
require any extra work on your part  — simply apply for financial aid through 
colleges. Other aid programs need seeking out — check directories and databases 
at your local library, your high-school counseling department, and college 
financial-aid offices. You can also contact local organizations, churches, employers, 
and so on. You have a better chance of getting scholarship money through these 
avenues.
Benefits for military people
Special student-loan benefits are available to those who serve in the U.S. military. 
If you have student loans and then join a branch of the U.S. military (except the 
Marines), up to one-third of the amount you borrowed or $1,500 per year of ser-
vice, whichever is greater, may be forgiven. There’s a reimbursement limit of up 
to $10,000 for the Air Force and $65,000 for the Army and Navy.
Numerous educational assistance programs are available for those who serve 
while in college or go to college after serving. See www.military.com/education/
money-for-school for details by branch of the military, as there are many pro-
grams and they vary by branch.
Working Off Consumer Debt
Assuming you aren’t saving money, you accumulate consumer debt (credit-card 
debt, auto loan debts, and so on) when your expenses exceed your income. There-
fore, it stands to reason that to pay off consumer debt, you need to decrease your 
spending (see Chapter 5) and/or increase your income. Slowing down the growth 
of your debt can also assist. The following sections help you jump-start the elimi-
nation of your consumer debt.

CHAPTER 3  Using Loans and Paying Down Debts      39
Kicking the credit-card habit
It’s fine to use your credit cards as a convenient payment method — and possibly 
to earn benefits and rewards — if you pay your bill in full each month and don’t 
spend more due to having the cards. I’ve used them my entire adult life and also 
have reward cards that provide me with free and discounted airline tickets and 
hotel stays.
However, with their wide acceptance by merchants and their ease of use, having 
credit cards can foster living beyond your means by extending credit. That’s why 
I recommend that you cut up all your credit cards and call the card issuers to can-
cel your accounts if you have a habit of accumulating debt on credit cards.
You can manage your finances and expenditures without having a credit card. Now, 
if you can trust yourself to be responsible, keep one credit card only for new pur-
chases that you know you can absolutely pay in full each month. But if you decide 
to keep one widely accepted credit card instead of getting rid of them all, be careful. 
You may be tempted to let debt accumulate and roll over for a month or two, start-
ing up the whole horrible process of running up your consumer debt again. Even 
better than keeping one credit card is getting a debit card (see the next section).
If you’re not going to take my advice to get rid of all your credit cards or secure a 
debit card (discussed in the next section), be sure to keep a lid on your credit 
card’s credit limit (the maximum balance allowed on your card). You don’t have to 
accept a higher limit just because your bank keeps raising your credit limit to 
reward you for being such a profitable customer. Call your credit-card service’s 
toll-free phone number and lower your credit limit to a level you’re comfortable 
with. Also ask your card-issuing bank not to automatically raise that limit in the 
future when you’re deemed eligible for an increase.
Discovering debit cards: Convenience  
without credit temptation
Just because you get rid of your credit cards doesn’t mean you have to always pay 
by check or cash. Enter the debit card, which offers you the convenience of making 
purchases with a piece of plastic without the temptation or ability to run up 
credit-card debt. A debit card looks just like a credit card with either the Visa or 
MasterCard logo. Debit cards have the following characteristics, which are differ-
ent from credit cards:
»
» Deduction from your checking account: As with checks, debit-card purchase  
amounts are deducted electronically from your checking account within days. 
By contrast, if you pay your credit-card bill in full and on time each month, 

40      PART 1  Getting Started with Personal Finance
your credit card gives you free use of the money you owe until it’s time to 
pay the bill.
»
» Potential for overdrawing your checking account: If you switch to a debit 
card and you keep your checking-account balance low and don’t ordinarily 
balance your checkbook, you may need to start balancing it. Otherwise, you 
may incur an overdraft (an attempt to withdraw more money than is available 
in your checking account) and unnecessary overdraft fees (fees charged when 
you overdraw your account). Overdraft protection may be worth considering, 
but beware of the temptation to use that as an ongoing, high-interest credit 
line on balances borrowed, similar to a credit card.
»
» Shorter window of time for making disputes: Credit cards make it easier 
for you to dispute charges for problematic merchandise through the issu-
ing bank. Most banks allow you to dispute charges for up to 60 days after 
purchase and will credit the disputed amount to your account, pending 
resolution. Most debit cards offer a much shorter window, typically less than 
one week, for making disputes. (Despite widespread misperception, personal 
debit cards have identical fraud protection as personal credit cards.)
If you don’t already have a debit card, ask your current bank whether it offers Visa 
or MasterCard debit cards. If your bank doesn’t offer one, shop among the major 
banks in your area, which are likely to offer such debit cards. As debit cards come 
with checking accounts, do some comparison shopping between the different 
account features and fees. Check out Chapter 11 for more information about find-
ing the right bank for you.
Also check out getting a Visa or MasterCard debit card with the asset-management 
accounts offered by investment firms. Asset-management accounts basically are 
accounts that combine your investments, such as stocks, bonds, and mutual 
funds, with a transaction account. One drawback of these accounts is that most of 
them require fairly hefty minimum initial investment amounts — typically $5,000 
to $10,000. Among brokerages with competitive investment offerings and prices 
are TD Ameritrade (800-934-4448; www.tdameritrade.com) and Vanguard (800- 
992-8327; www.vanguard.com).
Lowering the interest rate  
on consumer debt
If you do have credit-card debt, you can slow its growth until you get it paid off by 
reducing the interest rate you’re paying. Here are some methods for doing that:
»
» Stop making new charges on cards that have outstanding balances while 
you’re paying down your credit-card balance(s). Many people don’t realize 

CHAPTER 3  Using Loans and Paying Down Debts      41
that interest starts to accumulate immediately when they carry a balance. 
You have no grace period, the 20 or so days you normally have to pay your 
balance in full without incurring interest charges, if you carry a credit-card 
balance from month to month.
»
» Apply for a lower-rate credit card. To qualify, you need a top-notch credit 
report and score (see Chapter 4), and not too much debt outstanding relative 
to your income. After you’re approved for a new, lower-interest-rate card, 
simply transfer your outstanding balance from your higher-rate card.
See my website, www.erictyson.com, for an up-to-date list of good, low-rate 
cards.
As you shop for a low-interest-rate credit card, be sure to check out all the terms 
and conditions of each card. Start by reviewing the uniform rates and terms of 
disclosure, which detail the myriad fees and conditions (especially how much your 
interest rate could increase for missed or late payments). Also understand how the 
future interest rate is determined on cards that charge variable interest rates.
Negotiating better rates from  
your current credit card
Rather than transferring your current credit-card balance onto a lower-interest- 
rate card (as mentioned in the preceding section), you can try to negotiate a better 
deal from your current credit-card company. Start by calling the bank that issued 
your current, high-interest-rate credit card and inform the bank that you want to 
cancel your card because you found a competitor that offers no annual fee and a 
lower interest rate. Your bank may choose to match the terms of the competitor 
rather than lose you as a customer. If it doesn’t, get that application completed for 
a lower-rate card.
Be careful with this strategy, and consider just paying off or transferring the bal-
ance without actually canceling the higher-interest-rate credit card. Canceling 
the card, especially if it’s one you’ve had for a number of years, may lower your 
credit score, especially in the short term. Just be sure not to run up new charges 
on the card you’re transferring the balance from.
Tapping investments to reduce  
consumer debt
If you have savings and investment balances available to pay off consumer debt, 
like high-interest credit-card debt and auto loans, consider doing so. Pay off the 
loans with the highest interest rates first. Although your savings and investments 

42      PART 1  Getting Started with Personal Finance
may be earning decent returns, the interest you’re paying on your consumer debts 
is likely higher. Paying off consumer loans on a credit card at, say, 14 percent is 
like finding an investment with a guaranteed return of 14 percent — tax-free. 
You’d actually need to find an investment that yielded even more  — around 
21 percent if you’re in a moderate tax bracket — to net 14 percent after paying 
taxes in order to justify not paying off your 14 percent loans.
The higher your tax bracket (explained in Chapter 6), the higher the return you 
need on your investments to justify keeping high-interest consumer debt. This 
discussion refers to investments in nonretirement accounts. Unless your tax 
bracket drops because of an extended layoff from work or from going back to 
school, withdrawing money from retirement accounts is costly because of the 
requirement to pay current federal and state income taxes on the amount with-
drawn, not to mention early withdrawal penalties.
When using your savings to pay down consumer debts, leave yourself enough cash 
to be in a position to withstand an unexpected large expense or temporary loss of 
income.
Paying down balances
If you’ve been reading this chapter from the beginning, you know that I discuss 
numerous strategies for zapping your consumer debt. Let’s take the discussion to 
a deeper level. How do you handle paying down multiple consumer-debt ­balances? 
It’s really pretty simple after you implement the advice I give up until this point in 
the chapter.
After meeting the minimum required monthly payment terms for each loan, I 
strongly advocate that you channel extra payments toward paying down those 
loans with the highest interest rates first. The financial benefit of doing so should 
be obvious. If you have one loan at a 20 percent annual interest cost and another 
at an 8 percent annual interest cost, you’ll be saving yourself a 12 percent annual 
interest cost by paying down the higher-cost loan faster.
I’m amazed at the wrong-headed advice I continue to see on this topic, especially 
on the Internet. One guru with no discernible training in the financial-planning/
personal-finance field advises that you rank your debt payments by their total 
outstanding balances and that you channel extra payments to those with the low-
est total balance owed. The “theory” behind this is that the psychological boost 
from paying down smaller debts completely will lead you to keep paying down 
your other debts.

CHAPTER 3  Using Loans and Paying Down Debts      43
In my real-world experience as a financial counselor, I’ve found folks to be intel-
ligent and more responsive to the psychological rewards of saving money. And 
you best save money by paying down your highest-interest debts first.
Getting Help for Extreme Debt
More drastic action may be required if you have significant debts or simply are 
overwhelmed with what to do about it. In this section, I discuss getting help from 
a credit counseling agency and the last-resort option of bankruptcy.
Seeking counseling
If you’re seriously in debt, you may consider a credit counselor. The ads for these 
agencies are everywhere. Although some of these organizations do a decent job, 
many are effectively funded by the fees that creditors pay them. Before you hire a 
credit counseling agency, make sure you do your research on the company.
Put together a list of questions to ask to find a credit counseling agency that meets 
your needs. Here are some key questions you can ask:
»
» Do you offer debt-management programs? In a debt-management 
program (DMP), a counseling agency puts you on a repayment plan with your 
creditors and gets paid a monthly fee for handling the payments. You should 
avoid agencies offering DMPs because of conflicts of interest. An agency can’t 
offer objective advice about all your options for dealing with debt, including 
bankruptcy, if it has a financial incentive to put you on a DMP.
This creates a bias in their counsel to place debt-laden folks seeking their 
advice on their debt-management programs wherein the consumer agrees to 
pay a certain amount per month to the agency, which in turn parcels out the 
money to the various creditors. Agencies typically recommend that debtors go 
on a repayment plan that has the consumer pay, say, 3 percent of each 
outstanding loan balance to the agency, which in turn pays the money to 
creditors.
Although credit counseling agencies’ promotional materials and counselors 
highlight the drawbacks to bankruptcy, counselors are reluctant to discuss the 
negative impact of signing up for a debt payment plan.
»
» What are your fees, including setup and/or monthly fees? Get a specific 
price quote and contract in writing. Avoid any credit counseling service that 
charges a high upfront fee before it provides any services. And watch out if 

44      PART 1  Getting Started with Personal Finance
the service tells you to stop paying your bills; it may take your money and run 
while your credit gets ruined.
»
» Are you licensed to offer your services in my state? You should only work 
with an agency licensed to operate in your state.
»
» What are your counselors’ qualifications? Are they accredited or certified 
by an outside organization? If so, by whom? If not, how are they trained? Try 
to use an organization whose counselors are trained by a nonaffiliated party.
»
» What assurance do I have that information about me will be kept 
confidential and secure? This information includes your address, phone 
number, and financial information. Reputable agencies provide clearly written 
privacy policies.
»
» How are your employees compensated? Are they paid more if I sign up for 
certain services, if I pay a fee, or if I make a contribution to your organization? 
Employees who work on an incentive basis are less likely to have your best 
interests in mind than those who earn a straight salary that isn’t influenced by 
your choices.
Considering bankruptcy
When the amount of your high-interest consumer debt relative to your annual 
income exceeds 25 percent, filing bankruptcy may be your best option. Like any 
tool, it has its pros and cons.
Bankruptcy’s potential advantages include the following:
»
» Certain debts can be completely eliminated or discharged. Debts that 
typically can be discharged include credit card, medical, auto, utilities, and 
rent. Eliminating your debt also allows you to start working toward your 
financial goals, such as saving to purchase a home or toward retirement. 
Depending on the amount of outstanding debt you have relative to your 
income, you may need a decade or more to pay it all off.
Debts that may not be canceled through bankruptcy generally include child 
support, alimony, student loans, taxes, and court-ordered damages (for 
example, drunk-driving settlements).
»
» Certain assets are protected by bankruptcy. In every state, you can retain 
certain property and assets when you file for bankruptcy. Most states allow 
you to protect a certain amount of home equity; some states allow you to 
keep your home regardless of its value. Additionally, you’re allowed to retain 
some other types and amounts of personal property and assets. For example, 
most states allow you to retain household furnishings, clothing, pensions, and 

CHAPTER 3  Using Loans and Paying Down Debts      45
money in retirement accounts. So don’t empty your retirement accounts or 
sell off personal possessions to pay debts unless you’re absolutely sure that 
you won’t be filing bankruptcy.
Filing bankruptcy, needless to say, has it downsides, including the following:
»
» It appears on your credit report for up to ten years. As a result, you’ll have 
difficulty obtaining credit, especially in the years immediately following your 
filing. (You may be able to obtain a secured credit card, which requires you to 
deposit money in a bank account equal to the credit limit on your credit card.) 
However, if you already have problems on your credit report (because of late 
payments or a failure to pay previous debts), damage has already been done. 
And without savings, you’re probably not going to be making major purchases 
(such as a home) in the next several years anyway.
»
» It incurs significant court filing and legal fees. These can easily exceed 
$1,000, especially in higher cost-of-living areas.
»
» It can cause emotional stress. Admitting that your personal income can’t 
keep pace with your debt obligations is a painful thing to do. Although filing 
bankruptcy clears the decks of debt and gives you a fresh financial start, 
feeling a profound sense of failure (and sometimes shame) is common.
»
» It becomes part of the public record. Another part of the emotional side of 
filing bankruptcy is that you must open your personal financial affairs to court 
scrutiny and court control during the several months it takes to administer a 
bankruptcy. A court-appointed bankruptcy trustee oversees your case and 
tries to recover as much of your property as possible to satisfy the creditors — 
those to whom you owe money.
Deciphering the bankruptcy laws
If you want to have a leisurely afternoon read, then the bankruptcy laws are defi-
nitely not for you. I’m here to help clarify the two forms of personal bankruptcy 
in case you’re considering taking this action:
»
» Chapter 7: Chapter 7 allows you to discharge or cancel certain debts. This 
form of bankruptcy makes the most sense when you have significant debts 
that you’re legally allowed to cancel.
»
» Chapter 13: Chapter 13 comes up with a repayment schedule that requires 
you to pay your debts over several years. Chapter 13 stays on your credit 
record (just like Chapter 7), but it doesn’t eliminate debt, so its value is 
limited — usually to dealing with debts like taxes that can’t be discharged 
through bankruptcy. Chapter 13 can keep creditors at bay until a repayment 
schedule is worked out in the courts.

46      PART 1  Getting Started with Personal Finance
The Bankruptcy Abuse and Prevention Act of 2005 contains the elements of per-
sonal bankruptcy laws now in effect, which include the following:
»
» Required counseling: Before filing for bankruptcy, individuals are mandated 
to complete credit counseling, the purpose of which is to explore your options 
for dealing with debt, including (but not limited to) bankruptcy and developing 
a debt-repayment plan.
To actually have debts discharged through bankruptcy, the law requires a 
second type of counseling called “debtor education.” All credit counseling 
and debtor education must be completed by an approved organization on 
the U.S. Trustee’s website (www.usdoj.gov/ust). Click the link “Credit 
Counseling & Debtor Education.”
»
» Means testing: Some high-income earners are precluded from filing the form 
of bankruptcy that actually discharges debts (Chapter 7 bankruptcy) and 
instead are forced to use the form of bankruptcy that involves a repayment 
plan (Chapter 13 bankruptcy). The law does allow for differences in income by 
making adjustments based on your state of residence and family size. The 
expense side of the equation is considered as well, and allowances are 
determined by county and metropolitan area. For more information, click the 
“Means Testing Information” link on the U.S. Trustee’s website (www.usdoj.
gov/ust).
»
» Rules to prevent people from moving to take advantage of a more-
lenient state’s bankruptcy laws: Individual states have their own provisions 
for how much personal property and home equity you can keep. Prior to 
the passage of the 2005 laws, in some cases, soon before filing bankruptcy, 
people actually moved to a state that allowed them to keep more. Under the 
new law, you must live in a state for at least two years before filing bankruptcy 
in that state and using that state’s personal-property exemptions. To use a 
given state’s homestead exemption, which dictates how much home equity 
you may protect, you must have lived in that state for at least 40 months.
Obtaining sound bankruptcy advice
No one should rush into filing bankruptcy. But you also don’t want to make the 
mistake of not considering the option if your debt has become overwhelming. If 
you’ve seriously investigated bankruptcy and want more information than I pro-
vide in this chapter, I suggest that you check out the book The New Bankruptcy: Will 
It Work for You? (Nolo Press), by attorneys Stephen Elias and Leon Bayer.
If you’re comfortable with your decision to file and you think that you can com-
plete the paperwork, you may be able to do it yourself. The latest edition of the 
book How to File for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy (Nolo Press), by attorneys Stephen Elias 
and Albin Renauer, comes with all the necessary filing forms.

CHAPTER 3  Using Loans and Paying Down Debts      47
Preventing Consumer Debt Relapses
Regardless of how you deal with paying off your debt, you’re at risk of 
re-accumulating debt if you’ve run up debt in the past. The following list highlights 
tactics you can use to limit the influence credit cards and consumer debt hold over 
your life:
»
» Replace your credit card with a debit card. See the section “Discovering 
debit cards: Convenience without credit temptation” earlier in this chapter for 
the details.
»
» Think in terms of total cost. Everything sounds cheaper in terms of monthly 
payments — that’s how salespeople entice you into buying things you can’t 
afford. Pull up the calculator app on your smartphone, if necessary, to tally up 
the sticker price, interest charges, and upkeep. The total cost will scare you. It 
should.
»
» Stop the junk mail avalanche. Look at your daily mail (email, snail mail) — 
I bet half of it is solicitations and mail-order catalogs. And then there are the 
endless telemarketing calls. You can save some trees and time sifting through 
junk mail by removing yourself from most mailing lists. To remove your name 
from mailing lists, including email, and to opt out of telemarketing calls, register 
through the website dmachoice.thedma.org/static/about_dma.php.
To remove your name from the major credit-reporting-agency lists that 
are used by credit-card solicitation companies, call 888-567-8688. Also, tell 
credit-card companies you have cards with that you want your account 
marked to indicate that you don’t want your personal information shared with 
telemarketing firms.
»
» Go shopping with a small amount of cash and no plastic. That way, you 
can spend only what little cash you have with you!
»
» Identify and treat spending addictions. Some people become addicted to 
spending, and it becomes a chronic problem that can interfere with other 
aspects of their lives. Check out Debtors Anonymous (DA), a nonprofit 
organization that provides support, primarily through group meetings. To find 
a DA support group in your area, visit the organization’s website at www.
debtorsanonymous.org or contact its headquarters at 800-421-2383.

Everything Credit: 
Scores and Reports
Y
ou may not have given much thought to your credit report and may not 
know what your current credit score is. If you find yourself in that boat, I 
want you to pay special attention to this chapter. You should care about 
your credit report and credit score because lenders universally use credit scores to 
predict the likelihood that you’ll repay a loan, and they’ll generally only offer you 
a loan after they’ve reviewed your credit details. If you already have a good grasp 
of your credit report and credit score, congratulations. You’re on the right track, 
but I hope to show you some additional steps you can take to help your situation.
In this chapter, I explain the difference between your credit report and credit score 
and how to improve them both. I also detail how lenders and others use your credit 
information. Finally, I explain how to keep from falling victim to identity theft, 
which can damage your credit reports and scores and cost you time and money.
A Primer on Credit Reports  
and Credit Scores
Your credit report and credit score play a vital role in your financial well-being. 
Therefore, you want to use them to your advantage. The following sections define 

50      PART 1  Getting Started with Personal Finance
credit reports and scores, explain how credit bureaus come up with them, point 
out how lenders use this information, and discuss how you can get the most from 
your credit during your young-adult years.
Differentiating between credit reports 
and credit scores
Credit reports and credit scores are different from each other, and you should 
understand upfront what they are and aren’t. The following sections spell out 
their characteristics in greater detail.
Credit reports
Your personal credit reports are a compilation and history (assembled by the three 
major credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion) of your various credit 
accounts.
Your credit report details when each of your debt and loan accounts was opened, 
the latest balance, your payment history, and so on. It specifies your track record 
of making payments in a timely or late fashion (including bankruptcies) and 
whether you’ve failed to pay off previous debts. Your credit report also shows who 
has made inquiries on your report when you’ve applied for credit.
Credit scores
Your credit score is a three-digit score based on information in your personal credit 
report. Because each of the big three credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, and 
­TransUnion) issues its own report, you actually have three different (although 
typically similar) credit scores.
FICO is the leading credit score in the industry and was developed by the FICO 
Company (formerly Fair, Isaac and Company). FICO scores range from a low of 300 
to a high of 850. Most scores fall in the 600s and 700s, with the median around 
720. As with college entrance examinations such as the SAT, higher scores are 
­better. (In recent years, the major credit bureaus have developed their own credit-
scoring systems, but most lenders still predominantly use FICO.) You generally 
qualify for the best lending rates if your credit score is in the mid-700s or higher.
The higher your credit score, the lower your predicted likelihood of defaulting on 
a loan. Conversely, consumers with low credit scores have dramatically higher 
historic rates of falling behind on their loans. Thus, people with low credit scores 
are considered much riskier borrowers, and fewer lenders are willing to offer them 
a given loan; those who do so charge relatively high interest rates on those loans.

CHAPTER 4  Everything Credit: Scores and Reports      51
Understanding how credit scores  
are determined
You have many credit scores, not just one. The reason you have multiple scores is 
because each of the three major credit bureau reports has somewhat different 
information about you and generates a unique score. But most consumers find, 
not surprisingly, that their three FICO scores from the big-three credit bureaus 
are fairly similar.
Credit scores change over time as your credit reports change. If you have a low 
score, the potential for change is good news because you can improve your score, 
perhaps significantly, in the weeks, months, and years ahead. The bureaus weigh 
current behavior more heavily than past behavior, though increasing your score is 
harder to do than decreasing it.
To have a credit score, you need to use credit. The FICO scoring system requires 
you to have at least one account open for a minimum of six months on your credit 
report and one account that has been updated in the most recent six months (it 
can be the same account).
The factors that determine your credit score include the following:
»
» Your payment history: Your record of paying bills determines about 35 
percent of your credit score.
Your score decreases with a recent negative mark (a late payment, for example), 
with a high frequency of negative marks, and with the severity of the negative 
mark (for instance, a 60-day late payment is worse than a 30-day late payment).
»
» How much you owe: This factor, which accounts for 30 percent of your score, 
examines the total amount you owe, as well as the amount by type of loan. 
The more you owe relative to your credit limits, the more adverse the effect 
on your credit score (most Americans use less than 30 percent of their 
available credit). With revolving debt (credit cards, credit lines), the greater the 
gap between your balances and your credit limits, the better. Also, paying 
down installment loans (for example, mortgages, auto loans) relative to the 
amount you originally borrowed will boost your credit score.
»
» How long you’ve had credit: Generally speaking, the longer you’ve had 
credit, the better for your credit score. This factor, which comprises 15 percent 
of your score, considers the average age of your accounts as well as the age of 
your oldest account.
»
» Your last application for credit: Applying for and opening new accounts, 
especially multiple new accounts, can reduce your credit score. This factor 
accounts for 10 percent of your FICO score.

52      PART 1  Getting Started with Personal Finance
»
» The types of credit you use: The FICO score rewards you for having a 
“healthy mix” of different types of credit (such as a mortgage, credit cards, and 
so on), although FICO is vague about what the best mix is. This factor accounts 
for 10 percent of your credit score.
Knowing the value of a good credit score
Generally, the higher your credit score, the better the loan terms (especially the 
interest rate) you receive and the more likely your loan applications are approved.
Over the course of your adult life, having a high credit score can save you tens (and 
perhaps hundreds) of thousands of dollars. Additionally, you can earn more money 
by being able to borrow money to make investments, such as in real estate or a 
small business.
Lenders aren’t the only ones that use credit scores. The following individuals and 
organizations/companies also use credit scores:
»
» Landlords: A high credit score can lead to the approval of your apartment 
rental application.
»
» Insurance agents: A high credit score can help you qualify for lower rates on 
certain types of insurance.
»
» Prospective employers: Significant problems on your credit report can cause 
some employers to turn you down for a job.
Jump-starting your credit score 
as a young adult
If you’re just starting out financially, you may not have a credit score yet, simply 
because you don’t have enough information on your credit report. Don’t despair. 
To obtain a credit score if you don’t yet have credit, the following actions help:
»
» Establish a checking and savings account (and even a debit card). Doing 
so demonstrates financial responsibility and stability.
»
» Get added to someone’s credit card as a joint or authorized user. Make 
sure this person is very responsible and shares your goal of keeping a terrific 
credit report and score.
»
» Have someone with good credit cosign a loan with you. I would only 
advise doing this with a relative, and only if the two of you have a long 

CHAPTER 4  Everything Credit: Scores and Reports      53
discussion about what could go wrong and have an agreement in writing to 
minimize the potential for misunderstandings.
»
» Apply for a credit card after turning 21 years old and when you have a 
job, because approval is relatively easy.
Just be sure to get a card with a low annual rate and no or a low annual fee. 
Consider a rewards card if the benefits you can earn are something you value 
and will use. And be careful not to rack up balances you can’t immediately pay 
off every month. Most important, don’t use credit cards if having them causes 
you to spend more than you otherwise would.
»
» If you can’t get a regular credit card, apply for a department store or gas 
charge card. Doing so is generally easier, but watch out for high interest rates 
and other fees if you can’t pay your bill in full each month. Alternatively, find out 
why you don’t qualify for a regular card; then work at addressing that shortcom-
ing and reapply when your credit report and credit score have improved.
»
» Apply for a secured credit card. This type of card requires that you keep 
money on deposit in the bank that issues the card.
For what it’s worth, I am not a big fan of college students having credit cards. The 
reason is that most cards allow charging of substantial amounts and may lead to 
overspending. In the worst cases, some college students end up with large balances 
at high interest rates upon graduation in addition to all of their student loans.
Having a debit card is a better choice, in my opinion, for college students because 
a debit card is attached to an account with a balance and thus prevents you from 
spending more than that amount.
Getting Your Hands on Your  
Credit Reports and Scores
Given the importance of your personal credit report, you may be pleased to know 
that each year you’re entitled to receive a free copy of your credit report from each 
of the three credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion).
If you visit www.annualcreditreport.com, you can view and print copies of your 
credit-report information from each of the three credit agencies (alternatively, 
call 877-322-8228 and have your reports mailed to you). After entering some 
personal data at the website, check the box indicating that you want to obtain all 
three credit reports, as each report may have slightly different information. You’ll 
then be directed to one of the three bureaus, and after you finish verifying that you 

54      PART 1  Getting Started with Personal Finance
are who you claim to be at that site, you can easily navigate back to www.
annualcreditreport.com so you can continue to the next agency’s site.
Your credit reports don’t include your credit score because credit bureaus aren’t 
required to include it by the federal law mandating that the three credit agencies 
provide a free credit report annually to each U.S. citizen who requests a copy. 
Thus, if you want to obtain your credit score, you generally need to pay for it. (An 
exception: You’re entitled to the credit score used by a lender who denies your 
loan application. For more exceptions, see the following section.)
Recommended websites 
for free ­credit scores
A few websites provide you with a free credit score without forcing you to sign  
up for something and/or provide your credit-card information. Here are some 
reliable sites:
»
» After verifying your identity on their website, Discover Financial Services offers 
your free Experian credit score with no strings attached or credit-card registra-
tion required. Visit their website at www.creditscorecard.com/registration. 
(Discover does have its own credit card, and it will pitch you that online.)
»
» The credit bureau Experian is behind the website FreeCreditScore.com, 
through which you can get your free credit score.
»
» Another free option to try is the FICO score simulator at www.myfico.com/
free-credit-score-range-estimator, which provides an estimate of your 
FICO score based on your answers to a series of questions about your credit 
usage and credit history.
Websites to avoid
Many websites, including the major credit bureaus, purport to offer you your 
credit score for free, but more often than not, to obtain this supposedly free score, 
you end up having to sign up for ongoing and costly credit monitoring. You may 
not realize that you’re agreeing to some sort of ongoing credit monitoring service 
for, say, $50 to $100+ per year. I don’t recommend spending money on those ser-
vices. Instead, for free, request your credit report from one of the three agencies 
every four months to make sure your credit information is accurate (I talk about 
reviewing your credit report in the upcoming section) and get your credit score 
from one of the websites that I recommend earlier in this section.

CHAPTER 4  Everything Credit: Scores and Reports      55
A number of web-based entities such as Credit Karma, Quizzle, and WalletHub 
claim to provide you with your credit score for “free.” These sites don’t give you the 
FICO credit score that lenders most often use. Instead, the sites, which do a poor job 
of disclosure, give you one of the credit scores developed by the credit reporting 
bureaus, such as the TransUnion VantageScore. As with Discover, you will be 
pitched a credit-card offer after obtaining your credit score. That’s how they keep 
these sites “free” for consumers seeking their score without paying for it.
In addition to getting a largely useless credit score at such sites, remember that 
you’re sharing with them an enormous amount of confidential information about 
yourself. How some of these sites make money isn’t completely obvious, but I can 
guarantee you that it involves finding ways (legal, hopefully) of tapping into all 
that information you give them. For example, a larger company that’s heavily 
involved in mortgage lending and other real-estate activities owns Quizzle, so you 
can guess why Quizzle would like to get its tentacles into consumers who are 
investigating their credit scores.
Scrutinizing Your Credit Reports 
to Improve Them
Because your credit score is based on the information in your credit report, the 
first step to improving your score is to review each of your three reports (head to 
www.annualcreditreport.com, where you can access your credit report informa-
tion from each of the three credit agencies). The following sections point out what 
you need to look for, what you can do to fix inaccurate information, and how you 
can improve your reports and credit score.
Identifying errors and getting them fixed
Carefully look through your credit reports for any potential inaccuracies. If you 
find any errors, you want to get them corrected quickly.
Follow these steps to ensure that you properly vet each report:
1.	 Review the identifying information to be sure that other folks’ informa-
tion hasn’t gotten mixed up with yours.
Look for the following errors:
•	 Names that aren’t yours
•	 Incorrect Social Security numbers

56      PART 1  Getting Started with Personal Finance
•	 Incorrect date of birth
•	 Addresses where you haven’t lived
2.	 Inspect the credit accounts for problems, such as
•	 Accounts that don’t belong to you
•	 Negative entries that don’t belong to you (such as late payments and 
charge-offs, which are amounts you supposedly borrowed that a lender no 
longer expects to get back from you)
•	 Negative entries that are more than seven years old
•	 Debts that your spouse incurred before marriage
•	 Incorrect entries due to identity theft or a credit bureau snafu that mixed 
up someone else’s information with yours
3.	 Examine the collection actions and public records section of your report 
for the following errors:
•	 Bankruptcies more than ten years old or ones that aren’t listed by a 
specific bankruptcy code chapter (such as a Chapter 7 bankruptcy)
•	 Lawsuits, judgments, or paid tax liens more than seven years old
•	 Paid liens or judgments that are listed as unpaid
•	 Loans that went into collection that are listed under more than one 
collection agency
•	 Any negative information that isn’t yours
If you identify any errors, you can submit corrections by using one of the forms 
for disputing incorrect information that accompany your credit reports. All credit 
bureaus are mandated to investigate and correct errors within 30 days. Your per-
sistence may be required.
Boosting your credit score
After you get your credit report cleaned up, here are some ways to improve your 
credit score:
»
» Pay your bills on time. The better your credit score, the more a late payment 
harms your score because such a change in behavior may indicate increasing 
financial difficulties.

CHAPTER 4  Everything Credit: Scores and Reports      57
To avoid making late payments, consider putting your bills on an automatic 
payment system either through your bank’s online bill-pay service or the 
company’s auto-pay option (if they offer one). If you’ve never used automatic 
payments and you’re skittish, try the system first with one company you trust 
the most. Another option is to put the charges on your credit card. Only do this, 
however, if you always pay your credit-card bill in full each month. Be cautious 
charging large bills on your credit card because using a big portion of your 
available credit can reduce your credit score. Also be sure that the companies 
you’re paying don’t charge an extra fee for using your credit card for payment.
»
» Pay down your debt. Paying down your debts over time is exactly the kind of 
responsible credit behavior that lenders want to see in the folks to whom they 
lend money. The lower the portion your balances are of your credit limits (try 
to keep them under 30 percent), the better your credit score will be. For this 
reason, you should avoid both consolidating debts and charging so much on a 
card in a month that you near the card’s credit limit.
»
» Avoid closing credit-card and other revolving accounts. Closing accounts 
makes your remaining balances look that much larger in comparison to your 
total available credit. Also, closing older accounts lowers the average age of 
your credit accounts, which reduces your credit score.
»
» Apply for credit sparingly. Applying for credit more frequently lowers your 
credit score.
Preventing Identity Theft
A study by Javelin Strategy & Research found that young adults are at significantly 
greater risk for identity theft than people in other age groups. Therefore, you must 
be proactive in preventing your personal information and accounts (bank, invest-
ment, credit, and debit) from being used by crooks to commit identity theft and 
fraud.
Victims of identity theft can suffer trashed credit reports, reduced ability to qual-
ify for loans and even jobs (with employers who check credit reports), out-of- 
pocket costs, and dozens of hours of time to clean up the mess and clean their 
credit records and name.

58      PART 1  Getting Started with Personal Finance
According to the aforementioned study, young adults are at greater risk for iden-
tity theft because
»
» Their use of social networking exposes confidential information. Younger 
people use social networking websites more heavily than others, and these 
sites promote the sharing of personal information. Those who use social 
networking sites are twice as likely to suffer identity-theft problems.
»
» They’re common targets of friendly fraud. Younger people are at far 
greater risk of friendly fraud, in which the perpetrator (family members, 
domestic workers, employees who have access to personal information, and 
so on) is known to the victim.
»
» They take much longer than older folks to detect fraud. Younger people 
are less likely to closely monitor accounts and credit reports that could reveal 
that fraud is taking place.
Here’s how to greatly reduce your chances of falling victim to identity theft:
»
» Don’t provide personal information over the phone, unless you initiated 
the call and you know well the company or person on the other end of 
the line. And don’t fall for incoming calls that your caller ID says are coming 
from a particular business, because folks have found ways to dupe caller ID 
systems. Suppose you get a call from someone saying he is with Chase Credit 
Card services and is calling about a problem with your credit-card account. If 
you have an account with Chase, ask the caller to provide you with his contact 
information and name. End the call; then get out your credit card, call the 
phone number listed on the back of your card, and ask the representative you 
speak with to verify whether the call you received was legitimate or not.
»
» Ignore emails soliciting personal information or action. Online crooks are 
clever and can generate a return/sender email address that looks like it comes 
from a known institution but really does not. This unscrupulous practice is 
known as phishing, and if you take the bait, visit the site, and provide the 
requested personal information, your reward is likely to be some sort of future 
identity-theft problem. Never click on links in emails, and only access your online 
accounts by typing in your bank’s URL or by using your own created bookmarks.
»
» Review your monthly financial statements. Although your bank, mutual 
fund, and investment company may call, text, or email you if they notice 
unusual activity on one of your accounts, some people discover problematic 
account activity by simply reviewing their monthly credit card, checking 
account, and other statements. Review line items on your statement to be 
sure that all the transactions are yours.
You can simplify this process by closing unnecessary accounts. The more 
credit cards and credit lines you have, the more likely you are to have 

CHAPTER 4  Everything Credit: Scores and Reports      59
problems with identity theft and to overspend and carry debt balances. 
Unless you maintain a separate card for small business transactions (or carry 
an extra card or two due to the rewards those cards offer you), you really need 
only one piece of plastic with a Visa or MasterCard logo. Give preference to a 
debit card if you have a history of accumulating credit-card debt balances.
»
» Periodically review your credit reports. Some identity-theft victims have 
found out about credit accounts opened in their name by reviewing their 
credit reports. Because you’re entitled to a free credit report from each of the 
three major credit agencies every year, you could review one agency report 
every four months to keep a close eye on your reports and still obtain them 
without cost. Is it necessary to review your credit reports that frequently, and 
do I personally do this? The answer to both of those questions is no! But, you 
may want to scrutinize your reports that often if you’ve had problems or 
otherwise have reason to be concerned about the security and integrity of 
your credit. (See the earlier section “Scrutinizing Your Credit Reports to 
Improve Them” for more information.)
»
» Freeze your credit reports. Many states enable consumers, typically for a 
fee, to freeze their credit information. Doing so puts you in total control of who 
may access your credit report. (But freezing also means that you have to give 
permission every time someone wants to examine your credit report, unless 
you place a temporary thaw on the account.) For an up-to-date listing of state 
freeze laws, including details on the small fees some states levy to freeze or 
then thaw your credit files, visit the website www.pirg.org/consumer/
credit/statelaws.htm.
»
» Avoid placing personal information on checks. Information that’s useful to 
identity thieves and that you shouldn’t put on your checks includes your 
credit-card number, driver’s license number, Social Security number, and so 
on. I also encourage you to leave your home address off your preprinted 
checks when you order them. Otherwise, everyone whose hands your check 
passes through gets free access to that information.
When writing a check to a merchant, question the need for adding personal 
information to the check (in fact, in numerous states, it’s against the law to 
request and place credit-card numbers on checks). Use a debit card instead 
for such transactions.
»
» Protect your computer. If you keep personal and financial data on your 
computer, use up-to-date virus protection software and a firewall, and 
password-protect access to your programs and files.
»
» Protect your snail mail. Stealing postal mail from most mailboxes is pretty 
easy, especially if your mail is delivered to a curbside box. Consider using a 
locked mailbox or a post-office box to protect your incoming mail from theft. 
Consider having your investment and other important statements sent to you 
via email, or simply access them online and eliminate mail delivery of the 

60      PART 1  Getting Started with Personal Finance
paper copies. Minimize your outgoing mail and save yourself hassles by 
signing up for automatic bill payment for as many bills as you can. Drop the 
rest of your outgoing mail in a secure U.S. postal box, such as those you find 
at the post office. (If you continue receiving paper statements, consider 
getting a shredder to shred documents you want to dispose of.)
MY STORIES OF IDENTITY THEFT 
(AND RECOVERY)
I can speak from personal experience when it comes to identity theft. It happened to 
me in my late 20s when a crook withdrew money from my checking account by using 
personal information that was stolen from my wife’s employer payroll department. This 
is but one of many ways you can fall victim to identity theft. In other cases, the criminal 
activity may develop with someone opening an account (such as a credit card) using 
someone’s stolen personal information.
In my situation, the bank immediately and without question reimbursed my account for 
the several withdrawals they had allowed from the fake Eric Tyson. The checking 
account was closed, and a new one was established. This created some short-term 
hassle for me, but ultimately, I wasn’t out any money from the identity theft.
More recently, someone tried to use my credit-card number to make some purchases 
at a liquor store hundreds of miles from my home. The person had created a fake card, 
and the transaction was turned down because the bogus card had an incorrect expira-
tion date. This led to me having to close that account and open one with a new number.
Finally, someone using some of my personal information tried to open a credit-card 
account with a department store. The attempt failed, and no card was issued.
So, you can see that identity theft attempts and “successes” can happen to anyone! My 
cases are typical in that nothing major occurred in terms of costs and hassle for me. 
But, in more unusual cases, more costs and hassles can be involved in cleaning up the 
mess.
So, if you’re ever the victim of identity theft, don’t panic and don’t despair. Odds are 
quite good you can recover without financial loss or major hassle. But, if your case is 
more complicated and challenging, review the good advice offered by the Federal Trade 
Commission at www.identitytheft.gov/Steps.

Proven Ways to Spend 
Less and Save More
W
hen I worked as a financial counselor, I was surprised at how often cli-
ents solicited my feedback on their spending, because a good portion of 
them were doing a fine job saving money. In addition to wanting to know 
how to save more to accomplish their goals, they also wanted to know how their 
spending compared to others’ and how they could best cut their own spending.
This chapter includes the same advice I gave my clients about spending money. 
How and where you spend your money is a matter of personal choice and priori-
ties, but those choices can affect the amount of money you have left to save. In 
this chapter, I present ideas on how to get the most from spending and how to 
spend less. (In Chapter 2, I discuss the importance of developing a savings mind-
set, as well as budgeting and spending strategies.)
Containing Housing Costs
Housing and its associated costs such as insurance, utilities, furniture, mainte-
nance, and repairs (for homeowners) are the largest or second-largest expenditure 
for most people. Keeping these costs (and taxes) under control, which I explain 
how to do in this section, goes a long way toward being able to save some money.

64      PART 2  Saving and Earning More
Reducing rental costs
When you’re a young adult and you don’t have dependents, living in a low-cost 
fashion is easier than it is later in life. The living arrangements may have some 
downsides, but young single people tend to have a broader range of rental options 
than those available to married people with kids.
The following sections point out what you can do to minimize your rent expense 
and associated costs.
Live with relatives
Yes, I realize that living with relatives won’t work for some families. However, if 
your folks or other relatives have the space and temperament to let you live under 
their roof, it can be a terrific way to keep your rental costs to a minimum. Just be 
sure to have some lengthy discussions first to set expectations and ground rules, 
raise concerns, and establish terms, including costs and rental agreements.
Share a rental with roommates
Living solo is a pricey luxury most younger people can’t afford. Doing so definitely 
has its benefits — you have more privacy and control over your home environ-
ment. Renting may sacrifice some of these advantages to living alone, but having 
roomies also has its pros. If you share a rental with roommates, the per-person 
costs should be substantially less than if you live solo. You must be in a sharing 
mood, though, to live harmoniously with roommates. They may help themselves 
to your food or shampoo, stay up late when you need to get up early the next day, 
or invite over inconsiderate friends. Roommates aren’t all bad, though, as they 
may brighten your social life.
Before you choose to share a dwelling with someone, make sure you can live with 
the person for the length of the rental agreement. If you break the lease, you may 
owe a hefty amount of money, which defeats the purpose of saving money with a 
roommate.
Be sure to have a rental agreement in place with your landlord and to have all 
renters listed in the agreement. Don’t allow others who aren’t listed in the agree-
ment to live in the rental, because you and the other renters could be on the hook 
for damage they cause and rent they don’t pay.
Move to a lower-cost rental
You may realize that you’re currently living beyond your means and you need to 
make some adjustments. You may have allowed your champagne tastes to exceed 
your beer budget when you went shopping for a home rental. So long as you’re com-
pleting your current lease, there’s no reason you can’t move to a lower-cost rental. 

CHAPTER 5  Proven Ways to Spend Less and Save More      65
The less you spend renting, the more you can save toward buying your own place. 
Just be sure to factor in all the costs of moving to and living in a new rental.
Of course, a lower-cost rental may be lower quality and not up to your standards. 
Don’t accept living in a high-crime neighborhood, a poorly maintained building, 
or a location that causes you to burn much of your free time commuting to work.
Negotiate your rental increases
Every year, some landlords increase their tenants’ rent no matter how good the 
tenant has been and regardless of the state of the economy. If your local economy 
is weak and the rental market is soft or your living quarters are deteriorating, 
negotiate with your landlord. You have more leverage and power than you prob-
ably realize. A smart landlord doesn’t want to lose good tenants who pay rent on 
time. Filling vacancies takes time and money.
State your case to your landlord through a well-crafted and polite note and/or per-
sonal visit. Explain how you have been a responsible tenant, always paid your rent 
on time, and cared for your unit, and convey that your research shows comparable 
rentals going for less. Briefly explaining any challenging financial circumstances 
(such as reduced pay from your job) may help your case as well. If you can’t stave 
off the rent increase, perhaps you can negotiate some improvements you value.
Get on the path to purchasing your own home
Purchasing a home always seems costly. However, over the long term, owning is 
usually less costly than renting a similar property. And as a homeowner, you build 
equity (the difference between the home’s value and what you owe on it) in your 
property as you make mortgage payments and as the home’s value increases over the 
long term. If you purchase a property with a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, the big-
gest expense of ownership — your monthly mortgage payment — is locked in and 
remains level. By contrast, as a renter, unless you live in a rent-controlled unit (which 
means that local government dictates and limits the percentage by which the rent 
may rise annually), your entire monthly housing cost is fully exposed to inflation.
During periods like 2006–11, the decline in home prices in most parts of the U.S. 
coupled with low interest rates made housing the most affordable it had been in 
decades. At the time, that was great news for renters looking to become future 
homeowners as well as those who simply wanted to rent a nicer dwelling. While 
home prices generally rise over the long term, buying during a home price decline 
can be a great way to get into the housing market when it’s having a “sale.”
Of course, each local market is unique, and if you happen to live in an area with a 
strong, diverse economy and little developable land or excess housing, your local 
housing market may be stronger and more expensive than others. Turn to 
Chapter 7 for more information on buying real estate.

Slicing homeowner expenses
If you own a home or are about to buy one, you can take many steps to keep your 
ownership costs down and under control without neglecting your property or liv-
ing like a pauper. The following sections are my tips.
Buy a home that fits your budget
Purchase a home that you can afford. During the booming real-estate market up 
until 2005, getting overextended with debt was pretty easy. You didn’t need a 
decent-size down payment or even have to have your income verified to buy a 
home if you made a larger down payment. Furthermore, interest-only loans 
allowed borrowers to shrink their mortgage payments by delaying repayment of 
any of their principal.
I was never a fan of such loans, which is why in our bestselling book Home Buying 
For Dummies (Wiley), my coauthor Ray Brown and I advise that the best way to buy 
a home is to examine your budget and financial resources before shopping for a 
home. As the real-estate market crashed between 2006–11 in most parts of the 
United States, some of those people who bought homes that stretched their bud-
gets lost their homes to foreclosure because they got in over their head, fell on 
hard times, and couldn’t afford their monthly mortgage payments.
Even if you can afford the monthly mortgage payment on a house you’re looking 
to buy, if you have too little money left over for your other needs and wants — 
such as taking trips, eating out, going to concerts, enjoying hobbies, or saving for 
retirement — your dream home may become a financial prison. See Chapter 7 for 
help in figuring how much you can afford to spend monthly on a home and still 
accomplish your other goals.
Get a roommate (and some rental income)
Owning a home may be more affordable if you have some monthly rental coming 
in (please see Chapter 7 for tips on buying and affording a home). Consider renting 
a bedroom (or separate/in-law unit if you’re lucky enough to have one) to someone 
who can pay monthly rent as well as possibly help with utilities. Through services 
like Airbnb.com, HomeAway.com, VRBO.com, TripAdvisor.com, Tripping.com, 
and so on, you can get an idea about what you may be able to charge in rent and 
find possible renters. You should also inquire with real-estate agents who are 
active and experienced in your local rental market, and consider websites like 
Trulia.com and Realtor.com for listing your rental.
If you decide to take on a renter(s), make sure you check the renter(s) thoroughly 
through references and a credit report, and be sure to discuss ground rules and 
expectations before renting to someone sharing your space. Vet prospective rent-
ers before agreeing to meet them or show them the rental. You don’t want to 

CHAPTER 5  Proven Ways to Spend Less and Save More      67
waste your time showing rentals to someone who can’t afford it, isn’t a good fit 
for your situation, or has a shady background! Also, ask your insurance company 
to see whether your homeowner’s policy needs adjustments to cover potential 
liability from renting.
Contain your utility costs
You can take steps to keep your utility costs down whether you own or rent a 
home. First, don’t waste energy, even if you don’t pay for it out-of-pocket as a 
renter. Landlords absolutely factor your energy consumption into future rental-
hike decisions. Paying for your own utilities should get you to consider wearing 
layers in the winter (you shouldn’t be walking around then in shorts) and not 
expecting your home to feel like a meat locker in the heat of summer. Adjust your 
thermostat to save energy  — allow it to be cooler than normal in winter and 
warmer than normal in summer — when you’re not going to be home for a while 
(for example, while you’re at work or away for a weekend).
Especially if you have to pay for garbage service, recycle as much as possible. Seek 
the replacement of old, energy-guzzling appliances and where possible, beef up 
your property’s insulation. Obviously, if you’re a renter, you have no control over 
these things, but you should certainly ask about utility costs and whether any 
appliances and insulation could be upgraded as necessary.
Cutting Your Taxes
Alongside the costs of owning or renting a home, taxes are the other large per-
sonal expenditure for most folks. Everyone gets socked with taxes when earning 
income and when investing and spending money. That’s the bad news — the good 
news is that you can reduce the amount of taxes you pay by using some relatively 
simple yet powerful strategies. The following two tax trimmers can help:
»
» Use retirement savings plans. To take advantage of such plans, you must 
spend less than you earn. Only then can you afford to contribute to these 
plans. Many of these plans immediately reduce your federal and state income 
taxes, and once money is inside such an account, the investment returns are 
sheltered from taxation. See Chapter 2 for more on retirement accounts.
»
» Reduce the amount of sales tax you pay. To do so, you must spend less 
and save more. When you buy most consumer products, you pay sales tax. 
Therefore, if you spend less money and save more in retirement accounts, 
you reduce your income taxes and sales taxes.
For more tax-reduction strategies, please see Chapter 6.

68      PART 2  Saving and Earning More
Managing Food Costs
Not eating is one way to reduce food expenditures; however, this method isn’t 
very realistic. The following culinary strategies can keep you on your feet  — 
perhaps even improve your health — and help you save money.
»
» Discover how to cook. Take a course and read some good books on cooking. 
Learn from those around you — parents and friends come to mind — who 
can teach you a thing or two! Consider that most people eat three meals a 
day, 365 days a year. That’s more than 1,000 meals yearly — a lot of eating! If 
you don’t know how to cook for yourself and how to do so healthfully, you 
may end up spending a lot more money on food and eating out — and have 
poor health to boot. Cooking meals for yourself doesn’t mean having to make 
something for each and every meal. You can cook in larger quantities than 
you need for one meal and put what you don’t eat in the refrigerator or 
freezer to eat at a later meal on another day. Making your own food saves you 
money, helps you enjoy your food more, and makes you more attractive 
to a mate!
»
» Learn about nutrition and prepared foods. No, this point isn’t contradictory 
with the first one about learning to cook. Everyone is busy, and buying 
prepared meals (including some frozen foods) that are easy to heat or ready 
to eat can make sense for some of your meals. But, you want to be sure to 
buy healthy, nutritious affordable food. Shop at stores like Trader Joe’s — to 
find one near you, visit www.traderjoes.com/stores. I also recommend 
nutrition websites like Eat This, Not That! (www.eatthis.com), also the 
name of their popular book series; www.AuthorityNutrition.com; 
www.LiveStrong.com; and World’s Healthiest Foods (www.whfoods.org).
»
» Consider store brands. Name-brand companies spend a lot of money on 
advertising and marketing, which you, the consumer, end up paying for 
through higher prices. You can save a considerable amount of money by 
buying the store brand (for example, Trader Joe’s or Whole Foods 365 
Everyday Value), which is usually the same quality (and sometimes the same 
product) as the name brand but priced lower.
»
» Buy in bulk. You can save substantially by shopping at stores that are able to 
sell groceries for less because of their operating efficiencies. Topping that list 
are wholesale superstores such as Costco and Sam’s Club. The catch is that 
you must buy most items in bulk or in larger sizes. An additional advantage to 
buying in bulk: It requires fewer shopping trips (hence less gasoline) and 
results in fewer instances of running out of things. You may be able to buy 
some of the foods you find you like in bulk online. Just be sure to order from a 
reputable online retailer that stands behind what it sells.

CHAPTER 5  Proven Ways to Spend Less and Save More      69
If you decide to buy in bulk, be careful with items that can spoil. Make sure 
that you buy what you can reasonably use (or freeze when necessary). If 
you’re single, consider shopping with a friend and splitting the order. If you’re 
looking for a store that sells more organic and natural products at a reason-
able price and in smaller sizes, check out Trader Joe’s.
»
» Kick the bottled water habit. Although tap water often does leave something 
to be desired, lab analysis of bottled water shows it has its own problems. You 
can save hundreds of dollars annually and drink cleaner water by installing a 
water filtration system at home and improving your tap (or well) water. Also 
consider pitcher-based water filtration systems like Zero Water and Brita.
»
» Pack your lunch sometimes. Eating out daily can rack up a lot of expense. 
Brown bag it sometimes.
»
» Spend carefully when dining out. Eating out can be fun and a way to 
socialize with friends, but keep in mind that you’re essentially hiring someone 
to shop, cook, and clean up for you! You can save some money when eating 
out by remembering these points:
•	 Eat out for breakfast or lunch rather than dinner. You can generally get 
the most bang for your buck then. And this may be better for your health; 
studies show that the meals you eat earlier in the day should be the more 
substantial ones — not dinner!
•	 Go easy on the beverages. Alcohol is especially expensive when dining out, and 
beverages in general are usually the biggest profit-margin items at restaurants.
Trimming Transportation Expenses
When you’re considering the cost of living in different areas, don’t forget to factor 
in commuting costs and wear and tear — not just on your car, but on you! Getting 
to and fro on a daily basis can get expensive if you don’t keep an eye on your 
expenses. Many people rely on cars for their transportation. Buying and operating 
a car can be a tremendous financial burden, especially if you borrow to buy or lease 
the car. You can control your transportation costs by following my suggestions:
»
» Opt for public transportation. Choose to live in an area that offers reliable 
public transportation, such as a subway or bus system. You can often 
purchase monthly passes at a reasonable rate. If you live close to work, or at 
least close to a public transit system, you may be able to make do with fewer 
cars (or no car at all) in your household.
»
» Ride your bike. During warmer months, consider jumping on your bike to get 
around. You can save money and get some exercise. Just be sure to be safe! 

70      PART 2  Saving and Earning More
Wear reflective gear and be sure your bike is easily visible. Stay off high-traffic, 
narrow roads and be on guard for bad drivers!
»
» If you must have a car, look at cheaper options than financing or leasing 
one. Having provided financial advice to many folks over many years, I can tell 
you from direct observation that spending on cars is one of the leading causes 
of overspending and undersaving. I understand that in some parts of the 
United States and Canada going without a car is nearly impossible, and I also 
understand that driving a car is a wonderful convenience that I have person-
ally enjoyed during most of my adult life.
But if you can avoid having your own car, by all means do so. You can also 
consider renting a car when needed if you don’t find yourself wanting to use 
one frequently. Or take an occasional taxi or use a Lyft- or Uber-type service.
The main reason people end up spending more than they can afford on a car 
is that they finance the purchase. When buying a car, you should buy one you 
can afford with cash, which for many people means buying a good-quality 
used car. Check out Chapter 19 for more helpful advice.
When shopping for a car, don’t make the mistake of simply comparing sticker 
prices. Consider the total long-term costs of car ownership, which include gas, 
insurance, registration fees, maintenance, repairs, and taxes (sales and 
personal property). And be sure to consider the safety of any car you buy, as 
driving is surely the most dangerous thing you do. See the National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration’s website (www.safercar.gov), which has lots of 
crash-test data as well as information on other car-safety issues. Buy and 
drive cars that have the highest crash-test safety ratings (five stars).
WHY WE BUY THINGS WE DON’T NEED
Whether the products are option-packed cars, high-end home appliances, or the latest 
designer clothing, marketers motivate consumers to buy on emotion rather than need. 
Marketers also play on insecurities, fears, and guilt and suggest that you can feel better 
about yourself and loved ones by buying their products.
This pattern begins at a young age — more than 6 in 10 young teenagers say that 
buying certain products made them feel better about themselves according to a study 
conducted for the nonprofit Center for a New American Dream.
You won’t be able to overcome this common and constant problem of overspending 
and accumulating consumer debt until you recognize these pressures and how they 
influence and corrupt your buying decisions.

Finessing Fashion Finances
The good news for you as a consumer is that in the fashion industry, global com-
petition has driven down prices for consumers. Here’s what you can do to look like 
a million bucks (on and off the job) while spending fewer of your bucks:
»
» Don’t chase the latest fashions. Ignore publications and ads that splash 
celebrities wearing the latest looks. You can enjoy pictures on social media like 
An eye-opening book is Pamela Danziger’s Why People Buy Things They Don’t Need. 
Danziger runs a consulting firm that advises large consumer-product companies on 
how to design products and convince consumers to buy them. Danziger correctly points 
out that many of American consumers’ purchases are discretionary. “The simple fact is 
that the contemporary American lives so far above subsistence, we have lost touch with 
the basic needs of life: food for nutrition, basic clothing, and shelter for warmth and 
protection,” she writes.
The central thesis of Danziger’s book is that consumer-products companies can induce 
consumers to buy costly products they don’t really need by appealing to consumers’ 
desires and emotional needs. “In today’s consumer-driven society, satisfying consumer 
needs has less to do with the practical meeting of physical needs and everything to do 
with gratifying desires based upon emotions. The act of consuming, rather than the 
item being consumed, satisfies the need,” she goes on states.
It really has been in the last couple of generations that we, as a society, have grown 
quite accustomed to buying consumer items on credit. “Spoiled the younger genera-
tions may be, but they are the consumers who express their wants, desires, and dreams 
in terms of needs and necessities because they have never done without,” says 
Danziger. “Need can wait, but want and desire drive purchases.”
Danziger and her consulting firm identify 14 so-called justifiers (I’d call them ration­
alizations) that consumers employ when making discretionary purchases. Improving the 
quality of your life; buying on impulse; replacing an existing item (for example, an older 
sofa), which leads to purchasing numerous related items (armchairs and end tables); 
and purchasing certain goods for status are examples of common justifiers.
The goal of consumer-product companies and their marketing staff is to persuade and 
cajole you into buying what they’re selling even if you don’t really need it. Remember 
this the next time the thought goes through your mind that you want to buy something 
that isn’t a necessity.

Instagram, but recognize some of those photos are nothing more than veiled 
ads to promote particular lines of clothing and brands. (Also keep in mind that 
the person wearing the clothing and the setting for the photo greatly influ-
ence how the clothing appears and appeals to you.) You don’t need to buy lots 
of new clothes every year. If your clothes aren’t lasting at least ten years, 
you’re probably tossing them before their time or buying clothing that isn’t 
very durable. Of course, when you enter an office job for the first time, you’re 
probably going to have to buy some new clothing. True fashion, as defined by 
what people wear, changes quite slowly. In fact, the classics never go out of 
style. If you want the effect of a new wardrobe every year, store last year’s 
purchases away next year and then bring them out the year after. Or rotate 
your clothing inventory every third year. Set your own fashion standards.
»
» Shun dry cleaning–required clothing. Stick with cottons and machine-
washable synthetics rather than wools or silks that require costly dry cleaning.
»
» Consider buying gently used fashion at consignment shops, vintage 
shops, or online. You can find great bargains at these places that others may 
have worn only once or twice and didn’t like.
»
» Look for deep discounts. Some stores have occasional big sales with major 
price reductions. And if you can wait until you’re well into a particular season, 
you can get items on clearance when there’s still time left to use them. For 
example, when stores are ready to put out fall/winter coats in August, they 
put their swimwear on clearance. Depending on where you live, you may be 
able to wear that new (discounted!) suit for several weeks and of course in 
future years.
»
» Minimize accessories. Shoes, jewelry, handbags, and the like can gobble 
large amounts of money. Again, how many of these accessory items do you 
really need? The answer is probably very few, because each one should last 
many years. Don’t purchase accessories and then not use them.
Relaxing on a Budget
Having fun and taking time out for recreation can be money well spent. However, 
you can easily engage in financial extravagance, which can wreck an otherwise 
good budget. Here are my favorite tips for getting the most from your recreation 
spending:
»
» Don’t equate spending (more) money with having (more) fun. Many 
movies, theaters, museums, and restaurants offer discount prices on certain 

CHAPTER 5  Proven Ways to Spend Less and Save More      73
days and times. Cultivate some interests and hobbies that are free or low cost. 
Visiting with friends, hiking, reading, and playing sports can be good for your 
finances as well as your health.
»
» Hang out with people who share your values and aren’t material. It’s especially 
important that you find a partner who isn’t a spendthrift and isn’t overly 
impressed with material things.
»
» Take vacations you can afford. Don’t borrow on credit cards to finance your 
travels. Try taking shorter vacations that are closer to home. For example, 
have you been to a state or national park recently? Take a vacation at home, 
visiting the sites in your local area. For longer-distance travel, go during the 
off-season and off-peak times and days for the best deals on airfares and 
hotels. If you’ve been disciplined about paying your credit-card bill in full each 
month, check out some of the better reward credit cards that offer benefits 
like free hotel stays and airline tickets.
THE BENEFITS AND DRAWBACKS OF 
CREDIT-CARD REWARD PROGRAMS
Credit-card reward point programs, where the cardholder receives points toward gift 
cards or travel purchases based on the amount the person spends on the card, are a 
relatively new phenomenon. Let me say upfront, I do have concerns about these cards 
and their programs for the simple reason that they reward spending! So, if they encour-
age you to spend more than you otherwise would, you need to factor that into any cal-
culation of the real net benefit such cards are providing you.
Also, to gain the most benefit from rewards programs, you should be the type of credit-
card user who pays his bill on time and in full each month. Otherwise, interest charges, 
late fees, and so on will more than wipe out the value of any rewards the card may 
offer you.
There are many credit cards that offer points or rewards. In fact, even within a given 
program, there are often options offering different sign-up bonuses, annual fees, annual 
bonuses, and so forth. So it takes time and some analysis to select a card that may be 
right for you. In order to do an informed comparison of these options, you should 
understand the underlying rewards program and how many points, for example, you

Taming Technology Spending
It seems there’s no end of ways to stay in touch and be entertained, as well as a 
never-ending stream of new gadgets. Although I enjoy choices and convenience as 
much as the next person, the cost for all these services and gadgets adds up, leading 
to a continued enslavement to your working full-time and earning more money.
Err on the side of keeping your life simple. Doing so costs less, reduces stress, and 
allows more time for the things that really do matter in life.
Keep the following in mind before you spend money on technology:
need to get a free night’s stay in hotels you’re likely to choose or how many points or 
miles you need for a round-trip airline ticket you’d like.
Also, some cards charge an annual fee whereas others do not. It may sometimes be 
worth paying an annual fee if the extra benefits on that particular card are worth more 
to you than that annual fee.
Currently, a decent number of rewards cards are out there that offer sizeable sign-up 
bonuses for all the various major airlines and hotel chains. Some people get those, take 
advantage of the offer, and then cancel before they get hit with their annual fee after 
one year. Then, they sign up for a different rewards card. Be careful though, because 
bank cards that have their own point system (for example, Chase Sapphire card) will 
zero out your points in their system if you don’t at least retain a no-fee or some other 
credit card with them. The Sapphire card recently was offering a 50,000-point sign-up 
bonus, which is worth up to $625 in travel through their in-house travel booking depart-
ment, Chase Ultimate Rewards. The card doesn’t charge an annual fee until the second 
year, so if you want to cancel then, be sure you’ve used your reward points by then if 
you’re not going to have another Chase card going forward.
Some cards that provide ongoing benefits may be worth holding over the years. For 
example, the Chase IHG Rewards Club card, which charges a $49 annual fee, gives you a 
free night annually at any of their hotels, some of which are quite expensive. Obviously, 
if you don’t use or value this benefit, it’s not worth paying the $49 annual fee.
As you shop for rewards cards, be careful and take with many grains of salt any “advice” 
you find on blogs or websites that recommend specific cards and provide direct links to 
sign up for those cards. The reason: These blogs and websites are getting kickbacks 
known as affiliate fees, typically in the neighborhood of about $100 per sign-up for new 
customers they reel in for the credit-card companies.

» Especially when it comes to new technology and gadgets, wait. You don’t 
have to be the first person to get something new. When something new first 
hits the market, prices are relatively high and the gadget inevitably has bugs. 
Wait at least a couple of years and your patience will be rewarded with much 
lower prices and more reliable products. If you’re considering buying a new 
cellphone, ask about buying the previous model, which is likely far less than 
the new model. Also, do your homework before going shopping. Consumer 
Reports and CNET (www.cnet.com) are useful resources.
»
» Be aware of how much you spend on your cellphone. Cellphones are a 
particular device that can encourage the wasting of money. Of course, if your 
employer pays for your cellphone as a perk or you can afford to buy the latest 
and greatest gadgets, you can skip what I have to say on this topic. In addition 
to downloads, text messaging, web surfing, and other services, you can find all 
sorts of entertaining ways to run up huge cellphone bills each month. Apps 
are especially problematic in this regard. Sure, the company behind most 
apps claims the app is free, but of course, you’ll face numerous tempting ways 
to make in-app purchases. Ask yourself whether you really need all these 
costly bells and whistles.
If you don’t use your phone a lot, consider a prepaid plan where you pay only 
for what you use. If you typically use a few hundred minutes per month or 
fewer, you should save money with one of these plans. Last but not least, be 
safe with your cellphone, especially when driving, and don’t hold a cellphone 
to your ear when talking because of long-term health concerns about the 
radiation emitted from these phones. Use the speakerphone or get an ear 
bud/headset for your phone.
HOW BANKS MAKE MONEY ON CREDIT 
CARDS
Banks make plenty of money on credit cards, which is why many banks love the busi-
ness of issuing credit cards. (And why they can “afford” to offer rewards programs.)
Banks make money on credit cards through the so-called interchange fees that they 
charge merchants for processing transactions made on the credit cards. Such fees 
­average around 2 percent of the transaction amount. So, for example, if you pay most 
of your monthly bills through your credit card, the monthly interchange fees that the 
card-issuing bank could be collecting could be $20 per $1,000 charged on your card. If 
you charge $1,000 per month ($12,000 per year), that’s $240 (2 percent of $12,000). 
If you charge an average of $,5000 monthly ($60,000 per year), that’s $1,200 annually 
in ­interchange fees!

Keeping Down Insurance Costs
Insurance is a big area — so big, in fact, that Part 4 of this book covers it in detail. 
The following tips help you minimize your insurance spending while making the 
most of your insurance, whether health, home, renters, auto, or life insurance:
»
» Use high deductibles. Each insurance policy has a deductible, which is the 
amount of a loss that must come out of your pocket before coverage kicks in. 
Higher deductibles can help to greatly lower your premiums. However, if you 
have a lot of claims, you won’t come out ahead by instead choosing a low 
deductible, because your insurance premiums will escalate.
»
» Obtain broad coverage. Don’t buy insurance for anything that won’t be a 
financial catastrophe if you have to pay for it out of your own pocket. For 
example, buying simple dental or home warranty plans, which cover relatively 
small potential expenditures, doesn’t make financial sense. And if no one’s 
dependent on your income, you don’t need life insurance, either. (Who’ll be 
around to collect when you’re gone?)
»
» Always shop around. Rates vary tremendously among insurers. For each 
of the major insurance policies, I provide you with a short list of the best 
companies to call for quotes and other cost-saving strategies in Part 4.
»
» Take care of your health. Exercise at least a few times per week and eat 
healthfully. Lose and keep off that extra weight if you’re now overweight. You 
only get one body and one life to take care of it.
Getting Professional Advice
Although your life may be relatively simple now, sometimes you may have to deal 
with new challenges, and you may benefit from a seasoned pro at your side. Tax, 
legal, business, and financial advisors can be worth more than their expense if 
they know what they’re doing and you pay a reasonable fee. Here’s how to get the 
most out of your spending when you hire advisors:
»
» Get educated first. How can you possibly evaluate an expert on a certain 
topic if you don’t know much about the topic yourself? Reading this book, for 
example, is an excellent thing to do before hiring a financial advisor. Printed 
and software-based resources can be useful, low-cost alternatives and 
supplements to hiring professionals.

CHAPTER 5  Proven Ways to Spend Less and Save More      77
»
» Use professionals only when needed — not constantly. Most people most 
of the time should hire a professional only on an as-needed basis. But be wary 
of professionals who create or perpetuate work and have conflicts of interest 
with their recommendations.
»
» Scrutinize and interview thoroughly before hiring. Do background 
research to evaluate each prospective advisor’s strengths and biases. Be sure 
to check references and conduct an Internet search to see what you can find 
out about the person. Check regulatory associations in your state for any 
citations or actions taken against an advisor.
Chapter 18 provides you more information about different types of professionals 
you can hire.
Handling Healthcare Expenses
When you’re young and in good health, you usually don’t give much thought to 
healthcare expenses and health insurance. But you have health insurance for a 
reason, and unfortunately, the cost of healthcare continues to rise faster than the 
overall rate of inflation. Use these tips to protect yourself:
»
» Shop around for health insurance and healthcare. Many different plan 
designs are available with a wide variation in costs. Also, like any other 
profession, medical providers have a profit motive, so they may recommend 
something that isn’t your best option, including extra testing that you may not 
need or benefit from. Don’t take any one physician’s advice as gospel. Always 
get a second opinion for any major surgery.
»
» Examine your employer’s benefit plans. Take advantage of being able to 
put away a portion of your income before taxes to pay for out-of-pocket 
healthcare expenses, especially in health savings accounts (see Chapter 14).
»
» Investigate alternative medicine and tread carefully. Alternative medi-
cine’s focus on preventive care and treatment of the whole body or person 
are pluses.
Just keep your antenna up for pie-in-the-sky promises and charlatans out to 
empty your wallet. Check with your physician before trying any alternatives.
»
» Kick your addictions. Smoking, alcohol, drugs, and gambling can cost you 
financially and emotionally. Be honest with yourself about the damage that 
excesses in these areas are causing in your life and take action now to get on 
a healthier path.

Taxes: Reduce Them 
or Else!
T
axes are likely one of your largest expenses along with your housing costs. 
So you should be highly motivated to reduce your taxes within the boundar-
ies of the law. And you need to understand enough of the tax laws and rules 
so you don’t get whacked with penalties and interest charges. This chapter can 
help you stay on the right side of the law and understand what strategies you 
can use to legally and permanently reduce your income taxes.
Understanding Taxable Income
Your taxable income is income on which you actually pay income taxes. For exam-
ple, your employment income and the interest you earn on bank savings accounts 
and certificates of deposit (CDs) are all federally taxable. By contrast, interest paid 
on municipal bonds is generally not federally taxable. As I discuss later in this 
chapter, some income, such as from stock dividends and long-term capital gains, 
is taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

80      PART 2  Saving and Earning More
Knowing your taxable income is important because it can help you focus on 
­strategies for legally lowering it. When doing your federal income tax return, you 
calculate your taxable income by subtracting deductions from your income. 
­Certain expenses, such as mortgage interest and property taxes, are deductible 
in the event that these itemized deductions exceed the standard deduction. (See 
the later section “Increasing Your Deductions” for more details.) When you con-
tribute to qualified retirement plans, you also get a deduction, just as you do if you 
put money into a health savings account.
Comparing Marginal Taxes
My purpose in writing this chapter is to help you legally and permanently reduce 
your taxes. Understanding the tax system is the key to reducing your tax burden.
As an important starting point, you need to understand the concept of marginal tax 
rates. Get out your most recent year’s federal and state income tax returns and look 
up the total taxes you paid that year. Many people don’t know this amount (per-
haps in part because it’s too often a depressingly large number) but instead can tell 
STATE INCOME TAXES
While this chapter focuses upon the federal income tax system and strategies to reduce 
those taxes, most of what is discussed will also help you to reduce your state income 
taxes, which the vast majority of states levy. Each state income tax system is unique so 
it’s not possible to cover them all here.
At the time this book was published, 43 states imposed a state income tax. Seven 
states — Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming — 
don’t have an income tax. New Hampshire and Tennessee only have a state income tax 
on dividend and interest investment income.
Does that mean that these seven states with no income tax are where you should move 
to avoid taxation? Not really, because as you might expect, such states make up for the 
lack of state income taxes through higher taxes on other things. For example, Florida 
and Texas have high property and sales tax rates, New Hampshire has high property 
tax rates, Nevada and Tennessee have a high sales tax rate, and Washington has high 
gas taxes. Some of these states also have a high cost of living. Finally, keep in mind that 
employers in those states know that employment income is not taxed by the state so all 
other things being equal, they can pay employees a little less due to that fact.

CHAPTER 6  Taxes: Reduce Them or Else!      81
me whether they got a refund. Remember — all a refund reflects is the repayment 
to you of some tax dollars because you overpaid your taxes during the year.
Regarding taxes, not all income is treated equally. This fact is far from self-evident. 
If you work for an employer and earn a constant salary during the course of a year, 
a steady and equal amount of federal and state taxes is deducted from each 
paycheck. Thus, it appears as though all that earned income is being taxed equally.
In reality, however, you pay less tax on your first dollars of earnings and more tax 
on your last dollars of earnings. Your marginal tax rate is the rate of tax you pay on 
your last, or highest, dollars of income. For example, if you’re single and your 
taxable income totals $40,000 during 2017, you pay federal tax at the rate of 
10 percent on the first $9,325 of taxable income, 15 percent on income between 
$9,325 and $37,950, and 25 percent on income between $37,950 and $40,000. 
Your marginal tax rate is 25 percent. Your total marginal rate includes your federal 
and state tax rates, as well as local income tax rates in the municipalities that have 
them. You can look up your state income tax rate in your current state income tax 
preparation booklet or on your state’s government website. Table 6-1 shows the 
federal income tax brackets for single folks and married couples filing jointly 
for 2017.
The marginal tax rate is a powerful concept that allows you to determine the addi-
tional taxes you have to pay on more income. Conversely, you can calculate the 
amount of taxes you save by reducing your taxable income, either by decreasing 
your income or by increasing your deductions.

2017 CONGRESSIONAL TAX BILL?
During the 2016 U.S. presidential race, then-candidate Donald Trump promised a major 
tax bill in his first year in office. As the 45th president of the United States, Trump and 
his team initially suggested that they would pass a tax reduction and reform bill by the 
end of August 2017 after repealing and replacing Obamacare so some cost savings 
from that action could help with the budgetary impact of tax reform.
At the time this book went to press in late 2017, Trump was finding that governing takes 
lots of time and patience and wasn’t as easy as he thought.
Corporate tax reform is long overdue. The United States is at a big competitive disad-
vantage. The United States has one of the highest corporate income tax rates in the 
world at 39 percent, which far exceeds the average of 22 percent in other countries.
What might corporate tax reform look like if it ever gets passed? As far back as 2010, 
then-Senators Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Judd Gregg (R-NH) proposed a bi-partisan tax 
reform (“Bipartisan Tax Fairness & Simplification Act of 2010”), which received strong 
support from think tanks on both sides of the political spectrum (for example, Urban 
Institute and Heritage Foundation).
In addition to a number of individual income tax provisions, the Wyden-Gregg bill, which 
didn’t go anywhere, addressed the high U.S. corporate income tax rate, which increas-
ingly is putting U.S. companies at a disadvantage, and simplified and reduced individual 
income taxes. Trump’s tax reform package is very similar to Wyden-Gregg.
Among the important individual provisions in the 2017 tax reform bill are the following: 
•	 Establishes three individual income tax rates (down from the current seven): 
10 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent
•	 Abolishes the individual Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)
•	 Doubles the standard deduction
•	 Repeals most itemized deductions while retaining the most popular itemized 
deductions (for example, mortgage interest, charitable giving, and possibly state 
and local income taxes)
•	 Retains preferential tax treatment of capital gains and dividends
•	 Enhances child and dependent care tax relief

CHAPTER 6  Taxes: Reduce Them or Else!      83
Reducing Taxes on Work Income
When you earn money from work, you’re supposed to pay income tax on that 
income. Some people avoid taxes by illegal means, such as by not reporting such 
income (doing that isn’t really possible if you’re getting a regular paycheck from 
an employer), but you can very well end up paying a heap of penalties and extra 
interest charges on top of the taxes you owe. And you may even get tossed in jail. 
This section focuses on the legal ways to reduce your income taxes on work-
related income.
Contributing to retirement plans
One way you can exclude money from your taxable income is by tucking it away in 
employer-based retirement plans, such as 401(k) or 403(b) accounts, or self-
employed retirement plans, such as an SEP-IRA or Solo 401(k). Besides reducing 
your taxes, retirement plans help you build a nest egg so you don’t have to work 
for the rest of your life.
If your combined federal and state marginal tax rate (see the earlier “Comparing 
Marginal Taxes” section) is, say, 25 percent and you contribute $1,000 to one of 
these plans, you reduce your federal and state taxes by $250. Contribute another 
$1,000, and your taxes drop another $250 (as long as you’re still in the same 
­marginal tax rate). And when your money is inside a retirement account, it can 
compound and grow without taxation. (Some employers offer an additional perk: 
free matching money simply for your contributing.)
Single taxpayers with an adjusted gross income (AGI) of less than $31,000 and 
married couples filing jointly with an AGI of less than $62,000 can earn a tax 
credit (claimed on Form 8880, “Credit for Qualified Retirement Savings Contribu-
tions”) for retirement account contributions. (AGI is your total wage, interest, 
dividend, and all other income minus retirement account contributions, self-
employed health insurance, alimony paid, and losses from investments.) Unlike a 
Proposed corporate provisions include the following:
•	 Establishes a flat corporate income tax rate of 15 percent to perhaps as high as 
20 percent
•	 Abolishes the corporate AMT (corporations will be able to claim their existing AMT 
credits over time)
•	 Repeals a hodgepodge of tax deductions, exclusions, and credits

84      PART 2  Saving and Earning More
deduction, a tax credit directly reduces your tax bill by the amount of the credit. 
This credit, which is detailed in Table 6-2, is a percentage of the first $2,000 you 
contribute to a retirement plan (or $4,000 on a joint return). The credit isn’t 
available to those individuals under the age of 18, full-time students, or people 
who are claimed as dependents on someone else’s tax return.
Many people miss this great opportunity for reducing their taxes because they 
spend all (or too much of) their current employment income and, therefore, have 
little or nothing left to put into a retirement account. If you’re in this predica-
ment, you need to reduce your spending before you can contribute money to a 
retirement plan. (See Chapters 2 and 5 for advice on decreasing your spending.)
If your employer doesn’t offer the option of saving money through a retirement 
plan, ask the benefits and human resource(s) person/department whether the 
company would consider offering such a plan. Alternatively, consider contributing 
to an individual retirement account (IRA), which may or may not be tax-deductible, 
depending on your circumstances. You should first maximize contributions to 
the  previously mentioned tax-deductible accounts. (See Chapter  2 for more on 
retirement accounts.)
However, a retirement account may not be the wisest decision for you at this time. 
Good reasons not to fund a retirement account include:
»
» You have a specific, shorter-term goal. Such goals include saving to 
purchase a home or starting a business that necessitates having access to 
your money.
»
» You’re temporarily in a very low tax bracket. This could happen, for 
example, if you lose your job for an extended period of time or are in school. 
(In these cases, you’re unlikely to have lots of spare money to contribute to a 
retirement account anyway!) If you have some employment income, consider 
the Roth IRA (see Chapter 2).

Using health savings accounts
You can reduce your taxable income and sock away money for future healthcare 
expenses by taking advantage of a health savings account (HSA). In fact, HSAs can 
offer superior tax savings versus retirement accounts because in addition to 
­providing upfront tax breaks on contributions and tax-free accumulation of 
investment earnings, you can also withdraw money from HSAs tax-free so long as 
the money is used for healthcare costs. No other retirement accounts offer this 
triple tax-free benefit. For more details on HSAs, see Chapter 14.
AVOIDING RETIREMENT ACCOUNT 
WITHDRAWAL PENALTIES
Many young people object to funding retirement accounts because retirement seems 
so far away and because the money in retirement accounts, once contributed, is only 
accessible subject to penalties (10 percent federal plus whatever your state charges).
However, if you do put money into a retirement account, you can avoid these early-
withdrawal penalties under several different circumstances:
•	 You can make penalty-free withdrawals from individual retirement accounts for a 
first-time home purchase (limit of $10,000).
•	 You can withdraw from your account to help cover higher educational expenses for 
you, your spouse, your children, or your grandchildren.
•	 If you have major medical expenses (exceeding 10 percent of your income) or a dis-
ability, you may be exempt from the penalties under certain conditions.
•	 If you get into a financial pinch while you’re still employed, be aware that some 
company retirement plans allow you to borrow against your balance. This tactic is 
like loaning money to yourself — the interest payments go back into your account. 
(Important note: If you fail to repay the loan, it’s classified as a withdrawal and sub-
ject to early withdrawal penalties.)
•	 If you lose your job and withdraw retirement account money simply because you 
need it to live on, the penalties do apply. However, if you’re not working and you’re 
earning so little income that you need to tap your retirement account, you surely 
fall into a low tax bracket. The lower income taxes you pay (when compared to the 
taxes you would have paid on that money had you not sheltered it in a retirement 
account in the first place) should make up for most or all of the penalty.
•	 The IRS allows you to withdraw money before age 59½ if you do so in equal, annual 
installments based on your life expectancy. The IRS has a table for looking up your 
life expectancy.

Deducting self-employment expenses
When you’re self-employed, you can deduct a multitude of expenses from your 
income before calculating the tax you owe. Some self-employed folks don’t take 
all the deductions they’re eligible for. In some cases, people simply aren’t aware 
of the wonderful world of deductions. Others are worried that large deductions 
will increase the risk of an audit.
When you’re self-employed, going it alone when dealing with your taxes is usu-
ally a mistake. You must educate yourself to make the tax laws work for you rather 
than against you. Spend some time finding out more about tax deductions; you’ll 
be convinced that taking full advantage of your eligible deductions makes sense 
and saves you money. Hiring tax help is well worth your while, and recordkeeping 
is essential.
More items than you expect are deductible. If you buy a computer or office furni-
ture, you can deduct those expenses. (Sometimes they need to be gradually 
deducted, or depreciated, over time.) Salaries for employees, the cost of office sup-
plies, rent or mortgage interest for your office space, and phone/communications 
expenses are also generally deductible.
As a self-employed individual, you’re responsible for the accurate and timely 
filing of all taxes owed on your income and employment taxes on your employ-
ees (if you have them) in order to avoid penalties. You need to make estimated 
tax payments on a quarterly basis. To pay taxes on your income, use Form 
1040-ES.  You can obtain this form, along with instructions, from the IRS 
(800-829-3676; www.irs.gov). The form comes with an estimated tax work-
sheet and four quarterly tax payment coupons. If you want to find the rules for 
withholding and submitting taxes from employees’ paychecks, ask the IRS for 
Form 941, and for unemployment insurance, look for Form 940. And unless 
you’re lucky enough to live in a state with no income taxes, you need to call your 
state’s department of revenue or a similar entity for your state’s estimated 
income tax package. Another alternative is to hire a payroll firm, such as ADP or 
Paychex, to do all this work for you.
When you pay with cash, following the paper trail for all the money you spent can 
be hard to do (for you and for the IRS, in the event you’re ever audited). At the end 
of the year, how are you going to remember how much you spent for parking or 
client meals if you fail to keep a record? How will you survive an IRS audit without 
proper documentation? Small business software (for example, QuickBooks) or 
apps can assist you with expense and cash tracking.
Debit cards are accepted most places and provide convenient documentation. Ditto 
for credit cards. Be careful about getting a card in your business’s name, though, 
because some banks don’t offer protection against fraudulent use of business cards.

If your children, spouse, or other relatives help with some aspect of your business, 
consider paying them for the work. Besides showing them that you value their 
work, this practice may reduce your family’s tax liability. For example, children 
are usually in a lower tax bracket. By shifting some of your income to your child, 
you cut your tax bill.
Increasing Your Deductions
Deductions are amounts you subtract from your adjusted gross income before cal-
culating the tax you owe. The IRS gives you two methods for determining your 
total deductions and allows you to select the method that leads to greater deduc-
tions and lower taxes.
The two methods are as follows:
»
» Standard deduction: If you have a relatively simple financial life, taking the 
standard deduction is generally the better option. Those who are blind or who 
are age 65 or older get a slightly higher standard deduction.
»
» Itemized deduction: Itemizing your deductions on Schedule A of IRS Form 
1040 is the other method for determining your allowable deductions. 
Itemizing tends to make more sense for those who earn a high income, own 
their own home (mortgage interest and property taxes are itemized deduc-
tions), and/or have unusually large expenses from medical bills, charitable 
contributions, or loss due to theft or catastrophe.
If you don’t currently itemize, you may be surprised to discover that your state 
income taxes can be itemized. Also, when you pay a fee to the state to register and 
license your car, you can itemize a portion of the expenditure as a deduction (on 
Schedule A, “Personal Property Taxes”). The IRS allows you to deduct the part of 
the fee that relates to the value of your car. The state organization that collects the 
fee should be able to tell you what portion of the fee is deductible. (Some states 
detail on the invoice what portion of the fee is tax-deductible.)
Several states have state disability insurance funds. If you pay into these funds 
(check your W-2), you can deduct your payments as state and local income taxes 
on Line 5 of Schedule A. You may also claim a deduction on this line for payments 
you make into your state’s unemployment compensation fund.
A number of miscellaneous expenses are also deductible on Schedule A to the 
extent that they exceed 2 percent of your AGI (adjusted gross income). Most of 
these expenses relate to your job or career and the management of your finances:

88      PART 2  Saving and Earning More
»
» Work-related educational expenses: You may be able to deduct the cost of 
tuition, books, and travel to and from classes if your education is related to 
your career. Specifically, you can deduct these expenses if your course work 
improves your work skills. Courses required by law or your employer to 
maintain your position are deductible. Continuing education classes for 
professionals may also be deductible. Note: Educational expenses that lead 
to your moving into a new field or career are not deductible.
»
» Expenses for job searches and career counseling: After you obtain your first 
job, you may deduct legitimate costs related to finding another job within your 
field. You can even deduct the cost of courses and trips for job interviews — 
even if you don’t change jobs. And if you hire a career counselor to help you, 
you can deduct that cost as well.
»
» Expenses related to your job that aren’t reimbursed: When you pay for 
your own subscriptions to trade journals to keep up with your field, or you 
buy a new desk and chair to ease back pain, you can deduct these costs. If 
your job requires you to wear special clothes or a uniform (for example, you’re 
an EMT), you can deduct the cost of purchasing and cleaning these clothes, as 
long as they aren’t suitable for wearing outside of work. When you buy a 
computer for use outside the office at your own expense, you may be able to 
deduct the cost if the computer is for the convenience of your employer, is a 
condition of your employment, and is used more than half the time for 
business. Union dues and membership fees for professional organizations are 
also deductible.
»
» Investment and tax-related expenses: Investment and tax-advisor fees are 
deductible, as are subscription costs for investment-related publications. 
Accounting fees for preparing your tax return or conducting tax planning 
during the year are deductible; legal fees related to your taxes are also 
deductible. If you purchase a home computer to track your investments or 
prepare your taxes, you can deduct that expense, too.
Lowering Investment Income Taxes
The distributions and profits on investments that you hold outside of tax-sheltered 
retirement accounts are exposed to taxation. Interest, dividends, and capital gains 
(profits from the sale of an investment at a price that’s higher than the purchase 
price) are all taxed. The good news: You can take action to reduce the taxes in 
those accounts. This section explains some of the best methods for doing so.

CHAPTER 6  Taxes: Reduce Them or Else!      89
Investing in tax-free money market 
funds and bonds
When you’re in a high tax bracket, you may find that you come out ahead with 
tax-free investments. Tax-free investments pay investment income, which is 
exempt from federal tax, state tax, or both. Tax-free investments yield less than 
comparable investments that produce taxable income. But because of the differ-
ence in taxes, the earnings from tax-free investments can end up being greater 
than what you’re left with from taxable investments.
Two tax-free options include the following. (See Chapter 10 for more details on 
tax-free investments.)
»
» Money market funds: Tax-free money market funds can be a better alterna-
tive to bank savings accounts, the interest on which is subject to taxation.
»
» Bonds: Likewise, tax-free bonds are intended to be longer-term investments 
that pay tax-free interest, so they may be a better, more tax-efficient invest-
ment option for you than bank certificates of deposit, Treasury bills and 
bonds, and other investments that produce taxable income.
Selecting other tax-friendly investments
Too often, when selecting investments, people mistakenly focus on past rates of 
return, before-tax. The past, of course, is no guarantee of the future. Selecting an 
investment with a reportedly high rate of return without considering tax conse-
quences is an even worse mistake because what you get to keep, after taxes, is 
what matters.
I call investments that appreciate in value and don’t distribute much in the way of 
highly taxed income tax-friendly. (Some in the investment business use the term 
tax-efficient.) See Chapter  10 for more information on tax-friendly stocks and 
stock mutual funds.
Real estate is one of the few areas with privileged status in the tax code. In addi-
tion to deductions allowed for mortgage interest and property taxes, you can 
depreciate rental property to reduce your taxable income. Depreciation is a special 
tax deduction allowed for the gradual wear and tear on rental real estate. When 
you sell investment real estate, you may be eligible to conduct a tax-free exchange 
into a replacement rental property.

90      PART 2  Saving and Earning More
Making your profits long term
When you buy growth investments such as stocks and real estate, you should do 
so for the long term. The tax system rewards your patience with lower tax rates on 
your profits.
When you’re able to hold on to a nonretirement account investment such as a 
stock, bond, or mutual fund for more than one year, you get a tax break if you sell 
that investment at a profit. Specifically, your profit is taxed under the lower capi-
tal gains tax rate schedule. If you’re in the 25 to 35 percent federal income tax 
bracket, you pay just 15 percent of your long-term capital gains’ profit in federal 
taxes. (The same lower tax rate applies to qualified stock dividends.) The long-
term capital gains tax jumps up to 20 percent for those income tax filers in the 
highest income tax bracket of 39.6 percent. High-income earners actually face an 
additional 3.8 percent surtax due to the Affordable Care Act (also known as 
­Obamacare), bringing the highest effective long-term capital gains tax rate to 
23.8 percent. If you’re in the 10 or 15 percent federal income tax brackets, the 
long-term capital gains tax rate is 0 percent. (Note: As this book goes to press in 
late 2017, the tax laws may change, but those changes aren’t yet clear. Visit my 
website, www.erictyson.com, for any updates.)
Enlisting Education Tax Breaks
The U.S. tax laws include numerous tax breaks for education-related expendi-
tures. Here are the important tax-reduction opportunities you should know about 
for yourself and your kids if you have them:
»
» Tax deductions for college expenses: You may take up to a $2,500 tax 
deduction on IRS Form 1040 for college costs as long as your modified 
adjusted gross income (AGI) is less than $65,000 for single taxpayers and less 
than $135,000 for married couples filing jointly. (Note: You may take a partial 
tax deduction if your AGI is between $65,000 and $80,000 for single taxpayers 
and between $135,000 and $165,000 for married couples filing jointly.)
»
» Tax-free investment earnings in special accounts: Money invested in 
Coverdell Education Savings Accounts (ESAs) and in Section 529 plans is 
sheltered from taxation and is not taxed upon withdrawal as long as the 
money is used to pay for eligible education expenses. Subject to eligibility 
requirements, you may contribute up to $2,000 annually to Coverdell ESAs. 
529 plans allow you to sock away more than $200,000. However, funding such 
accounts may harm your kid’s qualifications for financial aid.

CHAPTER 6  Taxes: Reduce Them or Else!      91
»
» Tax credits: The American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning credits provide 
tax relief to low- and moderate-income earners facing education costs. The 
full credit (up to $2,500 per student) is available to individuals whose modified 
adjusted gross income is $65,000 or less, or $130,000 or less for married 
couples filing jointly. The credit is phased out for taxpayers above that. The 
credit can be claimed for expenses for the first four years of postsecondary 
education. You may be able to claim an American Opportunity tax credit in the 
same year in which you receive a distribution from either an ESA or 529, but 
you can’t use expenses paid with a distribution from either an ESA or 529 as 
the basis for the American Opportunity credit.
Preparing Your Tax Return and  
Minimizing Your Taxes
Every year that you earn money, you’ll probably complete a federal and state 
income tax return. Regardless of which approach you use to prepare and file your 
returns, you should take financial moves during the year to reduce your taxes.
Here are some resources to help:
»
» IRS materials and guidance: If you have a relatively simple, straightforward 
situation, filing your tax return on your own by using IRS instructions and 
pamphlets is okay. However, recognize that their publications don’t go out of 
their way to highlight tax-reduction opportunities. And if you call the IRS with 
questions, know that the IRS has been known to give wrong information from 
time to time. For you web surfers, the Internal Revenue Service website (www.
irs.gov) is among the better Internet tax sites, believe it or not.
»
» Preparation and advice guides: Books about tax preparation and tax 
planning that highlight common problem areas and are written in clear, 
simple English are invaluable. They supplement the official instructions, not 
only by helping you complete your return correctly but also by showing you 
how to save as much money as possible. Please visit my website (www.
erictyson.com) for up-to-date recommendations.
»
» Software: Good tax-preparation software can be helpful. TurboTax is a good 
program that I’ve reviewed. If you go the software route, I highly recommend 
having a good tax advice book by your side.

92      PART 2  Saving and Earning More
»
» Professional hired help: Competent tax preparers and advisors can save you 
money by identifying tax-reduction strategies you may overlook. They can also 
help reduce the likelihood of an audit, which can be triggered by blunders. Tax 
practitioners come with varying backgrounds, training, and credentials. The 
more training and specialization a tax practitioner has (and the more affluent 
his clients), the higher his hourly fee usually is. Fees and competence vary 
greatly.
Enrolled agents (EAs) must pass IRS scrutiny in order to be called an enrolled 
agent. This license allows the agent to represent you before the IRS in the 
event of an audit. Continuing education is also required; the training is 
generally longer and more sophisticated than it is for a typical preparer. 
Returns that require some of the more common schedules (such as Schedule 
A for deductions) cost about $250+ to prepare. To obtain names and tele-
phone numbers of EAs in your area, contact the National Association of 
Enrolled Agents (NAEA) at 202-822-6232 or www.naea.org.
If you’re self-employed and/or you file lots of other schedules, you may want 
to consider hiring a certified public accountant (CPA). But you don’t need to do 
so year after year. If your situation grows complex one year and then stabi-
lizes, consider getting help for the perplexing year and then using preparation 
guides, software, or a lower-cost preparer or enrolled agent in the future. CPAs 
go through significant training and examination before receiving the CPA 
credential. In order to maintain this designation, a CPA must also complete a 
fair number of continuing education classes every year. CPA fees vary tremen-
dously. Most charge $100+ per hour, but CPAs at large companies and in 
high-cost-of-living areas tend to charge somewhat more.

Housing: Comparing 
Renting and Buying
O
ver the decades of your adult life, you need a place to live. Housing is 
important because you spend a lot of time in it, and its location affects 
your commute to work, your social life, and the convenience of recreation, 
shopping alternatives, and other activities. And you spend plenty of money on 
housing, whether you rent or own it. Along with taxes, housing expenses are one 
of the top two expenses for most people.
This chapter explores your housing options and helps you understand the costs of 
buying and owning a home and compare that option to renting. If you decide to 
purchase a home, I walk you through the major elements of searching for and 
negotiating your best deal on a home for purchase.
The Ins and Outs of Renting
Most books on home buying and real estate fail to offer a balanced perspective of 
renting versus buying. Too many of them only extol the virtues of buying and 
owning property without discussing the drawbacks. In this section, I discuss the 

94      PART 2  Saving and Earning More
benefits and long-term costs of renting. I also cover the important details of 
rental applications and contracts.
Seeing the benefits of renting
Although owning a home and investing in real estate generally pay off well over 
the long term, renting has its advantages. Some of the financially successful rent-
ers I’ve met include people who pay relatively low rent, either because they live in 
small housing and/or have roommates, or they live in a rent-controlled building. 
Some young adults live with a family member who provides them with a great deal 
on rent, which can have benefits. If you can consistently save 10 percent or more 
of your earnings, which you may be able to do through a low-cost rental, you’re 
probably on track to achieving your financial goals.
Renting has the following pros:
»
» You can avoid worrying about or being responsible for fixing up the 
property. Your landlord is responsible.
»
» You have more financial and psychological flexibility. You may not be sure 
that you’ll stay with your current employer or chosen career, and you may 
change direction in the future and not want the financial overhead that comes 
with a mortgage. And if you want to move, you can generally do so a lot more 
easily as a renter than you can as a homeowner.
»
» You can have all your money in financial assets that you can tap into 
more easily. Some people enter their retirement years with a substantial 
portion of their wealth tied up in their home, a challenge that you don’t face 
when renting over the long haul. Homeowners who have equity (the differ-
ence between the market value of the property and the debt owed on it) tied 
up in a home at retirement can downsize to a less-costly property to free up 
cash and/or take out a reverse mortgage on their home equity.
Considering the long-term costs of renting
When you crunch the numbers to find out what owning rather than renting a 
comparable place may cost you on a monthly basis, you may discover that owning 
isn’t as expensive as you thought. Or you may find that owning costs more than 
renting. This discovery may tempt you to think that, financially speaking, renting 
is cheaper than owning.

CHAPTER 7  Housing: Comparing Renting and Buying      95
Be careful not to jump to conclusions. Remember that you’re looking at the cost of 
owning versus renting today. What about 10, 20, or 30 years from now? As an owner, 
your biggest monthly expense  — the mortgage payment  — doesn’t increase, 
assuming that you have a fixed-rate mortgage (for an explanation of fixed-rate and 
other types of mortgages, see the “Understanding your mortgage options” section 
later in the chapter). Your property taxes, homeowners insurance, and maintenance 
expenses, which are generally far less than your mortgage payment, should only 
increase with the cost of living. And remember that as a homeowner you build 
equity in your property; that equity can be significant by your retirement.
When you rent, however, your entire monthly rent is subject to inflation. (Living 
in a rent-controlled unit, where the annual increase allowed in your rent is capped, 
is the exception to this rule.)
Completing your rental application
When you’re in the market for a rental, you’ll probably complete an application. 
You’ll be asked to provide such information as your name, current address, date 
of birth, occupation, employer, banking information, credit history, current land-
lord and rental terms, and a couple of references.
Here are some tips to keep in mind as you’re completing your rental application:
»
» Put your best foot forward. Just as a good résumé helps you interest an 
employer and land a job, your rental application helps you secure a place to 
live. So it’s important to fill it out neatly and completely. Does that mean you 
need to list everything on it, including less-than-flattering information? As with 
your résumé, tell the truth but remember the advertising value of 
the document.
With regards to other sources of income, you’re under no obligation to detail 
alimony, child support, or your spouse’s annual income unless you want that 
information considered in your application.
»
» Recognize that you’re authorizing the release of personal and confiden-
tial information. Rental applications generally have a section requiring your 
signature, stating, “I authorize an investigation of my credit, tenant history, 
banking, and employment for the purposes of renting a house, apartment, or 
condominium from this owner, manager, brokerage, finder, agent, or leasing 
company.”
»
» Consider the length of the lease commitment. Most landlords prefer 
tenants who are stable renters and who remain for long periods of time 
(years, not months). Especially if you may want to move to buy a place or 
relocate for a future job, having a one-year lease that goes month to month 
after the first year is a good compromise. If you don’t expect to stay much 

96      PART 2  Saving and Earning More
more than a year or two, that’s probably better left unsaid. Remember, 
landlords generally want long-term tenants.
»
» Rent where you might like to buy. If you’re getting close to wanting to buy 
your own home, try renting in the area in which you think you’d most like to 
buy. What better way to test out whether you’ll actually enjoy living in an area?
Figuring the Costs of Owning and 
Making It Happen Financially
Buying a home can be financially rewarding, but owning a property is a big finan-
cial commitment that may backfire if you get in over your head or overpay.
In this section, I help you with comparing the costs of buying versus renting, 
determining what you can afford, figuring out how much to borrow, and accumu-
lating the down payment.
Deciding to buy
Before you determine whether you want to actually buy a home, you want to figure 
out how long you plan on living in the home.
Financially speaking, buying a home begins to make more financial sense if you 
anticipate being there for three to five years or more. Buying and selling a prop-
erty entails a lot of expenses, including the cost of getting a mortgage (points; 
application and appraisal fees), inspection expenses, moving costs, real-estate 
agents’ commissions, and title insurance. To cover these transaction costs plus 
the additional costs of ownership, a property needs to appreciate about 15 percent 
during the tenure of your ownership.
If you need or want to move in a couple of years, counting on 15 percent apprecia-
tion is risky. If you’re fortunate and you happen to buy before a sharp upturn in 
housing prices, you may get it. Otherwise, you’ll lose money on the deal.
Comparing the costs of owning  
versus renting
Some people assume that owning costs more than renting, but owning doesn’t 
have to cost a lot. Owning may even cost less than renting in some geographic 
areas, especially with the opportunity to buy at lower prices that occur after a 

CHAPTER 7  Housing: Comparing Renting and Buying      97
decline in home values that sometimes occurs (usually around the time of a 
recession).
Buying seems a lot more expensive than renting if you compare your monthly rent 
(from hundreds of dollars to more than $1,000, depending on where you live) to a 
property’s purchase price, which is usually a much larger number  — perhaps 
$100,000 to $250,000. But you must compare the expenses the same way. When 
you consider a home purchase, you’re forced to think about your housing expenses 
in one huge chunk rather than in a monthly rent check.
To make a fair comparison between ownership and rental costs, figure what it 
costs on a monthly basis to buy a place you desire versus what it costs in monthly 
rent for a comparable place. Remember that mortgage interest and property tax 
payments for your home are generally tax-deductible. The worksheet in Table 7-1 
enables you to do a monthly rent versus buy cost comparison.
Now compare Line 9 in Table 7-1 with the monthly rent on a comparable place to 
see which costs more — owning or renting.
Mortgage
To determine the monthly payment on your proposed mortgage, multiply the rel-
evant number (“multiplier”) from Table  7-2 by the size of your mortgage 
expressed in thousands of dollars (divided by 1,000). For example, if you’re taking 
out a $100,000, 30-year mortgage at 5 percent, you multiply 100 by 5.37 for a 
$537 monthly payment.

98      PART 2  Saving and Earning More
Property taxes
You can ask a real-estate person, mortgage lender, or your local assessor’s office 
what your annual property tax bill would be for a house of similar value to the one 
you’re considering buying (the average is about 1.5 percent of your property’s 
value). Divide this amount by 12 to arrive at your monthly property tax bill.
Tax savings in home ownership
Generally speaking, mortgage interest and property tax payments for your home 
are tax-deductible on Schedule A of IRS Form 1040. Here’s a shortcut that works 
quite well in determining your tax savings in home ownership: Multiply your fed-
eral tax rate (see Table 6-1 in Chapter 6) by the total amount of your property 
taxes and mortgage payment. (Technically speaking, not all of your mortgage 
payment is tax-deductible — only the portion of the mortgage payment that goes 
toward interest. In the early years of your mortgage, nearly all of your payment 
goes toward interest. On the other hand, you may earn state tax benefits from 
your deductible mortgage interest and property taxes.)

CHAPTER 7  Housing: Comparing Renting and Buying      99
If you want to more accurately determine how home ownership may affect your 
tax situation, get out your tax return and try plugging in some reasonable num-
bers to estimate how your taxes will change. You can also speak with a tax 
advisor.
Considering your overall financial health
Before you buy a property and agree to a particular mortgage, take stock of your 
overall financial health (especially where you stand in terms of retirement plan-
ning). Don’t trust a lender when he tells you what you can “afford” according to 
some formulas the bank uses to figure out what kind of a credit risk you are.
To determine how much a potential home buyer can borrow, lenders look primar-
ily at annual income; they pay no attention to some major aspects of a borrower’s 
overall financial situation. Even if you don’t have money tucked away in retire-
ment savings, or you have several children to clothe, feed, and help put through 
college, or you want to financially help your elderly parents, you still qualify for 
the same size loan as other people with the same income (assuming equal out-
standing debts).
Calculating how much you can borrow
One general rule says you can borrow up to about three times your annual income 
when buying a home. But, the maximum that a mortgage lender will loan you 
depends on interest rates. If rates fall, the monthly payment on a mortgage also 
drops. Thus, lower interest rates make real estate more affordable.
To determine how much they’re willing to lend you, lenders start by totaling 
up your monthly housing expenses for a given home. They define your housing 
costs as
mortgage payment 
 property taxes 
 homeowners insurance
Lenders typically loan you up to about 40 percent of your monthly gross (before 
taxes) income for the housing expense. (If you’re self-employed, take your net 
income from the bottom line of your federal tax form Schedule C and divide by 12 
to get your monthly gross income.)
Lenders also consider your other debts when deciding how much to lend you. 
These debts diminish the funds available to pay your housing expenses. Lenders 
add the amount you need to pay down your other consumer debts (such as auto 
loans and credit cards) to your monthly housing expense. The total monthly costs 
of these debt payments plus your housing costs typically can’t exceed 45 percent.

100      PART 2  Saving and Earning More
Accumulating your down payment
You generally qualify for the most favorable mortgage terms by making a down 
payment of at least 20 percent of the property’s purchase price. In addition to sav-
ing money on interest, you can avoid the added cost of private mortgage insurance 
(PMI) by putting down this much. To protect against their losing money in the 
event you default on your loan, lenders usually require PMI, which costs several 
hundred dollars per year on a typical mortgage. (PMI compensates the lender in 
the event that it has to take over the property and the property ends up being 
worth less than the outstanding mortgage on it.)
Many folks, especially folks in their 20s, don’t have enough cash on hand to 
make  a 20 percent down payment on a home to avoid paying PMI. Here are a 
number of solutions for coming up with that 20 percent faster or for buying with 
less money down:
»
» Minimize your spending. See Chapter 5 for ideas.
»
» Consider lower-priced properties. Smaller properties and ones that need 
some work can help keep down the purchase price and, therefore, the 
required down payment.
»
» Find financial partners. Draft a legal contract to specify what happens if a 
partner wants out, divorces, or passes away.
»
» Seek reduced down-payment financing. Some property owners or develop-
ers may be willing to finance your purchase with 10 percent down, although 
you can’t be as picky about properties because not as many are available under 
these terms — many need work or haven’t been sold yet for other reasons.
»
» Get family assistance. If your parents, grandparents, or other relatives have 
money dozing away in a savings or CD account, they may be willing to lend (or 
even give) you the down payment.

Finding the Right Property
In your search for a property to purchase, you have many options in today’s real-
estate market. To find the right property for you, consider your choices:
»
» Single-family home: Some people’s image of a home is a single-family house, 
perhaps with a lawn and a white picket fence. From an investment 

CHAPTER 7  Housing: Comparing Renting and Buying      101
perspective, single-family homes generally do best in the long run. Most 
people, when they can afford it, prefer a stand-alone home.
»
» Higher-density housing: In some areas, particularly in higher-cost neighbor-
hoods, you find the following choices:
•	 Condominiums: You own the unit and a share of everything else.
•	 Town homes: These properties are attached or row houses.
•	 Cooperatives: You own a share of the entire building.
The appeal of such higher-density housing is that it’s generally less expensive 
on a per-square-foot-of-living-space basis. In some cases, you don’t have to 
worry about some of the general maintenance because the homeowners 
association (which you pay for, directly or indirectly) takes care of it.
If you don’t have the time, energy, or desire to keep up a property, shared/higher- 
density housing may make sense for you. You generally get more living space for 
your dollar, and it may also provide you with more security than a stand-alone 
home. However, shared housing is easier to build and hence easier to overbuild.
With that being said, you should remember that a rising tide generally raises all 
boats. In a good real-estate market, all types of housing appreciate, although 
single-family homes tend to do best. Shared-housing values tend to increase the 
most in densely populated urban areas with little available land for new building.
From an investment-return perspective, if you can afford a smaller single-family 
home rather than a larger shared-housing unit, buy the single-family home. Be 
especially wary of buying shared housing in suburban areas with lots of develop-
able land.
Points to research
Here are some additional tips to keep in mind to help you find the best property 
for your situation and to buy a home most likely to increase in value:
»
» Cast a broad net and look at different types of properties in a number of 
communities before you narrow your search. Be open-minded, and figure 
out which of your many criteria for a home you really care about.
»
» Even (and especially) if you fall in love with a house, go back to the 
neighborhood at various times of the day and on different days of the 
week. Travel to and from your prospective new home during commute hours to 
see how long your commute will really take. Knock on a few doors and meet 
your potential neighbors. You may discover, for example, that a flock of chickens 
lives in the backyard next door or that the street and basement frequently flood.

GATHERING DATA ON PROSPECTIVE 
NEIGHBORHOODS
I’ve long been a fan of Neighborhood Scout as a tool for helping prospective home 
buyers use data and information to find communities that meet their specific wants and 
needs. Their website (www.NeighborhoodScout.com) is useful if you are considering a 
number of places you might live in a given area and are seeking more and unbiased 
information. The site is especially useful to folks with multiple job possibilities and those 
who have great flexibility in where they can live (for example, because they are self-
employed or can telecommute for their job).
For a fee (detailed later in this sidebar), Neighborhood Scout provides you with access 
to a treasure trove of just about every type of helpful data you can imagine that may be 
useful in finding your ideal place to live.
You can find much of this data in other places, but you have to go to different agencies 
and websites. I haven’t found a site as comprehensive as Neighborhood Scout.
Neighborhood Scout uses hundreds of characteristics to build profiles of census tracts, 
which typically comprise areas where a few thousand people live and are generally 
much smaller than the areas zip codes comprise. Among the highly useful data avail-
able for searching for your best neighborhood are things like school quality; housing 
costs; crime rates; income levels; the age, size, and style of homes; the density of build-
ings; rental areas versus owner occupied; the proportion of families with children; the 
ages of people in the neighborhood; ethnic and racial makeup; educational levels; lan-
guages spoken; types of careers of those living in the neighborhood; the numbers of 
farms, coastal properties, and the like; and much more. A feature called “Scout Vision 
Trends & Forecasts” includes historic home price-appreciation data by neighborhood 
and estimates for expected appreciation over the next three years.
You can also search for specific types of predetermined “Lifestyle Neighborhoods” that 
seek to match you to commonly sought lifestyles or life stages. Among the categories 
that the site includes are families with children; first-time homebuyers; young, single, 
and upwardly mobile; and college students.
Using the “Build” feature, you can enter your own criteria for what you’re looking for 
from your desired neighborhood, and Neighborhood Scout will tell you what neighbor-
hoods in a particular area, state, or even nationally are your best fit.
Using the “Match” feature, you can enter an address of a place you like and find other 
similar neighborhoods that are the closest match.
Neighborhood Scout’s pricing structure takes some time to understand. With a “Starter” 
account, you can get one free complete report for a specific neighborhood by entering

»
» Examine the area schools. Go visit them. Don’t rely on statistics about test 
scores. Talk to parents and teachers. What’s really going on at the school? 
Even if you don’t have kids, the quality of the local school has a direct bearing 
on the property’s value.
»
» Determine whether crime is a problem. Call the local police department 
and check out real-estate websites with such data.
»
» Talk to the planning department. What are your property taxes going to 
be? Will future development be allowed? If so, what type?
»
» Identify any other potential risks. Is the property located in an area 
susceptible to major risks, such as floods, mudslides, fires, or earthquakes?
Consider these issues even if they’re not important to you, because they can affect 
the property’s resale value. Make sure you know what you’re getting yourself into 
before you buy.
Working with Real-Estate Agents
A top-notch real-estate agent can be a significant help when you purchase or sell a 
property. But because agents work on commission and get paid a percentage of the 
sale price, they face numerous conflicts of interest. So don’t expect an agent to give 
you objective advice about what you should do given your overall financial situa-
tion. Examine your financial situation before you decide to work with an agent.
your email address. You can buy additional complete reports on other neighborhoods 
for $9.99 each.
If you anticipate wanting to view many complete neighborhood reports, you may con-
sider a “Pro” level subscription, which costs $159 monthly and provides up to 100 
reports per month (unused report credits carry forward to future months). You can turn 
this into an annually prepaid subscription and reduce that monthly cost by 20 percent.
One other subscription option, a “Basic” level subscription, provides a much more 
stripped-down report on specific neighborhoods of interest to you. These reports 
include less than half of all the data contained in a complete report; you can see the 
specifics of what’s included on the Neighborhood Scout web page that shows a compar-
ison of the subscription plans and features. The cost for the “Basic” subscription is 
$79.99 to get up to 50 reports per month (and a 20 percent discount if you pay for a 
year in advance).

104      PART 2  Saving and Earning More
Interview several agents and check references. Ask agents for the names and 
phone numbers of at least three clients they worked with in the past six months 
(in the geographical area in which you’re looking). For more advice on hiring a 
good agent, see Chapter 18.
Financing Your Home
A mortgage loan from a bank or other source makes up the difference between the 
cash you intend to put into the purchase and the agreed-upon selling price of the 
real estate. This section reviews the different options you have for financing your 
home, explains which ones are best, and discusses how to get your loan approved.
Understanding your mortgage options
Three major types of mortgages exist — those with a fixed interest rate, those 
with a variable or adjustable rate, and those that are a combination of the two.
»
» Fixed-rate mortgages: These are usually issued for a 15- or 30-year period 
and have interest rates that don’t change. Because the interest rate stays the 
same, your monthly mortgage payment amount doesn’t change. With a 
fixed-rate mortgage, you have no uncertainty or interest-rate worries.
»
» Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARM): In contrast to a fixed-rate mortgage, an 
adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) carries an interest rate that varies over time. 
Thus, the size of your monthly payment fluctuates. Because a mortgage 
payment makes an unusually large dent in most homeowners’ checkbooks 
anyway, signing up for an ARM without understanding its risks is dangerous.
So why would anyone want an ARM? Some home buyers are attracted to the 
potential interest-rate savings, especially during the first few years of an 
adjustable loan, when the interest rate is typically lower than it is on a 
comparable fixed-rate loan.
»
» Hybrid mortgages: This type of mortgage combines features of both the 
fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgages. For example, the initial rate may hold 
constant for three to five years and then adjust once a year or every six 
months thereafter.

CHAPTER 7  Housing: Comparing Renting and Buying      105
Deciding which mortgage type 
is best for you
You should weigh the pros and cons of each mortgage type and consider these 
issues to determine whether a fixed or adjustable mortgage is best for you. Think 
about the following questions to make that determination:
»
» How much risk can you handle with the size of your monthly mortgage 
payment? You can’t afford much risk, for example, if your job and income are 
unstable and you need to borrow a lot or you have little slack in your monthly 
budget. If you’re in this situation, stick with a fixed-rate loan. If interest rates 
rise, how will you afford the monthly payments — much less all the other 
expenses of home ownership? And don’t forget to factor in reasonably 
predictable future expenses that may affect your ability to make payments. 
For example, are you planning to start a family soon? If so, your income may 
fall while your expenses rise (as they surely will).
If you can’t afford the highest allowed payment on an adjustable-rate 
mortgage, don’t take it. You shouldn’t accept the chance that the interest rate 
may not rise that high — it might, and then you could lose your home! Ask 
your lender to calculate the highest possible maximum monthly payment on 
your loan. That’s the payment you’d face if the interest rate on your loan were 
to go to the highest level allowed (the lifetime cap).
»
» How long do you plan to keep the mortgage? The savings on most 
adjustables is usually guaranteed in the first two or three years, because an 
adjustable-rate mortgage starts at a lower interest rate than a fixed one. If 
rates rise, you can end up giving back or losing the savings you achieve in the 
early years of the mortgage. In most cases, if you aren’t going to keep your 
mortgage more than five to seven years, you’re probably paying unnecessary 
interest costs to carry a fixed-rate mortgage.
You may want to look into a hybrid loan. These loans may make sense for you 
if you foresee a high probability of keeping your loan seven to ten years or 
less but want some stability in your monthly payments. The longer the initial 
rate stays locked in, the higher the rate.
Get a written itemization of charges from all lenders you’re seriously considering 
so you can more readily compare different lenders’ mortgages and so you have no 
surprises when you close on your loan. And to minimize your chances of throwing 
money away on a loan for which you may not qualify, ask the lender whether you 
may not be approved for some reason. Be sure to disclose any problems you’re 
aware of that are on your credit report or with the property.

106      PART 2  Saving and Earning More
Some lenders offer loans without points (upfront interest) or other lender charges. 
Remember: If lenders don’t charge points or other fees, they have to make up the 
difference by charging a higher interest rate on your loan. Consider such loans 
only if you lack cash for closing or if you’re planning to use the loan for just a 
few years.
Avoiding negative amortization 
and interest-only loans
As you make mortgage payments over time, the loan balance you still owe is 
gradually reduced, a process known as amortizing the loan. The reverse of this 
process  — increasing your loan balance  — is called negative amortization. You 
want to steer clear of negative-amortization mortgages.
Some ARMs allow negative amortization. Your outstanding loan balance can grow 
even though you’re continuing to make mortgage payments when your mortgage 
payment is less than it really should be.
Taking on negative amortization is like paying only the minimum payment 
required on a credit-card bill. You keep racking up greater interest charges on the 
balance as long as you make only the artificially low payment. Doing so defeats 
the whole purpose of borrowing an amount that fits your overall financial goals. 
And you may never get your mortgage paid off! Even worse, the increased interest 
you start to accrue on the unpaid interest added to your mortgage balance may not 
be tax-deductible because it doesn’t qualify as interest incurred as part of the 
original purchase (what the IRS calls the acquisition debt).
The only way to know for certain whether a loan includes negative amortization is 
to ask. Some lenders aren’t forthcoming about telling you. You find negative 
amortization more frequently on loans that lenders consider risky. If you’re hav-
ing trouble finding lenders who are willing to deal with your financial situation, 
be especially careful.
Some loans cap the increase of your monthly payment but not of the interest rate. 
The size of your mortgage payment may not reflect all the interest you owe on 
your loan. So rather than paying off the interest and some of your loan balance (or 
principal) every month, you’re paying off some, but not all, of the interest you owe. 
Thus, the extra unpaid interest you still owe is added to your outstanding debt.
Also tread carefully with interest-only mortgages, which are loans in which you pay 
only interest in the beginning years. Don’t consider interest-only loans if you’re 
stretching to be able to afford a home, and consider one only if you understand 
how they work and can afford the inevitable jump in payments.

CHAPTER 7  Housing: Comparing Renting and Buying      107
Getting your mortgage approved
When you’re under contract to buy a property, having your loan denied after wait-
ing several weeks can mean you lose the property as well as the money you spent 
applying for the loan and having the property inspected. Some property sellers 
may be willing to give you an extension, but others won’t. So you want to make 
sure you get your mortgage approved.
Here’s how to increase your chances of having your mortgage approved:
»
» Get your finances in shape before you shop. You won’t know what you can 
afford to spend on a home until you whip your personal finances into shape. 
Do so before you begin to make offers on properties. This book can help you. 
If you have consumer debt, pay it down.
»
» Clean up credit-report problems. If you think you may have errors on your 
credit report, get a copy before you apply for a mortgage. Chapter 4 details 
how to obtain a free copy of your credit report and correct mistakes.
»
» Get prequalified or preapproved. When you get prequalified, a lender 
speaks with you about your financial situation and then calculates the 
maximum amount it’s willing to lend you. Preapproval is much more in-depth 
and includes a lender’s review of your financial statements. Just be sure not to 
waste your time and money getting preapproved if you’re not really ready to 
get serious about buying.
»
» Be upfront about problems. You may be able to stop potential loan rejection 
by disclosing to your lender anything that may cause a problem before you 
apply.
»
» Work around low/unstable income. When you’ve been changing jobs or 
you’re self-employed, your income may be down or unstable. Making a larger 
down payment is one way around this problem. You may try getting a 
cosigner, such as a relative. Be sure to have a written agreement, including 
who’s responsible for payments.
»
» Consider a backup loan. You certainly should shop among different lenders, 
and you may want to apply to more than one for a mortgage. Disclose to each 
lender what you’re doing; the second lender that pulls your credit report will 
see that another lender has already done so.

108      PART 2  Saving and Earning More
Putting Your Deal Together
After you do your homework on your personal finances, decide which kind of 
mortgage to choose, and research neighborhoods and home prices, you’ll hope-
fully be ready to close in on your goal. Eventually, you’ll find a home you want to 
buy. Before you make that first offer, though, you need to understand the impor-
tance of negotiations, inspections, and the other elements of a real-estate deal:
»
» Never fall in love with a property. If you have money to burn and can’t 
imagine life without the home you just discovered, pay what you will. 
Otherwise, remind yourself that other good properties are out there. Having a 
backup property in mind can help.
»
» Find out about the property and owner before you make your offer. 
How long has the property been on the market? What are its flaws? Why is 
the owner selling? The more you understand about the property and the 
seller’s motivations, the better able you’ll be to draft an offer that meets both 
parties’ needs.
»
» Get comparable sales data to support your price. Pointing to recent and 
comparable home sales to justify your offer price strengthens your case.
»
» Remember that price is only one of several negotiable items. You may be 
able to get a seller to pay for certain repairs or improvements, to pay some of 
your closing costs, or to offer you favorable loan terms. Likewise, the real-
estate agent’s commission is negotiable.
»
» Spend the time and money to locate and hire good inspectors and other 
experts to evaluate the major systems and potential problem areas of 
the home. When problems that you weren’t aware of are uncovered, the 
inspection reports give you the information you need to go back and ask the 
property seller to fix the problems or reduce the property’s purchase price to 
compensate you for correcting the deficiencies yourself.
»
» Shop around for title insurance and escrow services. Mortgage lenders 
require title insurance to protect against someone else claiming legal title to 
your property. Escrow charges pay for neutral third-party services to ensure 
that the instructions of the purchase contract or refinance are fulfilled and 
that everyone gets paid. Many people don’t seem to understand that title 
insurance and escrow fees vary from company to company. When you call 
around for title insurance and escrow fee quotes, make sure you understand 
all the fees. Many companies tack on all sorts of charges for things such as 
courier fees and express mail. If you find a company with lower prices and 
want to use it, ask for an itemization in writing so you don’t have any 
surprises.

Relationships and Money
Y
ou may plan on getting married someday. Before that day, you’ll likely live 
together with other people. Perhaps you’ll simply have roommates, or you 
may live with a significant other.
When you live with others, you may share household expenses and other matters. 
In this chapter, I discuss how best to handle the financial side of these situations.
Handling Roommates
As I discuss in Chapter 5, sharing the rent with roommates is a time-tested way 
of containing your housing costs when you’re young, single, and need housing. 
However, having roommates doesn’t mean you’re free of problems. In fact, how 
you handle living with roommates can potentially have significant effects on your 
own personal finances.

110      PART 2  Saving and Earning More
If you’re going to share a rental with roommates, a wise decision is to draft a 
roommate agreement and have all your rental mates sign it. A roommate agreement 
basically is a legal agreement of important issues between you and your 
roommate(s). (You can find these templates online on various websites.) The 
following are some characteristics of a standard roommate agreement:
»
» The agreement’s financial terms are legally enforceable with your roommates, 
but they aren’t legally binding with your landlord.
»
» To keep legal fees down, the agreement should include a mediation clause.
»
» The agreement should reflect your concerns and priorities. For example, if 
you need your eight hours of sleep every night, and you therefore require 
peace and quiet starting at 10 p.m., then the agreement should spell out 
those sorts of details. Examples of items you may want to cover in the 
agreement include
•	 Who pays how much rent, when, and to whom
•	 How bedrooms are allocated and whether rent depends on which one 
you have
•	 Who’s responsible for which chores
•	 How parking is handled if it’s limited
•	 Whether pets and overnight guests are allowed
•	 How much notice should be given when someone needs to move out
•	 Whose responsibility it is to find a replacement roommate
If one of your roommates does something in violation of the rental agreement, 
you all are responsible. Suppose, for example, that one of your roommates fails to 
pay the rent on time, damages the rental unit in some way, or has loud parties that 
warrant calls to the police by neighbors. You and your roommates are all respon-
sible for the missing rent, the damages, or the intrusion on your neighbors. The 
landlord can also add insult to injury and terminate your rental contract. (One 
exception to this is if you as a renter have subleased to a tenant and that’s the 
person who has violated the rules of the rental agreement. Another related excep-
tion is if your rental is subject to local rental control laws and you’re designated 
as a master tenant with authority to approve and evict tenants.)
Some landlords make an effort to identify the bad apple in an otherwise good 
group of tenants and may not hold the good apples responsible. But, don’t count 
on this happening. Choose your roommates wisely and nip problems in the bud 

CHAPTER 8  Relationships and Money      111
before they mushroom into bigger issues. Sit down with everyone and have a 
­candid discussion about problems, and work toward a solution. Communicate 
respectfully and in a timely fashion with your landlord.
Living-Together Contracts
What if you’re involved in a relationship with someone and you’re living with that 
person? That situation may be more complicated than having a roommate and 
dealing with a contract for a roommate because your finances and personal pos-
sessions may be more intertwined. You may want to consider a living-together 
contract, which is used by folks who aren’t married to each other.
Practically speaking, your agreement can help you avoid trouble when you mix 
your money and property, and it can make clear your intentions and expectations 
regarding property ownership, household expenses, and the like. It can also 
greatly ease the division or distribution of property after a breakup or death. On a 
more personal note, the process of negotiating and drafting your agreement may 
well strengthen your abilities to communicate with and understand each other.
Here’s an overview of the legal rules and practical concerns you should think 
about before drafting a contract of your own. Nearly all states recognize and 
enforce contracts between unmarried partners. Topics you may want to address in 
your contract include
»
» Personal property: You may want to delineate and keep separate any 
property that you owned before moving in together, as well as property you 
inherit or receive as a gift. If you want to divide ownership of property 
purchased during the period of living together some other way than 50-50, 
specify that.
»
» Living expenses: Your agreement should specify how your household’s 
expenses are divvied up. You can discuss pooling your money versus keeping 
separate accounts, as well as sharing expenses equally or through some other 
method.
»
» Parting ways: Your agreement should detail how your property, especially 
jointly owned property, will be divided in the event one of you decides to 
move out.

112      PART 2  Saving and Earning More
»
» Death: Your agreement (in addition to your will; check out the later sidebar 
“Preparing wills and other important legal documents” for more information) 
should also detail what happens to each person’s property should one or both 
of you die.
»
» Dispute resolution: Providing for mediation and/or arbitration is a time-
tested way to effectively resolve disputes.

Guide for Unmarried Couples (Nolo Press) by Frederick Hertz, Ralph Warner, and 
Toni Ihara.
Getting Married
To help ensure a happy marriage, couples should discuss all sorts of issues before 
getting hitched. Money matters are certainly near the top of that list. Unfortu-
nately, money issues are also on the list of frequently neglected and avoided topics 
for engaged couples. Not surprisingly, money issues are one of the leading causes 
of marital discord and divorce. Discussing money with a loved one makes most 
people uncomfortable, and in many families, talking about money is a taboo topic.
Merging your financial decisions and resources doesn’t have to be unpleasant and 
a source of stress. Even if you’re largely in agreement about your financial goals 
and strategies, managing as two is far different from managing as one. Here are 
my tips to prepare for marriage:
»
» Talk money before getting married. Many couples never talk about their 
financial and personal goals and expectations before marriage, and failing to 
do so breaks up way too many marriages. Finances are just one of the many 
issues you need to discuss. Ensuring that you know what you’re getting 
yourself into is a good way to minimize your chances for heartache. In 
addition to discussing the topics in the rest of this list, also discuss your 
feelings and goals pertaining to earning, spending, saving, and investing 
money. Ministers, priests, and rabbis sometimes offer premarital counseling 
to help bring issues and differences to the surface.
»
» Discuss merging finances versus maintaining separate accounts. I generally 
prefer that couples merge their finances. Marriage is a partnership, and you’re 
supposed to be on the same team. In some marriages, however, spouses may 
choose to keep some money separate so they don’t feel their spouse’s scrutiny 
with regard to different spending preferences. Spouses who’ve been through 

CHAPTER 8  Relationships and Money      113
divorce may choose to keep the assets they bring into the new marriage 
separate in order to protect their money in the event of another divorce. As  
long as you’re jointly accomplishing what you need to financially, some separa-
tion of money is okay. But for the health of your marriage, don’t hide money 
from each other, and if you’re the higher-income spouse, don’t assume power 
and control over your joint income.
»
» Understand and optimize your employer benefits. If one or both of you 
have access to a package of employee benefits through an employer, 
determine how best to make use of those benefits. Coordinating and using 
the best that each package has to offer is like getting a pay raise. If you both 
have access to health insurance, determine which of you has better benefits. 
Likewise, one of you may have a better retirement savings plan — one that 
matches your contribution and offers superior investment options. Unless 
you can afford to save the maximum through both your plans, saving more in 
the better plan increases your combined assets. (Note: If you’re concerned 
about what will happen if you save more in one of your retirement plans and 
then get a divorce, in most states, the money is considered part of your joint 
assets to be divided equally.)
»
» Discuss life and disability insurance needs. If you and your spouse can make 
do without each other’s income, you may not need any income-protecting 
insurance. However, if, like many married couples, you both depend on each 
other’s incomes, or if one of you depends fully or partly on the other’s income, 
one or both of you may need long-term disability and term life insurance 
policies (see Chapter 15).
»
» Prepare updated wills. When you marry, you should make or update your 
wills. Having a will is potentially more valuable when you’re married, especially 
if you want to leave money to others in addition to your spouse, or if you have 
children for whom you need to name a guardian. Check out the nearby 
sidebar “Preparing wills and other important legal documents” for more 
guidance.
»
» Review beneficiaries on investment and life insurance. With retirement 
accounts and life insurance policies, you name beneficiaries to whom the 
money or value in those accounts will go in the event of your passing. When 
you marry, you should review and reconsider your beneficiaries.
After you’re married, you and your spouse should set aside time once a year, or 
every few years, to discuss personal and financial goals for the years ahead. When 
you talk about where you want to go, you help ensure that you’re both rowing your 
financial boat in unison.

and your spouse die without a will (a condition called intestate), the state (courts and 
social-service agencies) decides who will raise your children. Therefore, even if you can’t 
decide at this time who you want to raise your children, you should at least appoint a 
trusted guardian who can decide for you.
Even if you have no dependents, having a will is wise because it provides your specific 
instructions on how to handle and distribute your possessions. If you die without a will, 
your state decides how to distribute your money and other property, according to state 
law. Therefore, your friends, distant relatives, and favorite charities would probably 
receive nothing. Without any living relatives, your money may go to the state government!
Without a will, your heirs are legally powerless, and the state may appoint an adminis-
trator to supervise the distribution of your assets at a fee of around 5 percent of your 
estate. A bond typically must also be posted at a cost of several hundred dollars.
A living will and a medical power of attorney are useful additions to a standard will. A 
living will tells your doctor what, if any, life-support measures you prefer. A medical (or 
healthcare) power of attorney grants authority to someone you trust to make decisions 
regarding your medical care options in the event that you’re deemed incapable of 
making them for yourself.
You don’t need an attorney to make a legal will. Most attorneys, in fact, prepare wills 
and living trusts by using software programs! The simplest and least costly way to pre-
pare a will, a living will, and a medical power of attorney is to use a high-quality, user-
friendly software package such as those published by Nolo Press (www.nolo.com). 
What makes a will valid is that three people witness you signing it. Give copies of these 
documents to the guardians and executors you name.

CHAPTER 8  Relationships and Money      115
than you earn, investing your savings in proven vehicles for the long term, and 
securing adequate insurance coverage — are relatively simple in principle, but 
they can be difficult to put into action.
Many people are unable to follow these rules for the same reasons people can’t 
follow a diet: It’s difficult, and it can be emotionally taxing. I’ve seen many people 
allow their individual fears, biases, mistaken beliefs, past experiences, and other 
quirks and demons, along with external pressures from a consumption-oriented 
society, to color and sabotage their efforts to practice good financial habits.
The following sections and exercises can help you improve your personal money 
beliefs and tendencies.
Examining your money history
In order to identify, accept, and overcome the money-related obstacles that are 
currently preventing you from making the most of what you have and reaching a 
place in life where you’re satisfied with your position  — financially and 
personally — start getting a handle on what I call your “money history,” particularly 
the influence of your parents, your childhood, and young-adult environments.
Taking a historical inventory isn’t easy, but if you put in the time and want to 
challenge yourself and your beliefs, the process can be productive.
Set aside time — about an hour should do — for some personal reflection, ideally 
in a place and at a time that frees you from distractions. Consider going to the 
library, the beach, a coffee shop, or some other place that’s away from your home. 
Reflect upon the following questions:
»
» What personal experiences (good and bad) relating to money do you recall 
from your childhood? Did you work as a kid and teenager? What lessons did 
you take away from these experiences? If you didn’t work, think about why 
you didn’t and what your parents said to you (or implied) about working and 
making money.
»
» What memories of your parents (or other guardians) do you have that relate 
to finances? Were your parents spenders or savers? What financial crises 
occurred, and how did your parents handle them? Did money cause tension 
and problems at home? If you don’t have many explicit recollections about 
money with your caregivers, what implicit messages did you take away from 
the way they led their lives and the role that money played in it?
»
» What efforts did your mom and dad make to teach you about money? How 
much freedom and latitude did they give you with money? What lessons did 

116      PART 2  Saving and Earning More
you take away from this? If you had to summarize their philosophy and 
approach to money in a sentence or two, what would it be?
»
» How important were financial considerations in what you chose to study and 
what jobs and career you sought? Did you pursue work based upon what 
interested you or what you believed you could make more money doing? 
Were you pushed into your career by someone else for the supposed financial 
security you could achieve?
»
» Thinking back to your childhood and young-adult years, what significant 
events happened to you and your family that impacted how you felt about 
money? These events may include, for example, a major illness, a parent 
being laid off, volunteer work you did, and so on. You need not have a long 
laundry list of major events — the two or three most important and formative 
occurrences will do.
Exploring your attitudes toward money
Having taken the time to ponder your background and how it colors the way you 
relate to money (see the preceding section), take the next step and spend some 
time reflecting on your current feelings and attitudes toward money. There are no 
right or wrong answers to many of these questions:
»
» What stresses you about money?
»
» Are you frequently juggling bills and trying to figure out whom to pay next?
»
» Do you watch your investments daily, or do you avoid looking at your 
investment statements out of fear? Why?
»
» Are you looking for a hot investment tip that could multiply your money 
quickly?
»
» What financial secrets are you keeping from your spouse (and others)? What 
would cause you feelings of humiliation and embarrassment?
In working with clients, I’ve found that simply taking the time to think about and 
reflect upon one’s history with money provides valuable insights that enable peo-
ple to cultivate better financial habits. Quite often, people who go through this 
process say things like, “I never took the time to consider why I do what I do with 
money or even what I’m doing.”
Don’t beat yourself up if you can’t handle developing thoughtful responses all in 
one sitting. Some people find these questions bring up strong memories and emo-
tions, so you may need two or three sessions to complete this task.

CHAPTER 8  Relationships and Money      117
Understanding your friends and money
Our peers may have a major influence over how we spend money and even deal with 
money overall. When I used to teach a personal-finance course at the University of 
California, I talked about consumer spending and our choice of cars. Over the years, 
some students confided to me that they had been embarrassed by the shabbiness of 
their cars. One person told me that his co-workers would get on him about his car 
“trashing up” the parking lot. Sales professionals who called on clients and took 
clients out in their car were especially self-conscious about their vehicles.
Here are some examples where money comes into play with others. Consider each 
and what lessons you can take away about how your friends and peers affect the 
way you think about, spend, and use your money:
»
» Going out to eat or for entertainment: Do you go out to restaurants, bars, 
or entertainment venues? Do you go on trips or vacations with others? How 
do you choose the place? Do the folks you tend to hang out with discuss and 
care about the cost, or is it not discussed? How are things handled when it 
comes time to pay the bill?
»
» Lending money: Are you comfortable lending money to friends or family? 
Have you ever done so with bad results (for example, not being repaid)? If the 
loan extends over a lengthy time period (years, not months), have you 
collected a reasonable level of interest?
»
» Gift buying/exchanges: In a typical year, how much do you spend on gifts for 
others? Do you feel obligated to buy many people gifts? Do you find yourself 
spending more than you can comfortably afford or giving more than you 
receive?
Using the above topics as a guide, spend some time reflecting on your interactions 
with friends and other acquaintances relating to money. What are you happy 
about? What would you like to change, and why?
Making sense of your environment 
and money
Another profound influence on how you deal with and relate to money is your 
environment. For example, how did you choose where you live? Wanting to live in 
an area that’s safe and convenient is fine, but if you select a location populated by 
the rich and famous, how will you be able to save money, especially with con-
spicuous consumption surrounding and tempting you?
In addition to where you live, consider the other circles in which you travel — 
your work environment, areas where you spend a lot of your free time, and so on.

118      PART 2  Saving and Earning More
Write down your thoughts about your environment and how it may impact and 
reflect your views on money. In what ways is your current environment a positive 
or negative influence on how you manage your money? What would you like to 
change about your current environment and why?
Getting a Grip on Procrastination 
Where Money is Concerned
In my work as a financial counselor, I often saw physical signs and symptoms that 
indicated I was dealing with someone who was a money procrastinator. This isn’t 
a black-and-white issue. Just about everyone I know procrastinates dealing with 
some aspects of their financial lives and their lives in general.
Diagnosing procrastination
Answer the following questions to identify areas of your financial life where you’re 
procrastinating:
»
» Are you financially disorganized and prone to clutter? Because avoiders 
dislike dealing with money and related issues, they don’t spend their free time 
keeping documents organized and easy to find.
»
» Are you late paying your bills and tax payments? Money avoiders often 
incur late fees and interest charges on various household bills. Those who are 
self-employed, and thus responsible for quarterly income tax filings, are at 
additional risk for falling behind with tax payments, the negative financial 
consequences of which can be huge.
»
» Do you have unopened financial account statements? We all get busy with 
life, but I was amazed at how many money avoiders I worked with who would 
have piles of unopened account statements, even during periods when their 
types of investments were doing fine, thus eliminating any reason for avoiding 
opening potentially bad news.
»
» Do you have a sense of unease, and even shame and embarrassment, 
with having cash sitting around in low-interest accounts? Money avoiders 
who are able to save money may have a tendency to allow it to accumulate, 
for example, in bank accounts that pay little if any interest. While they may 
know that they could and should do better with investing the money, they 
can’t overcome the inertia.

CHAPTER 8  Relationships and Money      119
»
» Do you experience feelings of enormous stress and anxiety over money 
issues and decisions? One of the main reasons that avoiders relate to money in 
the way they do is that for whatever historic reason(s), making financial deci-
sions makes them feel uncomfortable and stressed. (In some cases, for exam-
ple, growing up in a home where money was an ongoing source of unhappiness, 
conflicts, and problems can lead to avoidance behavior as an adult.) Other 
people believe that they lack the skills and knowledge necessary to take control 
of their finances. Finally, some folks believe, right or wrong, that their current 
financial picture isn’t so bright, so they simply decide to avoid the bad news, 
even though ignoring the situation will only make things worse in the end.
»
» Do you have a low level of interest regarding money issues and deci-
sions? While some avoiders shun financial decisions and responsibilities due 
to anxiety, others are imitating behavior learned from their parents or are 
rebelling against a parent who was financially or emotionally overbearing.
»
» Do you have an absence of long-term financial planning and thinking? 
Many of the money avoiders I dealt with clearly hadn’t thought much about 
what their personal and financial goals were for the years and decades ahead.
»
» Do you have marriage problems relating to money? Money avoiders 
typically have conflicts over money with their spouses, and their avoidance 
may stem from or be exacerbated by that.
Coming to terms with why you may  
procrastinate with money issues
Understanding some of the common feelings and issues surrounding money-
avoidance behavior can help in coming to acknowledge and productively change 
the habits. Here are some common reasons folks put off dealing with certain issues:
»
» Feelings of incompetence: Some people have negative memories and 
associations from prior attempts, with parents or spouses, at dealing with 
money and making financial decisions. Many money avoiders have similar 
feelings of incompetence with math and mathematical analysis, which are 
certainly key abilities to possess for effective personal financial management. 
Lack of experience making financial decisions certainly plays into feelings of 
incompetence as well.
»
» Disorganization: Money avoiders have a tendency to be generally disorga-
nized people who avoid dealing with other facets of their lives as well. With 
only so many hours in the day, people who are poorly organized struggle just 
to deal with work and family responsibilities. Making financial decisions, 
especially involving longer-term issues (such as retirement planning and 
insurance) is easily postponed or never considered.

120      PART 2  Saving and Earning More
»
» Marital friction: Money is among the leading causes of marital discord. So, 
some spouses cope by avoiding the topic altogether in the hopes of keeping 
more harmony in their marriage. In the short-term, this avoidance strategy 
may reduce some stress and arguments. In the long term, however, it doesn’t 
work, as dissatisfaction gone underground doesn’t go away (or get better).
»
» Fear of future problems: People who were abused growing up or lived with 
a loved one who was a substance abuser often worry about bad things 
occurring. Ditto for folks suffering from depression or generalized anxiety 
disorders. Money troubles are often intertwined with these types of issues 
and lead to plenty of negative associations with money and simply not 
wanting to deal with the topic.
»
» Perfectionism: While this is a less-common reason for people shunning 
money matters, some perfectionists continue putting off making decisions 
and taking action because they can always find flaws in or potential obstacles 
to their intended course of action. Or, they may feel that they can make a 
better decision with just a little more thinking and analysis. Of course, no one 
can predict the future, and everyone is limited in terms of time, money, and 
analysis.
»
» Ability to get away with it: Some people simply don’t want to deal with 
money issues and decisions and are able to get along sufficiently through 
good fortune and being surrounded by those who enable the avoiding 
behavior (perhaps through care giving and taking responsibility). 
Unfortunately, life changes and unforeseen problems can expose gaps in 
poor financial management.
»
» Avoidance of difficult issues: Some people procrastinate doing financial 
planning for retirement and buying life insurance for the same reason they 
haven’t prepared a will — they’d rather not think about aging, dying, and other 
difficult and unpleasant topics.
Overcoming money avoidance
If you are a money avoider, my goal isn’t to turn you into someone who loves 
dealing with money. That’s not going to happen. However, I can show you how to 
ensure that you can accomplish common financial goals and won’t suffer the ill 
affects that money avoiders so often do by neglecting their finances.
Overcoming money avoidance takes time and patience. That statement isn’t 
meant to provide you with a reason to forgo making changes in your financial life. 
Instead, I’m relaying a fact and reminding you that change takes time and some 
steps forward are interrupted by steps back.

CHAPTER 8  Relationships and Money      121
The first and most important part of the process is to recognize the tendency to 
procrastinate when it comes to money management and then understand the rea-
sons behind the procrastination. Many people find it helpful to write down their 
feelings relating to money avoidance or to speak about their feelings and history 
with money with someone who is an empathic listener.
In my work as a financial counselor, I found that many avoiders typically felt 
greatly overwhelmed with a laundry list of financial to dos. That’s why you should 
prioritize and only work on the top one or two items at a time. I’d tell clients that 
even though they might have a total of eight or ten things on their longer task 
lists, they shouldn’t expect to complete those next week or even next month. It 
might take six months to a year to work through the longer list.
The following sections offer simple ways to get control of your money.
GOING FROM ANXIOUS TO IN CONTROL
“I always felt stupid about math and wholly inadequate. I can’t even bring myself to use 
a calculator out of fear I won’t even know how to use that properly,” says Heidi, a 40- 
something-year-old woman. It took Heidi about two years to make some major changes 
in how she handled her personal finances. She began to make progress when I was 
able to persuade her that she didn’t have to be a math whiz to make positive financial 
changes. Heidi didn’t have major spending problems, but she was sloppy and lazy about 
saving money and investing it well.
I had her sign up for her employer’s retirement savings plan so she could begin to save 
about 8 percent of her salary. She had the money withdrawn from her salary and 
directed into a handful of well-diversified mutual funds. “I can’t believe how painless it is 
to do this, and there was virtually no math involved. All I had to do was complete a one-
page enrollment form, which required me to say what percentage of my contribution 
went into each fund that I selected,” said Heidi.
With the meager amounts she had been saving that were languishing in a low-interest 
bank account, Heidi would’ve needed to work until her mid-seventies to achieve the 
standard of living in retirement that she desired. Now, she’s on track to be able to stop 
working by her late fifties. Seeing these quantifiable changes in her retirement age and 
gaining a basic understanding of the steps she needs to take to reach her goals was a 
great motivating source to Heidi and has given her savings a purpose. Equally if not 
more important, she feels in control of her life financially and has rid herself of that 
ever-constant anxiety about not being on top of things.

122      PART 2  Saving and Earning More
Pay your bills automatically
People who are financially disorganized often are late paying bills. Late payments, 
particularly when it comes to paying taxes, are a problem that can lead to sub-
stantial late fees, interest, and penalties. Even if the fees and additional interest 
from individual late payments of your other bills  — $5 here and $30 dollars 
there — don’t seem all that significant on their own, they can add up to a hefty 
total if you make paying bills late a habit.
One of the best things that money avoiders can do with their bills is to set each of 
them up for automatic payment. Whether the payment in question is your phone, 
utility, or monthly mortgage bill, you should be able to establish an automatic 
payment plan that doesn’t require you to initiate payment. With just a little 
upfront work with each creditor or billing company — often not much more effort 
than paying a monthly bill — you can rid yourself of unnecessary fees and interest 
and save a little time each month.
Many companies accept (and actually prefer) payment through an electronic 
transfer from your bank account. Some loan holders (including student-loan 
holders) may even lessen your interest rate slightly in return for what amounts to 
a guarantee of an on-time payment every month. If not, you may be able to have 
some payments charged on your credit card, but be careful with this route if you 
sometimes don’t pay that bill on time! (Another alternative is to use online bill 
paying through your bank.)
Develop a regular investment program
All money avoiders should make their investing automatic. If you work for an 
employer, doing so is usually easy. Often, the most daunting part of the process is 
wading through the pile of retirement plan and investment information and bro-
chures your benefits department may dump on you when you tell them that you 
want to sign up for their payroll deduction savings program.
Not only will your money grow faster inside a tax-deferred account, but your 
employer may also offer free matching money.
The simplest way to navigate through the morass of paperwork is to look first for 
the specific form you must complete to sign up for the payroll investment pro-
gram. Thoroughly read that form first so you know what you need to focus on and 
get smarter about as you review the other materials.
If your earnings come from self-employment income, you’ll need to establish 
your own retirement account. Find out about the different retirement account 
options and choose the one that best meets your needs. SEP-IRAs enable you to 

CHAPTER 8  Relationships and Money      123
sock away large amounts  — a self-employed person may contribute up to 
20  ­percent of his business’s net income up to a maximum of $54,000 for tax 
year 2017.
These plans may be established through major mutual-fund companies (I like 
Vanguard, Fidelity, and T. Rowe Price). You can generally set up these accounts so 
a regular monthly amount is zapped electronically from your local bank account 
into your mutual fund investment account. (Be careful not to over-fund your 
account, which may happen if you overestimate your business income prior to 
completing your tax return.)
Close insurance gaps
Nearly every money avoider I’ve met over the years has problematic gaps in insur-
ance coverage. Solving this problem presents some challenges because under-
standing various policies and the coverage of each is complicated. Add on top of 
that the unfortunate fact that to buy most insurance policies, you must deal with 
a commission-based insurance agent. Talk about a recipe for headaches and con-
flicts of interest! But these are not acceptable excuses for avoiding this issue 
because so much is at stake. (For more about insurance, check out Part 4.)
Hire financial help
Money avoiders are clearly a group of people who could benefit from hiring a 
financial advisor. However, they’re also among the people most likely to make a 
poor choice when hiring. It’s difficult to evaluate — or care enough to evaluate — 
the financial expertise (and potential conflicts of interest) of a financial advisor if 
you’re disinterested in (or suffer anxiety about) and actively avoid money issues.
Your first step, if you’re inclined to hire help, is to clearly define what type of 
assistance you desire. Do you need assistance with analyzing your budget and 
developing a plan to pay down consumer debt? If so, most financial advisors aren’t 
prepared to help you with that  — there’s far more money to be made selling 
investment and insurance products to the affluent.
Advisors are best suited for folks who want to quantify how much they should be 
saving for specific goals and determining where to invest it. However, there’s no 
getting around it: You do have to do a lot of digging to find a competent and 
­ethical advisor who has reasonable fees. With that information in hand, you can 
confidently and strategically evaluate potential service providers who can help 
you overcome your inertia and get you on track managing your money.

W
hat’s your most valuable asset? As a young adult, it’s probably your 
future earning potential. That’s why I devote this chapter to helping 
you make the most of your career and future employment. In addition 
to tips to jump-start your career, I discuss furthering your education and training, 
exploring your entrepreneurial options, and handling job changes and loss.
Getting Your Career Going
As you transition from school to the workforce, you can maximize your chances 
for financial and career success. This section discusses arranging your finances 
and making decisions to further invest in your education and training.
Putting everything in order
If you just graduated from school, or you’re otherwise in the your early years in 
the workforce, your increased income and reduction in educational expenses are 

126      PART 2  Saving and Earning More
probably a welcome relief to you and your family — but they’re no guarantee of 
future financial success. Here’s how to start on the path to financial success when 
you first enter the job market:
»
» Avoid consumer credit. The use and abuse of consumer credit can cause 
long-term financial pain and hardship. Shun making purchases on credit cards 
that you can’t pay for in full when the bill arrives. Here’s the simple solution 
for running up outstanding credit-card balances: Don’t carry a credit card. If 
you need the convenience of making purchases with a piece of plastic, get a 
debit card (see Chapter 3).
»
» Get in the habit of saving and investing. I’m often asked, “At what age 
should a person start saving?” To me, that’s similar to asking at what age you 
should start brushing your teeth. Well, when you have teeth to brush! So I say 
you should start saving and investing money from your first paycheck. Try 
saving 5 percent of every paycheck, and then eventually increase your savings 
rate to 10 percent. Ideally, you should put your savings into retirement 
accounts (through an automatic deduction) that offer tax benefits, unless you 
want to accumulate down-payment money for a home or small-business 
purchase. (You’re probably not thinking about buying a new home or retiring, 
though, if you’re just entering the job market.) If you’re having trouble saving 
money, track your spending and make cutbacks as needed (see Chapters 2 
and 5 for more assistance).
»
» Get insured. When you’re young and healthy, imagining yourself feeling 
otherwise may be difficult. But because accidents and unexpected illnesses 
can strike at any age, forgoing health insurance coverage can be financially 
devastating. When you’re in your first full-time job with limited benefits, 
buying disability coverage, which replaces income lost because of a long-term 
disability, is also wise. And as you begin to build your assets, make a will so 
your assets go where you want them to in the event of your untimely passing. 
(Check out Part 4 for more information about insurance.)
Educating and training your way  
to career success
The Bureau of Labor Statistics has data that clearly demonstrates that the more 
education a person has, the more money the person makes and the less likely the 
person is to be unemployed (see the most recent full year’s data and chart in 
Figure 9-1).

CHAPTER 9  Making the Most of Your Career      127
Now, you must be careful applying group data to your own situation, because 
assuming that more education is always better would be inaccurate. But the data 
clearly shows that more education is generally better, as it enhances your employ-
ability and income-earning potential and reduces your chances of being 
unemployed.
Seeking value for your education dollars
You and your family probably don’t have an unlimited supply of money to spend 
on furthering your education and training. So, just as with buying anything else — 
computers, clothing, and so on — you should look for value when spending your 
education dollars. Value means getting the most (quality) for your money.
Keep the following pointers in mind to ensure you get value for your educational 
dollars:
»
» Realize that you don’t always get what you pay for. Just because you 
spend more for education doesn’t mean that you’ll get better quality than 
something costing less. For example, the best state colleges and universities 
offer better value to in-state residents than do some private colleges and 
universities.
»
» Look beyond sticker prices. Because of the availability of financial aid, 
including grants and scholarships you don’t have to pay back, you can’t simply 
compare the sticker price of various schools and assume that the price is your 
FIGURE 9-1:

ment rates and

128      PART 2  Saving and Earning More
actual cost. Apply to a range of schools, apply for aid, and then compare your 
bottom-line cost at each school.
»
» Be careful when examining rankings of colleges and which colleges’ 
graduates earn the most. Lots of data and rankings on the best colleges and 
universities are available. One challenge when evaluating such data is that 
many of the highest-rated schools are private and quite expensive, and they 
selectively admit the most qualified candidates. So their graduates tend to 
earn more. Be sure to compare what each school provides and what each 
costs after factoring in financial aid awards.
»
» Consider employer assistance. Check out what education assistance your 
employer may offer. Just be sure that it makes sense for you and your career 
to stay with that employer for whatever additional time may be required.
»
» If you have specific fields of work in mind, research what education and 
training best prepares you. Talk to folks currently in those fields and 
consider training programs as well as technical training programs where 
appropriate.
Considering a liberal arts education  
and alternatives
First it’s helpful to define what is generally meant by a “liberal arts education.” 
My alma mater, Yale University, defines a liberal arts education as one that teaches 
students to think critically and express themselves clearly. Yale asserts that a 
­liberal arts education is a solid foundation for all professions and can help ­students 
lead successful and meaningful lives.
That sounds all well and good, and for some people, a liberal arts education may 
be a good fit. But for others, in our increasingly competitive global economy,  
I think there are some potentially better alternatives to consider.
Also, please keep in mind that many folks like myself, who attended the leading 
liberal arts colleges and universities, end up going on to graduate school for 
advanced degrees, for example in business, law, medicine, and so forth.
For some folks, a liberal arts degree can be a significant waste of time and money. 
Trade or technical schools (including community colleges) can provide specific 
training in particular areas such as automotive technology, carpentry, computer-
aided drafting and design, computer information systems, or manufacturing 
technology, or prepare you to become a dental technician, medical assistant, 
nurse, paramedic, or physical therapist.

CHAPTER 9  Making the Most of Your Career      129
Solid technical training has the advantage of providing skills that should lead to 
jobs upon graduation. The counterargument to getting technical training is that 
you’re more limited in the range of work you can potentially be considered quali-
fied to perform. And what if, for example, you are trained to be an auto mechanic 
and then end up hating the actual work after a few years of employment?
Also examine the various surveys that are done from time to time identifying 
occupations where the demand for new workers is exceeding the supply of such 
workers. For those who like to think opportunistically, consider the recent analy-
sis done by The Conference Board that shows future labor shortages that are 
expected to cluster around three major occupational groups:
»
» “Health-related occupations: The same aging of the U.S. population that will 
curtail working-age population growth to as low as 0.15 percent by 2030 is also 
driving up demand for medical workers. At the same time, high education and 
experience requirements limit entry into the job market. The result is a dearth 
in many healthcare professions, including occupational therapy assistants, 
physical therapists and therapist assistants, nurse practitioners and midwives, 
and dental hygienists. Among doctors, optometrists and podiatrists are the 
specialists most at risk of shortage, with the general physicians and surgeons 
category not far behind.”
»
» “Skilled labor occupations: These jobs typically require more than a 
high-school education, but not a bachelor’s degree. Unlike healthcare, the 
primary driver of shortages here is not increased demand — employment 
growth is expected to be low in the coming decade — but instead a rapidly 
shrinking supply of young people entering these fields as increasing numbers 
retire. Skilled labor occupations most at risk include water and wastewater 
treatment plant and system operators, crane and tower operators, transpor-
tation inspectors, and construction and building inspectors.”
»
» “STEM occupations: U.S. policymakers have long been concerned about 
shortages in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), but 
many of these fields rank surprisingly average in a national context. Moderating 
the risk of shortages is the relatively high number of young entrants compared 
to baby-boomer retirees, as well as the large proportion of new immigrants in 
STEM jobs. Moreover, strong productivity growth means that output will 
continue to expand in areas like information technology, telecommunications, 
and high-tech manufacturing even as workforces in these jobs are expected to 
shrink. Nevertheless, certain STEM fields — including mathematical science; 
information security; and civil, environmental, biomedical, and agricultural 
engineering — do face significant shortages.”

Learning the world’s number one 
universal language: Business
I think everyone can benefit from gaining background about business. It’s the 
universal language of the workplace. Even if you want to work for a nonprofit, you 
should understand concepts such as revenues, customer acquisition and service, 
marketing, expenses, financial statements, and so on.
If you’ve already completed your college degree or are attending a college that 
doesn’t offer business courses, don’t despair. You can learn about the world and 
language of business in numerous other ways:
»
» During the summers of your latter years of college and immediately after, go 
to work in business. Find the best organizations that you can, work hard, and 
be a sponge, soaking up all you can.
»
» Read the best business books and publications, especially those on small 
business and entrepreneurship if that’s what you’re most interested in. 
Among books that I recommend are those written by James C. Collins, my 
Small Business For Dummies (coauthored with Jim Schell and published by 
Wiley), the classic How to Win Friends & Influence People by Dale Carnegie 
(Pocket Books), The Greatest Salesman in the World by Og Mandino (Bantam), 
and How to Win at the Sport of Business by Mark Cuban (Diversion Publishing). 
Inc. Magazine is a monthly publication that has lots of worthwhile content, in 
print and on their website at www.inc.com.
»
» Take some free or very-low-cost online business courses from leading colleges 
and universities. You can do this through Coursera (which offers online 
courses from top universities like Northwestern, Stanford, the University of 
Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, and Yale), EdX, MIT’s OpenCourseWare, and 
Udacity. Also check out the short courses/videos offered by the U.S. Small 
Business Administration.
»
» Watch the best business television shows. Among those worth checking out 
are Shark Tank and The Profit.
»
» If you’re willing to spend money and want to take courses online, check out 
those offered by some of the leading online colleges, institutes, and universi-
ties (such as Kaplan and University of Maryland).
Investing in your career
In my work with financial counseling clients over the years and from observing 
friends and colleagues, I’ve witnessed plenty of people succeed in their careers. 
What did they have in common? They invested in their careers, and you can and 
should do the same. Some time-tested, proven ways to do that include

CHAPTER 9  Making the Most of Your Career      131
»
» Networking: Some people wait to network until they’ve been laid off or are 
really hungry to change jobs. Take an interest in what others do for a living 
and you’ll benefit and grow from the experience, even if you choose to stay 
with your current employer or in your chosen field. Online services like 
LinkedIn enable you to network and see what jobs you may qualify for.
»
» Making sure you keep growing: Whether it’s reading high-quality books or 
other publications, taking some night courses, or listening to good podcasts, 
find ways to build on your knowledge base.
»
» Considering the risk in the status quo: Many folks are resistant to change 
and get anxious thinking about what could go wrong when taking a new risk. 
When I was ready to walk away from a six-figure consulting job with a 
prestigious firm and open my own financial counseling firm, a number of my 
relatives and friends thought I had lost my mind. I’m glad I didn’t allow their 
fears and worries to dissuade me!
Exploring Entrepreneurial Options
Small business has generated more wealth than investing in the stock market or 
real estate. You can invest in small business by starting a business yourself, buy-
ing an existing business, or investing in someone else’s small business. The fol-
lowing sections give you an overview in doing so.
Starting a small business
When you have self-discipline and a product or service you can sell, starting your 
own business can be both profitable and fulfilling. Before you start, consider the 
following:
»
» Determine what skills and expertise you possess that you can use in 
your business. You don’t need a unique idea or invention to start a 
small business.
»
» Begin exploring your idea by first developing a written business plan. 
Such a plan should detail your product or service, how you’re going to market 
it, your potential customers and competitors, and the economics of the 
business, including the start-up costs.
Of all the small-business investment options, starting your own business involves 
the most work. Although you can do this work on a part-time basis in the begin-
ning, most people end up running their business full time — it’s your new job.

132      PART 2  Saving and Earning More
In most people’s eyes, starting a new business is the riskiest of all small-business 
investment options. But if you’re going into a business that uses your skills and 
expertise, the risk isn’t nearly as great as you may think. Many businesses can be 
started with little cash by leveraging your existing skills and expertise. You can 
build a valuable company and job if you have the time to devote to it. To begin your 
own business, check out the latest edition of Small Business For Dummies (Wiley), 
which I cowrote.
Purchasing a small business
If you don’t have a specific product or service you want to sell but you’re skilled at 
managing and improving the operations of a company, buying a small business 
may be for you. Finding and buying a good small business takes time and patience, 
so devote at least several months to the search. You may also need to enlist finan-
cial and legal advisors to help inspect the company, look over its financial state-
ments, and hammer out a contract.
Good businesses don’t come cheap. If the business is a success, the current owner 
has already removed the start-up risk from the business, so the price of the busi-
ness should be at a premium to reflect this lack of risk. When you have the money 
to buy an established business and you have the skills to run it, consider going this 
route.
Although you don’t have to go through the riskier start-up period if you buy a 
small business, you’ll likely need more capital to buy an established enterprise. 
You’ll also need to be able to deal with stickier personnel and management issues. 
The organization’s history and the way it works will predate your ownership of 
the business. If you don’t like making hard decisions, firing people who don’t fit 
with your plans, and getting people to change the way they do things, buying an 
existing business likely isn’t for you.
Some people perceive buying an existing business as being safer than starting a 
new one. Buying someone else’s business can actually be riskier. You’re likely to 
shell out far more money upfront, in the form of a down payment. If you don’t 
have the ability to run the business and it does poorly, you have more to lose 
financially. In addition, the business may be for sale for a reason — it may not be 
very profitable, it may be in decline, or it may generally be a pain in the neck to 
operate.
Investing in a small business
If you don’t want the day-to-day headaches of being directly responsible for 
owning and managing a business but you do like the idea of profiting from a 

CHAPTER 9  Making the Most of Your Career      133
successful one, then investing in someone else’s small business may be for you. 
Although this route may seem easier, few people are actually cut out to be inves-
tors in other people’s businesses. The reason: Finding and analyzing opportuni-
ties isn’t easy.
Are you astute at evaluating corporate financial statements and business strate-
gies? Investing in a small, privately held company has much in common with 
investing in a publicly traded firm (as is the case when you buy stock), but it also 
has these differences:
»
» Private firms aren’t required to produce comprehensive, audited 
financial statements that adhere to certain accounting principles. Thus, 
you have a greater risk of not having sufficient or accurate information when 
evaluating a small, private firm.
»
» Unearthing private, small-business investing opportunities is harder. The 
best private companies that are seeking investors generally don’t advertise. 
Instead, they find prospective investors by networking with people such as 
business advisors. You can increase your chances of finding private compa-
nies to invest in by speaking with tax, legal, and financial advisors who work 
with small businesses. You can also find interesting opportunities through 
your own contacts or your experience within a given industry.
Consider investing in someone else’s business only if you can afford to lose all of 
what you invest. Also, you should have sufficient assets so that whatever money 
you invest in small, privately held companies represents only a small portion (20 
percent or less) of your total financial assets.
Changing Jobs or Careers
During your adult life, you’ll almost surely change jobs — perhaps several times 
a decade. I hope that most of the time you change jobs by your own choice. But in 
today’s increasingly global and rapidly changing economy, job security isn’t great. 
Downsizing has affected even the most talented workers.
Always be prepared for a job change. No matter how happy you are in your current 
job, knowing that your world won’t fall apart if you’re not working tomorrow can 
give you an added sense of security and encourage openness to possibility. Whether 
you change your job by choice or necessity, the following financial maneuvers can 
help ease the transition:
»
» Keep your spending lean. Spending less than you earn always makes good 
financial sense, but if you’re approaching a possible job change, spending less 

134      PART 2  Saving and Earning More
is even more important, particularly if you’re entering a new field or starting 
your own company and you expect a short-term income dip. Many people 
view a lifestyle of thriftiness as restrictive, but ultimately, those thrifty habits 
can give you more freedom to do what you want to do.
»
» Keep an emergency reserve fund. You should have a “rainy day” fund to 
deal with emergencies and the inevitable curveballs that life throws your way. 
I suggest keeping it in a money market fund or savings account, and it should 
cover at least three months’ worth of living expenses.
»
» Evaluate the total financial picture when relocating. At some point in your 
career, you may have the option of relocating. But don’t call the moving 
company until you understand the financial consequences of such a move. 
You can’t simply compare salaries and benefits between the two jobs. You 
also need to compare the cost of living between the two areas, which includes 
housing, commuting, state income and property taxes, food, utilities, and all 
the other major expenditure categories. There are various cost-of-living 
calculators online that enable you to compare different locations.
»
» Track your job-search expenses for tax purposes. If you’re seeking a new 
job in your current (or recently current) field of work, your job-search 
expenses may be tax-deductible, even if you don’t get a specific job you 
desire. If you’re moving into a new career, your job-search expenses aren’t 
tax-deductible.
The Young and the Unemployed
Your job search may play out like a daytime drama, which is no surprise if you’re 
having a difficult time finding a job. But being unemployed means you need to be 
especially concerned with your personal finances. The following sections point 
out why unemployment strikes younger people harder and what you can do dur-
ing this rough time.
Understanding how joblessness 
can hit younger adults harder
During the severe recession from 2007–2009, high unemployment rates were all 
over the news as the unemployment rate surpassed 10 percent in the United States. 
But that double-digit level of joblessness paled in comparison to the high level of 
unemployment for young people, especially those who were less well educated.

CHAPTER 9  Making the Most of Your Career      135
Despite the multi-year expansion that the U.S. economy has enjoyed since 2009, 
the youngest adults (those under 25) have continued to have higher levels of 
unemployment than the rest of the working adult population. Adults without a 
high-school diploma have an unemployment rate far greater than the average, 
followed by high-school graduates who have no college experience. College grad-
uates have by far the lowest unemployment rate. (Figure 9-1 earlier in the chapter 
helps you understand the rate of unemployment and average weekly earnings 
based on education level.)
The typical out-of-work person tends to be young and not well educated. Although 
you can’t do anything about your age, you can do something about your education 
(see the earlier section “Getting Your Career Going”).
Accessing unemployment benefits
If you’re laid off and unemployed, you should collect unemployment benefits if 
you’re eligible. You must be actively seeking employment and meet any other 
eligibility requirements in your state.
The simplest way to find the state unemployment insurance office nearest you is 
to visit the website www.servicelocator.org and click Unemployment Benefits 
on the home page. CareerOneStop operates this site  — a U.S.  Department of 
Labor–sponsored website that provides “career resources and workforce infor-
mation to job seekers, students, businesses, and workforce professionals to foster 
talent development in a global economy.”
Unemployment benefits are provided at the state level, and each state has its own 
program. If you’re turned down for benefits, be sure to clarify why, and don’t be 
shy about appealing the decision if you feel there’s a chance you may get approved 
if you’re able to furnish more information.
Taking action
You can make the most of your finances and be best prepared to handle life’s chal-
lenges if you stay on top of your financial affairs. That said, losing one’s job often 
comes as a surprise and presents some unusual stresses. Here are some tips to 
keep in mind if you lose your job:
»
» Batten down the hatches. Evaluating and slashing your current level of 
spending may be necessary. Everything should be fair game, from how much 
you spend on housing to how often you eat out to where you do your grocery 
shopping. Avoid at all costs the temptation to maintain your level of spending 
by accumulating consumer debt.

136      PART 2  Saving and Earning More
»
» Work at your job search a few hours daily but not on a full-time basis. 
Searching for a job is hard work and creates stress for most people. You’re 
probably not going to make the most of your job search by making it your 
full-time endeavor. Make some calls; arrange some appointments; send some 
résumés; and do some research on industries, companies, and organizations 
of interest every day. But I suggest doing so for no more than four to six hours 
per day. If you can find part-time or temporary work, spend some time doing 
that to earn some money and to break up the monotony of looking for work.
»
» Try to exercise regularly. Exercise clears the head and lifts your mood. Daily 
exercise is best, but if that’s not possible, try to get some exercise at least 
every other day.
»
» Eat healthfully. As with exercise, eating a balanced and nutritious diet can go 
a long way toward maximizing your mental (and physical) health and outlook.

Successful Investing 
Principles
O
ne of the most important financial tasks you’ll tackle in your 20s and 30s 
is investing money you’ve worked hard to earn and save. Investing wisely 
takes knowledge, discipline, and a sound philosophy. The good news: This 
chapter can help you get and stay on the right path.
Understanding Investments
Ignore, for a moment, all the specific investments you’ve ever heard of. Having a 
basic grasp of the investment world is important, so I simplify it for you in the 
following sections. You have two major investment choices: You can be a lender or 
an owner.
Examining bonds and other  
lending investments
When you invest your money in a bank certificate of deposit (CD), a Treasury bill, or 
a bond issued by a company — such as the energy giant Exxon Mobil, for example — 
you’re a lender. In each case, you lend your money to an organization — a bank, the 

140      PART 3  Investing for Your Future Goals
federal government, or Exxon Mobil. The organization pays you an agreed-upon rate 
of interest for lending your money and promises to return your original investment 
(the principal) on a specific date.
Getting paid all the interest in addition to getting back your original investment 
(as promised) is your hoped-for outcome when you make a lending investment. 
Given that the investment landscape is littered with carcasses of failed invest-
ments, however, this result isn’t guaranteed. The following sections outline what 
happens when you invest in bonds and discuss some lending drawbacks.
Investing in bonds
When you invest in a newly issued bond, you lend your money to an organization. 
The bond includes a specified maturity date — the time at which the principal is 
repaid — and a particular interest rate, or what’s known as a coupon. This rate is 
fixed on most bonds. So, for example, if you buy a ten-year, 5 percent bond issued 
by Boeing, the aircraft manufacturer, you’re lending your money to Boeing for ten 
years at an interest rate of 5 percent per year. (Bond interest is usually paid in two 
equal, semiannual installments.)
Some types of bonds have higher yields than others, but the risk-reward relationship 
remains intact. A bond generally pays you a higher rate of interest when it has a
»
» Lower credit rating: To compensate for the higher risk of default and the 
higher likelihood of losing your investment
»
» Longer-term maturity (how many years until bondholders are paid 
back): To compensate for the risk that you’ll be unhappy with the bond’s set 
interest rate if the market level of interest rates moves up
A bond’s value generally moves opposite of the directional change in interest 
rates. For example, if you’re holding a bond issued at 5 percent and rates increase 
to 6 percent on comparable, newly issued bonds, your bond decreases in value. 
(Why would anyone want to buy your bond at the price you paid if it yields just  
5 percent when 6 percent can be obtained elsewhere?)
Bonds differ from one another in the following major ways:
»
» The type of institution to which you lend your money: With municipal 
bonds, you lend your money to a state or local government or agency; with 
Treasuries, you lend your money to the federal government; with corporate 
bonds, you lend your money to a corporation.
»
» The credit quality of the borrower to which you lend your money: Credit 
quality is a measurement of the likelihood that the borrower will default on 

CHAPTER 10  Successful Investing Principles      141
the interest and principal you’re owed. Knowing this information is important 
because higher-credit-rating bonds are generally safer but pay lower rates of 
interest.
»
» The length of the bond’s maturity: Short-term bonds mature within 5 years, 
intermediate bonds mature within 5 to 10 years, and long-term bonds mature 
within 30 years. Longer-term bonds generally pay higher yields but fluctuate 
more with changes in interest rates.
»
» The bond’s callability: Callability means that the bond’s issuer can decide to 
pay you back earlier than the previously agreed-upon date. This event usually 
occurs when interest rates fall and the bond issuer wants to issue new, 
lower-interest-rate bonds to replace the higher-rate bonds outstanding. To 
compensate you for early repayment, the bond’s issuer typically gives you a 
small premium over what the bond is currently valued at.
Considering the downsides to lending
Many folks think that lending investments are safe and without risk, which is 
wrong. Lending money has the following disadvantages:
»
» You may not get what you’re promised. When a company goes bankrupt, 
for example, you can lose all or part of your original investment.
»
» Your money’s purchasing power may be reduced by inflation. Many folks 
have grown complacent with the low inflation the United States has enjoyed 
for quite some time. But what if inflation increases to 6 percent per year, or 
even 10 percent per year, as it last did in the early 1980s? After a decade of 
that much inflation, the purchasing power of your money drops 44 percent at 
6 percent annual inflation and a whopping 61 percent at 10 percent yearly 
inflation. Also, the value of a bond may drop below what you paid for it if 
interest rates rise or the quality/risk of the issuing company declines.
»
» You don’t share in the upside of the organization to which you lend your 
money. If a company grows in size and profits, your principal and interest 
rate don’t grow along with it; they stay the same. Of course, such success 
should ensure that you get your promised interest and principal.
Exploring stocks, real estate,  
and small-business investments
The three best ways to build long-term wealth are to invest in ownership invest-
ments: stocks, real estate, and small business. I’ve found this to be true from my 
own personal experiences and from observing many clients and other investors 
over the decades. The following sections outline these three ways in greater depth.

142      PART 3  Investing for Your Future Goals
Socking your money away in stocks
Stocks, which represent shares of ownership in a company, are the most common 
ownership investment vehicle. You’re an owner when you invest your money in an 
asset, such as a company or real estate, that has the ability to generate earnings 
or profits. Suppose that you own 100 shares of American Express stock. With bil-
lions of shares of stock outstanding, American Express is a mighty big company — 
your 100 shares represent a tiny piece of it.
What do you get for your small slice of American Express? As a stockholder, you 
share in the company’s profits in the form of dividends (quarterly cash payments 
to shareholders from the company) and an increase (you hope) in the stock price 
if the company grows and becomes more profitable. Of course, you receive these 
benefits if things are going well. If American Express’s business declines, your 
stock may be worth less (or even worthless!).
As the economy grows and companies grow with it and earn greater profits, stock 
prices and dividend payouts on those stocks generally increase. Stock prices and 
dividends don’t move in lockstep with earnings, but over the years, the relation-
ship is pretty close.
In fact, the price-earnings ratio — which measures the level of stock prices relative 
to (or divided by) company earnings — of U.S. stocks has averaged approximately 
15 the past two centuries (although it tends to be higher during periods of low 
inflation). A price-earnings ratio of 15 simply means that shares of a company’s 
stock, on average, are selling at about 15 times the company’s earnings per share.
When companies go public, they issue shares of stock that people can purchase on 
the major stock exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange. Companies that 
issue stock are called publicly held companies. By contrast, some companies are ­privately 
held, which means that they’ve elected to sell their stock only to senior management 
and a small number of invited, affluent investors. Privately held companies’ stocks 
don’t trade on a stock exchange, thus limiting who can be a shareholder.
Not only can you invest in company stocks that trade on the U.S. stock exchanges, 
but you can also invest in stocks overseas. Many investing opportunities exist 
overseas. If you look at the total value of all stocks outstanding worldwide, the 
value of U.S. stocks is in the minority.
A good reason for investing in international stocks is that when you confine your 
investing to U.S. securities, you miss a world of opportunities, like taking advan-
tage of business growth in other countries, as well as diversifying your portfolio 
even further. (For more on diversification, see the later section “Spreading Your 
Investment Risks.”) International securities markets traditionally haven’t moved 
in tandem with U.S. markets.

CHAPTER 10  Successful Investing Principles      143
Investing in the stock market involves setbacks and difficult periods, but the 
overall journey should be worth the effort. Over the past two centuries, the U.S. 
stock market has produced an annual average rate of return of about 9 percent 
(which translates into about 6 percent per year after subtracting inflation). How-
ever, as anyone who has invested in stocks over the years has experienced first-
hand, stocks can drop sharply — worldwide, stocks were sliced approximately in 
half during the down market that ended in early 2009. So if you can withstand 
down markets here and there over the course of many years, the stock market is a 
proven place to invest for long-term growth.
You can invest in stocks (and bonds, which I discuss earlier in this chapter) by 
making your own selection of individual stocks or by letting a mutual (or 
exchange-traded) fund do the selecting for you.
INVESTING IN INDIVIDUAL STOCKS
Who wouldn’t want to own shares in the next hot stock? Few things are more 
financially satisfying than investing in a stock like Apple or Amazon that multi-
plies your money many, many times over the years.
But investing in individual stocks entails numerous pitfalls:
»
» You may fool yourself (or let others fool you) into thinking that picking 
and following individual companies and their stocks is simple and 
requires little time.
When you’re considering the purchase of an individual security, you should 
spend a significant amount of time doing research. You need to know a lot 
about the company in which you’re thinking about investing. Relevant 
questions to ask about the company include: What products does it sell? What 
are its prospects for future growth and profitability? How much debt does it 
have? You need to do your homework not only before you make your initial 
investment but also on an ongoing basis for as long as you hold the invest-
ment. Research takes your valuable free time and sometimes costs money.
»
» Your emotions will probably get in your way. Analyzing financial state-
ments, corporate strategy, and competitive position requires great intellect 
and insight. However, those skills aren’t nearly enough. Will you have the 
stomach to hold on after what you thought was a sure-win stock plunges 50 
percent? Will you have the courage to dump such a stock if your new research 
suggests that the plummet is the beginning of the end rather than just a 
bump in the road? When your money’s on the line, emotions often undermine 
your ability to make sound, long-term decisions. Few people have the 
psychological constitution to handle the financial markets.

144      PART 3  Investing for Your Future Goals
»
» You’re less likely to diversify. Unless you have tens of thousands of dollars 
to invest in dozens of different stocks, you probably can’t cost-effectively 
afford to develop a diversified portfolio. When investing in stocks, for exam-
ple, you should hold companies in different industries and different compa-
nies within an industry. (Diversifying is easier and less costly to do if you invest 
some of your money in the best mutual funds and exchange-traded funds in 
addition to individual stocks.) By not diversifying, you unnecessarily add to 
your risk. (For more on diversification, see the later section “Spreading Your 
Investment Risks.”)
»
» You’ll face accounting and bookkeeping hassles. When you invest in 
individual securities outside of retirement accounts, every time you sell a 
security, you must report that transaction on your tax return.
Investing in individual securities should be done only by those who really enjoy 
doing it and are aware of and willing to accept the risks in doing so. Researching 
individual stocks can be more than a full-time job, and if you choose to take this 
path, remember that you’ll be competing against the professionals who do so on 
a full-time basis. I recommend that you limit your individual stock picking to no 
more than 20 percent of your overall investments.
DISCOVERING THE ADVANTAGES OF MUTUAL FUNDS AND ETFs
Mutual funds (investment pools that hold a collection of securities such as bonds 
and stocks) span the spectrum of risk and potential returns, from stable-value 
money market funds (which are similar to savings accounts) to bond funds (which 
generally pay higher yields than money market funds but fluctuate with changes 
in interest rates) to stock funds (which offer the greatest potential for apprecia-
tion but also the greatest short-term volatility).
Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are similar to mutual funds except that they trade on 
a major stock exchange and, unlike mutual funds, can be bought and sold during 
the trading day. The best ETFs have low fees, and like an index fund (which invests 
in a fixed mix of securities that track a specific market index), they invest to track 
the performance of a stock market index.
Efficiently managed mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, if properly 
selected, are a low-cost way for investors of both modest and substantial means 
to hire professional money managers. See Chapter  12 for sample portfolios of 
funds. Over the long haul, you’re not going to beat full-time professional manag-
ers who invest in securities of the same type and risk level.

CHAPTER 10  Successful Investing Principles      145
LEVERAGED AND INVERSE EXCHANGE-
TRADED FUNDS AREN’T INVESTMENTS
Since their introduction in 2006, leveraged and inverse exchange-traded funds (ETFs) 
have taken tens of billions of dollars in assets. Leveraged ETFs purport to magnify the 
move of a particular index, for example the Standard & Poors 500 stock index, by 
double or even triple in some cases. So, a double-leveraged S&P 500 ETF is supposed to 
increase by 2 percent for a 1 percent increase in the S&P 500 index.
Inverse ETFs are supposed to move in the opposite direction of a given index. So, for 
example, an inverse S&P 500 ETF is supposed to increase by 1 percent for a 1 percent 
decrease in the S&P 500 index.
The steep 2008 decline in stock market indexes around the globe and increasing volatil-
ity theoretically created the perfect environment for leveraged and inverse ETFs. With 
these new vehicles, you could easily make money from major stock market indexes 
when they were falling. Or, if you were convinced a particular index or industry group 
was about to zoom higher, you could buy a leveraged ETF that would magnify market 
moves two- or even three-fold.
Suppose back in early 2008, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average had declined about 
10 percent from its then-recent peak above 14,000, you were starting to get nervous 
and wanted to protect your portfolio from a major market decline. So, you bought some 
of the ProShares UltraShort Dow 30 ETF (trading symbol DXD), which is an inverse ETF 
designed to move twice as much in the opposite direction as the Dow. So, if the Dow 
goes down, DXD goes up twice as much and you make money.
This ETF did indeed rise sharply when the Dow fell sharply in mid to late 2008. By late 
2008, with the Dow down about 40 percent, the ETF, rather than being up 80 percent, 
was only up about 50 percent. In early 2010 — two years after you bought the ETF in 
early 2008 — the Dow was down about 20 percent. So if you held on that long, your 
original thinking — that the market was going to fall — proved to be correct. If the ETF 
did what it was supposed to do and moved twice as much in the other direction, it 
should have increased 40 percent in value over this period, thus giving you a tidy return. 
But, it didn’t — not even close. The ETF actually plummeted nearly 50 percent in value!
My overall investigations of whether the leveraged (and inverse) ETFs actually deliver on 
their objectives shows that they don’t. Over the years, ETF issuers have come out with 
increasingly risky and costly ETFs. Leveraged and inverse ETFs are especially problematic.
Buried in the fine print of the prospectuses of these ETFs, it usually says that these ETFs 
are only designed to accomplish their stated objectives for one trading day, so they are

Generating wealth with real estate
Real estate is another financially rewarding and time-honored ownership invest-
ment. Real estate can produce profits when you rent it for more than the expense 
of owning the property, or you sell it at a price higher than what you paid for it.  
I know numerous successful real-estate investors (myself included) who’ve 
earned excellent long-term profits.
Over the generations, real-estate owners and investors have enjoyed rates of 
return comparable to those produced by the stock market. However, like stocks, 
real estate goes through good and bad performance periods. Most people who 
make money investing in real estate do so because they invest over many years 
and do their homework when they buy to ensure that they purchase good property 
at an attractive price.
The value of real estate depends not only on the particulars of the individual prop-
erty but also on the health and performance of the local economy. When compa-
nies in the community are growing and more jobs are being produced at higher 
wages, real estate does well. When local employers are laying people off and excess 
housing is vacant because of overbuilding, rent and property values fall.
Buying your own home is a good place to start investing in real estate. The equity 
in your home (the difference between the home’s market value and the loan you 
owe on it) that builds over the years can become a significant part of your net 
worth. Over your adult life, owning a home should be less expensive than renting 
a comparable home. See Chapter 7 for the details on buying and financing your 
home.
only really suitable for day traders! Of course, few investors read the dozens of pages of 
legal boilerplate in a prospectus.
Leveraged and inverse ETFs are not investments. They are gambling instruments for 
day traders.
For you as an individual investor, if you happen to guess right before a short-term major 
market move, you may do well over a short period of time (longer than one day but no 
more than a few months) but the odds are heavily stacked against you.
You can reduce risk through sensible diversification. If you don’t want 80 percent of 
your portfolio exposed to stock market risk, invest a percentage you’re comfortable with 
and don’t waste your time and money with leveraged and inverse ETFs.

CHAPTER 10  Successful Investing Principles      147
REAL ESTATE’S ATTRIBUTES
Real estate differs from most other investments in several respects. Here are real 
estate’s unique attributes:
»
» Usability: Real estate is the only investment you can use (living in or renting 
out) to produce income. You can’t live in a stock, bond, or mutual fund!
»
» Less buildable land: The demand for land and housing continues to grow 
with population growth. Scarcer land propels real-estate prices higher over 
the long term.
»
» Zoning determinations: Local government regulates the zoning of property, 
and zoning determines what a property can be used for. In most communi-
ties, local zoning boards are against big growth. This position bodes well for 
future real-estate values. In some cases, a particular property may not have 
been developed to its full potential. If you can figure out how to develop the 
property, you can reap large profits.
»
» Leverage with debt usage: Real estate is also different from other invest-
ments because you can borrow a lot of money to buy it — up to 80 percent or 
more of the property’s value. This borrowing is known as exercising leverage: 
With an investment of 20 percent down, you’re able to purchase and own a 
much larger investment. If the value of your real estate goes up, you make 
money on your investment and on the money you borrowed. (Of course, the 
reverse happens when real-estate prices go down.)
»
» Diamonds in the rough: Real-estate markets can be inefficient at times. 
Information isn’t always easy to come by, and you may encounter a highly 
motivated or uninformed seller. Do your homework and you may be able to 
reap the rewards of purchasing a property below its fair market value.
»
» Favorable tax treatment: The tax code preferentially provides additional tax 
deductions, exclusions, or deferrals of taxes on gains on many types of real 
estate that aren’t available on other types of investments.
Just as with any other investment, real estate has its drawbacks. Buying and sell-
ing a property takes time and is costly. When you’re renting property, you dis-
cover firsthand the occasional headaches of being a landlord. And especially in the 
early years of rental-property ownership, the property’s expenses may exceed the 
rental income, producing a net cash drain.
ATTRACTIVE REAL-ESTATE INVESTMENTS
You can invest in homes, duplexes, or small apartment buildings and then rent 
them out. In the long run, investment-property buyers usually see their rental 
income increase faster than their expenses and the value of their property increase. 

148      PART 3  Investing for Your Future Goals
So successful investment-property owners make money monthly and yearly from 
the cash flow on their properties as well as when they someday sell their invest-
ment property for more than they paid for it.
When selecting real estate for investment purposes, remember that local eco-
nomic growth is the fuel for housing demand. In addition to a vibrant and diverse 
job base, you want to look for limited supplies of both existing housing and land 
on which to build. When you identify potential properties in which you may want 
to invest, run the numbers to understand the cash demands of owning the prop-
erty and the likely profitability.
If you don’t want to be a landlord — one of the biggest drawbacks of investment 
real estate — consider real-estate investment trusts (REITs). REITs are diversified 
real-estate investment companies that purchase and manage rental real estate for 
investors. A typical REIT invests in different types of property, such as shopping 
centers, apartments, and other rental buildings. You can invest in REITs either by 
purchasing them directly on the major stock exchanges or by investing in a real-
estate mutual fund that invests in numerous REITs.
For more information regarding investing in properties, check out my book, Real 
Estate Investing For Dummies (coauthored by Robert S. Griswold and published by 
Wiley).
Going the small-business investment route
Many folks have also built substantial wealth through small business. You can 
participate in small business in a variety of ways. You can start your own business, 
buy and operate an existing business, or simply invest in promising small busi-
nesses. See Chapter 9 for more details.
Getting a Handle on Investment Risks
Many investors have a simplistic understanding of what risk means and how to 
apply it to their investment decisions. Having a firm handle on investment risk 
and what it means to you in your young-adult years and as you age is important.
For example, when compared to the gyrations of the stock market, a bank savings 
account may seem like a less risky place to put your money. Over the long term, 
however, the stock market usually beats the rate of inflation, while the interest 
rate on a savings account does not. Thus, if you’re saving your money for a long-
term goal like retirement, a savings account can be a “riskier” place to put your 

CHAPTER 10  Successful Investing Principles      149
money than a diversified stock portfolio. The following sections take a closer look 
at determining what you want and identifying potential risks.
Establishing goals and risks
Before you select a specific investment, first determine your investment needs 
and goals. Ask yourself: Why are you saving money? What are you going to use it 
for? Establishing objectives is important because the expected use of the money 
helps you determine which investments to choose.
For example, suppose you’ve been accumulating money for a down payment on a 
home you want to buy in a few years. You can’t afford much risk with that money. 
You’re going to need that money sooner rather than later. Putting that money in 
the stock market, then, is foolish because the stock market can drop a lot in a year 
or over several consecutive years.
By contrast, when saving toward a longer-term goal that’s decades away, such as 
retirement, you’re better able to make riskier investments, because your holdings 
have more time to bounce back from temporary losses or setbacks. You may want 
to consider investing in growth investments, such as stocks, in a retirement 
account that you leave alone for many years.
Comparing the risks of stocks and bonds
Given the relatively higher historic returns for ownership investments like stocks, 
some people think that they should put all their money in stocks and real estate. 
So what’s the catch?
The risk with ownership investments is the short-term drops in their value. During 
the last century, stocks declined, on average, by more than 10 percent once every five 
calendar years. Drops in stock prices of more than 20 percent occurred, on average, 
once every ten calendar years. Real-estate prices suffer similar periodic setbacks.
Therefore, in order to earn those generous long-term returns from ownership 
investments like stocks and real estate, you must be willing to tolerate volatility. 
You absolutely should not put all your money in the stock or real-estate market. 
You shouldn’t invest your emergency money or money you expect to use within 
the next five years in such volatile investments.
The shorter the time period that you have for holding your money in an invest-
ment, the less likely growth-oriented investments like stocks are to beat out 
lending-type investments like bonds.

150      PART 3  Investing for Your Future Goals
SHOULD YOU INVEST IN BITCOIN AND 
OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCIES?
Perhaps you have heard of Bitcoin — the digital “currency.” I find that far more young 
adults know about it than older folks do. That makes sense since it’s a digital currency 
used for Internet transactions.
Increasingly, Bitcoin has been making the news more and more as its price climbs to 
ever dizzying heights. In August 2017, the price of a Bitcoin breached the $4,000 mark.
So, what exactly is Bitcoin? For starters, it’s not actually a coin — that’s a marketing gim-
mick to make it sound like a real currency. Bitcoin and other similar cryptocurrrencies 
only exist in the online world. Bitcoin’s creators have limited the number of Bitcoins that 
can be mined and put into online circulation to about 21 million.
As its promoters have talked up its usefulness and dizzying rise, many people who have 
Bitcoins continue to hold onto them like shares of stock in the next Amazon.com or 
Apple, hoping for and expecting further steep price increases. People don’t hoard real 
currencies with similar pie-in-the-sky hopes for large investment returns.
Online Bitcoin transactions can be done anonymously and they can’t be contested, dis-
puted, or reversed. So, if you buy something using Bitcoin and have a problem with the 
item you bought, that’s too bad — you have no recourse, unlike, for example, a pur-
chase made on your credit card. The clandestine nature of cryptocurrencies makes 
them attractive to folks trying to hide money or engaged in illegal activities (criminals, 
drug dealers, and the like).
As of August 2017, about $140 billion was tied up in these cryptocurrencies — a 
more than six-fold increase in the amount held at the end of 2016, according to 
CoinMarketCap.com.
So what is a given cryptocurrency like Bitcoin worth? Cryptocurrencies have no inherent 
value. Contrast that with gold. Not only has gold had a long history of being used as a 
medium of exchange (currency), gold has commercial and industrial uses. Furthermore, 
gold costs real money to mine out of the ground, which provides a floor of support 
under the price of gold in the range of $800 to $900 per ounce, not far below the price 
of gold at about $1,280 per ounce at the time of this writing.
The supply of Bitcoin is currently artificially limited. And Bitcoin is hardly unique — it’s 
one of hundreds of cryptocurrencies. So if another cryptocurrency is easier to use 
online and perceived as attractive (in part because it’s far less expensive), Bitcoin will 
tumble in value.

CHAPTER 10  Successful Investing Principles      151
When you invest in stocks and other growth-oriented investments, you must 
accept the volatility of these investments. That said, you can take several actions, 
which I discuss in this chapter and in Chapter 12, to greatly reduce your risk when 
investing in these higher potential–return investments. Invest the money that 
you have earmarked for the longer term in these vehicles. Minimize the risk of 
these investments through diversification. Don’t buy just one or two stocks; buy a 
number of stocks. Keep reading for more information about diversification.
Spreading Your Investment Risks
Diversification is a powerful investment concept. It refers to placing your money in 
different investments with returns that aren’t completely correlated. This is a 
fancy way of saying that when some of your investments are down in value, odds 
are that others are up in value.
To decrease the chances of all your investments getting clobbered at the same 
time, put your money in different types of investments, such as bonds, stocks, 
real estate, and small business. You can further diversify your investments by 
investing in domestic as well as international markets.
The following sections point out why diversifying your investments is important, 
how you can do it, and why you should avoid the temptation to toss investments 
that are down during certain times.
Even though Bitcoin has been the most popular cryptocurrency in recent years, few 
merchants actually accept it. And, to add insult to injury, Bitcoin users get whacked with 
unfavorable conversion rates, which add greatly to the effective price of items bought 
with Bitcoin.
In India, a country with more than one billion people, a new frictionless payment 
system — India Stack — threatens to unseat Bitcoin there.
I can’t tell you what will happen to Bitcoin’s price next month, next year, or next decade. 
But I can tell that it has virtually no inherent value as a digital currency, so those paying 
thousands of dollars for a Bitcoin will eventually be very disappointed. There are nearly 
1,000 of these cryptocurrencies, and the field keeps growing as creators hope to get in 
on the ground floor of the next cryptocurrency that they hope will soar in value.

152      PART 3  Investing for Your Future Goals
Understanding why diversification is key
Within a given class of investments, such as stocks, investing in different types of 
that class (such as different types of stocks) that perform well under various eco-
nomic conditions is important. For this reason, mutual funds and exchange-
traded funds, which are diversified portfolios of securities such as stocks or bonds, 
are a highly useful investment vehicle. When you buy into funds, your money is 
pooled with the money of many others and invested in a vast array of stocks or 
bonds.
Diversification reduces the volatility in the value of your whole portfolio. In other 
words, your portfolio can achieve the same rate of return that a single investment 
might typically provide with less fluctuation in value.
Keep in mind that no one, no matter whom he works for or what credentials he 
has, can guarantee returns on an investment. You can do good research and get 
lucky, but no one is free from the risk of losing money. Diversification allows you 
to reduce the risk of unnecessarily large losses from your investments.
Allocating your assets
Asset allocation refers to how you spread your investing dollars among different 
investment options (stocks, bonds, money market accounts, and so on). Over the 
long term, the asset allocation decision is the most important determinant of total 
return and risk for a diversified portfolio. Before you can intelligently decide how 
to allocate your assets, you need to ponder a number of issues, including your 
present financial situation, your goals and priorities, and the pros and cons of 
various investment options.
Although stocks and real estate offer attractive long-term returns, they can some-
times suffer significant declines. Thus, these investments aren’t suitable for 
money that you think you may want or need to use within, say, the next five years.
Money market funds and shorter-term bond investments are good places to keep 
money that you expect to use soon. Everyone should have a reserve of money — 
about three to six months’ worth of living expenses in a money market fund — 
that he or she can access in an emergency. Shorter-term bonds or bond mutual 
funds can serve as a higher-yielding, secondary emergency cushion.
Investing money for retirement is a classic long-term goal that most people have. 
Your current age and the number of years until you retire are the biggest factors 
to consider when allocating money for long-term purposes. The younger you are 
and the more years you have before retirement, the more comfortable you should 
be with growth-oriented (and more volatile) investments, such as stocks and 

CHAPTER 10  Successful Investing Principles      153
investment real estate. Bonds can also be useful for diversification purposes. For 
example, when investing for retirement, placing a portion of your money in bonds 
helps buffer stock market declines.
A useful guideline for dividing or allocating your money between longer-term- 
oriented growth investments, such as stocks, and more-conservative lending 
investments, such as bonds, is to subtract your age from 110 (or 120 if you want to 
be aggressive; 100 to be more conservative) and invest the resulting percentage in 
stocks. You then invest the remaining amount in bonds.
For example, if you’re 25, you invest from 75 (100 – 25) to 95 (120 – 25) percent 
in stocks. You invest the portion left over — 5 to 25 percent — in bonds. Consider 
allocating a percentage of your stock-fund money to overseas investments: at 
least 20 percent to as much as 50 percent for more aggressive investors.
Holding onto your investments  
and shunning the herd
The allocation of your investment dollars should be driven by your goals and 
desire to take risk. As you get older, gradually scaling back on the riskiness (and, 
therefore, growth potential) of your portfolio generally makes sense.
Don’t tinker with your portfolio daily, weekly, monthly, or even annually. Every 
three to five years or so, you may want to rebalance your holdings to get your mix 
to a desired asset allocation, as I discuss in the preceding section. Don’t trade 
with the hopes of buying into a hot investment and selling your losers. Jumping 
onto a “winner” and dumping a “loser” may provide some short-term psycho-
logical comfort, but in the long term, such an investment strategy often produces 
subpar returns.
When a particular investment is all over the news and everyone is talking about its 
stunning rise, it’s definitely time to take a reality check. The higher the value of 
an investment rises, the greater the danger that it’s overpriced. Its next move may 
be downward.
During the late 1990s, for example, many technology and Internet stocks had 
spectacular rises, thus attracting a lot of attention. However, the fact that the U.S. 
economy is increasingly becoming technology-based doesn’t mean that any price 
you pay for a technology stock is fine. Some investors who neglected to do basic 
research and bought into the attention-grabbing, high-flying technology stocks 
lost 80 percent or more of their investments in subsequent years — ouch!
Conversely, when things look bleak (as when stocks in general suffered signifi-
cant losses in the early 2000s and then again in the late 2000s), giving up hope is 

154      PART 3  Investing for Your Future Goals
easy  — who wants to lose money? However, investors who forget about their 
overall asset allocation plan and panic and sell after a major decline miss out on a 
potential rebound in the market and a tremendous buying opportunity. We like 
buying televisions, computers, and cars on sale. Yet when the stock market is hav-
ing a sale, many investors panic and sell instead of looking for bargains. Have 
courage and don’t follow the herd.
Don’t let a poor string of events sour you on stock investing. History has repeat-
edly proven that continuing to buy stocks during down markets increases long-
term returns. Throwing in the towel is the worst thing you can do in a slumping 
market. And don’t waste time trying to find a way to beat the system. Buy and 
hold a diversified portfolio of stocks. The financial markets reward investors for 
accepting risk and uncertainty.
Selecting an Investment Firm
Thousands of firms sell investments and manage money. Banks, fund companies, 
securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, and others all want your money. 
I recommend that you do business with investment companies that
»
» Offer the best value investments in comparison to their competitors. 
Value is the combination of performance (including service) and cost. 
Commissions, management fees, maintenance fees, and other charges can 
turn a high-performance investment into a mediocre or poor one.
»
» Employ representatives who don’t have an inherent self-interest in 
steering you into a particular type of investment. Give preference to 
investing firms that don’t tempt their employees to push one investment over 
another in order to generate more fees. If the investment firm’s people are 
paid on commission, be careful.
Funds are an ideal investment vehicle for most investors. No-load fund companies 
are firms through which you can invest in funds without paying sales commis-
sions, so all your invested dollars go to work in the mutual funds you choose.
Discount brokers generally pay the salaries of their brokers. Discount brokers are 
simply brokers without major conflicts of interest. Of course, like any other for-
profit enterprise, they’re in business to make money, but they’re much less likely 
to steer you wrong for their own benefit.
In Chapter 12, I name names and recommend some of the best investments to 
utilize.

CHAPTER 10  Successful Investing Principles      155
Evaluating Pundits and Experts
Believing that you can increase your investment returns by following the prog-
nostications of certain gurus is a common mistake that some investors make, 
especially during more trying and uncertain times. Many people want to believe 
that some experts can predict the future of the investment world and keep them 
out of harm’s way.
During the financial crisis of 2008, all sorts of pundits were coming out of the 
woodwork, claiming that they had predicted what was unfolding. And when bad 
things were happening, commentators were all over the place predicting what 
would happen next.
The sad part about hyped articles with hyped predictions is that they cause some 
individual investors to panic and do the wrong thing, like selling good assets such 
as stocks at depressed prices. The media shouldn’t irresponsibly publicize hyped 
predictions, especially without clearly and accurately disclosing the predictor’s 
track record. Don’t fall victim to such hype.
Ignore the predictions and speculations of self-proclaimed gurus and investment 
soothsayers. Commentators and experts who publish predictive commentaries 
and newsletters and who are interviewed in the media can’t predict the future. 
The few people who have a slight leg up on everyone else aren’t going to share 
their investment secrets — they’re too busy investing their own money! If you 
have to believe in something to offset your fears, believe in good information and 
proven investment managers.
My website, www.erictyson.com, provides excerpts and updates from the best 
newsletters to which I subscribe and read. Also check out the “Guru Watch”

real records.

Making the Best Use 
of Bank Accounts
W
hile you were in school, you may have had a savings or checking account 
to help you save money and pay some bills. When you’re in the real 
world and out of school, you have to consider whether you want to 
make a longer-term commitment with a financial institution, such as a bank.
In this chapter, I walk you through your bank account choices and what investiga-
tive work you need to do to find the best bank for you. I also address some alterna-
tives to having a bank account in the first place.
Identifying Your Options
When figuring out where to protect your hard-earned money, you have several 
choices. You want to select an institution that offers the services you need on 
attractive terms. The following sections outline these choices and provide some 
helpful information.

158      PART 3  Investing for Your Future Goals
Brick-and-mortar banks
The most obvious choice for banking is using a local bank you pass by on a regular 
basis. Although these types of banks are conveniently located, these banks may 
not be the most cost efficient. You can find two main types of brick-and-mortar 
banks:
»
» Small-town bank: These banks only have a handful of branches. Some of the 
tellers may even remember your name and face. Hours are generally limited, 
and you may face extra ATM fees for using ATMs that aren’t at one of the 
bank’s branches.
A sometimes attractive, “small-town” banking option is credit unions. To join, 
you generally need to work for a particular employer (such as General Electric) 
or industry/occupation (for example, teachers). Thanks to a federal govern-
ment exemption on income taxes, credit unions tend to be able to pay higher 
interest rates on deposits and charge lower rates on loans. Don’t assume, 
however, that a local credit union always has the best deals; be sure to 
comparison shop. To locate credit unions near you, visit the Credit Union 
National Association website for consumers at www.asmarterchoice.org 
and click on the “Find a Credit Union” link or call them at 800-356-9655.
»
» Big banks: Such banks tend to be regional, national, and sometimes even 
multinational. You may recognize their name from extensive advertising 
campaigns. They tend to have extensive ATM networks, which may reduce your 
ATM fees, but you pay for it in other ways, such as through less-competitive 
terms (interest rate paid, service fees levied) on checking and savings accounts.
Later in this chapter, in the “Banking Online” section, I identify some universal 
questions you can ask when searching for a bank, no matter which kind of bank 
you use.
Be sure to comparison shop among several banks and scrutinize their fees and 
interest rates on their checking accounts and any other type of account you may 
be interested in. Also, read the “Understanding Your Bank Account Options” sec-
tion later in this chapter, and read the rest of the chapter so you’re aware of your 
nonbank and Internet banking options.
Online banks
Although traditional banks with walk-in branch locations are shrinking in num-
ber because of closures, consolidations, and some failures, online banking is 
growing — and for good reason. One of the biggest expenses of operating a tradi-
tional retail bank is the cost of the real estate and the related costs of the branch.

CHAPTER 11  Making the Best Use of Bank Accounts      159
Online banks generally don’t have any or many retail branches and conduct their 
business mostly over the Internet and through the mail. By lowering their costs of 
doing business, the best online banks may offer better account terms, such as 
paying you higher interest rates on your account balances. Online banks can also 
offer better terms on loans.
Online banking is convenient, too  — you can conduct most transactions more 
quickly on the Internet, and by banking online, you save the bank money, which 
enables the bank to offer you better account terms. And because online banking is 
generally available 24/7, you don’t need to rush out at lunchtime to make it to 
your bank during its limited open hours. (Note: Traditional brick-and-mortar 
banks now generally offer many online services.)
According to a recent customer ratings’ summary done by Consumer Reports, the 
highest-rated online banks are (in order, starting with the highest rated): USAA, 
Schwab Bank, Everbank, Discover Bank, Ally Bank, State Farm Bank, Capital One 
360, and E-Trade Bank.
Other choices
You can also place your money in a brokerage account or money market fund. If 
you want to consider other options that offer more attractive investment accounts 
and options, check out the later section “Considering Your Alternatives.”
Understanding Your Bank 
Account Options
No matter what type of bank you choose, make sure you have a firm grasp of the 
different account options. Doing so requires thinking about your banking needs 
and what’s important to you and what’s not. The following sections identify how 
you can protect your moolah with different accounts and access your money when 
you need it.
Transaction accounts
Whether it’s paying monthly bills or having something in your wallet to make 
purchases with at retail stores, everyone needs the ability to conduct transactions. 
Two of the most common types of transaction accounts are checking accounts and 
credit cards.

160      PART 3  Investing for Your Future Goals
Checking accounts
The most fundamental of bank accounts, a checking account enables you to pay bills 
(by check or electronic payments) and deposit money from your job (including 
through direct deposit). Interest paid is generally low or nonexistent, and you 
need to watch out for various fees.
During periods of low interest rates, the fees levied on a transaction account, such 
as a checking account, should be of greater concern to you than the interest paid 
on account balances. After all, you shouldn’t be keeping lots of extra cash in a 
checking account; you have better options for that. I discuss those options later in 
this chapter.
Debit cards are excellent transaction cards. They connect to your checking account, 
thus eliminating the need for you to carry around excess cash. They carry a Visa or 
MasterCard logo and are widely accepted by merchants for purchases and for 
obtaining cash from your checking account. Unlike a credit card, debit cards have 
no credit feature, so you can’t spend money that you don’t have.
Because of bank regulations, bank customers must give their permission/consent 
in advance for overdraft protection and the associated fee from a debit-card 
transaction. (Check and electronic bill payments go through as they always have 
and can lead to an account being overdrawn.)
However, you can rack up overdraft fees if your bank processes debit-card trans-
actions that lead to your account being overdrawn.
Credit cards
These transaction cards, which are offered by banks with either the Visa or 
­MasterCard logo, enable you to make purchases and pay for them over time if you 
so choose. (Discover and American Express also offer their own credit cards.)
I’m not a fan of credit cards because the credit feature enables you to spend money 
you don’t have and carry a debt balance from month to month. Notwithstanding 
the lower short-term interest rates some cards charge to lure new customers, the 
reality is that borrowing on credit cards is expensive — usually to the tune of 
about 16 percent. The smart way to use such a card is to pay the bill in full each 
month and avoid these high interest charges.
Options for getting cash
You need a firm understanding of the different features of the transaction accounts 
your bank offers so you can easily access your cash. You may think choosing a 
bank that has a large ATM network is your best option, but think again.

CHAPTER 11  Making the Best Use of Bank Accounts      161
One reason that bank customers have gotten lousy terms on their accounts is that 
they gravitate toward larger banks and their extensive ATM networks so they can 
easily get cash when they need it. These ATM networks (and the often-associated 
bank branches) are costly for banks to maintain. So, you pay higher fees and get 
lower yields when you’re the customer of a bank with a large ATM network — 
especially a bank that does tons of advertising.
Do you really need to carry a lot of cash and have access to a large ATM network? 
Probably not. A debit card is likely the better option for most people since these 
cards are so widely accepted by retailers and other product and service sellers.
Savings accounts
Savings accounts are accounts for holding spare cash in order to earn some interest. 
Banks and credit unions generally pay higher interest rates on savings account 
balances than they do on checking account balances. But savings account interest 
rates have often lagged behind the rates of the best money market funds offered 
by mutual fund companies and brokerage firms. Online banking is changing that 
dynamic, however, and now the best banks and credit unions offer competitive 
rates on savings accounts.
The virtue of most savings accounts is that you can earn some interest yet have 
penalty-free access to your money. The investment doesn’t fluctuate in value the 
way a bond does, and you don’t have early-withdrawal penalties as you do with a 
certificate of deposit (CD).
Banking Online
No matter whether you choose a brick-and-mortar bank or an online bank, tech-
nology has allowed people to do more and more of their banking on the Internet. 
With this benefit come some important points to remember to protect yourself 
and your dinero. In this section, I explain the best ways to evaluate an online bank 
and how to make the most of banking online.
Evaluating a bank: What to look for
When looking for a bank that fits your needs, put on your detective hat and get 
ready to search for the best deals. You don’t want to pick a bank just because that’s 
where your parents or a co-worker bank.

162      PART 3  Investing for Your Future Goals
So what do you look for? You first want to look for a bank that participates in the 
U.S. government–operated Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) pro-
gram. Otherwise, if the bank fails, your money isn’t protected. The FDIC covers 
your deposits at each bank up to a cool quarter million dollars.
Some online banks are able to offer higher interest rates because they’re based 
overseas and, therefore, don’t participate in the FDIC program. (Banks must pay 
insurance premiums into the FDIC fund, which, of course, adds to a bank’s costs.) 
Another risk for you is noncovered banks that take excessive risks with their busi-
ness to be able to pay depositors higher interest rates.
When considering doing business with an online bank or a smaller bank you 
haven’t heard of, you should be especially careful to ensure that the bank is cov-
ered under the FDIC. And don’t simply accept the bank’s word for it or the bank’s 
display of the FDIC logo in its offices or on its website.
Check the FDIC’s website database of FDIC-insured institutions to see whether 
the bank you’re considering doing business with is covered. Search by going to the 
FDIC’s “BankFind” page (research.fdic.gov/bankfind). You can search by the 
bank’s name, city, state, or zip code. For insured banks, you can see the date it 
became insured, its insurance certificate number, the main office location for the 
bank (and branches), its primary government regulator, and other links to detailed 
information about the bank. In the event that your bank doesn’t appear on the 
FDIC list yet the bank claims FDIC coverage, contact the FDIC at 877-275-3342.
In addition to ensuring that a bank is covered by the FDIC, also seek answers to 
these questions:
»
» What’s the bank’s reputation for its services? This may not be easy to 
discern, but at a minimum, you should conduct an Internet search of the 
bank’s name along with the word “complaints” or “problems” and examine 
the results.
»
» How accessible and knowledgeable are customer-service people at the 
bank? You want to be able to talk to a live, helpful person when you need 
help. Look for a phone number on the bank’s website and call it to see how 
difficult reaching a live person is. Ask the customer-service representatives 
questions to determine how knowledgeable and service oriented they are.
»
» What are the process and options for withdrawing your money? This 
issue is important to discuss with the bank’s customer-service people because 
you want convenient, low-cost access to your money. For example, if a bank 
lacks ATMs, what does it charge you for using other ATMs?

CHAPTER 11  Making the Best Use of Bank Accounts      163
»
» What are the fees for particular services? You can probably find this 
information on the bank’s website in a section called “accounts terms” or 
“disclosures.” Also, look for the Truth in Savings Disclosure, which answers 
relevant account questions in a standardized format. Figure 11-1 shows an 
example of a bank’s disclosure for its savings account.
Protecting yourself online
The attractions of banking online are pretty obvious. For starters, banking on your 
computer whenever you want can be enormously convenient. You don’t have to 
race around during your lunch break to find a local bank branch. And thanks to 
their lower overhead, the best online banks are generally able to offer competitive 
interest rates and account terms to their customers. Even if you go with a brick- 
and-mortar bank, you can usually also bank online.

164      PART 3  Investing for Your Future Goals
You probably know from experience that conducting any type of transaction 
online is safe as long as you use some common sense and know who you’re doing 
business with before you go forward. That said, others who’ve gone before you 
have gotten ripped off, so you do need to protect yourself.
Folks have been taken online to the tune of more than one billion dollars a year, 
according to the Internet Crime Complaint Center (ICCC), which is a joint govern-
ment effort between the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National White 
Collar Crime Center.
ICCC and other online security experts recommend that you take the following 
steps to protect yourself and your identity when conducting business online:
»
» Never access your bank accounts from a shared computer or on a shared 
network, such as the free access networks offered in hotel rooms and in other 
public or business facilities.
»
» Make certain that your computer has antivirus and firewall software that’s 
periodically updated to keep up with the latest threats.
»
» Be aware of missed statements that could indicate your account has been 
taken over.
»
» Report unauthorized transactions to your bank or credit-card company as soon 
as possible; otherwise, your bank may not stand behind the loss of funds.
»
» Use a complicated and unique password (including both letters and numbers) 
for your online bank account.
»
» Be careful about the sites you visit. Sites purporting to offer free-access music, 
games, and movies are often sources of viruses and trojans that fraudsters 
use to steal your account information.
»
» Watch out for phishers, people posing to be your bank or bank’s representa-
tive. If “they” are contacting you, especially through email, it’s likely to be fraud. 
Never follow a bank link directly from an email; always visit the bank website 
directly by typing in the URL.
»
» Log out immediately after completing your transactions on financial websites.
Considering Your Alternatives
Other financial companies have cost advantages similar to — and in some cases 
even better than — those of banks, which translates into better deals for you. This 
section addresses two alternatives to bank accounts you may want to consider.

CHAPTER 11  Making the Best Use of Bank Accounts      165
Brokerage accounts with check writing
Brokerage firms enable you to buy and sell stocks, bonds, and other securities. 
Charles Schwab, Scottrade, E*Trade, TD Ameritrade, and Fidelity are among the 
larger brokerage firms or investment companies with substantial brokerage oper-
ations you may have read or heard about. (See Chapter 12 for my specific recom-
mendations of firms that I like.)
Some of these firms have fairly extensive branch office networks and others don’t. 
But those that have a reasonable number of branch offices have been able to keep 
a competitive position because of their extensive customer and asset base and 
because they aren’t burdened by banking regulations (because they aren’t banks) 
and the costs associated with operating as a bank.
A type of account worth checking out at brokerage firms is an asset management 
account, also referred to as a cash management account. Although the best deals on 
such accounts at some firms are only available to higher-balance investors, the 
best of these accounts typically enable you to
»
» Hold and invest in various investments (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and so 
on) in a single account
»
» Write checks against a money market balance that pays competitive yields
»
» Use a Visa or MasterCard debit card for transactions
Money market funds
Basically, a money market fund is very similar to a bank savings account except that 
mutual fund companies offer them, which means they lack FDIC coverage. His-
torically, this hasn’t been a problem, because retail money funds have lost share-
holder principal only in one case (the Reserve Primary fund lost less than 1 percent 
of investors’ money).
The attraction of money market funds is that the best ones pay higher yields than 
bank savings accounts and also come in tax-free versions, which is good for 
higher-tax-bracket investors. I explain money market funds in greater detail in 
Chapter 12.

n Chapter 10, I discuss the principles of intelligent investing. This chapter takes 
you a step further to help you match your investments to specific goals.
Before You Begin Investing
Before you cast your investment line, consider the following two often-overlooked 
ways to put your money to work and earn higher returns without much risk:
»
» Pay off high-interest debt. If, for example, you have credit-card debt 
outstanding at 14 percent interest, paying off that loan is the same as putting 
your money to work in an investment with a sure 14 percent annual return. 
Remember that the interest on consumer debt isn’t tax-deductible, so you 
would actually need to earn more than 14 percent investing your money 
elsewhere in order to net 14 percent after paying taxes.
»
» Fund retirement accounts. If you work for a company that offers a retire-
ment savings plan such as a 401(k), fund it at the highest level you can 
manage. If you earn self-employment income, consider an SEP-IRA plan. 
(I discuss the tax benefits of funding retirement plans in Chapter 6.) Keep 
money for shorter-term goals, like buying a car or a home, in separate, much 
more liquid accounts.

168      PART 3  Investing for Your Future Goals
Investing Nonretirement Account Money
When you invest money outside a retirement account, those investments are 
exposed to taxation. Therefore, you must understand the tax features of your situ-
ation and your investment choices.
To decide between comparable taxable and tax-free investments, you need to 
know your marginal tax bracket (the tax rate you pay on an extra dollar of taxable 
income) and each investment’s interest rate or yield. (See Chapter 6 to understand 
your tax bracket.)
In the sections that follow, I give specific advice about investing your money while 
keeping an eye on taxes.
Emergency money
When you have a few thousand dollars or less, your simplest path is to keep this 
money in a local bank or credit union. Look first to the institution where you keep 
your checking account. Keeping this stash of money in your checking account, 
rather than in a separate savings account, makes financial sense if the extra 
money helps you avoid monthly service charges when your checking account bal-
ance would otherwise dip below the minimum. Compare the service charges on 
your checking account with the potential interest earnings from a savings account.
Another option to consider is putting your money into a money market fund, a type 
of mutual fund, the best of which are usually superior to bank savings accounts 
because they pay higher yields than bank savings accounts and allow check-writing. 
And if you’re in a high tax bracket, you can select a tax-free money market fund, 
which pays interest that’s free from federal and/or state tax — something you can’t 
get with a bank savings account.
The yield on a money market fund is an important consideration. The operating 
expenses deducted before payment of dividends are generally the single biggest 
determinant of yield. All other things being equal, lower operating expenses 
translate into higher yields for you. With interest rates as low as they have been in 
recent years, seeking out money funds with the lowest operating expenses is 
essential.
Doing most or all of your fund shopping (money market and otherwise) at one 
good fund company can reduce the clutter in your investing life. Chasing after a 
slightly higher yield offered by another company is sometimes not worth the extra 

CHAPTER 12  Portfolios for a Purpose      169
paperwork and administrative hassle. On the other hand, there’s no reason why 
you can’t invest in funds at multiple firms (as long as you don’t mind the extra 
accounts), using each for its relative strengths. (You can buy funds from different 
fund companies in a single brokerage account — I explain how in the “Discount 
brokers” section later in this chapter.)
Most fund companies don’t have many local branch offices, so you may have to 
open and maintain your money market mutual fund through the fund’s toll-free 
phone line, website, or the mail. Distance has its advantages. Because you can 
conduct business by mail, the Internet, and the phone, you don’t need to go 
schlepping into a local branch office to make deposits and withdrawals. I’m happy 
to report that I haven’t visited a bank office in many years.
Despite the distance between you and your fund company, your money is still 
accessible via check-writing, and you can also have money transferred electroni-
cally to your local bank on any business day. Increasing numbers of investment 
companies are offering you the ability to deposit checks now through a smart-
phone app. Also, if you need to mail in some checks to deposit, don’t fret about a 
deposit being lost in the mail; it rarely happens, and no one can legally cash a 
check made payable to you, anyway. Always endorse checks with the notation “for 
deposit only” under your signature.
Long-term money
If you plan to invest outside retirement accounts, asset allocation for these 
accounts should depend on how comfortable you are with risk and how much time 
you have until you plan to use the money. That’s not because you won’t be able to 
sell these investments on short notice if necessary. Investing money in a more 
volatile investment is simply riskier if you need to liquidate it in the short term.
For example, suppose you’re saving money for a down payment to buy a house in 
one to two years. If you had put this money into the U.S. stock market near the 
beginning of one of the stock market’s major downturns (such as what happened 
in 2000 and then again in 2007), you’d have been mighty unhappy. You would 
have seen a substantial portion of your money and home-buying dreams vanish 
in the following year or two.
In the sections that follow, I walk you through common investments for longer-
term purposes.

170      PART 3  Investing for Your Future Goals
Defining your time horizons
I organize the different investment options in the remainder of this section by 
time frame and by your tax situation. Following are summaries of the different 
time frames associated with each type of fund:
»
» Short-term investments: These investments are suitable for saving money 
for a home or some other major purchase within a few years. When investing 
for the short term, look for liquidity and stability — features that rule out real 
estate and stocks. Recommended investments include shorter-term bond 
funds, which are higher-yielding alternatives to money market funds. If 
interest rates increase, these funds will likely drop in value, but relatively less 
than longer-term bond funds. I also discuss Treasury bonds and certificates of 
deposit (CDs) later in this section.
»
» Intermediate-term investments: These investments are appropriate for 
more than a few years but less than ten years. Investments that fill the bill are 
intermediate-term bonds and well-diversified balanced funds (which include 
some stocks as well as bonds).
»
» Long-term investments: If you have a decade or more for investing your 
money, you can consider a portfolio that’s balanced between bonds and 
potentially higher-return (and therefore riskier) investments. Stocks, real 
estate, and other growth-oriented investments can earn the most money if 
you’re comfortable with the risk involved.
Buying Treasuries direct
Like a few other countries, the U.S. Treasury offers inflation-indexed government 
bonds. Because a portion of these Treasury bonds’ return is pegged to the rate of 
inflation, the bonds offer investors a safer type of Treasury bond investment 
option. This portion of your return is reflected as an inflation adjustment to the 
principal you invested. The other portion of your return is paid out in interest. 
Thus, an inflation-indexed Treasury bond investor would not see the purchasing 
power of his investment eroded by unexpected inflation.
Inflation-indexed Treasuries can be a good investment for conservative bond 
investors who are worried about inflation, as well as taxpayers who want to hold 
the government accountable for increases in inflation. The downside: Inflation-
indexed bonds can yield slightly lower returns, because they’re less risky com-
pared to regular Treasury bonds.
If you want a low-cost method of investing in Treasury bonds, you can purchase 
Treasuries directly from the Federal Reserve Bank. To open an account through 
the Treasury Direct program, visit their website at www.treasurydirect.gov.

CHAPTER 12  Portfolios for a Purpose      171
You do sacrifice a bit of liquidity, however, when purchasing Treasury bonds directly 
from the government. In order to sell a bond bought through Treasury Direct, you 
have to have it transferred to a bank, broker, or dealer, which takes some time and 
hassle. And, you will surely incur a fee/commission to sell the bond through the 
bank, broker, or dealer. If you want daily access to your money, buy a recommended 
Vanguard Treasury fund and pay the company’s low management fee.
Purchasing certificates of deposit (CDs)
Bank CDs are popular with generally older, safety-minded investors with some 
extra cash that they don’t need in the near future (typically a year or two). With a 
CD, you get a higher rate of return than you get on a bank savings account. And 
unlike with bond and stock funds, your principal doesn’t fluctuate in value.
Compared to bonds, however, CDs have a couple of drawbacks:
»
» Inaccessibility: In a CD, your money isn’t accessible unless you pay a 
penalty — typically six months’ interest. With a no-load (commission-free) 
bond fund, you can access your money without penalty whenever you need it.
»
» Taxability: Interest from CDs is taxable. Bonds, on the other hand, come in 
tax-free (federal and/or state) and taxable flavors. So bonds offer higher-tax- 
bracket investors a tax-friendly option that CDs can’t match.
In the long run, you should earn more — perhaps 1 to 2 percent more per year — 
and have better access to your money in bond funds than in CDs. Bond funds make 
particular sense when you’re in a higher tax bracket and you’d benefit from tax-free 
income on your investments (by investing in municipal bond funds). If you’re not in 
a high tax bracket and you have a bad day whenever your bond fund takes a dip in 
value, consider CDs. Just make sure you shop around to get the best interest rate.
Investing in stocks and stock funds
Stocks have stood the test of time for building wealth. (In Chapter 10, I discuss 
picking individual stocks versus investing through stock mutual funds.) Remem-
ber that when you invest in stocks in taxable (nonretirement) accounts, all the 
distributions on those stocks, such as dividends and capital gains, are taxable. 
Stock dividends and long-term capital gains do benefit from lower tax rates 
(maximum of 23.8 percent, but this may decrease under future possible Congres-
sional action).
Some stock-picking advocates argue that you should shun stock funds because of 
tax considerations. I disagree. You can avoid stock funds that generate a lot of 
short-term capital gains, which are taxed at the relatively high ordinary income 
tax rates. Index funds, which invest in a fixed mix of stocks to track a particular 

172      PART 3  Investing for Your Future Goals
market index, are tax-efficient. Additionally, some fund companies offer tax-
friendly stock funds, which are appropriate if you don’t want current income or 
you’re in a high federal tax bracket and seek to minimize receiving taxable distri-
butions on your funds.
Vanguard (800-662-7447; www.vanguard.com) offers the best menu of tax-
managed stock funds. Alternatively, you can invest in a wider variety of diversified 
stock funds inside an annuity (see the following section).
Checking out annuities
Annuities are accounts that are partly insurance but mostly investment. Consider 
contributing to an annuity only after you exhaust contributions to all your avail-
able retirement accounts. Because annuities carry higher annual operating 
expenses than comparable mutual funds, you should consider them only if you 
plan to leave your money invested, preferably for 15 years or more. Even if you 
leave your money invested for that long, tax-friendly funds can allow your money 
to grow without excessive annual taxation.
The best annuities can be purchased from no-load (commission-free) mutual 
fund companies  — specifically Vanguard (800-662-7447; www.vanguard.com), 
Fidelity (800-544-4702; www.fidelity.com), and T. Rowe Price (800-638-5660; 
www.troweprice.com).
Investing Retirement Account Money
If you’re in your young-adult years, the good news is that you likely have decades 
to grow your nest egg before you need to draw on the bulk of your retirement 
account assets. The more years you have before you’re going to retire, the greater 
your ability to take risk. As long as the value of your investments has time to 
recover, what’s the big deal if some of your investments drop a bit over a year or 
two? Of course, you should be concerned with growing your portfolio enough to 
keep you ahead of the inevitable inflation that occurs over the years.
Think of your retirement accounts as part of your overall plan to generate retire-
ment income. Then allocate different types of investments between your tax-
advantaged retirement accounts and other taxable investment accounts to get the 
maximum benefit of tax deferral. This section helps you determine how to dis-
tribute your money in retirement plans.

CHAPTER 12  Portfolios for a Purpose      173
Establishing and prioritizing  
retirement contributions
When you have access to various retirement accounts, prioritize which account 
you’re going to use first by determining how much each gives you in return. You 
should focus your contributions in this order:
1.	 First fund employer-based plans that match your contributions.
2.	 Next, contribute to any other employer or self-employed plans that allow 
tax-deductible contributions.
3.	 After you contribute as much as possible to these tax-deductible plans 
(or if you don’t have access to such plans), contribute to an IRA.
4.	 If you max out on contributions to an IRA or exceed the income limita-
tions for an IRA contribution, consider a Roth 401(k) (employer-offered, 
after-tax contributions) and then an annuity.
Investments and account types are different issues. People sometimes get confused 
when discussing the investments they make in retirement accounts — especially 
people who have a retirement account, such as an IRA, at a bank. They don’t realize 
that you can have your IRA at a variety of financial institutions (for example, a 
mutual fund company or brokerage firm). At each financial institution, you can 
choose among the firm’s investment options for investing your IRA money.
No-load, or commission-free, mutual fund and discount brokerage firms are your 
best bets for establishing a retirement account (see Chapter 10 for more informa-
tion on these accounts).
Allocating money in employer plans
In some company-sponsored plans, such as 401(k)s, you’re limited to a short list 
of investment choices. I discuss typical investment options for 401(k) plans in 
order of increasing risk and, hence, likely return:
»
» Money market: Folks who are skittish about the stock and bond markets are 
attracted to money market and savings accounts because they haven’t 
dropped in value. In the long run, you won’t be doing yourself any favors. 
Trying to time your investments to attempt to catch the lows and avoid the 
peaks isn’t possible (see Chapter 10).
»
» Bond mutual funds: Bond funds invest in a mixture of typically high-quality 
bonds. Bonds pay a higher yield than money funds. Depending on whether 
your plan’s option is a short-term, intermediate-term, or long-term fund 
(maybe you have more than one type), the bond fund’s current yield is 

174      PART 3  Investing for Your Future Goals
probably a percent or two higher than the money market fund’s yield. Bond 
funds carry higher yields than money market funds, but they also carry 
greater risk, because their value can fall if interest rates increase. However, 
bonds tend to be more stable in value over the shorter term (such as a few 
years) than stocks. Aggressive, younger investors should keep a minimum 
amount of money in bond funds (see the asset allocation discussion in 
Chapter 10).
»
» Guaranteed-investment contracts (GICs), also known as stable value 
funds: Guaranteed-investment contracts are backed by an insurance 
company, and they typically quote you an interest rate a year in advance. The 
attraction of these investments is that your account value doesn’t fluctuate (at 
least, not that you can see). In GICs, you pay for the peace of mind of a 
guaranteed return with lower than bond fund long-term returns. And GICs 
have another minor drawback: Insurance companies, unlike mutual funds, 
can and do fail, putting GIC investment dollars at risk. Some retirement plans 
have been burned by insurer failures.
»
» Balanced mutual funds: Balanced funds invest primarily in a mixture of 
stocks and bonds. This one-stop-shopping concept offers broad diversifica-
tion, makes investing easier, and smoothes out fluctuations in the value of 
your investments. Funds investing exclusively in stocks or in bonds make for a 
rougher ride.
»
» Stock funds: Stock funds invest in stocks, which often provide greater 
long-term growth potential but also wider fluctuations in value from year to 
year. Some companies offer a number of different stock funds, including 
funds that invest overseas. Unless you plan to borrow against your funds to 
purchase a home (if your plan allows), you should have plenty of stock funds.
»
» Stock in your employer: Some companies offer employees the option of 
investing in the company’s stock. I generally suggest avoiding this option 
because your future income and other employee benefits are already riding 
on the company’s success. If the company hits the skids, you may lose your 
job and your benefits. You certainly don’t want the value of your retirement 
account to depend on the same factors. If you think strongly that your 
company has its act together and the stock is a good buy, investing a portion 
of your retirement account is fine — but no more than 25 percent. Some 
employers offer employees an option to buy company stock outside a 
tax-deferred retirement plan at a discount, sometimes as much as 15 percent, 
to its current market value. If your company offers a discount on its stock, 
consider taking advantage of it. When you sell the stock, you’re usually able to 
lock in a profit over your purchase price.
Table 12-1 shows a couple of examples of how people in different employer plans 
may choose to allocate their 401(k) investments among the plan’s investment 
options. See Chapter 10 for more background on asset allocation decisions.

CHAPTER 12  Portfolios for a Purpose      175
Designating money in plans you design
With self-employed plans (for example, SEP-IRAs), certain 403(b) plans for non-
profit employees, and IRAs, you may select the investment options as well as the 
allocation of money among them. In the sections that follow, I give some specific 
mixes that you may find useful for investing at some of the premier investment 
companies.
To establish your retirement account at one of these firms, call the company’s 
toll-free number, and ask the representative to send you an account application 
for the type of account (for example, SEP-IRA, 403(b), and so on) you want to set 
up. Most investment firms provide downloadable account applications, and they 
may allow you to complete the application online.
Vanguard: No-load leader
Vanguard (800-662-7447; www.vanguard.com) is a mutual fund powerhouse and 
also operates a discount brokerage division. It’s the largest no-load fund company 
and consistently has the lowest overall operating expenses in the business. His-
torically, Vanguard’s funds have excellent performance when compared to those 
of its peers, especially among conservatively managed bond and stock funds.
For an aggressive portfolio (80 percent stocks, 20 percent bonds), try this:
»
» Vanguard Star (fund of funds) — 50 percent
»
» Vanguard Total Stock Market Index — 30 percent
»
» Vanguard Total International Stock Index — 20 percent
Or you can place 100 percent in Vanguard LifeStrategy Growth, which is a fund of 
four different Vanguard funds and thus highly diversified.

Fidelity: Investment behemoth
Fidelity Investments (800-544-8888; www.fidelity.com) is the largest provider 
of mutual funds in terms of total assets, and it operates a discount brokerage divi-
sion. However, some Fidelity funds assess sales charges (no such funds are rec-
ommended in the sections that follow).
For an aggressive portfolio (80 percent stocks, 20 percent bonds), try this:
»
» Fidelity Puritan (balanced fund) — 35 percent
»
» Dodge & Cox Stock and/or Harbor Capital Appreciation — 25 percent
»
» Fidelity Low-Priced Stock — 20 percent
»
» Vanguard Total International Stock Index and/or Litman Gregory Masters’ 
International — 20 percent
Discount brokers
A discount brokerage account can allow you centralized, one-stop shopping and the 
ability to hold mutual funds from a variety of leading fund companies. Some funds 
are available without transaction fees, although you pay a small transaction fee to 
buy most of the better funds. The reason: The discounter is a middleman between 
you and the fund companies.
You have to weigh the convenience of being able to buy and hold funds from mul-
tiple fund companies in a single account versus the lower cost of buying funds 
directly from their providers. A $25 to $30 transaction fee can gobble a sizable 
chunk of what you have to invest, especially if you’re investing smaller amounts.
Among brokerage firms or brokerage divisions of mutual fund companies, for 
breadth of fund offerings and competitive pricing, I like E*Trade (800-387-2331; 
us.etrade.com), T. Rowe Price (800-225-5132; www.troweprice.com), and Van-
guard (800-992-8327; www.vanguard.com).

Investing for Education
Whether you’re about to begin a regular college investment plan or you’ve already 
started saving, your emotions may lead you astray. The hype about educational 
costs may scare you into taking a financially detrimental path. Quality education 
for your children (or continued education for yourself) doesn’t have to, and prob-
ably won’t, cost you as much as gargantuan projections suggest. In this section, I 
explain the inner workings of the financial aid system, help you gauge how much 
money you’ll need, and discuss educational investment options.
Understanding the importance 
of applying for financial aid
Just as your child shouldn’t choose a college based solely on whether he thinks he 
can get in, he shouldn’t choose a college on the basis of whether you think you can 
afford it. Except for the affluent, who can pay for the full cost of college, everyone 
else should apply for financial aid. Some parents who don’t think they qualify for 
financial aid are pleasantly surprised to find that their children have access to 
loans as well as grants (which don’t have to be repaid).
Completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is the first step 
in the financial aid process. (See the form online at www.fafsa.ed.gov.) Some 
private colleges also require completing the Financial Aid Form (FAF), which asks 
for more information than the FAFSA. Some schools also supplement the FAFSA 
with PROFILE forms; these forms are mainly used by costly private schools to dif-
ferentiate need among financial aid applicants. States have their own financial aid 
programs, so apply to these programs as well if your child plans to attend an in-
state college.
The data you supply through student aid forms is run through a financial needs 
analysis, a standard methodology approved by the U.S. Congress. The analysis cal-
culates how much money you, as the parent(s), and your child, as the student, are 
expected to contribute toward educational expenses. Even if the needs analysis 
determines that you don’t qualify for needs-based financial aid, you may still have 
access to loans that are not based on need. So be sure you apply for financial aid.
Using your retirement accounts
Under the current financial needs analysis, the value of your retirement plans 
isn’t considered an asset. By contrast, money that you save outside retirement 
accounts, especially money in the child’s name, is counted as an asset and reduces 
your eligibility for financial aid.

178      PART 3  Investing for Your Future Goals
Fund your retirement accounts, such as 401(k)s and SEP-IRAs, before saving for 
your child’s education. In addition to getting an immediate tax deduction on your 
contributions, your earnings grow without taxation while you’re maximizing your 
child’s chances of qualifying for aid. Forgoing contributions to your retirement 
savings plans to save in a taxable account for your kid’s college fund is foolish 
because you’ll be expected to contribute more to your child’s educational costs.
Putting money in kids’ names
Save money in your name rather than in your children’s names if you plan to 
apply for financial aid. Colleges expect a much greater percentage of the money in 
your children’s names to be used for college costs than the money in your name.
However, if you’re affluent enough to foot your child’s college bill without outside 
help, investing in your kid’s name can save you money in taxes. Prior to your 
child’s reaching age 18, the first $1,050 for 2017 of interest and dividend income 
is tax-free; the next $1,050 is taxed at 10 percent. Any income above $2,100 is 
taxed at the parents’ marginal tax rate. Upon reaching age 19 (or age 24 if your 
offspring are still full-time students), income generated by investments in your 
child’s name is taxed at your child’s presumably lower tax rate. Parents control a 
custodial account until the child reaches either the age of 18 or 21, depending on 
the state in which you reside.
FINANCIAL AID REALLY ISN’T AID AT ALL 
BUT A PRICING SYSTEM
Now, I must point out that “financial aid” isn’t really aid at all. What typically happens at 
most colleges and universities is that some of the families are expected to pay the full 
charges, many are expected to pay a good portion of the full price, and some don’t pay 
anything at all. So, even though a given private school may charge say $65,000 per year, 
their average “customer” may actually pay something closer to $35,000 per year.
Which, logically, raises the question as to why the college doesn’t simply charge every-
one $35,000 per year and do away with the cumbersome, invasive, and often unfair 
financial aid process. Under the current system, the customers of college are first asked 
to provide personal financial information so the schools can assess how much they can 
afford to pay. That way the schools can collect more from those who have more and 
that money effectively helps pay the way for those who are deemed able to pay less 
than average.
Is this a fair system? Some people don’t think so. Is there a better way to do this? 
Perhaps. For now, this is the system that colleges and universities generally use.

CHAPTER 12  Portfolios for a Purpose      179
Tapping into Coverdell Education  
Savings Accounts
Coverdell Education Savings Accounts (ESAs) are another option that, like a tradi-
tional custodial account, makes sense for affluent parents who don’t expect to 
apply for or need any type of financial aid. As with regular custodial accounts, 
parents who have their kids apply for financial aid will be penalized by college 
financial aid offices for having ESA balances.
Subject to eligibility requirements, you can put up to $2,000 per child per year into 
an ESA. Single taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes (AGIs) of $110,000 or more 
and couples with AGIs of $220,000 or more may not contribute to an ESA (although 
another individual, such as a grandparent, may make the contribution to the 
child’s account). Although the contribution isn’t tax-deductible, future invest-
ment earnings compound without taxation. Upon withdrawal, the investment 
earnings aren’t taxed as long as the money is used for qualified education 
expenses.
Using 529 college savings plans
Section 529 plans are named after Internal Revenue Code Section 529 and also 
known as qualified state tuition plans. A parent or grandparent can generally put 
more than $200,000 per beneficiary into one of these plans.
The attraction of the Section 529 plans is that money inside the plans compounds 
without tax, and if it’s used to pay for college tuition, room and board, and other 
related higher-education expenses, the investment earnings and appreciation 
can be withdrawn tax-free. In addition to paying college costs, the money in 
­Section 529 plans may also be used for graduate school expenses. Some states 
provide additional tax benefits on contributions to their state-sanctioned plan.
You can generally invest in any state plan to pay college expenses in any state, 
regardless of where you live.
A big potential drawback of the Section 529 plans — especially for families hoping 
for some financial aid — is that college financial aid offices treat assets in these 
plans as parental nonretirement assets. Even worse, the assets can be considered 
as belonging to an older child when an independent young adult no longer reports 
parental financial information for financial aid purposes.
Please also be aware that a future Congress could change the tax laws affecting 
these plans, diminishing the tax breaks or increasing the penalties for nonquali-
fied withdrawals.

180      PART 3  Investing for Your Future Goals
529 plans make sense for affluent parents (or grandparents) to establish for chil-
dren who don’t expect to qualify for financial aid. Do your research and homework 
before investing in any plan. Check out the investment track record and fees in 
each plan, as well as restrictions on transferring to other plans or changing ben-
eficiaries. See my website (www.erictyson.com) for more information on these 
plans.
Weighing home equity
Your family’s assets may also include equity in real estate and businesses that you 
own. Although the federal financial aid analysis no longer counts equity in your 
primary residence as an asset, many private (independent) schools continue to 
ask parents for this information when making their own financial aid determina-
tions. Therefore, paying down your home mortgage more quickly instead of fund-
ing retirement accounts can harm you financially: You may end up with less 
financial aid and a higher tax bill.
Paying for educational costs
Although you may not have children yet or your children may be young, you’ve 
probably started thinking about how you’re going to pay for their college expenses. 
College can cost a lot. The total costs, including tuition, fees, books, supplies, 
room, board, and transportation, vary substantially from school to school. The 
total average annual cost is running around $50,000 per year at private colleges 
and around $25,000 (in-state rate) at public colleges. Figuring out how you’re 
going to pay these expenses can be overwhelming.
You first want to put as much money as possible in your retirement accounts. If 
you have money left over after taking advantage of retirement accounts, try to 
save for your children’s college costs. Save in your name unless you know you 
aren’t going to apply for financial aid, including those loans that are available 
regardless of your economic situation.
Be realistic about what you can afford for college expenses given your other finan-
cial goals. Being able to personally pay 100 percent of the cost of a college educa-
tion, especially at a four-year private college, is a luxury of the affluent. If you’re 
not a high-income earner, consider trying to save enough to pay a third or, at 
most, half of the cost. You can make up the balance through a wide variety of 
means, such as the following:
»
» Loans: A host of financial aid programs, including a number of loan programs, 
allow you to borrow at reasonable interest rates. Federal government 
educational loans have variable interest rates, which means that the interest 

CHAPTER 12  Portfolios for a Purpose      181
rate you’re charged floats, or varies, with the overall level of interest rates. The 
rates are also capped so the rate can never exceed several percent more than 
the initial rate on the loan.
A number of loan programs, such as unsubsidized Stafford Loans and Parent 
Loans for Undergraduate Students (PLUS), are available even when your 
family is not deemed financially needy. Only subsidized Stafford Loans, on 
which the federal government pays the interest that accumulates while the 
student is still in school, are limited to students deemed financially needy. For 
more information about these loan programs, call the Federal Student Aid 
Information Center at 800-433-3243 or visit its website at www.studentaid.
ed.gov.
»
» Grants: In addition to loans, a number of grant programs are available 
through schools, the government, and independent sources. You can apply 
for federal government grants via the FAFSA. Grants available through state 
government programs may require a separate application. Specific colleges 
and other private organizations (for example, employers, banks, credit unions, 
and community groups) also offer grants and scholarships.
»
» Your home’s equity: If you’re a homeowner, you may be able to borrow 
against the equity (market value less the outstanding mortgage loan) in your 
property. This option is useful because you can borrow against your home at 
a reasonable interest rate, and the interest is generally tax-deductible. Some 
company retirement plans, such as 401(k)s, allow borrowing as well.
»
» IRAs: Parents may make penalty-free withdrawals from individual retirement 
accounts if the funds are used for college expenses. Although you won’t be 
charged an early-withdrawal penalty, the IRS (and most states) will treat 
the amount withdrawn as taxable income. On top of that, the financial aid 
office will look at your beefed-up income and assume that you don’t need as 
much financial aid. (You can make qualified withdrawals from Roth IRAs and 
not be taxed.)
»
» Your child’s employment: Your child can work during the summer and save 
that money for educational expenses. Besides giving your child a stake in his 
own future, this training encourages sound personal financial management.

Real-Estate Investing
I
f you’ve already bought your own home (and even if you haven’t), using real 
estate as an investment may interest you. Over the decades and generations, 
real-estate investing, like the stock market and small-business investments, 
has generated tremendous wealth for participants. (See Chapter 10 for more on 
the rate of return from various investments.)
Real estate is like other types of ownership investments, such as stocks, where 
you have an ownership stake in an asset. Although you have the potential for sig-
nificant profits, don’t forget that you also accept greater risk. Real estate isn’t a 
gravy train or a simple way to get wealthy. Like stocks, real estate goes through 
good and bad performance periods. Most people who make money investing in 
real estate do so because they invest and hold property over many years. The vast 
majority of people who don’t make money in real estate don’t because they make 
easily avoidable mistakes. In this chapter, I discuss how to make successful real-
estate investments and minimize your chances for mistakes.
Understanding Real-Estate Investment 
Pros and Cons
Many people build their wealth by investing in real estate. Real estate, like all 
investments, has its pros and cons.

184      PART 3  Investing for Your Future Goals
Some people focus exclusively on property investments, but many others build 
their wealth through the companies they started or through other avenues and 
then diversify into real-estate investments. What do these wealthy folks know, 
and why do they choose to invest in real estate? Here are real estate’s main 
attractions:
»
» Limited land: The supply of buildable, desirable land is generally limited. And 
because the population in desired areas grows over the years, demand for 
land and housing continues to grow. Land and what you can do with it are 
what make real estate valuable.
»
» Leverage: Real estate is different from most other investments because you 
can borrow 75 to 80 percent (or more) of the value of the property to buy it. 
Thus, you can use your down payment of 20 to 25 percent of the purchase 
price to buy, own, and control a much larger investment; this concept is called 
leverage. For example, suppose you purchase a rental property for $200,000 
and make a $40,000 down payment (and borrow the other $160,000). Over 
the next five years, the property appreciates to $240,000. Thus, your invest-
ment has appreciated $40,000 in value on an investment of just $40,000. 
Thus, you’ve made a 100 percent return on your investment.
»
» Ongoing income: In addition to appreciation potential, you also hope and 
expect to make money from renting the investment property to make a profit 
based on the property’s rental income in excess of its expenses (mortgage, 
property taxes, insurance, maintenance, and so on). Unless you make a large 
down payment, your monthly operating profit is usually small (or nonexistent) 
in the early years of rental property ownership. Over time, your operating 
profit, which is subject to ordinary income tax, should rise as you increase 
your rental prices faster than your expenses. During soft periods in the local 
economy, however, rents may rise more slowly than your expenses (or rents 
may even fall).
»
» Tax-deferred growth: With investment property, the appreciation of your 
properties compounds without tax during your years of ownership. You don’t 
pay tax on this profit until you sell your property, and even then you can roll 
over your gain into another investment property to avoid paying tax. (If you 
choose to simply take your profits and not roll them over, the federal tax rate 
on gains from property held more than one year — known as long-term capital 
gains — is no more than 23.8 percent.) When you sell a stock or fund invest-
ment that you hold outside a retirement account, you must pay tax on your 
profits. By contrast, if you roll over your real-estate gain into another like-kind 
investment real-estate property, you can avoid paying tax on your rental 
property profit when you sell. The rules for properly making one of these (IRS 
code section) 1031 exchanges (also known as Starker exchanges) are complex. 
Make sure you find an attorney or tax advisor who’s an expert at these 
transactions to ensure that everything goes smoothly (and legally).

CHAPTER 13  Real-Estate Investing      185
»
» Ability to add value: You, as a small investor, can’t add value to stocks by 
“fixing them up,” but you may have some good ideas about how to improve a 
property and make it more valuable. Perhaps you can fix up a property or 
develop it further and raise the rental income and resale value accordingly. 
Through legwork, persistence, and good negotiating skills, you may also be 
able to make money by purchasing a property below its fair market value. 
Relative to investing in the stock market, tenacious and savvy real-estate 
investors can more easily buy property below its fair market value. You can do 
the same in the stock market, but the legions of professional, full-time money 
managers who analyze stocks make finding bargains more difficult.
»
» Longer-term focus: One problem with investing in the securities markets, 
such as the stock market, is that prices are constantly changing. Cable TV 
channels, websites, smartphones, and other communication devices con-
stantly report the latest prices. From my observations and work with individ-
ual investors, I’ve seen that the constant reports cause some investors to lose 
sight of the long term and the big picture. Because all you need to do is tap 
your smartphone app, click your computer mouse, or dial a toll-free phone 
number to place your sell or buy order, some stock market investors fall prey 
to snap judgments. While the real-estate market is constantly changing, 
short-term, day-to-day, and week-to-week changes are invisible. Publications 
don’t report the value of your real-estate holdings daily, weekly, or even 
monthly, which is good for encouraging a longer-term focus. (Exception: Some 
real-estate price-tracking websites purport to have monthly and even weekly 
price updates on your property.) If prices do decline over months and years, 
you’re much less likely to sell in a panic with real estate. Preparing a property 
for sale and eventually getting it sold take a good deal of time, and this barrier 
to quickly selling helps keep your vision in focus.
Real-estate investing isn’t for everyone. Most people do better financially when 
they invest their ownership holdings in a diversified portfolio of stocks, such as 
through stock funds. Definitely shy away from real-estate investments that 
involve managing property if you fall into either of the following categories:
»
» You’re time-starved and anxious. Buying and owning investment property 
and being a landlord take a lot of time. If you fail to do your homework before 
purchasing real estate, you can end up overpaying or buying a heap of 
trouble. You can hire a property manager to help with screening and finding 
good tenants and troubleshooting problems with the building you purchase, 
but this step costs money and still requires some time involvement. Also, 
remember that most tenants don’t care for a property the same way property 
owners do. If every little scratch or carpet stain sends your blood pressure 
skyward, avoid distressing yourself as a landlord.

186      PART 3  Investing for Your Future Goals
»
» You’re not interested in real estate. Some people simply don’t feel comfort-
able and informed when it comes to investing in real estate. If you’ve had 
experience and success with other investments, such as stocks, stick with 
them and avoid real estate. Over long periods of time, both stocks and real 
estate provide comparable returns.
Investing in real estate is time-intensive, and it carries risks. Invest in real estate 
because you enjoy the challenge and because you want to diversify your portfolio. 
Real estate’s value doesn’t move in lockstep with other investments, such as stocks 
or small-business investments that you hold, so it’s a useful diversification tool.
Evaluating Simpler Real-Estate 
Investments
Investing in rental real estate that you’re responsible for can be a lot of work. 
Think about it this way: With rental properties, you have all the headaches of 
maintaining a property, including finding and dealing with tenants, without the 
benefits of living in and enjoying the property.
Unless you’re extraordinarily interested in and motivated to own investment real 
estate, begin with these simpler yet still profitable methods:
»
» Investing at home. For the long term, because you need a place to live, why 
not own real estate instead of renting it? Real estate is the only investment 
that you can live in or rent to produce income — you can’t live in a stock, 
bond, or mutual fund! Unless you expect to move within the next few years or 
live in an area where owning costs much more than renting, buying a place 
probably makes good long-term financial sense. In the long term, owning 
usually costs less than renting, and it allows you to build equity in an asset. 
See Chapter 7 to find out more about profiting from homeownership.
»
» Convert your home into a rental when you move. If you plan to move and 
want to keep your current home as a long-term investment property, you can. 
Be aware of the potential tax downsides of doing so. You owe tax on the profit 
if your property is a rental when you sell it and you don’t buy another rental 
property. You can purchase another rental property through a 1031 exchange 
to defer paying taxes on your profit.
»
» Evaluate real-estate investment trusts. Real-estate investment trusts (REITs) 
are entities that generally invest in different types of property, such as 
shopping centers, apartments, and other rental buildings. For a fee, REIT 

CHAPTER 13  Real-Estate Investing      187
managers identify and negotiate the purchase of properties that they believe 
are good investments, and then they manage these properties, including all 
tenant relations. Thus, REITs are a good way to invest in real estate if you don’t 
want the hassles and headaches that come with directly owning and manag-
ing rental property. You can research and purchase shares in individual REITs, 
which trade as securities on the major stock exchanges. An even better 
approach is to buy a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund that invests in a 
diversified mixture of REITs. In addition to providing you with a diversified, 
low-hassle real-estate investment, REITs offer an additional advantage that 
traditional rental real estate doesn’t: You can easily invest in REITs through a 
retirement account (for example, an IRA).
Assessing Residential Housing 
Investments
A solid bet for real-estate investing is to purchase residential property. People 
always need places to live. Residential housing is easier to understand, purchase, 
and manage than most other types of property, such as office and retail property. 
If you’re a homeowner, you already have experience locating, purchasing, and 
maintaining residential property.
The most common residential housing options are single-family homes, condo-
miniums, and townhouses. You can also purchase multi-unit buildings. In addi-
tion to the considerations that I address in Chapter 7, from an investment and 
rental perspective, consider the following issues when you decide what type of 
property to buy:
»
» Tenants: Single-family homes with just one tenant (which could be a family, a 
couple, or a single person) are simpler to deal with than a multi-unit apart-
ment building that requires the management of multiple renters and mainte-
nance of multiple units.
»
» Maintenance: From the property owner’s perspective, condominiums are 
generally the lowest-maintenance properties because most condo associa-
tions deal with issues such as roofing, gardening, and so on for the entire 
building. Note that as the owner, you’re still responsible for maintenance 
that’s needed inside your unit, such as servicing appliances, interior painting, 
and so on. Beware, though, that some condo complexes don’t allow rentals. 
With a single-family home or apartment building, you’re responsible for all the 
maintenance. Of course, you can hire someone to do the work, but you still 

188      PART 3  Investing for Your Future Goals
have to find the contractors and coordinate, oversee, and pay for the work 
they do.
»
» Appreciation potential: Look for property where simple cosmetic and other 
fixes may allow you to increase rents and increase the market value of the 
property. Although condos may be easier on the unit owner to maintain, they 
tend to appreciate less than homes or apartment buildings, unless the condos 
are located in a desirable urban area.
»
» Cash flow: The difference between the rental income you collect and the 
expenses you pay out is known as your cash flow. With all properties, as time 
goes on, generating a positive cash flow gets easier as you pay down your 
mortgage debt and (hopefully) increase your rents. Unless you can afford a 
large down payment of 25 percent or more (to help pay down your debt), the 
early years of rental-property ownership may financially challenge you. Making 
a profit in the early years from the monthly cash flow of a single-family home 
may be hard because some properties sell at a premium price relative to the 
rent that they can command. Remember, you pay extra for the land, which you 
generally can’t rent. Also, the downside to having just one tenant is that when 
you have a vacancy, you have no rental income. Apartment buildings, particu-
larly those with more units, can generally produce a small positive cash flow, 
even in the early years of rental ownership.
Unless you really want to minimize maintenance responsibilities, avoid condo-
minium investments. Similarly, apartment-building investments are best left to 
sophisticated investors who like a challenge and can manage more-complex 
properties. Single-family home investments are generally more straightforward 
for most people. Run the numbers on your rental income and expenses to see 
whether you can afford the negative cash flow that often occurs in the early years 
of ownership (I show you how in the “Estimating cash flow” section later in this 
chapter). And do thorough inspections before you buy any property that will be 
used as a rental.
Investing in Commercial Real Estate
Ever thought about owning and renting out a small office building or strip mall? 
If you’re really motivated and willing to roll up your sleeves, you may want to 
consider commercial real-estate investments. However, you’re generally better 
off not investing in such real estate because it’s much more complicated than 
investing in residential real estate. It’s also riskier from an investment and 
tenant-turnover perspective. When tenants move out, new tenants sometimes 
require extensive and costly improvements.

CHAPTER 13  Real-Estate Investing      189
If you’re a knowledgeable real-estate investor and you like a challenge, here are 
two good times to invest in commercial real estate:
»
» When your analysis of the local market suggests that it’s a good time to buy
»
» When you can use some of the space to run your own small business
Just as owning your home is generally more cost-effective than renting over the 
years, so it is with commercial real estate if — and this is a big if — you buy at a 
reasonably good time and hold the property for many years.
So how do you evaluate the state of your local commercial real-estate market? 
Examine the supply-and-demand statistics over recent years. Determine how 
much space is available for rent and how that number has changed over time. Also 
discover the vacancy rate, and find out how it has changed in recent years. Finally, 
investigate the rental rates, usually quoted as a price per square foot. See the sec-
tion “Researching Where and What to Buy” later in this chapter to find out how to 
gather this kind of information.
Here’s one sign that purchasing a commercial property in a particular area is not 
wise: The supply of available space in the market has increased faster than 
demand, leading to falling rental rates and higher vacancies. A slowing local 
economy and an increasing unemployment rate also spell trouble for commercial 
real-estate prices. Each market is different, so make sure you check out the details 
of your area.
Shunning Sure-to-Lose Real-Estate 
Investments
While I discuss time-tested real-estate investments, I would be remiss if I also 
didn’t highlight real-estate investments you should avoid due to their terrible

» Time shares: Time shares are near-certain money losers. With a time share, 
you buy a week or two of ownership or usage of a particular unit, usually a 
condominium, in a resort location. If you pay, for example, $10,000 for a week 
of “ownership,” you would pay the equivalent of about $520,000 a year for the 
whole unit. However, a comparable unit nearby may sell for only $175,000. 
The extra markup pays the salespeople’s commissions, administrative 
expenses, and profits for the time-share development company. (This little 

190      PART 3  Investing for Your Future Goals
analysis also ignores the not-so-inconsequential ongoing time-share mainte-
nance fees.) Vacationers are easy prey for salespeople who, often using 
high-pressure sales tactics and the lure of a free stay in a unit for a night or 
two, want to sell them a souvenir of the trip. Why commit yourself to taking a 
vacation to the same places at the same time each year? Many time shares let 
you trade your weeks; however, doing so is a hassle, and you’re limited by 
what time slots you can trade for, which are typically dates that other people 
don’t want.
»
» Second (vacation) homes: Some folks dream of having a weekend cottage or 
condo — a place they can retreat to when crowded urban or suburban living 
conditions get on their nerves. Most second-home owners I know rent out 
their property very little — 10 percent or less of the time. As a result, second 
homes are usually money drains. I’ve seen more than a few cases in which the 
second home is such a cash drain that it prevents its owners from contribut-
ing to and taking advantage of tax-deductible retirement savings plans. If you 
don’t rent out a second home most of the time, ask yourself whether you can 
afford such a luxury. Can you accomplish your other financial goals (for 
example, saving for retirement, paying for the home in which you live) with 
this added expense? Keeping a second home is more of a consumption than 
an investment decision.
»
» Limited partnerships: High sales commissions and ongoing management 
fees burden limited partnerships (LPs) sold through stockbrokers and 
financial planners who work on commission. Quality real-estate investment 
trusts (REITs), which I discuss earlier in this chapter, are far better investments. 
REITs, unlike LPs, are also highly liquid.
»
» High-priced real-estate seminars: Beware the pitches and promises of 
hucksters selling grossly overpriced seminars and the like that purport to 
teach you the simple secrets to getting rich. I’ve seen the pitches too many 
times (often with real estate and stock investing) and warned about them 
often over the decades. Trump University lured in its victims by employing a 
time-tested method: selling basic information at an exorbitant price tag. With 
Trump University, it began with a supposed “free seminar” and then escalated 
quickly to more ($1,495) and more ($34,995) costly seminars that ended up 
providing the “students” with unremarkable information that failed to make 
them rich. Cable television infomercials and websites bring investors a 
never-ending stream of real-estate hucksters. The faces and names change 
over the years, but the pitch is the same. If you’re a cable television viewer, 
you’ve likely seen some of the chirpy and lengthy real-estate infomercials on 
cable television channels. Quite often, you will find pitched books, audio 
tapes, and DVDs that are filled with excessive motivational nonsense wherein 
the guru preaches about the importance of having the right mind-set and 
attitude to succeed as a real-estate investor. He provides little in the way of 
details and how-to information. It turns out that there’s a good reason for this 

CHAPTER 13  Real-Estate Investing      191
lack of information. After customers buy a book or DVD set directly from his 
company, his salespeople use high-pressure tactics to sell personal real-estate 
coaching services for thousands of dollars.
If a real-estate investment “opportunity” sounds too good to be true, it is. If you 
want to invest in real estate, avoid the hucksters and scams and instead invest 
directly in properties that you can control or invest through reputable REITs (or 
REIT mutual funds), which I discuss earlier in this chapter.
Researching Where and What to Buy
If you’re going to invest in real estate, spend some time and energy to do some 
research regarding where and what to buy. I’m not suggesting that you need to 
conduct a nationwide search for the best areas. In fact, investing in real estate 
“closer to home” is best because you’re probably more familiar with the area, 
allowing you to have an easier time researching and managing the properties. 
This section discusses the important research to do.
Considering economic issues
People need places to live, but an area doesn’t generally attract homebuyers if jobs 
don’t exist there. Ideally, look to invest in real estate in communities that main-
tain diverse job bases. If the local economy relies heavily on jobs in a small num-
ber of industries, that dependence increases the potential risk of your real-estate 
investments. If one of those industries falls on hard times, people may move 
away, leaving a glut of housing behind. That doesn’t bode well for a rental prop-
erty in that area. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics compiles this type of data for 
metropolitan areas and counties. Visit www.bls.gov for more information.
Also, consider an area’s likelihood of appreciation or depreciation. Determine 
which industries are more heavily represented in the local economy. If most of the 
jobs come from slow-growing or shrinking employment sectors, real-estate 
prices are unlikely to rise quickly in the years ahead. On the other hand, areas with 
a greater preponderance of high-growth industries stand a greater chance of 
faster price appreciation.
Finally, check out the unemployment situation and examine how the jobless rate 
has changed in recent years. Good signs to look for are declining unemployment 
and increasing job growth. The Bureau of Labor Statistics also tracks this data.

192      PART 3  Investing for Your Future Goals
Taking a look at the real-estate market
The price of real estate, like the price of anything else, is driven by supply and 
demand. The smaller the supply and the greater the demand, the higher prices 
usually climb. An abundance of land and available credit, however, inevitably lead 
to overbuilding. When the supply of anything expands at a much faster rate than 
demand, prices generally fall.
Upward pressure on real-estate prices tends to be greatest in areas with little 
buildable land. In the long term, the lack of buildable land in an area can be a 
problem. Real-estate prices that are too high may cause employers and employees 
to relocate to less-expensive areas. If you want to invest in real estate in an area 
with little buildable land and sky-high prices, run the numbers to see whether the 
deal makes economic sense. (I explain how to do this later in this chapter.)
In addition to buildable land, consider these other important real-estate market 
indicators to get a sense of the health, or lack thereof, of a particular market:
»
» Building permits: The trend in the number of building permits tells you how 
the supply of real-estate properties may soon change. A long and sustained 
rise in permits over several years can indicate that the supply of new property 
may dampen future price appreciation.
»
» Vacancy rates: If few rentals are vacant, you can assume that the area has 
more competition and demand for existing units, which bodes well for future 
real-estate price appreciation. Conversely, high vacancy rates indicate an 
excess supply of real estate, which may put downward pressure on rents as 
landlords compete to attract tenants.
»
» Listings of property for sale and number of sales: Just as the construction 
of many new buildings is bad for future real-estate price appreciation, 
increasing numbers of property listings may indicate potential future trouble. 
As property prices reach high levels, some investors decide that they can 
make more money cashing in and investing elsewhere. When the market is 
flooded with listings, prospective buyers can be choosier, exerting downward 
pressure on prices. At high prices (relative to the cost of renting), more 
prospective buyers elect to rent, and the number of sales relative to listings 
drops. A sign of a healthy real-estate market is a decreasing and relatively low 
level of property listings, indicating that the demand from buyers meets or 
exceeds the supply of property for sale from sellers. When the cost of buying 
is relatively low compared with the cost of renting, more renters can afford 
and choose to purchase, thus increasing the number of sales.
»
» Rents: The trend in rental rates that renters are willing and able to pay over 
the years gives a good indication of the demand for housing. When the 
demand for housing keeps up with the supply of housing and the local 

CHAPTER 13  Real-Estate Investing      193
economy continues to grow, rents generally increase. This increase is a 
positive sign for continued real-estate price appreciation. Beware of buying 
rental property subject to rent control; the property’s expenses may rise faster 
than you can raise the rents.
Examining property valuation  
and financial projections
How do you know what a property is really worth? Some say it’s worth what a 
ready, willing, and financially able buyer is willing to pay. But some buyers pay 
more than what a property is truly worth. And sometimes buyers who are patient, 
do their homework, and negotiate well are able to buy property for less than its 
fair market value.
Crunching some numbers to figure what revenue and expenses a rental property 
may have is one of the most important exercises that you can go through when 
determining a property’s worth and making an offer. In the sections that follow, 
I walk you through these important calculations.
Estimating cash flow
Cash flow is the money that a property brings in minus what goes out for its 
expenses. If you pay so much for a property that its expenses (including the mort-
gage payment and property taxes) consistently exceed its income, you have a 
money drain on your hands. Maybe you have the financial reserves to withstand 
the temporary drain for the first few years, but you need to know upfront what 
you’re getting yourself into.
Here are two big mistakes that novice rental-property investors make:
»
» They fail to realize all the costs associated with investment property. In 
the worst cases, some investors end up in personal bankruptcy from the drain 
of negative cash flow (expenses exceeding income). In other cases, negative 
cash flow hampers investors’ ability to accomplish important financial goals.
»
» They believe the financial statements that sellers and their real-estate 
agents prepare. Just as an employer views a résumé with some skepticism, 
you should always view such financial statements as advertisements rather 
than sources of objective information. In some cases, sellers and agents fib or 
spin things in the most favorable way. In most cases, these statements 
contain lots of projections and best-case scenarios.

194      PART 3  Investing for Your Future Goals
For property that you’re considering purchasing, ask for a copy of Schedule E 
(Supplemental Income and Losses) from the property seller’s federal income tax 
return. When most people complete their tax returns, in order to minimize their 
income taxes, they try to minimize their revenue and maximize their expenses — 
the opposite of what they and their agents normally do on the statements they 
sometimes compile to hype the property sale. Confidentiality and privacy aren’t 
an issue when you ask for Schedule E because you’re asking only for this one 
schedule and not the person’s entire income tax return.
You should prepare financial statements based on facts and a realistic assessment 
of a property. Take your time, and make the decision with your eyes and ears open 
and with a healthy degree of skepticism.
Valuing property
Estimating a property’s cash flow is an important first step to figuring a proper-
ty’s value. But on its own, a building’s cash flow doesn’t provide enough informa-
tion to intelligently decide whether to buy a particular real-estate investment. 
Just because a property has a positive cash flow doesn’t mean you should buy it. 
In areas where investors expect to earn lower rates of appreciation, real estate 
generally sells for less and may have better cash flow.
Just as you should evaluate a stock versus other comparable stocks, so, too, should 
you compare the asking price of a property with the prices of comparable real 
estate. But what if all real estate is overvalued? Such a comparison doesn’t reveal 
the state of inflated prices. So in addition to comparing a real-estate investment 
property to comparable properties, you need to perform some local area evalua-
tions of whether prices from a historic perspective appear too high, too low, or 
just right.
Here are the pros and cons of the different approaches you can use to value 
property:
»
» Appraisers: The biggest advantage of hiring an appraiser is that she values 
property for a living. An appraisal also gives you some hard numbers to use 
for negotiating with a seller. Hire a full-time appraiser who has experience 
valuing the type of property you’re considering. Ask her for examples of a 
dozen similar properties in the area that she has appraised in the past 
three months.
The drawback of appraisers is that they cost money. A small home may cost 
several hundred dollars to appraise, and a larger multi-unit building may cost 
$1,000 or more. The danger is that you can spend money on an appraisal for 
a building that you don’t end up buying.

CHAPTER 13  Real-Estate Investing      195
»
» Real-estate agents: If you work with a good real-estate agent, ask him to 
draw up a list of comparable properties and help you estimate the value of 
the property you’re considering buying. The advantage of having your agent 
help with this analysis is that you don’t pay extra for this service.
The drawback of asking an agent what to pay for a property is that his 
commission depends on your buying a property and on the amount you pay 
for that property. The more you’re willing to pay for a property, the more likely 
the deal is completed, and the more the agent makes on commission.
»
» Do-it-yourself: If you’re comfortable with numbers and analysis, you can try 
to estimate the value of a property yourself. The hard part is identifying 
comparable properties. Finding identical properties is usually impossible, so 
you need to find similar properties and then make adjustments to their selling 
prices so you can do an apples-to-apples comparison.
Among the factors that should influence your analysis of comparable 
properties are the date each property sold; the quality of the location; the lot 
size; the building age and condition; the number of units; the number of 
rooms, bedrooms, and bathrooms; the number of garages and fireplaces; and 
the size of the yard. A real-estate agent can provide this information, or you 
can track it down for properties you’ve seen or you know have recently sold.
Through a series of price adjustments, you can then compare the value of 
your target property to others that have recently sold. For example, if a similar 
property sold six months ago for $250,000 but prices overall have decreased 
3 percent in the last six months, subtract 3 percent from the sales price. 
Ultimately, you have to attach a value or price to each difference between 
comparable properties and the one you’re considering buying.
Digging for a Good Deal
Everyone likes to get a deal or feel like they bought something at a relatively low 
price. How else can you explain the American retail practice of sales? Merchandise 
is first overpriced, and what doesn’t sell quickly enough is then marked down to 
create the illusion that you’re getting a bargain! Some real-estate sellers and 
agents do the same thing. They list property for sale at an inflated price and then 
mark it down after they realize no one will pay their asking price. “A $30,000 price 
reduction!” the new listing screams. Of course, such reductions are rarely a deal.
It’s possible to get a good buy on a problem property that provides a discount 
larger than the cost of fixing the property. However, these opportunities are hard 
to find, and sellers of such properties are often unwilling to sell at a discount 
that’s big enough to leave you much room for profit. If you don’t know how to 

196      PART 3  Investing for Your Future Goals
thoroughly and correctly evaluate the property’s problems, you can end up 
overpaying.
Scores of books claim to have the real-estate investment strategy that can beat the 
system. Often these promoters claim you can become a multimillionaire through 
investing in distressed properties. A common suggested strategy is to purchase 
property that a seller has defaulted on or is about to default on. Or how about buy-
ing a property in someone’s estate through probate court? Maybe you’d like to try 
your hand at investing in a property that has been condemned or has toxic-waste 
contamination!
In some cases, the strategies that these real-estate gurus advocate involve taking 
advantage of people’s lack of knowledge. For example, some people don’t know 
that they can protect the equity in their home by filing for personal bankruptcy. If 
you can find a seller in such dire financial straits and desperate for cash, you may 
get a bargain buy on the home. (You may struggle with the moral issues of buying 
property cheaply this way, however.)
Other methods of finding discounted property take lots of time and digging. Some 
involve cold-calling property owners to see whether they’re interested in selling. 
This method is a little bit like trying to fill a job opening by interviewing people 
you run into on a street corner. Although you may eventually find a good candi-
date this way, if you factor in the value of your time, the deal seems like less of a 
bargain.
Without making things complicated or too risky, you can use some of the follow-
ing time-tested and proven ways to buy real estate at a discount to its fair market 
value: 
»
» Find a motivated seller. Be patient and look at lots of properties, and sooner 
or later you’ll come across one that someone needs to sell (and these aren’t 
necessarily the ones advertised as having motivated sellers). Perhaps the 
seller has bought another property and needs the money to close on the 
recent purchase. Having access to sufficient financing can help secure 
such deals.
»
» Buy unwanted properties with fixable flaws. The easiest problems to 
correct are cosmetic. Some sellers and their agents are lazy and don’t even 
bother to clean a property. One single-family home that I bought had 
probably three years’ worth of cobwebs and dust accumulated. It seemed 
like a dungeon at night because half the light bulbs were burned out.
Painting; tearing up old, ugly carpeting; refinishing hardwood floors; and 
putting new plantings in a yard are relatively easy jobs. They make the 
property worth more and make renters willing to pay higher rent. Of course, 

CHAPTER 13  Real-Estate Investing      197
these tasks take money and time, and many buyers aren’t interested in 
dealing with problems. If you have an eye for improving property and are 
willing to invest the time that coordinating the fix-up work requires, go for it! 
Just make sure you hire someone to conduct a thorough property inspection 
before you buy.
Be sure to factor in the loss of rental income if you can’t fully rent the property 
during the fix-up period. Some investors have gone belly up from the double 
cash drain of fix-up expenses and lost rents.
»
» Buy when the real-estate market is depressed. When the economy takes a 
few knocks and investors rush for the exits (as in the downturn before, during, 
and after the 2008 financial crisis), it’s time to go shopping! Buy real estate 
when prices and investor interest are down. Interest rates are usually lower 
then too. During times of depressed markets, obtaining properties that 
produce a positive cash flow (even in the early years) is easier.
»
» Check for zoning opportunities. Sometimes you can make more productive 
use of a property. For example, you can legally convert some multi-unit 
apartment buildings into condominiums. Some single-family residences may 
include a rental unit if local zoning allows for it. A good real-estate agent, 
contractor, and the local planning office in the town or city where you’re 
looking at property can help you identify properties that you can convert. 
However, if you’re not a proponent of development, you probably won’t like 
this strategy.
If you buy good real estate and hold it for the long term, you can earn a healthy 
return from your investment. Over the long haul, having bought a property at a 
discount becomes an insignificant issue. You make money from your real-estate 
investments as the market appreciates and as a result of your ability to manage 
your property well. So don’t obsess over buying property at a discount and don’t 
wait for the perfect deal, because it won’t always come along.

The Lowdown on 
Health Insurance
W
hen you’re young and living under your parents’ roof, you’re unlikely 
to be concerned with health insurance. School-aged kids generally get 
their health insurance through a parent’s coverage, a practice that’s 
usually continued through college.
Welcome to the young-adult world of health insurance! Health insurance was in 
the news soon after the election of President Barack Obama in 2008 because he 
promised during the campaign, and then pushed for, a national health insurance 
program mandated by the federal government.
Health insurance was front and center once again during the 2016 Presidential 
election. Candidate Donald Trump promised over and over again that he would 
“repeal and replace” Obamacare with “something so much better.” Once elected, 
President Trump soon discovered that the U.S. healthcare and health insurance 
industries are much more complicated than he realized, as is getting members of 
Congress to agree on a specific repeal-and-replace plan. “Now, I have to tell you, 
it’s an unbelievably complex subject  .  .  .  Nobody knew healthcare could be so 
­complicated,” President Trump said in his second month in office.

202      PART 4  Insurance: Protect Yourself, Your Loved Ones, and Your Assets
I could have told Mr. Trump that the healthcare industry and reforming it is 
complicated  — but he didn’t ask me! In fact, I’ve had involvement with and 
interest in the healthcare and insurance industry since my first professional job 
after college as a management consultant. Most young adults are fortunate to not 
be big consumers of healthcare. But, because you never know what the future 
holds, and people of all ages should get checkups and preventative care, this 
chapter discusses the best and most affordable ways to secure health insurance in 
your 20s and 30s. I also cover the ramifications of the healthcare bill that was 
signed into law in 2010 and what may be coming in the Trump administration.
Making Sure You’re Covered
Having health insurance is essential for nearly everyone, no matter your age. 
Many people get health insurance through their employers. Unfortunately, plenty 
of people don’t have coverage. In fact, studies estimate that about one in five folks 
in their 20s lack health insurance coverage.
Historically, some people who can afford health insurance choose not to buy it 
because they believe they’re healthy and they’re not going to need it. Others who 
opt not to buy health insurance figure that if they ever really need healthcare, 
they’ll get it even if they can’t fully afford it.
Although you may think you’re healthy and don’t need health insurance, think 
again. People without health insurance are more prone to put off getting routine 
and preventative care, which can lead to small problems turning into big ones. 
Besides this being an unwise approach to optimizing your health, it often costs 
more because of advanced illness, emergency room visits, and so on.
This section discusses transitioning from your parents’ coverage to your own and 
how the healthcare laws help you get coverage.
Transitioning your coverage
Each state once had its own laws as far as health insurance coverage went, so 
there was no one-size-fits-all approach. In the past in most states, an adult child 
generally lost health insurance coverage under a parent’s policy upon college 
graduation or when turning a particular age (for example, 25 or 26). Each state 
had a unique set of laws. Consider, for example, three state rules I pulled at 
random:

CHAPTER 14  The Lowdown on Health Insurance      203
»
» Connecticut required that group comprehensive and health insurance policies 
extend coverage to unwed children until the age of 26, provided they remained 
residents of Connecticut or were full-time students.
»
» Florida allowed for dependent children up to age 25 who lived with a parent 
or were students, and those up to 30 who were also unmarried and had no 
dependent children of their own, to remain on their parents’ insurance.
»
» Wyoming allowed a child who was unmarried and a full-time student to 
remain on a parent’s insurance up to age 23 if the parent was covered by a 
small group policy.
What a headache! And, then the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, 
was passed in 2010 so states had to amend their approach to conform with Obam-
acare’s requirements — detailed in the next section. (At the time this book goes to 
press in late 2017, it is unclear what, if any, changes may be coming out of the new 
Congress and President.)
So what are the best ways to negotiate keeping health insurance coverage in your 
20s without spending a small fortune for coverage? Here’s my advice:
»
» Consider staying on your parents’ policy until you secure full-time 
employment. As soon as you’re eligible for your employer’s health plan, sign 
up for it.
»
» If you don’t have access to your own coverage through your employer, 
look to COBRA. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) 
enables you to stay on your parents’ policy for up to 18 months from the time 
you lose coverage on that policy. Just be aware that you have to pay the full 
premiums.
»
» If you’re self-employed, or your employer doesn’t offer health coverage, 
or the coverage isn’t very good, get your own policy with a high deduct-
ible. A deductible is the amount of medical claims you must first pay out of 
your pocket before insurance coverage kicks in. Check out the later section 
“Finding Your Best Health Plan” for advice. You can then sock money away in a 
health savings account (HSA) if you desire. See the section on HSAs later in 
this chapter.
Seeing how the 2010 healthcare laws 
(Obamacare) changed your coverage
In 2010, Congress passed, and President Obama signed, two comprehensive 
healthcare reform bills that affect how you can get health insurance coverage. 

204      PART 4  Insurance: Protect Yourself, Your Loved Ones, and Your Assets
Summarizing thousands of pages of legislation in a concise space is challenging, 
but the reality is that the highlights that apply to young adults aren’t that 
extensive.
Obamacare implemented the following changes to group health plans offered 
through employers:
»
» They must offer coverage to their employees for their adult children up to age 
26 who aren’t eligible for coverage under another employer’s health plan. 
So if your mother or father is covered under a group health plan, you may get 
coverage through that plan through age 26, even if you aren’t a dependent for 
income tax purposes. The coverage isn’t taxable to the employee or dependent.
»
» They may not impose lifetime limits on claims paid (annual limits became 
prohibited as of 2014).
»
» Employers must offer minimum coverage to full-time employees or make 
payments to the government.
»
» Group health plans must limit cost sharing and deductibles to those in a 
health savings account–eligible, high-deductible health plan.
»
» Group health plans must remove all preexisting-condition exclusions on all 
participants.
Higher-income earners are subjected to some higher taxes to help pay for the 
health bill:
»
» Single taxpayers with earned income above $200,000 and married couples filing 
jointly with earned income above $250,000 pay an extra 0.9 percent Medicare tax 
on wages and self-employment income in excess of these thresholds.
»
» Taxpayers with modified adjusted income (MAGI) from any source (including 
investments) above these thresholds are subject to a 3.8 percent tax on the 
lesser of their net investment income (for example, interest, dividends, and 
capital gains) and the amount by which their modified adjusted gross income 
exceeds the thresholds.
Trumpcare?
At the time that this book went to press in late 2017, the new Congress and Presi-
dent Trump had been working to repeal and replace Obamacare but hadn’t made 
any progress. A more probable outcome could be modifying Obamacare rather 
than repealing and replacing it, but only time will tell.

Finding Your Best Health Plan
Most working-age folks obtain health insurance through their employer. 
Employer-provided coverage eliminates the hassle of having to shop for coverage 
from scratch. Also, thanks to the purchasing power of a group, employer-provided 
coverage may provide a higher level of benefits, given the cost, than individually 
purchased coverage.
If you’re self-employed, out of work, or working for an employer that doesn’t 
offer health coverage, you need to shop for and secure health insurance. And even 
if your employer does offer health policies, you may well have choices to make. In 
the following sections, I discuss the important issues to consider when selecting 
among available health insurance plans.
Selection of doctors and hospitals
Open-choice plans that allow you to use any doctor or hospital you want are less 
common and generally more expensive than restricted-choice plans, such as health 
maintenance organizations (HMOs) and preferred provider organizations (PPOs). 
These plans keep costs down because they negotiate low rates with selected 
providers.
HMOs and PPOs are more similar than they are different. The main difference is 
that PPOs still pay the majority of your expenses if you use a provider outside their 
approved list. If you use a provider outside the approved list with an HMO, you 
typically aren’t covered at all.
If you want to use particular doctors or hospitals, find out which health insurance 
plans they accept as payment. Weigh whether the extra cost of an open-choice 
plan is worth being able to use the services of particular medical providers if 
they’re not part of a restricted-choice plan. Also be aware that some plans allow 
you to go outside their network of providers as long as you pay a bigger portion of 
the incurred medical costs. If you’re interested in using alternative types of pro-
viders, such as acupuncturists, find out whether the plans you’re considering 
cover these services.
Plan benefits and features
Healthcare plans typically offer many bells and whistles. The following identifies 
the key features to search for to ensure a quality plan at the most reasonable cost:
»
» Major medical coverage: This includes hospital care, physician visits, and 
ancillary charges, such as X-rays and laboratory work. If you’re a woman and

you think you may want to have children, make sure your plan has mater-
nity benefits.
»
» Deductibles and co-payments: To reduce your health insurance premiums, 
choose a plan with the highest deductible and co-payment (the amount you pay 
when service is rendered, such as $10 to $30) you can afford. As with other 
insurance policies, the more you’re willing to share in the cost of your claims, 
the less you’ll have to pay in premiums. Most policies have annual deductible 
options (usually $250, $500, $1,000, or higher) as well as co-payment options, 
which are typically 20 percent or so of the claim amount. With the passage of 
Obamacare and plans compatible with health savings accounts, many plans 
have a deductible of several thousand dollars. Insurance plans generally set a 
maximum out-of-pocket limit such as $1,000 or $2,000 on your annual 
co-payments. The insurer covers 100 percent of any medical expenses that go 
over that cap. Many HMO plans don’t have deductible and co-payment options.
If you have existing health problems and you have a choice of group plans 
through your employer, consider plans with low out-of-pocket expenses. 
Because you’re part of a group, the insurer won’t increase your individual 
rates just because you file more claims.
»
» Lifetime maximum benefits: Health insurance plans specify the maximum 
total benefits they’ll pay over the course of time you’re insured by their plan. 
The national health insurance bill signed into law in 2010 prevents insurers 
from setting lifetime maximums. Should Obamacare be modified or repealed, 
keep in mind that with the high cost of healthcare, you should choose a plan 
that has no maximum or that has a maximum of at least $5 million. See the 
section “Seeing how the 2010 healthcare laws (Obamacare) changed your 
coverage ” earlier in this chapter.
Shopping for Health Insurance
Yes, health insurance is among the more complicated things to shop for, but it’s 
like other products and services — there’s a marketplace of providers competing 
for your business. This section explains how to unearth your best options and 
what to do in case you’re ever denied coverage in the future.
Uncovering the best policies
When shopping for health insurance, you basically have two options: You can buy 
a health plan through an agent or you can buy directly from an insurer. When 

CHAPTER 14  The Lowdown on Health Insurance      207
particular health insurance plans are sold both ways, buying through an agent 
usually doesn’t cost more.
Obamacare provided a new way in some states to buy health insurance — through 
state-based exchanges. Whether these continue depends on what Congress and 
President Trump can agree to. As of the publication of this book in late 2017, most 
state-based exchanges continue to operate.
If you’re self-employed or you work for a smaller employer that doesn’t offer 
health insurance as a benefit, get proposals from the larger and older health 
insurers in your area. Larger plans can negotiate better rates from providers, and 
older plans are more likely to be here tomorrow. Nationally, Blue Cross Blue 
Shield, Kaiser Permanente, Aetna, UnitedHealth, CIGNA, Assurant, and Anthem 
are among the older and bigger health insurers.
Many insurers operate in a bunch of different insurance businesses. You want an 
insurer that’s one of the biggest in the health insurance arena and is committed 
to, understands, and has more experience in that business. If your coverage is 
canceled, you may have to search for new coverage if the law continues nationally 
that mandates coverage for folks with an existing medical problem.
Before the passage of Obamacare, which included requiring coverage for everyone 
with pre-existing conditions, many states offered coverage for those folks. (Check 
out the next section for more info.)
Also check with professional or other associations that you belong to, as such 
plans sometimes offer decent benefits at a competitive price because of the 
­purchasing clout they possess. A competent independent insurance agent who 
specializes in health insurance can help you find insurers who are willing to offer 
you coverage.
Health insurance agents have a conflict of interest that’s common to all financial 
salespeople who work on commission: The higher the premium plan they sell you, 
the bigger the commission they earn. So an agent may try to steer you into higher-
cost plans and avoid suggesting some of the cost-reducing strategies that I dis-
cuss in this chapter, such as opting for a higher deductible.
Handling insurance rejection
Before the passage and implementation of Obamacare, those with so-called pre-
existing conditions sometimes got turned down when applying for health insur-
ance or had to pay substantially higher premiums. A similar phenomenon happens 
with other types of insurance when you’re deemed too great a risk. For example, 
you may have problems with getting life or disability insurance or have to pay a 

208      PART 4  Insurance: Protect Yourself, Your Loved Ones, and Your Assets
much greater price if you’re not in the best of health. If you’ve had a bunch of car 
accidents and speeding tickets, obtaining reasonably priced auto insurance may 
be a challenge.
When you try to enroll in a particular life or disability insurance plan (discussed in 
Chapter 15), you may be turned down because of current or previous health prob-
lems. That may happen (but isn’t likely to) in the future with health insurance, 
depending on what happens with Congress and President Trump. If your current 
health causes you to be charged a high premium or be denied coverage outright, 
try these strategies to find out why and get approved:
»
» Ask the insurer why you were denied. If you’re denied coverage because of 
a medical condition, find out what information the company has and deter-
mine whether it’s accurate. Perhaps the company made a mistake or misinter-
preted some information that you provided in your application.
»
» Request a copy of your medical information file. Just as you have a credit 
report file that details your use (and misuse) of credit (see Chapter 4), you also 
have a medical information report. Once per year, you can request a free copy 
of your medical information file (which typically highlights only the more 
significant problems over the past seven years, not your entire medical 
history) by calling 866-692-6901 or visiting www.mib.com (click on “Request 
Your MIB Consumer File”). If you find a mistake on your report, you have the 
right to request that it be fixed. However, the burden is on you to prove that 
the information in your file is incorrect. Proving that your file contains errors 
can be a major hassle — you may even need to contact physicians you saw in 
the past because their medical records may be the source of the incorrect 
information.
»
» Shop around. Just because one company denies you coverage doesn’t mean 
that all insurance companies will deny you. Some insurers better understand 
certain medical conditions and are more comfortable accepting applicants 
with those conditions. Although most insurers charge higher rates to people 
with blemished medical histories than people with perfect health records, 
some companies penalize them less than others. An agent who sells policies 
from multiple insurers, called an independent agent, can be helpful because 
she can shop among a number of different companies.
»
» Find a job with an employer whose insurer doesn’t require a medical 
exam. Of course, this shouldn’t be your only reason for seeking new employ-
ment, but it can be an important factor. If you’re married, you may also be 
able to get into an employer group plan through your spouse’s plan.
»
» Find out about state high-risk pools. A number of states, before the 
­implementation of Obamacare, acted as the insurer of last resort and 
­provided insurance for those who couldn’t get it from insurance companies. 
State high-risk pool coverage is usually quite basic, but it beats going 

CHAPTER 14  The Lowdown on Health Insurance      209
without any coverage. The Health Insurance Resource Center website 
­provides links to all state health coverage high-risk pools on its website at  
www.healthinsurance.org/risk_pools. Alternatively, you can check with 
your state department of insurance (enter your state and “department of 
insurance” into your favorite search engine) for high-risk pools for other types 
of insurance, such as property coverage.
Health Savings Accounts: Tax Reduction 
for Healthcare Costs
Health savings accounts (HSAs) are terrific for reducing your taxes while saving 
money for healthcare expenses. They especially make sense if you’re self-
employed or an employee of a smaller company with no health plan or a high-
deductible health plan.
An HSA is fairly simple: You put money earmarked for medical expenses into an 
investment account that offers tax-deductible contributions and tax-deferred 
compounding, just like a retirement account (withdrawals aren’t taxed so long as 
the money is used for qualified healthcare expenses). For tax year 2017, you can 
sock away up to $3,400 for an individual account and $6,750 for a family account. 
To qualify for an HSA, you must have a high-deductible health insurance policy — 
at least $1,300 for individuals and $2,600 for families.
You don’t have to deplete the HSA by the end of the year: Money can compound 
tax-deferred inside the HSA for years. If you qualify, you can begin to investigate 
an HSA through insurers offering health plans you’re interested in or with the 
company you currently have coverage through (also see my website, www.
erictyson.com, for the latest information on the best HSAs).
You may also be able to save on taxes if you have a substantial amount of health-
care expenditures in a year relative to your income. You can deduct medical and 
dental expenses as an itemized deduction on Schedule A to the extent that they 
exceed 10 percent of your adjusted gross income.
If you expect to have out-of-pocket medical expenses and can’t qualify for an HSA 
because of your employer’s plans, find out whether your employer offers a flexible 
spending or healthcare reimbursement account. These accounts enable you to pay for 
uncovered medical expenses with pretax dollars. If, for example, you’re in a 
­combined 35 percent federal and state income tax bracket, these accounts allow 

210      PART 4  Insurance: Protect Yourself, Your Loved Ones, and Your Assets
you to pay for necessary healthcare at a 35 percent discount. These accounts can 
also be used to pay for vision and dental care.
Be forewarned of the major stumbling blocks you face when saving through medi-
cal reimbursement accounts:
»
» You need to elect to save money from your paycheck prior to the 
beginning of each plan year. The only exception is at the time of a “life 
change,” such as marriage, a spouse’s job change, divorce, the birth of a child, 
or a family member’s death.
»
» You also need to use the money within the year you save it. These 
accounts contain a “use it or lose it” feature.

Safeguarding Your 
Income
I
f you’re like most younger adults and in good health, you probably don’t think 
much about possible health changes. But you should take the right steps to 
make sure you protect your primary source of income in case of an unexpected 
health problem.
If you earn income from working, you probably need some insurance to protect 
that stream of income, not only for yourself but also possibly for loved ones if 
they’re dependent on you financially. In this chapter, I discuss the two forms of 
insurance — disability and life insurance — that can help you address these needs. 
I also discuss other simple yet powerful steps beyond insurance that you can take 
to get things in order for your loved ones.
Protecting Your Income for You and Yours: 
Disability Insurance
Disability insurance protects your income for yourself and perhaps also for your 
dependents. But even if no one depends on you financially, you need long-term 
disability insurance if you depend on your own income. After all, if you become 

212      PART 4  Insurance: Protect Yourself, Your Loved Ones, and Your Assets
disabled, you probably won’t be able to earn employment income, but your living 
expenses will continue. And therein lies the need for disability insurance.
When you’re young and healthy, dismissing the need for disability insurance is 
easy because the odds of suffering a long-term disability seem  — and are  — 
relatively low. But the occurrence of a long-term disability is unpredictable, and 
numerous long-term disabilities affect younger people. Some disabilities happen 
because of accidents, and those can happen to you regardless of age. Others are 
caused by medical problems, and more than one-third of all such disabilities are 
suffered by people under the age of 45. The vast majority of these medical problems 
can’t be predicted in advance.
In the following sections, I assist you with understanding what coverage you may 
already have and determining whether it’s the right amount, how much to get, 
what features to seek in a policy, and where to actually buy a policy.
Understanding disability coverage 
you may already have
Through payroll-deduction payment of taxes, you may have some disability 
­coverage through state and federal government insurance programs. However, 
this coverage is more short term than long term in nature:
»
» State disability programs: A handful of states have disability insurance 
programs, but the coverage is typically Spartan. Benefits are paid over a short 
period of time (usually one year at most). State programs are also generally 
not a good value because of the cost for the small amount of coverage 
they provide.
»
» Social Security disability: Social Security pays long-term benefits only if 
you’re unable to perform any substantial, gainful activity for more than a year 
or if your disability is expected to result in death. Furthermore, Social Security 
disability payments are quite low because they’re intended to provide only for 
basic, subsistence-level living expenses. Also, because you’ve only been 
working for a short amount of time, you haven’t paid much into Social Security 
and thus won’t have a high level of earned benefits.
What about coverage you have through your employer? If you’re self-employed or 
work for a small company, you probably don’t have long-term disability coverage. 
By contrast, most large employers offer disability insurance to their employees. 
Ask your employer’s benefits department for details on your current policy and 
then compare those with the features that I recommend you get on a policy that 
you buy for yourself.

CHAPTER 15  Safeguarding Your Income      213
Workers’ compensation, if you have such coverage through your employer, pays 
out if you’re injured on the job, but it doesn’t pay any benefits if you get disabled 
away from your job. You need coverage that pays no matter where and how you’re 
disabled.
Determining how much disability  
insurance you need
You should carry sufficient long-term disability insurance coverage to provide you 
with income to live on should you become disabled. If you don’t have many finan-
cial assets and you want to maintain your current lifestyle if you suffer a disability, 
get enough coverage to replace your entire monthly take-home (after-tax) pay.
The benefits you purchase on a disability policy are quoted as the dollars per month 
you receive if disabled. So if your job provides you with a $3,000-per-month 
income after taxes, get a policy that provides a $3,000-per-month benefit.
If you pay for your disability insurance, the benefits are tax-free (but hopefully 
you won’t ever have to collect them). If your employer picks up the tab, your ben-
efits are taxable, so you need a greater amount of benefits.
In addition to the monthly coverage amount, you also need to select the duration 
for which you want a policy to pay you benefits. You should select a policy that pays 
benefits until you reach an age at which you become financially self-sufficient. For 
most people, that’s around the age when their Social Security benefits kick in. 
(Folks born after 1959 get full Social Security benefits at age 67 and reduced 
benefits before that age.)
Identifying useful disability policy features
If you go shopping for a long-term disability (LTD) insurance policy, you need to 
master some jargon. LTD policies have plenty of options, some of which you need 
and some of which you don’t. Here’s what you need to know:
»
» Definition of disability: An own-occupation disability policy provides benefit 
payments if you can’t perform the work you normally do. The extra cost of such 
policies is worthwhile if you’re in a high-income or specialized occupation and you’d 
have to take a significant pay cut to do something else (and the reduced income 
and required lifestyle changes wouldn’t be acceptable to you). Other policies pay 
you only if you’re unable to perform a job for which you’re reasonably trained.
»
» Noncancelable and guaranteed renewable: These desirable features ensure 
that your policy can’t be canceled because of your developing health problems.

214      PART 4  Insurance: Protect Yourself, Your Loved Ones, and Your Assets
»
» Waiting period: The lag time between the onset of your disability and the 
time you begin collecting benefits is a disability policy’s deductible.
As with other types of insurance, you should take the highest deductible 
(longest waiting period) that your financial circumstances allow. A longer 
waiting period significantly reduces the policy’s cost. The minimum waiting 
period on most policies is 30 days. The maximum waiting period can be up to 
one to two years. Try a waiting period of three to six months if you have 
sufficient emergency reserves.
»
» Residual benefits: This useful option pays you a partial benefit if you have a 
disability that prevents you from working full time.
»
» Cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs): This feature automatically increases 
your benefit payment by a set percentage annually or in accordance with 
changes in inflation. The advantage of a COLA is that it retains the purchasing 
power of your benefits. A modest COLA, such as 3 percent, is worth having.
»
» Future insurability: This allows you, regardless of health, to buy additional 
coverage in the future. You may benefit from the future insurability option if 
your income is artificially low now and your career trajectory suggests that 
your income will rise significantly in the future.
»
» Insurer’s financial stability: Choose insurers that will be here tomorrow to 
pay your claim. But don’t obsess over the company’s stability; benefits are 
paid even if an insurer fails, because the state or another insurer almost 
always bails out the unstable insurer.
Shopping for coverage
When you start to shop for LTD, focus your attention first on group plans, which 
generally offer the best value. You may have access to buy group disability insurance 
through your employer or a professional association. Just be sure that the group plan 
policy includes the features I discuss and recommend in the preceding section.
If you don’t have access to a group policy, you’ll likely end up buying an individual 
policy through an agent. Some agents are called independent agents because they 
sell policies from numerous insurance companies. Other agents are dedicated to 
selling policies from a single company. Both types are fine to use so long as you 
shop the marketplace and get a policy with the features that I suggest in the pre-
ceding section.
Tread carefully when purchasing disability insurance through an agent. Some 
agents try to load your policy with all sorts of extra bells and whistles to pump up 
the premium — along with their commission.

CHAPTER 15  Safeguarding Your Income      215
Protecting Your Income for Dependents: 
Life Insurance
You generally need life insurance when others, such as a spouse or a child, depend 
on your income, especially if you have major financial commitments such as a 
mortgage or years of child rearing ahead. You may also want to consider life 
insurance if an extended family member currently depends on your income, or is 
likely to do so in the future.
You generally don’t need life insurance if you’re
»
» Single with no children
»
» Part of a working couple that can maintain an acceptable lifestyle on one of 
your incomes
»
» Independently wealthy and don’t need to work
These sections explain how to figure out how much life insurance coverage you 
may already have, how much you need, and how to purchase it.
Assessing your current life  
insurance coverage
In a moment, I discuss how much coverage you may need if you’ve decided you 
need life insurance protection. First, though, take stock of your current coverage. 
Start with your current employer and determine whether the company offers you 
any life insurance coverage at its own expense.
Next, consider possible coverage you may have through Social Security that pro-
vides survivor’s benefits to your spouse and children. Be aware, however, that if 
your surviving spouse works and earns even a modest amount of money, he or she 
will get little, if any, survivor’s benefits. Prior to reaching Social Security’s full 
retirement age (67 for those born after 1959), your survivor’s benefits get reduced 
by $1 for every $2 you earn above $16,920 (in 2017).
If either you or your spouse anticipates earning a low enough income to qualify for 
survivor’s benefits, you should factor those benefits into how much life insurance 
to buy. For example, if your annual after-tax income is $30,000 and Social Secu-
rity provides a survivor’s benefit of $10,000 annually, you’d need enough life 
insurance to replace $20,000 annually ($30,000 – $10,000).

216      PART 4  Insurance: Protect Yourself, Your Loved Ones, and Your Assets
The Social Security Administration (SSA) used to mail an annual statement to 
working adults that showed their earnings history and estimated future Social 
Security benefits. In an effort to save on printing and mailing costs, they no longer 
do this and only mail a statement to those age 60 and older who are not yet col-
lecting benefits and who haven’t set up an online account through the SSA web-
site. If you haven’t reviewed your earnings history and estimated Social Security 
benefits in recent years, be sure to set up an account through www.ssa.gov.
Determining how much life insurance to buy
To figure the amount of life insurance to buy, ask yourself how many years of 
income you want to replace. Table 15-1 provides a simple way to calculate how 
much life insurance you need to consider purchasing. To replace a certain number 
of years’ worth of income, multiply the appropriate number in the table by your 
annual after-tax income. Because life insurance policy payouts aren’t taxed, you 
need to replace only after-tax income and not pre-tax income.
You can figure your annual after-tax income in one of two ways. You can calculate 
it by getting out last year’s tax return (and Form W-2) and subtracting the federal, 
state, and Social Security taxes you paid from your gross employment income. 
Alternatively, you can estimate your annual after-tax income by multiplying your 
gross income by 80 percent if you’re a low-income earner, 70 percent if you’re a 
moderate-income earner, or 60 percent if you’re a high-income earner.
Deciding what type of life insurance to buy
Before you purchase any life insurance, you need to know your options. Life insur-
ance comes in two major types:
»
» Term insurance: You pay an annual premium (as you do for your auto insur-
ance), for which you receive a particular amount of life insurance protection.

CHAPTER 15  Safeguarding Your Income      217
If you die during the term, your beneficiaries collect; otherwise, the premium is 
gone but you’re grateful to be alive!
»
» Cash value insurance: All other life insurance policies (whole, universal, 
variable, and so on) combine life insurance with a supposed savings feature. 
A portion of your premiums is credited to an investment account that grows 
in value over time.
Purchase low-cost term insurance and do your investing separately. Life insur-
ance is rarely a permanent need; over time, you can reduce the amount of term 
insurance you carry as your financial obligations lessen and you accumulate more 
assets. Cash value life insurance makes sense for some people, such as small-
business owners who own a business worth millions of dollars and who don’t 
want their heirs to possibly be forced to sell the business to pay estate taxes in the 
event of their death.
Insurance salespeople aggressively push cash value policies because of the high 
commissions that insurance companies pay them. That’s why these policies 
explicitly penalize you for withdrawing your cash balance within the first seven to 
ten years. You’re paying for these high commissions when you buy one of these 
policies. Also, you’re more likely to buy less life insurance coverage than you need 
because of the high cost of cash value policies relative to the cost of term. The vast 
majority of life insurance buyers need more protection than they can afford to buy 
with cash value coverage.
Shopping for life insurance
You can purchase term life insurance so that your premium increases annually or 
it increases after 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30 years. The advantage of a premium that locks 
in for, say, 20 years is that you have the security of knowing how much you’ll be 
paying each year for the next two decades. You also don’t need to go through 
medical evaluations as frequently to qualify for the lowest rate possible.
The disadvantage of a policy with a long-term rate lock is that you pay more in the 
early years than you do on a policy that adjusts more frequently. In addition, you 
may want to change the amount of insurance you carry as your circumstances 
change. Thus, you may throw money away when you dump a policy with a long-
term premium guarantee before its rate is set to change. Policies that adjust the 
premium every five to ten years offer a balance between price and predictability.
Be sure to get a policy that’s guaranteed renewable, which assures that the policy 
can’t be canceled because of your health worsening. Don’t buy a life insurance 
policy without this feature unless you expect that your life insurance needs will 
disappear when the policy is up for renewal.

MAKING SENSE OF LIFE INSURANCE 
POLICY ILLUSTRATIONS
One of the ways that agents make cash value life insurance appear more attractive is 
through the policy illustrations that they send you during the sales process. To convince 
you to buy cash value life insurance, agents will prepare illustrations (projections) show-
ing you how large the cash value of various policies will grow over the years, and they 
may compare it to after-tax investments. It’s easy for insurers’ illustrations to make 
the cash value life insurance look best by simply skewing the assumptions used in the 
projections.
For example, insurance companies pay a somewhat better interest rate on your cash 
balance in the first year or first few years of the policy. They do this to lure you into a 
policy. However, after that initial period expires, the insurer can set the interest rate 
(your return) at whatever level they desire as long as it’s above whatever minimum is 
delineated in the policy. You can’t get out of the policy in the early years without paying 
a substantial penalty (because the insurer needs to recoup the hefty commissions they 
paid the agent), so don’t think you can simply take your money and run once the inter-
est rate is lowered.
Not to get too technical, but you must keep in mind that the illustrations are based 
upon “actuarial assumptions” made by each insurer. Insurers may assume, for example, 
that their policyholders’ “cost of insurance” (mortality charges for likelihood of dying) 
may be less in the future when in fact there is no basis for that assumption.
Another way that agents can make cash value life insurance seem more attractive is to 
neglect to mention that the policy illustrations don’t show any future taxation. Future 
taxation of the cash value in excess of the premiums that have been paid should be 
considered. You will owe ordinary income tax rates on this money unless you keep the 
policy in force until your passing.
So, don’t pay much attention to policy projections. If you’re going to consider a cash 
value policy, you should instead examine the historic (past) rates of return of given 
insurers and how that compares with their peers. But, be sure to strongly consider the 
pros and cons of term insurance versus cash value policies.

Caring for Your Loved Ones:  
“Peace of Mind” Insurance
Buying an insurance policy isn’t the only thing you should do to provide for your 
loved ones. Consider taking the following steps, most of which involve only your 
time and forethought and no expense:
»
» Centralize your important financial documents. Keep your most recent 
investment account statements, insurance policies, employee benefits 
materials, small-business accounting records, and other important docu-
ments in one place (such as a file drawer) that your loved ones know about. If 
you only access your accounts and statements electronically, be sure your 
loved ones know about your various accounts and policies and how to 
access them.
»
» Prepare an up-to-date will. You can do this yourself with a good software 
package such as those made by Nolo Press (www.nolo.com).
»
» Provide a list of key contacts. This list includes experts you recommend 
calling (or material you recommend reading) in the event of legal, financial, or 
tax quandaries.
»
» Prepare sentimental remembrances. You may want to give some thought 
to sentimental leave-behinds for your loved ones, especially for kids. These 
can be something like a short note telling them how much they meant to you 
and what you’d like them to remember about you.

N
o one likes to pay his hard-earned money to an insurance company. But if 
you were to wreck your car or someone were to break into your home and 
steal some valuable personal property, you’d be mighty unhappy if you 
lacked the right coverage and had to fully pay at your own expense to replace 
those items.
So I understand that reading this chapter isn’t on your short list of fun things to 
do today. But I do promise to clearly explain how to get the insurance protection 
you need on your property and personal possessions and to do so for the best price 
that you can. I also discuss smaller-type insurance policies that are likely to be a 
waste of your money and thus are best avoided.

222      PART 4  Insurance: Protect Yourself, Your Loved Ones, and Your Assets
Protecting Your Home and Possessions: 
Homeowners and Renters Insurance
When you buy a home (typically with a mortgage), the mortgage lender mandates 
that you get homeowners insurance. The lender wants to protect its investment in 
the property for the same reason that you should want to protect your stake in the 
property. This kind of policy insures your personal property and also provides 
some liability protection should a lawsuit arise out of something that happens at 
the property (an accident, for example).
If you’re still renting, you should look into coverage for these same reasons — 
personal property coverage and liability protection.
Although homeowners insurance and renters insurance are completely separate 
policies, they share many important features, which I discuss in the following 
sections.
Dwelling coverage
When you buy a home, you’ll get a policy with dwelling protection, the amount of 
which is determined by the cost of rebuilding in your area. The insurer details the 
size and features of your home so, for example, in the event of a fire that destroys 
the property, you’ll have enough money to rebuild the property and replicate what 
you started with. (If you’re a condominium owner, check out whether the insur-
ance the condo association bought for the entire building is sufficient.)
When buying a homeowners policy, seek out coverage that includes guaranteed 
replacement cost. This ensures that the insurance company will rebuild the home 
even if the cost of construction is more than the policy coverage. If the insurance 
company underestimates your dwelling coverage, it has to make up the difference. 
Each insurer defines guaranteed replacement cost differently, so be sure to ask 
insurers how they define it. Some companies pay for the home’s full replacement 
cost, no matter how much it ends up being, while other insurers set caps or limits. 
For example, some insurers may pay up to only 25 percent more than the dwelling 
coverage on your policy.
When you’re renting, you don’t need to have dwelling protection because you 
don’t have an ownership stake in the building. Should something happen to the 
building, it could, of course, affect your ability to live there or affect your posses-
sions, but those are different matters not covered by dwelling coverage, which is 
strictly for the building’s owner.

CHAPTER 16  Home, Auto, Renters, and Other Insurance Policies      223
Personal property protection
Personal property coverage basically covers the contents of your home — furniture, 
clothing, and other possessions. On a homeowners policy, the amount of personal 
property coverage is usually dictated by the amount of dwelling coverage. For 
example, you may get personal property coverage that’s equal to 50 to 75 percent 
of the dwelling coverage, which should be more than enough for most people.
When you’re renting or you’re the owner of a condominium, you need to select the 
level of personal property coverage you desire. You can estimate this figure by 
totaling up the cost of replacing all your personal items.
You need to have a good grasp of what you own. Take an inventory of all your 
personal property, even if you don’t need to total its value. The best way to do so 
is to take pictures or make a video. Be sure to take an inventory again every year 
or two or after you make some larger purchases. Also consider keeping receipts for 
the bigger-ticket items you buy for documentation purposes. No matter how you 
document your belongings, don’t forget to keep the documentation somewhere 
besides your home — otherwise, it could be destroyed along with the rest of your 
house in a fire or other disaster.
I generally don’t recommend paying for a rider for extra coverage (a rider is add-
on coverage that specifically covers particular items not covered in your standard 
policy) unless you have items of significant value (such as artwork, jewelry, and 
so on).
Liability insurance
We live in a litigious society, so even though you may rightfully say the odds of 
someone suing you over an incident at your home are low, there’s still a risk. 
Liability insurance protects you against legal claims due to an injury that occurs on 
your property. Get enough liability insurance to cover one to two times your 
financial assets.
As a renter, it’s potentially useful to have liability protection. So in addition to 
insuring your personal property, another useful feature with renters insurance is 
liability coverage.
Natural disaster protection
A deficiency of homeowners insurance is that it generally doesn’t cover damage to 
your home and personal property caused by earthquakes and floods. To cover such 
situations, you need to buy separate natural disaster protection coverage.

224      PART 4  Insurance: Protect Yourself, Your Loved Ones, and Your Assets
The Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety website (disastersafety.
org) has a useful feature where you can input your zip code and see what types of 
risks from natural disasters you face.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides coverage of up to 
$250,000 for your dwelling and $100,000 for your personal property. Some pri-
vate insurers also sell flood insurance policies that you should comparison shop 
with the FEMA policy. Private insurers can accommodate higher-value properties 
and also include loss of use coverage so you have money to rent a replacement 
property while your dwelling is repaired or rebuilt.
The website FloodTools.com can show you the relative flood risk for a given 
address and where floods have occurred historically nearby. You can also see how 
many flood insurance claims have been filed in your area over the past decade and 
the average dollar amount of those claims.
In terms of costs, for example, if your insurer estimates it would cost $200,000 to 
rebuild your home, you can buy a flood insurance policy through FEMA that pro-
vides $200,000 of building coverage and $80,000 of contents coverage for about 
$467 annually if you live in a low-risk area. If you’re a renter, simply get the 
$80,000 contents-only coverage for $280 per year.
Inquire with your current insurer or the insurers you shop among (such as those 
I recommend later in this chapter). If the cost of flood or earthquake insurance 
seems expensive, compare that expense to the costs you’d likely incur should your 
home and personal property be a total loss.
Shopping for homeowners insurance
To get the best homeowners insurance for the least cost, you can be proactive. Try 
these money-saving strategies:
»
» Take a high deductible. Because the objective of homeowners insurance is 
to protect against large losses, not small ones, take the highest deductible 
with which you’re comfortable. Take into consideration how large an emer-
gency reserve you have and the stability of your employment income.
»
» Ask about special discounts. If your property has a security system or you 
have other policies with the same insurer, you may qualify for a lower rate.
»
» Improve your credit score. Many insurers use your credit score (see 
Chapter 4) as a factor in setting some of your insurance rates. They do this 

CHAPTER 16  Home, Auto, Renters, and Other Insurance Policies      225
because their studies have shown that folks who have higher credit 
scores  tend to have fewer insurance claims.
»
» Shop around. Each insurance company prices its homeowners and rent-
ers policies based on its own criteria. So the lowest-cost company for your 
friend’s property may not be the lowest-cost company for you. You have to 
shop around at several companies to find the best rates. Here’s a list of 
companies that usually have lower-cost policies and do a decent job with 
customer satisfaction and claims paying:
•	 Amica: This company isn’t the cheapest but it boasts consistently high 
customer-service ratings. Call Amica at 800-242-6422 or visit its website 
at www.amica.com.
•	 Erie Insurance: This firm operates mainly in the Midwest and Mid-
Atlantic region. Check your local phone listings for agents. Call 800-458- 
0811 for a referral to a local agent or visit the company’s website at www.
erieinsurance.com.
•	 GEICO: You can contact this company by calling (800) 241-8098 or by 
visiting its website at www.geico.com.
•	 Liberty Mutual: Check your local phone listings for agents, call 800-837- 
5254, or visit the company’s website at www.libertymutual.com.
•	 Nationwide Mutual: Check your local phone listings for agents, call 
877-669-6877, or visit the company’s website at www.nationwide.com.
•	 State Farm: Check your local phone listings for agents, call 800-782-8332, 
or visit the company’s website at www.statefarm.com.
•	 USAA: This company offers insurance to members of the military and 
their families. Call the company at 800-531-8722 or visit its website at 
www.usaa.com to see whether you qualify.
If you’re interested in more information specific to your state, you may benefit 
from the information that your state insurance department collects regarding 
insurers’ prices and complaints (not all states do this, however). Look up your 
state’s department of insurance phone number online, or visit the National Asso-
ciation of Insurance Commissioners website at www.naic.org/state_web_map.htm 
to find links to each state’s department of insurance site.

226      PART 4  Insurance: Protect Yourself, Your Loved Ones, and Your Assets
DRIVING SAFELY
Without a doubt, the most dangerous thing you probably do is get behind the wheel of 
a car or travel as a passenger in someone else’s vehicle. Yet, many people give insuffi-
cient thought to taking sensible measures to reduce their risk in cars.
For starters, we minimize and trivialize the risk. We say things to ourselves such as, 
“I drive short distances,” or “My large SUV will protect me.”
Car buyers often do little if any research on the safety records of cars they ultimately 
buy. Only 12 percent (about one in eight) of prospective new-car buyers said in a survey 
that safety features were the most important consideration in their planned purchases.
Compounding the fact that many people don’t research and buy the safest cars, we 
overestimate how good our driving skills are. Consider how drivers responded to the 
following multiple-choice options in a survey conducted by the Insurance Institute for 
Highway Safety:
•	 My driving skills are much better or better than average: 74 percent
•	 My driving skills are average: 25 percent
•	 My driving skills are below average: 1 percent
Seventy-four times as many people said their driving skills were above average than 
those who said they were below average! And, 99 percent of all respondents rated their 
skills as average or above! Clearly, that can’t possibly be the case in the real world.
More than 30,000 people die annually (more than 2,500 monthly) in accidents on 
America’s roads. That’s a heck of a lot of people — it’s like having a 9/11 terrorist attack 
almost monthly.
Although this number has declined over the decades, it’s still sad and tragically high, 
especially when you consider that many of these deaths are preventable. Here’s what 
you can do to be on the good side of those statistics: 
•	 Drive a safe car. Don’t make the mistake of assuming that driving a safe vehicle 
requires buying a $50,000 high-end car. You don’t need to spend buckets of money 
to get a car with desirable safety features. Visit www.safercar.gov/Vehicle-
Shoppers for up-to-date information on the safety ratings on new and used cars.
•	 Drive safely. Wear your seat belt! A U.S. Department of Transportation study found 
that 60 percent of auto passengers who were killed were not wearing their seat 
belts. Stay within the speed limit and don’t drive while you’re intoxicated or tired. 

CHAPTER 16  Home, Auto, Renters, and Other Insurance Policies      227
Insuring Your Car
Although cars can be money pits, most people need them to get around. Cars are 
popular for good reason. You can transport yourself when and where you want in 
a car.
Especially if you live an urban area where you may have to pay for parking, if you 
don’t anticipate using a car frequently, consider not having one. In addition to 
public transit, you can use cabs and services like Lyft and Uber and/or rent a car 
from time to time. Some young adults borrow their friends’ cars — be sure to 
work out a fair payment arrangement and understand your insurance coverage.
To evaluate buying your own car, tally the annual cost of having your own dedi-
cated car. Use Edmunds “True Cost to Own” calculator at www.edmunds.com/tco.
html to see what it will cost you year by year over the first five years of owning a 
given make and model of a car. (Note: If you’re smart and save to pay for your car 
in cash, be sure to subtract the financing costs that Edmunds assumes in its cal-
culations. You may also want to tinker with some of its other assumptions if, for 
example, you anticipate driving much less or more than assumed in the 
calculations.)
If you choose to own a car, you can take important steps to minimize the car’s 
costs. You need insurance, but you don’t need to waste money on it. This section 
explains exactly what you need.
Liability protection
Because of the inevitable accidents that happen with cars, auto insurance provides 
liability protection for injury caused to people and property. In fact, most states 
And don’t try to talk or text on your cellphone while driving. Use hands-free devices 
and minimize conversations while on the road.
•	 Stay off the roads during the most dangerous times. Extensive driving in the 
very late night/early morning hours and on major holidays (New Year’s Eve, 
Independence Day, and so on) is asking for trouble given the preponderance of 
drunk drivers on the road. Also, be thoughtful about going on the road when the 
weather creates hazardous driving conditions.

228      PART 4  Insurance: Protect Yourself, Your Loved Ones, and Your Assets
require this coverage by law. Liability protection comes in a couple of different 
forms:
»
» Bodily injury liability: This type covers injury to people. You should have 
sufficient bodily injury liability insurance to ideally cover at least twice the 
value of your assets.
If you have little in the way of assets, know that your future earnings may be 
garnished in a lawsuit.
»
» Property damage liability: This type covers the property, which includes 
other people’s cars. The level of property-damage liability coverage in an auto 
policy is generally set based on the amount of bodily injury liability protection. 
Coverage of $50,000 is a good minimum to start with.
»
» Uninsured or underinsured liability: Auto policies also allow you to buy 
liability coverage for other motorists you may have an accident with who lack 
coverage or whose liability protection is minimal. This uninsured or underin-
sured motorist liability coverage allows you to collect for lost wages, medical 
expenses, and pain and suffering incurred in the accident.
If you already have comprehensive health and long-term disability insurance, 
uninsured or underinsured motorist liability coverage isn’t really necessary. 
Just be aware that if you skip this coverage, you can’t sue for general pain and 
suffering or insure passengers in your car who may lack adequate medical 
and disability coverage.
Collision and comprehensive
Collision coverage applies to claims arising from collisions of your car (and usually 
covers cars you rent as well). Comprehensive coverage is for claims for damage not 
caused by collision. For example, comprehensive coverage would cover damage 
done by someone breaking into your car.
Both collision and comprehensive coverage have their own deductible. For reduced 
auto insurance premiums, take the highest deductibles you can comfortably afford 
(I suggest at least $500 and ideally $1,000).
As your car ages and declines in value, you can eventually eliminate your compre-
hensive and collision coverage. Remember that insurers won’t pay you more than 
your car’s book value, regardless of what it costs to repair or replace it. You can 
easily research your car’s approximate current value on websites such as Kelley 
Blue Book (www.kbb.com).

CHAPTER 16  Home, Auto, Renters, and Other Insurance Policies      229
Riders you should bypass
You can add various optional coverages, known as riders, which appear to be inex-
pensive but really aren’t when you compare the cost against the small amount of 
protection they provide. Here are common ones that auto insurers and agents 
pitch and that I would generally bypass:
»
» Roadside assistance and towing: These provisions provide coverage if your 
car breaks down. You may already have this protection if you belong to an 
auto club like AAA.
»
» Rental car reimbursement: This rider provides for a limited coverage 
amount for a rental car should your car be stolen or damaged and not 
drivable.
»
» Riders that waive the deductible under certain circumstances: The point 
of the deductible is to reduce your policy cost and eliminate the hassle of filing 
small claims.
»
» Medical payments coverage: This coverage typically pays a few thousand 
dollars for medical expenses. If you and your passengers carry major medical 
insurance coverage, this rider isn’t really necessary. Besides, a few thousand 
dollars of medical coverage doesn’t protect you against catastrophic 
expenses.
Getting a good buy
In the previous sections, I explain what you do and don’t need on your auto insur-
ance policy. Here are some additional ways to get the most for your money:
»
» Consider insurance costs before buying your (next) car. The cost of 
insuring a car should factor into your decision of which car you buy, because 
the insurance costs represent a major operating expense. Call insurers and 
ask for insurance price quotes for the different models you’re considering 
before you buy.
»
» Ask for special discounts. A security alarm, antilock brakes, or having 
another policy with the same insurer may qualify your car for lower rates. And 
make sure you’re given appropriate “good driver” discounts if you’ve been 
accident- and ticket-free in recent years. Some insurers may not penalize you 
for one recent ticket — ask what their policy is.
»
» Shop among the best companies. Use the insurers list I provide in the 
“Shopping for homeowners insurance” section earlier in this chapter to obtain 
quotes for auto insurance. In addition, also try Progressive (800-776-4737; 
www.progressive.com).

230      PART 4  Insurance: Protect Yourself, Your Loved Ones, and Your Assets
UMBRELLAS AREN’T JUST 
FOR BAD WEATHER
A good problem is having enough assets that you need additional liability protection 
beyond what’s economical and available to buy on a home and auto policy. Enter excess 
liability insurance (also known as umbrella insurance), which is additional liability insurance 
that’s added on top of the liability protection on your home and car(s).
Expect to pay $200+ annually for $1 million of coverage. Each year, thousands of people 
suffer lawsuits of more than $1 million related to their cars and homes.
So how do you decide how much you need if you have a lot of assets? You should have 
at least enough liability insurance to protect your assets, and preferably enough to 
cover twice the value of those assets.

from the rest
Using Media Resources
T
echnology and the Internet have changed the way people tap the vast and 
increasing amount of financial information and advice. Television, radio, 
magazines, and newspapers continue to attract plenty of eyeballs and lis-
teners, of course, but those media have had to adapt and will continue to evolve 
because of the pressures of competition.
When I was a teenager and first took notice of the financial world, I was capti-
vated, and so I observed, read, and learned all that I could about it. It’s no sur-
prise, then, that I landed in my current profession! What’s amazing to me is how 
much things have changed and how much they haven’t changed over the decades.
What has dramatically changed is where and how you can get financial advice and 
information. In the old days, you could consult lots of newspapers (especially The 
Wall Street Journal), some financial magazines, Wall Street Week on PBS television, 
and investment newsletters. Today, you can still refer to these sources for infor-
mation (although fewer newspapers are around), and in addition, cable TV has 
seen a sharp increase in financial coverage on its many channels, and the Internet 
has tremendous numbers of financial websites and blogs.
What has stayed the same are the time-tested and common-sense principles of 
sound personal financial management and wise investments. Prognosticators 
who claim that they have a system for beating the system and the ability to pro-
duce fat profits are nothing new, and neither are the crooks who defraud folks out 
of their hard-earned money.

234      PART 5  Your Information Diet
The challenge with all this financial information, advice, and predictions is to 
understand what’s worth paying attention to and paying for and what you should 
ignore and perhaps even run away from! In this chapter, I discuss the various sources 
of financial advice and information and how to separate the best from the rest.
Going Online: The Wild West  
of Advice and Predictions
What has changed the most in recent years about financial advice and information 
is the enormous growth of the Internet. As with any medium, however, you need 
to remember the “buyer beware” mentality when looking for financial advice 
online. You can find lots of “free” stuff online, and therein lies one of the great 
dangers of the online world. I discuss this danger in this section, as well as how to 
make the most of what’s useful on the Internet.
Eyeing the real cost of “free”
Whenever you read a personal finance article online that you don’t have to pay for, 
ask yourself one simple question: How can the website purveyor afford to hire 
competent personal finance experts to write articles for the website? The answer 
for many sites is that they hope to make money from advertising. Their desire to 
make income from advertisers inevitably causes problems for you, dear reader, 
because it means that the website owner has to be careful to offer content that 
first and foremost is attractive for advertisers. As a result, websites may shy away 
from valid criticisms of various financial products, services, and firms. So what 
you may consider to be “free” content may actually have a hefty cost to you if it 
offers faulty advice that causes you future headaches and pain.
In the worst cases — and unfortunately, this is becoming increasingly common — 
companies pay websites to post flattering reviews of their products and services. 
Print publications generally have a tradition of disclosing when an article is paid 
advertising (known as an advertorial), but in the Wild West online, many sites fail 
to make this important disclosure. I’m not saying that disclosure makes advertorial 
content okay — but a failure to disclose makes an already bad situation even worse.
Also beware of links to recommended product and service providers to do business 
with. More often than not, the referring website gets paid an affiliate fee, some-
times amounting to 30, 40, or even 50+ percent of the product price. Look for sites 
that post policies against receiving such referral fees from companies whose 
products and services they recommend. (As an example, see the disclosure I use 
on my site, www.erictyson.com.)

CHAPTER 17  Using Media Resources      235
Being aware online
If you want to best manage your personal finances and find out more, remember 
that the old expression “you get what you pay for” contains a grain of truth. Free 
information on the Internet, especially information provided by companies in the 
financial-services industry, is largely self-serving.
AN INSIDE LOOK AT THE LACK OF 
JOURNALISTIC STANDARDS ONLINE
One day not long ago, I received an email from “John,” who said he was interested in 
promoting my company through his blog and invited me to call him for more information.
Normally, I would simply hit delete and get on with my workday. However, when I visited 
the sender’s website, I found the following description:
“Our research department goes to great lengths to discover bloggers who possess cre-
ative, informative, and entertaining qualities and to then present these bloggers to you, 
with their respective links, on the . . . blogger platform. We encourage our readers to click 
on these links to learn more about the blogger and their writings.”
Now, I was a bit curious, so I called “John.” After the perfunctory greetings, John pro-
ceeded to tell me how much he would love to have some of my columns on his compa-
ny’s website and essentially regurgitated the preceding paragraph. He then told me how 
many hundreds of dollars I would have to pay them to have my articles published on 
their website! And, he said, that he’d be willing to publish as many of my articles as I’d 
like. They don’t do that for just anyone, he told me, implying that they usually limit how 
many of an author’s articles they will publish. (I guess my track record and credentials 
are worth something!)
There is a precedent for this type of “advertorial” publishing in the print world. If you’ve 
ever gotten those glossy newsletters “featuring” a small company stock you’ve never 
heard of before, more often than not, those are paid ads by the company being pro-
moted. In the print world, there’s usually a disclosure for such advertorials, albeit too 
small for my taste in most cases.
What is shameful, extraordinarily misleading, and unethical is the complete lack of 
disclosure on this well-trafficked website that the “articles” they are publishing are paid 
advertorials. Sadly, such corrupted content is all too common online, especially and 
including the financial space about which I write. Alas, increasing numbers of companies 
are connecting advertisers looking to promote their products with bloggers wanting to 
earn money by saying flattering things about the companies paying them.

236      PART 5  Your Information Diet
You can run into many pitfalls if you rely only on the web for financial advice or if 
you trust certain information without being certain of its accuracy. Keep the fol-
lowing warnings in mind:
»
» Beware of the short-term focus and addictive nature encouraged by 
many websites. Many financial websites provide real-time stock quotes as a 
hook to a site that’s cluttered with advertising. My experience in working with 
individual investors is that the more short term they think, the worse they do. 
And checking your portfolio during the trading day certainly promotes 
short-term thinking. Another way that sites create an addictive environment 
for you to return to multiple times daily is to constantly provide news and 
other rapidly changing content.
»
» Beware of tips offered around the electronic water cooler. As in the real 
world, chatting with strangers and exchanging ideas is sometimes fine. However, 
if you don’t know the identity and competence of online commenters, why would 
you follow their financial advice or stock tips? Online postings and comments are 
rife with day traders spreading exaggerations and lies to boost stock prices by a 
small amount and profit on a quick sale. Getting ideas from various sources is 
okay, but always verify the info with reliable sources. Educate yourself and do 
your homework before making personal financial decisions.
»
» Stay away from the financial-planning advice offered by financial-
services companies that are out to sell you something you don’t really 
need or that doesn’t offer good value. Such companies can’t take the 
necessary objective, holistic view required to render useful advice.
Using the web for gathering information
If you’re looking for quality material written by unbiased experts or writers, find-
ing it on the web may seem like searching for the proverbial needle in the hay-
stack, because much of what’s online is biased and uninformed. Although I suggest 
you refer to proven professionals off-line, you can still use the web in your per-
sonal financial research.
The following are some important financial tasks you can use the Internet for 
when gathering information, along with a short list of websites I recommend:
»
» Planning for retirement: Good retirement-planning online tools can help you 
plan for retirement by crunching the numbers for you. They can teach you how, 
for example, changes in your investment returns, the rate of inflation, or your  
savings rate can affect when and in what style you can retire. T. Rowe Price’s 
website (www.troweprice.com) has several tools that can help you determine  
where you stand in terms of reaching a given retirement goal. Vanguard’s website 
(www.vanguard.com) can help with figuring savings goals to reach retirement goals.

CHAPTER 17  Using Media Resources      237
»
» Researching and trading investments: You can choose from among many 
sites for dealing with your investments. The Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) allows unlimited, free access to its documents at www.sec.
gov. All public corporations, as well as mutual funds, file their reports with the 
agency. Be aware, however, that navigating this site takes patience. If you do 
your investing homework, trading securities online can save you money and 
time. Online brokers such as E*TRADE Financial (800-387-2331; www.etrade.
com) and Scottrade (800-619-7283; www.scottrade.com) have set a new, 
KEEPING AN EYE OPEN FOR THE AGENDA 
OF EXPENSE-TRACKING SITES AND APPS
Plenty of folks have trouble saving money and reducing their spending. Thus, it’s no sur-
prise that in the increasingly crowded universe of free websites and apps, plenty of sites 
and apps are devoted to supposedly helping you reduce your spending. These include 
Geezeo, Mint, Mvelopes, Wally, and Yodlee.
I’ve reviewed these sites and have mixed-to-negative feelings about them. The biggest 
problem I have with them is that they’re loaded with advertising and/or have affiliate 
relationships with companies (meaning that the site gets paid if you click on a link to 
one of its recommended service providers and buy what the provider is selling).
This arrangement, of course, creates an enormous conflict of interest and thoroughly 
taints any recommendation made by these sites that profit from affiliate referrals. For 
starters, they have no incentive or reason to recommend companies that don’t pay 
them an affiliate fee. And there’s little, if any, screening of companies for quality service 
levels that are important to you as a consumer.
Also, be forewarned that after registering as a site user, the first thing most of these 
sites want you to do is connect directly to your financial institutions (banks, brokerages, 
investment companies, and so on) and download your investment account and spend-
ing data. Yes, you should have security concerns, but those pale in comparison to pri-
vacy concerns and concerns about the endless pitching to you of products and services.
Another problem I have with these websites is the incredibly simplistic calculators they 
use. One site that purports to help with retirement planning doesn’t allow users to 
choose a retirement age younger than 62 and has no provisions for part-time work. 
When this site asks about your assets, it makes no distinction between equity in your 
home and financial assets (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and so on).
Finally, if you encounter a problem when using these sites, they generally offer no 
phone support, so you’re relegated to ping-ponging emails in the hopes of getting your 
questions answered.

lower-cost standard. The major mutual fund companies, such as T. Rowe Price 
and Vanguard, also offer competitive online services.
»
» Buying life insurance: If loved ones are financially dependent on you, you 
probably know you need some life insurance. The best way to shop for term 
life insurance online is through one of the quotation services that I discuss in 
Chapter 15. At each of these sites, you fill in your date of birth, whether you 
smoke, how much coverage you’d like, and for how long you’d like to lock in 
the initial premium. When you’re done filling in this information, you’re 
provided with a list of low-cost quotes from highly rated insurance companies.
Some of the best websites allow you to more efficiently access information that may 
help you make important investing decisions. However, this doesn’t mean your 
computer allows you to compete at the same level as professional money managers. 
No, the playing field isn’t level. The best pros in money management work at their 
craft full time and have far more expertise and experience than the rest of us. Some 
nonprofessionals have been fooled into believing that investing online makes them 
better investors. My experience has been that people who spend time online every 
day dealing with investments tend to react more to short-term events and have a 
harder time keeping the bigger picture and their long-term goals and needs in focus.
Getting Financial Perspectives  
and Advice from the Media
I’m well acquainted with the media. I used to write a regular financial advice column 
for the Sunday San Francisco Chronicle, and I continue to write a syndicated newspaper 
column (so long as some newspapers are still in existence!) and write regularly for 
my own website (www.erictyson.com). I’ve done thousands of interviews in various 
mediums, including radio, television, podcasts, and print (magazines, newspapers, 
and many websites). So I’ve gotten an inside perspective that spans many years.
Being a smart news consumer
As with any profession, I’ve seen a range of expertise among the media people I’ve 
worked with. Here are some important things for you to keep in mind as a con-
sumer of the media’s personal finance coverage and coverage in general:
»
» Remember that most reporters have little — and in some cases no — 
expertise regarding personal finance. The best reporters are careful to 
write only about topics they have sufficient knowledge to tackle or topics for 
which they’re willing and able to interview plenty of experts. Numerous 

CHAPTER 17  Using Media Resources      239
personal finance articles and media pieces have errors and poorly reasoned 
premises, so beware and be educated in order to separate the best 
from the rest.
»
» Be aware that the quest for ratings leads to hype. Some news producers, 
in their quest for ratings and advertising dollars, try to be alarming to keep 
you tuned in and coming back for their “breaking news” updates. The more 
you watch, the more unnerved you get over short-term — especially 
negative — events. This can cause paralysis and unnecessary trading.
»
» Reduce your exposure to advertising and the messages to spend, spend, 
and spend. Coverage of movie stars and other celebrities implicitly and 
explicitly conveys that your worth as a person is related to your physical 
appearance (including the quality of clothing and jewelry you wear) and your 
material possessions — cars, homes, electronics, and other gadgets. Please 
don’t buy into that false message.
»
» Beware the catering to short attention spans. Producers and network 
executives believe that if their content goes into too much detail, viewers and 
listeners will change the channel or turn the page. Many articles include more 
graphics and pictures than words to keep the reader’s interest. Incomplete 
analysis can cause you to make poorly informed decisions.
»
» Ignore the endless pundits who are interviewed for their predictions 
about the stock market, interest rates, and anything else that moves in 
the financial markets. Prognosticating pundits keep many people tuned in 
because their advice is constantly changing (and is therefore entertaining and 
anxiety producing), and they lead investors to believe that investments can be 
maneuvered in advance to outfox future financial market moves. Remember: 
No one has a working crystal ball.
Separating the best from the rest
So should you ignore and shun all the media’s personal finance coverage? Of 
course not  — you simply need to distinguish between good and not-so-good 
financial information and advice. Here’s how:
»
» Pay attention to reporters’ names and their strengths and weaknesses 
as you read articles. As you read a given publication over time, you should 
begin to make note of the different writers. Get to know who the better 
writers are so you can spend your limited free time reading the best.
»
» Review older articles and shows. Although doing so may seem silly and point-
less, it can actually be enlightening. By reviewing a number of past issues or shows 
in one sitting, you can begin to get a flavor for a publication’s style, priorities, and 
philosophies (and you can also see how its past predictions turned out).

240      PART 5  Your Information Diet
»
» Look for solid information and perspective. Headlines reveal a lot about 
how a columnist and publication perceive their roles. Sensationalist stories 
such as “The Next Meltdown Is Coming in 2018” and “These 13 ‘Tipping Points’ 
Have Us on the Edge of a Depression” are playing into people’s fears. Look for 
articles that seek to educate rather than make short-term predictions and 
create anxiety.
»
» Keep your big-picture issues in mind. Have you gotten your overall personal 
financial plan set? That’s an important consideration when contemplating any 
specific financial advice you may hear or read.
»
» Read the best books for a crash course on a given financial topic. Good 
books can go into depth on a topic in a way that simply isn’t possible with 
other resources. Good books also aren’t cluttered with advertising and the 
conflicts inherent therein. (The worst ones are nothing more than infomercials 
to send you overpriced seminars, audiotapes, and so on.) For an updated list 
of my favorites, see my website at www.erictyson.com.
Trusting unnamed “sources” is a bad idea
Increasing numbers of articles (“journalism”) are being published, especially 
online, with information and comments from the infamous unnamed sources. 
This approach is now widely used and can affect the quality of reporting that takes 
place. Back in 2010, a blog named the “Anonymous Source Tracker” on the (now-
defunct) website www.inkstainedwretch.com made a valiant effort to count the 
instances of anonymous source usage in the media. Today, there are daily exam-
ples published on the Anonymous Source Tracker at schaver.com/anonymous.
With “breaking news,” I see much more use of unnamed sources being cited. 
Unfortunately, this seems to correlate with a greater incidence of inaccurate 
information. In the rush to be first or quick with breaking news (especially with 
all the added pressure from online “news”), journalists and the organizations that 
they write for are less likely (and frankly able) to fact-check and independently 
verify what an unnamed source is telling them.
So, why do sources want to remain anonymous? There can be a number of differ-
ent reasons, including, for example:
»
» The source is violating his organization’s confidentiality policies and would get 
fired for divulging said information with his name attached to it as the source.
»
» The source wants to harm or damage the reputation of a person she consid-
ers an enemy or competitor.

CHAPTER 17  Using Media Resources      241
»
» The source desires to get attention from fawning media people and wants to 
feel important and at the center of something exciting.
»
» The source fears retribution from a person made to look bad by release of the 
information.
Now, if you stop and think about each of the preceding scenarios, the first three of 
the four that I listed don’t reflect particularly well on the anonymous source. The 
last listed reason is the most reasonable of the four, although some might say that 
you should have the backbone to attach your name to specific criticism rather than 
doing so anonymously.
Out of curiosity, I checked with the Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ) to see 
what they say about the use of anonymous sources. Interestingly, the SPJ Code of 
Ethics contains two specific statements on the subject, which strongly suggest 
that the American news media overuses anonymous sources. Here’s a summary of 
their advice:
»
» Identify sources whenever appropriate. The public expects journalists to be 
credible, and that expectation is built on the reliability of sources that journalists 
use. The use of unnamed sources should be minimized. If an unnamed source 
must be used, the journalist should identify the source as clearly as possible 
without providing information that would allow the source to be identified.
»
» Question a source’s motives before agreeing to his request for anonymity. 
Some sources provide information only when it benefits them. When a 
journalist receives a request from a source to remain anonymous, the 
reporter should analyze the reasons for the request, which may include 
pushing a personal agenda, advancing a position ahead of a competitor’s or a 
rival’s, or attacking an opponent. If the journalist determines that the source 
has a good reason to be granted anonymity, the journalist should clarify the 
conditions of anonymity in exchange for the information the reporter is 
seeking.
My own approach to citing sources largely follows these two major points the SPJ 
makes. That’s why I almost never use unnamed sources in my writing. Some-
times, folks at particular companies are willing to talk to me for background pur-
poses only, and I’m happy to listen to them so long as my research suggests they 
are trustworthy and credible. However, I always seek to independently verify what 
an anonymous source tells me.
Be very careful reading and accepting journalism that is littered with anony-
mously sourced comments and content. More often than not, it suggests lazy and 
rushed journalists and contains errors that the reporter didn’t discover due to 
insufficient fact checking.

242      PART 5  Your Information Diet
Understanding that political partisans 
are hazardous to your wealth
All networks, publications, and journalists have their biases. I don’t have a prob-
lem with opinion shows that are clearly labeled as such. The public clearly has an 
appetite for some of them — how else can you explain the success of MSNBC, 
CNN, and FOX opinion shows? It’s well known and documented that most MSNBC 
and CNN commentators tilt left politically while FOX shows tilt right. I’m not sug-
gesting that you or anyone else should watch or like such programs.
Now, you may ask what all of this has to do with managing your money.
Political partisans distort the news rather than report the news and prevent you 
from better understanding what’s really going on so you can make informed deci-
sions. For example, during the 2008 financial crisis, Keith Olbermann and his 
liberal partisan pals at MSNBC seemed to take delight in blasting President Bush 
for the nation’s economic problems. In short, they hyped the bad news during 
2008 and accused Bush of causing a Depression. I know some liberal folks who 
panicked and dumped their stocks late in 2008 because they became convinced 
that the unfolding economic calamity made sense given the failed policies of Bush.
Political partisans on the right, such as Glenn Beck and Ann Coulter, can cause bad 
decision making as well. Both Beck and Coulter continually attacked President 
Obama and his policies and suggested that the United States was headed for ruin 
and bankruptcy under his watch. Stock prices rebounded sharply during his presi-
dency, and the economy steadily grew, albeit slowly, during those years.
Political partisans overstate the impact that the President and others can have 
over our economy and financial markets. The financial crisis of 2008 was caused 
by a multitude of factors and frankly was a bi-partisan effort. Blaming it on one 
party or one politician is absurd. Remember that political partisans distort the 
news rather than report the news and prevent you from better understanding 
what’s really going on so you can make informed financial decisions. Focus on 
your goals and working toward them, and seek to remain emotionally detached 
from the political noise around you.

Professionals You Hire
O
ne of the benefits of living in a country with a relatively high standard of 
living is that many service providers are available for hire. Professionals 
can help with an array of services, but at a cost, and they aren’t for every-
one. When you’re young and have a limited income, you probably can’t afford to 
hire a fleet of financial, tax, legal, and other advisors.
Or perhaps you choose not to hire an army of professional advisors because you 
enjoy doing certain tasks yourself or you simply aren’t comfortable delegating a 
task to someone you hire. Doing certain tasks yourself helps you broaden and 
enrich your hands-on knowledge, which can pay off down the road.
Whether or not you choose to hire a professional, having a firm understanding of 
a professional’s role can help you make a wise choice. In this chapter, I discuss 
making the decision to hire help and the common advisors you may consider hir-
ing. For each of these professionals, I offer tips on finding competent and ethical 
advice at a reasonable price.
Seeing the Value of Professional Advice
Making the best personal financial decisions requires knowledge, research, and 
good judgment. Don’t expect perfection — you can do just about everything right, 
but things may not work the way you hoped for reasons beyond your control. That 
doesn’t mean, however, that you shouldn’t bother working to maximize your 

244      PART 5  Your Information Diet
chances of making the best decisions given a reasonable input of time and energy 
on your part.
I was pleasantly surprised when I read Steven Scott’s book, The Richest Man Who 
Ever Lived: King Solomon’s Secrets to Success, Wealth, and Happiness (Crown Business). 
Books with a title such as this give me cause to pause. But, the book had some 
practical and powerful information.
In discussing how to make wise decisions, Scott cites the timeless wisdom from 
Solomon’s book of Proverbs. Throughout Proverbs, Scott says, Solomon high-
lights the value of seeking outside counsel:
“Where no counsel is, the people fall. But in a multitude of counselors, there is safety.”
Solomon also discussed the value in finding wise counsel and sidestepping the 
rest:
“He that walks with wise men shall become wise. But a companion of fools shall be 
destroyed.”
Because I write financial advice books and columns, some people erroneously 
think that I’m a so-called “do-it-yourself” advocate. I am not. People who read 
my books and columns are seeking wisdom and information, and I do my best to 
meet their needs and expectations.
At critical junctures, hiring competent and ethical help pays off. Too often, though, 
people fail to hire the right expert and fail to do enough homework before making 
the hiring decision.
Considering Financial Advisors
I worked for more than a decade as an hourly based financial advisor. During and 
since that time, I’ve fielded many questions from readers about their ups and 
downs with financial advisors. The main question you have to ask yourself is 
whether you even want to use a financial advisor. The following sections help you 
answer that question, locate quality professionals, and figure out what to ask 
before you hire.
Preparing to hire a financial advisor
I firmly believe that you’re your own best financial advisor. However, some people 
don’t want to make financial decisions without getting assistance. Perhaps you’re 

CHAPTER 18  Professionals You Hire      245
busy or you simply can’t stand making money decisions. And if you shy away from 
numbers, a good planner can help you.
Because I hear from many readers about problems with hiring incompetent and 
unethical financial advisors, before you hire a financial advisor, you need to 
understand the following points:
»
» Educate yourself. You need to know enough about the topic so you can at least 
tell whether the financial advisor you may hire knows his stuff. For starters, how 
can you possibly hope to evaluate the expertise of a particular financial advisor 
if you’re not at least modestly educated on the topic yourself? Most personal 
financial decisions aren’t that complex, so the more you know, the more 
responsibility you can take for making the best decisions for your situation.
»
» Understand how compensation creates conflicts of interest. When finan-
cial consultants/advisors sell products that earn them sales commissions (for 
example, investments, insurance, and so on), that arrangement can easily bias 
their recommendations. Financial planners who perform ongoing money 
management have a conflict of interest as well, because anything that takes 
away money for them to manage (for example, paying down debt, buying a 
home or other real estate, and so on) is of less interest to them.
»
» Ask questions before hiring an advisor. Take referrals as leads to check on. 
Never take a referral from anyone as gospel. Do your homework before hiring 
any advisor.
A quality financial planner doesn’t come cheaply, so make sure you want and need 
to hire an advisor before searching for a competent one. If you have a specific tax 
or legal matter, you may be better off hiring a good professional who specializes 
in that specific field rather than hiring a financial planner.
Recognize that you have a lot at stake when you hire a financial advisor. You’re 
placing a lot of trust in his recommendations. The more you know, the better the 
advisor you end up working with, and the fewer services you need to buy.
Finding good financial advisors
So where and how can you find the best financial advisors? Here are three places 
to start searching:
»
» The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Personal 
Financial Specialists: The AICPA (888-777-7077; www.aicpa.org/
ForThePublic/Pages/financial-planning-resources.aspx) is a 
professional association of CPAs. The organization compiles a list of its 
members who have completed its Personal Financial Specialist (PFS) program, 

246      PART 5  Your Information Diet
many of whom provide financial advice on a fee basis. Competent CPAs 
understand the tax consequences of different choices, which are important 
components of any financial plan. On the other hand, keeping current in two 
broad fields can be hard for some professionals.
»
» The National Association of Personal Financial Advisors: The NAPFA (888- 
333-6659; www.napfa.org) consists of fee-only planners. Its members aren’t 
supposed to earn commissions from products they sell or recommend. However, 
most planners in this association earn their living by providing money-­management 
services and charging a fee that’s a percentage of assets under management. Most 
have minimums, which can put them out of reach for some people.
»
» Personal referrals: Getting a personal referral from a satisfied customer you 
trust is one of the best ways to find a good financial planner. Obtaining a 
referral from an accountant or attorney whose judgment you’ve tested can 
help as well. Remember, though, that regardless of who makes the referral, you 
should do your own investigation. Ask the planner the questions I list in the 
next section, “Interviewing advisors.” Remember that the person who makes 
the recommendation is (probably) not a financial expert, and the person may 
simply be returning the favor of business referrals from the financial advisor.
Interviewing advisors
Take your time and fully interview any prospective advisor you may hire with the 
following important questions:
»
» What percentage of your income comes from commissions, hourly client 
fees, and client money-management fees? If you want objective and 
specific financial planning recommendations, give preference to advisors who 
derive their income from hourly fees. Many counselors and advisors call 
themselves fee-based, which usually means that they make their living 
managing money for a percentage. If you want a money manager, you can 
hire the best quite inexpensively through mutual and exchange-traded funds. 
If you have substantial assets, you can hire an established money manager.
Advisors who provide investment advice and manage at least $100 million 
must register with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
(Advisors who manage smaller amounts are often required to register at the 
state level.) You can find out whether the advisor is registered and whether he 
has a track record of problems by calling the SEC at 800-732-0330 or by 
visiting its website at www.adviserinfo.sec.gov. Otherwise, advisors 
generally must register with the state in which they make their principal place 
of business. They must file Form ADV, otherwise known as the Uniform 
Application for Investment Adviser Registration. You can ask the advisor to send 
you a copy of Form ADV, which includes such juicy details as a breakdown of 

CHAPTER 18  Professionals You Hire      247
where the advisor’s income comes from, the advisor’s relationships and 
affiliations with other companies, the advisor’s education and employment 
history, and the advisor’s fee schedule.
»
» What work and educational experience qualify you to be a financial 
planner? A planner should have experience in the business or financial 
services field and should also be good with numbers, speak in plain English, 
and have good interpersonal skills. Common designations of educational 
training among professional money managers are MBA (master of business 
administration) and CFA (chartered financial analyst). Some tax advisors who 
work on an hourly basis have the PFS (personal financial specialist) credential. 
The CFP (certified financial planning) degree is common among those focusing 
their practice on financial planning.
»
» What is your hourly fee? The rates for financial advisors range from as low as 
$75 per hour all the way up to several hundred dollars per hour. If you shop 
around, you can find fine planners who charge around $100 to $150 per hour. 
Focus on the total cost you can expect to pay for the services you’re seeking.
»
» In addition to financial advisory services, what other services do you 
perform (such as tax or legal services)? Tread carefully with someone who 
claims to be an expert beyond one area. The tax, legal, and financial fields are 
vast in and of themselves, and they’re difficult for even the best and brightest 
advisor to cover simultaneously. An exception is the tax advisor/preparer who 
performs basic financial planning by the hour. Likewise, a good financial advisor 
should have a solid grounding in the basic tax and legal issues that relate to your 
personal finances. Large firms may have specialists available in different areas.
»
» Do you carry professional liability insurance? If the advisor doesn’t have 
liability insurance, she has missed one of the fundamental concepts of 
planning: Insure against risk. After all, you want an advisor who carries 
protection in case she makes a major mistake for which she’s liable.
»
» Can you provide references from clients with needs similar to mine? 
Interview others who’ve used the planner. Ask what the planner did for them, 
and find out what the advisor’s strengths and weaknesses are. You can find 
out a bit about the planner’s track record and style.
»
» Will you provide specific strategies and product recommendations that  
I can implement if I choose? This question is crucial because some advisors 
may indicate that you can hire them by the hour but provide only generic 
advice. Ideally, find an advisor who lets you choose whether you want to hire 
her to help implement her recommendations after she presents them. If you 
know you’re going to follow through on the advice and you can do so without 
further discussions and questions, don’t hire the planner to help you imple-
ment her recommendations. On the other hand, if you hire the counselor 
because you lack the time, desire, and/or expertise to manage your financial 
life, building implementation into the planning work makes good sense.

Taming Your Taxes with Help
Taxes are likely one of your biggest expenses. No one enjoys paying so much in 
taxes, complying with seemingly endless tax rules and regulations, and complet-
ing federal- and state-mandated tax returns. So it should come as no surprise that 
an army of tax preparers and advisors is standing ready to help you.
Do you need to use a tax professional? Good tax preparers and advisors can save 
you money by identifying tax-reduction strategies you may overlook. And they 
may reduce the likelihood of your being audited, which can be triggered by mis-
takes. Tax advisors can be of greater use to folks whose financial lives have 
changed significantly (those who are starting a small business, for instance) and 
to people who are unwilling to learn tax strategies to reduce their tax burden.
Tax advisors and preparers come with varying backgrounds, training, and creden-
tials. Here are the three main types, with some info that can help you determine 
which one is right for you:
»
» Preparers: The appeal of preparers, who generally are unlicensed, is that 
they’re comparatively less costly (their rate works out to less than $100 per 
hour) than other tax professionals. Preparers make the most sense for folks 
who have relatively simple financial lives, who are budget-minded, and who 
dislike doing their own taxes.
»
» Enrolled agents: A person must pass IRS licensing requirements to be called 
an enrolled agent (EA), which enables the agent to represent you before the 
IRS. Continuing education is also required; EAs generally go through more 
training than preparers. EAs are best for people who have moderately 
complex returns and don’t necessarily need complicated tax-planning advice 
throughout the year (although some EAs provide this service as well). You can 
find contact information for EAs in your area by calling the National 
Association of Enrolled Agents at 202-822-6232 or visiting its website at  
www.naea.org.
»
» Certified public accountants: CPAs go through significant training and 
examination before receiving the CPA credential. And to maintain the 
designation, CPAs also must complete continuing education classes annually. 
Most CPAs charge $100+ per hour. CPAs at larger firms and in high-cost-of-
living areas tend to charge more. CPAs make the most sense for the self-
employed and/or for folks who file lots of schedules with their tax returns.

CHAPTER 18  Professionals You Hire      249
Working with Real-Estate Agents
When you buy or sell a property such as a condominium, town home, or single 
family home, if you’re like most people, you’ll likely work with a real-estate agent 
who’s paid on commission. Although the best real-estate agents can help you find 
a home that meets your needs, the commission arrangement can create conflicts 
of interest. Because agents get a percentage of your property’s sales price, they 
want you to complete a deal quickly and at the highest price possible. When you’re 
a seller, the agent’s incentives can be good, but when you’re a buyer, they can be 
in conflict with what’s best for you.
Some buyers’ agents say they can better represent your interests as a property 
buyer and will sign a contract with you to represent you as a buyer’s agent. 
However, agents working as buyers’ brokers to represent you still have conflicts 
of interest in that they get paid only when you buy and earn a commission as a 
percentage of the purchase price.
To find a good real-estate agent, begin by interviewing at least three agents. Ask 
the agents for references from at least three clients they worked with in the past 
six months in the geographical area in which you’re looking. Look for agents with 
the following traits:
»
» Local market knowledge: Investigating communities, school systems, 
neighborhoods, and financing options can be a huge undertaking. Good 
agents can help you tap into various information sources as well as share 
their contacts with you.
»
» Full time and experienced: Ask how many years the agent has been working 
full time. The best agents work at their profession full time so they can stay on 
top of everything. Many of the best agents come into the field from other 
occupations, such as business or teaching. Some sales, marketing, negotia-
tion, and communication skills can certainly be picked up in other fields, but 
experience in buying and selling real estate does count.
»
» Honesty and patience: A real-estate purchase or sale is typically a large-
dollar transaction from the perspective of your overall personal finances. So 
you need an agent who always answers your questions truthfully and who 
always goes out of his way to disclose anything that could affect properties 
you’re considering. You also need a patient agent who’s willing to allow you 
the necessary time to get educated and make your best decision.

250      PART 5  Your Information Diet
»
» Negotiation and interpersonal skills: Putting a deal together involves lots of 
negotiation. Ask the agent’s references how well the agent negotiated for 
them. Also, your agent needs to represent your interests and get along with 
other agents, property sellers, inspectors, mortgage lenders, and so on.
»
» High-quality standards: Sloppy work can lead to big legal or logistical 
problems down the road. If an agent neglects to recommend thorough and 
complete inspections, for example, you may be stuck with undiscovered 
problems after the deal.
REDFIN AND DISCOUNT  
REAL-ESTATE BROKERS
For many years, I have watched as numerous real-estate brokers and companies have 
sought to undercut what are seen to be high real-estate-agent commissions. When a 
real-estate agent lists a house for sale, the commission is typically six percent or so of the 
sales price (the commission percentage tends to be a little lower for high-priced homes). 
If the house is sold, that agent who listed the house for sale typically gets half of that 
commission and the other half is paid to the agent who represented the buyer. (Actually, 
each agent must split his commission with the brokerage company he works for.)
Of all the discount real-estate agencies that have been launched over the years, Redfin 
has been the most successful to date but has only captured a small fraction of the hous-
ing transactions in the markets in which it has a presence. Redfin launched its services 
in Seattle in 2006 and has expanded over the years to now operate in dozens of cities 
around the country.
Redfin’s promise was that through the heavy use of technology (online listings and 
video tours), reduced commissions, and salary-based agents, house sellers would save 
money using Redfin and buyers could potentially save time and money too. While the 
firm has a decent overall reputation, the reality of what Redfin now offers shows far 
more similarities with traditional real-estate agencies.
Redfin commissions are indeed a bit less and their agents, who generally work in a team 
approach with clients, are paid a salary. But, when it comes to selling your house, work-
ing with a commission-based agent more potentially aligns your incentive with theirs — 
the more the house sells for, the more everyone makes.
In terms of using technology and the Internet to help sell houses, traditional real-estate 
agencies have largely embraced and matched what Redfin does.

CHAPTER 18  Professionals You Hire      251
Using Online Resources to  
Find Service Providers
Finding quality, affordable professional service providers can be a challenge. As 
can finding the myriad other service providers you may seek, such as an auto 
repair shop or a plumber. All of us have the battle scars from the school of hard 
knocks and making bad hiring decisions.
Getting referrals from folks you know often doesn’t pan out — and for good rea-
son. Just because your friend or neighbor has had good experiences with a given 
contractor doesn’t mean you will or that you value the same things in a provider.
The Internet has long held the promise of being an information source and 
exchange for consumers interested in hearing the straight scoop about service 
providers, but message boards rarely have a critical mass of comments about 
locally focused companies. Firms such as Kudzu, which is owned by media con-
glomerate Cox Enterprises, provides consumers free reviews on companies, but 
here’s a case where you may well get less than you paid for. Anyone can complete 
a simple registration by providing an email address, name, and zip code, and 
many service providers have just one or a few reviews. Due to the anonymity of 
the reviews and lack of screening, company owners, employees, and friends can 
easily post puffed-up reviews while competitors can easily criticize their peers.
After reviewing numerous websites that purport to help consumers separate the 
best service providers from the rest, the sections that follow highlight those that 
I’ve found are doing the best job.
On some ratings sites, companies are solicited to buy enhanced listings, and this 
disguised advertising may make them more appealing to prospective customers. 
For example, Kudzu’s “Enhanced Profile” service promises the paying company 
“Higher placement in search” as well as the ability to add photos and video and a 
marketing description.
Angie’s List
Angie’s List subscribers get access to data and customer feedback on a wide range 
of service providers in their local market area. The service boasts more than  
3 million members in hundreds of markets around the United States.
Angie’s List, which began operations in 1995, uses proprietary technology to pro-
cess reports, and one of a team of thirty people employed by Angie’s List reads 
every report before it gets posted. Reports praising your own business or dissing a 

252      PART 5  Your Information Diet
competitor’s are ferreted out and removed. As happens on eBay, customers and 
businesses can respond to one another. When Angie’s List receives a report on an 
unregistered company, that company is allowed to register for free. By register-
ing, the company can then respond by posting to each customer’s report. Con-
sumers may not report anonymously, but their identity is only disclosed to the 
companies they rate. Angie’s List also offers conflict resolution when a customer 
and company are at odds over their interaction.
Angie’s List says that they have a “zero-tolerance policy” about companies has-
sling a customer over the posting of negative comments. The report is posted live 
for all members to see, which obviously offers an incentive for the service com-
pany to resolve the issue quickly. If the service company resolves the complaint to 
the customer’s satisfaction, the dispute is considered “resolved” and the negative 
report is removed from the service company’s record. That’s the leverage Angie’s 
List uses to get complaints resolved. The member can then choose to file a new 
report, but if they do, they must grade the company at a B or above. However, the 
member is not obligated to file another report.
Co-founder Angie Hicks never really considered the advertising-only model so 
often used online when she started her company. “We offer a premium service 
with high-quality information. Consumers are willing to pay for good informa-
tion. Consumers are looking for trusted filters,” says Hicks.
Angie’s List has not totally forsaken ads. The company offers coupons from highly 
rated service companies. Companies pay to run coupons and must have an A or B 
rating. Like a school report card, grades range from A (best) to F (worst). If a 
company has any unresolved complaints, it can’t advertise, regardless of its 
overall grade.
(Note: At the time that this book goes to press in late 2017, Angie’s List may merge 
into the parent company that owns HomeAdvisor [see the next section].)
HomeAdvisor
HomeAdvisor (formerly Service Magic), another large online provider of service-
company referrals, is the best firm I reviewed that doesn’t rely on member sub-
scriptions. With HomeAdvisor, you register for free and provide personal 
information, including your home address and details of what you’re looking for, 
and several companies, which have paid HomeAdvisor an annual membership 
(advertising) fee of about $300, will contact you offering their services. Home- 
Advisor argues that such fees weed out people who may be operating as a sideline 
or on a short-term basis and lead to higher-quality, committed contractors being 
listed on their site.

CHAPTER 18  Professionals You Hire      253
HomeAdvisor, which is focused on home improvement, repair, and maintenance 
firms, also has a ratings and review feature where customers can rate the com-
pany. To prevent bogus reviews, HomeAdvisor only allows consumers who have 
found contractors through their service to rate and evaluate those contractors.
Here’s how their service works: Suppose you’re seeking a contractor to build you 
a wooden deck. After completing background information on the HomeAdvisor 
site about your planned project, your information would be sent to three contrac-
tors in your area who would contact you, arrange a meeting to discuss your proj-
ect, and give you a proposal (with some contractors, you can actually schedule 
these appointments through the HomeAdvisor site).
Unlike other services, including Angie’s List, HomeAdvisor screens all contrac-
tors, who must meet numerous criteria including being properly licensed within 
their state, carrying general liability insurance coverage, and passing a criminal 
and financial background check (which uncovers negatives such as liens, bank-
ruptcies, and judgments), among other items.
In addition to paying HomeAdvisor an annual membership fee of $300, contrac-
tors pay HomeAdvisor a lead fee, depending upon the type of work and ranging 
from $10 to $50, for each lead they are sent. HomeAdvisor’s model allows con-
tractors to target clients by zip code and task, which allows them to be more 
focused in their prospecting and spend less time driving long distances.
Other resources
Another resource worth checking out is Consumers Checkbook (www.checkbook.org),  
which compiles service-provider data in the following metro areas: Boston, Chicago, 
Delaware Valley (Philadelphia area), Puget Sound (Seattle area), San Francisco/
Oakland/San Jose, Twin Cities, and Washington, D.C.  Checkbook is a nonprofit 
founded in 1974. Like Consumer Reports, it doesn’t accept any advertising or money 
from companies it reviews. In addition to its website, it publishes Consumer’s 
Checkbook magazine in seven local versions for each of the metro areas.
Another option for checking out service providers is to access the Better Business 
Bureau (BBB) website in your area, which you can locate through their national 
site (www.bbb.org). BBB information, which is available without a fee to you the 
consumer, may tell you if the company you’re considering has any recent black 
marks but will hardly give you a thorough review of many customers’ experiences 
like those you will find on sites like HomeAdvisor or Angie’s List. BBBs are non-
profits that collect fees from member companies. Thus, they have similar conflicts 
of interest that Angie’s List and Home Advisor have in being “pro” business.

Ten Ways to Save on a Car
I
 remember my first car and appreciate the flexibility and joy that having that 
car provided me. My first car was a generously sized Ford LTD that was a hand- 
me-down. No longer able to drive, my elderly grandfather had given the car to 
my parents. After a couple years of additional use, my folks then passed the car 
along to me when I got my first job and was working in Boston. I didn’t have much 
free time or need to use the car during the workweek, but I was grateful to have it 
for weekend trips.
In some respects, it was an ideal first car because it was solid and reliable but not 
overly valuable. It probably didn’t get great gas mileage, but I appreciated its 
safety when a car (a compact) rear-ended my car and barely left a scratch (although 
the front end of the bad driver’s car was totaled).
In this chapter, I highlight some tips and strategies for making the most of your 
car-driving experiences and doing so in a financially prudent fashion. For more 
information on other transportation options to help you save money, check out 
Chapter 5.
Don’t Buy a Car in the First Place
My first experience owning a car taught me an important lesson: Car ownership is 
costly. As a result, I suggest that if you don’t need a car, don’t buy one  — 
particularly if you live in a city with reliable public transportation or you rarely 

258      PART 6  The Part of Tens
need a car. Use the subway or bus and save your money. As with renting a home or 
apartment instead of buying and owning one, sometimes in your life you may be 
able to do without your own car, and other times you’ll feel that having a car is 100 
percent necessary. Enjoy the times when you can do without a car because you 
may save a good deal of money and hassle.
Owning a car requires multiple expenses that can really drain your wallet. In addi-
tion to insurance and gas, in my experience with my first car, I faced a seemingly 
never-ending list of maintenance and repairs, and that list only grew worse the 
longer I had the car. And having a car in a big city can be a hassle — I had to pay 
parking tickets from parking my car on the Boston streets and had to deal with not 
always being available to move the car on designated street-sweeping days. Add 
the expense of having to pay out of pocket for damages likely caused by a city 
snowplow that didn’t own up to the accident.
When I moved from Boston and over the subsequent decade, many years I chose 
not to own a car. I was able to do this because I lived either in a city with decent 
public transit options or in the suburbs close to everything I needed and could 
manage well with a bike (in a nice year-round climate!). During those years when 
I didn’t have a car, I would rent one on occasion, and that worked out well and was 
far more economical than owning my own car.
Pay Cash: Shun Leasing and Borrowing
When you do decide to get your own car, do your best to save in advance and pay 
for the car with your cash savings. For many folks starting out, doing so means 
setting their sights on a good-quality used car.
Taking out a loan to buy a car or leasing a car are generally much-more-expensive 
ways to get a car because of the interest you pay (in the case of a loan) or the 
higher rates (in the case of leasing). Car dealers who are in the business of leasing 
or originating car loans will, of course, have a different agenda and push these 
methods because they profit from them. Don’t be fooled by zero percent interest 
loans, either — dealers will sock you with a higher car price to make up for such 
low-cost financing.

CHAPTER 19  Ten Ways to Save on a Car      259
Consider Total Costs
When you compare makes and models of cars, be sure to consider more than the 
sticker price. Among other cost considerations are fuel, maintenance, repairs, 
insurance, and how rapidly the car depreciates in value.
Among the best independent sources that I’ve found for such information are 
www.edmunds.com and www.motortrend.com/intellichoice.
Compare New with Used
Because a new car depreciates most rapidly in value in the first couple of years, 
buying a car that’s at least a year or two old usually provides you with a better 
value for your money than buying a new car.
Don’t assume, however, that buying a used car is always a better value. For exam-
ple, during a severe recession such as the one the United States experienced in 
2008–2009, new cars made comparatively better sense than many used cars. The 
reason for this was a matter of simple economics and supply and demand. More 
people opted for buying a used car. Fewer folks put theirs on the market, holding 
off on buying a new one until the economy got better. These two forces squeezed 
used-car supply and increased used-car prices. At the same time, fewer consum-
ers were buying new cars, forcing dealers to slash new-car prices.
Understand a Car’s Real Value  
Before Negotiating
After you home in on what make and model of car you want, make sure you arm 
yourself with the essential information as you shop around. For new cars, you 
should know (and can easily find out) what the dealer’s cost is for each vehicle. 
You can find this information at Consumer Reports (www.consumerreports.org) as 
well as the sources I mention in the next paragraph.
For used cars, a number of sources can assist you with quickly valuing a vehicle 
based on its condition, features, and mileage. Among the best sources for used-
car valuation information are Kelley Blue Book (www.kbb.com) and Edmunds  
(www.edmunds.com).

260      PART 6  The Part of Tens
Take Care of Your Car
Besides the obvious financial benefit from staying on top of your car’s servicing 
requirements (getting your oil changed regularly, rotating and properly inflating 
your tires, and so on), you also reap safety benefits as well. That’s why you should 
be proactive about your car’s maintenance. (See Chapter 16 for more ideas.)
Of course, not everyone is. I was astonished to see a car with nearly completely 
bald tires at the local garage that services my car. I subsequently learned that the 
woman refused to replace her tires because she “couldn’t afford” to do so. (Never 
mind that she was driving a more costly car than I was!) Clearly, she could afford 
to do so, but for whatever odd reason (more than likely ignorance about the dan-
ger), she wasn’t spending her money on new tires. By driving on such old tires, 
she was causing other problems to her car and, of course, risking a serious acci-
dent, which would lead to a large bill and possible injury (or worse) to her and 
others.
Explore Your Servicing Options
Finding a good auto mechanic — someone who’s competent and honest — is no 
small feat! You’re not likely an expert in the various components and operating 
systems of your car, so you’re largely at the mercy of the mechanic telling you that 
you supposedly need to have something addressed on your car.
The primary advantage of taking your car to an authorized dealer (such as taking 
your Honda to a Honda dealer) is that the dealer has the proper equipment and 
technology to test and service your car. The downside to dealers is that they may 
have higher prices and may push doing packages of significant work at major 
mileage milestones (for example, 30,000 miles, 60,000 miles, and so on) that may 
not need to be done.
Numerous local garages can do the work, and the primary advantage with those 
can be convenience (choosing one near your home or office) and possibly lower 
rates. However, an unscrupulous mechanic may push doing work that doesn’t 
need to be done, and you also need to be on the lookout for competence issues, as 
an independent mechanic may not be able to service the full range of problems on 
your car’s make and model.

CHAPTER 19  Ten Ways to Save on a Car      261
Drive Safely
Driving faster than 60 miles per hour (70 mph for some car models), accelerating 
too fast, and having to jam on the brakes wastes gas and adds to the wear and tear 
on your car over time (and therefore is costly). And what about the people travel-
ing with you? Driving is probably the most dangerous thing you do on a regular 
basis, so it’s not just about your money but also the health and safety of you, your 
friends, and your family who take trips in your car. See Chapter 16 for details on 
safe driving and safe cars.
Take a Lean and Mean Insurance Policy
Most states mandate minimum levels of auto insurance. In my experience as a 
financial counselor reviewing folks’ insurance policies, including their auto insur-
ance, people often have the wrong types of coverage — missing things they really 
need while wasting money on other things they don’t need. Be sure to review my 
auto insurance recommendations in Chapter 16.
Track Tax-Deductible Auto Expenses
You may be able to deduct certain auto expenses related to the use of your car for 
your job, especially if you’re self-employed. Be aware, however, that your expenses 
for commuting in your car between your home and office aren’t deductible.
You can deduct your out-of-pocket expenses (such as gas and oil) that are directly 
related to the use of your car in charitable work. You can’t deduct anything like 
general repair or maintenance expenses, tires, insurance, depreciation, and so on. 
If you don’t want to track and deduct your actual expenses, the IRS allows you to 
use a standard rate per mile to figure your contribution. You can deduct actual 
expenses for parking fees and tolls. If you must travel away from home to perform 
a real and substantial service, such as attending a convention for a qualified chari-
table organization, you can claim a deduction for your unreimbursed travel and 
transportation expenses, including meals and lodging. Such deductions are only 
allowed if your travel involves no significant amount of personal pleasure.

Ten Things to Value 
More Than Your Money
T
hroughout this book, I provide information and advice that can help you 
make the most of your money. Whether you’ve stuck with me since Chapter 1 
or simply skimmed a few chapters, you probably know that I take a holistic 
approach to money decisions.
Although I hope my financial advice serves you well, I also want to be sure that 
you remember the many things in life that are far more important than the girth 
of your investment portfolio or the size of your latest paycheck. I hope this chapter 
of ten things more valuable than money makes a small contribution to keeping 
you on the best overall path.
Investing in Your Health
People neglect their health for different reasons. In some cases, as with money 
management, people simply don’t know the keys to good personal health. Getting 
too caught up in one’s career and working endless hours also often lead to neglect 
of one’s health.

264      PART 6  The Part of Tens
Plenty of people suffer from ongoing conditions that damage their body and make 
them feel worse than need be. Stress, poor diet, lack of exercise, problematic 
relationships  — all these bad habits can harm your health. You only get one 
body — take care of it and treat it with the respect it deserves!
Staying active and at a healthy weight
Over the years, I have generally been active, but I got lazier as I got older. Over 
time, I became less active. And my diet wasn’t nearly as good as it could be.
I finally got motivated to eat healthier, be more active, and lose weight. I lost 
35 pounds over six months and feel and look much better. I weigh now what I did 
when I was in my 20s! And, I have more energy.
How did I do it? I did some reading and made the following changes:
»
» Hydrating much more: I always have a large glass of herbal tea nearby, and 
I find I eat less when I’m better hydrated. Some claim that certain herbal teas 
speed up your metabolism; I have no proof of that, but maybe I’m getting that 
benefit too!
»
» Exercising more: I did find that using a fitness tracker (see the next section) 
helped me to be accountable and know how active I really was. I also lift 
weights regularly, which I had done in the past but do more often now.
»
» Eating healthier: Over the years, I have done various reading about food and 
nutrition, a field in which thinking and recommendations continue to evolve. 
I must confess that I found Dr. Mark Hyman’s advice to make a lot of sense, 
and it has worked for me. By eating foods with plenty of good fats and 
protein, combined with lots of vegetables and Greek yogurt daily, I eat less 
and feel full longer.
Using fitness trackers to monitor  
your activity level
With the proliferation of cellphones, few people, especially younger people, wear 
a wristwatch anymore. But now, more and more people are wearing something 
that looks like a watch on their wrist but is in fact a fitness tracker first and a 
watch second. The simplest ones cost less than $100 and track how much activity 
(for example, number of steps) you engage in every day.

CHAPTER 20  Ten Things to Value More Than Your Money      265
More sophisticated trackers that typically cost about $100 to $150 can track your 
heart rate throughout the day as well as your resting heart rate, track many dif-
ferent kinds of exercise, track your sleeping patterns, and even include a GPS 
device that may be of use, for example, to runners or bikers who want more pre-
cise analysis of their exercise patterns and routes.
I recently reviewed a number of the better trackers on the market and was pleas-
antly surprised and impressed with what they can do. I didn’t fully know exactly 
how active I was on a daily basis before I tried these trackers, but I did know that, 
like too many of my middle-age peers, I had gradually put on more weight over 
time and was finally motivated to do something about it.
I enoyed using the two trackers I tried from FitBit and TomTom. They tracked my 
steps throughout the day and logged specific activities such as when I went for a 
walk, played a racquet sport at the gym, used my rowing machine, and so on. 
Their online applications, which you can access through the Internet on a com-
puter or through an app on your cellphone, enable you to edit and enter what each 
specific activity was if the tracker hasn’t already correctly identified it. The devices 
also track your heart rate, measure your resting heart rate, and can track your 
daily sleep patterns.
Just as monitoring your spending and saving can motivate some folks to spend 
less and save more, I found that tracking my activity definitely encouraged me to 
be more active and helped with my desired weight loss.
Before buying a fitness tracker, examine the features on each device you’re con-
sidering and do your best to determine what you really want. It’s not worth paying 
for certain features, like GPS tracking, if you’re unlikely to use them. Also, be sure 
to read customer reviews of the devices you’re considering to understand what 
others like and don’t like about it.
Making and Keeping Friends
So many items in this consumer-oriented society are disposable, and unfortu-
nately, friends too often fall into that category. These days, it seems like friends 
aren’t really friends as much as they are acquaintances who can further people’s 
careers, and after that function has passed, they’re cast aside.
Ask yourself who your true friends are. Do you have friends you can turn to in a 
time of need who can really listen and be there for you? Take the time to invest in 
your friendships, both old and new.

266      PART 6  The Part of Tens
Appreciating What You Have
In my work as a financial counselor and writer, I’ve had the opportunity to inter-
act with many people from all walks of life. Rich or poor, invariably people focus 
on what they don’t have instead of appreciating the material and nonmaterial 
things they do have.
Make a list of at least ten things that you appreciate. Periodically (weekly or 
monthly) make another list. This exercise helps you focus on what you have 
instead of dwelling on what you don’t.
Minding Your Reputation
One of my professors once said, “It can take a lifetime to build a reputation but 
only moments to lose it.” As people chase after more fame, power, money, and 
possessions, they often devalue and underinvest in relationships and commit ille-
gal and immoral acts along the way. Your reputation is one of the most important 
things you have, so don’t do anything to taint it.
Think of the people you most admire in your life. Although I’m sure that none of 
them is perfect, I bet each has a superior reputation in your eyes.
Continuing Education
Education is a lifelong process — it’s not just about attending a pricey college and 
perhaps getting an advanced degree. You always have something to discover, 
whether it’s related to your career or a new hobby. Look for opportunities to mas-
ter new lessons each and every day. And who knows, maybe someday you’ll gain 
an understanding of the meaning of life. The older people get, the more they have 
to reflect upon and benefit from.
Having Fun
In the quest to earn and save more, some people get caught up in society’s money 
game, and money becomes the purpose of their existence. They lose sight of what 
life is really about. Whether you call it an addiction or an obsession, having such a 

CHAPTER 20  Ten Things to Value More Than Your Money      267
financial focus steers you from life’s good things. I’ve known plenty of people who 
realize too late in life that sacrificing personal relationships and one’s health isn’t 
worth any amount of financial success.
Therapists’ offices are filled with unhappy people who spend too much time and 
energy chasing elusive career goals and money. These same people come to me for 
financial counseling and worry about having enough money. When I tell them that 
they have “enough,” the conversation usually turns to the personal things lacking 
in their life. Remember to keep your perspective and live each day to the fullest.
Putting Your Family First
Some employees rightfully fear that their boss may not be sympathetic to their 
family’s needs, especially when those needs get in the way of getting the job done 
as efficiently as an impatient boss would like. Others put their company first 
because that’s what peers do and because they don’t want to rock the boat.
Your spouse, your parents, and your kids, of course, should come first. They’re 
more important than your next promotion, so treat them that way. Balance is key; 
your actions speak louder than promises and words. Should your boss not respect 
or value the importance of family, then perhaps it’s time to find a new boss.
Knowing Your Neighbors
Your neighbors can be sources of friendship, happiness, and comfort. I often see 
people caught up in their routine who neglect their neighbors. You live by these 
people and probably see them on a semiregular basis. Take the time to get to know 
them.
You may not want to get to know all your neighbors better, but give them a chance. 
Don’t write them off because they aren’t the same age or race, or don’t have the 
same occupation as you. Part of your coherence with greater society comes from 
where you live, and your neighbors are an important piece of that connection.

268      PART 6  The Part of Tens
Volunteering and Donating
Although the United States has one of the world’s highest per-capita incomes, by 
other, more important measures, the country has room for improvement. Society 
has some significant problems, such as a relatively high rate of poverty, gun vio-
lence, divorce, and suicide.
You can find plenty of causes worthy of your volunteer time or donations. Check 
out www.volunteermatch.org to discover volunteer opportunities. If you want to 
donate something as a thank-you to members of the military, visit the National 
Military Family Association at www.militaryfamily.org. (Military folks can use 
this site to find out about a wide range of benefits.)
Caring for Kids
The children in society are tomorrow’s future. You should care about children 
even if you don’t have any. Why? Do you care about the quality of society? Do you 
have any concerns about crime? Do you care about the economy? What about your 
Social Security and Medicare benefits? All these issues depend to a large extent on 
the nation’s children and what kind of teenagers and adults they someday become.
Investing in your children and other children is absolutely one of the best invest-
ments you can make. Understanding how to relate to and care for kids can help 
make you a better and more fulfilled person. (And I think that understanding kids 
can help you better understand what makes grown-ups tick, too!)

Nearly Ten Things to 
Know About Apps
A
t the risk of starting with the very basics, apps are to smartphones what 
software is to personal computers. As we spend more time on smart-
phones, more programs — known as apps — are being developed to run 
on our phones.
Most apps are offered by large companies as another option for their customers to 
be in touch with and interact with what they offer. The financial institutions that 
you do business with — banks, mutual fund companies, brokerage firms, and so 
on — are a common example.
In this chapter, I provide advice for how to make the most out of apps and sidestep 
common app pitfalls and problems, and I highlight the best financial apps that 
I have reviewed.

270      PART 6  The Part of Tens
You May Well Get What You  
Paid for with “Free” Apps
Though they haven’t gotten the attention that computer viruses, computer mal-
ware, and computer ransomware attacks have garnered, similar problems have 
arisen with smartphone apps. The worst of the lot can end up tracking and spying 
on you. Some are a scam and/or some sort of virus or malware.
In addition to those issues, you should also check out the background and agenda 
of any company offering a financial app and how it may be making money from 
the app. Most apps are nothing more than glorified advertising from the company 
behind the app. Sure, they may dangle something seemingly helpful (for example, 
offering a free credit score, stock quotes, and so on), but ultimately you should 
uncover what their agenda and reputation is. Many free credit score apps, for 
example, make money from affiliate fees from credit cards they pitch you.
Do your homework and research an app before downloading and beginning to use 
it. Check with more than one independent source and read independent reviews, 
especially those that are critical and less than flattering. And stay far far away 
from the many apps that claim they can show you how to make big bucks doing 
very little from the comfort of your own home.
Conduct and Manage Financial Tasks
You can use apps to do more and more tasks that previously needed to be done 
online and through a regular computer. The dizzying pace of technological change 
continues as many smartphones function as mini-computers in your hand.
The best apps can help you perform common financial tasks such as
»
» Getting better value when shopping for a specific product or service
»
» Tracking where you’re spending money weekly and monthly
»
» Checking your banking account balance
»
» Doing basic investment research
Although some apps are provided free of charge by companies that are seeking to 
promote their own services, others charge modest fees (like a software company 
does) because the app is all they are selling.

CHAPTER 21  Nearly Ten Things to Know About Apps      271
Use Apps Only from Legitimate Companies 
with Lengthy Track Records
You will notice that most of the companies recommended in this chapter are fairly 
large companies with lengthy track records of success. For sure, technology is 
disrupting and changing many industries and companies. But, that doesn’t mean 
that you should only do business with firms that exist solely online, in the cloud, 
and so on.
Research the history of companies that you are considering doing business with. 
When seeking the link for a mobile app, get that link and download the app from 
the company’s website so you’re sure you are getting their actual app rather than 
a knock-off or a fraudulent one.
Consider the Alternatives to an App
Before downloading and using an app, you should question the need for it and 
consider the alternatives. Remember that the company behind the app wants to tie 
you to it so you’ll buy more and spend more with them. Is that your goal?
You likely have your phone with you all the time. Do you really want this app 
running and in your face all the time? Maybe, maybe not — think about it and 
examine the alternatives.
Keep Focused on Your Spending
Some folks need and want extra help and hand-holding when it comes to licking 
the problem of overspending or simply feeling on top of where their money goes 
and doing something constructive about it. As I detail in Chapter 17, many web-
sites and related apps purport to address this problem but in reality have massive 
conflicts of interest through the kickbacks (affiliate relationships) they have with 
companies that they direct business to. Advertising is also a common problem.
There are some apps that to date have overcome these problems, but things can 
change, so don’t take my current recommendation in this space as a forever 
endorsement. That said, I like the Goodbudget app for its simplicity and practical-
ity. The basic version provides you with up to one year of expense-tracking his-
tory in ten main categories (envelopes). There is also a paid or premium version 

272      PART 6  The Part of Tens
($45 per year), which provides up to five years of expense tracking with unlimited 
categories as well as email support. I suggest starting with the free version and 
then deciding in the future whether an upgrade is worth your while.
Also, I’m not a fan of apps that have you store your credit-card information in the 
app (for example, games, iTunes, and so on) so you can automatically charge pur-
chases. For some folks, this can quickly lead to overspending.
Settle up with Friends but Beware Fees
Going out with friends or doing other activities often involves spending money. So 
long as you can afford these outings and you’re hitting your savings targets and 
goals, great! Regardless, though, make sure everyone is paying her share. Some-
times you may have to cover for someone who is low on cash or left his wallet at 
home. Other times, one of your friends can help you out. Apps like Venmo, Square 
Cash, Gmail/Google Wallet, and PayPal can help you get paid and allow you to pay 
others to whom you may owe money.
Pay close attention to possible fees, especially when using a credit card. Venmo, 
for example, hits you with a 2.9 percent fee on credit-card transactions but doesn’t 
charge a fee for other transactions, including usage of debit cards. PayPal has no 
fees on direct money transfers but does charge for debit and credit-card 
transactions.
Save Money on Commonly 
Purchased Items
Some apps are simply designed to save you money. GasBuddy, for example, will 
show you the price for gasoline at various service stations in a local area  
(see Figure 21-1). It’s free for consumers to use.
Especially when going on lengthy car trips, car tolls can add up quickly. Tollsmart 
Toll Calculator is a low-cost app that enables you to compare toll costs for alter-
native routes. The Waze app can help with navigating traffic. Somebody should 
really combine a navigation app with the information from a toll app so that driv-
ers can select routes that save time and money!

CHAPTER 21  Nearly Ten Things to Know About Apps      273
CamelCamelCamel is a price tracker that scans items on Amazon, shows you their 
price history, and sends you alerts when a product you’re interested in drops in 
price. PriceGrabber scans items everywhere online, although its website is much 
easier to use than its app.
Tap Into the Latest Economic  
and Financial Data
The St. Louis Fed’s signature economic database — FRED, which stands for Fed-
eral Reserve Economic Database — is accessible through an app (see Figure 21-2). 
Here’s a rare case where you can have a wealth of data on the economy and finan-
cial markets at your fingertips and never be bombarded with ads or plugs to buy 
things.

Invest With Confidence
Of course, many banks, investment companies, brokers, and so on have apps. So 
if you have a favorite investment firm or bank, check out what it offers. For its 
broad array of cost-effective funds with solid long-term performance, I use Van-
guard’s app.
Just because you have an app that gives you 24/7 access to your accounts and 
financial market data doesn’t mean you should obsessively follow these things. 
Doing so will likely make you a worse investor.

Investing in Funds: 
Mutual Funds and 
Exchange-Traded Funds
T
his chapter is all about investing through funds  — mutual funds and 
exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Mutual funds are simply pools of money 
from investors that a mutual fund manager uses to buy a bunch of stocks, 
bonds, and other assets that meet the fund’s investment criteria.
The best ETFs are quite similar to mutual funds  — specifically, index mutual 
funds. Such ETFs generally track a major market index. (Some ETFs, however, 
track narrowly focused indexes, such as an industry group or small country.) The 
most significant difference between a mutual fund and an ETF is that to invest in 
an EFT, you must buy it through a stock exchange where the ETF trades, just as 
individual stocks trade.
Different types of funds can help you meet various financial goals. You can use 
money market funds for something most everybody needs: an emergency savings 
stash of three to six months’ living expenses. Or perhaps you’re thinking about 
saving for a home purchase, retirement, or future educational costs. If so, you can 
consider some stock and bond funds.

278      Investing in Your 20s & 30s For Dummies
Because efficient funds take most of the hassle and cost out of deciding which 
companies to invest in, they’re among the finest investment vehicles available 
today. Also, funds enable you to have some of the world’s best money managers 
direct the investment of your money.
In this chapter, I discuss how to match funds to your investing objectives and 
assemble a portfolio of superior funds. I also cover alternatives to funds.
Understanding the Advantages of Funds
The best funds are superior investment vehicles for people of all economic means, 
and they can help you accomplish many financial objectives. The following list 
highlights the main reasons for investing in funds rather than in individual 
securities.
»
» Low cost: When you invest your money in an efficiently managed fund, it 
should cost you less than trading individual securities on your own. Fund 
managers can buy and sell securities for a fraction of the cost that you pay. 
Funds also spread the cost of research over many, many investors. The most 
efficiently managed mutual funds cost less than 1 percent per year in fees. 
(Bonds and money market funds cost much less — in the neighborhood of 0.5 
percent per year or less.) Some of the larger and more established funds can 
charge annual fees less than 0.2 percent per year; that’s less than a $2 annual 
charge per $1,000 you invest.
»
» Diversification: Funds generally invest in dozens of securities. Diversification 
is a big attraction for many investors who choose funds because proper 
diversification increases the chance that the fund will earn higher returns with 
less risk. Most funds own stocks or bonds in dozens of companies, thus 
diversifying against the risk of problems from any single company or sector. 
Achieving such diversification on your own is difficult and expensive unless 
you have a few hundred thousand dollars and a great deal of time to invest.
»
» Professional management: Fund investment companies hire a portfolio 
manager and researchers whose full-time jobs are to analyze and purchase 
suitable investments for the fund. These people screen the universe of 
investments for those that meet the fund’s stated objectives. Fund managers 
are typically graduates of the top business and finance schools, where they 
learned portfolio management, securities valuation, and securities selection. 
Many have additional investing credentials, such as Chartered Financial 
Analyst (CFA) certification. The best fund managers also typically possess 
more than ten years’ experience analyzing and selecting investments.

BONUS CHAPTER  Investing in Funds: Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds      279
For fund managers and researchers, finding the best investments is a full-time 
job. They do major analysis that you lack the time or expertise to perform. Their 
activities include assessing companies’ financial statements; interviewing company 
managers to hear the companies’ business strategies and vision; examining 
competitors’ strategies; speaking with companies’ customers, suppliers, and 
industry consultants; attending trade shows; and reading industry periodicals.
»
» Achievable investment minimums: Many mutual funds have minimums of 
$1,000 or less. Retirement-account investors can often invest with even less. 
Some funds even offer monthly investment plans so you can start with as little 
as $50 per month. ETFs are even better in this department because there are 
no minimums, although you need to weigh the brokerage costs of buying and 
selling ETF shares. (Some fund companies do offer their own and certain 
other companies’ ETFs free of brokerage fees.)
»
» Funds to fit varying needs: You can select funds that match the ratio of risk 
to reward you need to meet your financial goals. If you want your money to 
grow over a long period, and if you can handle down as well as up years, 
choose stock-focused funds. If you seek current income and don’t want 
investments that fluctuate as widely in value as stocks do, consider some 
bond funds. If you want to be sure that your invested principal doesn’t decline 
in value because you may need to use your money in the short term, select a 
money market fund. Most investors choose a combination of these types of 
funds to diversify and to accomplish different financial goals.
»
» High financial safety: Fund companies can’t fail because the value of fund 
shares fluctuates as the securities in the fund rise and fall in value. For every 
dollar of securities that they hold for their customers, mutual funds and ETFs 
have a dollar’s worth of securities. The worst that can happen with a fund is 
that if you want your money, you may get less money than you originally put 
into the fund due to a market value decline of the fund’s holdings — but you 
won’t lose all your original investment. For added security, the specific stocks, 
bonds, and other securities that a mutual fund buys are held by a custodian, a 
separate organization independent of the mutual fund company. A custodian 
ensures that the fund management company can’t abscond with your funds.
»
» Accessibility: Funds are set up for people who value their time and don’t like 
going to a local branch office and standing in long lines. You can fill out a 
simple form (often online, if you want) and write a check in the comfort of 
your home (or authorize electronic transfers from your bank or other 
accounts) to make your initial investment. Then you typically can make 
subsequent investments by sending money electronically or other convenient 
methods. Many fund companies and investment brokerage firms also allow 
you to transfer money electronically back and forth from your bank account. 
Selling shares of your mutual fund usually is simple, too. Generally, all you 
need to do is call the fund company’s toll-free number, visit its website, or use 
its app to make the arrangements.

Maximizing Your Chances for 
Fund Investing Success
I recommend using some straightforward, common-sense, easy-to-use criteria 
when selecting funds to greatly increase your chances of fund investing success. 
The criteria presented in this section have proven to dramatically increase your 
fund investing returns. (My website, www.erictyson.com, has details on research 
and studies that validate these criteria.)
Understanding the importance  
of performance and risk
A common and often costly mistake that many investors make when they select a 
fund is overemphasizing the importance of past performance. The shorter the 
time period you analyze, the greater the danger that you’ll misuse high past per-
formance as an indicator for a fund’s likely future performance.
High past returns for a fund, relative to its peers, are largely possible only if a fund 
takes more risk or if a fund manager’s particular investment style happens by luck 
to come into favor for a few years. The danger of a fund’s taking greater risk in the 
pursuit of market-beating and peer-beating returns is that it doesn’t always work 
the way you hope. The odds are great that you won’t be able to pick the next star 
before it vaults to prominence in the fund universe. You’re more likely to jump 
into a recently high-performing fund and then be along for the ride when it plum-
mets back to reality.
Some funds make themselves look better by comparing themselves with funds 
that aren’t really comparable. The most common ploy starts with a manager 
investing in riskier types of securities; then the fund company, in its marketing, 
compares its fund’s performance with that of fund companies that invest in less-
risky securities. Always examine the types of securities that a fund invests in and 
then make sure the comparison funds or indexes invest in similar securities.
A fund’s historic rate of return or performance is one of several important factors 
to examine when you select funds. Keep in mind that — as all fund materials must 
tell you — past performance is no guarantee of future results. In fact, many for-
mer high-return funds achieved their results only by taking on high risk or simply 
by relying on short-term luck. Funds that assume higher risk should produce 
higher rates of return, but high-risk funds usually decline in price faster during 
market declines.

BONUS CHAPTER  Investing in Funds: Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds      281
Examining fund management experience
Although the individual fund manager is important, a manager isn’t an island 
unto himself. The resources and capabilities of the parent company are equally, if 
not more, important. Managers come and go, but fund companies usually don’t.
Different companies maintain different capabilities and levels of expertise with 
different types of funds. A fund company gains more or less experience than oth-
ers not only from the direct management of certain fund types, but also through 
hiring out. Some fund families contract with private money management firms 
that possess significant experience. In other cases, private money management 
firms with long histories in private money management — such as Dodge & Cox 
and Primecap Management — offer funds to the general public.
Keeping costs down
The charges that you pay to buy or sell a fund, as well as the ongoing fund operat-
ing expenses, have a major effect on the return that you ultimately earn on your 
fund investments. Given the enormous number of choices available for a particu-
lar type of fund, there’s no reason to pay high costs.
Fund costs are an important factor in the return that you ultimately earn from a 
fund because fees are deducted from your investment returns. High fees and other 
charges depress your returns. Here’s what I recommend you do regarding fees:
»
» Minimize operating expenses. All funds charge fees as long as you keep your 
money in the fund. The fees pay for the costs of running a fund, such as 
employees’ salaries, marketing, toll-free phone lines, and writing and publishing 
prospectuses (the legal disclosure of the fund’s operations and fees). A fund’s 
operating expenses are invisible to you because they’re deducted from the 
fund’s share price on a daily basis. Funds with higher operating expenses tend 
to produce lower rates of return on average. Conversely, funds with lower 
operating costs can more easily produce higher returns for you than compa-
rable types of funds with high costs. This effect makes sense because compa-
nies deduct operating expenses from the returns that your fund generates.
Fund companies quote a fund’s operating expenses as a percentage of your 
investment. The percentage represents an annual fee or charge. You can find 
this number in the fund expense section of a fund’s prospectus, usually on a 
line that says “Total Fund Operating Expense.” You also can call the fund’s 
toll-free phone number and ask a representative, or you can find the informa-
tion at the fund company’s website. Make sure a fund doesn’t have lower 
expenses simply because it’s waiving them temporarily. (You can ask the fund 
representative or look at the fees in the fund’s prospectus to find this 
information.)

282      Investing in Your 20s & 30s For Dummies
»
» Use no-load funds. A sales load is a commission paid to brokers and financial 
planners who work on commission and sell loaded mutual funds. 
Commissions, or loads, generally are about 5 percent of the amount you 
invest. Sales loads are additional and unnecessary costs that are deducted 
from your investment money. You can find plenty of outstanding no-load 
(commission-free) funds. I recommend a few later in this chapter.
Invest in funds that have low total operating expenses and that don’t charge sales 
loads. Both types of fees come out of your pocket and reduce your rate of return. 
Plenty of excellent funds are available at reasonable annual operating-expense 
ratios (less than 1 percent for stock funds and less than 0.5 percent for bond 
funds). See my recommendations of specific funds later in this chapter.
Note: Many of the Vanguard funds recommended in this chapter offer Admiral 
versions that have even lower operating fees for customers who invest at least 
$50,000, or $10,000 for an index or tax managed fund that offers Admiral shares. 
Some of Vanguard’s sector-focused Admiral funds have a $100,000 minimum.
Understanding and using index funds
In some funds, the portfolio manager and a team of analysts scour the market for 
the best securities. These funds are generally known as actively managed funds. An 
index fund, however, simply invests to match the makeup  — and, thus, the 
performance — of an index such as the Standard & Poor’s 500 index of 500 large 
U.S.-company stocks. Index funds, also known as passively managed funds, operate 
with far lower operating expenses because ongoing research isn’t needed to 
identify companies in which to invest.
Index funds deliver relatively solid returns by keeping expenses low, staying 
invested, and not changing investments (unless changes occur to the securities in 
the underlying index). With actively managed stock funds, a fund manager can 
make costly mistakes, such as not being invested when the market goes up, being 
too aggressive when the market plummets, or just being in the wrong stocks. An 
actively managed fund can easily underperform the overall market index that it’s 
competing against. Over ten years or more, index funds typically outperform 
about three-quarters of their peers. Most so-called actively managed funds can’t 
overcome the handicap of high operating expenses that pull down their rates of 
return.
In addition to lower operating expenses, which help boost your returns, index 
funds are usually tax-friendlier to invest in when you invest outside retirement 
accounts. Fund managers of actively managed portfolios, in their attempts to 
increase returns, buy and sell securities more frequently. This trading, however, 

BONUS CHAPTER  Investing in Funds: Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds      283
increases a fund’s taxable capital gains distributions and reduces a fund’s after-
tax return.
Vanguard is the largest and most successful provider of index funds because it 
generally maintains the lowest annual operating fees in the business. Vanguard 
has all types of bond and stock (both U.S. and international) index funds. See my 
recommended-fund sections later in this chapter.
Understanding exchange-traded funds: 
Index funds that trade
Index mutual funds, which track particular market indexes and the best of which 
feature low costs, have been around for decades. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) 
represent a twist on index funds. ETFs trade as stocks do and offer some potential 
advantages over traditional mutual funds, but they also have some potential 
drawbacks.
As with index funds, the promise of ETFs is low management fees. I say promise 
because the vast majority of ETFs actually have expense ratios far higher than 
those of the best index funds.
In addition to slightly lower expenses, the best ETFs have one possible advantage 
over traditional index funds: Because ETFs may not be forced to redeem shares to 
cash and recognize taxable gains (which can happen with an index fund), they 
may be tax-friendlier for non-retirement-account investors.
If you can’t meet the minimum investment amounts for index funds (typically, 
several thousand dollars), you face no minimums when buying an ETF, but you 
must factor in the brokerage costs of buying and selling ETF shares through your 
favorite brokerage firm. Suppose you pay a $10 transaction fee through an online 
broker to buy $1,000 worth of an ETF. That $10 may not sound like much, but it 
represents 1 percent of your investment and wipes out the supposed cost advan-
tage of investing in an ETF.  Because of the brokerage costs, ETFs aren’t good 
vehicles for investors who seek to make regular monthly investments. (Note: Some 
brokers waive brokerage fees for trading their own ETFs and selected other ETFs.)
Here are some drawbacks of ETFs:
»
» The perils of market timing: Being able to trade in and out of an ETF during 
the trading day presents challenges. In my experience working with individual 
investors, most people find it both nerve-racking and futile to try to time their 
moves in and out of stocks with the inevitable fluctuations that take place 
during the trading day. In theory, traders want to believe that they can buy at 

284      Investing in Your 20s & 30s For Dummies
relatively low prices and sell at relatively high prices, but that’s far easier said 
than done.
»
» Brokerage commission every time you trade: With no-load index funds, 
you generally don’t pay fees to buy and sell. With ETFs, however, because 
you’re actually placing a trade on a stock exchange, you generally pay a 
brokerage commission every time you trade. (Note: Some brokers offer 
certain ETFs without brokerage charges in the hope of getting your account 
and making money on other investments.)
»
» Fluctuating prices: Because ETFs fluctuate in price based on supply and 
demand, when you place a trade during the trading day, you face the 
complication of trying to determine whether the current price on an ETF is 
above or below the actual value. With an index fund, you know that the price 
at which your trade was executed equals the exact market value of the 
securities it holds.
»
» Poorly diversified investments: Many ETFs (that don’t invest in an index) 
invest in narrow segments, such as one specific industry or one foreign 
country. Such funds undermine the diversification value of fund investing and 
tend to have relatively high fees.
»
» Excessive risks and costs with leverage: ETF issuers have come out with 
increasingly risky and costly ETFs. One particular class of ETFs I especially 
dislike consists of so-called leveraged ETFs. These ETFs claim to magnify the 
move of a particular index, such as the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index, by 
double or triple. So a double-leveraged S&P 500 ETF is supposed to increase 
by 2 percent for every 1 percent increase in the S&P 500 index. My investiga-
tions of whether the leveraged ETFs actually deliver on their objectives show 
that they don’t — in fact, they don’t even come close. Leveraged ETFs aren’t 
investments; they’re gambling instruments for day traders.
Creating and Managing a Fund Portfolio
When you invest money for the longer term, such as for retirement, you can 
choose among the various types of funds that I discuss in this chapter. Most peo-
ple get a big headache when they try to decide how to spread their money among 
the choices. This section helps you begin cutting through the clutter for longer-
term investing. (I discuss recommended funds for shorter-term goals later in this 
chapter as well.)
Asset allocation simply means that you decide what percentage of your investments 
you place, or allocate, in bonds versus stocks and international stocks versus U.S. 

BONUS CHAPTER  Investing in Funds: Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds      285
stocks. Asset allocation can include other assets, such as real estate and small 
business, which are discussed throughout this book.
In your 20s and 30s, time is on your side, and you should use that time to your 
advantage. You may have many decades before you need to draw on some portion 
of your retirement-account assets, for example. If some of your investments drop 
in value over a year or even over several years, the investments have plenty of 
time to recover before you spend the money during retirement.
Your current age and the number of years until you retire are the biggest factors 
in your allocation decision. The younger you are and the more years you have 
before retirement, the more comfortable you should be with volatile, growth-
oriented investments, such as stock funds.
Table  10-1 provides my guidelines for allocating fund money that you’ve ear-
marked for long-term purposes, such as retirement. It’s a simple but powerful 
formula that uses your current age and the level of risk you’re willing to take with 
your investments.
Suppose you’re an aggressive type who prefers taking a fair amount of risk to 
make your money grow faster. Using Table 10-1, if you’re 30 years old, consider 
putting 10 percent (30 – 20) into bond funds and 90 percent (120 – 30) into stock 
funds.
Now divvy up your stock investment money between U.S. and international funds. 
Here are the portions of your stock allocation that I recommend investing in over-
seas stocks:
»
» 20 percent for a play-it-safe attitude
»
» 35 percent for a middle-of-the-road attitude
»
» 50 percent for an aggressive attitude
TABLE 10-1 
Longer-Term Fund Asset Allocation

Middle of the road

= 110 – Age
Aggressive
= Age – 20
= 120 – Age

286      Investing in Your 20s & 30s For Dummies
If, in Table 10-1, the 30-year-old aggressive type invests 90 percent in stocks, 
then she can invest about 50 percent of the stock fund investments (which works 
out to be around 45 percent of the total) in international stock funds.
So here’s what the 30-year-old aggressive investor’s portfolio asset allocation 
looks like:
Bonds
10 percent
U.S. stocks
45 percent
International stocks
45 percent
Suppose your investment allocation decisions suggest that you invest 50 percent 
in U.S. stock funds. Which ones do you choose? As I explain in “Picking the best 
stock funds” later in this chapter, stock funds differ on several levels. You can 
choose among growth-oriented stocks and funds and those that focus on value 
stocks, as well as funds that focus on small-, medium-, or large-company stocks. 
I explain these types of stocks and funds later in this chapter. You also need to 
decide what portion you want to invest in index funds versus actively managed 
funds that try to beat the market.
Deciding how much you should use index versus actively managed funds is really 
a matter of personal taste. If you’re satisfied knowing that you’ll get the market 
rate of return and that you can’t underperform the market (after accounting for 
your costs), index your entire portfolio. On the other hand, if you enjoy the chal-
lenge of trying to pick the better managers and want the potential to earn more 
than the market level of returns, don’t use index funds at all. Investing in a happy 
medium of both, as I do, is always a safe bet.
Identifying the Best Mutual Funds 
and ETFs
In this section, I explain the different types of funds — stock, bond, and money 
market — and where to find the best ones. Remember that with stock funds and 
bond funds, you have the option of investing in ETFs as well as traditional mutual 
funds.
Investing in the best ETFs
Like the vast majority of investors, you don’t need to complicate your life by 
investing in ETFs. Use them only if you’re an advanced investor who understands 

BONUS CHAPTER  Investing in Funds: Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds      287
index funds and you’ve found a superior ETF for a given index fund that you’re 
interested in.
I strongly encourage you to employ the buy-and-hold mentality that I advocate 
throughout this book. Don’t hop in and out of ETFs. Also, you should buy only the 
ETFs that track the broader market indexes and that have the lowest expense 
ratios. Avoid those that track narrow industry groups or single small countries.
Check whether the ETF you’re considering is selling at a premium or discount to 
its net asset value. You can find this information on the ETF provider’s website 
after the market’s close each business day.
The best ETFs, like the best index funds, have low expense ratios. My top picks 
among the leading providers of ETFs include the following:
»
» Vanguard: Historically, Vanguard has been the low-cost leader with index 
funds, and now it has low-cost ETFs as well. If you’re interested in finding 
out more about ETFs, be sure to examine Vanguard’s ETFs. Vanguard also 
offers the Admiral Share class for bigger-balance customers (more than 
$100,000) of its index funds that match the low expense ratio on its ETFs. 
(https://personal.vanguard.com/us/home; 800-662-7447)
»
» WisdomTree: This family of indexes is weighted toward stocks paying higher 
dividends. These ETFs have higher fees but offer a broad family of index 
choices for investors seeking stocks that pay higher dividends. Note: Other 
ETF providers offer several value-oriented and high-dividend-paying stock 
funds. (www.wisdomtree.com; 866-909-9473)
Three additional and larger providers of ETFs include the following firms (beware 
that some of their ETFs are pricey or too narrowly focused):
»
» iShares: BlackRock has competitive expense ratios on some domestic ETFs 
based on quality indexes, such as Russell, Morningstar, S&P, Lehman, Dow 
Jones, and so on. Fidelity offers dozens of iShare ETFs free of brokerage 
charges. (www.ishares.com; 800-474-2737)
»
» Schwab: The investment brokerage firm Charles Schwab, which revolution-
ized the discount brokerage business, offers many very low cost ETFs.  
(www.schwab.com; 800-435-4000)
»
» State Street Global Advisors SPDRs: This group uses indexes from Dow 
Jones, S&P, Russell, and MSCI, among others. (www.ssgafunds.com; 
866-787-2257)

Picking the best stock funds
Stock funds differ from one another in several dimensions. The following charac-
teristics are what you should pay the most attention to:
»
» Company location: Stocks and the companies that issue that stock are 
classified based on the location of their main operations and headquarters. 
Funds that specialize in U.S. stocks are, not surprisingly, called U.S. stock funds; 
those that focus overseas typically are called international or overseas funds.
»
» Growth stocks versus value stocks: Stock fund managers and their funds 
are categorized by whether they invest in growth or value stocks.
•	 Growth stocks have high prices in relation to the company’s assets, profits, 
and potential profits. Growth companies typically experience rapidly 
expanding revenue and profits. These companies tend to reinvest most of 
their earnings in the company to fuel future expansion; thus, these stocks 
pay no or low dividends.
•	 Value stocks are priced cheaply in relation to the company’s assets, profits, 
and potential profits. Value stocks tend to pay higher dividends than 
growth stocks and historically have produced higher total returns.
»
» Company size: Another dimension on which a stock fund’s stock selection 
differs is based on the size of the company in which the fund invests: small, 
medium, or large. The total market value — capitalization, or cap for short — 
of a company’s outstanding stock defines the categories of the stocks that the 
fund invests in. Small-capitalization stocks are usually defined as stocks of 
companies that possess total market capitalization of less than $2 billion. 
Medium-capitalization stocks have market values of $2 billion to $10 billion. 
Large-capitalization stocks are those of companies with market values greater 
than $10 billion. (Note: These definitions can change over time.)
Putting together two or three of these major classifications, you can start to com-
prehend those lengthy names that are given to various stock funds. You can have 
funds that focus on large-company value stocks or small-company growth stocks. 
You can add U.S., international, and worldwide funds to further subdivide these 
categories into more fund types. So you can have international stock funds that 
focus on small-company stocks or growth stocks.
You can purchase several stock funds, each focusing on a different type of stock, 
to diversify into various types of stocks. Two potential advantages result from 
doing so:

» Not all your money rides in one stock fund and with one fund manager.
»
» Each of the different fund managers can look at and track particular stock 
investment possibilities.
The following sections describe the best stock funds that are worthy of your 
consideration.
U.S. stock funds
Of all the types of funds offered, U.S. stock funds are the largest category. The only 
way to know for sure where a fund currently invests (or where the fund may 
invest in the future) is to ask. You can call the fund company that you’re interested 
in to start your information search, or you can visit the company’s website. You 
can also read the fund’s annual report. (The prospectus generally doesn’t tell you 
what the fund currently invests in or has invested in.)

(800-662-7447; www.vanguard.com)
International stock funds
Be sure to invest in stock funds that invest overseas for diversification and growth 
potential. You usually can tell that you’re looking at a fund that focuses its invest-
ments overseas if its name contains the word International, which typically means 
the fund’s stock holdings are foreign only. If the fund name includes the word 
Global or Worldwide, such funds generally hold both foreign and U.S. stocks.
Shun foreign funds that invest in just one smaller country. As with investing in a 
sector fund that specializes in a particular industry, this lack of diversification 
defeats a major benefit of investing in funds. Funds that focus on specific regions, 
such as Southeast Asia, are better but generally still problematic because of poor 
diversification and higher expenses than those of other, more-diversified inter-
national funds.

290      Investing in Your 20s & 30s For Dummies
If you want to invest in more geographically limiting international funds, take a 
look at T. Rowe Price’s and Vanguard’s offerings, which invest in broader regions, 
such as investing just in Europe, Asia, and the volatile but higher-growth- 
potential emerging markets in Southeast Asia and Latin America.
In addition to the risks normally inherent with stock fund investing, changes in 
the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar cause price changes in 
international stocks. A decline in the value of the U.S. dollar helps the value of 
foreign stock funds. Conversely, a rising dollar versus other currencies can reduce 
the value of foreign stocks. Some foreign stock funds hedge against currency 
changes. Although this hedging helps reduce volatility, it does cost money.
Here are my picks for diversified international funds:

Balancing your act: Funds that combine 
stocks and bonds
Some funds — generally known as balanced funds — invest in both bonds and 
stocks. These funds are usually less risky and less volatile than funds that invest 
exclusively in stocks. In an economic downturn, bonds usually hold value better 
than stocks do.
Balanced funds make it easier for investors who are skittish about investing in 
stocks to hold stocks because they reduce the volatility that normally comes with 
pure stock funds. Because of their extensive diversification, balanced funds are 
also excellent choices for an investor who doesn’t have much money to start with.

BONUS CHAPTER  Investing in Funds: Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds      291
Balanced funds aren’t appropriate for some investors who purchase funds outside 
tax-sheltered retirement accounts because these funds pay decent dividends from 
the bonds that they hold. With the exception of the Vanguard Tax-Managed Bal-
anced Fund, which holds federal-tax-free bonds, you should avoid balanced funds 
if you’re in a higher tax bracket. Consider buying separate tax-friendly stock 
funds and tax-free bond funds to create your own balanced portfolio.
Here’s my short list of great balanced funds:

Finding the best bond funds
Although there are thousands of bond fund choices, not many remain after you 
eliminate high-cost funds, low-performance funds, and funds managed by fund 
companies and fund managers with minimal experience investing in bonds (all 
key points that I address in “Maximizing Your Chances for Fund Investing Suc-
cess” earlier in this chapter).
Among the key considerations when choosing bond funds are
»
» Years to maturity: Bond-fund objectives and names usually fit one of three 
maturity categories: short-, intermediate-, and long-term. You can generally 
earn a higher yield from investing in a bond fund that holds longer-term 
bonds, but such bond prices are more sensitive to changes in interest rates. 
(Duration, which quantifies a bond fund’s sensitivity to changes in interest 
rates, is another term you may come across. A fund with a duration of eight 
years means that if interest rates rise by 1 percent, the fund should decline by 
8 percent.)
»
» Bond credit quality: The lower the issuer’s credit rating, the riskier the bond. 
As with the risk associated with longer maturities, a fund that holds lower-
quality bonds should provide higher returns for the increased risk you take. 
A higher yield is the bond market’s way of compensating you for taking 
greater risk. Funds holding higher-quality bonds provide lower returns but 
more security.

292      Investing in Your 20s & 30s For Dummies
»
» Fees and costs: After you settle on the type of bonds you want, you must 
consider a bond fund’s costs, including its sales commissions and annual 
operating fees. Stick with no-load funds that maintain lower annual operating 
expenses.
»
» Taxability: Pay attention to the taxability of the dividends that bonds pay. If 
you’re investing in bonds inside retirement accounts, you want taxable bonds. 
If you invest in bonds outside retirement accounts, the choice between 
taxable and tax-free depends on your tax bracket.
»
» Type of bond issuer: Bonds can be issued by corporations, state and local 
governments, the federal government, and foreign entities (corporate and 
governments). Although some bond funds hold an eclectic mix, many focus 
on specific types of bonds (such as corporate bonds).
Because bond funds fluctuate in value, invest in them only if you have sufficient 
money in an emergency reserve. If you invest money for longer-term purposes, 
particularly retirement, you need to come up with an overall plan for allocating 
your money among a variety of funds, including bond funds.
The dangers of yield-chasing
When selecting bond funds to invest in, investors are often led astray as to how 
much they can expect to make. The first mistake is looking at recent performance 
and assuming that you’ll get that return in the future.
Investing in bond funds based on recent performance is particularly tempting 
immediately after a period where interest rates have declined, because declines in 
interest rates pump up bond prices and, therefore, bond funds’ total returns. 
Remember that an equal but opposite force waits to counteract high bond returns 
as bond prices fall when interest rates rise.
To make performance numbers meaningful and useful, you must compare bond 
funds that are comparable, such as intermediate-term funds that invest exclu-
sively in high-grade corporate bonds.
Bond funds calculate their yield after subtracting their operating expenses. When 
you contact a fund company seeking a fund’s current yield, make sure you under-
stand what time period the yield covers. Fund companies are supposed to give you 
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) yield, which is a standard yield 
calculation that allows for fairer comparisons among bond funds. The SEC yield, 
which reflects the bond fund’s yield to maturity, is the best yield to use when you 
compare funds because it captures the effective rate of interest that an investor 
can receive in the future.

BONUS CHAPTER  Investing in Funds: Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds      293
If you select bond funds based on advertised yield, you’re quite likely to purchase 
the wrong bond funds. Bond funds and the fund companies that sell them can play 
more than a few games to fatten a fund’s yield. Higher yields make it easier for 
salespeople and funds to hawk their bond funds. Remember that yield-enhancing 
shenanigans can leave you poorer. Here’s what you need to watch out for:
»
» Lower-credit-quality bonds: When comparing one bond fund with another, 
you may discover that one pays a higher yield and decide that it looks better. 
You may find out later, however, that the higher-yielding fund invests a 
sizeable chunk of its money in junk (non-investment-grade) bonds, whereas 
the other fund fully invests only in high-quality bonds.
»
» Longer-maturity bonds: Bond funds usually can increase their yield just by 
increasing their maturity a bit. So if one short-term bond fund invests in 
bonds that mature in an average of two years, and another fund has an 
average maturity of seven years, comparing the two is comparing apples and 
oranges.
»
» Return of principal as dividends: Some funds return a portion of your 
principal in the form of dividends. This move artificially pumps up a fund’s 
yield but actually depresses its total return. When you compare bond funds, 
make sure you compare their total return over time in addition to making 
sure they have comparable portfolios of bonds.
»
» Temporary waivers of expenses: Some bond funds, particularly newer ones, 
waive a portion or even all of their operating expenses to inflate the fund’s 
yield temporarily. Bond funds that engage in this practice often quietly end 
their expense waiver when the bond market is performing well.
Recommended short-term bond funds
Short-term bonds work well for money that you earmark for use in a few years, 
such as to purchase a home or a car, and for money that you plan to withdraw 
from your retirement account in the near future.
Short-term bond funds are the least sensitive to interest rate fluctuations in the 
bond-fund universe. The stability of short-term bond funds makes them appro-
priate investments for money on which you seek a better rate of return than a 
money market fund can produce for you. With short-term bond funds, however, 
you also have to tolerate the risk of losing a percentage or two in principal value if 
interest rates rise.
Consider bond funds that pay taxable dividends when you’re not in a high tax 
bracket and when you want to invest inside retirement accounts. My favorite is 
the Vanguard Short-Term Investment-Grade fund.

294      Investing in Your 20s & 30s For Dummies
U.S. Treasury bond funds may be appropriate if you prefer a bond fund that invests 
in U.S. Treasuries, which possess the safety of government backing. They’re also 
a fine choice if you’re not in a high federal tax bracket but are in a high state tax 
bracket (5 percent or higher). Vanguard Short-Term Treasury is a good choice. I 
don’t recommend Treasuries for retirement accounts because they pay less inter-
est than fully taxable bond funds.
State- and federal-tax-free short-term bond funds are scarce. If you want short-
term bonds, and if you’re in a high federal tax bracket but in a low state tax 
bracket (less than 5 percent), consider investing in these federal-tax-free bond 
funds (whose dividends are state-taxable):

» Vanguard Short-Term Tax-Exempt (800-662-7447; www.vanguard.com)
»
» Vanguard Limited-Term Tax-Exempt (800-662-7447; www.vanguard.com)
If you live in a state with high taxes, consider checking out the state- and federal- 
tax-free intermediate-term bond funds (which I discuss in the next section) if 
you can withstand their volatility.
Recommended intermediate-term bond funds
Intermediate-term bond funds hold bonds that typically mature in a decade or so. 
They’re more volatile than shorter-term bonds but can also be more rewarding. 
The longer you own an intermediate-term bond fund, the more likely you are to 
earn a higher return on it than on a short-term fund unless interest rates continue 
to rise over many years.
As an absolute minimum, don’t purchase an intermediate-term fund unless you 
expect to hold it for three to five years — or even longer, if you can. Therefore, you 
need to make sure the money you put in an immediate-term fund is money that 
you don’t expect to use in the near future.
Taxable intermediate-term bond funds to consider include the following:
»
» Dodge & Cox Income (800-621-3979; www.dodgeandcox.com)
»
» Doubleline Total Return (877-354-6311; www.doubleline.com)
»
» Vanguard Total Bond Market Index and ETF (800-662-7447; www.vanguard.com)
Consider U.S.  Treasury bond funds if you prefer a bond fund that invests in 
U.S. Treasuries, which provide the safety of government backing. You can also 
invest in them if you’re not in a high federal tax bracket but are in a high state tax 

BONUS CHAPTER  Investing in Funds: Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds      295
bracket (5 percent or higher). A couple of my favorites are Vanguard Inflation-
Protected Securities and Vanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury. I don’t recom-
mend Treasuries for retirement accounts because they pay less interest than fully 
taxable bond funds.
Consider federal-tax-free bond funds if you’re in a high federal tax bracket but a 
relatively low state tax bracket (less than 5 percent). Good ones include
»
» Fidelity Intermediate Municipal Income (800-343-3548; www.fidelity.com)
»
» Vanguard Intermediate-Term Tax-Exempt (800-662-7447; www.vanguard.com)
If you’re in high federal and state tax brackets, refer to the state- and federal- 
tax-free bond fund company providers that I mention in the next section.
Recommended long-term bond funds
Long-term bond funds are the most aggressive and volatile bond funds around. If 
interest rates on long-term bonds increase substantially, you can easily see the 
principal value of your investment decline 10 percent or more.
Long-term bond funds are generally used for retirement investing in one of two 
situations by investors who
»
» Don’t expect to tap their investment money for a decade or more
»
» Want to maximize current dividend income and are willing to tolerate volatility
Don’t use long-term bond funds to invest money that you plan to use within the 
next five years, because a bond-market drop can leave your portfolio short of your 
monetary goal.
My favorite taxable bond fund that holds longer-term bonds is the Vanguard 
Long-Term Investment-Grade fund (800-662-7447; www.vanguard.com). Also 
consider the Vanguard Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF.
U.S.  Treasury bond funds may be advantageous if you want a bond fund that 
invests in U.S. Treasuries. They’re also great if you’re not in a high federal tax 
bracket but are in a high state tax bracket (5 percent or higher). I recommend 
Treasuries for non-retirement accounts only because Treasuries pay less interest 
than fully taxable bond funds. I recommend the Vanguard Long-Term Treasury 
fund (800-662-7447; www.vanguard.com).

296      Investing in Your 20s & 30s For Dummies
State and federally tax-free bond funds may be appropriate when you’re in high 
federal and state (5 percent or higher) tax brackets. A municipal (federal-tax- 
free) long-term bond fund that I recommend is Vanguard Long-Term Tax-
Exempt. Fidelity, T. Rowe Price, and Vanguard offer good funds for several states. 
If you can’t find a good state-specific fund where you live, or if you’re in a high 
federal tax bracket, you can use the nationwide Vanguard Municipal bond funds.
Considering Alternatives  
to Investing in Funds
If you’re getting into the investment game, you’ll likely hear about, and be pitched, 
some alternatives to investing in funds. In this section, I reveal the truth about 
those options.
Your own online fund
On some websites, various services claim that you can invest in a chosen basket of 
stocks for a low fee and without the high taxes and high fees that come with 
mutual fund investing.
These “create your own funds” services pitch their investment products as supe-
rior alternatives to mutual funds. One such service calls its investment vehicles 
folios, charging you $29 per month ($290 per year paid in advance) to invest in 
folios, each of which can hold a few dozen stocks that are selected from the uni-
verse of stocks that this service makes available. The fee covers trading in your 
folios that may occur only during two time windows each day that the stock mar-
ket is open. Thus, in addition to the burden of managing your own portfolio of 
stocks, you have virtually no control of the timing of your trades during the trad-
ing day.
According to my analysis, you’d need to invest more than $150,000 through this 
folio service to come out ahead in terms of the explicit fees. You also need to be 
aware of additional fees, which you usually have to search the fine print to find. 
You may get whacked $30 to wire money out of your account or even $100 to close 
an account and have it transferred elsewhere!
Evaluating the performance of self-created funds is difficult. Also, unlike mutual 
funds, these funds have no standards or easily accessible services that report and 
track the performance of your customized folio.

BONUS CHAPTER  Investing in Funds: Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds      297
Unit investment trusts
Unit investment trusts (UITs) have much in common with both mutual funds and 
exchange-traded funds. UITs take a fixed initial amount of money and buy securi-
ties that meet the objectives of the UIT. Unlike a mutual fund, however, a UIT 
doesn’t make any changes in its holdings over time. This holding of a diversified 
portfolio can be advantageous because it reduces trading costs and possible tax 
bills.
With that said, UITs do suffer from the following major flaws:
»
» High commissions: Brokers like to sell UITs for the same reason they like to 
pitch load mutual funds: the commissions paid out of your investment. 
Commissions usually are around 5 percent, so for every $10,000 that you 
invest in a UIT, $500 comes out of your investment and goes into the broker’s 
pocket. (Although UITs do have ongoing fees, their fees tend to be lower than 
those of most actively managed mutual funds — typically, in the neighbor-
hood of 0.2 percent per year. The best no-load funds also have reasonable 
management fees, and some charge even less than UITs charge.)
»
» Lack of liquidity: Especially in the first few years after a particular UIT is 
issued, you won’t readily find an active market in which you can easily sell 
your UIT. In the event that you can find someone who’s interested in buying a 
UIT that you want to sell, you’ll likely have to sell the UIT at a discount from its 
actual market value at the time.
»
» Lack of ongoing management oversight: Because UITs buy and hold a fixed 
set of securities until the UITs are liquidated (years down the road), they’re 
more likely to get stuck holding some securities that end up worthless. 
Compared with the best bond funds, bond UITs are more likely to end up 
holding bonds in companies that go bankrupt.
Brokerage managed accounts
Brokerage firms offer investment management services for an ongoing fee rather 
than commissions. (Merrill Lynch is one common example of a brokerage firm.) 
Wrap accounts, or managed accounts, go by a variety of names, but they’re the 
same in one crucial way: For the privilege of investing your money through their 
chosen money managers, they charge you a percentage of the assets that they’re 
managing for you. These accounts are quite similar to mutual funds except that 
the accounts don’t have the same regulatory and reporting requirements.
These managed accounts tend to have relatively high fees — upward of 2 percent 
per year of assets under management. No-load mutual funds and ETFs offer 

298      Investing in Your 20s & 30s For Dummies
investors access to the nation’s best investment managers for a fraction of the 
cost of brokerage managed accounts. Many excellent funds are available for 0.5 
percent or less annually.
Hedge funds for the wealthier
Hedge funds, historically investments reserved for big-ticket investors, seem to 
be like mutual funds in that they typically invest in stocks and bonds. They have 
the added glamour and allure, however, of taking significant risks and gambles 
with their investments. Here’s how they stack up compared with mutual funds 
and ETFs:
»
» Hedge funds are often much higher-risk. When a hedge fund manager bets 
right, he can produce high returns. When he doesn’t, however, his fund can 
get clobbered. With short selling, because the value of the security that was 
sold short can rise an unlimited amount, the potential loss from buying it back 
at a much higher price can be horrendous. Hedge fund managers have also 
been clobbered when a previously fast-rising commodity, such as natural gas 
or copper futures, plunges in value or an investment they make with leverage 
goes the wrong direction. Several hedge funds went belly-up when their 
managers guessed wrong. In other words, their investments did so poorly that 
investors in the fund lost everything. This won’t occur with a mutual fund 
or an ETF.
»
» Hedge funds have much higher fees. Hedge funds charge an annual 
management fee of about 1 percent to 2 percent and a performance fee, 
which typically amounts to a whopping 20 percent of a fund’s profits.
»
» Hedge funds have had problems with fraud and lousy returns. During the 
severe stock market decline in the late 2000s, many hedge funds did poorly. 
Some funds went under or were exposed to be Ponzi schemes, the most 
notorious being the fund run by the now-jailed Bernie Madoff. According to 
Forbes magazine, “Hedge funds exist in a lawless and risky realm. . . . Hedge 
funds aren’t even required to keep audited books — and many don’t.” They’re 
often “guilty of inadequate disclosure of costs, overvaluation of holdings to 
goose reported performance and manager pay, and cozy ties between funds 
and brokers that often shortchange investors.” Objective studies of all hedge 
fund returns show that they underperform funds, which makes sense, 
because hedge funds have the burden of much higher fees.

About the Author
Eric Tyson is an internationally acclaimed and bestselling personal finance author 
and speaker. He has worked with and taught people from all financial situations, 
so he knows the financial concerns and questions of real folks. Despite having an 
MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business and a BS in economics and 
biology from Yale University, Eric remains a master of “keeping it simple.”
He figured out how to pursue his dream after working as a management consul-
tant to Fortune 500 financial-service firms. Eric took his inside knowledge of the 
banking, investment, and insurance industries and committed himself to making 
personal financial management accessible to all.
He is the author of five national bestselling financial books in Wiley Publishing’s 
For Dummies series, including books on personal finance, investing, mutual funds, 
home buying (coauthor), and real estate investing (coauthor). His Personal Finance 
For Dummies won the Benjamin Franklin Award for best business book of the year. 
An accomplished personal finance writer, his “Investors’ Guide” syndicated col-
umn, distributed by King Features, is read by millions nationally, and he was an 
award-winning columnist for the San Francisco Examiner.
Eric’s work has been featured and quoted in hundreds of local and national pub-
lications, including Newsweek, The Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tri-
bune, Forbes, Kiplinger’s Personal Finance, Parenting, Money, and Bottom Line/Personal; 
on NBC’s Today Show, ABC, CNBC, PBS’s Nightly Business Report, CNN, and FOX; and

Dedication
This book is hereby and irrevocably dedicated to my family and friends, as well as 
to my counseling clients and customers, who ultimately have taught me every-
thing I know about how to explain financial terms and strategies so all of us may 
benefit.

Author’s Acknowledgments
I hold many people accountable for my perverse and maniacal interest in figuring 
out money matters and the financial-services industry, but most of the blame 
falls on my loving parents, Charles and Paulina, who taught me most of what I 
know that’s been of use in the real world.
I’d also like to thank Rocky Shepard and all the good folks at King Features for 
believing in and supporting my writing and teaching.
Many thanks to all the people who provided insightful comments on this book, 
especially and including Morgan Housel.
And thanks to all the wonderful people on the front line and behind the scenes at 
my publisher, Wiley Publishing, especially Vicki Adang, Tracy Boggier, and Christy 
Pingleton.
