Foreword
Here’s a new one—a calculus book that doesn’t take itself too seriously! I can honestly say
that in all my years as a math major, I’ve never come across a book like this.
My name is Danica McKellar. I am primarily an actress and filmmaker (probably most
recognized by my role as “Winnie Cooper” on The Wonder Years), but a while back I took
a 4-year sidetrack and majored in Mathematics at UCLA. During that time I also co-
authored the proof of a new math theorem and became a published mathematician. What
can I say? I love math!
But let’s face it. You’re not buying this book because you love math. And that’s okay.
Frankly, most people don’t love math as much as I do … or at all for that matter. This
book is not for the dedicated math majors who want every last technical aspect of each
concept explained to them in precise detail.
This book is for every Bio major who has to pass two semesters of calculus to satisfy the
university’s requirements. Or for every student who has avoided mathematical formulas
like the plague, but is suddenly presented with a whole textbook full of them. I knew a
student who switched majors from chemistry to English, in order to avoid calculus!
Mr. Kelley provides explanations that give you the broad strokes of calculus concepts—
and then he follows up with specific tools (and tricks!) to solve some of the everyday
problems that you will encounter in your calculus classes.
You can breathe a sigh of relief—the content of this book will not demand of you what
your other calculus textbooks do. I found the explanations in this book to be, by and
large, friendly and casual. The definitions don’t concern themselves with high-end accu-
racy, but will bring home the essence of what the heck your textbook was trying to
describe with their 50-cent math words. In fact, don’t think of this as a textbook at all.
What you will find here is a conversation on paper that will hold your hand, make
jokes(!), and introduce you to the major topics you’ll be required to learn for your current
calculus class. The friendly tone of this book is a welcome break from the clinical nature
of every other math book I’ve ever read!
And oh, Mr. Kelley’s colorful metaphors—comparing piecewise functions to Franken-
stein’s body parts—well, you’ll understand when you get there.
My advice would be to read the chapters of this book as a nonthreatening introduction to
the basic calculus concepts, and then for fine-tuning, revisit your class’s textbook. Your
textbook explanations should make much more sense after reading this book, and you’ll
be more confident and much better qualified to appreciate the specific details required of
you by your class. Then you can remain in control of how detailed and nitpicky you want
to be in terms of the mathematical precision of your understanding by consulting your
“unfriendly” calculus textbook.
Congratulations for taking on the noble pursuit of calculus! And even more congratula-
tions to you for being proactive and buying this book. As a supplement to your more rig-
orous textbook, you won’t find a friendlier companion.
Good luck!

Introduction
Let’s be honest. Most people would like to learn calculus as much as they’d like to be
kicked in the face by a mule. Usually, they have to take the course because it’s required or
they walked too close to the mule, in that order. Calculus is dull, calculus is boring, and
calculus didn’t even get you anything for your birthday.
It’s not like you didn’t try to understand calculus. You even got this bright idea to try and
read your calculus textbook. What a joke that was. You’re more likely to receive the Nobel
Prize for chemistry than to understand a single word of it. Maybe you even asked a friend
of yours to help you, and talking to her was like trying to communicate with an Australian
aborigine. You guys just didn’t speak the same language.
You wish someone would explain things to you in a language that you understand, but in
the back of your mind, you know that the math lingo is going to come back to haunt you.
You’re going to have to understand it in order to pass this course, and you don’t think
you’ve got it in you. Guess what? You do!
Here’s the thing about calculus: things are never as bad as they seem. The mule didn’t
mean it, and I know this great plastic surgeon. I also know how terrifying calculus is. The
only thing scarier than learning it is teaching it to 35 high school students in a hot,
crowded room right before lunch. I’ve fought in the trenches at the front line and survived
to tell the tale. I can even tell it in a way that may intrigue, entertain, and teach you some-
thing along the way.
We’re going to journey together for a while. Allow me to be your guide in the wilderness
that is calculus. I’ve been here before and I know the way around. My goal is to teach you
all you’ll need to know to survive out here on your own. I’ll explain everything in plain
and understandable English. Whenever I work out a problem, I’ll show you every step
(even the simple ones) and I’ll tell you exactly what I’m doing and why. Then you’ll get a
chance to practice the skill on your own without my guidance. Never fear, though—I
answer the question for you fully and completely in the back of the book.
I’m not going to lie to you. You’re not going to find every single problem easy, but you
will eventually do every one. All you need is a little push in the right direction, and some-
one who knows how you feel. With all these things in place, you’ll have no trouble hoof-
ing it out. Oh, sorry, that’s a bad choice of words.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is presented in five parts.
In Part 1, “The Roots of Calculus,” you’ll learn why calculus is useful and what sorts of
skills it adds to your mathematical repertoire. You’ll also get a taste of its history, which is
marred by quite a bit of controversy. Being a math person, and by no means a history buff,

The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Calculus, Second Edition
I’ll get into the math without much delay. However, before we can actually start dis-
cussing calculus concepts, we’ll spend some quality time reviewing some prerequisite alge-
bra and trigonometry skills.
In Part 2, “Laying the Foundation for Calculus,” it’s time to get down and dirty. This
is the moment you’ve been waiting for. Or is it? Most people consider calculus the study
of derivatives and integrals, and we don’t really talk too much about those two guys until
Part 3. Am I just a royal tease? Nah. First, we have to talk about limits and continuity.
These foundational concepts constitute the backbone for the rest of calculus, and without
them, derivatives and integrals couldn’t exist.
Finally, we meet one of the major players in Part 3, “The Derivative.” The name says it
all. All of your major questions will be answered, including what a derivative is, how to
find one, and what to do if you run into one in a dark alley late at night. (Run!) You’ll also
learn a whole slew of major derivative-based skills: drawing graphs of functions you’ve
never seen, calculating how quickly variables change in given functions, and finding limits
that once were next to impossible to calculate. But wait, there’s more! How could some-
thing called a “wiggle graph” be anything but a barrel of giggles?
In Part 4, “The Integral,” you meet the other big boy of calculus. Integration is almost
the same as differentiation, except that you do it backwards. Intrigued? You’ll learn how
the area underneath a function is related to this backwards derivative, called an “antideriv-
ative.” It’s also time to introduce the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which (once and
for all) describes how all this crazy stuff is related. You’ll find out that integrals are a little
more disagreeable than derivatives were; they require you to learn more techniques, some
of which are extremely interesting and (is it possible?) even a little fun!
Now that you’ve met the leading actor and actress in this mathematical drama, what could
possibly be left? In Part 5, “Differential Equations, Sequences, Series, and Salutations,”
you meet the supporting cast. Although they play only very small roles, calculus wouldn’t
be calculus without them. You’ll experiment with differential equations using slope fields
and Euler’s Method, two techniques that have really gained popularity in the last decade of
calculus (and you thought that calculus has been the same since the beginning of time …).
Finally, you’ll play around with infinite series, which are similar to puzzles you’ve seen
since you started kindergarten (“Can you name the next number in this pattern?”). At the
very end, you can take a final exam on all the content of the book, and get even more
practice!
Extras
As a teacher, I constantly found myself going off on tangents—everything I mentioned
reminded me of something else. These peripheral snippets are captured in this book as
well. Here’s a guide to the different sidebars you’ll see peppering the pages that follow.

Introduction
Acknowledgments
There are many people who supported, cajoled, and endured me when I undertook the
daunting task of book writing and thn rewriting for the second edition. Although I cannot
thank all those who helped me, I do want to name a few of them here. First of all, thanks
to the people who made this book possible: Jessica Faust (for tracking me down and get-
ting me to write this puppy), Mike Sanders (who gave the green light and continues to do
so again and again), Nancy Lewis (who is the only person on earth who actually had to
read this whole thing), and Sue Strickland (who reviewed for technical accuracy because
she supports me no matter what I do, and because she enjoys telling her college students
who recommend my book, “I know about it. I’m in it.”). 
On a more personal level, there are a few other people I need to thank.
Lisa, who makes my life better and easier, by just being herself. Not many people would
have agreed to marry me, let alone thrive surrounded by three little people who will 
one day understand that the best way to say “I’m hungry” is not to scream until you soil
xv
These notes, tips, and thoughts
will assist, teach, and enter-
tain. They add a little some-
thing to the topic at hand,
whether it be sound advice, a bit
of wisdom, or just something to
lighten the mood a bit.
Critical Point
Calculus is chock-full of crazy-
and nerdy-sounding words and
phrases. In order to become
King or Queen Math Nerd, you'll
have to know what they mean!
Although I will warn you
about common pitfalls and
dangers throughout the book, the
dangers in these boxes deserve
special attention. Think of these
as skulls and crossbones painted
on little signs that stand along
your path. Heeding these cau-
tions can sometimes save you
hours of frustration.
Kelley’s Cautions
Math is not a spectator sport!
After we discuss a topic, I'll
explain how to work out a cer-
tain type of problem, and then
you have to try it on your own.
These problems will be very simi-
lar to those that I walk you
through in the chapters, but now
it's your turn to shine. Even
though all the answers appear in
Appendix A, you should only
look there to check your work.

yourself. Thanks for your patience, your kindness, and always telling me where the salad
spinner goes, since Lord knows I’ll never remember.
All my kids: Nick, Erin, and Sara. Despite all of my many faults, your Dad loves you very
much—but the best thing of all is that you already know that, and love me right back.
Can’t forget Mom, who worked 200 hours a week when things went south at our house,
just to make sure we’d get by.
To Dave, the Dawg (also spelled D-O-double G). I have learned much from you, not the
least of which is that, more than anything else, I also hate ironing shirts.
On to the friends who have stuck by me forever: Rob (Nickels) Halstead, Chris (The
Cobra) Sarampote, and Matt (The Prophet) Halnon—three great guys with whom I have
shared very squalid apartments and lots of good poker games. For convenience, their
poker nicknames are included, and for embarrassing reasons, mine is not.
Finally, to Joe, who always asked how the book was going, and for assuring me it’d be a
“home run.”
Special Thanks to the Technical Reviewer
The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Calculus, Second Edition, was reviewed by Susan Strickland, an
expert who double-checked the accuracy of what you’ll learn here. The publisher would
like to extend our thanks to Sue for helping us ensure that this book gets all its facts straight.
Susan Strickland received a B.S. in Mathematics from St. Mary’s College of Maryland in
1979, an M.S. in Mathematics from Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in
1982, and took graduate courses in Mathematics Education at The American University
in Washington, D.C., from 1989 through 1991. She was an assistant professor of mathe-
matics and supervised student mathematics teachers at St. Mary’s College of Maryland

You’ve heard of Newton, haven’t you? If not the man, then at least the fruit-
filled cookie? Well, the Sir Isaac variety of Newton is one of the two men
responsible for bringing calculus into your life and your course-requirement
list. Actually, he is just one of the two men who should shoulder the blame.
Calculus’s history is long, however, and its concepts predate either man.
Before we start studying calculus, we’ll take a (very brief) look at its history
and development and answer that sticky question: “Why do I have to learn
this?”
Next, it’s off to practice our prerequisite math skills. You wouldn’t try to
bench-press 300 pounds without warming up first, would you? A quick review
of linear equations, factoring, quadratic equations, function properties, and
trigonometry will do a body good. Even if you think you’re ready to jump
right into calculus, this brief review is recommended. I bet you’ve forgotten a
few things you’ll need to know later, so take care of that now!

◆The historic origins of calculus
◆The authorship controversy
◆Can I ever learn this?
The word calculus can mean one of two things: a computational method or a
mineral growth in a hollow organ of the body, such as a kidney stone. Either
definition often personifies the pain and anguish endured by students trying
to understand the subject. It is far from controversial to suggest that mathe-
matics is not the most popular of subjects in contemporary education; in fact,
calculus holds the great distinction of King of the Evil Math Realm, especially
by the math phobic. It represents an unattainable goal, an unthinkable miasma
of confusion and complication, and few venture into its realm unless propelled
by such forces as job advancement or degree requirement. No one knows how
much people fear calculus more than a calculus teacher.
The minute people find out that I taught a calculus class, they are compelled
to describe, in great detail, exactly how they did in high school math, what
subject they “topped out” in, and why they feel that calculus is the embodi-
ment of evil. Most of these people are my barbers, and I can’t explain why. All
of the friendly folks at the Hair Cuttery have come to know me as the strange
balding man with arcane and baffling mathematical knowledge.

Part 1: The Roots of Calculus
Most of the fears surrounding calculus are unjustified. Calculus is a step up from high
school algebra, no more. Following a straightforward list of steps, just like you do with
most algebra problems, solves the majority of calculus problems. Don’t get me wrong—
calculus is not always easy, and the problems are not always trivial, but it is not as impos-
ing as it seems. Calculus is a truly fascinating tool with innumerable applications to “real
life,” and for those of you who like soap operas, it’s got one of the biggest controversies in
history to its credit.
What’s the Purpose of Calculus?
Calculus is a very versatile and useful tool, not a one-trick pony by any stretch of the
imagination. Many of its applications are direct upgrades from the world of algebra—
methods of accomplishing similar goals, but in a far greater number of situations. Whereas
it would be impossible to list all the uses of calculus, the
following list represents some interesting highlights of
the things you will learn by the end of the book.
Finding the Slopes of Curves
One of the earliest algebra topics learned is how to find
the slope of a line—a numerical value that describes just
how slanted that line is. Calculus affords us a much
more generalized method of finding slopes. With it, we
can find not only how steeply a line slopes, but indeed,
how steeply any curve slopes at any given time. This
might not at first seem useful, but it is actually one of
the most handy mathematics applications around.
Calculating the Area of Bizarre Shapes
Without calculus, it is difficult to find areas of shapes other than those whose formulas
you learned in geometry. Sure, you may be a pro at finding the area of a circle, square,
rectangle, or triangle, but how would you find the area of a shape like the one shown in
Figure 1.1?
Justifying Old Formulas
There was a time in your math career when you took formulas on faith. Sometimes we still
need to do that, but calculus affords us the opportunity to finally verify some of those old
formulas, especially from geometry. You were always told that the volume of a cone was

What we call “calculus,” schol-
ars call “the calculus.” Because
any method of computation can
be called a calculus and the
discoveries comprising modern-
day calculus are so important,
the distinction is made to clarify. I
personally find the terminology a
little pretentious and won’t use it.
I’ve never been asked “Which
calculus are you talking about?”

one third the volume of a cylinder with the same radius 
, but through a sim-
ple calculus process of three-dimensional linear rotation, we can finally prove it. (By the
way, the process really is simple even though it may not sound like it right now.)

Calculate Complicated x-Intercepts
Without the aid of a graphing calculator, it is
exceptionally hard to calculate an irrational root.
However, a simple, repetitive process called
Newton’s Method (named after Sir Isaac Newton)
allows you to calculate an irrational root to what-
ever degree of accuracy you desire.
Visualizing Graphs
You may already have a good grasp of lines and
how to visualize their graphs easily, but what about
the graph of something like y = x3 + 2x2 – x + 1?
Very elementary calculus tells you exactly where that graph will be increasing, decreasing,
and twisting. In fact, you can find the highest and lowest points on the graph without plot-
ting a single point.
Finding the Average Value of a Function
Anyone can average a set of numbers, given the time and the fervent desire to divide.
Calculus allows you to take your averaging skills to an entirely new level. Now you can
even find, on average, what height a function travels over a period of time. For example, if
you graph the path of an airplane (see Figure 1.2), you can calculate its average cruising
altitude with little or no effort. Determining its average velocity and acceleration are no
harder. You may never have had the impetus to do such a thing, but you’ve got to admit
that it’s certainly more interesting than averaging the odd numbers less than 50.
An irrational root is an x-intercept
that is not a fraction. Fractional
(rational) roots are much easier to
find, because you can typically
factor the expression to calculate
them, a process that is taught in
the earliest algebra classes. No
good, generic process of finding
irrational roots is possible until
you use calculus.

Part 1: The Roots of Calculus
Calculating Optimal Values
One of the most mind-bendingly useful applications of calculus is the optimization of func-
tions. In just a few steps, you can answer questions such as “If I have 1,000 feet of fence,
what is the largest rectangular yard I can make?” or “Given a rectangular sheet of paper
which measures 8.5 inches by 11 inches, what are the dimensions of the box I can make
containing the greatest volume?” The traditional way to create an open box from a rec-
tangular surface is to cut congruent squares from the corners of the rectangle and then to
fold the resulting sides up, as shown in Figure 1.3.

Even though this plane’s
flight path is not defined by
a simple shape (like a semi-
circle), using calculus you
can calculate all sorts of
things, like its average alti-

I tend to think of learning calculus and all of its applications as suddenly growing a third
arm. Sure, it may feel funny having a third arm at first. In fact, it’ll probably make you
stand out in bizarre ways from those around you. However, given time, you’re sure to find
many uses for that arm that you’d have never imagined without having first possessed it.
Who’s Responsible for This?
Tracking the discovery of calculus is not as easy as, say, tracking the discovery of the safety
pin. Any new mathematical concept is usually the result of hundreds of years of investiga-
tion, debate, and debacle. Many come close to stumbling upon key concepts, but only the
lucky few who finally make the small, key connections receive the credit. Such is the case
with calculus.

Chapter 1: What Is Calculus, Anyway?
Calculus is usually defined as the combination of the differential and integral techniques
you will learn later in the book. However, historical mathematicians would never have
swallowed the concepts we take for granted today. The key ingredient missing in mathe-
matical antiquity was the hairy notion of infinity. Mathematicians and philosophers of the
time had an extremely hard time conceptualizing infinitely small or large quantities. Take,
for instance, the Greek philosopher Zeno.
Ancient Influences
Zeno took a very controversial position in mathematical philosophy: he argued that all
motion is impossible. In the paradox titled Dichotomy, he used a compelling, if not
strange, argument illustrated in Figure 1.4.

The most famous of Zeno’s paradoxes is a race between a tortoise and the legendary
Achilles called, appropriately, the Achilles. Zeno contends that if the tortoise has a
head start, no matter how small, Achilles will never be able to close the distance. To
do so, he’d have to travel half of the distance separating them, then half of that, ad
nauseum, presenting the same dilemma illustrated by the Dichotomy.
Critical Point

Part 1: The Roots of Calculus
In Zeno’s argument, the individual pictured wants to travel to the right, to his eventual
destination. However, before he can travel that distance (d1), he must first travel half of
that distance (d2). That makes sense, since d2 is smaller and comes first in the path.
However, before the d2 distance can be completed, he must first travel half of it (d3). This
procedure can be repeated indefinitely, which means that our beleaguered sojourner must
travel an infinite number of distances. No one can possibly do an infinite number of
things in a finite amount of time, says Zeno, since an infinite list will never be exhausted.
Therefore, not only will the man never reach his destination, he will, in fact, never start
moving at all! This could account for the fact that you never seem to get anything done
on Friday afternoons.
Zeno didn’t actually believe that motion was impossible.
He just enjoyed challenging the theories of his contem-
poraries. What he, and the Greeks of his time, lacked
was a good understanding of infinite behavior. It was
unfathomable that an innumerable number of things
could fit into a measured, fixed space. Today, geometry
students accept that a line segment, though possessing
fixed length, contains an infinite number of points. The
development of some reasonable and yet mathemati-
cally sound concept of very large quantities or very
small quantities was required before calculus could
sprout.
Some ancient mathematicians weren’t troubled by the apparent contradiction of an infi-
nite amount in a finite space. Most notably, Euclid and Archimedes contrived the method
of exhaustion as a technique to find the area of a circle, since the exact value of π wouldn’t
be around for some time. In this technique, regular polygons were inscribed in a circle;
the higher the number of sides of the polygon, the closer the area of the polygon would
be to the area of the circle (see Figure 1.5).
8
Figure 1.5
The higher the number of
sides, the closer the area
of the inscribed polygon
approximates the area of
the circle.
In order for the method of exhaustion (which is aptly titled, in my opinion) to give the
exact value for the circle, the polygon would have to have an infinite number of sides.
Indeed, this magical incarnation of geometry can only be considered theoretically, and the
idea that a shape of infinite sides could have a finite area made most people of the time
In case the suspense is killing
you, let me ruin the ending for
you. The essential link to com-
pleting calculus and satisfying
everyone’s concerns about infinite
behavior was the concept of
limit, which laid the foundation
for both derivatives and integrals.

Chapter 1: What Is Calculus, Anyway?
very antsy. However, seasoned calculus students of today can see this as a simple limit
problem. As the number of sides approaches infinity, the area of the polygon approaches
πr2, where r is the radius of the circle. Limits are essential to the development of both the
derivative and integral, the two fundamental components of calculus. Although Newton
and Leibniz were unearthing the major discoveries of calculus in the late 1600s and early
1700s, no one had established a formal limit definition. Although this may not keep us up
at night, it was, at the least, troubling at the time. Mathematicians worldwide started
sleeping more soundly at night circa 1751, when Jean Le Rond d’Alembert wrote Ency-
clopédie and established the formal definition of the limit. The delta-epsilon definition of
the limit we use today is very close to that of d’Alembert.
Even before its definition was established, however, Newton had given a good enough
shot at it that calculus was already taking shape.
Newton vs. Leibniz
Sir Isaac Newton, who was born in poor health in 1642 but became a world-renowned
smart guy (even during his own time), once retorted, “If I have seen farther than
Descartes, it is because I have stood on the shoulders of giants.” No truer thing could be
said about any major mathematical discovery, but let’s not give the guy too much credit
for his supposed modesty … more to come on that in a bit. Newton realized that infinite
series (e.g., the method of exhaustion) were not only great approximators, but if allowed
to actually reach infinity, they gave the exact values of the functions they approximated.
Therefore, they behaved according to easily definable laws and restrictions usually only
applied to known functions. Most importantly, he was the first person to recognize and
utilize the inverse relationship between the slope of a curve and the area beneath it.
That inverse relationship (contemporarily called the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus)
marks Newton as the inventor of calculus. He published his findings, and his intuitive 
definition of a limit, in his 1687 masterwork entitled Philosophiae Naturalis Principia
Mathematica. The Principia, as it is more commonly known today, is considered by some
(those who consider such things, I suppose) to be the greatest scientific work of all time,
excepting of course any books yet to be written by the comedian Sinbad. Calculus was
actively used to solve the major scientific dilemmas of the time:
◆Calculating the slope of the tangent line to a curve at any point along its length
◆Determining the velocity and acceleration of an object given a function describing
its position, and designing such a position function given the object’s velocity or
acceleration
◆Calculating arc lengths and the volume and surface area of solids
◆Calculating the relative and absolute extrema of objects, especially projectiles

Part 1: The Roots of Calculus
However, with a great discovery often comes great
controversy, and such is the case with calculus.
Enter Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, child prodigy and
mathematical genius. Leibniz was born in 1646 and
completed college, earning his Bachelor’s degree, at the
ripe old age of 17. Because Leibniz was primarily self-
taught in the field of mathematics, he often discovered
important mathematical concepts on his own, long after
someone else had already published them. Newton
actually credited Leibniz in his Principia for developing
a method similar to his. That similar method evolved
into a near match of Newton’s work in calculus, and in
fact, Leibniz published his breakthrough work invent-
ing calculus before Newton, although Newton had
already made the exact discovery years before Leibniz.
Some argue that Newton possessed extreme sensitivity
to criticism and was, therefore, slow to publish. The
mathematical war was on: who invented calculus first
and thus deserved the credit for solving a riddle thou-
sands of years old?
Today, Newton is credited for inventing calculus first,
although Leibniz is credited for its first publication. In
addition, the shadow of plagiarism and doubt has been
lifted from Leibniz, and it is believed that he discov-
ered calculus completely independent of Newton.
However, two distinct factions arose and fought a bitter
war of words. British mathematicians sided with Newton, whereas continental Europe
supported Leibniz, and the war was long and hard. In fact, British mathematicians were
effectively alienated from the rest of the European mathematical community because of
the rift, which probably accounts for the fact that there were no great mathematical dis-
coveries made in Britain for some time thereafter.
Although Leibniz just missed out on the discovery of calculus, many of his contributions
live on in the language and symbols of mathematics. In algebra, he was the first to use a
dot to indicate multiplication (3 ⋅4 = 12) and a colon to designate a proportion (1:2 = 3:6).
In geometry, he contributed the symbols for congruent (≅) and similar (∼). Most famous
of all, however, are the symbols for the derivative and the integral, which we also use.
10
Extrema points are high or low
points of a curve (maxima or min-
ima, respectively). In other words,
they represent extreme values of
the graph, whether extremely
high or extremely low, in relation
to the points surrounding them.
Ten years after Leibniz’s death,
Newton erased the reference to
Leibniz from the third edition of
the Principia as a final insult. This
is approximately the academic
equivalent of Newton throwing a
chair at Leibniz on The Jerry
Springer Show (topic: “You pub-
lished your solution to an ancient
mathematical riddle before me
and I’m fightin’ mad!”).

Chapter 1: What Is Calculus, Anyway?
Will I Ever Learn This?
History aside, calculus is an overwhelming
topic to approach from a student’s perspec-
tive. There are an incredible number of top-
ics, some of which are related, but most of
which are not in any obvious sense. How-
ever, there is no topic in calculus that is, in
and of itself, very difficult once you understand
what is expected of you. The real trick is to
quickly recognize what sort of problem is being
presented and then to attack it using the methods
you will read and learn in this book.
I have taught calculus for a number of years, to
high school students and adults alike, and I believe
that there are four basic steps to succeeding in 
calculus:
◆Make sure to understand what the major vocabulary words mean. This book will present
all important vocabulary terms in simple English, so you understand not only what
the terms mean, but how they apply to the rest of your knowledge.
◆Sift through the complicated wording of the important calculus theorems and strip away the
difficult language. Math is just as foreign a language as French or Spanish to someone
who doesn’t enjoy numbers, but that doesn’t mean you can’t understand complicated
mathematical theorems. I will translate every theorem into plain English and make
all the underlying implications perfectly clear.
◆Develop a mathematical instinct. As you read, I will help you recognize subtle clues
presented by calculus problems. Most problems do everything but tell you exactly
how they must be solved. If you read carefully, you will develop an instinct, a feeling
that will tingle in your inner fiber and guide you toward the right answers. This
comes with practice, practice, practice, so I’ll provide sample problems with detailed
solutions to help you navigate the muddy waters of calculus.
◆Sometimes you just have to memorize. There are some very advanced topics covered in
calculus that are hard to prove. In fact, many theorems cannot be proven until you
take much more advanced math courses. Whenever I think that proving a theorem
will help you understand it better, I will do so and discuss it in detail. However, if a
formula, rule, or theorem has a proof that I deem unimportant to you mastering the
topic in question, I will omit it, and you’ll just have to trust me that it’s for the best.
11
Leibniz also coined the term
function, which is commonly
learned in an elementary alge-
bra class. However, most of
Leibniz’s discoveries and innova-
tions were eclipsed by Newton,
who made great strides in the
topics of gravity, motion, and
optics (among other things). The
two men were bitter rivals and
were fiercely competitive against
each other.

If you are an aspiring calculus student, somewhere in your past you probably
had to do battle with the beast called algebra. Not many people have positive
memories associated with their algebraic experiences, and I am no different.
Forget the fact that I was a math major, a calculus teacher, and even took my
calculator to bed with me when I was young (a true but very sad story). I
hated algebra for many reasons, not the least of which was that I felt I could
never keep up with it. Every time I seemed to understand algebra, we’d be
moving on to a new topic much harder than the last.
Being an algebra student is just like fighting Mike Tyson. Here is this cham-
pion of mathematical reasoning that has stood unchallenged for hundreds of
years, and you’re in the ring going toe-to-toe with it. You never really reach
back for that knockout punch because you’re too busy fending off your oppo-
nent’s blows. When the bell rings to signal the end of the fight, all you can
think is “I survived!” and hope that someone can carry you out of the ring.

Perhaps you didn’t hate algebra as much as I did. You might be one of those lucky people
who understood algebra easily. You are very lucky. For the rest of us, however, there is
hope. Algebra is much easier in retrospect than when you were first being pummeled by
it. As calculus is a grand extension of algebra, you will, of course, need a large repertoire
of algebra skills. So it’s time to slip those old boxing gloves back on and go a few rounds
with your old sparring partner. The good news is you’ve undoubtedly gotten stronger
since the last bout. If, however, a brief algebra review is not enough for you, pick up this
book’s prequel, The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Algebra, by yours truly.
Walk the Line: Linear Equations
Graphs play a large role in calculus, and the simplest of graphs, the line, surprisingly pops
up all the time. As such, it is important that you can recognize, write, and analyze graphs
and equations of lines. To begin, remember that a line’s equation always has three compo-
nents: two variable terms and a constant (numeric) term. One of the most common ways
to write an equation is in standard form.
Common Forms of Linear Equations
A line in standard form looks like this: Ax + By = C. In other words, the variable terms are
on the left side and the number is on the right side of the equal sign. Also, to officially be
in standard form, the coefficients (A, B, and C) must be integers, and A is supposed to be
positive. What’s the purpose of standard form? A linear
equation can have many different forms (for example, x
+ y = 2 is the same line as x = 2 – y). However, once in
standard form, all lines with the same graph have the
exact same equation. Therefore, standard form is espe-
cially handy for instructors; they’ll often ask that
answers be put into standard form to avoid alternate
correct answers.
14
There are two major ways to create the equation of a line. One requires that you have the
slope and the y-intercept of the line. Appropriately enough, it is called slope-intercept
form: y = mx + b. In this equation, m represents the slope and b the y-intercept. Notice the
major characteristic of an equation in slope-intercept form: it is solved for y. In other
words, y appears by itself on the left side of the equation.
An integer is a number without a
decimal or fractional part. For
example, 3 and –6 are integers,
whereas 10.3 and –
are not.
Problem 1: Put the following linear equation into standard form: 
3x – 4y – 1 = 9x + 5y – 12
You’ve Got Problems

Chapter 2: Polish Up Your Algebra Skills
Example 1: Write the equation of a line with slope –3 and y-intercept 5.
Solution: In slope intercept form, m = –3 and b = 5, so plug those into the slope-intercept
formula: 
y = mx + b
y = –3x + 5
Another way to create a linear equation requires a little less information—only a point
and the slope (the point doesn’t have to be the y-intercept). This (thanks to the vast cre-
ativity of mathematicians) is called point-slope form. Given the point (x1, y1) and slope m,
the equation of the resulting line will be y – y1 = m(x – x1).
You will find this form extremely handy throughout the rest of your travels with calculus,
so make sure you understand it. Don’t get confused between the x’s and x1’s or the y’s and
the y1’s. The variables with the subscript represent the coordinates of the point you’re
given. Don’t replace the other x and y with anything—these variables are left in your final
answer. Watch how easy this is.
Example 2: If a line g contains the point (–5,2) and has slope – , what is the equation of
g in standard form?
Solution: Because you are given a slope and a point (which is not the y-intercept) you
should use point-slope form to create the equation of the line. Therefore, 
, 
x1 = –5, and y1 = 2. Plug these values into point-slope form and get:
15
If this equation is supposed to be in standard form, you’re not allowed to have any frac-
tions. Remember that the coefficients have to be integers, so to get rid of the fractions,
multiply the entire equation by 5:
Now, move the variables to the left and the constants to the right and make sure the x
term is positive; this puts everything in standard form:

Part 1: The Roots of Calculus
Calculating Slope
You might have noticed that both of the ways we use to create lines absolutely require
that you know the slope of the line. The slope of the line is that important (almost as
important as wearing both shoes and a shirt if you want to buy a Slurpee at 7-Eleven).
The slope of a line is a number that describes precisely how “slanty” that line is—the
larger the value of the slope, the steeper the line. Furthermore, the sign of the slope (in
most cases Capricorn) will tell you whether or not the line rises or falls as it travels.
As shown in Figure 2.1, lines with shallower inclines have smaller slopes. If the line rises
(from left to right), the slope is positive; if, however, it falls from left to right, the slope is
negative. Horizontal lines have 0 slope (neither positive nor negative), and vertical lines
are said to have an undefined slope, or no slope at all.
16

slope = 0
It is very easy to calculate the slope of any line: find any two points on the line, (a,b) and
(c,d), and plug them into this formula:
Problem 2: Find the equation of the line through point (0,–2) with slope 
and put it in
standard form.

Chapter 2: Polish Up Your Algebra Skills
In essence, you are finding the difference in the y’s and dividing by the difference in the
x’s. If the numerator is larger, the y’s are changing faster, and the line is getting steeper.
On the other hand, if the denominator is larger, the line is moving more quickly to the
left or right than up and down, creating a shallow incline.
17
You should also remember that parallel lines have equal slopes, whereas perpendicular 
lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals of one another. Therefore, if line g has slope ,
then a parallel line h would have slope 
also; a perpendicular line k would have slope –
.
We use this information in the next example.
Example 3: Find the equation of line j given that it is parallel to the line 2x – y = 6 and
contains the point (–1,1); write j in slope-intercept form.
Solution: This problem requires you to create the equation of a line, and you’ll find that
the best way to do this every time is via point-slope form. So you need a point and a slope.
Well, you already have the point: (–1,1). Using your keen sense of deduction, you know
that only the slope is left to find and that’ll be that. But how to find the slope? If j is paral-
lel to 2x – y = 6, then the lines must have the same slope, so what’s the slope of 2x – y = 6?
Here’s the key: if you solve it for y, it will be in slope-intercept form, and the slope, m, is
simply the coefficient of x. When you do so, you get y = 2x – 6. Therefore, the slope of
both lines is 2, and you can use point-slope form to write the equation of j:
Solve for y to put the equation in slope-intercept form:
y = 2x + 3
You’ve Got the Power: Exponential Rules
I find that exponents are the bane of many calculus students. Whether they never learned
exponents well in the first place or simply make careless mistakes, exponential errors are a

treasure trove of frustration. Therefore, it’s worth your while to spend a few minutes and
refresh yourself on the major exponential rules. You may find this exercise “empowering.”
If so, call and tell Oprah, because it might earn me a guest spot on her show.
◆Rule one: xa ⋅xb = xa+b
Explanation: If you multiply two terms with the same base (here it’s x), add the powers and
keep the base. For example, a2 ⋅a7 = a9.
◆Rule two: 
Explanation: This is the opposite of rule one. If you divide (instead of multiply) two terms
with the same base, then you subtract (instead of add) the powers and keep the base. For
example, 
.
◆Rule three: 
Explanation: A negative exponent indicates that a variable is in the wrong spot, and
belongs in the opposite part of the fraction, but it only affects the variable it’s touching.
For example, in the expression 
, only the y is
raised to a negative power, so it needs to be in the
opposite part of the fraction. Correctly simplified, that
fraction looks like this: 
. Note that the exponent
becomes positive when it moves to the right place.
Remember that a happy (positive) exponent is where 
it belongs in a fraction.
◆Rule four: (xa)b = xab
Explanation: If an exponential expression is raised to a
power, you should multiply the exponents and keep the
base. For example, (h7)3 = h21.
◆Rule five:
Explanation: The numerator of the fractional power remains the exponent. The denomi-
nator of the power tells you what sort of radical (square root, cube root, etc.). For 
example, 43/2 can be simplified as either 
or 
. Either way, the answer is 8.

Example 4: Simplify xy1/3(x2y)3.
Solution: Your first step should be to raise (x2y) to the third power. You have to use rule
four twice (the current exponent of y is understood to be 1 if it is not written). This gives
you x2⋅3y1⋅3 = x6y3. The problem now looks like this:

Breaking Up Is Hard to Do: Factoring Polynomials
Factoring is one of those things you see over and over and over again in algebra. I have
found that even among my students who disliked math, factoring was popular … it’s
something that some people just “got,” even when most everything else escaped them.
This is not the case, however, in many European schools, a fact that surprised my col-
leagues and me when I was a high school teacher.
Canadian exchange students gave me blank
stares when we discussed factoring in class.
This is not to say that these students were not
extremely intelligent (which they were); they just
used other methods. However, factoring does
come in very handy throughout calculus, so I
deem it important enough to earn it some time
here. Call it patriotism.
Calculus does not require that you factor complicated things, so we’ll stick to the basics
here. Factoring is basically reverse multiplying—undoing the process of multiplication to
see what was there to begin with. For example, you can break down the number 6 into
factors of 3 and 2, since 3 ⋅2 = 6. There can be more than one correct way to factor some-
thing.
Problem 4: Simplify the expression (3x–3y2)2 using exponential rules.
You’ve Got Problems
Factoring is the process of
“unmultiplying,” breaking a num-
ber or expression down into
parts that, if multiplied together,
return the original quantity.

Part 1: The Roots of Calculus
Greatest Common Factors
Factoring using the greatest common factor is the easiest method of factoring and is used
whenever you see terms that have pieces in common. This is much easier than it sounds.
Take, for example, the expression 4x + 8.
Notice that both terms can be divided by 4, making 4 a common factor. Therefore, you
can write the expression in the factored form of 4(x + 2).
In effect, I have “pulled out” the common factor of 4, and what’s left behind are the terms
once 4 has been divided out of each. In these type of problems, you should ask yourself,
“What do each of the terms have in common?” and then pull that greatest common factor
out of each to write your answer in factored form.
20
Special Factoring Patterns
You should feel comfortable factoring trinomials such as x2 + 5x + 4 using whatever
method suits you. Most people play with binomial pairs until they stumble across some-
thing that works, in this case (x + 4)(x + 1), whereas others undergo more complicated
means. Regardless of your personal “flair,” there are some patterns that you should have
memorized:
◆Difference of perfect squares: a2 – b2 = (a + b)(a – b)
Explanation: A perfect square is a number like 16, which can be created by multiplying
something times itself. In the case of 16, that something is 4, since 4 times itself is 16. If
you see one perfect square being subtracted from another, you can automatically factor it
using the pattern above. For example, x2 – 25 is a difference of x2 and 25, and both are
perfect squares. Thus, it can be factored as (x + 5)(x – 5).
◆Sum of perfect cubes: a3 + b3 = (a + b)(a2 – ab + b2)
Explanation: Perfect cubes are similar to perfect squares.
The number 125 is a perfect cube because 5 ⋅5 ⋅5 = 125.
This pattern is a little clumsier to memorize, but it can
be handy occasionally. This formula can be altered just
slightly to factor the difference of perfect cubes, as illus-
trated in the next bullet. Other than a couple of sign
changes, the process is the same.
Problem 5: Factor the expression 7x2y – 21xy3.

You cannot factor the sum of
perfect squares, so whereas
x2 – 4 is factorable, x2 + 4 is not!

Chapter 2: Polish Up Your Algebra Skills
◆Difference of perfect cubes: a3 – b3 = (a – b)(a2 + ab + b2)
Explanation: Enough with the symbols for these formulas—let’s do an example.
Example 5: Factor x3 – 27 using the difference of perfect cubes factoring pattern.
Solution: Note that x is a perfect cube since x ⋅x ⋅x = x3, and 27 is also, since 
3 ⋅3 ⋅3 = 27. Therefore, x3 – 27 corresponds to a3 – b3 in the formula, making 
a = x and b = 3. Now, all that’s left to do is plug a and b into the formula:
21
You cannot factor (x2 + 3x + 9) any further, so you are finished.
Solving Quadratic Equations
Before you put algebra review in the rearview mirror, there’s one last stop. Sure, you’ve
been able to solve equations like x + 9 = 12 forever, but when the equations get a little
trickier, maybe you get a little panicky. Forgetting how to solve quadratic equations (equa-
tions whose highest exponent is a 2) has distinct symptoms: dizziness, shortness of breath,
nausea, and loss of appetite. To fight this ailment, take the following 3 tablespoons of
quadratic problem solving and call me in the morning.
Every quadratic equation can be solved with the quadratic formula (method three, which
follows), but it’s important that you know the other two methods as well. Factoring is un-
doubtedly the fastest of the three methods, so you should definitely try it first. Few people
choose completing the square as their first option, but it (like the quadratic formula) works
every time, though it has a few more steps than its counterpart. However, you have to
learn completing the square, because it pops up later in calculus, when you least expect it.
Method One: Factoring
To begin, set your quadratic equation equal to 0; this means add and subtract the terms 
as necessary to get them all to one side of the equation. If the resulting equation is factor-
able, factor it and set each individual term equal to 0. These little baby equations will give
you the solutions to the equation. That’s all there is to it.
Problem 6: Factor the expression 8x3 + 343.
You’ve Got Problems

Part 1: The Roots of Calculus
Example 6: Solve the equation 3x2 + 4x = –1 by factoring.
Solution: Always start the factoring method by setting the equation equal to 0. In this
case, start by adding 1 to each side of the equation: 3x2 + 4x + 1 = 0.
Now, factor the equation and set each factor equal to 0. This creates two cute little mini-
equations that need to be solved, giving you the final answer:
22
This equation has two solutions: 
or x = –1. You can check them by plugging
each separately into the original equation, and you’ll find that the result is true.
Method Two: Completing the Square
As I mentioned earlier, this method is a little trickier than the other two, but you really do
need to learn it now, or you’ll be coming back to figure it out later. I’ve learned that it’s
best to learn this method in the context of an example, so let’s go to it.
Example 7: Solve the equation 2x2 + 12x – 18 = 0 by completing the square.
Solution: In this method, unlike factoring, you want the constant separate from the vari-
able terms, so move the constant to the right side of the equation by adding 18 to both
sides:
2x2 + 12x = 18
This is important: For completing the square to work,
the coefficient of x2 must be 1. In this case, it is 2, so to
eliminate that pesky coefficient, divide every term in the
equation by 2:
Here’s the key to completing the square: Take half
of the coefficient of the x term, square it, and add
it to both sides. In this problem, the x coefficient
is 6, so take half of it (3) and square that (32 = 9).
Add the result (9) to both sides of the equation:
   
   
   
   
If you don’t make the coeffi-
cient of the x2 term 1, then
the rest of the completing the
square process will not work.
Also, when you divide to elimi-
nate the x2 coefficient, make sure
you divide every term in the
equation (including the constant,
sitting dejectedly on the other
side of the equation).
Kelley’s Cautions

Chapter 2: Polish Up Your Algebra Skills
At this point, if you’ve done everything correctly, the left side of the equation will be fac-
torable. In fact, it will be a perfect square!
23
To solve the equation, take the square root of both sides. That will cancel out the expo-
nent. Whenever you do this, you have to add a ± sign in front of the right side of the
equation. This is always done when square rooting both sides of any equation:
To solve for x, subtract 3 from each side, and that’s it. It would also be good form to sim-
plify 
into 
:
Method Three: The Quadratic Formula
The quadratic formula is one-stop shopping for all your quadratic equation needs. All you
have to do is make sure your equation is set equal to 0, and you’re halfway there. Your
equation will then look like this: ax2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are the coefficients as
indicated. Take those numbers and plug them straight into this formula (which you should
definitely memorize):
You’ll get the same answer you would achieve by completing the square. Just to convince
you that the answer’s the same, we’ll do the problem in Example 7 again, but this time
with the quadratic formula.

Part 1: The Roots of Calculus
Example 8: Solve the equation 2x2 + 12x – 18 = 0, this time using the quadratic formula.
Solution: Because the equation is already set equal to 0, it is in form ax2 + bx + c = 0, and
a = 2, b = 12, and c = –18. Plug these values into the quadratic formula and simplify:
24
So although there are fewer steps to the quadratic formula, there is some room for error
during computation. You should practice both methods, but primarily use the one that
feels more comfortable to you.

◆When is an equation a function?
◆Important function properties
◆Building your function skills repertoire
◆The basics of parametric equations
I still remember the fateful day in Algebra I when the equation y = 3x + 2
became f(x) = 3x + 2. The dreaded function! At the time, I didn’t quite under-
stand why we had to make the switch. I was a fan of the y, and was sad to see
it go. What I failed to grasp was that the advent of the function marked a new
step forward in my math career.
If you know that an equation is also a function, it guarantees that the equation
in question will always behave in a certain way. Most of the definitions in cal-
culus require functions in order to operate correctly. Therefore, the vast
majority of our work in calculus will be with functions exclusively, with the
exception of parametric equations. So it’s good to know exactly what a func-
tion is, to be able to recognize important functions at a glance, and to be able
to perform basic function operations.
Chapter

Part 1: The Roots of Calculus
What Makes a Function Tick?
Let’s get a little vocabulary straight before we get too far. Any sort of equation in mathe-
matics is classified as a relation, as the equation describes a specific way that the variables
and numbers in the equation are related. Relations don’t have to be equations, although
that is how they are most commonly written.
Here’s the most basic definition of a relation. You’ll
notice that there’s not a whole lot to it, just a list of
ordered pairs:
s:{(–1,5),(1,6),(2,4)}
This relation, called s, gives a list of inputs and outputs.
In essence, you’re asking s, “What will you give me if I
give you –1?” The reply is 5, since the ordered pair
(–1,5) appears in the relation. If you input 2, s spits
back 4. However, if you input 6, s has no response; the
only inputs s accepts are –1, 1, and 2, and the only out-
puts it can offer are 5, 6, and 4.
In calculus, it is more useful to write relations like this:
This relation, called g, accepts any real number input. To find out the output g gives, you
plug the input into the x slot. For example, if I input x = 21, the output—called g(21)—is
found as follows:
A function is a specific kind of relation. In a function, no input is allowed to give you more
than one output. When one number goes in, only one matching number is allowed to
come out. The relation g above is a function of x, because for every x you plug in, you can
only get one result. If you plug in x = 3, you will always get –2. If you did it 50 times, you
wouldn’t suddenly get 101.7 as your answer on the forty-ninth try! Every input results in
only one corresponding output. Different inputs can result in different outputs, for exam-
ple, g(3) ≠g(6). That’s okay. You just can’t get different answers when you plug in the
same initial quantity.
26
A relation is a collection of
related numbers. Most often, the
relationship between the numbers
is described by an equation,
although it can be given simply
as a list of ordered pairs. A func-
tion is a relation such that every
input has only one matching out-
put. Any function input is a part
of that function’s domain, and
any possible output for the func-
tion is part of its range.

Chapter 3: Equations, Relations, and Functions, Oh My!
The word domain is usually used to describe the set of inputs for a function. Any number
that a function accepts as an appropriate input is part of the domain. For example, in the
function s:{(–1,5),(1,6),(2,4)}, the domain is {–1,1,2}. The set of outputs to a function is
called the range. The range of s is {4,5,6}.
Enough math for a second—let’s relate this
to real life. A person’s height is a function
of time. If I ask, “How tall were you at
exactly noon today?” you could give only
one answer. You couldn’t respond “5 feet 6
inches” and “6 feet 1 inch,” unless, of
course, you lied on your driver’s license.
Sometimes you’ll plug more than a number into 
a function—you can also plug a function into
another function. This is called composition of
functions, and is not difficult to do. Simply start
by evaluating the inner function and work your
way out.
Example 1: If f(x) = 
and g(x) = x + 6, evaluate g( f (25)).
Solution: In this case, 25 is plugged into f, and that output is in turn plugged into g. 
Start in the belly of the beast and evaluate f(25). This is easy: 
. Now, plug
this result into g:
g(5) = 5 + 6 = 11
Therefore, g(f (25)) = 11.
27
Sometimes in calculus, you run across a weird entity: the piecewise-defined function. This
function is similar to Frankenstein’s monster because it is created by sewing other func-
tions together. Take a look at this messy thing:
A function does not have to
have a name, like f(x) or h(x),
to be a function. The relations
y = x2 and f(x) = x2 are
equally qualified to be functions
even though they look different.
The relation r(x) = x ± 2 is not a
function of x. Every input gives
you two outputs. For example,
r(1) = 3 and –1.
Critical Point
Problem 1: If
, g(x) = x2 + 15, and 
, evaluate h(g(f(43))).
You’ve Got Problems

Part 1: The Roots of Calculus
Don’t get confused—it’s not that hard to understand.
Basically, if you want to plug a number less than 2 into
f, you plug it into 2x + 3. For example, f(1) = 2(1) + 3 =
5. However, if your input is greater than or equal to 2,
you plug it into x – 4 to get the output. For example,
f(10) = 10 – 4 = 6. People sometimes get confused
about those restrictions (x < 2 and x ≥2). Remember
that these restrictions are on the input (x), not the out-
put, and you’ll be fine.
The last important thing you should know about functions is the vertical line test. This test
is a way to tell whether or not a given graph is the graph of a function or not. All you
have to do is draw imaginary vertical lines through the graph and note the number of
times these lines hit the graph (see Figure 3.1). If any imaginary line can be drawn
through the graph that hits it more than once, the graph cannot be a function.
28
Figure 3.1
No vertical line intersects
the graph on the left more
than once, so it is a func-
tion. However, some verti-
cal lines hit the right-hand
graph more than once, so
it cannot be a function.
Functional Symmetry
Now that you know a thing or two about functions, you should also know some of the key
classifications and buzzwords. If you throw these words around at parties, you’ll surely wow
your friends. Just think about how impressed they’d be with an offhand comment like,
“That painting really exploits y-symmetry to show us our
miniscule place in the world.” Maybe you and I don’t go
to the same sorts of parties ….
A function has symmetry if it mirrors itself with respect to
a fixed part of the coordinate plane. That sounds like a
complicated concept, but it is not. Consider, for example,
the graph of y = x2.
Notice that the graph looks exactly the same on either side of the y-axis. This function is said to
be y-symmetric. There is an easy arithmetic test for y-symmetry that doesn’t require the graph.
The vertical line test tells you
whether or not a graph is a func-
tion. If any vertical line can be
drawn through the graph that
intersects that graph more than
once, then the graph in question
cannot be a function.
A symmetric function looks like a
mirror image of itself, typically
across the x-axis, y-axis, or about
the origin.

Chapter 3: Equations, Relations, and Functions, Oh My!
Example 2: Determine whether or not the graph y = x4 – 2x2 + 1 is y-symmetric.
Solution: Replace each of the x’s with (–x) and simplify the equation:
Whenever a negative number is raised to an even power, the negative sign will be elimi-
nated. Notice that our simplified result is the same as the original equation. When this
happens, you know that the equation is, indeed, y-symmetric. (By the way, y-symmetric
functions are also classified as even functions.) In case you’d also like visual proof, check
out the graph in Figure 3.3:
29
Figure 3.2
Feast your eyes on a graph
that is symmetric about
the y-axis.
Figure 3.3
The graph of 
y = x4 – 2x2 + 1.
The other two major kinds of symmetry are x-symmetry and origin-symmetry, illustrated
by the graphs in Figure 3.4.
Figure 3.4
Two other types of symme-
try you may encounter. Note
that most x-symmetric equa-
tions are not functions, be-
cause they fail the Vertical
Line Test.
x-symmetry
origin-symmetry

Part 1: The Roots of Calculus
Very similar to y-symmetry, x-symmetry requires that the graph be identical above and
below the x-axis. The test for x-symmetry is also similar to y-symmetry, except that you
plug in (–y) for the y’s instead of (–x) for the x’s. Again, if the equation reverts back to its
original form when simplifying is over, then the equation is x-symmetric. If even one sign
is different, then the equation is not x-symmetric.
Origin-symmetry is achieved when the graph does exactly the opposite thing on either
side of the origin. In Figure 3.4, notice that the origin-symmetric curve snakes down and
to the right as x gets more positive, and up and to the left as x gets more negative. In fact,
every turn in the second quadrant is matched and inverted in the fourth quadrant. To test
an equation for origin-symmetry, replace all x’s with (–x) and all y’s with (–y). Once again,
if the simplified equation matches your original equation, then that function is origin-
symmetric. By the way, if a function is origin-symmetric, you can also classify it as an odd
function.

Graphs to Know by Heart
During your study of calculus, you’ll see certain graphs over and over again. Because of
this, it’s important to know them intuitively. You’re already familiar with these functions,
but make sure you know their graphs intimately, and it will save you time and frustration
in the long run. Tell that someone special in your life that they can no longer possess your
whole heart—they’re going to have to share it with some math graphs. If they don’t
understand your needs, it wasn’t meant to be for the two of you.

Constructing an Inverse Function
You have used inverse functions forever without even realizing it. They are the tools you
break out to eliminate something unwanted in an equation. For example, how would you
solve the equation x2 = 9? To solve for x, you would take the square root of both sides to
eliminate the squared term. This works because 
and y = x2 are inverse functions.
Mathematically speaking, f and g are inverse functions if …
f(g(x)) = g(f (x)) = x
In other words, plugging g into f and f into g leaves behind no trace of the function (not
even forensic evidence), only x. Let’s go back to 
and y = x2 for a second and show
mathematically that they are inverse functions. If we plug these functions into each other,
they will cancel out, leaving only x behind:

Part 1: The Roots of Calculus
Inverse functions have special notation. The inverse to a function f(x) is written as f –1(x).
This does not mean “f to the –1 power.” It is read “the inverse of f ” or “f inverse.” I know
the notation is a little confusing, since a negative exponent usually means that the indi-
cated piece belongs in a different part of the fraction.
Now for some good news. It is very easy to create an inverse function. The word “easy” is
usually very misleading when used by math teachers. In fact, whenever I qualified a class
discussion with “Now, this is easy …,” the students knew that it was going to be anything
but. However, I wouldn’t lie to you, would I? You decide as you read the next example.
Example 3: If
, find g–1(x).
Solution: For starters, replace the function notation g(x) with y:
Here’s the key step: Reverse the x and y. In essence, this is what an inverse function
does—it turns a function inside out so that the result has the spiffy property of canceling
out the initial equation:
Your goal now is to solve this equation for y, and you’ll be done. In this problem, that
means squaring both sides of the equation:
x2 = 2y + 5
Now, subtract 5 from both sides and divide by 2 to finish solving for y:
That is the inverse function. To finish, write it in proper inverse function notation:

Parametric Equations
With all this talk about functions, you might be leery of nonfunctions. Don’t get all
closed-minded on me. You can use something called parametric equations to express graphs,
too, and they have the unique ability to represent nonfunctions (like circles) very easily.
Parametric equations are pairs of equations, usually in the form of “x =” and “y =”, that
define points of the graph in terms of yet another variable, usually t.
What’s a Parameter?
That definition’s quite a mouthful, I know. To
get a better understanding, let’s look at an exam-
ple of parametric equations:
x = t + 1
y = t – 2
These two equations together produce one graph. To find that graph, you have to substi-
tute a spectrum of things for the parameter t; each time you make a t substitution, you’ll
get a point on the graph. So a parameter is just a variable into which you plug numeric
values to find coordinates on a parametric equation graph. For example, if you plug t = 1
into the equations, you get the following:
x = t + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2
y = t – 2 = 1 – 2 = –1
Therefore, the point (2,–1) is on the graph. To get another point, I’ll plug in t = –2, but
you can actually plug in any real number for t:
x = –2 + 1 = –1
y = –2 – 2 = –4
A second point on the graph is (–1,–4). You can see that this process takes a while. In fact,
it seems like only an infinite number of t-values will get you the exact graph.
Converting to Rectangular Form
Let’s be honest, no one wants to plug in an infinite number of points. Even if you had the
time to do that, you could definitely find something better to do. Therefore, it behooves

gular form. In the next example, we’ll translate that set of parametric equations into some-
thing more manageable.
Example 4: Translate the parametric equations x = t + 1, y = t – 2 into rectangular form.
Solution: Begin by solving one of the equations for t. They’re both pretty basic, so it
doesn’t matter which you choose. I’ll pick the x equation so my result is in the form 
“y = ”. That makes it easier to graph:
x = t + 1
t = x – 1
Now you have t in terms of x. Therefore, you can replace the t in the y equation with 
(x – 1), since you know that t = x – 1:
y = t – 2
y = (x – 1) – 2
y = x – 3
This is just a line in slope-intercept form, so our parametric equations’ graph is the line
with slope 1 and y-intercept –3; it’s graphed in Figure 3.6.

have marched from door to door, sacks in hand, chiming, “Trig or Treat!” In
response, homeowners would reward them with small protractors and com-
passes to avoid the wrath of neighborhood pranksters. If all the children went
away happy, it was a good “sine” for harvest. However, this myth is definitely
untrue, and I have gone off on a tangent.

Part 1: The Roots of Calculus
Getting Repetitive: Periodic Functions
There are six major trigonometric functions, at least three of which you have probably
heard: sine, cosine, and tangent. All of the trigonometric functions (even those that are
offended because you haven’t heard of them) are periodic functions. A periodic function has
the unique characteristic that it repeats itself after some
fixed period of time. Think of the rising of the sun as a
periodic function—every 24 hours (a fixed amount of
time) the sun appears on the horizon.
The amount of horizontal space it takes until the func-
tion repeats itself is called the period. For the most basic
trigonometric functions (sine and cosine), the period is
2π. Look at the graph in Figure 4.1 of one period of 
y = sin x.
38
Figure 4.1
One period of y = sin x.
The graph of the sine function is a wave, reaching a maximum height of 1 and a minimum
height of –1. On the piece of the graph shown above, the maximum height is reached at
and 
. The distance between these two points, where the graph repeats its 
value, is 2π. If that doesn’t help you understand what is meant by period, consider the
darkened portion of the graph.
This piece begins at the origin (0,0) and wiggles up and down, returning to a height of 0
when x = 2π. True, the graph hits a height of 0, repeating its value, when x = π, but it 
hasn’t completed its period yet—that is only finished 
at x = 2π.
If you were to extend the graph of the sine function
infinitely right and left, it would redraw itself every 2π.
Because of this property of periodic functions, you can
list an infinite number of inputs that have identical sine
values. These are called coterminal angles, and the next
example focuses on them.
A periodic function’s values
repeat over and over, at the
same rate and at the same inter-
vals in time. The length of the
horizontal interval after which 
the function repeats is called the
period.
Coterminal angles have the
same function value, because the
space between them is a multiple
of the function’s period.

Chapter 4: Trigonometry: Last Stop Before Calculus
Example 1: List two additional angles (one positive and one negative) that have the same
sine value as 
.
Solution: We know that sine repeats itself every 2π, so exactly 2π further up and down
the x-axis from 
, the value will be the same. To find these values, simply add 2π to
in
order to get one and subtract 2π from
to get the other. In order to add and subtract the
values, you’ll have to get common denominators:
Therefore, the angles 
and –
are coterminal to 
and 
.
Introducing the Trigonometric Functions
Time to meet the cast. There are six players in the drama we call trigonometry. You’ll see
a graph of each and learn a little something about the function. Whereas it’s not extremely
important to memorize the graphs of these functions, it’s good to see how the graphs
illustrate the functions’ properties. So, here they are, in roughly the order of importance
to you in your quest for calculus.
Sine (Written as y = sin x)
The sine function is defined for all real numbers, and this unrestricted domain makes the
function very trustworthy and versatile (see Figure 4.2). The range is –1 ≤y ≤1, so all sine
values fall within those boundaries. Notice that the sine function has a value of 0 when-
ever the input is a multiple of π. Sometimes, people get confused when memorizing unit
circle values (more on the unit circle later in this chapter). If you remember the graph of
sine, you can easily remember that sin 0 = sin π = sin 2π = 0, because that’s where the
graph crosses the x-axis. The period of the sine function is 2π.
Cosine (Written as y = cos x)
Cosine is the “cofunction” of sine (see Figure 4.3). (In other words, their names are the
same, except one has a “co-” prefix, but I bet you figured that out.) As such, it looks very
similar, possessing the same domain, range, and period. In fact, if you shift the entire
graph of y = cos x a total of 
radians to the right, you get the graph of y = sin x! The
cosine has a value of 0 at all the “half-π’s,” such as 
and 
.
39
Unless I specifically indicate other-
wise, assume all angles in this
book are measured in radians.

Part 1: The Roots of Calculus
Tangent (Written as y = tan x)
The tangent is defined as the quotient of the previous two functions: 
. Thus, to
40

evaluate tan 
, you’d actually evaluate 
(which will equal 1 for those of you who are
curious, but more about that later). Because the cosine appears in the denominator, the
tangent will be undefined whenever the cosine equals 0, which (according to the last sec-
tion) is at the half-π’s (see Figure 4.4). Notice that the graph of the tangent has vertical
asymptotes at these values. The tangent equals 0 at each midpoint between the asymptotes.
The domain of the tangent excludes the “half-π’s,” 
, but the range is
all real numbers. The period of the tangent is π—notice that there’s a full copy of one tan-
gent period between –
and 
.
Throughout this book, I will refer to and evaluate trigonometric values in terms of radi-
ans, as they are used far more prevalently than degrees in calculus. Both degrees
and radians are simply alternate ways to measure angles, just as Celsius and
Fahrenheit are alternate ways to measure temperature. To get a rough idea of the
conversion, remember that π radians = 180 degrees. If you want to convert from radi-
ans to degrees, multiply by 
. For example,
is equivalent to
degrees. To convert from degrees to radians, multiply by 
.

Chapter 4: Trigonometry: Last Stop Before Calculus
Cotangent (Written as y = cot x)
The cofunction of tangent, cotangent, is the spitting image of tangent, with a few excep-
tions (see Figure 4.5). It, too, is defined by a quotient: 
. In fact, the cotangent is
technically the reciprocal of the tangent, so you can also write 
. Therefore, 
41
Figure 4.3
y = cos x.
Figure 4.4
y = tan x.
An asymptote is a line representing an unattainable value that shapes a graph.
Because the graph cannot achieve the value, the graph typically bends toward that line
forever and ever, yearning, reaching, stretching, but unable to reach it. A vertical
asymptote typically indicates the presence of 0 in the denominator of a fraction. For
example, the vertical line x = 
is a vertical asymptote of y = tan x because the tangent
has 0 in the denominator whenever x = 
.

Part 1: The Roots of Calculus
this function is undefined whenever sin x = 0, which occurs at all the multiples of 
π: {…, –2π,–π,0,π,2π,…}, so the domain includes all real numbers except that set. The
range, like that of the tangent, is all real numbers, and the period, π, also matches 
tangent’s.
42
Figure 4.5
y = cot x.
Secant (Written as y = sec x)
The secant function is simply the reciprocal of cosine, so 
. Therefore, the graph
of the secant is undefined (has vertical asymptotes) at the same places (and for the same
reasons) as the tangent, since they both have the same denominator (see Figure 4.6).
Hence, the two functions also have the same domain.
Notice that the secant has no x-intercepts. In fact, it
doesn’t even come close to the x-axis, only venturing as
far in as 1 and –1. That’s a fascinating comparison: the
cosine has a range of –1 ≤y ≤1, but the secant has a
range of y ≤–1 or y ≥1—almost the exact opposite.
Because secant is based directly on cosine, the functions
have the same period, 2π.
The reciprocal of a fraction is the
fraction flipped upside down (for
example, the reciprocal of 
is 
). The word refliprocal helps
me remember what it means. 

Chapter 4: Trigonometry: Last Stop Before Calculus
43
Figure 4.6
y = sec x.
Cosecant (Written as y = csc x)
Very similar to its cofunction sister, this
function has the same range and period as
the secant, differing only in its domain.
Because the cosecant is defined as the
reciprocal of the sine, 
, cosecant 
will have the same domain as cotangent, as they
share the same denominator (see Figure 4.7).
In essence, four of the trig functions are based on
the other two (sine and cosine), so those two alone
are sufficient to generate values for the rest.
Example 2: If 
and
, evaluate 
tan θ and sec θ.
It’s important to know how 0 affects a fraction. If 0 appears in the denominator of a
fraction, that fraction is deemed “undefined.” It is against math law to divide by 0,
and the penalties are stiff (the same as ripping tags off of mattresses). On the other
hand, if 0 appears in the numerator of a fraction (and not the denominator, too …
that’s still not allowed), then the fraction’s value is 0, no matter how big a number is in
the denominator.
Critical Point
The cosecant is not the
reciprocal of cosine. Many
times, people pair these because
they have the same initial sound,
but it’s wrong. Similarly, the secant
is not the reciprocal of sine.

What’s Your Sine: The Unit Circle
No one expects you to be able to evaluate most trigonometric expressions off the top of
your head. If someone held a gun to my head and asked me to evaluate 
with an
accuracy of .001, I would respond by calmly lying on the ground, drawing a chalk outline

around myself, and preparing for death. I’d have no chance without a calculator or a
Rainman-like ability for calculation. Most calculus classes, however, will require you to
know certain trigonometric values without even a second thought.
These values are derived from something
called the unit circle, a circle with a radius of
length 1 that generates common cosine and
sine values. You don’t really have to know how 
to get those values (or how the unit circle works),
but you should have these values memorized.
Make flash cards, recite them with a partner, get 
a tattoo—whatever method you use to remember
things—but memorize the unit circle values in the
chart in Figure 4.8.

If you’re having trouble remembering the unit circle, look for patterns. If you absolutely
refuse to memorize these values and it’s okay with your instructor that you don’t, at the
very least keep this chart in a handy place, because you’ll find yourself consulting it often.
Now that you know the unit circle and all kinds of crazy stuff about trig functions, your
powers have increased. ( Just make sure you always use them for good, not evil.) In fact,
you are able to evaluate a lot more functions, as demonstrated by the next example.
Example 3: Find the value of

Solution: You only know the values of sine and cosine from 0 radians to 2π radians.
Clearly, 
is much too large to fit in this limited interval. However, because cosine 
is a periodic function, its values will repeat. Since cosine’s period is 2π, you can find a
The unit circle is a circle whose
radius is 1 unit that can be used
to generate the most common
values of sine and cosine. Rather
than generating them each time
you need them, it’s best to simply
memorize those common values.

coterminal angle to 
which does appear in our unit circle chart and evaluate that one
instead—the answer will be the same.
According to Example 1 in this chapter, all you have to do is add or subtract the period
(again, it is 2π for cosine) and you’ll get a coterminal angle. I am looking for a smaller
angle than 
, so I’ll subtract 2π. Don’t forget to get common denominators to subtract
correctly: 
That’s still too big (the largest 
angle I have memorized is 
), so I have to subtract
again: 
Because 
and 
are coterminal, cos 
= cos 
= 
.
46
You might be interested in how the unit circle originates and how the previous values are
derived. Here’s a quick explanation based on Figure 4.9. A unit circle is just a circle with
radius one, and we’ll center it at the origin. Now, draw a segment from the origin that 
makes a 30-degree 
angle with the positive x-axis in the first quadrant, and 
mark the point where the ray intersects the circle. The coordinates of that point are,
respectively, the cosine and sine of 
. To find the coordinates of the point, find the
lengths of the legs of the right triangle.
Incredibly Important Identities
An identity is an equation that is always true, regardless of the input. It’s easy to tell that,
according to this definition, x + 1 = 7 is not an identity, because it is only true when x = 6.
However, consider the equation 2(x – 1) + 3 = 2x + 1. If you plug in x = 0, you get 1 = 1,
which is definitely true, wouldn’t you agree? Try plugging in any real number, and you’ll
get another true statement. Thus, 2(x – 1) + 3 = 2x + 1 is an identity. 
Problem 1: Evaluate 
using a coterminal angle and the unit circle.

Chapter 4: Trigonometry: Last Stop Before Calculus
It is worth mentioning that it is a very stupid identity. You are not going to impress any-
one by showing that equation off. With only two seconds worth of work, you can simplify
the left side and show that the two sides are equal. Most math identities are much more
useful because it’s not immediately obvious that they are true. Specifically, trigonometric
identities help you rewrite equations, simplify expressions, and justify answers to equa-
tions. With this in mind, we’ll explore the most common trigonometric identities.
They’re worth memorizing if you don’t know them already.
Pythagorean Identities
The three most important of all the trig identities are the Pythagorean identities. They
are named as such because they are created with the Pythagorean theorem. Remember
that little nugget from geometry? It said that the sum of the squares of the legs of a right
triangle is equal to the square of the hypotenuse: a2 + b2 = c2. I have always called these
identities the Mama, Papa, and Baby theorems (after the Three Bears story), both for
entertainment purposes and because they have no commonly accepted names. If I were in
the company of math nerds, however, I wouldn’t use the terms. They will sneer and scowl
at you.
◆Mama theorem: cos2 x + sin2 x = 1
◆Papa theorem: 1 + tan2 x = sec2 x
◆Baby theorem: 1 + cot2 x = csc2 x

Now, let’s see how trigonometric functions and identities can make our lives easier. With a
little knowledge of trigonometry and a little bit of elbow grease, even ugly expressions can
be made beautiful.
Example 4: Simplify the trigonometric expression 
using a Pythagorean iden-
tity.
Solution: One of these terms is a fraction. You know that you must first have common
denominators in order to add fractions, so multiply the second term by 
to get his-
and-hers matching denominators of sin x:
Now that the denominators match, you can perform the addition in the numerator while
leaving the denominator alone:
Problem 2: The Mama theorem is an identity, and therefore true for every input. Show
that it is true for

Those Wizard of Oz fans out there may remember that the Scarecrow spouts a for-
mula when the Great and Powerful Oz grants him a brain. He states, “The sum of the
square roots of any two sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of
the remaining side.” This is a false statement! He was probably supposed to quote
the Pythagorean theorem, since it is one of the most recognizable theorems to the gen-
eral public, but missed it quite badly. Perhaps Oz was not so powerful after all. The Tin
Man’s string of failed marriages and the Cowardly Lion’s lack of success as a motiva-
tional speaker offer further evidence to Oz’s lackluster gift giving.
Critical Point

Chapter 4: Trigonometry: Last Stop Before Calculus
That doesn’t look any easier! Hold on a second. The numerator looks just like the Mama
theorem, and according to the Mama theorem, cos2 x + sin2 x = 1. Therefore, substitute 1
in for the numerator: 
You could stop there, but you’re on a roll! You
also know that 
= csc x, since the cosecant is 
the reciprocal of the sine. Therefore, the final
answer is csc x.
Double-Angle Formulas
These identities allow you to write trigonometric expressions containing double angles
(such as sin 2x and cos 2θ) into equivalent single-angle expressions. In other words, these
expressions eliminate a 2 coefficient inside a trigonometric expression.
◆sin 2x = 2sin x cos x (This is the simplest double-angle formula, and memorizing it
is a snap.)
◆
The cosine double-angle formulas are a little trickier—there are actually three different
things that can be substituted for cos 2x. You should choose which to substitute in based
on the rest of the problem. If there seem to be a lot of sines in the equation or expression,
use the last of the three, for example.
There isn’t a whole lot to understand about double-angle formulas. You should just be
ready to recognize them at a moment’s notice, as problems very rarely contain the warn-
ing label, “Caution: This problem will require you to know basic trig double-angle formu-
las. Keep away from eyes. May pose a choking hazard to children under 3.” Watch how
slyly these suckers slip in there.
Example 5: Factor and simplify the expres-
sion cos4 θ – sin4 θ.
Solution: This expression is the difference 
of perfect squares, so it can be factored as 
follows: (cos2 θ + sin2 θ)(cos2 θ – sin2 θ). Notice
that the left-hand quantity is equal to 1, 
49
The notation cos2 x is short-
hand notation for (cos x)2. It
wouldn’t make any sense for the
letters “cos” to be squared. The
shorthand notation is used to
avoid having to write those extra
parentheses.
Kelley’s Cautions
There are a lot of trig 
identities—not just the few in
this chapter—but you’ll use
these far more than all the rest
put together.
Critical Point

Part 1: The Roots of Calculus
according to the Mama theorem, and the right-hand quantity is equal to cos 2x, accord-
ing to our double-angle formulas. Therefore, we can substitute those values to get 
(1)(cos 2x) = cos 2x.
50
Solving Trigonometric Equations
The last really important trig skill you need to possess is the ability to solve trigonometric
equations. A word of warning: some math teachers get very bent out of shape when dis-
cussing trig equations. You will have to read the directions to these sorts of problems very
carefully to make sure to answer the exact question being asked of you.
Each of my examples will ask for the solution to the
trigonometric equation on the interval [0, 2π).
Therefore, there may be multiple answers. Some
instructors will demand that you write the specific cor-
rect answer for each equation. In other words, although
there may be many angles that solve the problem, they
only accept one answer. This answer falls within a spe-
cific range, and as long as you learn the appropriate
range for each trigonometric function, you’ll be okay.
The best approach is to ask if they’ll require answers
on a certain interval or if they expect only the answer
on the appropriate range.
Problem 3: Factor and simplify the expression 2sin x cos x – 4sin3 x cos x.
You’ve Got Problems
When intervals are specified as [0,2π), that is shorthand for 0 ≤x < 2π. The two
numbers in the notation represent the lower and higher boundaries of the acceptable
interval, and the bracket or parenthesis tells you whether that boundary is included in
the interval or not. If it’s a bracket, that boundary is included, but not so with a paren-
thesis. In interval notation, the expression x ≥7 looks like [7,∞). Because there is no
upper bound, you write infinity. If infinity is one of the boundaries, you always use a
parenthesis next to it.
Critical Point
If your instructor demands
one answer per equation,
eliminate all of your solutions
except for the one (and there will
only be one) that falls into the
appropriate range. That range is
for sine, tangent, 
and cosecant; for cosine, cotan-
gent, and secant, use the interval
of 0 ≤θ ≤π.

The procedure for solving trigonometric equations is not unlike solving regular equations.
However, the final step often requires you to remember the unit circle!
Example 6: Solve the equation cos 2x – cos x = 0 on the interval [0, 2π).
Solution: First of all, you want to eliminate the double-angle formula so that all of the
terms are single angles. Because you are replacing cos 2x, there are three options, but I
will choose the 2cos2 x – 1 option since the problem also contains another cosine term:
(2cos2 x – 1) – cos x = 0
2cos2 x – cos x – 1 = 0
Now you can factor this equation. (If you’re having trouble, think of the equation as 
2w2 – w – 1 and factor that, substituting in w = cos x when you’re finished.)
(2cos x + 1)(cos x – 1) = 0
Like any other quadratic equation solved using the factoring method, set each factor equal
to 0 and solve:
To finish, ask yourself, “When is the cosine equal to –
and when is it 1?” The question 
asks for all answers on [0, 2π), so give all the correct answers on the unit circle:
All three answers should be given.
If your instructor requires only answers on the appropriate ranges, your solutions would
be 
and x = 0. You’d throw out 
because it does not fall in the correct
cosine range of 0 ≤θ ≤π. In this case, it’s okay to have a total of two answers, since each
of the individual, smaller equations has one answer.

I have some good news and some bad news. The good news is that we’ll be
dealing with relatively easy functions for the remainder of calculus. The bad
news is that we need to mathematically define exactly what we mean by
“easy.” When math people sit down to define things, you know that theorems
are going to start flying around, and calculus is no different.
When we say “easy” functions, we really mean continuous ones. In order to
be continuous, the function can’t contain holes and isn’t allowed to have any
breaks in it. That sounds nice, but math people like their definitions more
specific (read: complicated) than that. In order to define “continuous,” we’ll
first need to design something called a “limit.” During this part of the book,
you’ll learn what a limit is, how to evaluate limits for functions, and how to
apply that to design a definition for continuity.

Take It to the Limit
In This Chapter
◆Understanding what a limit is
◆Why limits are needed
◆Approximating limits
◆One-sided and general limits
When most people look back on calculus after completing it, they wonder
why they had to learn limits at all. For some, it’s like getting all of their teeth
pulled just for the fun of it. After a brief limit discussion at the start of the
course, there are very few times that limits return, and when they do, it is only
for a brief cameo role in the topic at hand. However, limits are extremely
important in the development of calculus and in all of the major calculus tech-
niques, including differentiation, integration, and infinite series.
As I discussed in Chapter 1, limits were the key ingredient in the discovery of
calculus. They allow you to do things that ordinary math gets cranky about.
In practice, limits are many students’ first encounter with a slightly philosoph-
ical math topic, answering questions like, “Even though this function is unde-
fined at this x-value, what height did it intend to reach?” This chapter will give
you a great intuitive feel of what a limit is and what it means for a function to
have a limit; the next chapter will help you evaluate limits.
Chapter

Part 2: Laying the Foundation for Calculus
One final note: the official limit definition is called the delta-epsilon definition of limits.
It is very complex, and is based on high-level mathematics. A discussion of this rigorous
mathematical concept is not beneficial, so it is omitted here. In essence, it is possible to be
a great driver without having to understand every principle of the combustion engine.
What Is a Limit?
When I first took calculus in high school, I was hip-deep in evaluating limits via tons of dif-
ferent techniques before I realized that I had no idea what exactly I was doing, or why. I am
one of those people who needs some sort of universal understanding in a math class, some
sort of framework to visualize why I am undertaking the process at hand. Unfortunately, cal-
culus teachers are notorious for explaining how to complete a problem (outlining the steps
and rules) but not explaining what the problem means. So, for your benefit and mine, we’ll
discuss what a limit actually is before we get too nutty with the math part of things.
Let’s start with a simple function: f(x) = 2x + 5. You know that this is a line with slope 2
and y-intercept 5. If you plug x = 3 into the function, the output will be f(3) = 2 ⋅3 + 5 =
11. Very simple, everyone understands, everyone’s happy. What else does this mean, 
however? It means that the point (3,11) belongs to the relation and function I call f.
Furthermore, it means that the point (3,11) falls on the graph of f(x), as evidenced in
Figure 5.1.
56
Figure 5.1
The point (3,11) falls on
the graph of f.
All of this seems pretty obvious, but let’s change the way we talk just a little to prepare for
limits. Notice that as you get closer and closer to x = 3, the height of the graph gets closer
and closer to y = 11. In fact, if you plug x = 2.9 into f(x), you get f(2.9) = 2(2.9) + 5 = 10.8.

Chapter 5: Take It to the Limit
If you plug in x = 2.95, the output is 10.9. Inputs close to 3 give outputs close to 11, and
the closer the input is to 3, the closer the output is to 11.
Even if you didn’t know that f(3) = 11 (say for some reason you were forbidden by your
evil step-godmother, as was Cinderella), you could still figure out what it would probably
be by plugging in an insanely close number like 2.99999. I’ll save you the grunt work and
tell you that f(2.99999) = 10.99998. It’s pretty obvious that f is headed straight for the
point (3,11), and that’s what is meant by a limit.
A limit is the intended height of a function at a
given value of x, whether or not the function
actually reaches that height at the given x. In
the case of f, you know that f does reach the value
of 11 when x = 3, but that doesn’t have to be the
case for a limit to exist. Remember that a limit is
the height a function intends to reach.
Can Something Be Nothing?
You may ask, “How am I supposed to know what a function intends to do? I don’t even
know what I intend to do.” Luckily, functions are a little more predictable than people,
but more on that later. For now, let’s look at a slightly harder problem involving limits,
but before we do, let’s first discuss how a limit is written in calculus.
In our previous example, we determined that the limit, as x approaches 3, of f(x) equals
11, because the function approached a height of 11 as we plugged in x values closer and
closer to 3. As it seems with everything else, calculus has a shorthand notation for this:
This is read, “The limit, as x approaches 3, of f(x) equals 11.” The tiny 3 is the number
you’re approaching, f(x) is the function in question, and 11 is the intended height of f
at 3. Now, let’s look at a slightly more involved example.
Figure 5.2 is the graph of
.
Clearly, the domain of g cannot contain
x = –2, because that causes 0 in the denomi-
nator, and that is just plain yucky.
Notice that the graph of g has a hole at the
evil value of x = –2, but that won’t stop us. We’re
going to evaluate the limit there. Remember, the
function doesn’t actually have to exist at a certain
point for a limit to exist—the function only has to

A limit is the height a function
intends to reach at a given x

have a clear height it intends to reach. Clearly, the function has an intended height it
wishes to reach when x = –2 in the graph—there’s a gaping hole at that exact spot, in fact.

How can you evaluate 
? Just like we did in the
previous example, you’ll plug in a number insanely close
to x = –2, in this case, x = –1.99999. Again, I’ll do the
grunt work for you (you can thank me later):  
g(–1.99999) = –4.99999. Even a knucklehead like me
can see that this function intends to go to a height of –5
on the function g when x = –2. Therefore, 
,
even though the point (–2,–5) does not appear on the
graph of g(x). This is one example of a limit existing
because a function intends to go to a height despite not
actually reaching that height.
One-Sided Limits
Occasionally, a function will intend to reach two different heights at a given x, one height
as you come from the left side, and one height as you come from the right side. We can
still describe these one-sided intended heights, using left-hand and right-hand limits. To
better understand this bizarre function behavior, look at the graph of h(x) in Figure 5.3.
We will evaluate limits like
in the 
next chapter without having to
resort to the “plug in an insanely
close number” technique. In this
chapter, focus with me on the
idea of a limit, and we’ll get to
the computational part soon
enough.

Chapter 5: Take It to the Limit
This graph does something very wacky at 
x = 4: it breaks. Trace your finger along the
graph as it approaches x = 4 from the left. What
height is your finger approaching as you get 
close to (but don’t necessarily reach) x = 4? You
are approaching a height of 6. This is called the
left-hand limit and is written like this:
The little negative sign in the exponent indi-
cates that you should only be interested in
the height the graph approaches as you
travel along the graph from the left-hand
side. If you trace your finger along the other
portion of the graph, this time toward x = 4
from the right, you’ll notice that you approach
a height of 2 when you get close to x = 4. 
This is, as you may have guessed, the right-hand
limit for x = 4, and it is written as follows:
Until now, we have only spoken of a general limit (in other words, a limit that doesn’t
involve a direction, like from the right or left). Most of the time in calculus, you will
worry about general limits, but in order for general limits to exist, right- and left-hand

The graph of h(x) consists
of both pieces; a graph
like this is usually the
result of a piecewise-
defined function.
A left-hand limit is the height a
function intends to reach as you
approach the given x value from
the left; the right-hand limit is the
intended height as you approach
from the right.
To keep from confusing right-
and left-hand limits, remember
the key word: from. A left-hand
limit is the height toward which
you’re heading as you approach
the given x-value from the left,
not as you go toward the left on
the graph.

Part 2: Laying the Foundation for Calculus
limits must also be present; this we learn in the next section, which will tie together
everything we’ve discussed so far about limits. Can you feel the electricity in the air?
When Does a Limit Exist?
If you don’t understand anything else in this chapter, make sure to understand this sec-
tion. It contains the two essential characteristics of limits: when they exist and when they
don’t exist. If you’ve understood everything so far, you’re on the verge of understanding
your first major calculus topic. I’m so proud of you … I remember when you were only
this tall ….
Here’s the key to limits: In order for a limit to exist on a function f at some x value (we’ll
give it a generic name like x = c), three things must happen:
1. The left-hand limit must exist at x = c.
2. The right-hand limit must exist at x = c.
3. The left- and right-hand limits at c must be equal.
In calculus books, this is usually written like this: If
, then 
exists and is equal to the one-sided limits.
The diagram in Figure 5.4 will help illustrate the point.
60
Figure 5.4
Yet another hideous graph
called f(x). Can you spot
where the limit doesn’t
exist?
There are two interesting x-values on this graph: x = –1 and x = 6. At one of those values,
a general limit exists, and at the other, no general limit exists. Can you figure out which is
which using the above guidelines?

Chapter 5: Take It to the Limit
You’re reading ahead aren’t you? Well, stop it. Don’t read any more until you’ve actually
tried to answer the question I’ve asked you. Do it. I’m watching!
The answer:
exists and 
does not. Remember, in order for a limit to
exist, the left- and right-hand limits must exist at that point and be equal. As you approach
x = –1 from the left and right sides, each time you are heading toward a height of 5, so the
two one-sided limits exist and are equal, and we can conclude that 
(i.e., the
general limit as x approaches –1 on f(x) is equal to 5).
However, this is not the case when we approach x = 6 from the right and left. In fact,
, whereas 
. Because those one-sided limits are unequal, we say
that no general limit exists at x = 6, and that 
does not exist.
61
When Does a Limit Not Exist?
You already know of one instance in which limits don’t exist, but two other circumstances
can ruin a limit as well.
◆A general limit does not exist if the left- and right-hand limits aren’t equal.
In other words, if there is a break in the graph of a function, and the two pieces of 
the function don’t meet at an intended height, then no general limit exists there. In 
Figure 5.5, 
does not exist because the left- and right-hand limits are unequal.
◆A general limit does not exist if a function increases or decreases infinitely at a given
x-value (i.e., the function increases or decreases without bound).
In order for a general limit to exist, the function must approach some fixed numerical
height. If a function increases or decreases infinitely, then no limit exists. In Figure 5.6,
does not exist because h(x) has a vertical asymptote at x = c, causing the function
to increase without bound there. A limit must be a finite number in order to truly exist.
Visually, a limit exists if the graph does not break at that point. For the graph f(x) in
question, a break occurs at x = 6 but not x = –1, which means a limit doesn’t exist at
the break but can exist at the hole in the graph. Remember that a limit can exist even
if the function doesn’t exist there—as long as the function intended to go to a specific
height from each direction, the limit exists.

Chapter 5: Take It to the Limit
a) 
Solution: As you approach x = –4 from the
right, the function increases without bound. You
have two ways to write your answer; either say
that the limit does not exist because the function
increases infinitely, or write 
.
b) 
Solution: As you approach x = 4 from the
right and left, the function approaches a
height of 3. Therefore, the general limit
exists and is 3.
c) 
Solution: No general limit exists here because the
left-hand limit (1) does not equal the right-hand
limit (–3). 
63
This is rare, but sometimes a function will continually wiggle back and forth, never reaching
a single numeric value. If this is the case, then no general limit exists. Because this is so rare,
most calculus books give the same example when discussing this eventuality, and I will be no
different (math peer pressure is harsh, let me tell you). No general limit exists at x = 0 in
Figure 5.7 because the function never settles on any one value the closer you get to x = 0.
Example: A function f(x) is defined by the graph in Figure 5.8. Based on the graph and your
amazing knowledge of limits, evaluate the limits that follow. If no limit exists, explain why.

f(x). Mortal men may turn
to stone upon encounter-
ing its terrible visage.
If a graph has no general
limit at one of its x-values,
that does not affect any of the
other x-values. For example, in
Figure 5.7, a general limit exists
at every x-value except x = 0.
Kelley’s Cautions
Giving a limit answer of ∞or
–∞is equivalent to saying that
the limit does not exist. However,
by answering with ∞, you are
also (1) explaining why the limit
doesn’t exist, and (2) specifically
detailing whether the function
increased or decreased infinitely
there.

In This Chapter 
◆Three easy methods for finding limits
◆Limits and asymptotes
◆Finding limits at infinity
◆Trig and exponential limit theorems
Now you know what a limit is, when a limit exists, and when it doesn’t.
However, the question of how to actually evaluate limits remains. In Chap-
ter 5 we approximated limits by plugging in x values insanely close to the
number we were approaching, but that got tedious quickly. As soon as you
have to raise numbers like 2.999999 to various exponents, it becomes clear
that you either need a better way or a giant bottle of aspirin.
Good news: there are lots of better ways, and this chapter will lead you
through all of the major processes to evaluate limits and the important limit
theorems you should memorize. For those of you who were uncomfortable
with math turning a little conceptual and philosophical there for a little bit,
don’t worry—we’re back to comfortable, familiar, soft, fuzzy, and predictable
math techniques and formulas.
Chapter

Part 2: Laying the Foundation for Calculus
All of that theory you learned in the last chapter will resurface to some degree in Chap-
ter 7, when we discuss continuity of functions, so keep it fresh in your mind. A lot of our
discussion about limits will get hazy quickly when you move on to derivatives and inte-
grals as the book progresses. Make sure you come back and review these early topics often
throughout your calculus course to keep them fresh in your brain.
The Major Methods
The vast majority of limits can be evaluated by using one of three techniques: substitu-
tion, factoring, and the conjugate method. Usually, only one of these techniques will work
on a given limit problem, so you should try one method at a time until you find one that
works. Because I am efficient (understand, by that I mean extremely lazy) I always try the
easiest method first, and only move on to more complicated methods if I absolutely have
to. As such, I’ll present the methods from easiest to hardest.
Substitution Method
Prepare yourself … you’re going to weep with uncontrollable joy when I tell you this.
Many limits can be evaluated simply by plugging the x value you’re approaching into the
function. The fancy term for this is the substitution method (or the direct substitution
method).
Example 1: Evaluate 
. 
Solution: In order to evaluate the limit, simply plug the number you’re approaching (4)
in for the variable:
4
2 – 4 + 2 = 16 – 2 = 14
According to the substitution method, 
That was too easy! Just to make sure it actually worked,
let’s check the answer by looking at the graph of 
y = x2 – x + 2 in Figure 6.1.
As we approach x = 4 from either the left or the right,
the function clearly heads toward a height of 14, which,
as we know, guarantees that the general limit exists and
is 14. It worked! Huzzah!
66
When I say that the methods of
evaluating limits are listed from
easiest to hardest, I should
qualify it by saying that “hard”
is not a good word choice; none
of these methods is hard. The
number of steps increases slightly
from one method to the next, but
these methods are easy.

Chapter 6: Evaluating Limits Numerically
If every limit problem in the world could be solved using substitution, there would proba-
bly be no need for Prozac. However (and there’s always a however, isn’t there?), some-
times substitution cannot be used. In such cases, you should resort to the next method of
evaluating limits: factoring.
67

y = x2 – x + 2 to visually
verify the limit at x = 4.
Factoring Method

What kind of an answer is 
? A gross one, that’s for sure. Remember that we can’t have 
0 in the denominator of a fraction; that’s not allowed. Clearly, then, the limit is not 
, but that answer does tell us two things:
1. You must use a different method to find the limit, because …
2. … the function likely has a hole at the x value you substituted into the function.
The best alternative to substitution is the factoring method, which works just beautifully
in this case. In the next example, we’ll find this troubling limit.
Example 2: Evaluate 
using the factoring method.
Solution: To begin the factoring method, factor! It makes sense, since the numerator is
the difference of perfect squares and factors very happily:
Now both the top and bottom of the fraction contain (x + 3), so you can cancel those
terms out to get the much simpler limit expression of:
Now you can use the substitution method to finish:
–3 – 3 = –6
So, 
. 
68
Conjugate Method
If substitution and factoring don’t work, you have one last bastion of hope when evaluat-
ing limits, but this final method is very limited in its scope and power. In fact, it is only
useful for limits that contain radicals, as its power comes from the use of the conjugate.
Problem 2: Evaluate these limits using the factoring method:

Chapter 6: Evaluating Limits Numerically
The conjugate of a binomial expression (i.e., an
expression with two terms) is the same expres-
sion with the opposite middle sign. For exam-
ple, the conjugate of 
is 
.
The true power of conjugate pairs is displayed
when you multiply them together. The product of
two conjugates containing radicals will, itself, con-
tain no radical expressions! In other words, multi-
plying by a conjugate can eliminate square roots:
You should use the conjugate method whenever you have a limit problem containing radi-
cals for which substitution does not work—always try substitution first. However, if sub-
stitution results in an illegal value 
, you’ll know to employ the conjugate method,
which we’ll use to solve the next example.
Example 3: Evaluate 
.
69
Solution: If you try the substitution method, you get , indicating that you’ll need
another method to find the limit since the function probably has a hole at x = 5. The
function itself contains a radical and a number being subtracted from it—the fingerprint
of a problem needing the conjugate method. To start, multiply both the numerator and
denominator by the conjugate of the radical expression 
:
Multiply the numerators and denominators as you would any pair of binomials—i.e., 
(a + b)(c + d) = ac + ad + bc + bd—and all of the radical expressions will disappear from the
numerator. Do not actually multiply the nonconjugate pair together. You’ll see why in a second:
For our purposes, the conjugate
of a binomial expression simply
changes the sign between the
two terms to its opposite. For
example, 
and 
are 
conjugates.

Part 2: Laying the Foundation for Calculus
Here’s the neat trick: the numerator and denominator now contain the same term (x – 5)
so you can cancel that term and then finish the problem with the substitution method:
70
What If Nothing Works?
If none of the three techniques we have discussed works on the problem at hand, you’re not
out of hope. Don’t forget we have an alternative (albeit tedious, mechanical, and unexciting—
like most television sitcoms) method of finding limits. If all else fails, substitute a number
insanely close to the number for which you are evaluating, as we did in Chapter 5.
Let me also play the part of the soothsayer for a moment. For the maximum effect, read
the next sentences in a creepy, gypsy fortuneteller voice. “I see something in your future,
yes, off in the distance. A promised method, a shortcut, a new way to evaluate limits that
makes hard things easy. I’m getting a French name … L’Hôpital’s Rule, and an unlucky
number … 13. Chapter 13. Look for it in Chapter 13.”
Limits and Infinity
There is a very deep relationship between limits and infinity. At first they thought they were
“just friends,” and then one would occasionally catch the other in a sidelong glance with
eyes that spoke volumes. Without going into the long history, now they’re inseparable, and
without their storybook relationship, there’d be no vertical or horizontal asymptotes.
Problem 3: Evaluate the following limits: 
(a)

Chapter 6: Evaluating Limits Numerically
Vertical Asymptotes
You already know that a limit does not exist if a function increases or decreases infinitely,
like at a vertical asymptote. You may be wondering if it’s possible to tell if a function is
doing just that without having to draw the graph, and the answer is yes. Just like a substi-
tution result of 
typically means a hole exists on the graph, a result of 
indicates a 
vertical asymptote. To be more specific, you don’t have to get 5 in the numerator—any
nonzero number divided by 0 indicates that the function is increasing or decreasing with-
out bound, meaning no limit exists.
Example 4: At what value(s) of x does no limit exist for 
?
Solution: Begin by factoring the expression, because knowing what x values cause a 0 in
the denominator is key:
At x = –5, the function should have a hole, as substituting in that value results in 
. You
can use the factoring method to actually find that limit:
However, you’re supposed to determine where the limit doesn’t exist, so let’s look at the
other distressing x-value: x = 5. If you substitute that into f(x), you get 
. This result, any
number (other than 0) divided by 0, indicates the presence of a vertical asymptote at 
x = 5, so 
does not exist because f will either increase or decrease infinitely there.
71
If substitution results in 
, that does not guarantee that a hole exists in the function. You
can only be sure there’s a hole there if a limit exists, as was the case with x = –5 in this
example.
Once you’ve determined that x = 5 is a vertical asymptote of f (x) in Example 4, it’s
simple to determine how the function reacts to that asymptote. (In other words, does
f (x) increase or decrease without bound as you approach x = 5 from the right and
from the left?)
All you need to do is to plug an x-value slightly to the right of x = 5 into f(x), such as 
x = 5.00001. You’ll end up with f (5.00001) ≈700,000, indicating that f(x) is 
getting gigantic. Therefore, 
. Similarly, plug in a number slightly to the left of 
x = 5, such as x = 4.99999. Since

Figure 6.2
The graph of f(x) has dif-
ferent horizontal asymp-
totes as x gets infinitely
positive and negative. A
rational function won’t
look like this—it will have
(at most) one horizontal
asymptote.
This is written as follows: 
These are called limits at infinity, since you are not approaching a fixed number, as you do
with typical limits. However, the limit still exists because the function clearly intends to
reach the limiting height indicated by the horizontal asymptote, although it never actually
reaches it.
Horizontal Asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes are caused by a function’s values increasing or decreasing infinitely as
that function gets closer and closer to a fixed x-value; so, if a function has a vertical
asymptote at x = c, we can write 
. Horizontal asymptotes have a lot of
the same components, but everything is reversed.
A horizontal asymptote is the height that a function tries to, but cannot, reach as the func-
tion’s x-values get infinitely positive or negative. In Figure 6.2, f(x) approaches a height of
5 as x gets infinitely positive and a height of –1 as f(x) grows infinitely negative.
Problem 4: Determine the x–values at which 
is undefined. If possible, 
evaluate the limits as x approaches each of those values.

Chapter 6: Evaluating Limits Numerically
Evaluating limits at infinity is a bit different from evaluating standard limits; substitution,
factoring, and the conjugate methods won’t work, so you need an alternative method.
Although L’Hôpital’s Method works quite nicely, you won’t learn that until Chapter 13. 
In the meantime, you can evaluate these limits simply by comparing the highest exponents
in their numerators and denominators.
Let’s say we calculate 
, where r(x) is defined as a fraction whose numerator, n(x), 
and denominator, d(x), are simply polynomials. Compare the degrees (highest exponents)
of n(x) and d(x):
◆If the degree of the numerator is higher,
then 
or –
(i.e., there is 
no limit because the function increases
or decreases infinitely).
◆If the degree of the denominator is
higher, then 
.
◆If the degrees are equal, then 
is equal to the leading coefficient of n(x) 
divided by the leading coefficient of d(x).
These guidelines only apply to limits at infin-
ity; make sure to remember that.
Example 5: Evaluate 
.
Solution: This is a limit at infinity, so you should
compare the degrees of the numerator and denom-
inator. They are both 3, so the limit is equal to the
leading coefficient of the numerator (5) divided by
the leading coefficient of the
denominator (8), so 
. 
73
If r(x) is a rational (fractional)
function and has a horizontal
asymptote, then it is guaran-
teed that 
. In 
other words, a rational function
has the same horizontal asymp-
tote at both ends of the function.

Special Limit Theorems
The four following special limits are not special because of the warm way they make you
feel all giddy inside. By “special,” I really mean they cannot be evaluated by the means
we’ve discussed so far, but yet you’ll see them frequently and should probably memorize
them, even though that stinks. Now that we’re on the same page, so to speak, here they
are with no further ado:
◆
This is only true when you approach 0, so don’t use this formula under any other circum-
stances. The α can be any quantity.
◆
Just like the first special limit, this is only true when approaching 0. Sometimes, you’ll
also see this formula written as 
; the limit is still 0 either way.
◆
If any real number is divided by x, and we let that x get infinitely large, the result is 0.
Think about that—it makes good sense. What is 4 divided by 900 kajillion? Who knows,
but it’s definitely very, very small. So small, in fact, that it’s basically 0.
◆
This basically says that 1 plus an extremely small number, when raised to an extremely
high power, is exactly equal to Euler’s number (2.71828 …). You will see this very infre-
quently, but it’s important to recognize it when you do.
Example 6: Evaluate 
.
Solution: This is the first special limit formula, but notice that the value inside sine must
match the denominator for that formula to work; therefore, we need a 3x in the denomi-
nator instead of just x. The trick is to multiply the top and bottom by 3 (since that’s really
the same thing as multiplying by 1, you’re not changing the expression’s value):
You can evaluate the limits of the factors separately and multiply the results together for
the final answer:

Continuity
In This Chapter
◆What it means to be continuous
◆Classifying discontinuity
◆When discontinuity is removable
◆The Intermediate Value Theorem
Now that you understand and can evaluate limits, it’s time to move forward
with that knowledge. If you were to flip through any calculus textbook and
read some of the most important calculus theorems, nearly every one contains
a very significant condition: continuity. In fact, almost none of our most
important calculus conclusions (including the Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus, which sounds pretty darn important) work if the functions in ques-
tion are not continuous.
Testing for continuity on a function is very similar to testing for the existence
of limits on a function. Just as three stipulations had to be met in order for a
limit to exist at a given point (left- and right-hand limits existing and being
equal), three different stipulations must be met in order for a function to be
continuous at a point. Just as there were three major cases in which limits did
not exist, there are three major causes that force a function to be discontin-
uous.
Chapter

Part 2: Laying the Foundation for Calculus
Calculus is very handy like that—if you look hard enough, you can usually see how one
topic flows seamlessly into the next. Without limits, there’d be no continuity; without
continuity, there’d be no derivatives; without derivatives, no integrals; and without inte-
grals, no sleepless, panicked nights trying to cram for calculus tests.
What Does Continuity Look Like?
First of all, let’s set our language straight. Continuous is an adjective that describes a func-
tion meeting very specific standards. Just like the Boy Scouts have to pass small tests to
earn merit badges, there are three tests a function must pass at any given point in order to
earn the “Continuous” merit badge. 
Before we get into the nitty-gritty of the math definition, let’s approach continuity from a
visual perspective. It is easiest to determine whether or not a function is continuous by
looking at its graph. If the graph has no holes, breaks, or jumps, then we can rest assured that
the function is continuous. A continuous function is simply a nice, smooth function that can
be drawn completely without lifting your pencil. With this intuitive definition in mind, in
Figure 7.1, can you tell which of the following three functions is continuous?

h x 
Of the above functions, only h(x) can be drawn with a
single, unbroken pen stroke. The other functions are
much more unpredictable: f has an unexpected hole in
it, and g suddenly breaks without warning. Only good
old h provides a nice smooth ride from start to finish.
Function h is like the good, solid, dependable boyfriend
or girlfriend you wouldn’t be embarrassed to bring
home to Mom and Dad, and the fact that it guarantees
no unexpected breakups means peace of mind for your
emotional well-being.
A continuous function is 
like a well-built roller coaster
track—no gaps, holes, or
breaks means safe riding for its
passengers.

The Mathematical Definition of Continuity
The mathematical definition of continuity makes a lot of sense if you keep one thing in
mind: whereas limits told us where a function intended to go, continuity guarantees that
the function actually made it there. As the saying goes, “The road to hell is paved with
good intentions.” Continuity has the math-
ematical role of policeman, determining
whether or not the function followed
through with its intentions (meaning it is
continuous) or not (making the function
discontinuous). With that in mind, here is
the official definition of continuity:
A function f(x) is continuous at a point x = c
if the following three conditions are met:
◆
◆f(c) is defined
◆
In other words, the limit exists at x = c (which
means the function has an intended height); the
function exists at x = c (which means that there is
no hole there); and the limit is equal to the func-
tion value (i.e., the function’s value matches its
intended value). (By the way, if a function is con-
tinuous, you can evaluate any limit on that func-
tion using the substitution method, since the
function’s value at any point will be equal to the
limit there.)
Example 1: Show that the function:
79
A function is continuous at a
point if the limit and function
value there are equal. In other
words, the limit exists if the
intended height matches the
actual function height.
Critical Point
Many functions are guaranteed
to be continuous at each point
in their domain, including poly-
nomial, radical, exponential,
logarithmic, rational, and trigo-
nometric functions. Most of the
discontinuous functions you’ll
encounter will be due to unde-
fined spots in rational functions
and jumps due to piecewise-
defined functions. We’ll discuss
more about specific causes of
discontinuity in the next section.
Critical Point

Part 2: Laying the Foundation for Calculus
Solution: To test for continuity, you must find the limit and the function value at x = –3
(and make sure they are equal). Now, that’s one ugly function. How can you determine its
intended height (limit) at x = –3? Clearly, the top rule in this piecewise-defined function
governs the function’s value for every single x except for x = –3. When you are finding a
limit, you want to see what height is intended as you approach x = –3, not the value actu-
ally reached at x = –3, so you’ll find the limit of the larger, ugly, top rule for f. Use the
conjugate method:
The limit clearly exists when x = –3, and it is equal to 
. The first condition of continu-
ity is satisfied. Now, on to the second. According to the function’s definition, you know
that 
, so the function does exist there. Therefore, you can conclude that the 
function is continuous at x = –3, because the limit is equal to the function value there.

Chapter 7: Continuity
Types of Discontinuity
Not much happens in the life of a graph—it lives in a happy little domain, playing match-
maker to pairs of coordinates. However, there are three things that can happen over the
span of a function which change it fundamentally, making it discontinuous. Memorizing
the three major causes of discontinuity is not so important; instead, recognize exactly what
causes the function to fall short of continuity’s requirements.
Jump Discontinuity
A jump discontinuity is typically caused by a piecewise-defined function whose pieces don’t
meet neatly, leaving gaping tears in the graph large enough for an elephant, or other
tusked mammal, to walk through. Consider the function:
This graph is made up of two linear pieces, and the rule governing the function changes
when x = 0. Look at the graph of f (x) in Figure 7.2.
81
Figure 7.2
The graph of f (x) exhibits
an unhealthy dual person-
ality since it is defined by a
piecewise-defined function.
When x = 0, the graph has a tragic and unsightly break. Whereas the left-hand piece is
heading toward a height of y = 3 as you approach x = 0, the right-hand piece has a height
of y = 1 when x = 0. Does this sound familiar? It should: the left- and right-hand limits
are unequal at x = 0, so 
does not exist. This breaks the first rule requirement of
continuity, rendering f discontinuous.

Part 2: Laying the Foundation for Calculus
In the next example, you are given a piecewise-defined
function. Your goal is to shield it from the same fate as
the pitiful function f (x) above by choosing a value for the
constant c that ensures that the pieces of the graph will
meet when the defining function rule changes. Godspeed!
Example 2: Find the real number, c that makes g(x)
everywhere continuous if:
Solution: The top rule in g(x) will define the function for all numbers less than or equal
to 3, and its reign ends once x reaches that boundary. At that point, g will have reached a
height of g(3) = 3 – 2 = 1. Therefore, the next rule (x2 + c) must start at exactly that height
when x = 3, even though it is technically defined only when x > 3. That’s the key: both
pieces must reach the exact same intended height when the graph of a piecewise-defined
function changes rules. Thus, we know that:
x
2 + c = 1
when x = 3, so plug in that x value and solve for c:
3
2 + c = 1
9 + c = 1
c = –8
Thus, the second piece of g(x) must be x2 – 8 in order
for g(x) to be continuous. You can verify the solution
with the graph of g(x) (as shown in Figure 7.3)—no
jump discontinuity anywhere to be found.
82
A jump discontinuity occurs
when no general limit exists at
the given x value (because the
right- and left-hand limits exist but
are not equal).
A function is everywhere continu-
ous if it is continuous for each 
x in its domain. Since g in
Example 2 is made up of a lin-
ear piece and a quadratic piece
(both of which are always contin-
uous as polynomials), the only
place a discontinuity can occur is
at x = 3.
Problem 2: Find the value of a which makes the function h(x) everywhere continuous if:
You’ve Got Problems

Point Discontinuity
Point discontinuity occurs when a function contains a hole. Think of it this way: the func-
tion is discontinuous only because of that rascally little point, hence the name.
Consider the function 
. It is a
rational function, so it’s continuous for all points
on its domain. Hold on a second, though. The
value x = –4 is definitely not in the domain of p(x)
(look at the denominator), so p(x) will automatically
be discontinuous there. The question is: What sort
of discontinuity is present?
Classifying the discontinuity in this case is very
easy—all you have to do is to test for a limit at 
that x value. To calculate the limit, use the
factoring method:
Chapter 7: Continuity
83
Figure 7.3
The graph of g(x) is nice
and continuous now—the
pieces of the graph join
together seamlessly.
A point discontinuity occurs
when a general limit exists, but
the function value is not defined
there, breaking the second condi-
tion of continuity.
Any x-value for which a func-
tion is undefined will automati-
cally be a point of discontinuity
for the function. If a limit exists
at the point of discontinuity, then
it must be a point discontinuity.
Critical Point

Part 2: Laying the Foundation for Calculus
In conclusion, since x = –4 represents a place where p(x) is undefined, and 
, 
you know that there is a hole in the function p(x) at the point (–4,3), a point discontinuity.
Infinite/Essential Discontinuity
An infinite (or essential ) discontinuity occurs when a function neither has a limit (because
the function increases or decreases without bound) nor is it defined at the given x-value.
In other words, this type of discontinuity occurs primarily at a vertical asymptote.
It’s easy to determine which x-values cause a vertical
asymptote, if you remember the shortcut from the last
chapter: a function increases or decreases infinitely at a
given value of x if substituting that x into the expres-
sion results in a constant divided by 0. On the other
hand, a result of 
usually means that point dis-
84
continuity is at work. However, since a result of 
doesn’t guarantee that you’ve got point disconti-
nuity, you’ll need to double-check to see if the limit
exists there. We’ll do this in Example 3, in case you’re
confused.
In summary: if no general limit exists, you have jump
discontinuity; if the limit exists but the function doesn’t,
you have point discontinuity; if the limit doesn’t exist
because it is ∞or –∞, you have infinite discontinuity.
Now that you’ve got the field guide to discontinuity, let’s look at a typical problem you’ll
be given. In it, you’ll be asked either to identify where a function is continuous or, instead,
to highlight areas of discontinuity and to classify the type of discontinuity present.
Example 3: Give all x-values for which the function
is discontinuous, and classify each instance of discontinuity.
Solution: This is a rational function, so it’s guaranteed to be continuous on its entire
domain; the only points you have to inspect are where f(x) is undefined. Because f(x) is
rational, it is undefined when its denominator equals 0, and the easiest way to find those
locations is by factoring f(x):
An infinite discontinuity is
caused by a vertical asymptote.
Since the function increases or
decreases without bound, there
can be no limit, and since the
function never actually touches
the asymptote, the function is
undefined there. Thus, the pres-
ence of a vertical asymptote ruins
all the conditions necessary for
continuity to occur. Vertical
asymptotes are the home wreck-
ers of the continuity world.

Chapter 7: Continuity
Set the denominator equal to 0 to see that x = –4 and 
will be points of disconti-
nuity. Now, we need to explain what kinds of discontinuity they represent. Plug each into
f(x). Substituting x = –4 results in 
, indicating the presence of a vertical asymptote and an
infinite discontinuity. However, substituting 
into f gives you 
, which means
there is probably a hole in the function there. That’s not good enough supporting work,
however. You need to prove that there’s a hole there in order to conclude that 
represents a point discontinuity. All the proof you’ll need is to verify the presence of a
limit at 
. To do so, use the factoring method:
Because the limit exists, there is a point discontinuity when 
.
85
Removable vs. Nonremovable Discontinuity
Occasionally you’ll see a function described as having removable or nonremovable discon-
tinuity. These terms are more specific than simply stating that a function is discontinuous,
but less specific than the kinds of discontinuity we explored in the last section. In other
words, these terms are vague, whereas point, jump, and infinite discontinuity are not.
However, since these terms appear often, it’s good to know what they mean. A removable
discontinuity is one that could be eliminated by simply redefining a finite number of points.
In other words, if you can “fix” the discontinuity by filling in holes, then that discontinu-
ity is removable. Let’s go back to the function we examined in Example 3 for a moment:
Problem 3: Give all x-values for which the function 
is discontinuous, and classify each instance of discontinuity.
You’ve Got Problems

Part 2: Laying the Foundation for Calculus
This function has a point discontinuity at 
, since 
. If I redefine
86
f(x) slightly, setting 
, then the limit equals the function value when 
, 
and f(x) is continuous there. Mathematically, the new function f(x) looks like this:
You don’t actually have to change the function for it to be removably discontinuous (in
fact, if you did change the function, it wouldn’t be discontinuous when 
). How-
ever, if it is possible to change a few points in order to fill in the function’s holes, the dis-
continuities are removable.
Nonremovable discontinuity occurs when a function has no general limit at the given x-value,
as is the case with infinite and jump discontinuities. There is no way to redefine a finite
number of points to “repair” this type of discontinuity; the function is fundamentally dis-
continuous there, and no amount of rehabilitation or mood-altering medication can make
this function safe for a cultured society. I gasp at the thought, but not even a charity rock
concert can help (sorry, U2). Back to the function f(x) from Example 3 for illustration.
Since a vertical asymptote occurs at x = –4 and no general limit exists there, x = –4 
represents an instance of nonremovable discontinuity.
A function is removably discontinuous at a given x-value if a limit exists there, since you
can redefine the function to fill in the holes (and thus remove the discontinuity) if you chose
to. Therefore, point and removable discontinuity are essentially synonymous. A function
is nonremovably discontinuous at a given x-value if no general limit exists there, mak-
ing it impossible to remove the discontinuity by redefining a fixed number of points.
Jump and infinite discontinuities are both examples of nonremovable discontinuity.

Chapter 7: Continuity
The Intermediate Value Theorem
Break out the party favors—we’ve arrived at our first official calculus theorem.
The Intermediate Value Theorem: If a function f(x) is continuous on the closed interval [a,b],
then for every real number d between f(a) and f(b), there exists a c between a and b such
that f(c) = d.
Now, let me explain what the heck that means using a simple example. Like all red-
blooded Americans, I enjoy a little too much holiday dining during the winter months of
November and December. If we were to exaggerate my weight gain (a little), it might
have the following humorously titled “Date vs. Weight” graph, which I’ll call w(x) in
Figure 7.4.
87

From the graph, we can see that I weighed 180 pounds on December 1 and porked up to
191 by the time December 30 “rolled around,” poor pun definitely intended. Comparing
this to the Intermediate Value Theorem, a = Dec 1, b = Dec 30 (weird values, but go with
me on this), f(a) = w(Dec 1) = 180, and f(b) = w(Dec 30) = 191. According to the theorem,
I can choose any value between 180 and 191 (for example, 183), and I am guaranteed that
at some time between December 1 and December 30, I actually weighed that much.
The Intermediate Value Theorem does not claim to tell you where your function reaches
that value or how many times it does. The theorem simply claims (in a calm, soothing
voice) that every height a function reaches on a specific x-interval boundary will be output
at least once by some x within that interval. As it only guarantees the existence of some-
thing, it is called an existence theorem.
Problem 4: Use the Intermediate Value Theorem to explain why the function 
g(x) = x2 + 3x – 6 must have a root (x-intercept) on the closed interval [1,2].

Part 2: Laying the Foundation for Calculus
The Least You Need to Know
◆A continuous function has no holes, jumps, or breaks in its graph.
◆If a function reaches its intended height at a particular x-value, the function is con-
tinuous there.
◆If a function is undefined but possesses a limit at a given x-value, there is point dis-
continuity, which is removable.
◆Infinite discontinuity is caused by a vertical asymptote, whereas jump discontinuity
is caused by a break in the function’s graph; both are nonremovable discontinuities.
◆The Intermediate Value Theorem uses rather complex language to guarantee the
“wholeness” or “completeness” of a graph.

The Difference Quotient
In This Chapter
◆Creating a tangent from scratch
◆How limits can calculate slope
◆“Secant you shall find” the tangent line
◆Both versions of the difference quotient
Although limits are important to the development of calculus and are the only
topic we have even discussed so far, they are about to take a backseat to the
two major topics comprising what most people call “calculus”: derivatives and
integrals. It would be rude (and actually mathematically inaccurate) to simply
start talking about derivatives without describing their relationship to limits.
Brace yourself. This chapter describes the solution to one of the most puz-
zling mathematical dilemmas of all time: how to calculate the slope of a tan-
gent line to a nonlinear function. We’re going to use limits to concoct a
general formula that will allow you to find the tangent slope to a function at
any given point. The process is a little tedious and is a bit algebra-intensive.
You may ask yourself, “Am I always going to go through so much pain to find
a derivative?” The answer is no. In Chapter 9, you’ll learn lots of shortcuts to
finding derivatives.
For now, however, prepare to be dazzled. You’re about to create a tangent line
to a function and calculate its slope through a little “mathemagics.”
Chapter

Part 2: Laying the Foundation for Calculus
When a Secant Becomes a Tangent
Before we go about calculating the slope of a tangent line, you should probably know
what a tangent line is. A tangent line is a line that just barely skims across the edge of a
curve, hitting it at the point you intend. 
In Figure 8.1, you’ll see the graph of y = sin x with two of its tangent lines drawn, one at
and one at 
. Notice that the tangent lines barely skim across the edge of
the graph and hit only at one point, called the point of tangency. If you extend it, the tan-
gent line may hit the function again somewhere else along the graph, but that doesn’t
matter. What matters is that it only hits once relatively close to the point of tangency.
90
Figure 8.1
Points of tangency.
A secant line, on the other hand, is a line that crudely hacks right through a curve, usually
hitting it in at least two places. In Figure 8.2, I have drawn both a secant and a tangent
line to a function f(x) when x = 3. Notice that the dotted secant line doesn’t have the
finesse of the tangent line, which strikes only at x = 3.
Through a little trickery, we are going to make a secant line into a tangent. This is the
backbone of our procedure for calculating the slope of a tangent line. So now that you
know what the words mean, let’s get started.

Chapter 8: The Difference Quotient
Honey, I Shrunk the Δx
Take a look at the function graph in Figure 8.3
called f(x). I have marked the location x = c on the
graph. My final, overall goal will be to calculate
the slope of the tangent line to f at x = c. You may
not understand this to be a very important goal,
but trust me, it is world-shatteringly important.

line to a function f(x)

The graph of some func-
tion f(x) with location 
x = c.
A tangent line skims across the
curve, hitting it once in the indi-
cated location; however, a
secant line does not skim at all. It
cuts right through a function, usu-
ally intersecting it in multiple spots.

Part 2: Laying the Foundation for Calculus
Now, let’s add a few things to the graph to create Figure 8.4. First of all, I know the coor-
dinates of the indicated point. In order to get to that point from the origin, I have to go 
c units to the right and f(c) units up (so that I hit the function), which translates to the
coordinate pair (c,f(c)). Now let’s add another point to the graph to the right of the point
at x = c. How far to the right, you ask? Let’s be generic and call it “Δx” more to the right.
(“Δx” is math language for “the change in x,” and since we’re changing the x value of c by
going Δx more to the right, it’s a fitting name.)
92
Figure 8.4
Now appearing on the
graph of f(x), a new x
value, which is a distance
of Δx away from c.
Once again, all we’re doing is making a new point that is a horizontal distance of Δx away
from the first point. Can you figure out the coordinates of the new point? In the same
fashion that we got the first coordinate pair to be (c,f(c)), this point has coordinates 
(c + Δx, f(c + Δx)). Now connect these two points together, and what have you got? A
secant line through f, as pictured in Figure 8.5.
True, our final goal is to find the slope of the tangent line to f at x = c, but for now, we’ll
amuse ourselves by finding the slope of the secant line we’ve drawn at x = c. We know how
to calculate the slope of a line if given two points—use the procedure from Problem 3 in
Chapter 2:

Chapter 8: The Difference Quotient
So we found the slope of the secant line, and
that slope is relatively close to the slope of
the tangent line we want to find—both have
nearly the same incline. However, we don’t
want an approximation of the slope of the tan-
gent line, we want it exactly. Here’s the key: I
am going to redraw the second point on the graph
of f (remember the one that was Δx away from the
first point), and this time I am going to make Δx
smaller. Figure 8.6 shows the new, improved point
and secant line. Why is it improved? It has a slope
closer to the tangent line we’re searching for.
93
Figure 8.5
We’ve added the coordi-
nates to the new point.
Note that the secant line
connecting the points
looks a little like the dot-
ted tangent line at x = c.
It’s a little too steep, but
it’s pretty close. 
Figure 8.6
When Δx is smaller, the
new point is closer to x = c.
In addition, the (solid)
secant line looks even
more like the dotted tan-
gent line.
Here comes the connection to
limits: the smaller I make Δx, the
closer the slope of the secant
line approximates the slope of
the tangent line. I am not allowed
to make Δx = 0, because that
would mean I was dividing by 0
in the slope equation we created
a few moments ago.
Critical Point

Part 2: Laying the Foundation for Calculus
This new secant line isn’t as steep as the previous one, and it is an even better impersonator
of the actual tangent line at x = c. The funny thing is, if I were to calculate its slope, it would 
look exactly the same as the slope I came up with before: 
.
Here’s my moment of brilliance: if I make Δx infinitely small, so small that it is basically
(but not quite) 0, then the two points on the graph would be so close together that I
would, in effect, actually have the tangent line. Therefore, by calculating the secant line
slope, I’d actually be calculating the tangent line slope as well. How do I make Δx get that
small, though? It’s easy, actually, since we know limits. We’re just going to find the limit
of the secant slope function as Δx approaches 0. This limit is called the difference quotient,
and is the very definition of the derivative:
This is the most important calculus result we have dis-
cussed thus far. We now have an admittedly ugly but
very functional formula allowing us to calculate the
slope of the tangent line to a function. What’s amazing
is that we really forced it, didn’t we? We actually cre-
ated a tangent line out of thin air by forcing a secant
line to undergo radical and mind-altering changes. But
if you’re like me, you’re thinking, “Enough with the
theory already—I’ll probably never have to create the
definition of a derivative. Instead, I’d rather know how
to use the difference quotient to find a derivative.” Your
wish is my command.
94
The formula is called the differ-
ence quotient because (1) it
represents a quotient since it is
a fraction, and (2) the numera-
tor and denominator represent
the difference in the y’s and the
x’s, respectively, between the two
points on our secant line.
Critical Point
The derivative of a function f(x) at x = c is the slope of the tangent line to f at x = c. You
can find the value of the derivative using the difference quotient, which is this formula:
As you can see, I usually write the formula with x’s instead of c’s, but that doesn’t
change the way it works.

Chapter 8: The Difference Quotient
Applying the Difference Quotient
In order to find the derivative f ′(x) of the function f(x), you’ll apply the difference quo-
tient formula. To get the numerator, you’ll plug (x + Δx) into f and then subtract the origi-
nal function f(x). Then, divide that quantity
by Δx, and calculate the limit of the entire
fraction as Δx approaches 0.
Example 1: Use the difference quotient to
find the derivative of f(x) = x2 – 3x + 4, and
then evaluate f ′(2).
Solution: The difference quotient has one ugly
piece in the numerator: f(x + Δx), so let’s figure out
exactly what that is ahead of time and then plug it
into the formula. Remember, when you evaluate
f(x + Δx), you have to plug in x + Δx into all the x
terms in f. In other words, plug it into x2 and –3x:
That entire disgusting quantity must be substituted into the difference quotient for 
f(x + Δx) now, and we’ll try to simplify as much as possible:
95
The most common errors
people make when apply-
ing the difference quotient are 
(1) forgetting to subtract f(x) in
the numerator and (2) omitting
the denominator completely.
Sometimes evaluating f(x + Δx)
gets so tedious they forget the
rest of the formula.
Kelley’s Cautions

Part 2: Laying the Foundation for Calculus
You’ve got to admit—that looks a lot better than it did a
second ago. You were starting to panic, weren’t you? All
of these difference quotient problems are going to sim-
plify significantly like this. Now, how do we evaluate the
limit? Substitution is a no-go, because it results in 
, so 
we should move on to the next available technique:
factoring. That works like a charm:
Now for the second part of the problem: calculating f ′(2), the slope of the tangent line
when x = 2. It’s as easy as plugging x = 2 into the newfound derivative formula:
96
Once you find the general derivative using the difference quotient (f ′(x) = 2x – 3), you can
then calculate any specific derivative you desire (like f ′(2)). However, finding that general
derivative is not a whole lot of fun. In fact, it’s just about as fun as that time you got noth-
ing but socks and underpants for your birthday. Calculus does offer you an alternative form
of the difference quotient if you feel hatred toward this method welling up inside of you.
The Alternate Difference Quotient
I have good news and bad news for you. First, the good news: the alternate difference
quotient involves much less algebra and absolutely no Δx’s at all. But the bad news is that
it cannot find the general derivative—you can only calculate specific values of the deriva-
tive. In other words, you’ll be able to use this method to find values such as f ′(3), but you
won’t be able to find the actual derivative f ′(x). This definitely limits its usefulness, but it
is, without question, much faster than the first method once you get used to it.
There are many notations that
indicate a derivative. The most 
common are:f ′(x), y ′, and 
. 
The last two of these are
typically used when the original
function is written in “y =” form,
rather than “f(x)=” form. The sec-
ond derivative (the derivative of
the first derivative) is denoted 
f ″(x),y″, and
.

Chapter 8: The Difference Quotient
The alternate difference quotient: The derivative of f at the specific x-value x = c can be
found using the formula:
Notice the major differences between this and the previous difference quotient. For one
thing, in this limit you approach the number c, not x, at which you are finding the deriva-
tive; in the other method, Δx always approached 0. In the numerator of this formula, you
will calculate f(c), which will be a real number; in the previous formula, both pieces of the
numerator, f(x + Δx) and f(x), were functions of x. Clearly, the two formulas have different
denominators as well. Since both are limits, though, evaluating them is quite similar once
you’ve plugged in the initial values.
For grins, let’s redo the second part of Example 1, since we already know the correct
answer. You ever notice that math teachers just love doing this—reworking the same prob-
lem twice using different methods and arriving at the same answer as if by magic? I
remember doing this in class, turning around at the conclusion of the second problem,
and saying, “You see, they’re equal!” Needless to say, I was the only one impressed.
However, I still do this, hoping against hope that one day a student will faint from pure
shock and delight when the answers work out the same.
Example 2: Evaluate f ′(2) if f(x) = x2 – 3x + 4.
Solution: The formula requires us to know f(c), in this case f(2), so calculate that first:

◆The slope of the tangent line to a curve at a certain point is called the derivative at
that point.
◆There are two forms of the different quotient; both give the value of a function’s
derivative at any given x-value.
◆The original form of the difference quotient can provide the general derivative for-
mula for a function, whereas the second can only give the derivative’s value at a
specified x-value.

At the end of Part 2, you learned the basics of the difference quotient and that
it calculates something called the derivative. In the study of calculus, the
derivative is huge. Just about everything you do from here on out is going to
use derivatives to some degree. Therefore, it’s important to know exactly what
they are, when they do and don’t exist, and how to find derivatives of func-
tions.
Once you’ve got the basic skills down, you can begin to explore the huge for-
est of applications that comes along with the derivative package. Since deriva-
tives are actually rates of change, they classify and describe functions in ways
you’ll hardly believe. Have you ever wondered, “What’s the maximum area I
could enclose with a rectangular fence if one side of the rectangle is three
times more than twice the other side?” If you have, well, you scare me because
no one has thoughts like that. However, the good news is that you’ll be able
to find your answer once and for all.

One of my most memorable college professors was a kindly Korean man
named Dr. Oh. One of the reasons his class sticks out in my mind is the way
he was able to illustrate things with bizarre but poignant imagery. The day we
first discussed the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, he described it in his
usual understated way. “Today’s topic is like the day the world was created.
Yesterday, not interesting. Today, interesting!”
One of the classes I took from Dr. Oh was Differential Equations. Dr. Oh
constantly (but jokingly) harassed the young lady who sat next to me, because
she would always do things the long way. No matter what shortcuts we
learned, she wouldn’t use them. I never understood why, and she simply ex-
plained to me, “This is the way I do things …. I can’t change it now!” I
remember Dr. Oh repeatedly asking her, “If you want potatoes, do you buy a

farm, till the field, plant the seed, nurture the plants, and then harvest the potatoes? If I
were you, I would just go to the grocery store.”
In the land of derivatives, the difference quotient is the equivalent of growing your own
potatoes. Sure, the process works, but I gave you very specific examples so that it would
work for you without any trouble or heartache. I was shielding you against the harsh
weather of complicated derivatives to come. However, I have to let you grow up some-
time and stare in the face of an ugly, complicated derivative. The good news, though, is
that you can buy all your solutions from the grocery store.
When Does a Derivative Exist?
Before you run around finding derivatives willy-nilly, you should know that there are
three specific instances in which the derivative to a function fails to exist. Even if you get
a numerical answer when calculating a derivative, it’s possible that the answer is invalid,
because there actually is no derivative! Be extra cautious if the graph of your function
contains any of the following things:
Discontinuity
A derivative cannot exist at a point of discontinuity. It
doesn’t matter if the discontinuity is removable or not.
If a function is discontinuous at a specific x-value, there
cannot be a derivative there. For example, if you are
given the function …
… you know, without a bit of work, that f has no deriv-
ative at x = –2 and x = 6. In other words, f is not differ-
entiable at those values of x.
Sharp Point in the Graph
If a graph contains a sharp point (also known as a cusp), then the function has no deriva-
tive at that point. Not many functions have cusps; in fact, they are pretty rare. You’re
most likely to see them in functions containing absolute values and in piecewise-defined
functions whose pieces meet, but not smoothly. In Figure 9.1, you’ll find the graphs of the
function 
and a piecewise-defined function.
102
You’ll hear the statement
“Differentiability implies continu-
ity” in your calculus class. That
means exactly this: if a function
has a derivative at a specific x-
value, then the function must also
be continuous at that x value.
That statement is the logical
equivalent of saying, “If a func-
tion is not continuous at a certain
point, then that function is not dif-
ferentiable there either.”

Chapter 9: Laying Down the Law for Derivatives
… which both contain nondifferentiable cusps at x = 1.
103
Figure 9.1
Both graphs are pointy at 
x = 1 and, therefore, non-
differentiable there.
Vertical Tangent Line
Remember that the derivative is defined as the
slope of the tangent line. What if the tangent line
is vertical? Keep in mind that vertical lines don’t
have a slope, so a derivative cannot exist there. It’s
pretty tough to spot when this happens using only
a graph, but luckily, the mathematics of deriva-
tives is quick to expose it when it happens, as
shown in the next example.
A function is differentiable at a
given value of x if you can take
the derivative of the function at
that x value. In other words, f(x)
is differentiable at x = c if f ′(c)
exists. A function whose deriva-
tive does not exist at a specific x
value is said to be nondifferen-
tiable there.
Many modern calculators can evaluate derivatives, but they may give you incorrect
derivative values if you are trying to find the derivative at a cusp. For example, if
you differentiate h(x) = |x|, many calculators will tell you that h′(0) = 0, but we know
that h(x) has a cusp at x = 0, so there is really no derivative there at all! Therefore, take
any answer your calculator gives you with a grain of salt; it expects you to know if you
are asking it to perform an impossible task.
Kelley’s Cautions

Part 3: The Derivative
Example 1: Show that no derivative exists for the function f(x) = x1/3 when x = 0.
Solution: You don’t know how to find the derivative of f(x) = x1/3 yet (but you will soon),
so I’ll tell you that it’s 
. If you try to evaluate f(0), you get: 
The slope of the tangent line is a nonexistent number, since you can’t divide by 0. 
Basic Derivative Techniques
Learning how to find derivatives using the difference quotient can be long, tedious work,
but once you’ve mastered it, you’ve “paid your dues,” so to speak. Now, you’ll learn some
really handy techniques. Here are three derivative shortcuts that will make things a whole
lot faster and easier.
The Power Rule
Even though the Power Rule can only find very basic derivatives, you’ll definitely use it
more than any other of the rules we’ll learn. In fact, it often pops up in the final steps of
other rules, but let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Any term in the form axn can be differen-
tiated using the Power Rule.
The Power Rule: The derivative of the term axn (with respect to x), where a and n are real
numbers, is (a ⋅n)xn – 1.
104
Here are the steps you’ll use to find a derivative with the Power Rule:
1. Multiply the coefficient by the variable’s exponent. If no coefficient is stated—in
other words, the coefficient equals 1—the exponent becomes the new coefficient.
2. Subtract 1 from the exponent.
Some examples will shed some light on the matter.
Don’t worry about the phrase “with respect to x” in the Power Rule definition. Since x is
the only variable in the expression, we really don’t need to say that. In Chapter 10
we’ll differentiate implicitly, and then you’ll have to know what that actually means. For
now, just understand that the phrase “with respect to” will refer to the variable in the
problem, but won’t affect any of your derivative techniques.
Critical Point

Chapter 9: Laying Down the Law for Derivatives
Example 2: Use the Power Rule to find the derivative of 
.
Solution: Even though there are a number of terms here, you can find the derivative of
each one separately using the Power Rule. Before you start, I’ll tell you that the derivative
of the constant term (–5) is 0. (See below for an explanation.) For the other terms, multi-
ply the coefficient of each one by the exponent and then subtract 1 from the exponent:
Remember, the exponent of 6h is understood to be 1 since it’s not written explicitly, and a
variable to the zero power equals 1: 6h0 = 6 ⋅ 1 = 6.
The derivative of any constant is 0. Here is a quick justification if you are interested.
Consider the constant function g(x) = 7. If you wanted to, you could write this function
with a variable term: g(x) = 7x0. I am not changing the value of the function since a vari-
able to the 0 power has a value of 1, and 7 ⋅ 1 = 7. So now that you’ve rewritten the func-
tion, use the Power Rule:
105
The Product Rule
If a function contains two variable expressions multiplied together, you cannot simply find
the derivative of each and multiply the results. For example, the derivative of x2 ⋅(x3 – 3)
is not (2x)(3x2). Instead, you have to use a very simple formula, which (by the way) you
should memorize.
The Product Rule: If a function h(x) = f(x) ⋅g(x) is the product of two differentiable func-
tions f(x) and g(x), then
Problem 1: Find derivatives using the Power Rule:
(a)
(b)
You’ve Got Problems

Part 3: The Derivative
Here’s what that means. If a function is created by 
multiplying two other functions together, then the
derivative of the overall function is the first one times
the derivative of the second plus the second one times
the derivative of the first. 
Example 3: Differentiate f(x) = (x2 + 6) (2x – 5) using
(1) the Product Rule, and (2) the Power Rule, and
show that the results are equal. Hint: to use the Power
Rule, you’ll first have to multiply the terms together.
Solution: (1) According to the Product Rule,
(2) As the hint indicates, you need to multiply those binomials together before you can
apply the Power Rule: f(x) = 2x3 – 5x2 + 12x – 30. Now, apply the Power Rule to get 
f ′(x) = 6x2 – 10x + 12, which matches the answer from part (1).
106
The Quotient Rule
Just as the Product Rule prevents you from simply taking individual derivatives when
you’re multiplying, the Quotient Rule prevents the same for division. Every year on my
first derivatives exam, one of the problems is to find the derivative of something like 
, and half of my students always answer 
, no matter how many 
times I warn them to use the Quotient Rule. You must use the Quotient Rule any time
two variable expressions are divided.
The Quotient Rule: If 
, where f(x) and g(x) are differentiable functions,
then
.
Overlooking the Product
Rule is a very common mis-
take in calculus. Remember: If
two variable expressions are mul-
tiplied together, you have to use
the Product Rule. If, however, you
want to find the derivative of 
5 ⋅7x2, you don’t need the
Product Rule (since 5 is not a
variable expression). Instead, you
can rewrite it as 35x2 and use
the Power Rule to get the correct
derivative of 70x.
Kelley’s Cautions
Problem 2: Find the derivative of g(x) = (2x – 1)(x + 4) using (1) the Power Rule, and
(2) the Product Rule, and show that the results are the same.

Chapter 9: Laying Down the Law for Derivatives
In other words, to find the derivative of a
fraction, take the bottom times the derivative
of the top and subtract the top times the
derivative of the bottom; divide all of that by
the bottom squared. Of course, by top and bottom,
I mean numerator and denominator, respectively.
Example 4: Find the derivative of 
using
the Quotient Rule.
Solution: The numerator is f(x) in the Quotient
Rule, and the denominator is g(x): f(x) = 3x + 7 and
g(x) = x2 – 1. Therefore, f ′(x) = 3 and g′(x) = 2x.
Plug all of these values into the appropriate spots in the Quotient Rule:
107
The Chain Rule
Consider, for a moment, the functions 
and g(x) = 3x + 1. With the skills you
now possess, you could find the derivative of each using the Power Rule. You could even 
find the derivatives of their product 
or their quotient 
, using the Product
and Quotient Rules, respectively (no big surprise there). 
However, you don’t know how to find the derivative of two functions plugged into (or
“composed with”) one another. In other words, the derivative of 
requires a technique you’ve not yet learned, a technique called the Chain Rule. 
If this function were simpler, such as 
, there would be no need for the Chain
Rule, but the inner function (in this case 3x + 1) is too complicated. Here’s a good rule of
It is very important to get
the subtraction order correct
in the numerator of the Quotient
Rule. Whereas in the Product
Rule, either of the two functions
could be f or g, in the Quotient
Rule, g must be the denominator
of the function.

thumb: if a function contains something other than a single variable, like x, then you
should use the Chain Rule to find its derivative.
The Chain Rule: Given the composite function h(x) = f (g(x)), where f(x) and g(x) are differ-
entiable functions,
108
In other words, to take the derivative of an expression where one function is “trapped
inside” another function, you follow these steps:
1. Take the derivative of the “outer” function, leaving the trapped, “inner” function alone.
2. Multiply the result by the derivative of the “inner” function.
Example 5: Use the Chain Rule to find the derivative of 
.
Solution: Rewrite the function so that it’s clear what’s actually plugged into what. In this 
case, 3x + 1 is plugged into 
. In other words, if 
(the outer function) and
g(x) = 3x + 1 (the inner function since it’s trapped inside the square root symbol in f(x)),
then 
. Rewriting the function like this helps you plug everything into the
right spots in the Chain Rule formula. 
Your first step is to take the derivative of f(x), leaving g(x) alone. This just means you
should find the derivative of f(x) and, once you’re done, plug g(x) into all of its x spots.
According to the Power Rule, if f(x) = x1/2, then
Now plug g(x) in for x:
You’re almost done. The final step is to multiply this ugly monstrosity of a fraction by the
derivative of g(x). A quick nod to the Power Rule tells you that if g(x) = 3x + 1, then 
:
The derivatives of logarithmic and exponential equations use the Chain Rule 
heavily. Make sure to learn these patterns:

Rates of Change
Derivatives are so much more than what they seem. True, they give the slope of the tan-
gent line to a curve. But that slope can tell us a great deal about the curve. One character-
istic of the derivative we will exploit time and time again is this: The derivative of a curve
tells us the instantaneous rate of change of the curve. This is key, because a curvy function
changes at different rates throughout its domain—sometimes it’s increasing quickly and
the tangent line is steep (causing a high-valued derivative). At other places the curve may
be increasing shallowly or even decreasing, causing the derivative to be small or negative,
respectively. Look at the graph of f(x) in Figure 9.2.
Figure 9.2
The graph of f(x), with
three points of interest
shown.
Problem 4: Use the Chain Rule to differentiate y = (x2 + 1)5.
You’ve Got Problems
The graph of a line always changes at the exact same rate. For example, 
g(x) = 4x – 3 will always increase at a rate of 4, since that is the slope of the line
and also the derivative. Since curves are not straight, they will not always possess the
same slope for every x-value. Curves, however, do not have the same slope every-
where, so we rely on the slopes of their tangent lines. Because tangent lines vary
depending on where on the curve they are drawn, a curve will possess different rates
of change depending on where you look, as illustrated in Figure 9.2.
Critical Point

Part 3: The Derivative
At x = a, f is increasing ever so slightly, causing the tangent line there to be shallow. Since
a shallow line has a slope close to 0, the derivative here will be very small. In other words,
the rate of change of the graph is very small at the
instant that x = a. However, at the instant that x = b, the
graph is climbing more rapidly, causing a steeper tan-
gent line, which in turn causes a larger derivative.
Finally, at x = c, the graph is decreasing, so the instanta-
neous rate of change there is negative (since the slope
of the tangent line is negative).
You can also use the slope of a secant line to determine
rates of change on a graph. However, the slope of a
secant line describes something different: the average
rate of change over some portion of the graph. Finding
the slope of a secant line is very easy, as you’ll see in the
next example.
Example 6: Poteet, Inc. has just introduced a new, revolutionary brand of athletic sock
into the market. The new innovation is a special sweat-absorbing “cotton-esque” material
that supposedly prevents foot odor. On their fourth day of sales, the snappy slogan, “If
you smell feet, they ain’t wrapped in Poteet’s,” was released, and sales immediately in-
creased. Figure 9.3 is a graph of number of units sold during the first six days of sales.
110
Figure 9.3
The rise of a new sweat-
sock empire.
What was the average rate of units sold per day between day one and day six?
Solution: The problem asks us to find an average rate of change, which translates to find-
ing the slope, m, of the secant line connecting the points (1,6.5) and (6,8.5). To do that,
use our tried-and-true method from algebra:
Remember, the slope of a tan-
gent line to a curve tells you
the curve’s rate of change at
that value of x (i.e., the instan-
taneous rate of change, since
you can only tell what’s going on
at that instant). The slope of the
secant line to a curve tells you
the average rate of change over
the specified interval.
Critical Point

Chapter 9: Laying Down the Law for Derivatives
That means Poteet’s socks sold at a rate of two fifths of a thousand units per day, or 
1,000 = 400 units/day on average. So even through the moderate decreases they 
experienced, the new slogan probably helped. 
111
Trigonometric Derivatives
Before we leave the land of simple derivatives, we must first discuss trigonometric deriva-
tives. Each trig function has a unique derivative that you should memorize. Whereas some
are easy to build from scratch (as you’ll see in Problem 6), others are quite difficult, so it’s
best to memorize the entire list. Trust me—a little memorization now goes a long way
later. Take a deep breath and gaze upon the following list of important trig derivatives:
Problem 5: Given the function g(x) = 3x2 – 5x + 6, find the following values:
(a) the instantaneous rate of change of g(x) when x = 4
(b) the average rate of change on the x interval [–1,3]
You’ve Got Problems

Part 3: The Derivative
It’s not as bad as you think—half of the inverse trig
derivatives are different from the other half by only a
negative sign.
You’ll notice that I have included the inverse trig func-
tions in this list, but you may not recognize them.
Instead of using the notation y = sin–1x to indicate the
inverse sine, I use the notation y = arcsin x. I am a huge
fan of the latter notation, since sin–1x looks a lot like 
(sin x)–1, which is equal to csc x. 
You’ll have to be able to use these formulas with the Product, Quotient, and Chain Rules, so
here are a couple of examples to get you used to them. Remember, if a trig function contains
anything except a single variable (like x), you have to use the Chain Rule to find the derivative.
Example 7: If f(x) = cos x sin 2x, find f ′(x) and evaluate 
.
Solution: Because this function is the product of two variable expressions, you’ll have to
use the Product Rule. In addition, you’ll have to use the Chain Rule to differentiate 
sin 2x, since it contains more than just x inside the sine function. According to the Chain
Rule,

slope of its secant line gives average rate of change.

Even though the derivative is just the slope of a tangent line, its uses are innu-
merable. We’ve already seen that it describes the instantaneous rate of change
of a nonlinear function. However, that hardly explains why it’s one of the most
revolutionary mathematical concepts in history. Soon we’ll be exploring more
(and substantially more exciting) uses for the derivative.
In the meantime, there’s a little bit more grunt work to be done. (That makes
you happy to read, doesn’t it?) This chapter will help you perform specific tasks
and find derivatives for very particular situations. Think of learning derivatives
like trying to get your body in shape. Last chapter, you learned the basics, the
equivalent of a good cardiovascular workout, working all of your muscles in

individual topic here, but exercising all of these abilities at the appropriate time (and know-
ing when that time arrives) is essential to getting yourself in shape mathematically.
Finding Equations of Tangent Lines
Writing tangent line equations is one of the most basic and foundational skills in calculus.
You already know how to create the equation of a line using point-slope form (Chapter 2).
Since it’s the equation of a tangent line you’re after, the slope is the derivative of the func-
tion! All that’s left to do is figure out the appropriate point, and if that were any easier,
it’d be illegal.
Example 1: Write the equation of the tangent line to the curve f(x) = 3x2 – 4x + 1 
when x = 2.
Solution: Take a look at the graph of f(x) in Figure 10.1 to get a sense of our task.
You want to find the equation of the tangent line to the graph at the indicated point
(when x = 2). This is the point of tangency, where the tangent line will strike the graph.
Therefore, this point is both on the curve and on the tangent line. Since point-slope form
requires you to know a point on the line in order to create the equation of that line, you’ll
need to know the coordinates of this point. Since you already know the x-value, plug it
into f(x) to get the corresponding y-value:
114
Figure 10.1
The graph of 
f(x) = 3x2 – 4x + 1 
and a future point 
of tangency. 

Chapter 10: Common Differentiation Tasks
So the point (2,5) is on the tangent line. Now all you need is the slope of the tangent line,
f'(2):
Now that you know a point on the tangent line and the correct slope, slap those values
into point-slope form and out pops the correct tangent line equation:
Occasionally you’ll be asked to find the equation of the normal line to a curve. Because the
normal line is perpendicular to the tangent line at the point of tangency, you use the same
point to create the normal line, but the slope of the normal line is the negative reciprocal
of the slope of the tangent line. Back to
Example 1 for a second. If we want to find the
equation of the normal line to f(x) = 3x2 – 4x +
1 when x = 2, we’d still use the point (2,5), but the
slope would be 
instead of 8. Once again, 
plugging these values into point slope form would
complete the problem.
Implicit Differentiation
I’ve mentioned the phrase “with respect to x” a few times, but now I need to describe to you
exactly what that means. In 95 percent of your problems in calculus, the variables in your
expression will match the variable you are “respecting” in that problem. For example, the
derivative of 5x3 + sin x, with respect to x, is 15x2 + cos x. The fact that I said you were find-
ing the derivative with respect to x didn’t make the problem any harder or any different. In
fact, I didn’t have to tell you which variable you were “respecting,” so to speak, because x
was the only variable in the problem.
In this section, we’ll take the derivative of equations containing x and y, and I will always ask
you to find the derivative with respect to x. What is the derivative of y with respect to x, 
you ask? The answer is this notation: 
. It is literally read,“the derivative of y with respect
to x.” The numerator tells you what you’re deriving, and the denominator tells you what
you’re respecting. 
115
Problem 1: Find the equation of the tangent line to g(x) = 3x3 – x2 + 4x – 2 when x = –1.
You’ve Got Problems
A normal line is perpendicular to
a function’s tangent line at the
point of tangency.

Part 3: The Derivative
Let’s try a slightly more complex derivative. What is the derivative of 3y2, with respect 
to x? The first thing to notice is that the variable in the expression does not match the
variable you’re respecting, so you treat the y as a completely separate function and apply
the Chain Rule. I know you’re not used to using the Chain Rule when there’s only a 
single variable inside the function, but if that variable is not the variable you’re respecting,
you have to give it a hard time and “rough it up” a little. So to differentiate 3y2, start by
deriving the outer function and leaving y (the inner function) alone to get 6y. Now multi-
ply this by the derivative of y with respect to x, and you get:
You will encounter odd derivatives like this whenever you cannot solve an equation for y
or for f(x). You may not have noticed, but every single derivative question until now has
been worded “Find the derivative of y =  …” or “Find the derivative of f(x) ….” When a 
problem asks you to find 
in an equation that cannot be solved for y, you have to 
resort to the process of implicit differentiation, which involves deriving variables with respect
to other variables. Whereas in past problems the derivative would be indicated by y' or
f'(x), the derivative in implicit differentiation is indicated by 
.
116
Example 2: Find the slope of the tangent line to the
graph of x2 + 3xy – 2y2 = –4 at the point (1,–1).
Solution: Yuck! Clearly this is not solved for y, and if
you try to solve for y, you’ll get discouraged quickly—
solving it for y is impossible due to that blasted y2.
Implicit differentiation to the rescue! The first order of
business is finding the derivative of each term of the
equation with respect to x. Since you’re new at this, I’ll
go term by term.
The derivative of x2 with respect to x is 2x. Nothing fancy is needed, since the variable 
in the term is the variable we’re respecting. However, in the next term, 3xy, you have to
use the Product Rule, since there are two variable terms multiplied (3x and y). 
Remember that the derivative of y, with respect to x, is 
, so the correct derivative of 
3xy is 
. Finally, the derivative of –2y2 is 
and the derivative of –4 is 0.
Don’t forget to differentiate on both sides of the equation! Even though I differentiate
implicitly pretty often, I still sometimes forget to differentiate a constant term to get 0. 
I know; I am a lunkhead.
Implicit differentiation allows you
to find the slope of a tangent line
when the equation in question
cannot be solved for y.

Chapter 10: Common Differentiation Tasks
All together now, you get a derivative of: 
Move all of the terms not containing a 
to the right side of the equation. Once you’ve
done that, factor the common 
out of the terms on the left side of the equation:
117
To finally get the derivative 
by itself, divide both sides of the equation by 3x – 4y:
That’s the derivative. The problem asks you to evaluate it at (1,–1), so plug those values in
for x and y to get your final answer:
Differentiating an Inverse Function
Let’s say you’re given the function f(x) = 7x – 5 and are asked to evaluate 
, the
derivative of the inverse of f(x) when x = 1. To find the answer, you would first find the
inverse function (using the process we reviewed in Chapter 3) and then find the derivative.
However, did you know that you can evaluate the derivative of an inverse function even if
you can’t find the inverse function itself? (Insert dramatic soap opera music here.) You’ll learn
how to do it in just a second, but we have to review one skill first.

Part 3: The Derivative
It’s important that you’re able to find values for an inverse function given only the origi-
nal function before we try anything more difficult. The procedure we’ll use is based on
one of the most important properties of inverse functions: if the point (a,b) is on the
graph of f(x), then the point (b,a) is on the graph of f–1(x). In other words, if f(a) = b, then
f–1(b) = a.
Example 3: If g(x) = x3 + 2, evaluate g–1(1).
Solution: Method 1: The easiest way to do this is to figure out exactly what g–1(x) is and
then plug in 1. According to our procedure from Chapter 3, here’s how you’d go about
doing that:
Therefore, 
. However, there is another way to do this without
actually finding g–1(x) first.
Method 2: You’re asked to find the output of g–1(x) when its input is 1. Remember, I just
said that f(a) = b implies f –1(b) = a, so therefore the output of g–1 when I input 1 is the
same exact thing as the input of the original function g when I output 1. So set the original
function equal to 1 and solve; the solution will be g–1(1):
Clearly, either method gives us the same answer.

Chapter 10: Common Differentiation Tasks
Now that you possess this skill, we can gradu-
ate to finding values of the derivative of a
function’s inverse (say that 10 times fast, I
dare you). As is the case with just about
everything in calculus, there is a theorem
governing this practice:
So evaluating the derivative is as simple as plugging the value into this slightly more 
complex, fractiony-looking formula. Once you substitute, your first objective will be to 
evaluate f–1(x) in the denominator (a skill which we just finished practicing, by no small
coincidence).
Example 4: If f(x) = x3 + 4x – 1, evaluate 
.
Solution: According to the formula you learned only moments ago:
Start by evaluating f–1(2), which is the equivalent of solving the equation x3 + 4x + 1 = 2.
This is not an easy equation to solve; in fact, you can’t do it by hand. You’ll have to use
some form of technology to solve the equation, whether it be a graphing calculator equa-
tion solver or a mathematical computer program. One way is to set the equation equal to
zero (x3 + 4x – 1 = 0) and calculate the x-intercept on a graphing calculator. Whichever
method you choose, the answer is x = .2462661722, which you can plug into the formula:
119
Here’s a quick summary of this
inverse function trick. If I want
to evaluate f –1(a), set f (x) = a
and solve for x.
Critical Point
This formula is pretty easy to generate. Start with the simple inverse function property
f (f –1(x)) = x and take the derivative with the Chain Rule:

round any of them until the final answer, or it would

Parametric Derivatives
In order to find a parametric derivative, you differentiate both the x and y components
separately and divide the y derivative by the x derivative. In fancy-schmancy mathematical
form, it looks like this:
This formula suggests that you should derive with respect to t, but you should derive with
respect to whatever parameter appears in the problem. In the following example, for
instance, you’ll derive with respect to θ.
Example 5: Find the slope of the tangent line to the parametric curve defined by x = cos θ
and y = 2sin θ when 
(pictured in Figure 10.2).
Solution: Since the parameter in these equations is θ, the derivative of the set of paramet-
ric equations is
The equation in Example 4
may be difficult to solve, but
it is just plain impossible to calcu-
late the inverse function of f (x) =
x3 + 4x + 1 using our techniques.
So the hard equation is the only
way to get an answer at all!

Though astrologers have maintained for decades that an individual’s astrologi-
cal sign provides insight into his or her personality, tendencies, and fate, many
people remain unconvinced, deeming such thoughts absurd or (in extreme
cases) poppycock. (This could be due to the fact that statements such as “The
moon is in the third house of Pluto” sounds like the title of a new-age Disney
movie.) Astrologers don’t realize how close they actually came to the truth. It
turns out that the signs of the derivatives of a function determine and explain
the function’s behavior.
In fact, the sign of the first derivative of a function explains what direction
that function is heading, and the sign of the second derivative accurately pre-
dicts the concavity of the function. It is the third derivative of a function,
however, that is able to predict when you will find true love, success in busi-
ness, and how many times a week it’s healthy to eat eggs for breakfast. The
easiest way to visualize the signs of a function is via a wiggle graph, which
sounds racy but is really quite ordinary when all is said and done.

Part 3: The Derivative
Relative Extrema
One common human tendency is to compare oneself with his or her peers on a regular
basis. You probably catch yourself doing this all the time, thinking things like, “Of all my
friends, I am definitely the funniest.” Perhaps you compare more mundane things, like
being the best at badminton or having the loudest corduroy pants. However, when you go
outside your social sphere, you often find someone who is significantly funnier than you
or who possesses supersonically loud pants. This illustrates the difference between a rela-
tive extreme point and an absolute extreme point. You can be the smartest of a group of
people without being the smartest person in the world.
For example, look at the graph in Figure 11.1, with points of interest A, B, C, D, and E noted.
124
Figure 11.1
This graph has only one
absolute maximum and
one absolute minimum,
but several relative
extrema.
The absolute maximum on the graph occurs at D, and the absolute minimum on the
graph occurs at E. However, the graph has a relative maximum at B, and a relative mini-
mum at C. These may not be the highest or lowest points of the entire graph, but (as little
hills and valleys) are the highest and lowest points in their immediate vicinity.
Finding Critical Numbers
A critical number is an x-value that causes a function either to equal zero or become unde-
fined. They’re extremely useful for finding extrema points because a function, f(x), can
only change direction at a critical number of its derivative, f ′(x). Why? When f ′(x) is 0,
then f(x) is neither increasing ( f ′(x) ≥0) nor decreasing ( f ′(x) ≤0); meaning f(x) is most
likely about to do something drastic.

Chapter 11: Using Derivatives to Graph
125
Example 1: Given f(x) = x3 – x2 – x + 2, find
f ′(x) and its critical numbers.
Solution: Begin by finding the derivative of f(x),
then set it equal to 0 and solve:
Since there are no places where f ′(x) does not exist, 
and x = 1 are the only two
critical numbers.
If you take a look at the graph of f(x), you’ll notice that the graph does, indeed, change
direction at those x-values (see Figure 11.2).
However, you don’t need to use the graph of a function to determine (1) if the graph
changes direction, or (2) if it does, whether it causes a relative maximum or minimum.
Classifying Extrema
As I alluded to earlier, the sign of f ′(x) tells you whether f (x) is increasing or decreasing.
This is true because an increasing graph will have a tangent line with a positive slope and
a decreasing graph will possess a negatively sloped tangent line. Therefore, you can tell
what’s happening between the critical numbers of f ′(x) (i.e., if f (x) is increasing or
decreasing) by picking some points on the graph between the critical numbers and deter-
mining whether the derivatives there are positive or negative.
A relative extrema point (whether a maximum or a minimum) occurs when that point is
higher or lower than all of the points around it. Visually, a relative maximum is the peak
of a hill in the graph, and a relative minimum is the lowest point of a dip in the graph.
Absolute extrema points are the highest or lowest of all the relative extrema on a graph.
Remember that the term extrema is just plural for “extremely high or low point.”
A critical number is an x-value
that either makes a function zero
or undefined. 

Part 3: The Derivative
Example 2: If f(x) = x3 – x2 – x + 2 and the critical numbers of its derivative, f ′(x), are 
and x = 1, describe the direction of f(x) between those critical numbers using the 
sign of f ′(x).
Solution: Choose three x-values, one less than the first critical number, one between the
critical numbers, and one greater than the second. I will choose simple values to make my
life easier: x = –1, 0, and 2. Plug each of these x’s into f ′(x), and the sign of the result will
tell you if the function f(x) is increasing or decreasing there:
Because f ′(x) is positive when x = –1 and x = –1 comes before the first critical point, the
function will be increasing until 
, the first critical number. However, the derivative
turns negative between the critical numbers, so f is decreasing between 
and 1. 
After x = 1, the derivative turns positive again, so f(x) will increase beyond that point. This
is no giant surprise, since you already saw the graph of f (x) in Figure 11.2, but notice how
the critical numbers create regions where the graph is going different directions (up and
down) as you travel along the graph from left to right. Figure 11.3 shows the signs of f ′(x)
and the graph of f (x) at the same time to help you visualize what's going on.

increasing to decreasing at

Chapter 11: Using Derivatives to Graph
The Wiggle Graph
A wiggle graph is a nice, compact way to visualize the signs of a function’s derivative all at
once. To create a wiggle graph, we’ll use the procedure from Example 2. In other words,
we’ll find the critical numbers, pick “test val-
ues” between those critical numbers, and plug
those into the derivative to determine the
direction of the function. The result will be a
number line, segmented by critical numbers, and
labeled with the signs of the derivative in each of
its intervals. This will help us to quickly find all
relative extreme points on the graph.
Example 3: Create a wiggle graph for the func-
tion 
and use it to determine
which critical numbers are relative extrema.
Solution: First you must find the critical numbers,
where f ′(x) is either equal to 0 or is undefined.
You use the Quotient Rule to find f ′(x):
127
Figure 11.3
Notice how the sign of the
derivative correlates with
the direction of the origi-
nal function. The number
line is actually a wiggle
graph, as you’ll learn in
the next section.
A wiggle graph (or sign graph)
is a segmented number line that
describes the direction of a func-
tion. It is created by finding criti-
cal numbers to determine interval
boundaries, picking sample val-
ues from those intervals, and
plugging the values into the
derivative to obtain the proper
sign. It’s called a wiggle graph
because it tells you which way
the graph is wiggling (i.e., if it is
increasing or decreasing).

Part 3: The Derivative
Since this is a fraction, it is equal to 0 when the numerator equals 0 and undefined when the
denominator is equal to 0. Both of these events interest us for the purpose of finding critical
numbers, so factor the numerator and set both it and the denominator equal to 0 and solve:
The derivative equals 0 when x = 11 or –1 and is undefined when x = 5, so these are the
critical numbers. Draw a number line and mark the numbers on it like Figure 11.4.
128
Figure 11.4
The beginnings of a wiggle
graph. Note that you don’t
need to label any numbers on
it except the critical numbers;
you don’t even have to worry
about drawing it to scale. It’s
just a tool for visualization,
not a scientific graph.

These three critical numbers split the number line into four intervals. Remember that the
function will always go in the same direction during each interval, since it can only change
direction at a critical number. Therefore, you can choose any number in each interval as a
“test value.” I’ll choose the numbers x = –2, 0, 6, and 12. Now, plug these three numbers
into the derivative:

Chapter 11: Using Derivatives to Graph
Because f ′(–2) is positive, f ′(x) is actually positive for the entire interval (–∞,–1), so indi-
cate that with a “+” above the interval in the wiggle graph. Do the same for the other
intervals and you’ll get Figure 11.5.
Now you can tell that the function changes
direction from increasing to decreasing at 
x = –1. If you plug that critical number into
f(x), you get the critical and relative maxi-
mum point (–1,0). Similarly, a sign change at 
x = 11 indicates a relative minimum at the critical
point (11,24).

The Extreme Value Theorem
Your first experience with existence theo-
rems was the Intermediate Value Theorem.
Do you remember it fondly? I guess that’s a
rhetorical question, because whether you liked it
or not, here comes your second existence theorem.
The Extreme Value Theorem, like its predecessor,
really doesn’t say anything earth-shattering, but it
should make a lot of sense, so that’s a plus.
The Extreme Value Theorem: If a function f(x) is
continuous on the closed interval [a,b], then f(x)
has an absolute maximum and an absolute mini-
mum on [a,b].
Figure 11.5
The signs of f′(x) correspond
to the direction of f(x).
Positive means increasing,
negative means decreasing.
Note that the wiggle graph is
clearly labeled “f′(x).” Always
label your wiggles to avoid
confusion.
If a function changes from
increasing to decreasing at a
critical point, that point is a rel-
ative maximum. Similarly, a
change from decreasing to
increasing indicates a relative
minimum.
Critical Point
Before you conclude that a
sign change in a wiggle
graph indicates a relative
extrema point, make sure that the
original function is defined there! 
For example, in 
, the 
function changes from increasing
to decreasing at x = 0 (verify with
a wiggle graph of f ′(x)). However,
x = 0 is not in the domain of
f (x), so it cannot be a relative
maximum.

Part 3: The Derivative
This theorem simply says that a piece of continuous function will always have a highest
point and a lowest point. That’s all. Here’s a little tip: a function’s absolute extrema can
only occur at one of two places—either at a relative extrema point or at an endpoint. This
little trick makes finding the absolute extrema points very easy.
Example 4: Find the absolute maximum and absolute minimum of the function
on the interval [–2,1].
Solution: The absolute extrema you are looking for are guaranteed to exist according to
the Extreme Value Theorem, since f(x) is continuous on the closed interval. In fact, f(x) 
is continuous everywhere! Start by drawing a wiggle graph. Same process as always: 
set f ’(x) = 0 and plug test values into the derivative:
Check out the wiggle graph in Figure 11.6. Because the sign of its derivative changes at
both critical numbers (and they are both in the domain of f(x)), you know that x = –1 and
1 mark relative extrema and therefore possibly absolute extrema as well.
x = –1, 1

Since an extreme value (an absolute maximum or mini-
mum) can only occur at a critical number (x = –1 or 1) or
an endpoint (x = –2 or 1), plug each of those x-values into
f(x) to see which yields the highest and lowest values:
Therefore, the absolute maximum of f(x) on the closed interval [–2, 1] will be 
and the 
absolute minimum is 
. I know that those fractions were ugly, but whatever doesn’t 
kill you makes you stronger, right? You’re not buying that, are you?

Determining Concavity
Just as the first derivative f ′(x) describes the direction of the function f(x), the sign of the
second derivative describes f ″(x), the concavity of f (x). In other words, if f ″(x) is positive
for some x-value, then f(x) is concave up at that point. If, however, f ″(x) is negative, then
f(x) is concave down there. What is concavity, though? Does it have anything to do with
proper dental hygiene?
Concavity describes how a curve bends. A curve
that can hold water poured into it from the top
of the graph is said to be concave up, whereas
one that cannot hold water is said to be concave
down. The sign of the second derivative reveals a
function’s concavity; if f ″(x) is positive, then f (x) is
concave up. If, however, f ″(x) is negative, then
f (x) is concave down. You can remember this rela-
tionship between the second derivative’s sign and
the concavity using Figure 11.8.
Reporting an absolute maximum of –1 and an absolute minimum of –2 for Example
#4 is a common error. Although these are the x-values where the extrema occur,
they are not the extreme values themselves. Absolute maxima and minima are heights—
function values, not x-values.
Kelley’s Cautions
Problem 3: Find the absolute maximum and minimum of g(x) = x3 + 4x2 + 5x – 2 on
the closed interval [–5,2].
You’ve Got Problems
Not only does the sign of f ″(x) describe the concavity of f(x), it also describes the direc-
tion of f ′(x). This is because f ″(x) is also the first derivative of f ′(x), and remember that
first derivatives describe the direction of their predecessors. For example, if g″(2) = –7
for some function g(x), then we know that g(x) is concave down when x = 2 (since
the second derivative is negative) and we know that g′(x) is decreasing at x = 2.
Critical Point
The concavity of a curve
describes the way the curve
bends. Notice that the concave
up curve in Figure 11.7 would
catch water poured into it from
above, whereas the concave
down curve would dump the
water onto the floor, causing your
mother to get angry.

A tale of two curves whose
second derivatives differ
(you’ll see what I mean
soon).
Just like direction, however, the concavity of a curve
can change throughout the function’s domain (the
points of change are called inflection points). You’ll use a
process that mirrors the first derivative wiggle graph to
determine a function’s concavity.
Another Wiggle Graph
Hopefully you’ve seen how useful a wiggle graph can be to visualize a function’s direction.
It is just as useful when visualizing concavity, and is just as easy. This time, you’ll use the
second derivative to create the wiggly number line, and you’ll plug test values into the sec-
ond derivative rather than the first derivative to come up with the appropriate signs. Let’s
revisit an old friend, f(x) from Example 4.
Example 5: On what intervals is the function 
concave up?
Solution: Find the second derivative, f ″(x), and use it to create a wiggle graph, as you did
earlier in the chapter. The only difference is that you’ll use f ″(x) for everything instead of
f ′(x):
Set f ″(x) = 0 and solve for x to get your critical numbers:

Don’t forget the ± sign, because you are square-rooting both sides of an equation. It’s time
to draw the wiggle graph and choose test points just like before. Because you already
know how to do this, let’s jump straight to the correct graph in Figure 11.9.

The Second Derivative Test
Even though it is called the Second Derivative Test, this little math trick tells you whether
or not an extrema point is a relative maximum or minimum (which you did using the signs
of the first derivative and a wiggle graph earlier). The Second Derivative Test uses the sign
of the second derivative (and therefore the concavity of the graph at that point) to do all
the work.
The Second Derivative Test: Plug the critical numbers that occur when f ′(x) = 0 or f ′(x) is
undefined into f ″(x). If the result is positive, that critical number is a relative minimum on
f(x). If the result is negative, that critical number marks a relative maximum on f(x). If the
result is 0, you cannot draw any conclusion from the Second Derivative Test and must
resort to the first derivative wiggle graph.
Example 6: Classify all the relative extrema of the function g(x) = 3x3 – 18x + 1 using the
Second Derivative Test.

Mathematics can actually be applied in the real world. This may shock and

Part 3: The Derivative
Position equations are a nice transition into calculus word problems. Even though they
are slightly bizarre, they follow clear patterns. Furthermore, they give you the chance to
show off your new derivative skills.
The Position Equation
A position equation is an equation that mathematically models something in real life.
Specifically, it gives the position of an object at a specified time. Different books and
teachers use different notation, but I will always indicate a position equation with the
notation s(t), to stay consistent. By plugging values of t
into the equation, you can determine where the object
in question was at that moment in time. Just in case
you’re starting to get stressed out, I’ll insert something
cute and cuddly into the mix—my cat, Peanut.
Peanut pretty much has the run of my basement, and
her favorite pastime (apart from her strange habit of
chewing on my eyeglasses) is batting a ball back and
forth along one of the basement walls. For the sake of
ease, let’s say the wall in question is 20 feet long; we’ll
call the exact middle of the wall position 0, the left edge
of the wall (our left, not her left) position –10, and the
right edge of the wall position 10, as in Figure 12.1.

Let’s examine the kitty’s position versus time in a simple example. We’ll keep returning to
this example throughout the chapter as we compound our knowledge of derivatives and
motion (and cat recreation).
A position equation is a mathe-
matical model that outputs an
object’s position at a given time
t. Position is usually given with
relation to some fixed landmark,
like the ground or the origin, so
that a negative position means
something. For example, s(5) =
–6 may mean that the object in
question is 6 feet below the ori-
gin after 5 seconds have passed.

of a particularly frisky playtime, Peanut’s
position (in feet at time = t seconds) along
the wall is given by the equation 
s(t) = t3 – 3t2 – 2t + 1. Evaluate and explain
what is meant by s(0), s(2), and s(4).
Solution: Plug each number into s(t). A positive
answer means she is toward the right of the room,
whereas a negative answer means she is to the left
of center. The larger the number, the farther she
is to the right or left:
s(0) = 03 – 3⋅02 – 2⋅0 + 1 = 1
s(2) = 23 – 3⋅22 – 2⋅2 + 1 = 8 – 12 – 4 + 1 = –7
s(4) = 43 – 3⋅42 – 2⋅4 + 1 = 64 – 48 – 8 + 1 = 9
Therefore, when t = 0 (i.e., before you start measuring elapsed time), s(0) = 1 tells you the
cat began 1 foot to the right of the center. Two seconds later (t = 2), she had used her
lightning-fast kitty movements to travel 8 feet left, meaning she was then only 3 feet from
the left wall, and 7 feet left of center. Two seconds after that (t = 4), she had moved 16 feet
right, now only 1 foot away from the right-hand wall. That is one fast-moving cat.
There’s nothing really fancy about the posi-
tion equation; given a time input, it tells you
where the object was at that moment. Notice
that the position equation in Example 1 is a
nice, continuous, and differentiable poly-
nomial. You can find the derivative awfully
easily, but what does the derivative of the 
position equation represent?
137
The position given by s(t) in
Example 1 is the horizontal
position of the cat—had it meant
vertical position, that negative
answer would have been disturb-
ing. Every position problem should
infer what is meant by its output
and will usually include units (such
as feet and seconds) as well.
Kelley’s Cautions
The value s(0) is often called
initial position, since it gives
the position of the object
before you start measuring
time. Similarly, v(0) and a(0) are
the initial velocity and initial
acceleration.

Problem 1: A particle moves vertically (in inches) along the y-axis according to the 
position equation 
, where t represents seconds. At what time(s) 
is the particle 30 inches below the origin?

Part 3: The Derivative
Velocity
Remember that the derivative describes the rate of change of a function. Therefore, s’(t)
describes the velocity of the object in question at any given instant. It makes sense that
velocity is equivalent to the rate of change of position, since velocity measures how quickly
you move from one position to another. Speed also measures how quickly something
moves, but speed and velocity are not the same thing. 
Velocity combines an object’s speed with its direction, whereas speed just gives you the
rate at which the object is traveling. Practically speaking, this means that velocity can be
negative, but speed cannot. What does a negative velocity mean? It depends on the prob-
lem. In a horizontal motion problem (like the Peanut the cat problem), it means velocity
towards the left (since the left was defined as the negative direction). In a vertical motion
problem, a negative velocity typically means that the
object is dropping.
To find the velocity of an object at any instant, calcu-
late the derivative and plug in the desired time for t. If,
however, you want an object’s average velocity (i.e.,
average rate of change), remember that this value
comes from the slope of the secant line. Remember
how quickly Peanut was darting around in Example 1?
Let’s get those exact speeds using the derivative.
Example 2: Peanut the cat’s position, in feet, for 0 ≤t ≤4 seconds is given by s(t) = t3 – 
3t2 – 2t + 1. Find her velocity and speed at times t = 1 and t = 3.5 seconds, and give her
average velocity over the t interval [1,3.5]. 
Solution: There are lots of parts to this problem, but none are hard. Start by calculating
her velocity at the given times. Remember that the velocity is the first derivative of the
position equation, so s’(t) = v(t) = 3t2 – 6t – 2:
v(1) = 3 – 6 – 2 = –5 ft/sec
v(3.5) = 36.75 – 21 – 2 = 13.75 ft/sec
Peanut is moving at a speed of 5 ft/sec to the left (since the velocity is negative) at t = 1
second, and she is moving much faster, at a speed of 13.75 ft/sec to the right, when 
t = 3.5 seconds. Now to find the average velocity on [1,3.5]—it’s equal to the slope of the
line segment connecting the points on the position graph where t = 1 and t = 3.5. To find
these points, plug those values into s(t):
138
If an object is moving downward
at a rate of 15 feet per second,
you could say that its velocity is
–15 ft/sec, whereas its speed
is 15 ft/sec. Speed is always the
absolute value of velocity.
Critical Point

Chapter 12: Derivatives and Motion
s(1) = 1 – 3 – 2 + 1 = –3
s(3.5) = 42.875 – 36.75 – 7 + 1 = 0.125
Calculate the secant slope using the points
(1,–3) and (3.5, 0.125):
Therefore, even though she runs left and right at
varying speeds over the time interval [1,3.5], she
averages a rightward speed of 1.25 ft/sec.
139
Acceleration
As velocity is to position, so is acceleration to velocity. In other words, acceleration is the
rate of change of velocity. Think about it—if you’re driving in a car that suddenly speeds
up, the sense of being pushed back in your seat is due to the effects of acceleration. It is
not the high rate of speed that makes roller coasters so scary. Aside from their height, it is
the sudden acceleration and deceleration of the rides that causes the passengers to experi-
ence dizzying effects (and occasionally their 
previous meal).
To calculate the acceleration of an object,
evaluate the second derivative of the posi-
tion equation (or the first derivative of
velocity). To calculate average acceleration,
find the slope of the secant line on the velocity
function (for the same reasons that average 
velocity is the secant slope on the position func-
tion). Let’s head back to the cat of mathematical
mysteries one last time.
The slope of a position
equation’s tangent line
equals the instantaneous velocity
at the point of tangency. The slope
of a position equation’s secant
line gives the average velocity
over that interval. Notice that
instantaneous and average rates
of change are both based on lin-
ear slopes drawn on the position
equation, not its derivative.
Kelley’s Cautions
Problem 2: A particle moves vertically (in inches) along the y-axis according to the 
position equation 
, where t represents seconds. Rank the following
from least to greatest: the speed when t = 3, the velocity when t = 7, and the average
velocity on the interval [2,6].
You’ve Got Problems
The units for acceleration will
be the same as the units for
velocity, except the denomina-
tor will be squared. For exam-
ple, if velocity is measured in feet
per second (ft/sec), then acceler-
ation is measured in feet per sec-
ond per second, or ft/sec2.
Critical Point

Part 3: The Derivative
Example 3: Peanut the cat’s position, in feet, at any
time 0 ≤t ≤4 seconds is given by s(t) = t3 – 3t2 – 2t + 1.
When, on the interval [0,10], is she decelerating?
Solution: Since the sign of the second derivative deter-
mines acceleration, you want to know when s″(x) is
negative. So, make an s″(x) wiggle graph by setting it
equal to 0, finding critical numbers, and picking test
points (as you did in Chapter 11). The wiggle graph
for the second derivative is given in Figure 12.2.
s’(t) = v(t) = 3t2 – 6t – 2
s’’(t) = v’(t) = a(t) = 6t – 6
6t – 6 = 0
t = 1
The acceleration equation s’’(t) is negative on the interval (0,1), so the cat decelerates only
between t = 0 and t = 1.
140
Figure 12.2
Since s″(x) is negative on
(0,1), she is decelerating
on that interval.
Projectile Motion
One of the easiest types of motion to model in elementary calculus is projectile motion,
the motion of an object acted upon solely by gravity. Have you ever noticed that any
thrown object follows a parabolic path to the ground?
It is very easy to write the position equation describing
that path with only a tiny bit of information. Mind you,
these equations can’t give you the exact position, since
ignoring wind resistance and drag makes the problem
much easier.
Scientists often pooh-pooh these little pseudoscientific
math applications, saying that ignoring such factors as
If the first derivative of position
represents velocity and the sec-
ond derivative represents accel-
eration, the third derivative
represents “jerk,” the rate of
change of acceleration. Think of
jerk as that feeling you get as you
switch gears in your car and the
acceleration changes. I’ve never
seen a problem concerning jerk,
but I have known a few mathe-
maticians who were pretty jerky.

grossest examples of projectile
motion is in the movie The

wind resistance and drag renders these examples worthless. Math people usually contend
that, although not perfect, these examples show how useful even a simple mathematical
concept can be.
The position equation of a projectile looks like this:
You plug the object’s initial velocity into v0, the initial height into h0, and the appropriate
gravitational constant into g (which stands for acceleration due to gravity)—if you are
working in feet, use g = 32, whereas g = 9.8 if the problem contains meters. Once you cre-
ate your position equation by plugging into the formula, it will work just like the other
position equations from this chapter, outputting the vertical height of the object in rela-
tion to the ground at any time t (for example, a position of 12 translates to a position of 12
feet above ground).
Example 4: Here’s a throwback to 1970s television for you. A radio station called WKRP
in Cincinnati is running a radio promotion. For Thanksgiving, they are dropping live
turkeys from the station’s traffic helicopter
into the city below, but little do they know
that turkeys are not so good at the whole
flying thing. Assuming that the turkeys
were tossed with a miniscule initial velocity
of 2 ft/sec from a safe hovering height of
1,000 feet above ground, how long does it
take a turkey to hit the road below, and at what
speed will the turkey be traveling at that time?
Solution: The problem contains feet, so use g = 32 ft/sec2; you’re given v0 = 2 and h0 = 1,000,
so plug these into the formula to get the position equation of s(t) = –16t2 + 2t + 1,000. You
want to know when they hit the ground, which means they have a position of 0, so solve
the equation –16t2 + 2t + 1,000 = 0. You can use a calculator or the quadratic formula to
come up with the answer of t = 7.9684412 seconds (the other answer of –7.84 doesn’t
make sense—a negative answer suggests going back in time, and that’s never a good idea,
especially with poultry). If you plug that value into s′(x), you’ll find that the turkeys were
falling at a velocity of –252.990 ft/sec. Oh, the humanity.
141
Notice that g always equals
either –32 or –9.8, depending
on the units of the problem. This
is because the pull of gravity
never changes.

Evaluating Limits: L’Hôpital’s Rule
Way, way back, many chapters ago, in a galaxy far, far away, you were stressed about 
limits. Since then, you’ve had a whole lot more to stress about, so it’s high time we 
destressed you a bit. Little did you know that as you were plugging away, learning 
derivatives, you also learned a terrific shortcut for finding limits. This shortcut (called
L’Hôpital’s Rule) can be used to find limits that, after substitution, are in indeterminate
form.
To show just how useful L’Hôpital’s Rule is, we’ll return
briefly to Chapter 6 and fish out two limits we couldn’t
previously calculate by hand. These two limits will com-
prise the next example. The first limit we could only
memorize (but couldn’t justify via any of our methods
at the time). We calculated the second limit using a lit-
tle trick (comparing degrees for limits at infinity), but
that method was a trick only. We had no proof or justi-
fication for it at all. Finally, a little pay dirt for the curi-
ous at heart.
Part 3: The Derivative

L’Hôpital’s Rule: If 
and 
is in indeterminate form (e.g., 
or 
),
then 
. In other words, take the derivatives of the numerator and
denominator separately (not via the Quotient Rule) and substitute in c again to find the
limit.
Example 1: Calculate both of the following limits
using L’Hôpital’s Rule:
a)
Solution: If you substitute in x = 0, you get 
,
and 
is in indeterminate form. So apply L’Hôpital’s
Rule by taking the derivative of sin x (which is cos x)
and the derivative of x (which is 1) and replacing those
pieces with their derivatives:
 
L’Hôpital’s Rule can only be
used to calculate limits that are
indeterminate (i.e., the value
cannot immediately be found).
The most common indeterminate 
forms are 
and 0 . ∞.
Critical Point
You can only use L’Hôpital’s
Rule (pronounced low-pee-
TOWELS) if you have indetermi-
nate form after substituting—it will
not work for other, more common,
limits.

Now substituting won’t give you 
. In fact, substituting gives you cos 0, which equals 1.
You learned that 1 was the answer in Chapter 6, but now you know why.
b) 
Solution: If you plug in x = ∞for all the x’s you get a huge number on top divided by a
huge number on the bottom 
, which is in indeterminate form so apply L’Hôpital’s 
Rule:
Uh oh. Substitution still gives you 
. Never fear—keep applying L’Hôpital’s Rule until 
substituting gives you a legitimate answer:
Once there are no more x’s in the problem 
, no substitution is necessary, and the
answer falls out like a ripe fruit.

More Existence Theorems
Man has struggled for centuries to define life and to determine what, exactly, defines exis-
tence. Descartes once mused, “I think, therefore I am,” suggesting that thought defined
existence. Most calculus students go one step further, lamenting, “I am in mental anguish,
therefore I am in calculus.” Philosophy aside, the next two theorems don’t try to answer
such deep questions; they simply state that something exists, and that’s good enough for
them.

The Mean Value Theorem
This neat little theorem gives an explicit relationship
between the average rate of change of a function (i.e.,
the slope of a secant line) and the instantaneous rate of
change of a function (i.e., the slope of a tangent line).
Specifically, it guarantees that at some point on a closed
interval, the tangent line will be parallel to the secant
line for that interval (see Figure 13.1). 
146
Figure 13.1
Here, the secant line is
drawn connecting the
endpoints of the closed
interval [a,b]. At x = c,
which is on that interval,
the tangent line is parallel
to the secant line.
Mathematically, parallel lines have equal slopes. There-
fore, there is always some place on an interval where a
continuous function is changing at exactly the same rate
it’s changing on average for the entire interval. Here’s
the theorem in math jibber jabber:
The Mean Value Theorem: If a function f(x) is contin-
uous and differentiable on the closed interval [a,b], 
then there exists a point c between a and b such that
. In other words, a point c is guaranteed 
to exist such that the derivative there (f′(c)) is equal to the 
slope of the secant line for the interval [a,b] 
.
Example 2: At what x-value(s) on the interval [–2,3] does the graph of f(x) = x2 + 2x – 1
satisfy the Mean Value Theorem?
It’s called the Mean Value
Theorem because a major
component of it is the average
(or mean) rate of change for
the function. It has no twin called
the Kind Value Theorem.
Critical Point
The Mean Value Theorem makes
good sense. Think of it like this.
If, on a 2-hour car trip, you
averaged 50 miles per hour,
then (according to the Mean
Value Theorem) at least once dur-
ing the trip, your speedometer
actually read 50 mph.
Critical Point

Chapter 13: Common Derivative Applications
Solution: Somewhere, the derivative must equal the secant slope; so start by finding the
derivative of f(x): 
f ′(x) = 2x + 2
That was easy. Now find the secant slope over the interval [–2,3]. To calculate it, first plug
–2 and 3 into the function to get the secant’s endpoints: (–2,–1) and (3,14):
Therefore, at some point on the interval, the derivative, f′(x) = 2x + 2, and the secant slope
you calculated, 3, must be equal:
Look at the graph of f(x) in Figure 13.2 to verify that the tangent line at 
is parallel
to the secant line connecting (–2,–1) and (3,14).

Rolle’s Theorem
Rolle’s Theorem is a specific case of the Mean Value Theorem. It says that if the slope of
a function’s secant line is 0 (in other words, the secant line is horizontal because the end-
points of the interval are located at the exact same height on the graph) then somewhere
on that interval, the tangent slope will also be 0. Since you already understand the Mean
Value Theorem, this isn’t new information. Our previous theorem guaranteed the lines
would have the same slope no matter what the secant slope was. Here’s how Rolle’s
Theorem is defined mathematically:
Rolle’s Theorem: If a function f(x) is continuous and differentiable on a closed interval [a,b]
and f(a) = f(b), then there exists a c between a and b such that f ′(c) = 0.
Let’s prove this with the Mean Value Theorem—it guarantees that the secant slope will
equal the tangent slope somewhere on [a,b]. The secant slope connecting the points (a,f(a))
and (b,f(b)) is 
, but since the theorem states that f(a) = f(b), this fraction
becomes 
. Therefore, the slope of the secant line is 0. According to the Mean
Value Theorem, f ’(x) has to equal 0 somewhere inside the interval, at a point Rolle’s
Theorem calls c.
Related Rates
Related rates problems are among the most popular problems (for teachers) and feared
problems (for students) in calculus. You can tell if a given problem is a related rates prob-
lem because it will contain wording like “how quickly is … changing?” Basically you’re
asked to figure out how quickly one variable in a problem is changing if you know how
quickly another variable is changing. No two problems will be alike, but the procedure is
exactly the same for all problems of this type, and they actually get to be sort of fun once
you get used to them.
Let’s walk through a classic related rates problem: a ladder sliding down the side of a
house dilemma. The only step that will differ between this and any other related rates
problem is the very first one: finding an equation that characterizes the situation. Once
you get past that initial step, everything is smooth sailing.
Example 3: Goofus and Gallant (of Highlights magazine fame), are painting my house.
Whereas Gallant properly secured his 13-foot ladder before climbing it, Goofus did not,
and as he climbs his ladder, it slides down the side of the house at a constant rate of 2
feet/second. How quickly is the base of the ladder sliding horizontally away from the
house when the top of the ladder is 5 feet from the ground?
Solution: You can tell this is a related rates problem because it’s asking you to find how
quickly something is changing or moving. I always start these by drawing a picture of the
situation (see Figure 13.3).
148

Chapter 13: Common Derivative Applications
You need to pick an equation that represents the situation. Notice that the ladder, the
house, and the ground make a right triangle; the problem gives you information about the
lengths of the legs of a right triangle. Therefore, you should use the Pythagorean
Theorem as your primary equation, as it relates the lengths of the sides of a right triangle.
To make it easier to visualize, I will strip away all of the extraneous visual information:

with respect to t:

example.

Part 3: The Derivative
You might be wondering, “What does 
mean?” It
represents how quickly a is changing. The problem
tells you that the ladder is falling, so side a is actually
getting smaller at a rate of 2 ft/sec, so write 
. At 
this moment, you have no idea what 
equals, because 
that’s the quantity you’re looking for. However, you do
know that 
, because c (the length of the ladder) 
will not change as it slides down the house. Now you
know most of the variables in the equation. In fact, you can even calculate b = 12 using the
Pythagorean Theorem, knowing that the other sides of the triangle are 5 and 13. So plug
in everything you know:
All you have to do is solve for 
and you’re finished:
Therefore, b is increasing at a rate of 
, and that’s 
how quickly the base of the ladder is sliding away from
the house.
Here are the steps to completing a related rates problem:
1. Construct an equation containing all the necessary
variables.
2. Before substituting any values, differentiate the
entire equation with respect to t.
3. Plug in values for all the variables except the one for which you’re solving.
4. Solve for the unknown variable.

in size, its accompanying
rate must be negative. In Ex-

Optimization
Even though optimization is (arguably) the most feared of all differentiation applications,
I have never understood why. When you’re looking for the biggest or smallest something
can get (i.e., optimizing), all you have to do is create a formula representing that quantity
and then find the relative extrema using wiggle graphs. You’ve been doing these things a
while now, so don’t get freaked out unnecessarily. To explore optimization, we’ll again
examine a classic calculus problem that has haunted students like you for years and years.
Example 4: If you create a box by cutting congruent squares from the corners of a piece
of paper measuring 11 by 14 inches, give the dimensions of the box with the largest possi-
ble volume. (Assume that the box has no lid.)
Solution: Back in Chapter 1, I hinted about how to create a box out of a flat piece of
paper. Try it for yourself. Place a rectangular sheet of paper in front of you and cut con-
gruent squares from the corners. You’ll end up with smaller rectangles along the sides of
your paper. Fold these up, toward you, along the seam created by the inner sides of the
recently removed squares. Can you see how the rectangles left correspond to dimensions
of the box (see Figure 13.5)?
151
Figure 13.5
The height of the box will
be x inches, since the side
length of the cut-out
squares dictates how
deeply to fold the paper.

I have labeled the sides of the corner squares as x in Figure 13.5. Once you cut out those
squares, the length of the top and bottom is 11 – 2x, since it was 11 inches and you removed
two lengths, each measuring x inches. Similarly, the sides of the box will measure 14 – 2x
inches. 
Now that you have a good idea what is happening visually, lets get hip-deep in the math.
You are trying to make the largest possible volume, so your primary equation should be
for volume for this box. The volume for any box like this is V = l ⋅ w ⋅ h, where l = length,
w = width, and h = height. Plug in the correct values for l, w, and h:

Part 3: The Derivative
V = (14 – 2x)(11 – 2x)x
V = 4x3 – 50x2 + 154x
If you plug in any x, this function gives you the volume
of the box generated when squares of side x are cut out.
Cool, eh? You want to find the value of x that makes V
the largest, so find the value guaranteed by the
Extreme Value Theorem. Take the derivative with
respect to x and do a wiggle graph (see Figure 13.6),
just like you did in Chapter 11.
V’ = 12x2 – 100x + 154 = 0
6x2 – 50x + 77 = 0
152
Figure 13.6
The wiggle graph for V’.
A relative maximum
occurs at x ≈ 2.039.
Even though x = 6.295 appears to be a minimum, the answer doesn’t make sense (see the
“Kelley’s Cautions” sidebar). The maximum volume is reached when x = 2.039 (because
V’ changes from positive to negative there, meaning that V goes from increasing to
decreasing), so the optimal dimensions are 2.039 inches
by 6.922 inches by 9.922 inches (x, 11 – 2x, and 
14 – 2x, respectively).
Here are the steps for optimizing functions:
1. Construct an equation in one variable that repre-
sents what you are trying to maximize.
2. Find the derivative with respect to the variable in 
the problem and draw a wiggle graph.
3. Verify your solutions as the correct extrema type
(either maximum or minimum) by viewing the
sign changes around it in the wiggle graph.
As you plug the variables
into the primary equation,
your goal should be to have only
one main variable. In Example 4,
you change l, w, and h so they
all contain only one variable (x).
Don’t worry that V is a variable—
you don’t deal with the left side
of the equation at all.
Kelley’s Cautions
In Example 4, consider only
values of x between 0 and
5.5. Why? Well, if x is less than
0, you’re not cutting out any
squares, and if x is greater than
5.5, then the (11 – 2x) width of
your box becomes 0 or smaller,
and that’s just not allowed. A real-
life box must have some width.

For those of you with a good background in superhero (or Seinfeld) lore,
you’ll know what I mean by Bizzarro world. In Bizzarro world, everything is
the opposite of this world; good means bad, up means down, and right means
left. Since Superman is smart in our world, Bizzarro Superman is stupid. Well,
integrals are Bizzarro derivatives. Deriving takes us from a function to an
expression describing its rate of change, but integrating takes us the opposite
direction—from the rate of change back to the original function.
Even though integrating is simply the opposite of deriving, you might think
that its usefulness would be limited. You’d be wrong. There are just about as
many applications for integrals as there were for derivatives, but they are com-
pletely different in nature. Instead of finding rates of change, we’ll calculate
area, volume, and distance traveled. We’ll also explore the Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus, which explains the exact relationship between integrals
and the area beneath a curve. It’s surprising how straightforward that relation-
ship is and how dang useful it can be.

If not, here’s a recap. Everyone’s trapped in this city bus, which will explode if
the speedometer goes below 50 mph. So, you’ve got this killer, runaway bus
that’s flying around the city and can’t stop—the perfect breeding ground for
destruction, disaster, high drama, mayhem, and a budding romance between
the movie’s two stars. (Darn that Keanu … talk about being in the right place
at the right time ….)
By now, you probably feel like you’re on that bus. Calculus is tearing all over
the place, never slowing down, never stopping, and (unfortunately) never
inhabited by such attractive movie stars. The more you learn about deriva-

Just when you understand something, another (seemingly unrelated) topic
pops up to confound your understanding. When will this bus slow down?
Actually, the bus slows down right now.

You may feel a slight lurching in the pit of your stomach as we slow to a complete stop,
and start discussing something completely and utterly different for a while. Until now, we
have spent a ton of time talking about rates of change and tangent slopes. That’s pretty
much over. Instead, we’re going to start talking about finding the area under curves. I
know that’s a big change, but it’ll all come together in the end. For now, take a deep
breath, and enjoy a much slower pace for a few chapters as we talk about something dif-
ferent. And if you see Sandra Bullock, tell her I said hi.
Riemann Sums
Let me begin by saying something deeply philosophical. Curves are really, really curvy. It
is this inherent curviness that makes it hard to find the area beneath them. For example,
take a look at the graph of y = x2 + 1 in Figure 14.1 (only the interval [0,3] is pictured).
158
Figure 14.1
If only the shaded region
between y = x2 + 1 and the
x-axis were a square or a
rectangle—that would
make finding the area so
much easier.

We want to try and figure out exactly how much area is represented by the shaded space.
We don’t have any formulas from geometry to help us find the area of such a curved fig-
ure, so we’re going to need to come up with some new techniques. To start with, we’re
going to approximate that area using figures for which we already have area formulas.
Even though it seems kind of lame, we’re going to approximate the shaded area using rec-
tangles. The process of using rectangles to approximate area is called Riemann sums.

Chapter 14: Approximating Area
Right and Left Sums
I am going to approximate that shaded area
beneath y = x2 + 1 using three rectangles.
Since I am only finding the area on the x-
interval [0,3], that means I will be using
three rectangles, each of width 1. (If I had been
using six rectangles on an interval of length 3,
each rectangle would have width .) How high 
should I make each rectangle? Well, I choose to
use a right sum, which means that the rectangles
will be the height reached by the function at the
right side of each interval, as pictured in Fig-
ure 14.2.
159
Figure 14.2
I am using three rectan-
gles to approximate the
area on [0,3]. The three
rectangles cover the inter-
vals [0,1], [1,2], and [2,3].

A Riemann sum is an approximation of an area calculated using rectangles. We are
using very simple Riemann sums. Some calculus courses will explore very complicated
sums, which involve crazy formulas containing sigma signs (∑). These are a little
beyond us, and they really don’t help you understand the underlying calculus concepts
at all, so I omit them.
When I say we are looking for
the area beneath the curve, I
actually mean the area between
the curve and the x-axis; other-
wise, the area beneath a curve
would almost always be infinite.
You can always assume that you
are finding the area between the
curve and the x-axis unless the
problem states otherwise.
Critical Point

Part 4: The Integral
The rectangle on [0,1] will have the height reached at the far right side of the interval
(i.e., x = 1), which is 2. Similarly, the second rectangle is 5 units tall, since that is the
height of the function at x = 2, the right side of its interval. Therefore, the heights of the
rectangles are 2, 5, and 10, from left to right. The width of each rectangle is 1.
We can approximate the area beneath the curve by adding the areas of the three rectan-
gles together. Since the area of a rectangle is equal to its length times its width, the total
area captured by the rectangles is 1 ⋅2 + 1 ⋅5 + 1 ⋅10 = 17. Therefore, the right Riemann
approximation with n = 3 rectangles is 17.
160
Clearly, the area covered by the rectangles is much
more than is beneath the curve. In fact, it looks like a
lot more. This should tell you that we have got to come
up with better methods later (and indeed we will). For
now, let’s have a go at the same area problem, but this
time use four rectangles and left sums.
Example 1: Approximate the area beneath the curve
f(x) = x2 + 1 on the interval [0,3] using a left Riemann
sum with four rectangles.
Solution: To find how wide each of the four rectangles 
will be, use the formula
:
If each of the four intervals is 
wide, and the rectangles start at 0, then the rectangles
will be defined by the intervals 
. (This is because 
,
, etc.) You will be using the heights reached by the function at the left
boundary of each interval. Therefore, the heights will be 
, as
illustrated in Figure 14.3.
 
 
 
 
It was easy to see that the width of every rectangle in our right sum was 1. If the
width of the rectangles is not so obvious, use the width formula 
to
calculate the width. In this formula, the interval [a,b] is split up into n different rectangles, 
and each will have width Δx. In our right sum example, 
, since we are
splitting up the interval [0,3] into n = 3 rectangles. 
Critical Point
The kind of sum you’re calculat-
ing depends on how high you
make the rectangles. If you use
the height at each rectangle’s left
boundary, you’re finding left
sums. If you use the height at the
right boundary of each rectan-
gle, the result is right sums. Ob-
viously, midpoint sums use the
height reached by the function in
the middle of each interval.

Chapter 14: Approximating Area
The area of each rectangle is its width times its height, so the total area is 
This number underestimates the actual area beneath the curve, since there are large pieces
of that area missed by our rectangles.
Midpoint Sums
Calculating midpoint sums is very similar to right and left sums. The only difference is
(you guessed it) how you define the heights of the rectangles. In our ongoing example of
f(x) = x2 + 1 on the x-interval [0,3], let’s say we wanted to calculate midpoint sums using
(to make it easy) n = 3 rectangles. As before, the intervals defining the rectangles’ bound-
aries will be [0,1], [1,2], and [2,3], and each rectangle will have a width of 1. What about
the heights?
Look at the interval [0,1]. If we were using left sums, the height of the rectangle would be
f(0). Using right sums, it’d be f(1). However, we’re using midpoint sums, so you use the
function value at the midpoint of the interval, which in this case is 
. Therefore, the
161
Figure 14.3
Each of the four rectangles is
wide, and they are as high
as the function f(x) = x2 + 1
at the left edge of each rec-
tangle, hence left sums is the
result.

The Trapezoidal Rule
Unfortunately, unless you use a ton of rectangles, Riemann sums are just not all that accurate.
The Trapezoidal Rule, however, is a much more accurate way to approximate area beneath 
a curve. Instead of constructing rectangles, this method
uses small trapezoids. In effect, these trapezoids look 
the same as their predecessor rectangles near their bases,
but completely different at the top. To construct the
trapezoids, you mark the height of the function at the 
beginning and end of the width interval (which is still 
calculated by the formula 
) and connect those 
two points. Figure 14.4 shows how the Trapezoidal
Rule approximates the area beneath our favorite func-
tion in the whole world, y = x2 + 1.
There’s a lot less room for error with this rule, and it’s
actually just as easy to use as Riemann sums were. 
One difference—this one requires that you memorize a
formula.

Problem 1: Approximate the area beneath the curve g(x) = –cos x on the interval
using n = 4 rectangles and (1) left sums, (2) right sums, and (3) midpoint sums.
You’ve Got Problems
If you’re dying to know the
actual area beneath y = x2 + 1
on the interval [0,3], it is exactly
12. Of our approximations so
far, the midpoint sum came the
closest (even though we used
only three rectangles with this
method but four with left sums).
Critical Point
This is going to freak you out. Remember how the left and right sums offset one
another when we approximated the area beneath y = x2 + 1—one too big 
and the other too small? Well, the Trapezoidal Rule (with n trapezoids) is exactly the
average of the left and right sums (with n rectangles). We already know that the right
sum of y = x2 + 1 (with n = 3) is 17. You can find the corresponding left sum to be 7.
If you calculate the Trapezoidal Rule approximation (with n = 3 trapezoids), you get
12, which is the average of 7 and 17.
Critical Point

Chapter 14: Approximating Area
The Trapezoidal Rule: The approximate area beneath a continuous curve f(x) on the inter-
val [a,b] using n trapezoids equals 
In practice, you pop the correct numbers into the fraction at the beginning and then evalu-
ate the function at every interval boundary. Except for the endpoints, you’ll multiply all the
values by 2.
The area of any trapezoid is one half of the
height times the sum of the bases (the bases
are the parallel sides). For the trapezoid in 
Figure 14.5, the area is 
. You may 
not be used to seeing trapezoids tipped on
their side like this—in geometry, the bases are 
usually horizontal, not vertical. The reason you see
all those 2’s in the Trapezoidal Rule is that every
base is used twice for consecutive trapezoids except
for the bases at the endpoints.
Let’s go straight into an example, and you’ll see
that the Trapezoidal Rule is not very hard at all.
Just for grins, let’s use f(x) = x2 + 1 yet again to see
if the Trapezoidal Rule can beat out our current
best estimate of 11.75 given by the midpoint sum.
163
Figure 14.4
The “tops” of our approx-
imating shapes are no
longer parallel to the 
x-axis. Instead, they con-
nect the function’s heights
at the interval endpoints. 
There is another way to get
better approximations using
Riemann sums. If you increase
the number of rectangles you
use, the amount of error de-
creases. However, the amount of
calculating you have to do
increases. Eventually, we’ll find a
way to obtain the exact area
without much work at all. It’s
actually rooted in Riemann sums,
but uses an infinite number of rec-
tangles in order to eliminate any
error completely.

Part 4: The Integral
Example 2: Approximate the area beneath f(x) = x2 + 1
on the interval [0,3] using the Trapezoidal Rule with 
n = 5 trapezoids.
Solution: Since you are using five trapezoids, you need
to determine how wide each will be, so apply the Δx
formula:
Therefore, the boundaries of the intervals will start at x = 0 and progress in steps 
of 
and 3. These numbers belong in the formula as a, x1, x2, x3,
x4, and b. So according to the Trapezoidal Rule, the area is approximately:
This is actually the closest approximation yet, although it is a bit too big. Had this curve
been concave down instead of up, the result would have underestimated the area. Can you
see why? The teeny bit of error would have been outside, rather than inside, the curve.

Chapter 14: Approximating Area
Simpson’s Rule
Our final area-approximating tool is Simpson’s Rule. Geometrically, it creates tiny little
parabolas (rather than the slanted trapezoidal interval roofs) to wrap even closer around
the function we’re approximating. The formula is astonishingly similar to the Trapezoidal
Rule, but here’s the catch: you can only use an even number of subintervals.
Simpson’s Rule: The approximate area under the continuous curve f(x) on the closed inter-
val [a,b] using an even number of subintervals, n, is …
In this formula, the outermost terms get multiplied by nothing. However, beginning with
the second term, you multiply consecutive terms by 4, then 2, then 4, then 2, etc. Make
sure you always start with 4, though. Back to Old Faithful, f(x) = x2 + 1, for an example
one more time.
Example 3: Approximate the area beneath that confounded function  f(x) = x2 + 1 on the
closed interval [0,3], this time using Simpson’s Rule and n = 6 subintervals.
Solution: Some quick calculating tells us that our subintervals will have the width of
. Now, to the formula we go:
165
Remember to multiply 
by 4, the next term by 2, etc. However, the first and last terms 
get no additional coefficient:
Whoa! Since Simpson’s Rule uses quadratic approximations, and this is a quadratic function,
you get the exact answer. This only happens for areas beneath quadratic equations, though.

Are you a little perplexed? Probably. We spent the first 13 chapters of the
book discussing complex mathematical procedures, and then suddenly and
without warning, we’re calculating the area of rectangles in Chapter 14. Kind
of a letdown, I know. Most people have this terrifying view of calculus, and
assume that everything in it is impossible to understand; they are usually sur-
prised to be calculating simple areas this deep in the course.
In this chapter, we’ll find exact areas beneath a curve. We’ll also uncover one
of the most fascinating mathematical relationships of all time: The area
beneath a curve is related to the curve’s antiderivative. You heard me right—
antiderivative. After all this time learning how to find the derivative of a func-
tion, now we’re going to go backward and find the antiderivative. Before, we
took f(x) = x3 – 2x2 and got f ′(x) = 3x2 – 4x; now, we’re going to start with the
derivative and figure out the original function.
Chapter

It’s a whole new ballgame, and we’re going to learn everything from the first half of the
course in reverse. For those of us who always seem to do things backwards, this should
come as a welcome change! Sound exciting? Sound painful? It’s a little from column A 
and a little from column B.
The Power Rule for Integration
Before we get started, let’s talk briefly about what reverse differentiating means. The pro-
cess of going from the expression f ′(x) back to f(x) is called antidifferentiation or integration—
both words mean the same thing. The result of the process is called an antiderivative or an
integral. Integration is denoted using a long, stretched out letter S, like this:
This is read “The integral of 2x, with respect to x, is equal to x2 plus some unknown con-
stant” (called the constant of integration). This integral expression is called an indefinite 
integral since there are no boundaries on it, whereas an expression such as 
is
called a definite integral, because it contains the limits of integration 1 and 3. Both expressions
contain a “dx”; don’t worry at all about this little piece—you don’t have to do anything with
it. Just make sure its variable matches the variable in the function (in this case, x).
Part 4: The Integral
168
That’s a lot of vocabulary for now. Before you get overwhelmed, let’s get into the meat of
the mathematics. Remember finding simple derivatives with the Power Rule? There’s a
The opposite of a derivative is called an antiderivative or integral. If f(x) is 
the antiderivative of g(x), then 
. The process of creating such 
an expression is called antidifferentiation or integration. Why do you have to use a
constant of integration? Lots of functions have the same derivative—for example, both 
h(x) = x3 + 6 and j(x) = x3 – 12 have the same derivative, 3x2. Therefore, when we 
integrate 
, we say the antiderivative is x3 + C, since we have no way of know-
ing what constant was in the original function. All indefinite integrals must contain a 
“+ C” in their solution for this reason. An indefinite integral has no boundaries next to
the integration sign. Its solution is an antiderivative. A definite integral has boundaries,
called limits of integration, next to the integration sign. Its solution is a real number. 
For example,

procedures soon.)

way to find simple integrals using the Power Rule for Integration. Instead of multiplying the
original coefficient by the exponent and then subtracting 1 from the power, you’ll add 1 to
the power and divide by the new power.
The Power Rule for Integration: The integral of a single variable to some power is found by
adding 1 to the existing exponent and dividing the variable by the new exponent:
Remember: you can only use the Power
Rule for Integration if you are integrating a
single variable to a power, just like the regu-
lar Power Rule. However, if the only thing
standing in your way is a coefficient, you are
allowed to yank it out of the integral to get it out
of your way, as indicated in the first example.
Example 1: Evaluate 
.
Solution: Even though there are two terms here, each is simply a variable to some power
with a coefficient attached. You can actually separate addition or subtraction problems
into separate integrals as follows:
Don’t worry about the
or dx in the problem. They’re the “bookends” of an integral 
expression, marking where it begins and ends; just integrate whatever falls between them.
Before you can apply the Power Rule for
Integration, you should “pull out” the 
coefficients:
Now the expression in each integral looks
like the one in the Power Rule for Integra-
tion theorem. Add 1 to each power and divide
each variable by its new power. The integral sign
and the “dx” will disappear, but don’t forget to add
“+ C” to the end of the problem, since all indefi-
nite integrals require it:

where. It just hangs around, wait-

Integrating Trigonometric Functions
Just like learning trigonometric derivatives, learning trigonometric integrals just means
memorizing the correct formulas. If you forget them, you can actually create some of them
from scratch easily (like the integral of the tangent function, as you’ll see later in the chap-
ter). However, not all of them are quite so easy to build by yourself, so I see some quality
memorizing time in your not-too-distant future.
I can tell by that unhappy look on your face that the thought of more memorizing doesn’t
excite you. (You’re going to become even more unhappy if you haven’t flipped ahead to the
actual formulas yet—they are crazy-looking.) Think back. You had to memorize the multi-
plication tables in elementary school, remember? This is just sort of the grandfather of the
multiplication tables, but important all the same.

very tricky, so we don’t even attempt that until Chapter 18. That way you have something
to look forward to! (Or dread. Take your pick.)
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
Finally, it’s time to solve two mysteries of recent origin: (1) How do you find exact areas
under curves, and (2) Why are we even mentioning areas—isn’t this chapter about inte-
grals? It turns out that the exact area beneath a curve can be computed using a definite
integral. This is one of two major conclusions, which together make up the Fundamental
Theorem. 
Part One: Areas and Integrals Are Related
After all the time we spent approximating it in Chapter 14, we’re finally going to calculate
the exact area beneath y = x2 + 1 on the interval [0,3] .
From now on, we’re going to equate definite integrals with the area beneath a curve
(technically speaking, the area between the function and the x-axis, remember?). There-
fore, I can say that the area beneath x2 + 1 on the interval [0,3] is equal to 
. 
This new notation is read, “the integral of x2 + 1, with respect to x, from 0 to 3.” Unlike
indefinite integrals, the solution to a definite integral, such as this one, is a number. That
number is, in fact, the area beneath the curve. How in the world do you get that number,
you ask? How about a warm welcome for the Fundamental Theorem?
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (part one):
If g(x) is the antiderivative of the continuous
function f(x), then 
.
In other words, to calculate the area beneath
the curve f(x) on the interval [a,b], you must
first integrate the function. Then, plug the
upper bound (b) into the integral. From this value,
subtract the result you get from plugging the
lower bound (a) into the same integral. It’s 
a brilliantly simple process, as powerful as it 
is elegant.
Example 2: Once and for all, find the exact area beneath the curve f(x) = x2 + 1 on the
interval [0,3] using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
Solution: This problem asks you to evaluate the definite integral:
171
You will get a negative answer
from a definite integral if the
area in question is below the 
x-axis. Whereas the concept of
“negative area” may not make
sense to you, you automatically
assign all area below the x-axis
with a negative value.
Critical Point

Part 4: The Integral
Begin by integrating x2 + 1 using the Power Rule for Integration. When you complete the
integral, you no longer write the integration symbol, and you do not write “+ C.” Instead,
draw a vertical slash to the right of the integral, and copy the limits of integration onto it.
This signifies that the integration portion of the problem is done:
Plug 3 into the function (for both x’s) and subtract 0 plugged into the function: 
172
Part Two: Derivatives and Integrals Are Opposites
I kind of spoiled this revelation for you already—I’m sorry. However, the second major
conclusion of the Fundamental Theorem still holds some surprises. Let’s check out the
theorem first:
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (part two): If f(x) is a continuous and differentiable
function, 
, if a is a real number.
That looks unsightly. Here’s what it means without all the gobbledygook. Let’s say you’re
taking the derivative of a definite integral whose lower bound is a constant (i.e., just a num-
ber) and whose upper bound contains a variable. If you take the derivative of the entire
integral with respect to the variable in the upper bound, the answer will be the function
inside the integral sign (unintegrated), with the upper bound plugged in, multiplied by the
Here are two important properties of definite integrals:

Solution: You don’t have to use the shortcut in part two of the Fundamental Theorem,
but it makes things easier. Notice that the variable expression is in the lower (not the
upper) bound, which is not allowed by the theorem. Therefore, you should swap them
using a property of integrals I discussed earlier in the chapter. It says that flip-flopping the
boundaries of an integral is fine, as long as you multiply the integral by –1.
Since you are deriving with respect to x (and x is in the upper bound) and the lower bound is
a constant, you are clear to apply the new theorem. All you do is plug the upper bound (sin x)
into the function t2 to get (sin x)2, and multiply by the derivative of the upper bound (which
will be cos x). Don’t forget the negative, which stays out in front of everything:
–sin2x ⋅cosx
173
You don’t always have to switch the boundaries and make the integral negative. Only do it
if the constant appears in the upper boundary. What happens if both boundaries contain
variables? If this is the case, you cannot use the shortcut offered by the theorem and must
resort to the long way described in the preceding sidebar.

Calculus part one, and once using part two.

What if you forget this theorem? No problem—you can do Example 3 another way,
working from the inside out (i.e., start with the integration problem and then take the
derivative). You’ll get the same thing. If you apply the Fundamental Theorem (part one)
to the integral, you get:
Take the derivative with respect to x to get –sin2x ⋅cos x. Don’t forget to apply the 
Chain Rule when deriving 
—that’s where cos x comes from.

U-Substitution
At this point, you can’t solve too many integration problems. You should have a handful 
of antiderivatives memorized (such as 
and 
) and 
should have a pretty good grip on the Power Rule for Integration (meaning, for instance, 
you know that 
). However, what do you do if both of those techniques 
fail? You look, with hope glinting in your eyes, to a new method—u-substitution. You’ll 
use u-substitution almost as much as the Power Rule for Integration—it’s a calculus
heavy-hitter.
The key to u-substitution is finding a piece of the function whose derivative is also in the
function. The derivative is allowed to be off by a coefficient, but otherwise must appear in
the function itself.
Here are the steps you’ll follow when u-substituting:
1. Look for a piece of the function whose derivative is also in the function. If you’re
not sure what to use, try the denominator or something being raised to a power in
the function. 
2. Set u equal to that piece of the function and take the derivative with respect to 
nothing. 
3. Use your u and du expressions to replace parts of the original integral, and your new
integral will be much easier to solve.
Example 4: Use u-substitution to find 
(i.e., prove that the integral of tangent is 
equal to 
).
Solution: Set u equal to a piece of the integral whose
derivative is also in the integral. Since sine and cosine
are both present (and the derivative of each is basically
the other function), you could pick either one to be u,
but remember the hint I gave you: if you’re not sure
which expression to choose, pick the denominator or
something to a power. Therefore, set u = cos x and
derive with respect to nothing to get du = –sin x dx. 
There’s the sin x you expected. It, like u = cos x,
appears in the integral. Well, almost. In the original
integral, sin x is positive, so multiply both sides of du =
–sin x dx by –1 so that the sine functions match:
–du = sin x dx
Part 4: The Integral
174
Deriving with respect to nothing
means following the derivative
with a “dx,” “dt,” or similar term,
depending on the variable in
the expression. For example, the
derivative of sin x with respect to
nothing is cos x dx (just add a
“dx”). The derivative of ln t with
respect to nothing is 
. You 
differentiate the same way and
add the extra piece at the end.

The trickiest part of u-substitution is deciding what u should be. If your first choice doesn’t
work, don’t sweat it. Try something else until it works out for you. It eventually will. The
only way to get really good at this is to practice, practice, practice. Eventually, picking the
correct u will become easier.

The Least You Need to Know
◆Integration, like differentiation, has a Power Rule of its own, in which you add 1 to
the exponent and divide by the new exponent.
◆Trigonometric functions have bizarre integrals, some of which are difficult to pro-
duce on your own; therefore, it’s best to memorize them.
Now it’s time to write the original integral with u’s instead of x’s. Instead of sin x, the new
numerator is –du (since –du = sin x dx). The new denominator is u (since u = cos x).
You must use u-substitution to integrate a function containing something other than just
x, just as you had to use the Chain Rule to differentiate such functions. For
example, in the integral 
, the cosine function contains 3x, not just x, so 
set u = 3x and du = 3dx. Only dx is in the original integral, (not 3dx), so solve for dx

Once you learned how to find the slope of a tangent line (a seemingly meaning-
less skill), it probably seemed as though the applications for the derivative would
never stop. You were finding velocity and rates of change (both instantaneous
and average), calculating related variable rates, optimizing functions, determin-
ing extrema, and, all in all, bringing peace and prosperity to the universe.
If you think that it’s about time for applications of definite integrals to start
pouring in, you must be psychic. (Either that or you read the table of con-
tents.) For now, we’ll look at some of the most popular definite integral-
related calculus topics. We’ll start by finding area bounded by two curves
(rather than one curve and the x-axis). Then, we’ll briefly backtrack to topics
we’ve already discussed, but we’ll spice them up a little with what we now
know of integrals. Finally, we’ll look at definite integral functions, also called
accumulation functions.
Chapter

Part 4: The Integral
Calculating Area Between Two Curves
This’ll blow your mind. In fact, when you read it, your very sanity may be called into
question. The thin ribbons of consciousness tying you to this mortal world may stretch
and break, catapulting you into madness, or at least making you lose your appetite.
Perhaps you should sit down before you continue.
You’ve been calculating the area between curves all along without even knowing it. There, I
said it. I hope you’re okay.
If you want to calculate the area between two continu-
ous curves, we’ll call them f(x) and g(x), on the same 
x-interval [a,b], here’s what you do. Set up a definite
integral as you did last chapter, with a and b as the 
lower and upper limits of integration, respectively.
You’ll stick either f(x) – g(x) or g(x) – f(x) inside the
integral. To decide which one to use, you have to graph
the functions—you should subtract the lower graph
from the higher graph. For example, in Figure 16.1,
g(x) is below f(x) on the interval [a,b].
178
Figure 16.1
At least on the interval
[a,b], the graph of f(x) is
always higher than the
graph of g(x).
Watch out! If you subtract the functions in the wrong order you’ll get a negative answer,
and you should never get a negative answer when finding the area between curves, even if
some of that area falls below the x-axis. 
What if the curves switch places? For example, look at the graph in Figure 16.2. To the left
of x = c, f(x) is above g(x), but when x > c, the functions switch places and g(x) is on top.
If you have functions containing
y instead of functions contain-
ing x (i.e., f(y) = y2), you can
still calculate the area between
the functions. However, instead
of subtracting top minus bottom
inside the integral, you subtract
right minus left.
Critical Point

Chapter 16: Applications of the Fundamental Theorem
To find the shaded area, you’ll have to use
two separate definite integrals, one for the
interval [a,c], when f(x) is on top, and one
for [c,b], when g(x) is: 
.
Example 1: Calculate the area between the func-
tions f(x) = sin 2x and g(x) = cos x on the
interval 
.
Solution: These graphs play leapfrog all along the
x-axis, but on the interval 
, g(x) is defi-
nitely above f(x) (see Figure 16.3).
179
Figure 16.2
The graphs take turns on
the top bunk—neither is
above the other on the
entire interval.
Therefore, the integral will contain 
. Split this up into 
separate integrals: 
. The first is easy:
You have to use u-substitution to integrate sin 2x, setting u = 2x:
The reason we’ve technically
been doing this all along is
that we’ve always been finding
the area between the curve and
the x-axis, which has the equation
g(x) = 0. Thus, if a function f(x)
is above the x-axis on [a,b], the
area beneath the two curves is 
. That second
equation with a value of 0 has
been invisible all this time.

Part 4: The Integral
Don’t forget to change your x boundaries into u boundaries when you u-substitute. 
For example, to get the new u boundary of 4π, plug the old x boundary of 2π into the u
equation: u = 2(2π) = 4π. The final answer is the first integral minus the second: 
.

The Mean Value Theorem for Integration
Think back to the original Mean Value Theorem from Chapter 13. It said that some-
where on an interval, the derivative was equal to the average rate of change for the whole
interval. It turns out that integration has its own version of a Mean Value Theorem, but
since integration involves area instead of rates of change, it’s a bit different.
A Geometric Interpretation
In essence, the Mean Value Theorem for Integration states that at some point along an
interval [a,b], there exists a certain point (c, f(c)) between a and b (see Figure 16.4). If you
draw a rectangle whose base is the interval [a,b] and whose height is f(c), the area of that
rectangle will be exactly the area beneath the function on [a,b].
Problem 1: Calculate the area between the curves y = x2 and y = x3 in the first quad-
rant.

The Mean Value Theorem for Integration: If a
function f(x) is continuous on the interval
[a,b], then there exists c, a ≤c ≤b, such that

This Mean Value Theorem, like its prede-
cessor, is only an existence theorem. It guarantees
that the value x = c and the corresponding key
height f(c) exist. You may wonder why it’s so
important that a curvy graph and a plain old rec-
tangle must always share the same area. We’ll get
to that after the next example.
Example 2: Find the value f(c) guaranteed by the
Mean Value Theorem for Integration for the 
function f(x) = x3 – 4x2 + 3x + 4 on the interval [1,4].
Solution: The Mean Value Theorem for Integration states that there is a c between a and
b so that 
. You know everything except what c is, but that’s okay.
Plug in everything you know:
After the quick subtraction problem on the left (and the slightly lengthier definite integral
on the right), you should get …

In the Mean Value Theorem for
Integration (b – a) represents
the length of the rectangle,
since it is the length of the inter-
val [a,b]. The height of the rec-
tangle is, as we’ve already
discussed, f(c). There may be
more than one such c in the inter-
val that satisfies the Mean Value
Theorem for Integration, but there
must be at least one.

Part 4: The Integral
This means that the area beneath the curve 
f(x) = x3 – 4x2 + 3x + 4 on the interval [1,4] (which is 
)
is equal to the area of the rectangle whose length is the
same as the interval’s length (3) and whose height is 
.
182
The Average Value Theorem
The value f(c) that you found in both Example 2 and Problem 2 has a special name. It is
called the average value of the function. If you take the Mean Value Theorem for Integra-
tion and divide both sides of it by (b – a), you’ll get the equation for average value:
This is simply a different form of our previous equation, so it doesn’t warrant a whole lot
more attention. However, some textbooks completely skip over the Mean Value Theorem
for Integration and go right to this, which they call the Average Value Theorem. They
might word Problem 2 above as follows: “Find the average value of 
on the
interval [1,100].” You’d solve the problem the exact same way (see Figure 16.5).
If Example 2 had asked you to
find the c-value rather than the
value of f(c), you’d still follow 
the same steps. At the 
end, however, you’d plug the
point (c, 
) into f(x) and solve 
for c.

Problem 2: Find the value f(c) guaranteed by the Mean Value Theorem for Integration 
on the function 
on the interval [1,100].
You’ve Got Problems
The average value of a function is the value f(c) guaranteed by the Mean Value
Theorem for Integration (the height of the rectangle of equal area). The average
value is found via the equation 
. Think of it this way. Most functions twist
and turn throughout their domains. If you could “level out” a function by filling in its val-
leys and flattening out its peaks until the function was a horizontal line, the height of
that line (i.e., its y-value) would be the average value for that function.

Chapter 16: Applications of the Fundamental Theorem
Finding Distance Traveled
Definite integrals also play well with position and velocity functions. Remember that
derivatives measure a rate of change. Well, it turns out that definite integrals of rate of
change functions measure accumulated change. For example, if you are given a function
that represents the rate of sales of the new must-have toy, the Super Fantastic Hula Hoop,
then the definite integral gives you the actual number of hula hoops sold.
Most often, however, math teachers like to explore this property of integrals as it applies to
motion. Specifically, the definite integral of the velocity function of an object gives you the
total displacement of the object. A word of caution: you will most often be asked to find the
total distance traveled by the object—not the total displacement. To calculate the total dis-
tance, you’ll first have to determine where the object changes direction (using a wiggle
graph) and then integrate the velocity separately on every interval that direction changes.
183
Figure 16.5
Here’s the diagram for the
Mean Value Theorem for
Integration once more.
The height of the dotted
line is the function’s aver-
age value. Although the
function dips below and
shoots above f(c), that’s how
high f(x) is on average.
Here’s the difference between total distance traveled and total displacement. Let’s say
at any hour t, I want to know (in miles) how far I am away from my favorite bright
orange ‘70s-style easy chair that my wife hates. My initial position (i.e., t = 0 hours) is
in the chair, so s(0) = 0. Two hours later, I am at work, 50 miles away from my chair,
so s(2) = 50 miles. Once my workday and commute home are complete, I am back
home in the chair, and s(12) = 0. I have traveled a total distance of 100 miles, count-
ing my travel away from the chair and back again. However, my displacement is 0.
Displacement is the total change in position counting only the beginning and ending
position; if the object in question changes direction any time during that interval of time,
displacement does not correctly reflect the total distance traveled.

Part 4: The Integral
Example 3: In the book The Fellowship of the Ring by J.R.R. Tolkien, a young hobbit
named Frodo embarks on an epic, exciting, and hairy-footed adventure to destroy the
One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom. Based on a little estimation and the book The
Journeys of Frodo: An Atlas of J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings by Barbara Strachey, I
have designed an equation modeling Frodo’s journey. During the first four days of his
journey (from Hobbiton to the home of Tom Bombadil), his velocity (in miles per day) is
given by the equation: 
v(t) = – 15.5t3 + 86.25t2 – 117.25t + 48.75
For example, v(2) gives his approximate velocity at the exact end of the second day. Find
the total distance Frodo travels from t = 0 to t = 4. 
Solution: Since you want to find the total distance traveled, you need to determine if
Frodo changed direction at any point, and actually started to wander toward Hobbiton
rather than away. This is not necessarily caused by poor hobbit navigation, but perhaps by
hindrances such as the old forest, getting caught in trees, etc. To see if his direction
changed, create a wiggle graph for velocity (see Figure 16.6).
184
Figure 16.6
The hobbits have a pretty
good sense of direction; in
fact, they are heading far-
ther and farther away from
Hobbiton until just before
the end of the fourth day.
Integrate the velocity equation separately, on both of these intervals. Because they are
heading slightly backwards (i.e., toward their beginning point) on the interval (3.78586,4),
that definite integral will be negative. However, since it still represents the distance the
hobbits are traveling, you don’t want it to be subtracted from your answer, so turn it into
its opposite by multiplying it by –1. You should do this for any negative pieces of your wig-
gle graph in this type of problem. Therefore, the distance traveled will be
Even though the numbers are darn ugly, the premise is very simple. I’ll leave the figuring
up to you. You should get 108.298 for the first interval (distance away from Hobbiton)
and –(–3.298) for the second, which is the small distance back toward Hobbiton; the sum
is 111.596 miles.

Accumulation Functions
Before we close out this chapter and make it a fond memory, let’s talk about accumulation
functions. You’ll probably see a few of them lurking around contemporary calculus classes,
as they are now “in” since the advent of calculus reform. An accumulation function is a defi-
nite integral with a variable expression in one or more of its limits of integration. They are
called accumulation functions because they get their value by accumulating area beneath
curves, as do all definite integrals.
Practically speaking, you should be able to eval-
uate and differentiate these functions, so let’s
get to it. Believe it or not, evaluating accumula-
tion functions is just as easy as evaluating any
other function—just plug in the correct x-value. 
Once you plug in the value, you’ll apply the
Fundamental Theorem to the resulting definite
integral. For example, if you are given the function
and asked to find f(4), you

Right about now, you’re seeing that the numbers in this problem are not easy, whole
numbers. They rarely turn out to be so in real-world (or Middle Earth) examples. Since
calculus reform (a new movement among many mathematicians to make calculus more
realistic and to embrace electronic calculation technology) tackles problems such as
these, I wanted to throw in one or two problems that are much simpler if you use technol-
ogy. There are those who would have me burned at the mathematical stake for suggesting
such a thing. In fact, I was once yelled at fiercely by the lunch ladies in the high school
cafeteria where I worked for suggesting that you should use a calculator to check your
answers when converting fractions to decimals. I’ve never received fewer tater tots than I
did that day. Lunch ladies can be so bitter.

to hurl themselves back toward earth.) Let’s say that a ship executing this maneuver has

sands of miles from earth. What is the total distance traveled by the craft during the first

Let’s be honest with each other for a moment. Integration sort of stinks. In
fact, integration really stinks. It is much harder than taking derivatives (it’s not
just your imagination), because there is rarely a clear-cut way to integrate an
expression if you can’t use the Power Rule. With derivatives, if you have a
fraction, you apply the Quotient Rule—end of story. No one’s confused;
everyone’s happy. It’s not the same with integrals.
If you’re given an expression that can’t be integrated with the Power Rule or
basic u-substitution, there’s a choice to be made. That choice is: what the heck
do you try next? Although the vast majority of calculus problems you’ll
encounter can be integrated by one of those first methods, there is a plethora,
a smorgasbord, a buffet of alternate techniques for finding integrals. Though
none are really hard, none are as clear-cut as differentiation.
When integrating a fraction, there is no hard-and-fast rule that is applied
every time. In fact, the methods available for integrating fractions are nearly
endless. However, this chapter will add three of the most popular tools 
used to integrate fractions to your integral toolbox. If you were trying to drive

metaphoric equivalent of an integration screwdriver, here come the integration chisel,
socket wrench, and needle-nose pliers.
Separation
Breaking up is hard to do, but under specific circumstances, it is really quite worthwhile.
Sometimes things just don’t work out, and fractions have to go their separate ways. After a
long, sunny time in the numerator together, terms just want a little more “me” time and
some personal space. However, after all the time they’ve spent together, they’ve saved up
a little bundle in the denominator, and both want to walk away with it. The good news is,
in the math world, both pieces of the numerator get a full share of the denominator—no
lawyers, no haggling over how it should be broken up. Both terms of the numerator walk
away with a full denominator, and are a little wiser for having gotten involved in the first
place.
188
Top-heavy integrals (i.e., lots of terms in the numerator but only one in the denominator)
and other fractional integrals are occasionally easier to solve if you split the larger fraction
into smaller, more manageable ones. Although the original problem couldn’t be solved via
u-substitution or the Power Rule, the smaller integrals usually can.
Example 1: Find 
using the 
separation technique.
Solution: This is a fraction, so the Power Rule for
Integration doesn’t apply, and setting the numerator 
or denominator equal to u is not going to do a 
whole lot for you, so u-substitution is out. If, 
however, you separate the five terms of the large nu-
merator into five separate fractions, watch what 
happens:

Tricky U-Substitution and Long Division
When we first discussed u-substitution, I made it a point to say that the derivative of u
must appear in the problem. This is usually true, so I wasn’t technically lying. There is,
however, a way to use u-substitution, even if it’s not the most obvious choice.
Example 2: Find

Solution: For grins, go ahead and try to find the antiderivative using u-substitution. Remem-
ber the tip: if you’re not sure what to set equal to u, try the denominator. Therefore, 
u = x – 2 and du = dx. If you make the appropriate substitutions back into the problem,
you get:
To be honest, it doesn’t look much better than the original, does it? Don’t give up,
though; you’re not out of options. Go back to your u equation and solve it for x to get:
u = x – 2
x = u + 2

a little cheerier:
At least all of the variables are the same now. That’s a relief. Can you see where to go
from here? This fraction is top-heavy, with lots of terms in the numerator but only one in
the denominator, so you can use the separation method from the last section to finish.
What a happy “coincidence” that you just learned it!
You may be wondering why the –4 vanished in the last
step of Example 2. Remember that C is some constant
you don’t know. If you subtract 4 from that, you’ll get
some other number (which is 4 less than the original
mystery number). Since I still don’t know the value for
C, I just write it as C again, instead of writing C – 4.
There are alternatives when integrating fractions like
these. In fact, you can begin a rational integral by
applying long division; it helps to simplify the problem
if the numerator’s degree is greater than or equal to the
denominator’s degree. It works like a charm if the denominator is not a single term, as is the
case with Example 2.
Since the degree of the numerator (1) is greater than or equal to the degree of the
denominator (1), begin by dividing 2x – 1 by x – 2:

Integrating with Inverse Trig Functions
Let me preface this section with a bit of perspective. You are not going to have to inte-
grate using inverse trigonometric functions very often. In fact, you will probably use the
formulas you’re about to learn less often than the average male college student does laun-
dry during one semester, and that’s not a very big number, let me tell you. However, every
once in a blue moon, you’ll see a telltale sign in an integral problem—a particular finger-
print that tells you inverse trig functions will be part of your solution.
Way back when you were memorizing trig derivatives in Chapter 9, I threw the inverse
function derivatives in at the end of the list. Hopefully you did, indeed, memorize them,
or at least can pick them out of a lineup of the usual suspects. As we have done in 
previous sections, we are going to now backtrack from the derivative to the original
inverse trig function. For example, since 
, we automatically know that 
.
Don’t think that we’re limited to only that formula, however. The denominator does not
have to be 1 + x2 in order to use the arctangent formula. Any constant can take the place
of 1, and just about any function can replace the x2. They’re going to seem a little confus-
ing, but I need to show you the formulas we’ll be using before we get into examples. The
examples will make everything a lot clearer; trust me.
In each of these formulas, a represents a constant and u represents a function (I use u to
represent the function to remind you that you’ll have to do u-substitution for all of these
inverse trig integral problems):

Part 4: The Integral
These formulas represent identification patterns. If you see an integral with a square root
in the denominator, and inside that square root is a number minus a squared function,
alarm bells should go off in your head. This pattern
matches the first formula, and may be integrated using
the arcsine formula. If instead you have a denominator
with a number plus a function squared but no square
root, arctangent may be the way to go. Remember,
there is no easy way to tell what integration method to
use every time, so don’t be discouraged if your first
attempt doesn’t work—just try another technique you’ve
learned until something sticks.
Example 3: Evaluate 
.
Solution: You should aim for an arcsine integral for two reasons: (1) a square root contain-
ing subtraction in the denominator, and (2) the subtraction follows the order “constant
minus function squared,” suggesting the arcsine rather than the arcsecant function, whose
subtraction order is reversed. Match this problem up with your new arcsine formula,
ignoring the numerator for now. Because 4 must be the a2 term, a = 2; similarly, u = cos x.
As I mentioned earlier, the presence of the function u reminds you to do u-substitution,
so du = –sin x dx and –du = sin x dx. Using these three statements, you can rewrite the 
integral:
This now exactly matches the formula for arcsine (the coefficient of –1 doesn’t affect the
contents of the integral, which are a perfect match), so you know:
192
Pay attention to the order of
subtraction if a radical
appears in the denominator. In
arcsine, you’ll have a constant
minus the function, whereas the
order is reversed in arcsecant.

Completing the Square
Most people hate fractions, even if they don’t remember why anymore. I have finally
graduated to only hating fractions of fractions. Did you ever notice that all gasoline prices
are fractions of fractions? The big sign may say gas is $1.25 a gallon, but if you look
closer, you’ll see that it reads $1.25 and 
of a cent. But that is neither here nor there.
Integration might be getting on your nerves almost as much as fractions. The fabulous
combination of integrating fractions is stressful enough to cause your eye to twitch and
that voice in your head to take a different tone. If your patience with integration really
started to thin out when you read about inverse trig functions, then completing the square
at the same time you’re integrating may just push you over the edge.
I have good news. The integration methods we’ll learn in the next chapter are completely
new, and actually kind of fun. To be honest, I think the methods we’ve learned to inte-
grate fractions in this chapter are kind of a drag. But, as they say, it’s not a personality
contest, so we might as well grin and bear it through one more topic. Before you read on,
make sure to review the section on completing the square from Chapter 2, and reread
those formulas from the last section we did on inverse trig integration.
Integrating by completing the square is a useful technique in one specific circumstance—if
you have a quadratic polynomial in the denominator and no variable at all in the numera-
tor. The process itself is nothing more than a combination of things you’ve already done,
but the process is not obvious to most people (including me) so it’s worth working
through an example.
Example 4: Find 
by complet-
ing the square.
Solution: In order to complete the square
in the denominator, the coefficient of the x2
term must be 1, so factor a 3 out of the entire
quadratic. While you’re at it, go ahead and pull
that 4 out of the top:
Now focus on the denominator. According to the completing the square procedure from
Chapter 2, you should take half of –2 and square it to get 1. To avoid changing the value
of the fraction, you must both add and subtract 1 in the denominator:

Part 4: The Integral
Now factor x2 – 2x + 1 and combine –1 + 10 to get:
Notice that this is a fraction with a squared function added to a constant in its denomina-
tor. Sound familiar? You can apply the arctangent integral formula from the last section,
with u = x – 1 and a = 3. Remember to do u-substitution; in this case, du = dx, so no
adjustments to du are necessary:
194
Selecting the Correct Method
Trying to decide which technique to use when integrating fractions feels like trying to
build a boat after it’s already started to flood. The longer it takes, the less motivated you
are to try and finish the job. Just remember that it takes time and practice. The smallest
difference between integrals completely changes the way you approach the problem.
For example, consider the integral 
. The best way to solve this is via the 
arctangent formula with u = x and a = 4. However, consider the integral 
. Here, 
completing the square won’t work! In fact, u-substitution is the best solution technique.
It’s hard to believe that simply adding one little “x” to the numerator completely changes 
the approach. How about 
? Now only long division will get you to the correct 
answer, since the degree of the numerator is greater than or equal to that of the denominator.
When push comes to shove with fraction integration, don’t panic. Realize going into the
problem that you may have to integrate a couple of times using a couple of different
methods before it works out correctly. However, you should be able to tackle most of
them now, as long as you’re patient.

Without a doubt, my students always hated the integration methods in
Chapter 17. It was probably their least favorite section, even though they
admitted it wasn’t the hardest. The biggest complaint they expressed was how
similar the problems were, but how different the processes were that solved
them. It didn’t help that those methods aren’t used that often, since it afforded
hardly any opportunity to practice later in the course.
All this dislike of those topics actually helped them better understand the
things we’ll learn in this chapter. Integration by parts and by partial fractions
are two of the most interesting things in calculus. For a reason that I can’t
explain, what you’re going to learn about integration now makes the older
stuff look like drudgery. Among the things you’ll learn is one of the greatest
(and most secret) calculus tricks of all time. While some instructors will 
mention it in passing, few willingly explain it in class.
Chapter

Part 4: The Integral
There’s something about math teachers that compels them to do things the longest and
most difficult way possible. I’ve never quite decided if that’s a good or bad thing, to be
honest. In the words of another of my college professors, “Sure, math is hard, but why is
hard bad?” (Did I mention that he was Austrian, so much of what he said, no matter how
benign, made him sound like an evil supervillain? “Ah, Michael, you seem to have forgot-
ten your constant of integration; I will have to remove your eyes and eat them in front of
you ….”) The thing is, math doesn’t have to be so hard. Not when you know some of the
tricks.
Integration by Parts
Even with all the integration methods we know so far, you’re still going to encounter
integrals you can’t solve. It’s a frustrating feeling, like trying to swim out of quicksand.
The more you struggle, the more you realize that your struggling isn’t getting you any-
where. Well, the best defense against quicksand
(according to the Worst-Case Scenario Survival Handbook)
is a “stout pole,” which you can stretch across the sand’s
surface and use to regain some leverage. Integrating by
parts is your stout pole in the face of disgusting integra-
tion problems; you’ll likely use it often, and you’ll grow
to depend on it. In fact, it’ll become so handy, you’ll
probably end up using it to integrate things that could
be done much more simply. However, pole in hand, you
won’t care, as you march confidently into the sunset.
(Curtain drops. Orchestra plays fanfare. House lights come
up to thunderous applause.)
The Brute Force Method
Your goal in integration by parts is to split the integral’s contents into two pieces (including
the dx but not the integral sign itself). One of the pieces (which we’ll call u) should be
easy to differentiate. The other piece (which we’ll call dv) should be easy to integrate.
Sometimes this process will require a little experimentation. Next, you’ll differentiate u
to get du (just like in u-substitution), and integrate dv to get v. Finally, plug all of those 
things into the integration by parts formula: ∫u dv = uv – ∫v du.
On the left side will be your original integral, so the right side represents a different (yet
equivalent) way to rewrite it. It’s sort of like the long division method you’ve already
learned—this step allows you to rewrite the integral in a much more manageable (and
slightly longer) form.
198
Integration by parts allows you
to rewrite the integral ∫u dv
(where u is an easily differenti-
ated function and dv is one easily
integrated) as uv – ∫v du. I call
this formula the “brute force”
method, because the tabular
method you’ll learn soon, by
comparison, is much slicker.

Chapter 18: Advanced Integration Methods
Example 1: Find the solution to ∫x sin x dx using integration by parts.
Solution: Either of these two pieces is easily integrated by itself, but together, they’re
trouble. You cannot rewrite the integral ∫x sin x dx as ∫x dx ⋅∫sin x dx—only addition
and subtraction inside the integral can be split up into separate integrals.
Even u-substitution is a bust. Of course, none of your fraction methods will work.
Time for parts—set u = x and dv = sin x dx. Even though you can integrate x and differen-
tiate sine, it’s usually best to pick a u that gets less complicated when you take the derivative.
Therefore, differentiate u to get du = dx and integrate the dv equation to get v = –cos x.
(Don’t worry about the + C for now—we’ll stick that in at the end.) Substitute these into
the parts formula and solve the simple integral that results:
 
 
 
 
199
I promised you before that I’d tell you how to integrate the natural log function using
parts. Set u = ln x and dv = dx. (Your dv term should always include the dx, even if that’s all
it includes.) Therefore, du = 
dx and v = x. According to the parts formula, ∫ln x dx
can be rewritten as x ln x – ∫x ⋅
dx, so integrate:
 
The integration by parts formula actually comes from the Product Rule. Let’s say you
have two functions, called u(x) and v(x). According to the Product Rule,
. If you integrate both sides of the equation, you get 
uv = ∫u dv + ∫v du, and solving that equation for ∫u dv gives you the parts formula.
Of course, all of the necessary “+ C” terms are left out—you’ll have to pop one of
those on at the end if you’re dealing with an indefinite integral.

Problem 1: Find the solution to ∫x2 ex dx; you’ll have to apply integration by parts
twice, because the integral that results from the parts method can only be integrated by
using parts again!

Part 4: The Integral
The Tabular Method
There is a much easier way to do integration by parts problems, but a word of caution
must precede it. This method will not work for all integration by parts problems. If the
term you pick to be u does not eventually equal 0 when you take multiple derivatives, it
will not work. In this procedure, you still begin by deciding upon the u and dv pieces the
same way. Then, you draw a table with three columns, labeled “u,” “dv,” and “±1.” 
In the first row of the table, write the u term in the first
column, the dv term in the second, and a +1 in the
third. In the second row, you’ll write the derivative of
the u term, the integral of the dv term, and this time a
–1 in the ±1 column. In the third row, you take yet
another derivative, another integral, and switch back to
a +1.
So the u column contains u and its successive derivatives—f(x), f′(x), f″(x), etc.—the dv
column contains and its successive integrals (g(x), ∫g(x) dx, ∫(∫g(x) dx)dx), and the final
column begins with a +1 and alternates between –1 and +1 after that. Eventually, your 
u column will become 0. The first row that contains a 0 for u will be the last row in your
table, except for one additional +1 or –1 in its own row. Figure 18.1 is the table generated
by Example 1 (∫x sinx dx).

The first row contains the
original u and dv statements,
and the next rows contain

Now draw a series of arrows that begin with the u term and go southeast from there, hitting
the middle column of the second row and the third column of the third row. Multiply these
things together to get one term of your answer, x(–cos x)(+1) = –x cos x. To get the second term
of the answer, draw a similar arrow beginning with the second row: 1(–sin x)(–1) = sin x. There
is no third term, because a 0 stands in that position, so the final answer is –x cos x + sin x + C.
Notice that this is the same answer you got the “long way” in Example 1.
Don’t forget to slap on a 
“+ C” when you’re integrat-
ing by parts, if the original inte-
gral is indefinite.

Integration by Partial Fractions
I hope there’s still space left in your brain for one more fraction integration topic. Truth
be told, it’s actually kind of neat (the way that reading books like Lord of the Flies would be
neat if your literature grade didn’t depend on how well you understood the symbolism in
it). Way back in algebra, you learned how to add rational expressions. For example, in
order to add 
to 
, you’d have to get a
common denominator of (x + 1)(x – 5) and
simplify like so:
Now we’re going to learn how to go from 
to 
. The process is called
partial fraction decomposition, and it is a great way to integrate a fraction whose denomina-
tor is factorable.
Example 2: Use partial fraction decomposition to find 
.
Solution: The denominator will not always be factored for you, but in this case it is. It is
composed of two linear factors (x and x – 1), one of which is squared. In the process of
partial fractions, this is called a repeating factor. You can rewrite 
as a sum of three
fractions whose denominators are individual factors of the original denominator:
The A, B, and C are unknown constants. It is your goal to find them by solving that equa-
tion. To make things easier, multiply both sides of the equation by x2 ( x – 1):
x + 2 = Ax(x – 1) + B(x – 1) + Cx2
x + 2 = Ax2 – Ax + Bx – B + Cx2
x + 2 = x2(A + C) + x(B – A) – B
Notice that you should group the terms by factoring out common variables. This makes
things easier. Remember, both sides of the equation must be equal, and since there is no
x2 term on the left, then there can’t be one on the right, meaning A + C = 0. Also, the

You can tell how much time the
tabular method saves you com-
pared to the brute force method.
If your table is longer than
three full rows, then each addi-
tional row represents a time
you’d have to reapply integration
by parts in the same problem.
Critical Point

Part 4: The Integral
x term on the left has coefficient 1, so the same must be true on the right: B – A = 1.
Similarly, 2 = –B, so B = –2 (i.e., the constants on both sides must be equal). Since you
know B, you can find A:
B – A = 1
(–2) – A = 1
–A = 3
A = –3
202
Finally, because A + C = 0, C = 3. Now, plug these values into the partial fraction formula:
The original fraction can be rewritten as three smaller fractions, each of which can be
integrated using the natural log formula or the Power Rule for Integration:
As you can see, the whole point of partial fraction decomposition is to break down the
problem into manageable fractions. One word of caution: You only use numerators of A,
Partial fraction decomposition is a method of rewriting a fraction as a sum and dif-
ference of smaller fractions, whose denominators are factors of the original, larger
denominator. If a factor in the denominator is raised to a power, it is called
a repeating factor. The factor (x + a)n will show up n times in partial fraction de-
composition, with ascending powers, beginning from 1. In other words, if the de-
nominator contains the repeating factor (x – 3)5, your decomposition will contain 
. Even though these powers get high, you still
consider the factors linear, since there is still a degree of 1 inside the parentheses. In
Example 2, the repeating factor is x, which is why x and x2 show up in separate 
fractions.

Chapter 18: Advanced Integration Methods
B, and C when the denominators are linear factors (repeated or not). The numerator of a
partial fraction is always one degree less than the denominator, and a constant numerator
(degree 0) with a linear denominator (degree 1) fits that description. If one of the factors
in the denominator is a quadratic, then you will use a linear numerator (like Ax + B) for
that partial fraction. For instance, here’s a sample decomposition of a fraction containing a
quadratic repeated factor:
203
Improper Integrals
There are lots of reasons that an integral can be termed improper. For example, integrals
that make loud, sucking sounds through their teeth at the dinner table while boisterously
discussing their views on current events are most certainly improper. Not to mention inte-
grals that tailgate you so closely on the road that you can almost read their upper limit of
integration in your rearview mirror. However, we don’t usually get to observe this sort of
rude behavior from our mathematical symbols, so we must content ourselves with observ-
ing telltale mathematical signs that integrals are improper. The two most common indica-
tors of an improper integral are infinite discontinuities and infinite limits of integration.
In essence, either the integration boundaries of the problem or one of the numbers
between the boundaries causes trouble. In the integral problem 
, the impropriety is 
obvious. Sure, you can integrate the fraction to get 
, but how are you supposed to
plug ∞into that? Infinity is not a number!
Can you spot the problem in the integral: 
? Again, integration is no sweat 
(u-substitution and the natural log function work time), but it doesn’t make sense for –4 to be
an integration boundary. The function 
doesn’t even exist at –4, so how can there be 
area under there?
Believe it or not, integrals that look like 
sometimes actually represent 
a finite area (although neither of those two do). In order to solve them, however, we’ll
have to revisit an old, old friend. After all this time, limits have come back to haunt you,
like that breakfast burrito from yesterday morning. 
Problem 3: Integrate

Part 4: The Integral
Example 3: Evaluate 
even though it is an improper integral.
Solution: This integral is improper because its lower boundary (4) is a point of infinite
discontinuity on the function being integrated. To remedy this, replace the troublesome 
boundary with the generic constant a, and allow a to approach 4 using a limit: 
. 
(Technically, you have to approach 4 from the right, since the graph doesn’t exist to the
left of 4.)
204
It might feel like you are cheating, but you are not. The lower limit is not 4 anymore—
now it’s a number insanely close to, but not quite, 4. Proceed with the integration using 
u-substitution with u = x – 4 and du = dx (don’t forget to plug the boundaries into the u
equation to get u boundaries):
You’ve ignored the limit long enough. To finish, use the substitution method from
Chapter 6:
In Example 3, the integral is improper because of one of its boundaries. You 
may also have problems with the values between an integral’s boundaries. For 
example, 
is not improper because of the boundaries of –2 or 1, but 
because the function 
has an infinite discontinuity at x = 0, which falls between 
the boundaries. To solve a problem like that, you’d split the integral into two pieces,
each piece of which would contain the troublesome boundary. For notation purposes
only, we’ll use a left-hand limit for the left piece of the integral and a right-hand limit for
the right piece.

Volumes of Rotational Solids 
Have you ever seen one of those tissue paper accordion-style decorations? They start out
as a two-dimensional cardboard shape, but as you open them, you get this cool-looking
three-dimensional design. I see them most often in wedding receptions—little tissue sta-
lactites hanging from hotel ballroom ceilings. For those of you who go to classier wed-
dings than I, or have no idea what I’m referring to (these decorations are not as hot as
they were during the ’70s), Figure 19.1 can be used as a visual aid.
208
Figure 19.1
When a simple shape is
rotated in three dimen-
sions about an axis, it can
create this wedding bell—
a geometric reminder of
your inability to commit.
Our goal is to find the volume of shapes like these. We’ll start with a function graph and
rotate the area it captures around a horizontal or vertical axis, much like the area of the
half-bell above is rotated around its vertical axis.
The Disk Method
As long as the rotational solid resulting from your graph has no hollow space in it, you
can use the disk method to calculate its volume. The key to these problems is finding the
radius of rotation, a length beginning at the rotational axis and extending to the outer edge
of the area that’s rotated. In the disk method, the radius of rotation will always be perpen-
dicular to the rotational axis.

Chapter 19: Applications of Integration
It’s very easy to locate and draw the radius of rotation, and doing so is an important step
for any rotational solid problem. Once you find it, all you have to do is plug into the disk 
method formula: 
(where a and b are the x-boundaries of the area you’re 
rotating).
209
Example 1: Rotate the area bounded by f(x) = –x2 + 4 and the x-axis about the x-axis, and
calculate the volume that results.
If you can’t visualize it, the solid resulting from the rotation described by Example 1 looks
like Figure 19.2.
Figure 19.2
Don’t worry—your grade
won’t be dependent upon
how well you can draw
three-dimensional figures.
Solution: Start by drawing everything and find the radius of rotation, as shown in Fig-
ure 19.3.
The radius of rotation is a line segment extending from the axis of rotation to the edge
of the area being rotated. If this radius is vertical, it means that all of the functions
you’re dealing with must contain x-variables. On the other hand, if the radius of rotation
is horizontal, you must use functions of y. The disk method is based on the fact that a
rotational solid with no hollow spots will always have a circular cross section. In
essence, you are integrating its cross-sectional area (which is πr2, the area of a circle).

Part 4: The Integral
The shaded region is the area that will be rotated about
the x-axis. The dark line is radius of rotation—it
extends from the axis of rotation (the x-axis) up to the
edge of the graph f(x). Even though I’ve drawn the
radius at x = 1, it will have the same defining formula
anywhere on [–2,2]. Notice that the radius of rotation is
perpendicular to the rotational axis, which is horizontal. 
Find the length of the radius of rotation, r(x), using the
same reasoning you did when finding the area between
curves: its length is the top curve minus the bottom
curve. Since the top curve is f(x) = –x2 + 4 and the bot-
tom curve is the x-axis (g(x) = 0), the radius of rotation is
r(x) = f(x) – g(x) = –x2 + 4 – 0 = –x2 + 4. According to the
disk method, the volume of the rotational solid will be:
Notice that the radius of rotation was vertical. This indicates that you had to use 
x-functions. Had it been horizontal, all of your functions would have to be in terms of y—
i.e., f(y) instead of f(x). The only other difference with horizontal radii is that you find

of
rotation
The equation of a semicircle,
centered at the origin, 
of radius r is 
. 
If you rotate the region under
the graph of this equation about
the x-axis and treat r like a number
(it’s a constant, not a variable),
you’ll get the equation for the vol-
ume of a sphere:

where that dang formula comes
from.

their lengths by subtracting the right function minus the left function, rather than top

The Washer Method
If a solid of revolution has any hollow spots in
it, you’ll have to use a modified version of the disk
method, called the washer method. It gets its name
from the fact that the cross sections look like
washers (i.e., they have holes or hollow spaces in
their middles). Come to think of it, this process
not only is a lifesaver; it can also find the volume
of one!
Just like the disk method, the radius of rotation in
the washer method must be perpendicular to the
axis of rotation. Again, the orientation of that
radius will tell you what variables to use in
your calculations (vertical means x’s and
horizontal means y’s). The only difference is
that in the new method, you’ll actually have
two radii of rotation. One radius stretches
from the axis of rotation to the outside edge
of the area being rotated (just like before);
this is called the outer radius. The other radius 
of rotation also originates from the rotational 
axis, but stretches to the inner edge of the area
being rotated; this is called the inner radius. The
formula for washer method subtracts the square
of the inner radius from the square of the outer
radius: 
Problem 1: Find the volume of the rotational solid generated by rotating the area in the
first quadrant bounded by y = x2, the y-axis, and the line y = 9 around the y-axis.
You’ve Got Problems
The washer method is used to
calculate the volume of a rota-
tional solid even if part of it is
hollow. Essential to the process
are the outer and inner radii of
rotation, which extend from the
axis of rotation, respectively, to
the far and near edges of the
region to be rotated. 
In essence, the washer method
is the disk method repeated.
First, it calculates the volume of
the solid, ignoring the hole 
, finds 
the volume of the hole itself 
, and then 
subtracts the hole’s volume from
the overall volume.
Critical Point

Part 4: The Integral
Example 2: Consider the area bounded by the graphs of y = –x2 + 2x + 1 and y = 1. What
volume is generated if this area is rotated about the x-axis?
Solution: Let’s have a look at the situation in Figure 19.4.
212
Figure 19.4
Rotating this area about
the x-axis results in some-
thing that is not com-
pletely solid—it has a hole
of radius 1. It’s basically a
math Cheerio.
Because the shaded area is not right up against the x-axis, that space separating the region
from the rotational axis also gets rotated, leaving a hole of radius 1 in the rotational solid.
The outer radius, designated in the figure as R(x), extends from the x-axis to the furthest
edge of the region, whereas the inner radius, r(x), extends to the innermost edge of the
region. Find the lengths of each radius the same way you did with the disk method; sub-
tract the top boundary equation minus the bottom boundary. Keep in mind that the bot-
tom boundary is the x-axis and has the equation y = 0:
R(x) = –x2 + 2x + 1 – 0 = –x2 + 2x +1
r(x) = 1 – 0 = 1
Finally, to find the area, plug into the washer method formula. Since these graphs inter-
sect at x = 0 and x = 2, these are the boundaries for the region and should be your limits
of integration:

Chapter 19: Applications of Integration
A brief word of warning: we’ve been rotating about the x- and y-axes exclusively. This
makes it easy to find the lengths of the radii of rotation, as the bottom boundary has been
0, and subtracting 0 is pretty easy. In Problem 2, you’ll be rotating around something
other than an axis, so be careful when calculating the radii of rotation.
213
The Shell Method
The final technique for finding rotational vol-
umes uses radii parallel to the axis of rotation,
rather than perpendicular to it. It’s easy to
remember that because shell and parallel rhyme.
The other major difference in the shell method is
the use of a representative radius rather than radii
of rotation. Instead of extending a radius from the
axis of rotation to the edge of the region, simply
extend a radius from one edge of the region to 
the other. The formula for the shell method is 
, where d(x) is the distance 
from the representative radius to the rotational axis, h(x) is the length of the radius, and a
and b are the boundaries of the area to be rotated. 
The shell method can be used to calculate the volume of a rotational solid whether or 
not it has any hollowness. Therefore, it can be used in lieu of both the disk and washer
methods.
Example 3: Rotate the area bounded by y = x3 + x, x = 2, and the x-axis around the y-axis,
and calculate the volume of the solid of revolution.
Solution: Since you are rotating about the y-axis, the washer method would require hori-
zontal radii (they are perpendicular to the vertical axis of rotation). That means everything
would have to be in terms of y, and there’s no easy way to solve y = x3 + x for x. However,
with the shell method you don’t have to do any conversions at all. Draw the region with
its representative radius—it should be a vertical segment running across the region since
the axis of rotation is also vertical (see Figure 19.5).
Problem 2: Find the volume generated by rotating the region bounded by 
and
y = x3 about the line y = –1.
You’ve Got Problems
In the shell method, you use a
representative radius, which
extends from one edge of the
region to the opposite edge,
rather than a radius of rotation,
which extends from the axis 
of rotation to an edge of the
region.

Part 4: The Integral
214
Figure 19.5
Notice that the radius is
now parallel to the rota-
tional axis.
You can say that the radius is a value of x units to the right of the origin, so d(x) = x. The
height of the radius, h(x), is found by subtracting its bottom boundary from its top bound-
ary: x3 + x – 0. Since you are using all x-values, the boundaries of the region are 0 and 2.
Plug these values into the formula for the shell method:
Keep in mind that the equation d(x) will not always be x; for instance, if you rotate the
region about the line x = –2, you’ll get Figure 19.6.
Figure 19.6
The region is the same as
Example 3, but the axis of
rotation has changed.

Chapter 19: Applications of Integration
215
The length from the origin to the radius is still x, but there is an additional distance of 2
to the rotational axis, so d(x) = x + 2.
Arc Length
At this point, you can do all kinds of crazy math calculating. Geometry told you how to
find weird areas, and calculus took that skill even further. The kinds of areas you can cal-
culate now would have boggled your mind back in your days of geometric innocence.
However, it remains a math skill that has visible and understandable applications, even to
those who don’t know the difference between calculus and a tuna sandwich. Now, let’s add
to your list of skills the ability to find lengths of curves. By the time you’re done, you’ll
even be able to prove (finally) that the circumference of a circle really is 2π.
Rectangular Equations
The term “rectangular equations” really means “plain, old, run-of-the-mill, everyday
functions.” Mathematicians use it for the obvious reason that it takes less time to say
(mathematicians are busy people). It turns out that finding the length of a curve (on an x
interval) is as easy as calculating a definite integral. In fact, the length of a continuous 
function f(x) on the interval [a,b] is equal to 
. In other words, find the 
derivative of the function, square it, add 1, and integrate the square root of the result over
the correct interval.
Example 4: Find the length of the function 
between the points (1,1) and
(16,4) on its graph.
Solution: Use the Power Rule to find the derivative of g(x) = x1/2, and you get 
. All you do now is plug into the arc length formula:
Problem 3: Calculate the volume generated by rotating the area bounded by 
and y = x3 about the x-axis using the shell method.
You’ve Got Problems

Part 4: The Integral
The integration problem that results is not simple at all. For our purposes, it is enough to
know and apply the formula, not to struggle through the integral itself. You’ll find that
many (if not most) arc-length integrals will end up complicated and require somewhat
advanced methods to integrate. We will, however, satisfy ourselves with a computer- or
calculator-assisted solution—they have no problem with complex definite integrals. The
final answer is approximately 15.3397.
Don’t feel like you’re cheating by using a calculating tool rather than solving this problem
by hand. You’d have to know just about every integration technique there is to find the
arc lengths of even very simple functions.
216
Parametric Equations
I haven’t mentioned parametric equations for a while—they’ve been lurking in the shad-
ows, but now they get to come out and play. There are numerous similarities in the for-
mula for parametric equation arc length and rectangular arc length. Both are definite
integrals, both involve a sum of two terms beneath a radical, and both involve finding the
derivative of the original equation. 
The arc length of a curve defined parametrically is found with the definite integral 
, where a and b are limiting values of the parameter this time—not x
boundaries. In other words, find the derivatives of the x and y equations, square them
both, add them together, and square root and integrate the whole mess.
Example 5: The parametric representation of a circle
with radius 1 (centered at the origin) is x = cos θ, 
y = sin θ. Prove that the circumference of a circle really
is 2π by calculating the arc length of the parametric
curve on 0 ≤θ ≤2π.
Solution: Start by finding the derivatives of the x and y
equations with respect to θ: 
Problem 4: Which function is longer on the interval [0,2]: f(x) = x2 or g(x) = x3?
You’ve Got Problems
Don’t get confused because
the parameter in Exam-ple 5
is not t. The formula for arc
length with a parameter of θ is
exactly the same; it just has θ‘s
instead of t’s in the formula.

Now plug those values into the parametric arc-length formula and simplify using the
Mama theorem (review Chapter 4 if you don’t know what the heck I mean by that):

Differential Equations,
Sequences, Series, and
Salutations
If differentiation and integration are, respectively, the mother and father figures
of calculus, then sequences and series are the bratty kids. If you look closely, you
can see that they’re related. However, once you’re knee-deep in sequences and
series, you’ll wonder how they can be related to their parents at all, and wonder
if they were outright adopted. The closest you’ve come to dealing with infinite
series and sequences is improper integration, but even that is a stretch.
Differential equations, on the other hand, are very obviously related to what
you’ve been doing all along. In fact, solving them will begin as a simple extension
of integration, something at which you are already approaching expert status.
This process (called separation of variables) will not always work, however, so
you’ll also learn ways of dealing with differential equations that defy separation.
Finally, it’s time to put away your notes, stick your book bag under your chair,
and take the final exam to find out how much you’ve learned. Eyes on your own

Differential Equations
In This Chapter
◆What are differential equations?
◆Separation of variables
◆Initial conditions and differential equations
◆Modeling exponential growth and decay
Most calculus courses contain some discussion of differential equations, but
that discussion is extremely limited to the basics. Most math majors will tell
you that they had to suffer through an entire course on solving differential
equations at some point in their math career. This is because differential equa-
tions are extremely useful in modeling real-life scenarios, and are used exten-
sively by scientists.
A differential equation is nothing more than an equation containing a deriva-
tive. In fact, you have created more than your fair share of differential equa-
tions simply by finding derivatives of functions in the first half of the book. In
this chapter, you’ll begin with the differential equation (i.e., the derivative)
and work your way backwards to the original equation. Sound familiar?
Basically you’re just going to be applying integration methods, as you have for
numerous chapters now.
Chapter

Part 5: Differential Equations, Sequences, Series, and Salutations
However, solving differential equations is not the same thing as integrating. There are lots
of complicated differential equations (that we won’t be exploring). Luckily, the most popu-
lar differential equation application in beginning calculus (exponential growth and decay)
requires you to use a very simple solution technique called separation of variables. Let’s
start there.
Separation of Variables
If a differential equation is nothing more than an equation containing a derivative, and solv-
ing a differential equation basically means finding the antiderivative, then what’s so hard
about solving differential equations, and why does it 
get treated as a separate topic? The reason is that differ-
ential equations are usually not as straightforward 
as this one:
Clearly, the solution to this differential equation is 
y = 3sin x + x + C. All you have to do is integrate both
sides of the equation. Most differential equations are all
twisted up and knotted together with variables all over
the place, like this:
It looks like someone chewed up a whole bunch of equations and spat them out in random
order (which is both puzzling and unappetizing). In order to solve this differential equa-
tion, you’ll have to separate the variables. In other words, move all the y’s to the left side of
the equation and all the x’s to the right side. Once that is done, you’ll be able to integrate
both sides of the equation separately. This process, appropriately called separation of vari-
ables, solves any basic differential equations you’ll encounter.
Example 1: Find the solution to the differential equation               , where k is a constant.
Solution: You need to move y to the left side of the equation and move dx to the right side.
Since k is a constant, it’s not clear whether or not you should move it. As a rule of thumb,
move all constants to the right side of the equation. Your goal is to solve for y, so you don’t
want any non-y things on the left side of the equation. Start by moving the y; so divide
both sides of the equation by y to get:
 
222
Differential equations are just
equations that contain a deriva-
tive. Most basic differential equa-
tions can be solved using a
method called separation of
variables, in which you move dif-
ferent variables to opposite sides
of the equation so that you can
integrate both sides of the equa-
tion separately.

Chapter 20: Differential Equations
Now shoot that dx to the right side of the equation by multiplying both sides by dx:
At this point, you can integrate both sides of the equation. Since k is a constant, its anti-
derivative is kx, just like the antiderivative of 5 would be 5x:
You’re not quite done yet. Your final answer to a differential equation should be solved for
y. To cancel out the natural log function and accomplish this, you have to use its inverse
function, ex, like this: eln|y| = ekx+C. (Drop the absolute value signs around the y now—they
were only needed since the domain of the natural log function is only positive numbers.
As the natural log disappears, let the absolute value bars go with it.)
In other words, rewrite the equation so that both sides are the powers of the natural expo-
nential function. This gives you y = ekx+C, since ex and ln x are inverse functions, and as
such, eln x = ln(ex) = x. You could stop here, but go just one step further. Remember the
basic exponential rule that said xa ⋅xb = xa+b? The above equation looks like xa+b, so you
can break it up into xa ⋅xb:
y = ekx ⋅eC
Almost done. I promise. Since you have no idea what value C has, you have no idea what
eC will be. You know it’ll be some number, but you have no idea what number that is. As
you’ve done in the past, rewrite eC as C, signifying that even though it’s not the same value
as the original C, it’s still some number you don’t know: y = Cekx.
That’s the solution to the differential equation. It took you a while to get here, but this is
a very important equation, and you’ll need it in a few pages.
 
 
223
Types of Solutions
Just like integrals, solutions to differential equations come in two forms: with and with-
out a “+ C” term. Definite integrals had no such term, because their final answers were 
Problem 1: Find the solution to the differential equation 
.
You’ve Got Problems

Part 5: Differential Equations, Sequences, Series, and Salutations
numbers rather than equations. Whereas the solution to a differential equation will always
come in delicious, equation form (with candy-shaped marshmallows); in some cases, you’ll
be able to determine exactly what the value of C should be, so you can provide a more
specific answer.
Family of Solutions
If you are only given a differential equation, you can only get a general solution. Ex-
ample 1 and Problem 1 are two such instances. Remember, integration cannot usually 
tell you exactly what a function’s antiderivative is, since any functions differing only by a
constant will have the same derivative.
The solution to a differential equation containing a “+ C” term is actually a family of so-
lutions, since it technically represents an infinite number of possible solutions to the 
differential equation. Think about the differential equa-
tion 
. If you use the separation of variables 
technique, you get a solution of y = x2 + 7x + C. You can
plug in any real number value for C and the result is a
solution to the original differential equation. For 
example, y = x2 + 7x + 5, 
, and 
y = x2 + 7x + 4π all have a derivative of 2x + 7. These
three (plus an infinite number of other equations) make
up the family of solutions.
Knowing a family of solutions is sometimes not enough.
Differential equations are often used as mathematical
models to illustrate real-life examples and situations. In
such cases, you’ll need to be able to find specific solu-
tions to differential equations, but to do so you’ll need a
little more information up front.
Specific Solutions
In order to determine exactly what C equals for any differential equation solution, you’ll
need to know at least one coordinate pair of the differential equation’s antiderivative.
With that information, you can plug in the (x,y) pair and solve for C. To explain what I
mean, I have thrown together a little example for those game show fans out there.
I don’t know what it is that makes people (by which I mean my wife and me) so excited to
watch other people agonize about winning dishwashers by throwing comically oversized
dice, but it doesn’t stop us from watching game shows. However, the sudden trend in
these programs isn’t playing silly games for prizes anymore; instead, they subject the con-
testants to peril in order to win vast sums of money.
224
Any mathematical solution contain-
ing “+ C” is called a family of
solutions, since it doesn’t give one
specific answer. It compactly
describes an infinite number of
solutions, each differing only by a
constant. The members of a family
of solutions have the same shape,
differing only in their vertical posi-
tion along the y-axis. In order to
reach a specific solution, the prob-
lem will have to provide addi-
tional information.

Chapter 20: Differential Equations
Example 2: A new television game show this fall on FOX TV is making quite a stir.
Terminal Velocity will suspend contestants by their ankles on a bungee cord. Producers are
still working out the details, but one of the show’s features will be dropping the participants
from the ceiling and allowing them to repeatedly lurch their way to the studio floor as the
length of the bungee is slowly increased. Plus, the audience will throw things at them (like
small rocks or maybe piranhas if ratings begin to sag). Suppose that the velocity of a con-
testant (in ft/sec), for the first 10 seconds of her fall, is given by 
. If the 
initial position of the doomed individual is 115 feet off the ground, find her position
equation.
Solution: You are given a differential equation representing velocity. The solution to the
differential equation will then be the antiderivative of velocity, position. The problem also
tells you that the initial position is 115 feet high. This means that the contestant’s position
at time equals 0 is 115, so s(0) = 115. You’ll use that in a second to find C, but first things
first; you need to apply separation of variables to solve the differential equation:
There you have it—the position equation. Remember that you should get 115 if you plug
in 0 for t; make that substitution, and you can find C easily:
115 = 40cos(2 ⋅0) – 4 ⋅0 + C
115 = 40cos(0) + C
115 = 40 ⋅1 + C
75 = C
Therefore, the exact position equation is s(t) = 40cos(2t) – 4t + 75.
225
Exponential Growth and Decay
Most people have an intuitive understanding of what it means to exhibit exponential
growth. Basically, it means that things are increasing in an out-of-control way, like a virus
in a horror movie. One infected person spreads the illness to another person, then those
Problem 2: A particle moves horizontally back and forth along the x-axis according to
some position equation s(t); the particle’s acceleration (in ft/sec2) is described accu-
rately by the equation a(t) = 2t + 5 – sin t. If you know that the particle has an initial
velocity of –2 ft/sec and an initial position of 5 feet, find v(t) (the particle’s velocity) and
s(t) (the particle’s position).

two each spread it to another. Two infected people become four, four become eight, eight
become sixteen, until it’s an epidemic and Jackie Chan has to come in to save the day, pos-
sibly with karate kicks.
Truth be told, actual exponential growth doesn’t happen a
lot. An exponential growth model assumes that there is an
infinite amount of resources from which to draw. In our
epidemic example, the rate of increase of the illness can-
not go on uninhibited, because eventually, everyone will
already be sick. To get around such restrictions, many
problems involving exponential growth and decay deal
with exciting things like bacterial growth. Bacteria are
small, so it takes them much longer to conquer the world
(thanks in no small part, once again, to Jackie Chan).
Notice that in Figure 20.1, the logistic growth curve
changes concavity (from concave up to concave down)
about midway through the interval. This change in con-
cavity indicates the point at which growth begins 
to slow.
226
Figure 20.1
Two kinds of growth.
Neither explains that
weird mole on your neck.
A more realistic example of growth and decay is logistic growth. In this model, growth
begins quickly (it basically looks exponential at first) and then slows as it reaches some
limiting factor (as our virus could only spread to so many people before everyone was
already dead—isn’t that a pleasant thought?). Although it is not beyond our abilities do
examine logistic growth, it is by far more complicated to understand and model, so we’ll
stick with exponential growth.
Mathematically, exponential growth is pretty neat. We say that a population exhibits expo-
nential growth if its rate of change is directly proportional to the population itself. Thus, 
a population P grows (or decays) exponentially if 
and P are in proportion to each 
Exponential growth occurs when
the rate of change of a popula-
tion is proportional to the popula-
tion itself. In other words, the
bigger the population, the larger
it grows. (With exponential decay,
the smaller the population, the
more slowly it decreases.) Logistic
growth begins almost exponen-
tially but eventually grows more
slowly and stops, as the popula-
tion reaches some limiting value.

Chapter 20: Differential Equations
other. So how fast something grows or decays is based on how much of it there is.
Without getting into a lot of detail (too late for that, isn’t it?), we can say that these two
things are in proportion when they’re equal to each other, if one of the terms is multiplied
by a constant (for instance, one thing is two times or five times as big as the other).
Recognize that? It’s Example 1! Since you already solved this differential equation earlier
in the chapter, you know that a population showing exponential growth has equation:
y = Nekt
(I know I used “C” as the constant before, but I like having the “N” there better, because
when you read the formula, it looks like the word “naked,” and I am immature enough to
think that’s pretty funny.) In this formula, N represents the beginning or initial popula-
tion, k is a constant of proportionality, and t
stands for time. (The e is just Euler’s number,
which you’ve undoubtedly seen lurking about
in your precalculus work—it’s not a vari-
able. Most calculators, even scientific ones,
have a button for Euler’s number, so you
don’t have to memorize it.) The y represents
the total population after time t has passed.
Your first step in the majority of exponential
growth and decay problems is to find k, because
you will almost never be able to determine
what k is based on the problem. Don’t even
try to guess k—it’s rarely, if ever, obvious.
For example, if your population increased in
this sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc., you may
be tempted to think that k = 2 since the
population constantly doubles, but instead, 
k ≈0.693147, which is actually in 1n 2.
Example 3: Even after that great movie Pay It
Forward came out, the movement promoted by the
film never really caught on. Its premise was that
you should do a big favor for three different peo-
ple, something they couldn’t accomplish on their
own. In turn, they would provide favors for three
other people, and so on. Unfortunately, a new
movement called Punch It Forward is catching on
227
You use the same formula for
both exponential growth and
decay. The only difference in
the two is that k will turn out to
be negative in decay problems
and positive in growth problems.
Critical Point
It’s easy to see why N repre-
sents the initial population. In
Example 3, you know that ini-
tially (i.e., when t = 0), there is
a population of 19. Plugging 
into y = Nekt, that gives you 
19 = Nek ⋅0. The exponent for e
is 0, and anything to the 0 power
is 1. Therefore, the equation
becomes 19 = N ⋅1. Instead of
doing this in each problem, you
can automatically plug the initial
value into N.
Critical Point

Part 5: Differential Equations, Sequences, Series, and Salutations
instead. It’s the same premise, but with punching instead of favors. On the first day of
Punch It Forward, 19 people are involved in the movement. After 10 days, 193 people are
involved. How many people will be involved 30 days after Punch It Forward begins,
assuming that exponential growth is exhibited during that time?
Solution: Use the exponential growth and decay formula y = Nekt. N represents the initial
population (19). You know that after 10 days have elapsed, the new population is 193.
Therefore, when t = 10, y = 193. Plug all these values in and solve for k:
Therefore, the exponential growth model is y = 19e0.231825t. To find out the population
after the first 30 days, plug in 30 for t:
Approximately 19,914 people have been inducted (and possibly indicted) into the Punch It
Forward society after only one month. It’s a brave new world, my friend.
228
Problem 3: Those big members-only warehouse superstores always sell things in such
gigantic quantities. It’s unclear what possessed you to buy 15,000 grams of Radon-
222 radioactive waste. Perhaps you thought it would complement your 50-gallon barrel
of mustard. In any case, it was a bigger mistake to drop it in the parking lot. All
radioactive waste has a defined half-life—the period of time it takes for half of the mass
of the substance to decay away. The half-life of Radon-222 is 3.82 days. (In other
words, 3.82 days after the waste pours out on the asphalt, 7,500 grams remain, and
only 3,750 grams 3.82 days after that.) Approximately how long will it take for the
15,000 grams of Radon-222 to decay to a harmless 50 grams?

◆Using Euler’s Method to solve differential equations
Our brief encounter with differential equations is almost at an end. Like ships
passing in the night, we will soon go our separate ways, and all you’ll have left
are the memories. Before you get too nostalgic, though, we have to discuss
some slightly more complex differential equation topics.
We’ll start with linear approximation, which we actually could have discussed
in Chapter 9, because it is basically an in-depth look at tangent lines. How-
ever, it is a precursor to a more complex topic called Euler’s Method, which is
an arithmetic-heavy way to solve differential equations if you can’t use separa-
tion of variables. It’s a good approximation technique to have handy, since
there are about 10 gijillion other ways to solve differential equations that we
don’t know the first thing about at this level of mathematical maturity.

Before we call it quits, we’ll also spend some quality time with slope fields. They are
exactly what they sound like—a field of teeny little slopes, planted like cabbages. By
examining those cabbages, we can tell a lot about the solution to a differential equation.
All in all, this chapter focuses on ways to broaden our understanding of differential equa-
tions without having to learn a whole lot more mathematics in the process. You have to
love that.
Linear Approximation
We have been finding derivatives like mad throughout this entire book. Even though the
derivative is the slope of the tangent line, it took us a while to appreciate why that could
be even a remotely useful thing to know. In time, we learned that derivatives describe
rates of change and can be used to optimize functions, among other things.
Let’s add something new to the list about how mind-numbingly useful derivatives are.
Take a look at the graph of a function f(x) and its tangent line at the point (c, f(c)) in
Figure 21.1.
232
Figure 21.1
The graphs are very close
to one another at x = c,
but the farther away from
the point of tangency, the
farther apart they get. The
line, for example, would
not give you a good
approximate value for f(0).
The y-intercept of the line
is negative, but the func-
tion is positive when x = 0.
Notice how the graph of f and the tangent line graph get very close to each other around
x = c. If you were to plug a value of x very close to c into both functions, you’d get the
same output. 
Because the equation of a tangent line to a function has values that usually come very
close to the function around the point of tangency, that tangent equation is a good linear
approximation for the function. No matter how simple a function may be to evaluate, not
many functions are simpler than the equation of a line. Furthermore, there are some 

Chapter 21: Visualizing Differential Equations
functions that are way too hard to evaluate
without a calculator, and linear approximations
are very handy to approximate such functions.
Example 1: Estimate the value of ln(1.1) using 
the linear approximation to f(x) = ln x centered at
x = 1.
Solution: The problem asks you to center your
linear approximation at x = 1; this means that you
should find the equation of the tangent line to f(x) at that x-value. It’s easy to build the
equation of a tangent line—you did it way back in Chapter 10. All you need is the slope of
the tangent line, which is 
, and the point of tangency, which is f(1) = ln 1 = 0.
With this information, use the point-slope equation to build the tangent line:
233
Now plug in x = 1.1 into the linear equation; you’ll get y = 1.1 – 1 = 0.1. The actual value
of ln(1.1) is .09531, so your estimate is pretty close.
A linear approximation is the
equation of a tangent line to a
function used to approximate the
function’s values lying close to the
point of tangency.
Remember: Only use a linear approximation for x-values close to the x at which the
approximation was centered. Notice that the approximation in Example 1 gives an 
awful approximation of lnx when 
: –0.87. The actual value of 
is –2.079. 
That’s rather inaccurate, even though 
is less than one unit away from the center of the 
approximation!

Slope Fields
Even if you can’t solve a differential equation, you can still get a good idea of what the
solution’s graph looks like. You just learned that a graph’s tangent line looks a lot like the
graph right around the point of tangency. Well, if you draw little tiny pieces of tangent
line all over the coordinate plane, those pieces will show the shape of the solution graph.
It’s similar to using metallic shavings to determine where magnetic fields lie, or sprinkling 
fingerprint powder on a table’s surface to highlight the shape of the print.
Drawing a slope field is a very simple process for basic differential equations, but it can get
a bit repetitive. All you have to do is plug points from the coordinate plane into the differ-
ential equation. Remember, the differential equation represents the slope of the solution
graph, as it is the first derivative. You will then draw a
small line segment centered at that point with the slope
you calculated.
Let’s start with a very basic example: 
. You know 
that the solution to this differential equation is y = x2 + C,
a family of parabolas with their vertices on the y-axis.
Let’s draw the slope field for 
. First, let’s identify 
the fertile field where our slopes will grow and flourish
(see Figure 21.2).
Figure 21.2
Each of the points indi-
cated has coordinates that
are integers; this makes
the substitution a little
quicker and easier.

A slope field is a tool to help visu-
alize the solution to a differential
equation. It is made up of a col-
lection of line segments centered
at points whose slopes are the val-
ues of the differential equation
evaluated at those points.

Chapter 21: Visualizing Differential Equations
At every dot on that field, you are going to draw a tiny little segment. Let’s start at the ori-
gin. If you plug (0,0) into 
, you get 
, so the slope of the tangent line 
there will be 0 (i.e., the line is horizontal). Therefore, draw a small horizontal segment
centered at the origin. The substitution was pretty easy—you didn’t even have to plug the
y-value in, because there is no y in the differential equation. 
Now, you should do the same thing for
every other point in Figure 21.2. Let’s do
one more together to make sure you’ve got
the hang of this. For fun, I’ll pick the point
(1,2)—doesn’t that sound fun? Plugging it
into the differential equation gives you
. Therefore, the line segment 
centered at (1,2) will have a slope of 2.
Once you’ve plugged all those points into the dif-
ferential equation, you should end up with some-
thing like Figure 21.3.
235
Figure 21.3
A slope field with just a
hint of parabola.
As a rule of thumb, a slope of
1 means a segment with a 45-
degree angle. Greater slopes
will be steeper and smaller
slopes will be shallower. Negative
slopes will fall from left to right,
whereas positive slopes rise from
left to right.
Critical Point
A slope field will always outline a family of solutions. If you are given a point on
the graph of the solution, place your pencil there and follow the paths of the slope
segments to get an approximate graph of the specific solution. It’s not an exact method
of obtaining a graph by any means. Soon, however, you’ll learn Euler’s Method, and
that’ll help you find more exact solutions to unsolvable differential equations.
Kelley’s Cautions

Part 5: Differential Equations, Sequences, Series, and Salutations
Can you see the shape hiding among all the little twigs? It’s not perfect, but these little
segments do a pretty good job of outlining the shape of a parabola whose vertex is on the
y-axis. The slope field traces the shape of its solution curve. If you use a computer to 
draw the slope field, the shape is even clearer. (Computers don’t tire as easily as I do 
when plugging in points; they don’t even mind fractions.) For example, Figure 21.4 is a
computer-generated slope field for 
with a specific solution shown, so you can see 
how well the slope field traces the solution.
236
Figure 21.4
Although one parabola is
drawn as a possible solu-
tion, it’s easy to see that
there are a lot of possible
parabolas hiding in the
woodwork. The solution
graph assumes that the
point (0,–1) is a point on
the solution.

Again, this is a very detailed slope field; the computer
calculated slopes at many fractional coordinates as
well as integer coordinates. If you know the solution
to the differential equation contains the point (0,–1),
you get the specific solution, represented by the dark-
ened graph.
Slope fields are most useful when you cannot solve
the given differential equation by separation of vari-
ables but still want to see what the graph of the solution looks like. There are so many
differential equations out there that we can’t solve at this level of our journey toward
mathematical enlightenment, it’s good to enlist as many allies as we can.

program called Graphmatica
that draws slope fields on 
your computer at www.

Euler’s Method
To understand what Euler’s Method really ac-
complishes in the land of differential equations,
we need to talk about navigating through the
woods. I am not a huge fan of the outdoors, to be
perfectly honest. I’m glad to be inside with the air
conditioning on, away from flies, ticks, and those
ugly little spiders that burrow under your skin and
lay eggs in your brain. You may say those kinds of
spiders don’t exist and you’re probably right, but
there’s nothing wrong with being too careful.
This was not the case when I was younger. I always enjoyed tromping around outside and
coming in as dirty as possible, covered in mud, sand, grass stains, and mashed bugs. In
particular, I enjoyed exploring the woods with my friends. Most of the time, we’d be in
areas either my friends or I knew extremely well. We even had crude maps of the woods
drawn out, not that we ever actually had to resort to them. In new or unfamiliar woods,
however, we’d rely on a compass to direct us to a road we knew: “Okay, if we get lost we’ll
go west and meet at the rotten tree trunk John lost his shoe in last year; watch out for
those brain-egg spiders along the way.”
When you solve a differential equation using separation of variables, you’re given a map
to all the correct solutions for that differential equation. In fact, the correct path to follow
is the graph of the equation’s solution. Back to our simple example from earlier: if the
solution to the differential equation 
contains the point (3,6), you can easily find 
the exact solution using separation of variables. The antiderivative will be y = x2 + C, and
you can plug in the coordinate pair to find C:
Therefore, the exact solution to the differential equation is y = x2 –3. Now that you have
this solution, it maps your way to other values on the solution graph. For example, it’s
Problem 2: Draw the slope field for 
and sketch the specific solution 
to the differential equation that contains the point (0,1).
You’ve Got Problems
Euler’s Method is a technique
used to approximate values on
the solution graph to a differen-
tial equation when you can’t
actually find the specific solution
to the differential equation via
separation of variables. By the
way, Euler is pronounced OIL-er,
not YOU-ler.

Part 5: Differential Equations, Sequences, Series, and Salutations
very easy to determine what the value of y(4) is (i.e., the solution graph’s output when you
input x = 4):
The solution graph “map” makes it easy to find the correct y-value corresponding to any
x-value. But—and this is a big but—what if you can’t solve the differential equation by
separation of variables? Instead of a map, you’ll use the compass of Euler’s Method.
You’ll still be given a point on the solution curve in these problems, but you won’t be able
to use it to find C. Instead, you’ll use it as your reference point (“If you get lost, go west
and meet at the shoe-devouring tree trunk”). From there, you’ll take a compass reading
(“We should go north—that big tree that looks like Scooby Doo is north from here”).
When you have gone a fixed distance, you’ll take another compass reading (“Okay, we’re
at the tree; now we should go northeast to that log with the frog on it”). After every small
journey (as you reach each landmark), you’ll take a compass reading and make sure that
your course is true, and that you’re heading in the right direction. After all, you are navi-
gating in unknown lands without a map, with dangerous spiders everywhere. Better keep
checking your compass.
Remember, a function and its tangent line have nearly equal values near the point of tan-
gency. This is essential to Euler’s Method. Taking compass readings in the woods is analo-
gous to finding the correct derivative for the given function. We’ll then step carefully along
this slope for a fixed amount of time. If we go too far, the values of the slope will become
too different from the values of the function (whose map we don’t have). So we’ll make
another derivative check and start moving down this new direction. Remember, we don’t
know where the path is, but by using derivatives, we’re staying as close to it as possible.
Before we can actually perform Euler’s Method, we need to possess one prerequisite skill.
Let’s say you are at the point (0,3) and want to walk along a certain line that passes
through that point. If that line has slope 
, then walking up two units and to the 
right five units—arriving at the point (5,5)—ensures that you stay on the line. However,
what if you only want to go 
of a unit up? How many units would you go right to make 
sure you were still on the line?
Example 2: Line l passes through (0,3) and has slope 
. Without finding the equation
of line l, find the correct y in the coordinate pair 
if that point is also on line l.
238

Chapter 21: Visualizing Differential Equations
Solution: The point (
,y) is exactly 
of a 
unit to the right of the original point (0,3), so
you can say that the change in x is 
from the
first to the second point. Mathematically, this
is written 
. All you have to do is find 
the corresponding Δy to determine how far you
should go vertically from the original y-value of 3.
Remem-ber that according to the slope equation
you learned in your mathematical infancy, slope is
equal to the change in y divided by the change in x:
. Use this equation to find the correct Δy:
According to this, you need to go up 
of a unit from the original y-value of 3 to stay on 
the line. Since 
, the point 
is guaranteed to be on the line 
through (0,3) whose slope is .
239
Now it’s time to actually use Euler’s Method. Euler’s problems give you a differential
equation, a starting point, and a value that needs estimating on the solution curve. You’ll
be told how many steps of what width to use, and you’ll take steps of that width using the
same method you did in Example 2.
Example 3: Use Euler’s Method with three steps of width 
to approximate y(3) if 
and the point (2,1) appears on the solution graph.
In Example 2, you’re learning
how to use a compass reading 
to walk a short 
distance 
and yet stay 
on the correct path.

Problem 3: If you begin at point (–1,4) and proceed to the right a distance of 
along a line with a slope of 
, at what point do you arrive?

Part 5: Differential Equations, Sequences, Series, and Salutations
Solution: It should be clear why the width of the steps is 
—you’re stepping from 
x = 2 to x = 3 in three steps. You’ll repeat the same process three times, one for each step.
Step One: From x = 2 to 
The tangent slope at the point (2,1) is 
Use this slope to calculate the correct value of Δy:
This tells you to go up one unit from y = 1 while step-
ping right

Step Two: From

time, the tangent slope is

240
The more steps you take
(i.e., the smaller the width of
each step), the more accurate
your final approximation will be.
Even with large steps, however,
Euler’s Method gets messy quickly;
the ugly fractions compound, and
it’s easy to make an arithmetic
mistake. It’s best to check your
work with a calculator.

◆Sequences: more than lists of numbers
◆Can sequences have limits?
◆The difference between sequences and series
◆Understanding very simple series
As they used to say in Monty Python’s Flying Circus, “Now, for something com-
pletely different.” It’s time for sequences and series. I’ve always thought it
strange that a completely unrelated calculus topic be thrown in at the end of a
basic calculus course, but so it has been, and so it shall be. Perhaps it is over-
stating the matter to say that a brief study in these topics is completely unre-
lated. You’ll see some limits (in fact, you’ll see limits at infinity, which are
always fun), and a smidgen of integration thrown in as well. However, these
final chapters are sure to leave a different taste in your mouth than those pre-
ceding them.
Sequences and series are often the least understood and most quickly forgot-
ten topics for calculus students. This happens mainly because they fall at the
end of the course, when students tire of learning new material, and (sad but
true) when teachers are tired of presenting it. 
That’s not to say that this chapter is difficult to understand, tricky, or uninter-
esting. In fact, some of the things you’ll learn are downright fascinating, but
Chapter

Part 5: Differential Equations, Sequences, Series, and Salutations
it’s up to you to stay the course and keep focused. Many a great calculus student has fallen
prey to indifference this late in the game. Don’t let it happen to you!
What Is a Sequence?
When I was in elementary school, I used to love those little pattern puzzles. You know the
ones I’m talking about: “Find the next number in the following sequence: 1, 3, 5, 7, ….”
After some careful consideration, you would see that the next number in the pattern
would be 36 (just kidding—it’s 9). Unbeknownst to you, you were exploring a very basic
mathematical sequence.
A sequence is a list or collection of numbers that is gen-
erated by some defining rule. It can be written as a list,
like the simple sequence above, or in braced notation
using the variable n. For example, the sequence of odd
integers is generated by the sequence {2n–1}. See how
the sequence develops as you plug in integer values for
n, beginning with 1:
(2(1) –1), (2(2) –1), (2(3) –1), (2(4) –1), (2(5) –1), …
= 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, …
How did I know to use that pattern to generate the odd integers? Well, two times any-
thing must always result in an even number, and if you subtract 1 from an even number
the result is always odd. Sometimes the trickiest thing about sequences is trying to figure
out what the defining rule is, given only a list of the terms in the sequence. All it takes is a
little practice (which you’ll get in a few moments) and a good instinct for patterns.
244
Sequence Convergence
Your primary goal when dealing with sequences will be to determine whether or not they
converge. If a sequence is convergent, the terms in it will approach, but never reach, some
A sequence is a list of numbers
generated by some mathematical
rule typically expressed in terms
of n. In order to construct the
sequence, you plug consecutive
integer values into n.
You may wonder, “Can I start by plugging in 0 (or any other number besides 1) to
get the sequence if it’s written in braced notation?” The answer is: Don’t sweat the
small stuff. When we discuss sequences, we’re usually worried about how the one 
jillionth element behaves, not the first two or three. The main focus is the pattern, not
where the pattern starts. This is not so with series, however—but more on that at the
right time.

Chapter 22: Sequences and Series
limiting real number value. The key word there is “limiting,” because you’ll use a 
limit at infinity to determine whether or not a sequence converges. This makes 
the process very easy, because you’ve already dealt with limits at infinity out the 
wazoo, so there are no new concepts to learn
just yet.
Mathematically, we say that the sequence {an}
converges if 
exists. This makes a lot of 
sense. In essence, you are looking to see how the
sequence acts as n gets very large, which means
that you’re inspecting the behavior of the se-
quence far, far down its list of members. If the
rule defining the sequence has a limit, then it only
makes sense that the sequence created by that rule
would also be bounded.
Example 1: Is the sequence 
…
convergent or divergent?
Solution: First, you need to come up with a general rule that defines this sequence. The
first term (n = 1) is , while the second term (n = 2) is . Notice that the numerator 
is one less than n and the denominator for each term is n2. The same pattern holds true 
for the other terms, so the sequence is 
. To see if this converges, you examine 
. Remember how to do limits at infinity? You can either use L’Hôpital’s Rule or 
compare degrees of the numerator and denominator. Either way, you get a limit of 0. Since
the limit exists (i.e., the sequence does not increase without bound), the sequence converges.
245
What Is a Series?
A mathematical series is very similar to a sequence. However, instead of simply listing the
numbers in sequence, you add them together. Series are also a little pickier about where
you start and end. To keep from getting confused between sequences and series, I use the
World Series as a mnemonic device. How do you get the score of each game of the World
Series (or any baseball game, for that matter)? You add the scores together for each indi-
vidual inning. Thus, series are based on sums, whereas sequences are not.
A convergent sequence has ele-
ments that approach, but never
reach, some limiting value. If
exists, then the se-
quence {an} converges. By the
way, by writing {an} you mean
any generic sequence, just like
f(x) indicates any generic func-
tion. If the sequence does not
converge, it is called divergent.

Let’s take a look at the simple series 
. 
Don’t get frazzled by the sigma notation (that’s what you
call that Greek letter out front, for those of you who
weren’t in fraternities and sororities in college). Those
boundaries work a lot like integration boundaries. Start by
plugging the bottom bound (0) in for n and then plug in
consecutive integers until you reach the top bound (4),
which will be your last term. Remember, this is a series, so
you have to add all of the results together:
Much of the time in calculus, we don’t care about series like 
, because they are 
finite (they don’t contain an infinite number of terms). Finite series are all well and good,
but they are sort of like scuba diving in a kiddy pool. If you want to see the really exotic
fish and big octopi that drag men screaming to their watery graves, we need to examine
infinite series.
Your primary concern with infinite series will be to determine if they converge or diverge,
just like sequences. That is to say, if you were to add all the terms in the infinite sequence,
would you get an actual answer? It seems bizarre that you can add an infinite number of
things together and get, say, 
, but it happens. Like I 
told you, we’re swimming with the weird and danger-
ous fish now.
Before we slap on the swim fins and the snorkel, we
need to discuss one last thing: the nth term divergence
test. In our bizarre (and strangely persistent) scuba diver
metaphor, this test is our speargun. If any infinite series
fails this test, it is automatically divergent, and we need
not spend one more second on the problem. So the nth
term divergence test should be the first thing you apply
to any infinite series you see, in the hopes of spearing
that problem right in the gut. Once you prove a series
divergent, there’s nothing else to do other than watch it
spiral to the sea floor, on the lookout for more fero-
cious predators in the water around you.
246
A series is the sum of the terms of
a sequence. Series are typically
written in sigma notation, which
indicates what n-values create the
first and last terms of the series. 
For the rest of this chapter, and
all of the next chapter, we’re
going to be examining infinite
series and trying to determine
whether or not they converge. In
some cases, we’ll be able to find
the actual sum of the infinite
series, but in most, we’ll content
ourselves with the knowledge that
the series does converge, even if
we don’t know what the sum is.

247
Think about what this means. If you are adding an infinitely long list of numbers
together, there’s no way you can get a finite sum unless you’re eventually adding 0 (or
something close to it) infinitely. For example, if 
, then you’re eventually adding 
… forever and ever, and that sum will get infinitely large, half a unit at a 
time, for all of eternity, causing the series to diverge.
Basic Infinite Series
Let me return to my absurd but entertaining metaphor of working with series as scuba
diving for a moment. In Chapter 23, you will be plunged into the cold depths of the sea,
surrounded by aquatic life of all kinds, and quite possibly solve a very complex crime by
noticing sand patterns. (The last of the three events may only happen to you if you are the
Scooby Doo gang, Nancy Drew, or one of the Hardy Boys.) Before you can hope to sur-
vive in such an unforgiving seascape, you need to log some time in a fishing pond, sur-
rounded by guppies, minnows, and recently deceased teamsters. The series that follow are
the guppies of the infinite series world. Let’s tangle with them before we bring on the
man-eaters.
Problem 2: Does the series 
converge or diverge?
You’ve Got Problems
You can never use the nth term divergence test to prove that a series converges.
It can only prove divergence. Consider the series 
(called the “harmonic 
series”). If you apply the nth term divergence test, you’ll see that 
. You cannot
then conclude that the series converges; in fact, the series diverges, in spite of the fact 
that the sequence 
converges. In this case, the nth term divergence test tells you 
absolutely nothing.

Part 5: Differential Equations, Sequences, Series, and Salutations
Geometric Series
Whether in sigma form or expanded as a sum, geometric series are very easy to spot. All of
the terms will contain a common factor, and once it’s factored out, the result will be a
number raised to consecutive powers. That sounds like a mouthful, but it’s 
very simple in practice. All geometric series have the form 
, where a is that 
constant every term has in common and r is the ratio, the number that is raised to consec-
utive powers to generate the series.
248
A geometric series will converge if 
; it will 
diverge if 
. If the series converges, you can even 
find the sum of the series by plugging into the formula 
. Because determining convergence is as easy as 
looking at the r term, these series couldn’t be easier.
They’re only a little tricky when they are written as a
sum rather than in sigma notation, and are only margin-
ally trickier then.
Example 2: Determine whether or not the geometric series 
con-
verges. If so, give the sum of the series.
Solution: The problem very kindly tells you there’s a geometric series lurking there. 
The first term, then, is the a term, and if you factor it out of everything, you’ll get
. Clearly, the ratio in the series is 
, because the terms in the 
expansion are consecutive powers of that fraction—
, etc.
A geometric series has the form 
, where a and r are constants. When the series 
is expanded, every term will contain a, and consecutive terms will possess consecutive
powers of r, which is called the ratio. Notice that geometric series begin with n = 0. This
has the net effect of making the first term a when the series is written as a sum:

P-Series
If a series has the form 
, where p is 
a constant, it is called a p-series. Sometimes 
p-series will try to hide their true identity with
additional constants, but any disguise will be trans-
parent. Remember, you can factor constants

Determining the convergence of a p-series is
easy—all you have to do is examine the p. (Sounds
like something a urologist would do, but don’t let
that bother you.) A p-series will converge if p > 1, but will diverge for all other values of p.
Unlike geometric series, you cannot determine the sum of a convergent p-series using a
handy formula. In fact, you won’t be asked to calculate the sum of an infinite series unless
the series is geometric or telescoping (the next simple series you’ll learn).
Telescoping Series
The key characteristic of telescoping series is that all but one or a few terms of the series will
cancel out, which makes finding the sum of these series extremely easy. All you have to do

the limit at infinity of its defining rule exists.
◆A series is the sum of a specific number of terms of a sequence, as defined by lower

When I first taught series as a high school teacher, I hated them. I loathed
them. I don’t now, but back then it was a different story. In fact, when the
thought of infinite series crossed my mind, my face twisted into an involun-
tary sneer. It could, however, have something to do with the circumstances. I
was the fill-in guy for the real calculus teacher, because she was pregnant.
I didn’t remember a single derivative, integral, or limit from calculus, and now
I had to teach infinite series to a bunch of students who’d probably rather
have seen me disemboweled than listen to explanations for concepts I only
half understood myself. But you probably already know what hating an occa-
sional calculus topic feels like, and I’m preaching to the choir. The good news
is that you have a strong and secure calculus background behind you, so series
convergence tests will be very easy to understand.

Part 5: Differential Equations, Sequences, Series, and Salutations
Which Test Do You Use?
As you may have guessed, this chapter is full of tests used to determine whether or not
infinite series converge. We won’t be able to find sums of any infinite series anymore—
these series are too complex for that—so we’ll settle for simply knowing whether or not
that mystery sum exists.
Like integration problems, infinite series require numerous techniques. Sometimes you’ll
be able to tell what convergence test to use just by looking at a series, but much of the
time, you’ll have to do a little experimenting to find one that works. Have you ever
noticed that it’s easy to choose between things if only given a few options? Well, this
chapter adds six additional convergence tests to the three from last chapter, and it can be
tricky to decide which to choose. Just like everything else in calculus, however, practice
makes perfect. Eventually, you’ll develop an instinct that nudges you toward the correct
method to use based on the look of the problem. Besides, I’ll give you some hints to whip
that instinct into shape.
The Integral Test
In Chapter 18, you learned how to calculate improper integrals by using limits. One of
the major causes of an improper integral was an infinite boundary. Can you see any rela-
tion to infinite limits? Look at the two problems that follow:
These problems look almost identical, just like Super-
man and mild-mannered newspaper reporter Clark
Kent. In fact, the series on the right will converge if the
integral on the left converges (i.e., has a numeric value).
However, if the integral on the left increases without
bound, then so does the infinite sum on the right. This
correlation between the convergence of an infinite
series and its corresponding improper integral is called
the Integral Test.
You can only apply the Integral Test to series that ex-
clusively contain positive terms (called positive series).
You’ll be able to deal with series containing negative
and alternating positive and negative terms with other
tests.
252
The Integral Test states that the 
positive series 
converges 
if the improper integral 
has a finite value. The opposite
is also true—if the definite inte-
gral is infinitely large, the series
diverges. It doesn’t make a lot of
sense to apply the Integral Test to
a function whose graphic is
increasing as 
, because
the area trapped beneath that
curve will not be finite.

Example 1: Use the Integral Test to deter-
mine the convergence of

Solution: As I’ve already mentioned, this 
series will converge if 
is a finite num-
ber. To evaluate the definite integral, you need to
replace the infinite boundary with a limit like you
did in Chapter 18:
You can integrate this fraction via u-substitution with u = 1 + 2n:
As a gets infinitely large, so does 
, so the integral increases without bound and is 
divergent. Therefore, the series 
is also divergent.

The Comparison Test
Even though you are now familiar with many different kinds of series, there are lots of
other series that don’t fit into the cookie-cutter categories. How often are you going to 
see something in a perfect geometric form, like 
? More often than not, 
If

B is a constant, you can assume 
that 
converges, but you 
cannot assume that the sum of
the series is B.

Part 5: Differential Equations, Sequences, Series, and Salutations
you’ll be given series that are almost geometric, but not quite. What a tease! We have a
great technique that is proven to work with geometric series and along comes this series
that smells geometric, feels geometric, but doesn’t act geometric.
If you have siblings, you know what it’s like to be com-
pared to them. “Why can’t you get good grades like your
sister?” and “I wish you could rebuild a transmission with
the clarity and sense of purpose that your brother Hank
can” probably sound familiar to you. Don’t look now—
you’ve turned into your parents: “Why can’t you be a
well-behaved geometric series like that one?”
Fortunately, comparing series to one another is not so
spirit-crushing as comparing people. In fact, you can
use the merits and strengths of the “good” series to
vouch that the well-meaning but slightly misguided sib-
ling series converges or diverges also.
The Comparison Test (also called the Direct Comparison Test): Given two positive infinite 
series 
and 
, such that every term of 
is less than or equal to the corre-
sponding term in 
, 
1) If 
converges, then 
converges.
2) If 
diverges, then 
diverges.
Think about it this way: if some series, called B, eventually converges, and every term in a
series A is smaller than the matching term in B (e.g., the fifth term in A is smaller than
the fifth term in B), then A must also converge. Smaller numbers must add up to a smaller
sum. The divergence clause of the Comparison Test works the same way. A series larger
(on a term-by-term basis) than a divergent series must also be divergent.
Example 2: Use the Comparison Test to show that 
is divergent.
Solution: Forget about the “+2” for now. If it weren’t for that dang 2, you’d have the 
series 
, which is a geometric series with a = 1 and 
. Notice that the 
slightly mutated series containing the “+ 2” term will be larger than its corresponding
geometric series. The denominators in both series are equal, but the numerator in the
mutated series will be two larger than its counterpart for every n you plug in:

As you can probably tell from
the sibling metaphor, the

known series type, but is off by
just a bit. Notice that both the

The Limit Comparison Test
Fractions with n’s raised to exponential powers in both the numerator and denominator
are good candidates for the Limit Comparison Test. Just like in the Direct Comparison
Test, you’ll have to design a comparison series. Let’s say you’re given the positive (but
sloppy) series 
. The comparison series you’ll create will ignore all the terms in the 
numerator and denominator of

the comparison series you created

as n approaches infinity. If the limit exists (i.e., is a positive, finite number), then both
series act the same way—that is to say, both series either converge or diverge. Now that
you’ve got the general idea, here’s what it looks like mathematically.

The Limit Comparison Test only works for positive series, just like the Integral Test
and the Comparison Test. Also, note that the limit in the Limit Comparison Test, if it
exists, only tells you whether both series converge or diverge. The limit is not equal to
the sum of the series, just like the value of the definite integral in the Integral Test was
not equal to the sum of its corresponding series.

Example 3: Use the Limit Comparison Test to determine the convergence of

Solution: This series contains n raised to various powers in both parts of the fraction, so
it’s a good candidate for the Limit Comparison Test. To generate its comparison series,
take only the highest powers of n in the numerator and denominator and ignore the rest
(even the coefficients of those terms). You get a comparison series of 
or 
. Now, evaluate the limit at infinity of the original series divided by the 
new series:
Dividing a fraction by another fraction is equivalent to multiplying the top fraction by the
reciprocal of the bottom one:
Because the limit is a positive finite number, both series converge or diverge. Clearly, the 
comparison series 
is a divergent p-series. Since the comparison series diverges, 
both series diverge.

The Ratio Test
The Ratio Test is very useful for series
whose terms get really big really fast. If the
series in question has exponents, or (even
better) n exponents or factorials, the Ratio
Test is one-stop shopping for all your con-
vergence needs. Both this and the Root Test
(coming up next, so don’t change that dial!) work
like a Magic 8 Ball—ask it whether or not the

happens. Will you understand how to do this?
“Signs point to yes!”

Solution: As n approaches infinity, both the numerator and denominator will get large
quickly, so use the Ratio Test. Plug (n + 1) into n and then multiply the result by the

conclusion. The series may converge, may
diverge, or may just be waiting for the per-
fect moment to punch you in the nose and
scuttle back into the shadows. You’ll have to
Series containing factorials are
prime candidates for the Ratio

rial is? It’s a little exclamation 
point next to a number, like 
this: 5!. Mathematically, 
5! = 5 · 4 · 3 · 2 · 1 = 120. A 
factorial is basically the product
of the number and every integer
that comes before it, down to
and including 1.
Critical Point
The Ratio Test contains the term
an+1, which is just the series
formula with (n + 1) plugged
in for n. In essence, you’re
dividing a term of the series into
the next consecutive term and
examining the result.
Critical Point

Part 5: Differential Equations, Sequences, Series, and Salutations
Here’s how I did that. First of all, (n + 1)! = (n + 1) ⋅n! for the same reason that 5! = (5) ⋅
4! = (5) ⋅4 ⋅3 ⋅2 ⋅1. Second, 2n+1 = 2n ⋅21 because you know that xa+b = xa ⋅xb.
This fraction will increase without bound as n approaches infinity; according to the Ratio
Test, this indicates divergence of the series.
258
The Root Test
The Root Test is the sister of the Ratio Test, because it also examines a limit at infinity
and applies the exact same three conditional results based on how the limit compares to 1.
However, instead of examining the limit of a ratio, it examines the limit of the nth root.
Therefore, this test is best used when all the pieces of the series at hand are raised to the
nth power. Hallelujah! Finally, a series convergence test with an obvious niche! Remem-
ber, just look for everything to the nth power, and you’re on Easy Street.
The Root Test: If 
is an infinite series of positive terms, and 
, then
1)
converges if L < 1,
2)
diverges if L > 1 or if L = ∞, and
3) If L = 1, the Ratio Test can draw no conclusion (just like the Ratio Test).

Series with Negative Terms
Every convergence test works only for positive series. Well, let me tell you something: It’s
hard to be positive all the time. Occasionally, you just need to be negative. On those
mornings I can’t find my car keys and stub my toe on the coffee table while looking for
them, running around like a lunatic because I’m already late, I understand the need to
deal with a series containing negative items. Before we close out this chapter, you’ll learn
two coping mechanisms for dealing with just such a series.
The Alternating Series Test
Most of the series you’ll encounter that contain negative terms are alternating series, which
are series whose consecutive terms have different signs. In other words, every other term has
the same sign. You can test an alternating series for convergence with a relatively simple,
two-part test.
The Alternating Series Test: If 
is an alternating series and the following two 
conditions are met, then 
converges: 
There’s a rule in algebra that says the nth root of something to the nth power must
be contained by absolute value bars after you simplify, but only if n is an even 
number. In other words, 
and 
. Even though the Root Test 
looks a lot like this rule, don’t worry about absolute values—the series is filled with only
positive terms.

Part 5: Differential Equations, Sequences, Series, and Salutations
So if you’ve got an alternating series and you want to determine its convergence, here’s
what you do. First, write out a few terms of the series. Is it clear that every term is smaller
than or equal to the one before it (ignoring the positive and negative signs)? If so, that’s
great—move on to the next step. (If not, then you’ll have to try absolute convergence,
which I’ll talk about in the next section.) Second, you have to make sure the series (again
ignoring the signs) has a limit at infinity of 0.
Example 6: Determine the convergence of 
.
Solution: Start by writing out a few terms of the series:
Man, oh man, that denominator is getting big quickly,
but that’s good because it forces each term of the series
to get smaller and smaller, meeting the first condition of the Alternating Series Test.
(Make sure to ignore the positive and negative signs when you check for term shrinkage.)
One more obstacle remains. You need to evaluate the limit (as n approaches infinity) of
the series formula without the (–1)n+1 piece. Just like you did in the first part of the
Alternating Series Test, keep ignoring those negatives:
260
1) Every term of the series is less than or equal to the term preceding it.
2)
Alternating series are series whose consecutive terms alternate between positives and
negatives. For example,
…
is an alternating series. Usually, alternating series contain (–1)n or (–1)n+1. It is this piece
that causes the signs of the series to alternate, since –1 to an odd power is negative
but is positive when raised to an even power.
Notice that the second part of
the Alternating Series Test
is just the nth term
divergence test from Chapter 22.
Critical Point

Absolute Convergence
Sometimes, the Alternating Series Test fails you.
In such cases, you’ll be forced to examine the
absolute convergence of the series. Basically, you’ll
ignore the signs of the series and use one of the
tests you’ve already learned in this chapter. Ignor-
ing the signs (i.e., assuming that all the terms are
positive) is key, since those convergence tests only
worked for positive series.
Let’s say you start with a series 
, which 
contains some negative terms. Note that this doesn’t have to be an alternating series—it 
just has to contain at least one negative term. If the series 
—which is the original 
series with all minus signs changed to plus signs—converges, then 
converges 
absolutely, meaning that regular old 
is automatically a convergent series, even though 
you couldn’t reach that conclusion via the Alternating Series Test. If, however, 
does not converge using one of the original tests, then you have no idea whether or not 
converges, and everyone goes home dejected, hoping to find something good to 
watch on TV.
Example 7: Determine the convergence of 
.
Solution: This is definitely an alternating series, and the terms definitely shrink as n
grows, but 
.
Since the Alternating Series Test sort of fizzles (you can’t tell if the limit is 0 or not),
check to see if the series converges absolutely. In other words, look at the series:
Chapter 23: Infinite Series Convergence Tests
As long as that limit equals 0 (which it does), it satisfies the second condition of the
Alternating Series Test. Now that both conditions are satisfied, you can conclude that 
converges.
261
Problem 6: Does the series 
converge or diverge?

A series

convergence if 
converges.
Absolute convergence is harder to
achieve than regular convergence,
so if a series converges absolutely,

The Least You Need to Know
◆You can determine the convergence of a series using the Integral Test if the general
term is easily integrated.
◆If a series closely resembles a far simpler series, you can apply the Comparison or
Limit Comparison Test to determine whether or not the series converges.
◆The Ratio and Root Tests require that you calculate a limit at infinity. How this
limit compares to the number 1 tells you whether or not the given series converges.
◆If a series contains alternating negative and positive terms, you have to apply the
Alternating Series Test to see if it converges; if that doesn’t work, test to see whether
the series converges absolutely.
If a series converges absolutely
to a finite sum (which you can
test by ignoring the negative
signs), then when you turn
around and throw those negative
terms back in, they won’t affect
the convergence. If anything, a
few negative numbers would

Now that Chapter 23 is in the rearview mirror, you know a thing or two
about series. Basically, you are a superhero, able to determine series conver-

Power Rule. In this chapter, you’ll learn a few more superhero skills, and then
you’re off to battle villains, desperados, and evil geniuses that build diabolical
weather machines in order to further their plans of world domination.
This chapter will build upon your knowledge of series, with a little twist.
You’re going to start using series that contain variables, so that the result is
not a string of numbers, but a function. Some series can be used to approxi-
mate function values, like linear approximation did in Chapter 21. However,
these series do a much better job of approximating functions, and in fact can
sometimes get the exact function value, even if the function is complicated.
Chapter

Part 5: Differential Equations, Sequences, Series, and Salutations
The grand finale will be a brief study in approximation polynomials that are built from
things called Taylor and Maclaurin series. These are also used to approximate function
values, are based on a series definition, and are much better than linear approximations
when estimating function values. Practically speaking, there’s a little bit more memorizing
ahead of you, but none of the math is new or complex. The real question is this: Is this
the first hour of the last day in your mathematical journey, or merely the last hour of the
first day? There is still much to learn when this short journey ends.
Power Series
We have done a lot of approximating in this book. Many of our techniques began with a
rough way to do things, and then we refined it into a snazzy and more accurate technique.
For example, before we jumped into finding exact area beneath curves using the Funda-
mental Theorem of Calculus, we plodded along, approximating area by shoving known
shapes underneath the curves whose areas we knew—things like rectangles, trapezoids,
and (to break up the monotony) howler monkeys.
During those approximation techniques, it became clear that the more calculations
involved in the process, the more accurate the prediction would be. For example, more
rectangles beneath a curve meant a more accurate Riemann sum. Smaller Δx steps along a
differential equation during Euler’s Method meant a more accurate solution to that differ-
ential equation.
In fact, the best way to get a good approximation is to
use an infinite number of steps. Thanks to infinite
series, you now possess a tool with such capabilities;
and your approximations can get ridiculously close.
Power series are infinite series (containing x’s) centered
around some value c that give insanely close function
approximations for x-values near c, sometimes even
producing the exact function value, even if the function 
is not simple. They have the form 
, where 
an is some formula containing n’s, representing the
coefficient of each term.
Radius of Convergence
Like it or not, your only focus will be to determine where power series converge. The
good news is they always converge somewhere, but the bad news is that there are three
“somewheres” at which the power series could converge:
264
A power series centered at x = c
has form 
and is 
used to approximate function val-
ues close to x = c.

)

Chapter 24: Special Series
◆Only at the value c where the series is centered
◆At all real numbers within some radius r (called the radius of convergence) of the cen-
ter of the series
◆Everywhere

In Example 1, you’ll work through a power
series to find the correct radius of conver-
gence. Here are a few important things I
want you to watch for as the problem pro-
gresses:
◆Using the Ratio Test to ensure
absolute convergence
◆Finding the radius of convergence by forcing
the result into the form
It’s all well and good that power series can theoretically approximate function values.
However, that’s pretty advanced stuff. Let’s be frank about what you’ll actually be
doing. You won’t be designing power series. You probably won’t even know what
functions, if any, the power series are trying to approximate. You’re only concerned
with determining where power series converge. That’s it. Just like the last chapter, you’ll
worry only about convergence.
Critical Point
If a power series is centered around x = 5 and has a radius of convergence of 3, then
that power series converges on the interval (5 – 3,5 + 3) = (2,8). You don’t know if
the series converges at the endpoints of the interval yet—we’ll discuss that in the next
section. You can describe the same interval mathematically like this: 
. In other 
words, a power series centered at x = c with radius of convergence r converges for all 
x that satisfy 
. In simpler terms, if the radius of convergence is r, then the 
power series will converge for any x between c – r and c + r.
The radius of convergence for
a power series that converges
only at its center is r = 0. If the
power series converges for all
real numbers, the radius is infi-
nite. In Example 1, you’ll get the
only other possible radius: a
finite, real number.
Critical Point

Part 5: Differential Equations, Sequences, Series, and Salutations
Example 1: Find the radius of convergence for the power series 
.
Solution: Remember, a power series has form 
, so this power series sets 
and c = 1. Therefore, it can approximate values for some function at least for the 
value of x = 1, and perhaps for some values close by. How close must those x-values be to
make this series converge? That’s the question of the day. Since power series (by defini-
tion) contain things to the n power (which gets large as n approaches infinity), you use 
the Ratio Test to determine where they converge. In addition, you will always examine
absolute convergence, so take the absolute value of the series. Even if this were an alter-
nating series, or just a series with negative terms, you’d follow the same process. Start
with the Ratio Test:
Notice that 
approaches 
as n approaches infinity. The (x – 1) term is 
unaffected by n’s infinite growth, since it contains no n’s. Therefore, the limit equals 
. So, what now? Well, the Ratio Test says that this limit must be less than 1 in 
order for the series to converge, so in order to guarantee convergence, you must know that
At this point, you almost have the form 
. In order to reach that form, multiply
266
both sides by 4; you get 
. This tells you that the radius of convergence 
is 4. Therefore, the series 
will converge on the interval (c – r, c + r) = 
(1 – 4,1 + 4) = (–3,5). This means if you substitute any value on that interval into the x in
the series, the result will be a convergent series.

Chapter 24: Special Series
Interval of Convergence
In Example 1, you determined that the series 
converges within the interval 
(–3,5). However, the series might also converge 
at the endpoints of the interval, x = –3 and x = 5.
By testing the endpoints, you can determine the
interval of convergence.
Example 2: On what interval does the series 
(from Example 1) converge?
Solution: You already know the radius of conver-
gence is 4 and that the series converges inside the
interval (–3,5). All that’s left is to determine the
convergence at the endpoints.
Step One: Test endpoint x = –3
Plug x = –3 into the series:
Rewrite the series to get 
. The series diverges according to the nth 
term divergence test. Conclusion: The series diverges when x = –3.
Step Two: Test endpoint x = 5
When you plug x = 5 into the series and simplify, you get 
, which also diverges 
according to the nth term divergence test. Since the series diverged at both of the 
endpoints, 
has an interval of convergence of (–3,5); neither endpoint is 
included in the interval.

Problem 1: Find the radius of convergence for the power series 
.
You’ve Got Problems
The interval of convergence for a
power series centered at c is
found once you have determined
the radius of convergence, r. You
have to plug each endpoint 
(c – r and c + r) into the series
for x to see if the resulting series
converges or diverges. The series
may converge for both, for nei-
ther endpoint, or maybe just for
one of them.

Maclaurin Series
I love fast food. It’s one of my true weaknesses. There’s something really great about ask-
ing for a cheeseburger, and having one handed to you within 45 seconds. True, it’s a little
off-putting when that cheeseburger sweats so much grease by the time you reach your car
that the bag carrying your food is almost transparent. However, that cruel mistress who is
convenient food sings her siren song, and I keep wandering back.
When you go to a fast-food joint, you don’t really expect to get home-cooked food. (No
one at home wraps their food in paper, puts fries in cardboard envelopes, or keeps food
warm under high-powered red heat lamps.) Nothing ever quite tastes homemade. This is
both good and bad. I’ve always thought that fast-food French fries and soft drinks taste
infinitely better than their homebound cousins, whereas the hamburgers are always a lot
better right off your backyard grill.
Even if the taste is not the same, however, fast food is a relatively good approximation of
home-cooked food. Even better, fast food takes little to no preparation, and you can expe-
rience a whole spectrum of different fast foods from different restaurants without having
to learn additional skills. You order the same way at
Taco Bell, McDonald’s, and Wendy’s—as long as you
have money, you are only seconds away from a tasty
and grease-laden entreé.
Are you wondering where I am going with this meta-
phor? Wonder no longer. Maclaurin series are the fast-
food approximators of the function world. (In my
metaphor, regular functions are home-cooked and
Maclaurin equals McDonald’s.) You have already
learned a method of approximating functions (remem-
ber linear approximation?) but Maclaurin series offer
much more accurate function approximations. All you
have to do is learn one general formula, and suddenly
you can approximate even complicated function values.

.

Next you’ll learn how to use
Taylor series, which work
almost exactly like Maclaurin
series, except that you can
center them at any x-value.
There’s your trade-off. Maclaurin
series are simpler than Taylor
series, but Maclaurin series are,
by definition, centered at x = 0.
If you’re approximating a func-
tion value for an x far from 0,
you’ll have to use the slightly
more complicated Taylor series.
Critical Point

Chapter 24: Special Series
Mathematically, we say the Maclaurin series
approximates values of f(x) 
very accurately, as long as those x-values are close to 0, where the power series is centered.
Believe it or not, you don’t have to worry at all about the convergence of this series! In
fact, when you work with Maclaurin series, you’ll actually be generating Maclaurin polyno-
mials, which are finite bits of the series. 
Before you start generating these polynomials, make sure you understand the formula; it
contains something weird—an exponent in parentheses. In case you don’t know what
f(n)(0) means, it is the nth derivative of f(x) evaluated at 0. For example, f(5)(0) is the fifth
derivative of f(x) with 0 plugged in for x. This is handy notation. It’s pretty obvious that
writing the twelfth derivative of f(x) as f (12)(x) is better than f ′′′′′′′′′′′′(x). (Although you
could make a good argument that the latter notation is really in its “prime.”)
269
Example 3: Use the fifth-degree Maclaurin polynomial for the function f(x) = sin x to
approximate sin (0.1).
Solution: Write the terms of the Maclaurin series from n = 0 to n = 5:
So, you’ll need to take five derivatives of the function f(x) = sin x and then plug 0 into
each one:
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
The Maclaurin series
generates good approximations of f(x), as long as 
x is close to 0. You won’t use an infinite series to do the approximating, however; you’ll
use a definite number of terms of the series. The more terms you use, the better your
approximation will be.

Part 5: Differential Equations, Sequences, Series, and Salutations
270
Now, plug these values into the series. In case you’re con-
fused about how that works, here’s how you create the n = 3 
term, 
. Since f′′′(0) = –1 and 3! = 3 ⋅2 ⋅1 = 6, plug 
those values into the term to get 
. Notice that the 
even-powered function derivatives will disappear in this
example because you end up multiplying by 0 in those
terms:
There you have it—the Maclaurin polynomial of degree 5 for f(x) = sinx. If you plug 
x = 0.1 into the polynomial, you will get an approximation of sin 0.1:
The actual value of sin 0.1 is .099833416647. Wow! Talk about close! I can’t approximate
sin 0.1 to save my life. I barely even know how to start guessing at what its value would be.
However, you got almost that exact value by plugging into a polynomial with three terms. If
you had used n = 7, it would have been an even better approximation.
Take a look at how in (Figure 24.1) the graphs of the Maclaurin polynomials more closely
resemble the graph of the sine function as the number of terms in the Maclaurin polyno-
mial increases. The Maclaurin polynomial slowly shapes itself to exactly match the polyno-
mial as you increase the number of polynomial terms. It reminds me of that movie Single
White Female, where the crazy woman slowly adjusts every aspect of her life to match her
roommate’s with the eventual goal of killing her and taking over her life. I’m not saying
that Maclaurin polynomials are crazy; however, I’m not saying they are not. Be careful.
The first term in the series in
Example 3 is bizarre: 
. There’s no such thing 
as the “zeroth” derivative—that
just means the original function
(you derive it zero times). You
may also wonder what the value
of 0! is. Since the ordinary defi-
nition of factorial doesn’t work
with 0, you have to define its
value separately: 0! = 1.

Taylor Series
Once you know how Maclaurin series work, Taylor series
are a piece of cake. Maclaurin series look so much like
Taylor series because Maclaurin series actually are Taylor
series centered at x = 0. Therefore, a Taylor series is just a
more generic form of the Maclaurin series; it can be cen-
tered at any x-value, not just at x = 0. The goal of a Taylor
series is the same as its predecessor—to approximate func-
tion values. Just like before, you’re only guaranteed a good
approximation if you stay close to the series’ center.
Taylor series look almost identical to Maclaurin series:
Note the differences in the formulas:
◆The derivatives in Taylor series are evaluated at x = c, the center of the approxima-
tion, not automatically at x = 0
◆Rather than raising x to the n power, you raise the quantity (x – c) to the n power
Other than that, the formulas are identical. Therefore, a Taylor polynomial is neither
more nor less accurate than a Maclaurin polynomial—it is equally accurate but meant 
for a different purpose. If you are trying, for example, to approximate a function’s value 
at x = 10.1, you’d need a lengthy Maclaurin polynomial, since 10.1 is far away from
Maclaurin’s mandatory center of x = 0. However, a much shorter Taylor polynomial 
centered at x = 10 will produce a great estimate.
Example 4: Approximate ln (2.1) using a third-degree Taylor polynomial for f(x) = ln x
centered at x = 2.
Solution: In this problem, f(x) = ln x and c = 2. You’re going to need derivatives up to and
including the third derivative, all evaluated at 2:
Problem 3: Use a fourth-degree Maclaurin polynomial for f(x) = ex to approximate e0.25.
You’ve Got Problems
Taylor series have the form 
, and accurately 
estimate values of f(x) near x = c,
center of the approximation.

Chapter 24: Special Series
Plug all that junk into the Taylor polynomial of degree 3:
Plug x = 2.1 into the polynomial:
The actual value of ln 2.1 is .74193734, so the approximation is pretty accurate.

◆Power, Maclaurin, and Taylor series are used to approximate function values close to
the x-value at which they are centered.
◆You find the radius of convergence for power series using the Ratio Test for absolute
convergence.
◆Even very compact Maclaurin polynomials can give very accurate estimates of func-
tion values close to x = 0.
◆Taylor series give estimates just as accurately as Maclaurin series, but you can center
Taylor series at any x-value you choose.

◆Measuring your understanding of all major calculus topics
◆Practicing your skills
◆Determining where you need more practice
Nothing helps you understand math like good old-fashioned practice, and
that’s the purpose of this chapter. You can use it however you like, but I sug-
gest one of the following three strategies:
1. As you finish reading each chapter, skip back here and work on the prac-
tice problems from that chapter.
2. If you’re using this book as a refresher for a class you’ve already taken,
complete this test before you start reading the book. Then, go back and
read the chapters containing problems you missed. After you’ve
reviewed those topics, try these problems again.
3. Save this chapter until the end, and use it to see how much you remem-
ber of each topic when you haven’t seen it for a while.
Because these problems are just meant for practice, and not meant to teach
new concepts, only the answers are given at the end of the chapter, usually
without explanation or justification (unlike the problems in the “You’ve Got
Chapter

Part 5: Differential Equations, Sequences, Series, and Salutations
Problems” sidebars throughout the book). However, these practice problems are designed
to mirror those examples, so you can always go back and review if you forgot something
or need extra practice.
Are you ready? There’s a lot of practice ahead of you—as some problems have multiple
parts there are actually over 110 practice problems in this chapter! (But no one said you
have to do them all at one sitting.)

All of the answers to the problems that haunted you throughout the book are
listed here, organized by chapter. All of the important steps are shown, unless
the skill needed to complete a problem was already discussed in a previous
chapter. For example, once you learn how to do u-substitution in Chapter 15.
I no longer focus on its details if problems in subsequent chapters require u-
substitution as a component of their answers. If I didn’t do that, this appendix
would be a book unto itself!

1. 6x + 9y = 11. Don’t forget that 6x has to be positive to be in standard
form. You may need to multiply everything by –1.
2. 2x – 3y = 6. You can treat (0,–2) as a point or use it as the y-intercept, so
both forms work.

6. (2x + 7)(4x2 – 14x + 49). This is a sum of perfect cubes; a = 2x and b = 7.
7. x = 0,–4. Method one: Factor out 3x. Method two: First divide by 3 to get 
x2 + 4x = 0. Half of 4 is 2, whose square, 4, that should be added to both sides.
Method three: a = 3, b = 12, and c = 0, since there is no constant term.

2. (a) 13. Factor the numerator to get (2x + 3)(x – 5); cancel the (x – 5) terms and plug
in x = 5 into 2x + 3.
(b) 3. The numerator is the difference of perfect cubes (remember the formula?),
which factors to (x – 1)(x2 + x +1); the (x – 1) terms cancel, leaving only x2 + x + 1; 
substitute x = 1 into that expression to get the answer.

(x + 2) terms to get

Using the factoring method,

5. (a) . The degrees of the numerator and denominator are the same.
(b) 0. The denominator has the higher degree; the fact that you’re approaching –∞
doesn’t matter, since all rational functions possessing an infinite limit approach the
same height as x approaches ∞and –∞.
6. e. Break into two limits to get 
; each of these is a separate special 
limit rule. The first limit is equal to 0 (by the third rule) and the other limit is equal
to e (by the last rule), so the answer is 0 + e = e.

1. Discontinuous. Examining the piecewise-defined function, it’s clear that g(1) = –2,
but using the factoring method, you get 
. Because these are unequal, g is
discontinuous at 
x = 1.
2. a = 12. Notice that 
, because 2(–1)2 + (–1) – 7 = –6. (Even though h(x) 
technically doesn’t reach that height, since the domain restriction is x < –1, –6 is still
the left-hand limit as x approaches –1.) Therefore, ax + 6 = –6 when you plug in x = –1.
3. x = 5 (infinite discontinuity), x = –5 (point discontinuity). Factor to get 
; 
a limit exists for x = –5, but not for x = 5.
4. Since g(1) = –2 and g(2) = 4, we know that all values between –2 and 4 are outputs
of g for 1 < x < 2 . Clearly, 0 is between –2 and 4, so the function has a height of 0
(and has an x-intercept) somewhere between x = 1 and x = 2.

that to get g′(x) = 4x + 7. Applying the Product Rule gives you: 
3. Make sure to simplify carefully:
4. 10x(x2 + 1)4. Here you have a function (x2 + 1) inside another function (x5). In the
Chain Rule formula, f(x) = x5 and g(x) = x2 + 1, since f(g(x)) = (x2 + 1)5. Therefore,
you use the Power Rule to derive the outer function (while leaving x2 + 1 alone) and
then multiply by the derivative of x2 + 1 to get 5(x2 + 1)4 ⋅(2x).
5. (a) 19. The instantaneous rate of change is synonymous with the derivative, so find
g′(4); since g′(x) = 6x – 5 because of the Power Rule, g′(4) = 19.
(b) 1. You’ll need to find the slope of the secant line, so first get the points repre-
senting the x-values of –1 and 3 by plugging those x-values into the equation. Since
g(–1) = 14 and g(3) = 18, the endpoints of the secant line are (–1,14) and (3,18). The
secant slope will be

1. y = 15x + 5. The point of tangency is (–1,–10) and since g′(x) = 9x2 – 2x + 4, g′(–1) = 15.
Point-slope form gives you y – (–10) = 15(x – (–1)), which you can put into slope-
intercept form like I did, if you wish.

2x3 – 18 = 36, and solve for x by adding 18 to both sides, dividing both sides by 2,
and then cube rooting both sides of the equation.

1. First of all, h′(x) = –2x + 6. When you set that equal to 0 and solve, you get the criti-
cal number of x = 3. Choose numbers before and after 3 and plug them into the
derivative—for example, h′(2) = 2 and h′(4) = –2. Since the derivative changes from
positive to negative, the function changes from increasing to decreasing at x = 3, so
the critical number represents a relative maximum.
2. Find the derivative: g′(x) = 6x2 – 7x – 3; critical points occur where this equals 0 (it is
never undefined). So factor to get (3x + 1)(2x – 3); critical numbers are 
and

Because f ′(x) is positive on the intervals 
and 
, f(x) is increasing on
those intervals.
3. Absolute max: 32; absolute min: –52. Notice that g′(x) = 3x2 + 8x + 5, which factors
into (3x + 5)(x + 1), so 
and x = –1 are both critical numbers. A wiggle graph 
verifies that they are also relative extrema. Test all four x-value candidates, including 
those and the endpoints: g(–5) = –52, 
, g(–1) = –4, and g(2) = 32.

. Again, I usually set it equal to 0 and find the x-intercepts 
(i.e., solve the equation 
). Negative answers make no sense and 
should be discarded. (Negative time is nonsensical.)
2. The correct order is: the average velocity, the velocity at t = 7, and lastly the speed
at t = 3. The average velocity is the slope connecting the points (2,–4) and (6,–48): 
in/sec. The velocity at t = 7 is v(7) = s′(7) = 6.5 in/sec. The 
298
speed at t = 3 is the absolute value of the velocity there: 
in/sec.
3. t = 3 seconds. Since s″(t) = 3t – 10, the answer is the solution to the equation 
3t – 10 = –1.
4. 585.204 meters. The position equation will be s(t) = –4.9t2 + 100t + 75. The highest
point reached by the cannonball is the relative maximum of the position equation.
Since 
is the time the ball reaches this height 
(verify it’s a max using the Second Derivative Test if you like—s″(t) is always nega-
tive). Thus, the maximum height of the cannonball is s(10.204), which is approxi-
mately 585.204 meters.

the x-axis, so it must be horizontal; this means everything must be in terms of y. 
Solve both of your equations for x to get x = y2 and 
:

The radius is y units above the origin, so d(y) = y, while the length of the radius is 
the right equation minus the left equation: 
. The equations intersect 
at y values of 0 and 1. Plug everything into the shell method:

4. g(x) = x3. Use the arc length formula to find the length of each separately:
The cubic graph is steeper, so it covers more ground during the same x-interval.

1. y = arcsin
. Divide both sides by (x2 – 1) and multiply both sides by
cos y to get:
Integrate both sides (use u-substitution for the right side):
Finally, solve for y by taking the arcsine of both sides (i.e., cancel out sine with its
inverse function).
2. Integrate the acceleration function to find velocity. Since you know that v(0) = –2,
substitute these values once you’ve integrated:

Therefore, v(t) = t2 + 5t + cos t – 3. Integrate to get the position function, this time

3. 31.434 days. First things first; you need to calculate k. The initial amount is 15,000,
so that will equal N. After t = 3.82 days, 7,500 grams remain, so plug into the expo-
nential decay equation:
Thus, the model for exponential decay is y = 15,000e–0.181452t. Set it equal to 50 and

1. Diverge. The sequence converges if 
exists. To evaluate the limit, you
should use L’Hôpital’s Rule:
Because 
increases without bound as n approaches infinity, the limit does not exist, 
313
making the sequence 
divergent.
2. Diverge. According to the nth term divergence test, 
must diverge since 
. The sine function does not approach any fixed value as n increases—it 
oscillates infinitely between the values of 1 and –1.
3. Converges to a sum of 12. This is a geometric series with a = 4 and 
. Because
, the series converges to this sum:
4. Convergent. You can pull out the constant and rewrite the negative exponent to get 
this p-series: 
. Since p = 3 and 3 > 1, the series converges.

Appendix A
5. 1. If you write out the expansion, you can easily tell that this is a telescoping series:
In fact, all the terms of the series cancel out except the 1.
Chapter 23
1. Divergent. If the integral 
(which can be solved via u-substitution with 
u = ln n) diverges, so will the original series:
2. Convergent. If it weren’t for the 3 in the denominator, you’d have a p-series, so 
compare the given series to the convergent p-series 
. Notice that 
for all n, since the “+ 3” in the denominator will decrease the fraction’s value.
(Adding in the numerator makes a fraction greater, and adding in the denomi-
nator does the opposite.) Therefore, 
must be convergent according to the 
Comparison Test, because it is smaller than a convergent p-series.
3. Convergent. Since both parts of the fraction contain n raised to a power, the Limit 
Comparison Test is a great idea. A good comparison series would be 
, which 
can be simplified as 
. Now, calculate the limit of the quotient of the two 
series:
314

Solutions to “You’ve Got Problems”
Because the limit is positive and finite, and 
is a convergent p-series, then 
also converges.
4. Convergent. Applying the Ratio Test, you get:
Because 0 < 1, the series converges.
5. Convergent. You can rewrite this series as 
or 
. Apply the Root 
Test, since everything is raised to the nth power:
Since 0 < 1, this series converges.
6. Divergent. It is clearly an alternating series whose terms grow smaller as n gets
larger and larger. Even though the numerator of the series gets bigger by 1 for each
consecutive term, the denominator grows by more than a factor of 3. However, the
series fails the second part of the Alternating Series Test since:
The limit at infinity must equal 0 for the series to converge, and it just doesn’t.
315

Appendix A
7. Convergent. The Alternating Series Test fails, since the limit at infinity results in an
indeterminate answer. Test for absolute convergence by examining the series 
. If you rewrite the series as 
, it’s obvious that you’re dealing with 
a geometric series whose ratio is . Since 
, the series 
converges, which 
means that 
also converges, because it converges absolutely.
Chapter 24
1. ∞. Begin with the Ratio Test for absolute convergence:
As n approaches infinity, 
approaches 0. Remember that the limit has to be less 
than 1 in order for the series to converge:
Hold the phone! No matter what x is, you get 0 on the left side of the inequality, and
0 is always less than 1. Therefore, this series will converge regardless of the value of
x, meaning that the series converges on the interval (–∞,∞).
2. (1,3]. First, find the radius of convergence using the Ratio Test for this power series
centered around x = 8. The (–1)n + 1 term is omitted thanks to the absolute value
signs:
Remember, the series only converges when 
. Because this is in the form 
, you know that the radius of convergence is 1, and the series converges 
inside the interval (8 – 1, 8 + 1) = (7,9). Now, you should check to see if the series
converges at the endpoints. Start with x = 7:
316

Solutions to “You’ve Got Problems”
This is the harmonic series, which is divergent. Now, check the other endpoint, 
x = 9:
This series converges according to the Alternating Series Test. Therefore, you must
include x = 3 in the interval of convergence, (1,3].
3. 1.284017. No matter what derivative you take of f(x) = ex, f (n)(0) = e0 = 1. Therefore,
the Maclaurin polynomial will be …
Plug x = 0.25 into the polynomial to get your approximation:
If you’re curious, e0.25 is approximately 1.284025.
4. 2.049375. You need to find up to the second derivative of f(x) = x1/2, eventually each
derivative for x =  4:
