About the Author
Bill Kresnak is a popular motojournalist with more than 35 years of experi-
ence riding all types of motorcycles, from dirt bikes and cruisers to some of
the fastest sportbikes on the planet. He currently is the government affairs
editor for American Motorcyclist magazine, the magazine of the American
Motorcyclist Association (AMA), which is the largest motorcycling organiza-
tion devoted to rights, riding, and racing in the world. Kresnak is intimately
familiar with safe motorcycle riding practices through his work at the AMA,
but he also has toured many parts of the country by motorcycle and has
reported on some of the biggest motorcycling events in the nation. Before
becoming a motojournalist, Kresnak worked for almost 20 years as a reporter
in Honolulu, where he covered government and politics — first for United
Press International and then for The Honolulu Advertiser. He earned his jour-
nalism degree from Michigan State University in 1978, and he currently lives
in Reynoldsburg, Ohio.


Dedication
For my young children, Adrian Samantha and Joshua Enoch Keoki, and their
mom, Sheryll, who all still find a remarkable wonder in each day; for Cindy
Shultz, my muse who convinced me to sit down and write when I really
wanted to go out and ride; and for all my friends, who are also my colleagues,
at the American Motorcyclist Association; they are the most knowledgeable,
dedicated motorcyclists in the world who do a tremendous job of fostering
motorcyclists’ rights, riding, and racing.

Introduction
You see motorcyclists everywhere: having a good time navigating city
streets, enjoying the ocean air while cruising along the beach, or just
having fun riding in the countryside. To the outsider, motorcycling is simple.
It’s just motorcyclists out having fun.
And while it’s true that motorcycling is simple, it’s also a lot more complex
than just a rider, a bike, and a good time. In fact, there are facets to the sport
that even many longtime motorcyclists don’t understand.
It’s easy to have a lot of fun on a motorcycle without knowing a whole lot
about motorcycling. But it’s even more fun when you do. And it’s also a lot
safer when you know about the proper riding techniques, the safety gear, the
items you should take with you on long trips, and the handling characteris-
tics of different types of motorcycles.
Motorcycling really is a mysterious world to the outsider, to the new rider, and
even to some experienced riders. But, really, it isn’t that difficult to understand
the complexities of motorcycling; it just takes some time to discover them all.
In fact, sometimes it takes years — unless, of course, you read this book.
And to be frank, you’ll meet a lot of “know-it-alls” in the motorcycling world.
But, unlike those folks, I have a lot of knowledge and facts to back up my
statements! I began riding when I was 17, and I have been passionate about
motorcycles ever since. I’ve done a little bit of racing, and I’ve covered all
aspects of the sport as a motojournalist for almost a decade.
So, it has taken me about 35 years of being heavily involved in motorcycling
to learn everything I know. And with all that knowledge, I wrote this book for
new riders, serious riders, and even people who don’t ride but want to under-
stand a friend or relative who does.
About This Book
For new riders, this book is full of the useful information that’s needed to
confidently get started in the wonderful world of motorcycling. I cover every-
thing you need to know. I explain different types of motorcycles, the various
motorcycling cultures, how to fit in with other motorcyclists, how to get your
motorcycle license, safe riding techniques, and much, much more.

For the experienced rider, this book is just as useful. It’s chock-full of informa-
tion and useful tips to make motorcycling a lot more enjoyable and safer, too.
I also delve into topics such as how to keep your bike from getting ripped off
both at home and on the ride, what essential items you need to take on a
week-long trip, and how to plan a rewarding trip when you have a limited
amount of time.
All riders can benefit from the strategies in this book, especially those strate-
gies for buying a new or used bike, selecting the proper safety gear, getting
your child involved in motorcycling, and understanding the ins and outs of
insurance. Plus, I cover fun stuff like motorcycling movies, major motorcy-
cling events, and customizing your motorcycle.
My goal for this book is to help all riders understand the richness of motorcy-
cling, the camaraderie, and why it’s such a passion not only for me but for
motorcyclists around the world.
And the greatest thing about this book is that each chapter is written in a
simple, understandable way so that even people with zero motorcycling
experience (as well as those with many years’ experience on the road) can be
entertained and benefit. Motorcycling is fun, and the best way to make this
motorcycling book fun to read is to simply jump around to the sections and
chapters that interest you the most. In fact, even the sections of the chapters
are easy to read and digest. Feel free to jump around to different chapters
and different sections any time you want.
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you navigate this book with ease, I include the following few 
conventions:
 Boldfaced words highlight the keywords in bulleted lists and numbered
steps.
 Italics emphasize keywords and important terms.
 Monofont indicates Web addresses.
When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have needed to break
across two lines of text. If that happens, rest assured that I haven’t put in any
extra characters (such as hyphens) to indicate the break. So, when using one
of these Web addresses, just type in exactly what you see in this book, pre-
tending as though the line break doesn’t exist.

What You’re Not to Read
As you’re going through this book, feel free to skip any text marked with the
Technical Stuff icon. This text is interesting, but it isn’t essential to your
understanding of the topic. The sidebars, which are the gray shaded boxes
you see throughout this book, are also skippable (but I highly suggest you
read these fun and interesting tidbits!).
Foolish Assumptions
I assume that you have an interest in motorcycling; otherwise, you wouldn’t
be reading this book. Maybe you think motorcycling looks like a lot of fun but
you want to learn more about it before shelling out the big bucks for your
very own bike. Or maybe you’re an experienced rider looking for good tips to
make your riding safer and more fun. Or maybe you just know a motorcyclist
and want to find out why he or she is so passionate about motorcycling. No
matter why you’ve picked up this book, you’re bound to find the info you
need, because I’ve written it with you in mind.
If you’re a new rider or a potential rider, you may have picked up this book to
get answers to some of these questions:
 How can I possibly fit in with that tough-looking motorcycling crowd?
 How much is it going to cost me for a bike and safety gear to get started
in motorcycling?
 I’m a woman. What special challenges do I face getting into motorcycling?
 What riding techniques do I absolutely need to know to be safe on the
road?
 What’s a good bike for a beginning motorcyclist?
If you’re an experienced rider, you already have a passion for motorcycling
and a desire to learn even more. If you fall into this category, you may have
questions like this:
 What are some advanced riding techniques I need to master so that I’m
prepared for any situation on the road?
 What are some travel tips that ensure I can have a safe and enjoyable
long-distance ride?
3
Introduction

 Which of the mega-motorcycling rallies around the country is best for
me to attend?
 Which motorcycling organizations should I belong to in order to get the
most out of motorcycling?
If you don’t ride a motorcycle, but have a loved one or friend who does,
maybe you have questions like these:
 How can anyone in their right mind ride a motorcycle when they’re so
dangerous? That is, what’s the allure of riding one?
 Why do some motorcyclists wear black jackets that make them look so
scary while others have colorful jackets (sometimes even with touches
of pink)?
 Are motorcyclists lone wolves or social animals?
In Motorcycling For Dummies, you get the answers to all these questions and
more. This book isn’t just Motorcycling 101; it’s a fairly complete collection of
what every motorcyclist needs to know.
How This Book Is Organized
The six parts of this book are organized so that you can find what you need to
know quickly. Each part is centered on a specific topic, so simply determine
what it is that you need to know and then check out the corresponding part.
Part I: The Mysterious 
World of Motorcycling
If you’ve never ridden a motorcycle or hung around with motorcycling types,
you’re probably wondering what the attraction is. Why do bankers, lawyers,
movie stars, and factory workers all ride motorcycles? Why are there so
many different types of motorcycles? After all, isn’t just one style good enough?
And why has the media portrayed motorcyclists as thugs? Are they all really
bad seeds? Finally, you may wonder how someone learns to ride a motorcy-
cle. In this part, I reveal the answers. If you’re more experienced and know
the answers, you’ll still appreciate this part because I reveal some of the
little-known history of motorcycling, and some of the knowledge experienced
riders can gain by becoming involved in a track school or getting other
advanced riding training.

Motorcycling For Dummies 

Part II: Welcome to the Club
So you’ve decided to get into motorcycling? Great! Remember that there are a
lot of different subcultures in motorcycling. But don’t worry. This part explains
all of the subcultures so you can decide which crowd you want to run with.
And if you’re in the market for a bike, this is the part for you. Here I reveal the
different styles and cultures associated with them. In this part, I also provide
some special advice and tips for women, and what everyone needs to know
to suit up for the ride. Plus, if your kids want to ride, this part provides the
info on how to get them started safely. All in all, this part gives you the infor-
mation that you need to feel like a veteran rider.
Part III: You and Your Machine
This part is the real nuts-and-bolts part of the book. It explains what makes a
good beginner machine, and it shows you what’s available out there. I spell
out what to look for when buying a new or used motorcycle, and I show you
how to maintain your machine to keep it running properly. Plus, because motor-
cycling is about individuality, I discuss how to customize your bike to make it
your own. And, of course, you need insurance for your machine, so I include all
the important info. Motorcycle insurance, in some aspects, is different from that
which you buy for your car, so don’t feel like you can skip this chapter.
Part IV: Let’s Ride!
This part has all the really fun stuff that’s important for both novice riders
and long-time veterans. For instance, what ritual should you follow before
taking off on a ride? What are some of the proven techniques for handling
obstacles and other dangers while on the road? And how do you deal with
potential disasters such as a stuck throttle. How do you ride safely in a large
group? Where are some great places to ride, and how does someone plan a
dream motorcycle trip? All this, and more, is explored in this part.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Do you need a quick hit to take care of your motorcycling jones? This is the
place to look. Here, you find some quick hits in bite-sized morsels that give
you a little taste of motorcycling. In these chapters, you get a quick look at
some of the best motorcycling events on the planet, some of the greatest
motorcycling organizations in the United States, and some of the greatest
5
Introduction

men and women ever involved in the sport. Plus, there’s a rundown of motor-
cycling movies, from the great to the, well, not-so-great.
Part VI: Appendixes
Motorcyclists have their own vocabulary, and there are some key words 
that all motorcyclists must know. What are they? You’ll find them in this part.
But wait, there’s more! If you want to make a cross-country trip — and what
motorcyclist doesn’t? — there are key motorcycling laws you need to know for
every state. Finally, you can never have too much information when it comes to
motorcycling, so in the last appendix, I provide a sampling of great motorcyling
resources that provide everything from places to buy gear to trip-planning tips.
Icons Used in This Book
In this book, you find icons — little symbols in the margins of the pages — to
point out different types of information. The information highlighted by these
icons is easy to understand and gives you important time- or money-saving tips.
It can also warn you of dangers. Here’s a list of the icons I use in this book:
This icon highlights the technical stuff that motorheads know but that isn’t
critical for you to know. However, feel free to read these tidbits and then
throw them out at biker gatherings. Your riding buddies will be impressed.
This icon points out pieces of information that are — you guessed it —
important to remember.
When you see this icon you know you’re looking at information that will save
you time, money, or effort.
Beware! Read this info carefully because it will keep you from losing money,
getting hurt, or being a danger to others.
Where to Go from Here
This book isn’t meant to be read from front to back and from cover to cover.
However, because you have an interest in motorcycling, you’ll probably read
6
Motorcycling For Dummies 

the entire book eventually anyway. Just remember that the book is designed
so that you can jump around to the parts and chapters that interest you most
when you want.
For example, if you’re a woman, you may want to read the chapter about
women in motorcycling first. If you’re an experienced rider, maybe you’ll
start with the chapter on what to be sure to pack for a long trip. And if you’re
a new rider undecided about what kind of motorcycle you may want to buy,
maybe you’ll start by reading the chapters involving different motorcycling
cultures or different beginner bikes.
Who knows, maybe you just get bored one Saturday night and want to rent a
bunch of motorcycle movies for the evening but don’t know which ones. In
that case, just turn to Chapter 21 and take your pick. On the other hand, if it’s
time to get or renew your motorcycle insurance, flip to Chapter 10 to be sure
you understand what kind of insurance you need so you don’t spend more
money than you should.
And if you need to, simply take a look at the table of contents and the index
to pick a topic and dive in. After you start down the road of motorcycling,
you’ll never turn back because motorcycling is all about having fun. And so 
is this book.

f you take a look around you see motorcycles every-
where. Doctors ride them, and so do lawyers, movie
stars, and factory workers. But why? After all, if you want
to get from Point A to Point B safely and surrounded by
luxury wouldn’t you just drive a car? Well, I suppose, but
riding a motorcycle isn’t just about getting from Point A to
Point B. In this part, I explain the allure of motorcycling
for so many people.
I also reveal why motorcyclists believe, correctly, that
they’re part of a special club, not only because of the
skills involved in riding but also because of the rich his-
tory of the sport. Plus, I give you a heads-up on how to get
proper motorcycle safety training, what to expect in class,
and what you need to do to get your motorcycle endorse-
ment on your car driver’s license. Armed with this knowl-
edge, you’re ready to get started in the wonderful world of
motorcycling.

Chapter 1
The Allure of Motorcycling: 
Six Million Motorcyclists 
Can’t Be Wrong
In This Chapter
 Discovering the joy of motorcycling
 Understanding the glamorous side of motorcycling
 Fitting in as a woman in a traditionally male motorcycling world
 Sharing motorcycling with children
 Exploring motorcycle safety
“M
otorcycles Are Everywhere.” That’s a popular bumper sticker that
bikers like to hand out to car drivers to encourage them to watch
for motorcycles on the road. Car drivers aren’t trained to look for bikes, so
many times they don’t see them.
The fact is, motorcycles are everywhere. Motorcyclists cruise the highways
and byways, ride along city streets, and tackle twisty roads in the mountains.
Some 6 million motorcyclists drive in the United States today, including every-
one from California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to movie stars Brad Pitt
and Angelina Jolie; to TV talk show host Jay Leno; to doctors, lawyers, accoun-
tants, factory workers, and probably one or more of your neighbors.
Next time you’re driving on the road, make a conscious effort to actually look
for motorcycles — you’ll be surprised by how many you actually see. And
you’ll wonder why you didn’t see them before. Motorcycles are everywhere.
In this chapter, you discover why motorcyclists are addicted to motorcycling,
why every ride on a motorcycle is an adventure, and why a motorcyclist laughs
under his helmet when some hotshot in a Lamborghini pulls up alongside
and revs his or her engine. You also get a taste of what it actually feels like to
be a motorcyclist, and you get a look at the glamorous world of motorcycle

racing. Plus, you discover how women are making inroads into motorcycling,
and why a chick who rides her own bike isn’t just cool, but supercool. And, of
course, you explore motorcycle riding techniques and safety, and how to
have great motorcycling fun with your kids.
Are Bikes Better Than Cars? You Bet!
A car driver shouldn’t even try to convince a motorcyclist that cars are
better than bikes. There’s just no comparison. You want basic transportation
with a lot of cool factor? A motorcycle has it in spades. You want cheap trans-
portation that’s a lot of fun to ride? Yep, that’s a motorcycle. You want plush
seats, climate control, protection from the rain, and the ability to carry a lot
of dogs and stuff? Okay, get a car.
Unless a motorcyclist needs to carry a lot of stuff or it’s bitter cold outside
with ice on the road, a motorcyclist prefers to ride his or her motorcycle. A
motorcycle gives a motorcyclist a true sense of freedom, even when making
only a short hop down to the grocery store for a quart of milk. That’s true for
a lot of reasons, and in this section, I point out a few of the best.
Just in case the reasons I list in this section aren’t enough, here’s one more:
Under federal law, a motorcycle is allowed to use every high-occupancy vehi-
cle (HOV) lane in the United States without having to carry a passenger.
Motorcycling has a certain mystique
One reason motorcyclists prefer their bikes to cars is the long history of
motorcyclists being seen as out-of-the-ordinary. They’re seen as people who
are willing to add a little adventure to their lives and who maybe are a little
rough around the edges. Part of this mystique is the thrill of throwing a leg
over a motorcycle and feeling the wind rush by as you ride. And part of it is
just knowing that you belong to a motorcycling fraternity that includes not
only some of the roughest, toughest guys on the planet, but also some of the
richest and most glamorous people in the world.
Just about everybody drives a car. But not everybody rides a motorcycle. That
alone makes motorcyclists special. Throw in how motorcyclists feel about
themselves when they ride, the fact that a motorcycle gets two or even three
times the gas mileage that a car does, and the exhilaration of controlling a
nimble machine, and you have a combination that adds up to just plain fun.
And really, fun is what motorcycling is all about. How many people have fun
when they get in their cars to drive somewhere? For most people, driving the
12
Part I: The Mysterious World of Motorcycling 

car isn’t part of the experience of going somewhere; driving is just transporta-
tion. A motorcycle is transportation, but it’s also recreation. Motorcyclists are
fond of saying that when they have a rough day at work or just want to clear
their minds of any troubles, they go for a ride.
Enjoying the outdoors, biker style, 
is great fun
Imagine that, one sunny day, you decide to take a little trip through farm
country into the mountains. Should you take your bike or your car?
Decisions, decisions. Not! You hop on your bike, start it up, and hear the
motor roar to life. You feel the vibration of the machine, put it in gear, and
head out of your driveway toward the countryside.
Cruising along country roads, you feel the warm sun on your face and a sooth-
ing, warm breeze rushing past your body, and you smell the sweet fragrance
of wildflowers along the road. Cows graze lazily in pastures as you ride by, and
you get a strong whiff of, well, cow manure. Okay, so riding in the country isn’t
always a party for your senses. But most of the time it is, and when you’re
boxed up in a car riding those country roads, the experience just isn’t the same.
Getting off the straight, country roads, you find yourself starting to wind up
into the mountains. The road gets steeper, the air cools, and you fall into a
rhythm, leaning the bike left, right, left as you climb higher and higher, the
strong smell of pine filling your nostrils. You get to a point when the road is
just snaking turns with few straights, so you lean the bike over farther to
make the turns. On the country roads you were just enjoying the scenery,
sights, and sounds, but now you are focused on the road and mastering every
corner. It’s a challenge, but it’s intensely satisfying.
Near the top of the mountain is a lookout, and you see that you aren’t alone.
Other bikers have also made the trip and have stopped at the lookout to
drink in the view. You stop, enjoy the great weather and scenery, and chat.
After all, motorcyclists are always instant friends. “Where are you from?”
“What are you riding?” “Have you ever been to . . .?”
One by one, the motorcyclists hop on their bikes, click them into gear, and
head back down the mountain. You wait, now alone at the lookout, basking in
the sun and the silence. Too soon it’s time to go. Heading down the mountain,
you decide to take a little ride past the beach before you head home.
As you cruise along the beach, heads turn, people smile, and children wave.
You slow to a crawl to enjoy the scenery. All is right with the world. Motorcy-
cling really is a sensory experience that you just can’t get driving a car.
13
Chapter 1: The Allure of Motorcycling: Six Million Motorcyclists Can’t be Wrong

Every ride is an adventure
Mount up and head out! Today’s motorcyclists are modern-day cowboys,
seeking adventure wherever they go. And the adventure isn’t always the des-
tination. In fact, most times it isn’t. The adventure is the ride itself.
Besides feeling alive while riding a bike because all the senses are at work, a
motorcyclist enjoys the satisfaction of operating his or her machine. Operating
a motorcycle requires a lot of coordination, and operating one well takes a lot
of skill. Motorcyclists hone their skills every time they hop on a bike, and
they get better every day.
So where does the adventure begin? It begins as soon as you stick the key
into the bike’s ignition switch. You know that this is just the start of a lot of
fun, whether the ride is for an hour or a day. Can riding in the city be an
adventure? It sure can: You’re dodging potholes, navigating traffic, and cross-
ing railroad tracks. Car drivers usually don’t think about all these situations,
but motorcyclists must in order to stay safe. As a result, motorcyclists have
heightened awareness not only of potential road hazards, but also of the traf-
fic around them and the potentials for other danger.
Motorcyclists can have the most fun on twisty roads, even at legal speeds.
For a motorcyclist, nirvana is navigating the twists and turns of a curvy road
at a spirited pace. Being in total control of the machine, being one with the
bike, is almost Zen-like. Having a heightened awareness is much more critical
for a motorcyclist than a car driver. After all, if a car goes off the road, the
driver has a lot of steel surrounding him or her in a crash. But a motorcy-
clist? Miss a corner and hit a tree, and the results can be deadly.
To make the ride really special, top it off with a great destination. Maybe you
want to ride to the local motorcyclist gathering place to talk about motorcycling
and great rides, or maybe you’re heading to a giant rally of motorcyclists where
you can meet like-minded riders, test-ride the latest offerings of the motorcycle
manufacturers, and find deals on that new jacket or helmet you need.
And motorcyclists don’t always ride alone. They’re social animals; they like
to share the adventure. Little is more fun than hooking up with a bunch of
riding buddies and heading off to cruise the beach, explore small towns, or
test your skills on some of the twistiest roads in the area. Even more fun is
the good-natured ribbing that follows every ride when someone makes a mis-
take, like taking a corner too wide or braking way too early for a turn. Or even
getting lost.
Car drivers might get annoyed when they get lost, but bike riders generally
don’t seem to mind it. After all, getting lost is part of the adventure of motor-
cycling — exploring new roads and new towns. Who would have thought that
getting lost could be fun? A motorcyclist.
14
Part I: The Mysterious World of Motorcycling 

Can you say C-H-E-A-P?
Motorcycles attract a lot of riders because they’re a lot of fun packed into a
small, nimble, inexpensive package. After all, you can get a great new motor-
cycle for $7,000. And how much is a new car? You want state-of-the-art tech-
nology? Okay, maybe you’ll have to spend around $10,000 for a new bike.
How much is a new car, again? If you just want cheap, reliable transportation,
you can get a good bike for around $1,000. What kind of car can you get for a
grand? Probably not much more than a junker.
Plus, with gas hovering around the $3-per-gallon mark, a motorcycle is the way
to go. Maybe your car gets 25 miles to the gallon. A gas-guzzling motorcycle gets
about 45 miles per gallon, and other motorcycles get even better gas mileage.
Motorcyclists do the math and know how to keep money in their pockets.
Riding a motorcycle brings other cost-saving benefits as well. Annual registra-
tion is cheaper because registration is usually based on vehicle weight —
and, of course, motorcycles weigh a lot less than cars. Some cities have free
motorcycle parking to encourage the use of motorcycles to reduce traffic
congestion. Road tolls are also usually cheaper as well. Plus, depending on
your age, locale, and the type of bike you ride, you’ll shell out a lot less cash
for a motorcycle than you would for a car.
Performance: What car drivers 
don’t want you to know
Maybe you have a bud who likes to take his car to the dragstrip now and
then, and he brags about his 13-second quarter-mile times or about how his
car can go from 0 to 60 mph in 7 seconds. Well, as a motorcyclist, you can
just nod your head knowingly and smile smugly. You can smoke him at that
track on your bike.
Even the most high-performance car on the planet (which probably costs
hundreds of thousands of dollars) can’t match the performance of today’s
high-performance motorcycles (which, incidentally, cost around $12,000).
High-performance motorcycles can do the quarter-mile in a little more than
nine or ten seconds. You want 0-to-60-mph performance? Put another way,
you want to get from stoplight to stoplight quickly? Well, you can get bikes
that do 0 to 60 mph in 2.8 seconds. No bragging — just fact. And a car can’t
match the acceleration of a motorcycle from 60 mph to 80 mph, which is
great for passing on the freeway.
15
Chapter 1: The Allure of Motorcycling: Six Million Motorcyclists Can’t be Wrong

Want proof? Consider a 2007–2008 limited production (only 20 built)
Lamborghini Reventon high-performance sports car, and a 2008 Suzuki
Hayabusa mass-produced high-performance motorcycle:
Category
Reventon
Hayabusa
MSRP
$1,485,100
$11,999
0 to 60 mph
3.3 seconds
2.8 seconds
Top speed
211 mph
186 mph (factory-set limit)
If you really think about it, these stats make sense. After all, the power-to-
weight ratio of a motorcycle far exceeds that of a car. Motorcycles are very
light, and the motors of the high-performance bikes pump out 150, 160, even
170 horsepower. Think about your own car. How much horsepower does it
have? Maybe 150 or 200 horsepower? And what does it weigh? Maybe 3,000
pounds, compared to maybe 400 or 500 pounds or less for a high-perfor-
mance bike? You do the math.
Plus, the high-performance motorcycle market is extremely competitive. The
manufacturers have to employ cutting-edge technology to make their motors
powerful and to keep their suspensions up to snuff to handle the perfor-
mance. Otherwise they’ll drop out of the market.
Even motorcycles that aren’t considered high-performance bikes can smoke
cars on the quarter-mile. Maybe a few high-performance production cars that
cost hundreds of thousands of dollars have higher top speeds than today’s
motorcycles. But high-performance motorcycles can go up to 186 mph (300
kph). The motorcycle manufacturers have a gentlemen’s agreement to cap
the top speed of their bikes at 186 mph because of rumblings in Europe a
while back that motorcycles were being made to go too fast.
The bottom line is that even bikes that aren’t high-performance machines
generally can outperform a car. “So what?” the car guys may say with their
feelings hurt. High performance isn’t just for bragging rights; although that’s
fun, too. High performance gives motorcycle riders a safety edge to get out of
the way quickly when a car changes lanes into the path of the motorcycle, or
to stop quickly to avoid a collision.
The Glamour of Motorcycling
Okay, quick quiz. What do the following people have in common: Ben Affleck,
Jessica Alba, Catherine Bell, James Belushi, Nicolas Cage, George Clooney,
Tom Cruise, Billy Ray Cyrus, Leonardo DiCaprio, Fabio, Laurence Fishburne,
Harrison Ford, Mel Gibson, Sammy Hagar, Hulk Hogan, Kate Hudson, and
Lauren Hutton?
16
Part I: The Mysterious World of Motorcycling 

And what about Billy Joel, Angelina Jolie, Perry King, Queen Latifah, Hugh
Laurie, Jay Leno, Lyle Lovett, Ricky Martin, Ewan McGregor, Juan Pablo
Montoya, Kyle Petty, Richard Petty, Brad Pitt, Dennis Rodman, Arnold
Schwarzenegger, Bruce Springsteen, Billy Bob Thornton, Bruce Willis, and
Dwight Yoakam?
They’re all celebrities — the “beautiful people” — and they all ride motorcy-
cles. In fact, a lot of them are hard-core motorcyclists. Sure, Ewan McGregor
is well known for portraying Obi-Wan Kenobi in the Star Wars movies. But
many movie-lovers also followed his filmed exploits with buddy Charley
Boorman when they traveled from London to New York by way of Europe,
Mongolia, and Canada. The television series was called Long Way Round.
Or consider Catherine Bell, a star of the television series JAG, who also starred
in the movie Bruce Almighty. At last count, she had a dozen motorcycles. And
singer Lyle Lovett loves to ride motorcycles on the street and in the dirt.
Before he died in 1990, multimillionaire Malcolm Forbes was famed for taking
bike trips with his motorcycle club, the Capitalist Tools — and with actress
Elizabeth Taylor as a passenger!
Today riding motorcycles is chic. And it’s fun to know that, as a motorcyclist,
you have such good company. After all, we can’t all be famous celebrities, but
we can do something that they do. Or, if you look at it backward, famous
celebrities and millionaires want to be like us! So you, too, can be part of the
“in” crowd. All it takes is about a thousand bucks for a used motorcycle.
Riding makes you feel Marlon-Brando cool
A famous poster made from a photograph from the 1954 film The Wild One
shows Marlon Brando sitting on a Triumph motorcycle. (I discuss this movie
in Chapter 2 and in Chapter 21.) He looks soooo cool. In fact, he’s cool through-
out the movie. At one point in the movie, this motorcycling rebel is asked,
“What are you rebelling against, Johnny?” To this he replies, “Whaddya got?”
All of us have a little Johnny in us. Maybe we have to wear a suit and tie when
we go to work; or we need to punch the clock at the factory at a certain time,
eat lunch at a certain time, and punch out at a certain time. We have bosses
at work telling us what to do; we have responsibilities at home we have to
take care of. Maybe we want to rebel against everything, but we can’t. We
can, however, feel like a rebel and feel cool when we ride our motorcycles.
After all, motorcycling isn’t just about motorcycles. Motorcycles are a key
component, of course, but motorcycling, really, is all about how it makes you
feel. And when you put on your black leather jacket, black pants, and motor-
cycling boots and then pull on your gloves and hop on your bike, you can feel
17
Chapter 1: The Allure of Motorcycling: Six Million Motorcyclists Can’t be Wrong

like Johnny in the movie. Go ahead, add a little sneer right after you fire up
your machine and take off down the road. It’s fun, and nobody gets hurt.
Maybe you’re looking for a different kind of cool. Maybe you don’t want to be
a rebel. Maybe you want to be (and be seen as) an adventurer, ready to ride
thousands of miles at a moment’s notice — willing to ride 500 miles just to
have lunch at a cool restaurant. You can do that, and you can have tales from
your adventures to tell anyone who asks.
Admit it, you don’t feel very cool when you hop into the family minivan. But
when you hop on your motorcycle? It conjures up a whole different world in
your head. You can live your fantasy. In fact, on a bike, your fantasy can
become reality. You can feel very, very cool.
Being the envy of friends and strangers
When you take up motorcycling, people look at you in a different light —
especially if you’re the kind of person others wouldn’t expect to ride a motor-
cycle. Based on our own life experiences, we all have our own perceptions of
who a motorcyclist is and what type of person he or she is. Your friends and
family may lecture you, telling you that motorcycles are dangerous and that
you’re too old to be riding a bike. However, the reality is that most of your
friends will be envious and wish they could be motorcyclists, too.
And they have good reason to be envious. Motorcyclists are daring, adventur-
ous types; otherwise they wouldn’t ride motorcycles. They would be happy
just riding around in cages, which is what motorcyclists call cars. Folks who
don’t ride motorcycles are envious for a number of reasons. One is the free-
dom that a motorcyclist has to just hop on his or her bike and ride, searching
for adventure. A motorcyclist doesn’t need a destination. He or she just
needs a bike and some gas money.
Outsiders are also envious of the fun a motorcyclist has riding his or her
machine. Most people have been driving cars for so long that they’re on auto-
matic pilot when they slide into the driver’s seat. Not motorcyclists. On a
motorcycle, they’re hyperaware of what’s going on around them, and they’re
in total control of the machine, making many quick-as-a-thought decisions
during a ride: how to best take this turn, how to avoid that pothole, what gear
to be in, how hard to brake, whether a car might pull out of that driveway.
People may think that just cruising down a country road on a motorcycle
hearing the rumble of the engine, feeling the sun in your face, and smelling
the flowers along the road must make the ride a pleasurable experience. And
they’re right. Or they may imagine the fun you have strafing tight corners on
your high-performance bike; turning left, right, left; going up and down on a
roller-coaster ride in the country. Again, they’re right. And they’re envious.

The bottom line is that friends, and strangers, want to be you. They probably
won’t admit it, but it’s true.
Speaking the unique motorcyclist 
language
Attitude separates motorcyclists from car drivers. Motorcyclists are more
adventurous. They’re willing to step out of their comfort zones and try some-
thing new, and they’re really part of a special group. As part of that special
group, motorcyclists also have their own language, which is some of the fun
of being a motorcyclist. You can talk biker talk with other motorcyclists that
the car drivers don’t understand. Being fellow motorcyclists is like knowing a
foreign language or having a special handshake.
Biker language, of course, evolved out of the need to communicate with other
motorcyclists about certain characteristics of motorcycling. And when talk-
ing about biker language, I’m not just talking about the special words that
motorcyclists use — I’m also talking about what riders talk about. For exam-
ple, motorcyclists talk an awful lot about tires. Do car drivers? Ask one of
your car-driving buds what size tires are on his or her car, or whether they’re
high-performance tires. Your bud probably won’t know.
A motorcyclist, however, will know all sorts of stuff:
 The size of his or her motorcycle tires
 The brand of tire they have
 Whether they’re high-performance tires or tires designed to last a long
time
 Whether they’re radial or bias-ply tires
 How many miles he or she gets out of the tires before they need to be
replaced
Imagine that you hop on your Hog (the trademarked nickname for a big Harley-
Davidson motorcycle), and cruise down to a local restaurant that’s a popular
gathering place for motorcyclists. You park your bike next to a bagger, which
is a big touring machine with saddlebags or luggage. Another motorcyclist
greets you and asks whether you’re a member of the AMA. That motorcyclist
is talking not about the American Medical Association, but about the American
Motorcyclist Association, the largest association of motorcyclists in the world.
In the restaurant, you sit down with other bikers and order a cup of coffee
and a big slice of apple pie. Someone asks you what you’re riding, and you
say “a Hog.” He replies that he’s riding a Duck (Ducati). You then get into a
19
Chapter 1: The Allure of Motorcycling: Six Million Motorcyclists Can’t be Wrong

discussion of your ride to the restaurant. He asks whether you had any prob-
lems on your big machine with the sweepers, which are long, gentle curves or
turns in the road; or with the twisties, which are tight, sharp turns. He then
asks whether you saw a bike on its side just off an off-camber turn (that is, a
turn in which the asphalt tilts down in the opposite direction of the turn). He
says he heard that some rider earlier got into the turn too hot (fast) “and
threw it in the weeds (crashed).”
The discussion then turns to the size of the motor in your bike, the tires, how
far you’ve ridden this riding season, your longest trip, what accessories you
have on your bike, and other fun stuff all related to motorcycling. As a motor-
cyclist, if you aren’t having fun riding your bike, you’re having fun talking
about motorcycling. I cover basic motorcyclist language in Appendix A.
Dressing the part of a motorcyclist
Besides riding and talking about motorcycles, what makes motorcycling fun
is the wide variety of clothes you can wear that are related to the sport. Like
motorcyclists, even nonmotorcyclists like to wear Harley-Davidson and West
Coast Chopper T-shirts. Motorcyclists also like to wear and collect special
shirts, like from the Harley-Davidson shops in areas where they’ve visited, or
shirts that only other motorcyclists recognize.
For example, a motorcyclist may have a T-shirt from the Smiling Skull biker bar
in Athens, Ohio; from Sturgis, South Dakota, which was bought while attending
the mega-motorcycle rally there; and from Pacific Harley-Davidson in Honolulu.
The collection may also include a foxhead shirt made by Fox Racing; a Gary
Nixon Enterprises T-shirt sold by legendary motorcycle racer Gary Nixon; or a
fancy Team Suzuki pit-crew shirt. Besides T-shirts and pit-crew shirts, you can
buy motorcycle-themed Aloha shirts, dress shirts, tank tops, and more.
Motorcyclists always wear a motorcycle-themed T-shirt under their jacket
when they ride. These shirts are part of the culture, and most motorcyclists
have a large collection of motorcycle-related T-shirts. But for protection from
the road when riding — and to look really cool — a motorcyclist needs a
great jacket and other safety gear. Even nonmotorcyclists are dressing the
part of motorcyclists nowadays. And why not? The jackets are so cool.
The great thing is that you can choose from an awful lot of great jackets.
Dressing up for the ride in black or colorful riding gear is part of the fun of
motorcycling. You can dress in a black jacket, black chaps, and black boots
for a bad boy/girl look. You can wear a tight-fitting, colorful jacket and pants
for a professional racer look. Or you can go with synthetic riding gear to have
an adventure-across-Africa look. You can even change your looks, depending
on what bike you ride. Though, you do need to wear the right gear for the
bike you’re riding. Why? To fit in with that subculture of motorcycling. Or, go
ahead, be a rebel — wear whatever you want!
20
Part I: The Mysterious World of Motorcycling 

You want fringe on your jacket? You can get it. You want an orange and
purple jacket? You can get that, too. The fun part of motorcycling clothes is
the look, so have fun with it. But remember, motorcycling clothes serve an
important safety function: They’re made specifically to help protect you in a
crash. I discuss riding gear in detail in Chapter 5.
Racing: Mikey (Michael Jordan) likes it!
Motorcycling is glamorous not only because of the people who ride motorcy-
cles, but also because of the popularity of motorcycle sports even among non-
motorcyclists. The top two motorcycle sports are Supercross and roadracing.
Supercross is racing that takes place in a stadium on a dirt course that features
high jumps, tight turns, and rows of small hills that racers stutter over. These
events are like rock concerts, with bright lights, giant megatron TV screens,
fireworks, and professional riders who are as glamorous and popular, and
almost as highly paid, as rock stars. If you go to any Supercross race around
the country, you’ll find thousands of fans screaming for their favorite riders,
and probably only a small portion of the fans are motorcyclists. Supercross is
great entertainment, something that motorcyclists are proud to be a part of.
Roadracing isn’t actually racing on roads. This racing is exciting professional
racing that occurs on asphalt tracks around the nation. In these races, riders
hit 180 mph or more on their machines, and they ride elbow-to-elbow with
other riders. The riders lean so far over in the tight turns that they scrape the
knees of their leather racing suits, which have special protection. Some
riders lean so far over that they scrape their elbows!
If you attend a professional roadrace, you may see former basketball 
legend Michael Jordan, who has his own racing team called Michael Jordan
Motorsports. He has a two-rider team that races in Superbike and Superstock
classes. Or you may bump into actress Catherine Bell or other celebrities who
enjoy attending the races. With the colorful race team semitrucks, the carnival
atmosphere at the track, and the big money that’s put into professional motor-
cycle roadracing, these events have about all the glamour that you can stand.
Of course, you can find a lot of other motorcycle racing disciplines. But
Supercross and roadracing are the two big glamour sports. I discuss some
can’t-miss races in Chapter 16.
Women in a Man’s World
More women are getting into motorcycling. In fact, an estimated 10 percent of
the motorcyclists on the road today are women. And that’s great. After all,
why should men have all the fun?
21
Chapter 1: The Allure of Motorcycling: Six Million Motorcyclists Can’t be Wrong

Motorcycle manufacturers and safety-gear makers recognize this growing
market and are catering to women in various ways. Bike manufacturers have
special programs to help women learn about motorcycling, and the safety gear
producers are making products specifically for women. Women no longer have
to buy ill-fitting men’s jackets and pants that may not offer all the protection
needed in a crash when the gear moves around upon impact with the asphalt.
Also gone are the days when a female rider had to buy a man’s motorcycling
boot in a small size to be able to stay safe while riding, or when she had very
limited choices in jacket or pants styles. Women today have almost as many
choices as men in jackets, pants, boots, gloves, and helmets. You can even
find them with a feminine look. I discuss women’s styles more in Chapter 6.
Some of the most beautiful women in the world ride motorcycles. For exam-
ple, Catherine Bell, Lauren Hutton, and Angelina Jolie all ride bikes. A woman
doesn’t need to be big, look tough, and have a ton of tattoos to ride a motor-
cycle. And as more women ride motorcycles, more male motorcyclists are
accepting them into the world of motorcycling not as women, but as fellow
motorcyclists.
If guys are cool on bikes, then 
women are supercool
Male motorcyclists get a lot of respect when they have the skills to handle a
motorcycle (which most men don’t have) and when they’re adventurous and
look cool in their riding garb. Even so, they’re men. As such, among motorcy-
clists men are no big deal. Women, on the other hand, are a big deal.
Women who ride are still a minority both among women in general and
among motorcyclists. So for male motorcyclists, and even nonmotorcyclists,
a woman who rides is a dream woman. Why? The perception may not match
the reality, but women riders are seen as adventurous, outgoing, willing to
take risks, and willing to step outside their comfort zones to enjoy life.
Female riders are supercool because they’re strong women who decide to do
something and then do it, who can stand up for themselves, and who can talk
about motorcycling. Plus, they look great in today’s motorcycling clothes cut
specifically for women, with feminine designs. When a female motorcyclist
walks into a restaurant, everyone knows she’s special without her having to
say a word.
And although guys have a great time giving women rides on their motorcycles
and feeling the women hold them around the waist, true male motorcyclists
prefer when women ride their own bikes. Why? The dynamics of a motorcycle
change with a passenger, and a bike is a lot more fun to ride alone.
22
Part I: The Mysterious World of Motorcycling 

Dealing with special gender-related 
problems
Motorcycling is still very much a man’s world, so women do face some prob-
lems. For example, on the whole, motorcycles are still made for men, so most
are simply too big for women. However, motorcycles can be modified to make
them safe for smaller women to ride, so don’t think that you’re forever locked
out of motorcycling because of your size. (I talk about how to make these
modifications in Chapter 6.)
And sometimes gaining acceptance as a motorcyclist by some men can be
tough. But don’t worry about those guys. Plenty of male motorcyclists will
accept you and help you enjoy the joys of motorcycling.
Plus, along with the increase in female riders comes an increase in resources
for them. You can join women’s motorcycling clubs, where women socialize
and ride together. And, today, more Web sites and magazines are geared
specifically for female riders to share their stories and advice. Now truly is a
good time to be a woman in the world of motorcycling.
Even Kids Can Ride
Motorcycling may seem difficult if you’ve never done it. But, really, how hard
can it be? After all, 4-year-olds race motorcycles! Granted, they’re very small
motorcycles . . . and they don’t go very fast . . . and they’re riding in dirt. But,
hey, those are 4-year-old kids riding them!
Talk to any motorcycling family in which the kids ride motorcycles in the dirt
with dad (or even dad and mom) or race at a local track, and you discover a
special bond. The kids are doing something they love, and the parents know
exactly what their kids are up to every weekend because they’re right there
with them riding in the woods or at the racetrack.
How many other activities can you participate in with your kids? Plenty. But
how many can you participate in that your kids actually think is cool? If
you’re a riding family, your kids are the envy of all the other kids on the block
and at school. It’s good, clean, wholesome recreation for the whole family. (I
discuss children and motorcycling in further detail in Chapter 7.)
Getting kids started in motorcycling
It’s great if your child wants to ride a motorcycle. In fact, it’s something to
encourage. After all, it’s a lot better than having your kid hang out at the local
23
Chapter 1: The Allure of Motorcycling: Six Million Motorcyclists Can’t be Wrong

mall. And it’s a safer sport than you think, provided you ensure that your
child has the proper training and safety gear and is well supervised.
Your child may not be old enough to drive a car or ride a streetbike, but he or
she certainly can ride a dirt bike. And there are a lot of good pint-sized bikes
available on the market for them. Safety gear and excellent training also are
available for the youngsters. And while this hobby can be expensive, it also
can be done cheaply if you pick your bike and safety gear wisely. (I discuss
buying a used bike in Chapter 9.)
Riding a dirt bike will make you a better street rider, as I discuss in Chapter 3,
so it will give your child valuable skills if he or she decides to get a streetbike
later.
Kids + motorcycling = fun
Get your child a dirt bike, get one for yourself, get some dirt bike training,
and then head out on the trails and have a ball. Riding with your kid is fun,
and it’s a great way to enjoy being with each other riding at a slow, leisurely
pace. If you ride at your child’s pace, you’ll both stay out of trouble, no
matter how much of a novice rider you are.
Take along some snacks and water or sports drinks to enjoy while stopped
alongside the trail. Chat a little about riding and what’s going on in your
child’s life, and I guarantee you’ll make memories that will last forever.
Keys to Riding Safely
It’s unavoidable. After you start talking about getting a motorcycle, your 
well-meaning family and friends will look at you like you’ve grown a second
head. Then they’ll start telling you tales of people they know who got motor-
cycles and then proceeded to seriously injure or even kill themselves. While
some of the stories may be true, it’s also true that people are killed driving a
car, walking across an intersection, or even playing a sport like football or
baseball.
Sure, motorcycling is dangerous, especially when compared to driving a car.
After all, if a car hits another car, the drivers have a good chance of escaping
serious injury because of the safety features of the car and because the
driver is surrounded by heavy metal to absorb some of the impact. A motor-
cycle rider is much more vulnerable and likely to suffer injury if hit by
another vehicle.
24
Part I: The Mysterious World of Motorcycling 

But motorcyclists have some big advantages over drivers of other vehicles
when it comes to safety. For example, a motorcyclist on a nimble bike can
accelerate out of the way of trouble or stop more quickly than a car or truck
driver can to avoid a collision. And motorcyclists spend a lot of time practic-
ing safe riding techniques to ensure their survival on the road.
Enrolling in basic training 
for motorcyclists
Although there’s no boot camp for aspiring motorcyclists, there are great
beginner motorcycle safety training classes run by friendly instructors. These
classes are available to anyone with the desire to learn how to ride a bike and
the tuition money to plunk down. This basic training is a great way for
anyone interested in motorcycling to learn a couple things:
 Whether they would enjoy riding a motorcycle, since the class gives a
taste of what the experience is like.
 Whether they even have the coordination needed to ride a motorcycle.
Some people don’t.
More importantly, though, basic rider training classes teach new riders how
to be safe while riding their motorcycles. They do so not only by teaching
basic riding techniques such as accelerating, stopping, turning, and swerv-
ing, but also by teaching what dangers to watch for while riding, such as a
car making a left turn and pulling into a rider’s path or a car merging into the
rider’s lane on the freeway. I discuss getting the best motorcycle safety train-
ing on the planet in Chapter 3.
Developing special riding skills
Besides basic training, motorcyclists have the opportunity to take advanced
training and to attend classes held at racetracks to hone their accelerating,
braking, and cornering skills. And all the skills they learn in basic classes,
advanced classes, or even on the racetrack, they practice every day when
they ride their motorcycles.
Motorcyclists know that practice is the key to using important skills, such as
braking and swerving, without having to give the technique any thought. They
see every curve as a challenge to determine whether it can be negotiated with
perfect technique. Every stop sign is an opportunity to practice smooth stops
and starts, and every empty parking lot presents an opportunity to practice
slow, tight turns. (I discuss safe riding techniques in Chapters 14 and 15.)

M
otorcycling has a long, rich history that runs from the late 1800s to
today. And that history has almost as many twists and turns as your
favorite mountain road. From the first motorcycle — which was either simply
a wooden testbed for a motor or a steam-powered bicycle, depending on
which side of the debate you’re on — to the hyperbikes of today that are so
fast that some governments have even threatened to limit their speed, the
world of motorcycling has gone through a lot of changes.
Some motorcyclists consider the very early days of the motorcycle as the
glory years: You had to be a good rider and a good mechanic to navigate your
machine over the rough dirt paths that were back then known as roads. Men
raced motorcycles on giant, banked board tracks that could pierce a rider
with foot-long slivers if he fell. And hundreds of separate motorcycle manu-
facturers built bikes in the United States.
Others argue that the late 1950s through the 1960s were the best days of motor-
cycling. The European manufacturers were selling their motorcycles in the
United States, and motorcyclists spoke fondly of their Triumphs, Matchlesses,
and BSAs. Then the Japanese manufacturers decided to take on the Europeans
head-on in the U.S. market, bringing with them a notable advertising campaign
that made motorcycling acceptable to Americans. Finally, the chopper craze hit,
leading to some of the most stunning custom machines to ever explore the
nation’s highways and byways — at least, up until then.
You can easily romanticize the past, but the glory days of motorcycling are
right now. Some 6 million motorcyclists share a passion for this timeless
sport. Bikers today ride a wide variety of reliable, state-of-the-art machines;
they watch the fastest racers ever to throw a leg over a motorcycle seat; and

they buy the most innovative and protective motorcycling gear ever pro-
duced. If ever there was a great time to get into motorcycling, it is now.
In this chapter, you explore the beginnings of motorcycling, examine the motor-
cycle’s explosion in popularity and fall from favor, discover how British and
Japanese machines influenced American riders and the public, and consider
how Americans’ attitudes toward motorcyclists have changed over the years.
The Rise and Fall of American
Motorcycling
Soon after the first motorcycles appeared in the late 1800s and early 1900s,
people began to buy them. Early motorcycles were little more than bicycles
with motors, but to many, it beat riding a horse or riding in a horse-pulled
buggy to get around. Motorcycles were transportation, pure and simple.
Bicycle racing was a great form of entertainment back then, so it wasn’t long
before motorcycles were on the racetracks providing entertainment of their
own. The factories put efforts into racing with hopes of boosting sales, and
some of the hardy racers of the time became legends; their exploits were
noted in the newspapers of the day.
But then motorcycles fell out of favor with the American public, primarily
due to the cheap production of automobiles. Motorcycle racers were no
longer the heroes they once had been. Almost all American motorcycle manu-
facturers went out of business; only war and the production of motorcycles
for the military kept the biggest manufacturers alive.
The Europeans (particularly the British) and then the Japanese saw great
market potential in the United States and took advantage of it, producing
machines that Americans would buy. Ultimately, the Europeans couldn’t com-
pete with the Japanese in terms of quality and price, and today Japanese
machines dominate the U.S. market. The Harley-Davidson Motor Company is
the only surviving American motorcycle company from those early days,
when as many as 300 American motorcycle manufacturers may have been
producing bikes.
The golden age: 300 American 
motorcycle manufacturers
In the early 1900s, the internal combustion engine had been perfected and 
as many as 300 motorcycle manufacturers may have been operating in the

Chapter 2: From the First Wooden Horse to Today’s Iron Pony
Gottlieb vs. Roper smackdown: 
Who built the first motorcycle?
When it comes to determining who created the
first motorcycle, only two contenders emerge:
Gottlieb Daimler and Sylvester Roper. It may be
easy to say, “Well, which was built first? Then
that, surely, is the first motorcycle.” Well, things
are a lot more complicated than that. The first
motorcycle was built more than 100 years ago,
yet debate over who built it still makes for lively
conversation among motorcyclists who know a
bit of the history.
Born in 1834 in Germany, Daimler was an engi-
neer and industrial designer. In 1872, he worked
for a company that made engines (primarily
steam) that powered equipment. But he wanted
a new motor and something that could propel a
vehicle, like a stagecoach. Daimler teamed up
with another inventor and industrial designer,
Wilhelm Maybach, who worked at the same
company, to try to realize this dream. They
needed a good gas-powered motor for their
experiments, and they found one created by
Nikolaus Otto, one of the owners of the com-
pany that Daimler and Maybach worked for.
While perfecting the Otto motor, Daimler put
one into a wooden, two-wheeled bicycle-like
frame in 1885. The invention worked. Daimler
went on to put an Otto motor in a stagecoach,
and, in 1899, Daimler and Maybach built a car.
Daimler, by the way, is the name in the modern
company name Daimler-Chrysler.
So was the Daimler motorcycle really just a test
platform for the Otto motor? Or was it, in fact,
meant to be a motorcycle and it was a fanciful
idea that became reality for Daimler and
Maybach, who wanted to create propelled
transportation? Also, were they just a step
ahead of their time, which explains why their
motorcycle-like invention never caught on with
companies that would take a chance building it
or the public that would take a chance buying
it? These questions all figure into the debate
over whether the Daimler machine can truly
claim the title as the world’s first motorcycle.
In the other corner, we have a man who set out
to create a motorcycle: Roper. Born in 1823 in
New Hampshire, Roper was a machinist and
inventor. He attached a steam engine to a bicycle
in 1869 to create a steam-powered motorcycle
that he showed off at county fairs. He tried to get
bicycle companies interested in his invention, but
he didn’t have much success. However, he didn’t
give up and kept improving on his invention, even
when the internal combustion engine came on
the scene. He built a total of ten machines.
In 1896, he took his latest machine to a bicycle
racetrack to see if it could be used as a pace-
setter for the bicycles. But while riding around
the track, he crashed and died. Authorities
determined later that he died of a heart attack,
not from the crash. He was 72.
Since Roper’s machine was steam powered, some
argue that it wasn’t the first motorcycle. Others
argue that since the Daimler machine had two out-
rigger “training” wheels, it, in fact, had four wheels
and couldn’t be considered a motorcycle. What is
certain is that the Daimler machine was the first
internal combustion motorcycle, and the Roper
was the first steam-powered motorcycle.
So then, what was the first production motor-
cycle? Many argue it is the Hildebrand and
Wolfmuller. German brothers Heinrich and
Wilhelm Hildebrand in the late 1800s had a
dream to build a motorcycle, and teamed up with
motor-builder Alois Wolfmuller. The result was
the Hildebrand and Wolfmuller, a 1,498cc, gas-
powered motorcycle built for sale to the public.
Like all early motorcycles, it was basically a bicy-
cle with a motor stuck on it. In three years they
produced about 800 machines, but handling and
starting problems with the bikes outraged cus-
tomers, and the company went out of business.

United States alone (although others put the estimate at a little more than
50). How many of these actually produced motorcycles each year, or even
survived a year, is unknown. But some famous American motorcycle manu-
facturers got their start during this time, including the Indian Motorcycle
Company, the Harley-Davidson Motor Company, and Excelsior, later known as
Excelsior-Henderson.
Why were motorcycles so popular in the early 1900s? The buying public
wanted cheap transportation. In 1909, a standard Ford Model T car cost $850,
or about a year’s wages. The price for a 1909 Harley-Davidson? $325.
Indian Motorcycle Company
Indian actually began as the Hendee Manufacturing Company. George Hendee
and Oscar Hendstrom teamed up to create Indian motorcycles. The first was
built in 1901 and sold in 1902. Basically, they just stuck a motor on a bicycle
frame, which is what everyone else was doing. However, the Indian proved to
be relatively popular among the buying public. Hendee and Hendstrom sold
143 motorcycles that year; by 1913 they were producing a variety of models
and selling 32,000.
Harley-Davidson Motor Company
The story of the Harley-Davidson Motor Company starting life in a 10-foot-by-
15-foot shed in Milwaukee in 1903 is well known. What’s not as well known is
how few motorcycles were actually built in that shed: 1 prototype and 13 bikes.
But those models were enough to convince the Harley brothers — William,
Walter, and Arthur — and William Davidson, the company founders, to move to
a 2,400-square-foot facility. In 1913, the company sold 13,000 motorcycles.
Excelsior
Excelsior built its first motorcycles in Chicago in 1905. In 1911, the Schwinn
Company bought Excelsior to get into the motorcycle business. Meanwhile,
the Henderson Company in Detroit began producing motorcycles in 1912.
Excelsior bought out Henderson in 1917. At its high point, the company made
only about 1,800 machines a year.
The demise of American motorcycling:
Curse you, Mr. Ford!
With so many motorcycle manufacturers in the early days, the companies
decided they needed to get into racing as a sales tool, primarily to prove the
reliability of their machines. The racetrack battles between the Indian and
Harley-Davidson factory riders in the 1910s and later were legendary. Harley-
Davidson and Indian were later able to survive during the lean World War I
30
Part I: The Mysterious World of Motorcycling 

years with military contracts. Indian sold the military about 50,000 machines,
and Harley-Davidson sold about 20,000 from 1917 to 1919.
During those years, Indian sold no motorcycles to the public, and Harley-
Davidson sold few. Many other American motorcycling companies that were
struggling didn’t survive the war years. Why were they all struggling and
eventually going out of business? You can thank Mr. Henry Ford.
Although a lot of motorcyclists today buy a motorcycle for cheap transporta-
tion, most buy a motorcycle for recreation. They just want to have fun. That
wasn’t true back in the day. In the early 1900s, people wanted to get around
and needed cheap transportation to do it. A motorcycle fit the bill, with a
cost of $125 to $325 or so, depending on the model. That was at a time when
cars cost as much as $2,000 or $3,000, and even Ford’s cheap Model T was
$850 in 1909.
But Ford was making a lot of cars. And he was learning a lot about how to
produce cars cheaply. With his high volume and assembly-line innovations,
he was able to cut the price of his cars over the years. The Model T went
from $850 in 1909 to $440 in 1915. Suddenly, the Model T was within reach of
the average American family. Ford built about 15 million Model Ts between
1909 and 1927. In 1927, a Ford Model T touring car cost $380. So a family
could buy a motorcycle or, for a little more, buy a car. Most opted for a car.
So by 1930, only two major American motorcycle manufacturers were left:
Indian and Harley-Davidson.
And then there was one: Harley-Davidson
Indian and Harley continued their epic racetrack battles to boost sales and,
during the years of World War II (1941–1945), sold bikes to the military.
Harley-Davidson produced 90,000 military machines, while Indian sold 35,000
for war use.
After the war, Indian still sold its big Chief but also began producing smaller
machines, hoping to compete with small, agile British imports. It couldn’t. A
combination of factors led to the demise of the Indian Motocycle Company in
1953, including bad management and stiff competition from Harley-Davidson.
Harley-Davidson was the lone American motorcycle manufacturer after 1953.
But British imports were cutting into Harley-Davidson sales. By the late 1960s,
Harley-Davidson was owned by American Machinery and Foundry (AMF), the
bowling machine–making company, and suffered from a reputation of building
very poor-quality machines. In 1981, a group of employees, including Willie G.
Davidson, grandson of one of the company founders, bought the company,
improved production, and made it a success.

Motorcycling’s Popularity Rises Again
In motorcycling’s early days, motorcycles were wildly popular because they
were cheap transportation. They became popular again in the 1950s because
they were fun to ride and people could afford them as recreational vehicles in
the post–World War II boom years. Dominating the American market at the
time were primarily British machines from companies with names like
Triumph, BSA, and Norton.
The machines were smaller, lighter, and faster than Harley-Davidsons. By the
late 1950s, British machines were everywhere, from the racetrack to Main
Street. Harley-Davidson knew it had to improve its performance image to sur-
vive the British onslaught, so in 1957, it unveiled its secret weapon: the XL
Sportster. Powered by a motor with 54 cubic inches of displacement (883cc),
the Sportster was relatively quick and light, and shouted performance.
The British came into the market with lighter and faster machines than
Harley-Davidson was selling and gained popularity among U.S. riders. The
Japanese followed by offering bikes that were lighter, faster, and more reliable
than the British machines.
Honda backed up its move into the United States with a genius advertising
campaign meant to show that motorcycles were fun. The slogan is probably
the most recognizable slogan in all of motorcycling: “You Meet the Nicest
People on a Honda.” And with that slogan, Honda captured the imagination of

Part I: The Mysterious World of Motorcycling 
Salute to the Sportster
The Sportster has remained incredibly popular
over the years. You can still walk into a Harley-
Davidson dealership today, more than 50 years
after the first Sportster was built, and buy a new
one. The initial XL didn’t sell very well, but
Harley-Davidson quickly redesigned the bike to
give it a small peanut-shaped gas tank, stag-
gered exhaust pipes, and a minimalist look that
captured the attention of American buyers. This
bike was designated the XLH. It received minor
updates over the years and then a performance
boost in 1966 and again in 1972, when the
engine displacement was increased to 1,000cc.
Variations of the machine were built, including a
touring model. Then in 1986, the Sportster got a
new motor, called the Evolution. Even more
changes have been made since then, and the
bike is now available with engine displacements
of 883cc and 1,200cc. But the Sportster has
remained true to its original mission of being an
affordable performance machine, particularly
for those who want to get into motorcycling and
who want a Harley-Davidson. On the other
hand, the Sportster, particularly the 883, has the
reputation of being “the girl’s Harley” because
this model is so popular among female riders.

the American public and introduced them to their smaller-bore, unintimidat-
ing machines.
The campaign used a small Honda 50 step-through scooter as its centerpiece
and showed moms and young couples smiling and riding the machine. The
campaign was wildly successful and boosted Honda sales significantly. By
1963, Honda was selling about 200,000 machines a year in the United States.
The Japanese, led by Honda, continued to make inroads into the U.S. market
through the 1960s. The British, unable to compete, eventually died out in the
early 1970s (although Triumph has since been reborn). In contrast, by 1970,
Honda alone was selling 500,000 motorcycles a year in the United States. Its
flagship was the CB750, introduced in 1969. This bike was considered well
built and sophisticated, and was relatively cheap, at $1,495. Motorcyclists
from the 1970s fondly remember it as a high-performance streetbike.
The Japanese motorcycle manufacturers — Honda, Kawasaki, Suzuki, and
Yamaha — dominate the American market today. Harley-Davidson is still
going strong, particularly with good overseas sales. A variety of motorcycles
from Europe — BMW, Ducati, Moto Guzzi, Triumph, and others — also are
available in the United States, although their sales figures are dwarfed by
those of the Japanese manufacturers and Harley-Davidson.
Changing Attitudes Toward Motorcyclists
Americans’ attitudes toward motorcyclists have fluctuated from acceptance
in the early years to disdain following World War II, to acceptance again in the
1960s, to the popularity and acceptance of today.
Why is the American public so fickle? What caused attitudes to fluctuate so
dramatically over the years? Simply put, it was the media. Newspapers, maga-
zines, and movies played a major role in shaping public opinion, and despite
the best efforts of motorcycling organizations such as the then-small but feisty
American Motorcyclist Association to counter negative press, motorcyclists
have been portrayed at some points over the years as hoodlums or outlaws.
Although motorcyclists are generally accepted today, riders who have loud
exhaust systems are causing a public backlash against all motorcyclists.
Citizens are asking their lawmakers to do something about the noise. The
problem has become so serious that major motorcycling organizations and
even Harley-Davidson are asking riders to be responsible. In other words,
they want them to pipe down.
33
Chapter 2: From the First Wooden Horse to Today’s Iron Pony

How the media and Hollywood 
have shaped public opinion
From the first days of motorcycling in America through World War II, motor-
cycles were primarily viewed as transportation. The general public accepted
motorcyclists. All that changed following the war.
Restless World War II vets formed motorcycle clubs and rode around together,
sharing the camaraderie of motorcycling. Other clubs included nonvets as
well, of course; the vet-dominated clubs were more free-wheeling and less
likely to follow rules, though. For example, most motorcycle clubs associated
themselves with the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA), took part in
AMA-sanctioned rides, and competed for things such as AMA Safety Awards
for safe riding. Many vet clubs had none of that.
Even long before World War II, the AMA sanctioned gypsy tours, which were
(and still are) organized rides to a specific destination. Gypsy tours allowed
riders to gather for a long ride and then to enjoy themselves at the destina-
tion for a day or two before heading home. Probably the most famous gypsy
tour in American motorcycling history, and certainly the most significant for
the reputation of motorcyclists, was the one that ended in Hollister,
California, on the 4th of July weekend in 1947.
An estimated 4,000 motorcyclists descended on Hollister for the gypsy tour.
Admittedly, some of the motorcyclists who ended up in Hollister as part of
the Gypsy Tour got a little out of hand, drinking excessively, riding their bikes
into bars, and, shall we say, putting on “exhibitions of speed” in the streets.
What happened next, though, turned the American public against the
American motorcyclist.
A picture is worth a thousand words
The San Francisco Chronicle reported on the Hollister Gypsy Tour, saying that
motorcyclists had wreaked havoc in the town and forced police to impose an
informal martial law. Life magazine, a popular news magazine of the day that
was heavy on photographs, ran a staged photograph in 1947 of a motorcy-
clist in Hollister leaning back on his motorcycle seat and drinking a beer.
About two dozen empty beer bottles littered the street beneath his bike. No
story accompanied the photograph. The photograph carried a simple caption
stating that this motorcyclist and his buddies had terrorized a town.
How do we know the famous photograph was staged? Simple. In the photo-
graph is a bearded man in the background standing on the sidewalk. He later
said the photo was staged. But it didn’t matter. Because of the Life magazine
photograph and caption, suddenly mainstream America feared motorcycle
gangs and motorcyclists.
34
Part I: The Mysterious World of Motorcycling 

The movies: Bigger than Life (magazine)
For Hollywood, the so-called Hollister riot had everything needed for a great
movie. Well, not everything. It still needed a love interest. But, hey, Hollywood
could just add that to the script, along with whatever else was needed to get
people into the drive-ins and movie theaters. In 1954, Hollywood released a
movie loosely based on the reported events in Hollister. This movie, called
The Wild One, was directed by Laszlo Benedek, produced by Stanley Kramer,
and distributed by Columbia Pictures Corp.
The movie portrayed motorcyclists as young punks ready to terrorize a town
and rebelling against, well, everything. It also marked the beginning of a trend
of motorcycle gang movies that lasted for about 15 years and did nothing to
enhance the reputation of motorcyclists in the minds of the American public.
Fortunately, in the early 1960s, Honda launched its now-famous “You Meet
the Nicest People on a Honda” advertising campaign and helped offset some
of the negativity toward motorcyclists that the movies spawned.
Then in 1969, the movie Easy Rider helped show that motorcyclists aren’t just
hoodlums. In that movie, Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper set off to discover
the United States on motorcycles. (You can read more about these movies in
Chapter 21.)
When motorcycling became chic
In the 1970s and 1980s, motorcycling and motorcyclists became acceptable
again, thanks in part to people like millionaire publisher Malcolm Forbes.
Forbes became a motorcyclist in the late 1960s, and the news media followed
his global motorcycling travels that he took with his club, the Capitalist
Tools. He was often photographed with actress Elizabeth Taylor riding as his

The dubious “1-percenter”
Members of outlaw motorcycle clubs that may
be on the wrong side of the law at times like 
to refer to themselves as 1 percenters. These
clubs are called outlaws not because the mem-
bers are criminals, but simply because they
aren’t associated, or chartered, with the
American Motorcyclist Association (AMA). The
club members have adopted the 1 percenter
moniker, and even wear patches on their jackets
or vests that say “1%.” According to popular
motorcycling lore, after the so-called Hollister
riot, an AMA official, in an attempt at spin con-
trol, allegedly said that 99 percent of all motor-
cyclists are law-abiding citizens and only 1
percent are troublemakers. The AMA has been
unable to confirm that an AMA official ever
made such a statement, but the 1-percenter
moniker has stuck.

passenger. Americans saw that the rich and powerful rode motorcycles, so
maybe motorcyclists weren’t so bad after all.
In the 1990s and through to the present, riding a motorcycle has seemed
cool. Famous actors and actresses, like Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, Tom Cruise,
and George Clooney, ride motorcycles. So do doctors, lawyers, dentists, and
politicians. Television shows related to motorcycling have even become pop-
ular among nonmotorcyclists, including American Chopper, featuring the bat-
tling Teutul family, and Biker Build-off.
What motorcycling is like today
With an estimated 6 million motorcyclists across the country today, you
don’t have to look far to see a motorcycle on the street. And despite the long
and rich history of motorcycling, never has there been a better time to be a
motorcyclist. Why? Consider the following:
 Choices in motorcycles are varied, and the bikes are extremely reliable
 The safety gear is the best it has ever been
 More women are getting into the sport
 Motorcycle safety training is better than ever
 The American public generally doesn’t look at motorcyclists with distain
In fact, motorcyclists who make up the various subgroups of motorcycling are
more accepting of the other subgroups than they have ever been. Now, more
than ever, motorcyclists believe that it doesn’t matter what type of motorcy-
cle you ride — what matters is that you ride a motorcycle. That commonality
is good enough to form a bond.
Nowadays, if they want to do so, getting your kids involved in motorcycling is
easier, too. You can find organized kids’ dirt rides, motorcycle safety training
for the young set, and a lot of great safety gear made in pint sizes.
Plus, you can join international, national, and local clubs to help you get the
most fun and excitement you can out of motorcycling. Enjoy the ride.

M
otorcycles are complex machines compared to cars. In fact, they
require a lot of skill to ride at all, let alone ride well. Consider a car, 
for example: you hop in, start it up, press on the accelerator to go, turn the
steering wheel to steer, and press on the brake to stop. Simple. Not so with a
motorcycle. With a bike, you’ve got a clutch lever on the left handlebar, a
front brake lever on the right handlebar, a gear-shift lever that you manipu-
late with your left foot, and a rear-brake lever that you press with your right
foot. And that’s just the stuff on the bike. You also have to worry about 
turning the handlebars and leaning the motorcycle to steer, and you always
have to stay balanced.
Sound complicated? It is. A lot goes on while you’re riding a motorcycle, not
only in your own actions to control the machine but also in the environment
around you. Your environment can distract you and pose a real danger if you
aren’t paying close attention.
Pilots who ride motorcycles say that riding is the closest experience there is
to flying. And as you know, pilots go through a lot of training to be able to fly
their complex jet fighters. Similarly, motorcyclists need a lot of training to
operate their complex machines.

In this chapter, you find out why it’s a bad idea to let a friend teach you how
to ride a motorcycle (no matter how long he or she has been riding). You also
discover how the recognized experts teach newbies to ride, including the
important lessons that students learn. I provide everything you need to know
for when you visit your local department or bureau of motor vehicles to get
your motorcycle license. Plus, I provide the facts that ensure that you have
the skills needed to safely ride, and enjoy, your motorcycle.
If a Friend Offers to Teach 
You, Just Say No
Your motorcycling friend or friends will probably be excited when they find
out that you want to learn how to ride. And, with the best intentions, they
may even offer to teach you. Even if he or she is a certified instructor, it’s not
a good idea to learn from a friend.
Why? Well, it takes a special kind of person to be a good teacher. A good
teacher is extremely patient, explains things in simple terms that anyone 
can grasp, understands the subject matter extremely well, and knows that
each student must be taught at his or her own pace. A friend may not have
that combination of knowledge and skills to be able to teach you.
Plus, a good motorcycling teacher is up on the latest research — not only on
the best riding techniques, but also on how motorcycle crashes occur and
how to avoid them. Unless I’m hanging out with the wrong crowd, there aren’t
very many motorcyclists who know the findings of the latest research. In fact,
there aren’t very many motorcyclists who know much about the findings of
any motorcycle-related research.
For example, do you know that the most common car versus motorcycle
crash is when a car makes a left turn in front of an approaching motorcycle?
Or that you can just about cut your reaction time in half when you need to
make a quick stop on your motorcycle simply by resting your right-hand 
fingers on your front brake lever and left-hand fingers on your clutch? You 
do now. And that means you know more than many of the motorcyclists on
the road today.
That’s the kind of stuff you learn in a safety class that you probably won’t
learn from your friend who tries to teach you how to ride a bike. And besides
not giving you all the information you need to make you the best rider 
possible, your friend may even give you wrong information. For instance,
your friend may tell you to ignore the front brake because it will flip you up
over the handlebars if you use it. That advice is ludicrous. Most of your 
stopping power comes from the front brake, so you need that power when
you make a quick stop. I cover quick stops in Chapter 14.
38
Part I: The Mysterious World of Motorcycling 

Even worse is the fact that you still see newspaper reports where motorcy-
clists say they had to “lay the bike down” to avoid a crash. But, wait a minute,
laying a bike down while you’re riding along is a crash! You certainly don’t
want a friend to teach you how to lay a bike down to avoid hitting something.
Another problem with having a friend teach you how to ride is that you may
pick up his or her bad habits, such as:
 Not using enough fingers on the front brake
 Looking just ahead of your front tire instead of down the road
 Not turning your head far enough when you turn or ride through 
a curve or corner
 Putting your bike in neutral at a stoplight or stop sign
 Riding in the wrong part of the traffic lane
Your friend teaches you how to do things because that’s the way he or she
does it (even though it may not be the safest way to ride).
Another consideration is what happens if you get hurt while your friend is
teaching you how to ride? Or what if you destroy the motorcycle that he or
she is letting you learn on? Getting hurt or wrecking your friend’s bike could
put a real damper on your friendship. An organized class, on the other hand,
is prepared to handle any medical emergencies and destroyed motorcycles.
Training with the Pros: MSF Courses
The Motorcycle Safety Foundation, known as the MSF, is the recognized leader
in motorcycle safety training. It’s a national, nonprofit organization spon-
sored by the major motorcycle manufacturers. The MSF has been providing
training nationwide since the early 1970s, so its trainers know an awful lot
about how to teach motorcycle safety. The foundation has also come to know
how students learn best.
In fact, MSF training is so highly regarded that most states allow new riders
to forego taking a riding skills test to get a motorcycle license if they have
already passed an MSF course. So if you want the best motorcycle safety
training in America (and probably on the planet), take an MSF class.
The MSF offers basic streetbike classes for people who have never been on a
bike before and who want to see if they would enjoy motorcycling. It also
offers classes for those who have already decided that they want to become
motorcyclists. Plus, the MSF offers classes for experienced riders to brush up
on their skills. The foundation offers a class for those who want to learn how
to ride dirt bikes as well.
39
Chapter 3: You Wouldn’t Fly a Jet Without Training, Would You?

The MSF’s mission with these training courses is to reduce motorcycling
fatalities and injuries in the United States. Not only does the MSF provide
rider training, but it also hosts international motorcycle safety conventions
and helps fund motorcycling safety research.
In the motorcycling community, you gain respect from fellow riders if you’ve
taken an MSF course. You gain even more respect if you take the basic course
and then, later, the experienced rider course. And when you do take the expe-
rienced class, don’t be surprised if lined up next to you on the riding range is
a professional rider like a motojournalist. Some of these professionals take
the experienced class every three years to brush up on their skills and stay
sharp.
Another advantage to taking an MSF class is that many insurance companies
give you a discount on your insurance if you prove that you have completed
an MSF course within the past few years.
To find an MSF class near you, go to www.msf-usa.org. Sign up early
because classes fill up fast, probably because people would rather pass 
the class than take the riding skills test in front of the police officers or 
government workers who give the tests. Plus, prospective, and even 
experienced, riders want the best training available.
If you can’t get into an MSF class, you can still take the Rider’s Edge safety
course taught through Harley-Davidson dealerships or take other private
lessons. However, it’s unlikely that your state will accept those forms of 
training in lieu of passing an MSF course, which means that you’re still
required to take the riding skills test.
Motorcycle safety training classes aren’t free, but they’re well worth the
price. Just think of them as part of the price of admission into the wonderful
world of motorcycling. Prices can range from $60 to $100 or more.
Basic training: “This is a clutch, 
this is a brake . . .”
You should have absolutely no fear going into a beginner, or basic, motorcy-
cle safety training class. After all, they are geared for, well, beginners. 
What does that mean? It means that the class begins with very basic terms
and concepts and advances from there until you’re out on the range 
actually riding one of the class motorcycles, which are small, easy-to-handle
machines. You may be able to borrow a helmet from the class, but it’s best 
to bring your own helmet, eye protection, and gloves.
40
Part I: The Mysterious World of Motorcycling 

To take a basic motorcycle riding class your state will probably require you
to have a temporary instructional motorcycle permit. I explain how to get
one later in this chapter.
What the basic course covers
It may seem silly, but a beginning class will start with basics such as dis-
cussing the difference between a car and a motorcycle. Almost every new
rider has experience with cars (and not with motorcycles), so you have to
begin thinking in different terms, such as how riding a motorcycle is different
from driving a car.
A basic course also covers the following types of information:
 Protective gear, including helmets
 Managing risk on the road
 Avoiding crashes
 Inspecting your motorcycle before you go for a ride
 The different controls on a motorcycle, such as the clutch and 
brake levers
In addition, the class covers techniques for handling roadway obstructions
and explains what to do if one of your tires skids, how alcohol affects your
ability to ride, how to get a motorcycle license in your state, and more.
What happens on the riding range
The classroom instruction is interesting, but the real fun stuff happens out 
on the riding range, which is usually a parking lot where cones have been set
up to run motorcycle riding drills. This is where students often get a little
nervous, especially if they see someone drop a bike. But remember that the
instructors are usually pretty kind and really do want you to learn how to
ride. Don’t think of them as drill instructors; think of them as a coach of your
favorite sport.
On the riding range, the instructors first take time to go over the motorcycle
and teach the controls and how to use them. You find out things such as how
to find neutral, how to start and stop the bike, and how to use the throttle
and shift. And that’s all pretty much before even starting up the bike.
The basic class can be pretty slow going because you’re learning from
scratch. The first time on the riding range, your instructor will have you 
do straight-line drills that involve going very slowly so you get the feel for
operating the throttle and clutch. In fact, you start out sitting on the bike and
basically walking it under power. Really, this stuff shouldn’t intimidate you.
41
Chapter 3: You Wouldn’t Fly a Jet Without Training, Would You?

Next you’ll likely learn how to start, stop, and turn, which involves coordinat-
ing the throttle, clutch, and brake. Once you get the hang of those topics, 
you learn how to shift while moving. Then you learn other stuff like speeding
up and slowing down, weaving around cones, stopping quickly, and making 
S- and U-turns.
But wait, there’s more! You also learn how to properly lean a motorcycle,
negotiate corners and curves, change lanes, and avoid hazards. You have a
lot to learn, but every motorcyclist needs to master these basic skills.
Experienced rider training: 
Brushing up on key skills
The class for experienced riders forces students to think about riding and 
the dangers related to riding. It also allows them to brush up on their riding
techniques. The class covers the basics, including what to inspect on your
machine before you go for a ride and what protective gear to wear.
Students discuss risks involved in riding motorcycles and how to avoid those
risks. A lot of time is spent on stopping distance and the affects of aging on a
motorcyclist, such as slower reaction times.
The causes of crashes, both car versus motorcycle and motorcycle only, are
analyzed. Students learn that most motorcyclists crash because they don’t
stop, swerve, or corner properly. The classroom talk also covers more eso-
teric subjects, such as how suspension works and how to maximize traction.
Of course, the coach will also engage a discussion on drinking and riding.
After the classroom portion is over, it’s out to the riding range where riders
practice stopping, swerving, and cornering. When practicing on the range,
these advanced riders are thinking about more than just technique, though.
They’re also analyzing things like how the suspension works or how much
traction there is.
The coaches will try to spot bad habits and help riders correct them. For
instance, they’ll notice if you’re looking down at the road when you corner
rather than looking through the corner and to where you want to go.
It’s good to brush up on your skills by taking the experienced class every
three years.
42
Part I: The Mysterious World of Motorcycling 

Doin’ it in the dirt to be 
a better street rider
If you want to improve your ability to ride your streetbike, take a dirt bike
class. Even better, take a dirt bike class and then get a dirt bike and do a lot
of trail riding. How can riding a dirt bike make you a better street rider? You’ll
encounter certain situations in the dirt that you also encounter on the street.
In fact, the situation you encounter in the dirt will usually be more intense
than the same one on the street. However, you’re usually going slower in the
dirt than you would be on the street, so there’s less danger to you.
For example, if you ride in the dirt, especially after a rain, you’ll often experi-
ence a front or rear wheel loss of traction and sliding. Or you may need to
avoid an obstacle in the trail, such as a rock, but will have little room to do it
because of trees on the side of the trail. You probably won’t have to avoid 
a big rock on the street, but you’ll likely have to avoid tire treads that have
ripped off a truck tire or some other obstacle.
If you’re used to the rear wheel sliding around on your dirt bike, then when
you have to deal with that situation on your streetbike (if you hit gravel on
the road, for example), you’ll be better prepared. And if you’re accustomed 
to getting around obstacles in tight spaces on the trail, doing the same on the
street will be a snap.
Riding in the dirt also requires you to develop a good sense of throttle con-
trol and of tire traction. Otherwise you end up getting a ground-up view of 
the riding area. This ability to feel the traction of your tires obviously trans-
lates to the street as well. Other skills that relate to both streetbikes and dirt
bikes include looking far down the trail (or down the street) and not fixating
on targets, such as a rock on the trail or obstruction on the street. After all, 
if you look at something on the trail or in the street, you’re going to hit it.
The MSF dirt bike class is for beginning dirt riders, and much of what a 
student learns is similar to what is taught in the basic streetbike class: They
learn where the clutch and brake are, how to start the bike, what safety gear
is necessary, and what to inspect on your bike before you go for a ride.
But the classroom portion of the dirt bike class also covers areas not covered
in a street course, such as respect for the land and for other recreational
users of the land, such as horseback riders and campers. After the classroom
discussions are finished, it’s time to hit the riding range.
This time, though, students aren’t in a parking lot with cones. They’re riding
in the dirt. Like in the basic streetbike course, the dirt bike class begins with
the basics, including how to start and stop the bike and walking the bike
around under power to get a feel for how to use the clutch.
43
Chapter 3: You Wouldn’t Fly a Jet Without Training, Would You?

Next the students are riding around in circles, doing figure eights and riding
over obstacles. Riding over obstacles is a skill that can translate to the street,
because there may be times when you just can’t avoid that tire tread in the
road or that squirrel that darted out from nowhere.
In the dirt bike class, you ride up and down hills and tackle other challenges.
It really is a lot of fun. The school provides everything from the bikes to the
safety gear. Price? Around $75 or so.
Going Through the Process 
of Getting Licensed
The first step to getting on the road as a motorcyclist is obtaining a motorcy-
cle license. And the first step in obtaining a motorcycle license is getting a
temporary instructional motorcycle permit. It’s easy to get and is usually
good for six months to a year. (In fact, it’s so easy to get that some motorcy-
clists get the permit and then, when it expires, get it renewed or get another
one to avoid taking the required riding test! However, I don’t recommend 
that route.)
In this section, I give you the lowdown on obtaining your learner’s permit,
knowing what to do once you have it, and eventually passing the test to get
your full motorcycle license.
Obtaining your instructional permit
To get your instructional permit (or learner’s permit, as it’s often called), 
you must pass both a written test and an eye exam. To prepare, go online 
or call your state department or bureau of motor vehicles to find out how to
get a motorcycle instructional permit. You can also visit a driver’s license
bureau and ask for the information.
No matter which way you do it, the license bureau will give you a packet of
information that includes the requirements, instructional materials on how to
ride a motorcycle, and a booklet explaining traffic laws. Some states charge a
fee for this packet. If you’re doing this in person, you’ll probably need to take
some form of identification, such as your car driver’s license or a passport.
These materials are full of useful information, even for experienced 
motorcyclists. They cover, among other things, these topics:
 Proper riding gear
 The controls on a motorcycle
44
Part I: The Mysterious World of Motorcycling 

 Shifting and braking
 Turning, passing, and merging
 Handling curves
 Avoiding crashes
 Carrying passengers
After you get the materials home, study them. The information contained in
the materials will be on the written test that you need to pass to get your
instructional permit.
When you feel like you’ve studied enough to take the written exam, head on
down to your license bureau. When you’re there, examiners will test your
vision and then give you the written exam. When you pass, you get your
instructional permit.
These permits have restrictions. For example, you probably can only ride
during daylight, must wear a helmet and eye protection, can’t ride on the
freeway, and can’t carry passengers. That’s because new riders are at 
serious risk for getting hurt, and you’re supposed to be learning how to ride 
a motorcycle with the permit, not making cross-country trips. So, with your
instructional permit in hand, get training. Don’t venture onto the street on a
motorcycle because that is very dangerous without training. But, just think,
you’re only months away from getting your full license.
You have your learner’s permit, now learn!
After you have your learner’s permit, you need to learn how to ride a bike 
so that you can pass the riding exam to get your full motorcycle license. 
The motorcycle license, by the way, is an endorsement on your car driver’s
license, if you have one.
Start by practicing in a parking lot, such as in a school parking lot on a 
weekend. Practice going in a straight line slowly, clicking up a gear, clicking
back down a gear, and then stopping. Do this until you’re comfortable with
the maneuver.
Then practice riding in a straight line, turning around, and riding back. Get
comfortable with these maneuvers, and then do some figure eights. Do big
ones at first, and then get smaller and smaller.
Other maneuvers to practice in the parking lot are quick stops, swerving,
riding as slowly as possible, and riding at various speeds. However, 
remember to always ride at a speed that’s within your abilities.
45
Chapter 3: You Wouldn’t Fly a Jet Without Training, Would You?

Get comfortable with all these maneuvers in a parking lot before you 
even think about venturing into the street. You need to be able to perform
these functions without thinking about them to survive on the road. 
Practice, practice, practice so that shifting, braking, and all the other basic
skills needed to ride a motorcycle can be done without you having to think
about them.
After you’re comfortable, head out into the streets. Start out on country
roads or roads with little or no traffic. Practice what you learned from your
license branch informational materials about approaching intersections,
passing, and so on. After a while you’ll start to feel even more comfortable,
and then you can venture onto more crowded streets. You may even decide
to ride in the city at this point.
The big day: Receiving your 
official motorcycle license
After you feel comfortable riding, call the driver’s licensing station at your
local bureau or department of motor vehicles, and schedule a riding test. The
riding test, normally called the on-cycle skill test, tests your ability to control
your motorcycle and avoid crashes. Pass the test, and you get your license!
If your state accepts completion of a motorcycle safety training course in lieu
of taking the state riding examination, it’s better to take the course. You’ll feel
much less pressure, and you’ll learn a lot. (See the earlier section, “Training
with the Pros: MSF Courses,” for more information.)
The on-cycle skill test involves maneuvers such as starting and stopping,
turning, and swerving. The instructor runs you through drills between cones
and marked off areas of a parking lot. The turns can be pretty tight, and some
drills you need to complete within a specified amount of time. Remember:
The test can be intimidating, so you need to be a master of basic skills to
pass it.
You’ll have to bring a properly licensed and insured motorcycle to take the
test on (flip to Chapter 10 for more on insuring your bike). Also be sure to
bring a helmet, eye protection, and gloves. It’s a good idea to have good
motorcycle boots and a motorcycle jacket as well.
What to Do After You Get Your License
Even after you earn your motorcycle license, you must remember that you’re
still a novice rider. The first six months after getting a motorcycle license or
46
Part I: The Mysterious World of Motorcycling 

after getting a new or used bike are dangerous for a motorcyclist. For the
newbie, it’s dangerous because the rider lacks the skills needed to always
ride safely. For the veteran with a new or used bike, it’s dangerous because
the rider is unfamiliar with how the bike handles.
After you get your license, keep practicing. Do more parking-lot drills, and
ride in the country. Ride, ride, ride. Review the instructional materials that
you received when you applied for your temporary permit again and again.
Also, if you have riding buddies, ride with them. But don’t ride over your 
abilities. In other words, don’t try to keep up with them if they speed it up or
if they take curves faster than you want to. That’s how motorcyclists (even
experienced ones) get into trouble: by trying to keep up with their peers.
Finally, if you haven’t taken a basic motorcycle safety training class, take one.
Even though you have your license, don’t carry passengers until you’ve been
riding fairly regularly for at least six months. Why? Because the added weight
changes the dynamic of the motorcycle. The bike will take longer to stop,
take more effort to turn, and the suspension will feel different. These are all
things that could complicate riding for a novice rider.
Street survival training and 
other continuing education
Besides taking the Motorcycle Safety Foundation’s basic rider, experienced
rider, and dirt bike classes (discussed earlier in this chapter), it’s a good idea
to take more safety classes. You can never learn too much about riding a
motorcycle.
One good school in the eastern part of the United States that gives you 
real-world experience is the Stayin’ Safe Motorcycle Training school, formed
by the late Larry Grodsky. Grodsky was a motorcycle safety training expert
who spent about 30 years developing his program. He was killed while riding
in Texas in 2006 when he hit a deer, but his training team has kept the school
alive. The school offers tightly controlled, on-street training for both novice
and experienced riders. Plus, it offers tours that combine training with scenic
rides. Visit www.stayinsafe.com for more information.
Effective Pacific Northwest classes are offered by the Evergreen Safety
Council. Not only do they offer basic and experienced rider courses, but 
they also have a class called the Additional Riding Course for those who have
completed the basic class but aren’t ready for the experienced course. It
gives the new rider the opportunity to practice riding skills. Check out www.
esc.org for more details.

Chapter 3: You Wouldn’t Fly a Jet Without Training, Would You?

Streetmasters Motorcycle Workshops are held in Rosamond, California,
where street riders learn cornering techniques. Go to www.streetmasters.
info to learn more about these workshops.
You may be able to find other riding classes and safety training opportunities
near you. Ask about them at local motorcycle dealerships.
Track schools: The need for speed
Track schools aren’t just for racers anymore. A lot of schools that use asphalt
racetracks to train racers also offer courses for street riders, so think of 
them as performance riding schools. These courses are great because they
take place in a safe, controlled environment. For instance, there aren’t any
cars coming onto the track from side streets, you can go as fast as you want,
and you can practice your skills without the fear of getting smashed by an 
18-wheeler or another motorcycle.
Track school involves classroom and on-track instruction, with instructors
showing you how to ride and then critiquing your technique. Even longtime
riders with a lot of miles under their belts come away from track schools 
with new skills and a better understanding of how to ride safely. Plus, going
to a track school can really boost your confidence and teach you how to
focus while riding.
However, probably the main thing you learn in a track school is how to be
smooth in everything you do on a motorcycle. You learn how to be smooth
when accelerating, braking, turning, shifting your body weight, slowing, 
stopping, and more. It’s more difficult than you think, but once you learn 
how to be smooth, you’ll be a much better rider.
Some schools require that you use their bikes, and they’ll rent you a helmet
and safety gear if you don’t have your own. Other schools require you to
bring your own bike and safety gear. Classes range from one-day affairs to
programs that last three days or more. The classes are priced accordingly.
Schools may require at least a year’s experience on a streetbike before 
you can sign up for a class, and they may require special preparation of 
your motorcycle before it goes on the track. For instance, you may need to
secure all critical nuts with safety wire. Check with the school about its
requirements.
Here are some of the more popular track schools:
48
Part I: The Mysterious World of Motorcycling 

 The Kevin Schwantz Suzuki School (www.schwantzschool.com):
This school, which is taught by former World MotoGP motorcycle racing
champion Kevin Schwantz, takes place at the Road Atlanta racetrack 
in Braselton, Georgia. It’s only for Suzuki riders, but if you don’t own a
Suzuki you can rent one from the school for the class.
 Freddie Spencer’s High Performance Riding School (www.fast
freddie.com): Taught by Freddie Spencer (another former World
MotoGP racing champion), this school is held at the Las Vegas Motor
Speedway in Las Vegas, Nevada. Students at this school use 
school-supplied Honda motorcycles.
 STAR Motorcycle School (www.starmotorcycle.com): Operated by
former AMA racing champion Jason Pridmore, this school is actually
named the Skills and Techniques Advanced Riding Motorcycle School.
Classes are taught at racetracks around the country, from California 
to Illinois.
 CLASS Motorcycle Schools (www.classrides.com): Taught by former
AMA racing champion Reg Pridmore, CLASS courses are conducted in
California, and you use your own bike.
 Team Hammer Advanced Riding School and Track Rides
(www.teamhammer.com/school): This school has been around since
1990 and it was formed by Team Hammer, a roadracing team. You use
your own bike during these courses and rides.
 The California Superbike School (www.superbikeschool.com): Run
by Keith Code (who has been the guru to many racers), this school
offers training starting with the most common errors made by novice
riders up to a unique program for each rider to work on problem areas.
Code uses special training motorcycles to teach such things as braking
and cornering.
 The Ed Bargy Racing School (www.edbargyracingschool.com): This
school, which is run by former racer Ed Bargy, is offered at East Coast
racetracks. The school is also known as Ed Bargy Racing Services.
You may be able to find a roadracing club in your area that offers rider 
training at a local racetrack. Check with your local motorcycle dealerships to
find out. Plus, find out if your local roadracing club offers track days, where
you’re allowed on the track to hone your skills without instructors. The club
usually divides the attendees into different groups based on the riders’ skills
and experience. These are much less expensive than track schools. A track
day can cost around $150, while track school can cost $500 to $1,500 or more.

Welcome to 
the Club

In this part . . .
T
he seemingly complicated world of motorcycling can
be mind-numbing to the outsider or the person who
wants to learn how to ride. So in this part, I unravel the
mysteries of motorcycling, including describing the vari-
ous subgroups of motorcyclists, what motorcycles they
ride, and what safety gear they wear. After all, if you want
to be a motorcyclist, you want to be sure you fall into a
crowd you’re happy with.
In this part, I also recognize the growing number of women
getting involved in motorcycling. I explain the challenges
they face being accepted in motorcycling circles, and I
show how they can find properly-sized safety gear, make
their bikes fit their bodies, and get in touch with other
female motorcyclists to get as much fun and excitement
out of the sport as possible. Also, we adults shouldn’t
have all the fun all the time. So I describe in detail how to
get your kids safely involved in motorcycling so that you
can share this family sport.

 Surveying the different motorcycles available
 Exploring the many motorcycling subcultures
 Dressing and speaking to fit in with your chosen biker crowd
A
lot of people have a vague idea that there are different types of motor-
cycles. And most folks believe that a motorcyclist is a motorcyclist. 
But the fact is that the colorful world of motorcycling has a dizzying array 
of motorcycles, from big, almost-lumbering touring machines to nimble 
sportbikes that are rocket ships on the road.
And motorcyclists are just as varied. They ride with their own clothing,
attend specific gatherings, and have their own language — and it all 
depends on what they ride. Whether you ride a cruiser, tourer, sportbike, 
or streetfighter, you’re sure to find unwritten rules for fitting in with a 
particular motorcycling subgroup.
In this chapter you discover the different types of motorcycles that are 
available. You get a peek at some of the trickest machines on the market, 
with some key specifications such as engine size, seat height, and dry weight.
Finally, you also get a snapshot of different types of motorcyclists and what
makes these subcultures of motorcycling special. Then you can decide where
you think you’d fit in best.

Cruiser Cool and Custom Chic
Cruisers, the most popular motorcycles in America today, are characterized by
their high weights, low seat heights, comfortable, laid-back seating positions,
and high-torque motors. These reliable, low-maintenance bikes are meant for
cruising, whether it’s down to the local hangout or across the country. No
matter where you’re headed, you’re bound to look cool on a cruiser.
Discovering the flashy bikes
Cruisers look cool. So by default, riders look cool riding them. Plus, they’re
pretty comfortable to ride compared to some other styles of motorcycles.
These are the reasons that motorcyclists buy cruisers. After all, other bikes
stop better, accelerate better, turn better, and are cheaper. But a cruiser 
lets a doctor, a lawyer, or an accountant feel like a bad boy (or girl) on the
weekends without getting into any real trouble.
In this section, I introduce you to the four basic divisions in the cruiser
world, and I give you a look at some of the most popular cruiser styles on 
the market today.
Harley-Davidsons
The American-made Harley-Davidson is the quintessential cruiser (although
Harley does make some other types of bikes). The 2008 Harley-Davidson

Part II: Welcome to the Club 
Why are the specs important?
Throughout this chapter, I give the specs on var-
ious bikes. You may be wondering why. Here are
just a few reasons:
 If you have a 30-inch inseam, you probably
don’t want a bike with a 32-inch seat height
(unless you’re a ballerina and are used to
standing on your tippy-toes). Similarly, if
you’re a small person, you don’t want an 800-
pound motorcycle to push around in parking
lots or garages. Finally, a longer wheelbase
means a bigger bike and more straight-line
stability, but the bike will turn more slowly.
 The key specs, such as engine size, seat
height, claimed dry weight (which is claimed
by the manufacturer and is usually opti-
mistic, like the weight you give for your
driver’s license), wheelbase, and suggested
retail, are the minimum specs that you need
to know in order to compare machines
before deciding what to test ride and buy.
 Motorcyclists love talking specs, even if it’s
just the basic specs such as engine size 
and seat height. Know a few key specs and
you’ll impress friends and strangers alike.
Children, however, will remain unimpressed
until you tell them that your bike goes a 
zillion miles an hour.

FXDL Dyna Low Rider (shown in Figure 4-1) is just one of the many Harleys
you can choose from. Here are the key specs for this bike:
Engine: 96 cubic inches (1,584cc)
Seat height: 26.8 inches
Wheelbase: 64.6 inches
Claimed dry weight: 641 pounds
Suggested retail: $14,995

Japanese (or metric) cruisers
The Japanese Big Four manufacturers — Honda, Kawasaki, Suzuki, and
Yamaha — began making cruisers in the 1970s, taking their styling cues from
Harley-Davidson. They’re called metric cruisers because their nuts and bolts
are metric, not American SAE fasteners. Also, their engine sizes are normally
given in cubic centimeters, 1,670cc for example, rather than in cubic inches,
like 110ci, which is Harley-Davidson’s tradition. The 2008 Kawasaki Vulcan
1500 Classic (see Figure 4-2) is an example of this type of cruiser. Here are 
the key specs on this machine:
Engine: 90 cubic inches (1,470cc)
Seat height: 27.6 inches
Wheelbase: 65.6 inches
Claimed dry weight: 659 pounds
Suggested retail: $9,699

Customs, choppers, and show customs
Following World War II, motorcyclists removed parts and cut parts up to
make their bikes faster. Doing this also gave their motorcycles a unique look.
These machines became known as bobbers. Motorcyclists continued this
trend through the years. Riders in the 1960s chopped things off, added
extended front forks, and made other changes with styling in mind to create
bikes of their own, which came to be known as choppers.
Individual bike builders in the 1960s saw what motorcyclists were doing to
their machines and began building similar bikes for cash-paying customers.
These bikes, still popular today, are called customs because they’re custom
made and include few parts from the big motorcycle manufacturers.
The show custom world is a whole different animal, with bike prices ranging
from $40,000 to $350,000. They usually have outrageous styling and wild paint
jobs, and some have more pointy additions than a porcupine. These custom
bikes usually don’t see much road time; instead they appear in bike shows.
Show bike motorcyclists aren’t interested in the usual specs for their
machines. Sure, size matters for the engine, but riders are more interested in
the parts on the bike, and who made them, rather than things like seat height
or claimed dry weight. Figure 4-3 shows an example of a custom American
show bike. Here are the specs for that bike:

Power cruisers
Modern cruisers have always been known for their relative comfort, reliabil-
ity and ease of maintenance, but these days some riders want more. They
want performance. And this desire has spawned machines called power cruis-
ers, which feature high-performance motors, brakes, and suspension straight
from the factory. The 1,670cc Star Warrior, made by Yamaha, is a popular
power cruiser (see Figure 4-4). Here are the specs on this power cruiser:
Engine: 102 cubic inches (1,670cc)
Seat height: 28.7 inches
Wheelbase: 65.6 inches
Claimed dry weight: 613 pounds

Sporting the cruiser rider’s uniform
Cruiser riders typically sport traditional biker’s garb, which consists of these:
 Black leather jacket
 Black leather pants
 Heavy black boots
 Black leather gloves
However, as a cruiser rider, you can thumb your nose at tradition if you want.
Black leather became the garb of choice back in the day when bikes were
unreliable and a lot of time was spent on the roadside repairing them. Bikers
would throw down their black leather jackets to kneel on and the jackets
wouldn’t show as much dirt or oil stains. Those days are over thanks to the
super-reliability of motorcycles today, but many riders stick with the black
garb because they like the bad-boy or bad-gal look. So what if it gets really
hot? It looks really cool.
Looking like a Harley-Davidson rider
In Harley-Davidson culture, if you want to fit in, you pretty much have to 
wear — at a minimum — a black leather jacket and black boots. Sometimes,
however, you will see rebels wearing (gasp!) brown leather. Leather chaps 
Figure 4-4:
The 2008
Star
Warrior.
58
Part II: Welcome to the Club 

are favored over black leather pants, although you’ll see the pants some-
times. A sleeveless denim jacket with patches of skulls or playing cards is
also popular attire.
In states where the law doesn’t require riders to wear helmets, it’s popular
for Harley-Davidson riders to wear bandannas tied around the head to keep
their hair from being blown around and getting tangled in the wind. Other
riders wear a special do-rag that looks like a bandanna but is easier to wrap
around the head —because it has a hook-and-loop fastener. Similarly, women
with long hair like to keep their hair neat by wearing special ponytail sleeves
that are usually made of leather.
In states where helmets are required, most Harley-Davidson riders like to
wear the smallest helmet possible — a beanie helmet that covers just the top
of the head. (I describe helmets in more detail in Chapter 5.)
And when riding a Harley-Davidson, you’ve got to wear a Harley-Davidson T-
shirt. Those shirts are popular even among non–Harley-Davidson riders. For
added coolness, you need shirts from the neat places you’ve visited, such as
the Honolulu Harley-Davidson shop or one in Daytona Beach, Florida. T-shirts
from biker bars, such as the Smiling Skull in Athens, Ohio, are also popular.
Heavy, black engineering boots are a favorite of the Harley-Davidson bunch.
Any of the several styles of boots made by Harley-Davidson are fair game as
well. All in all, Harley-Davidson riders like to wear stuff that says “Harley-
Davidson” on it. Some of the riders even get Harley-Davidson tattoos because
they’re so loyal to the American brand.
Custom bike riders tend to mimic the Harley-Davidson crowd in their 
appearance.
Dressing like a metric cruiser biker
When riding metric or power cruisers you can pretty much wear what you
want, but you’ll definitely still see a lot of black or brown leather. Jackets
made of synthetics, which aren’t as hot as leather, aren’t frowned on either.
The bottom line is this: Wear whatever makes you feel good. If you like bad-
boy black, go for it. Or, if you want to be more comfortable, go the synthetic
route. Either way you’ll fit in. (Check out Chapter 5, where I provide all the
information you need to gear up — regardless of the style you choose.)
Bandannas and do-rags are popular when riders aren’t wearing helmets.
When wearing a helmet, cruiser riders don’t really have a favorite style. 
Each rider picks what he or she likes. As far as footwear goes, most cruiser
riders favor heavy engineer boots or other motorcycle styles, such as 
lace-up boots, that are made for cruising.

Chapter 4: Bikes and Biker Culture: You Are What You Ride

Where to go and how to be cool
Cruiser riders are known for their short hops, which usually mean cruising
on a Saturday from bar to bar. Go on the ride, share the camaraderie, just
don’t drink! In fact, staying sober and watching your buds’ alcohol-induced
antics may prove to be quite entertaining! (But as always, if you notice 
someone who’s entirely too buzzed to be riding, be sure to find him or her 
a ride home.)
Bike nights are another ritual for cruiser riders. They’re simply gatherings 
of motorcyclists at a local bar, restaurant, or motorcycle shop to eat, maybe
drink, talk bikes, and look at the machinery in the parking lot. Some bike
nights attract 1,000 or more bikers. It’s a great place to feel like you belong.
And luckily these gatherings have a built-in excuse for not drinking: They 
usually happen on work nights.
Motorcycle clubs also have organized rides, whether to raise money for 
charity or just to enjoy the countryside. They’re usually advertised at local
motorcycle shops or at biker bars. Cruiser riders also get together with a
couple buds to take trips every now and then. They may travel to a rally or
even just visit a different part of the country. (I cover rallies and trips in
Chapter 16.)
And, finally, remember that you’re a cruiser rider, so you can be a lone wolf.
When you feel the need to ride, just head out to the beach, the mountains,

Part II: Welcome to the Club 
Brand loyalty and the Harley rider
Most motorcyclists are fiercely loyal to the brand
of motorcycle they ride, particularly Harley-
Davidson riders. (Harley riders truly are differ-
ent!) This brand loyalty has sparked the creation
of brand-specific clubs like H.O.G. — the Harley
Owners Group — or the STAR Touring & Riding
Association. (Check out Chapter 19 for more on
these and other brand-specific clubs.)
Although attitudes are changing, a lot of Harley-
Davidson riders are still trying to portray an
outlaw image, and they tend to look down on
other makes and models. Japanese sportbikes
(see the later section “Sportbikes: 0 to 60 mph in
2.8 Seconds”), which Harley riders call “rice-
burners,” are particularly held in contempt. 
Old-school Harley riders despise Japanese
machines, and sometimes they even have a 
sacrificial Japanese bike at their rallies for rally-
goers to take turns whacking with a sledgeham-
mer. As if it isn’t already obvious: Tread cautiously
around Harley riders if you own a Japanese
machine.
You don’t have to go to the Japanese bike-bash-
ing extreme to fit in with most Harley crowds, but
you do have to know the different Harley models
by their alphabet soup designations: XL (Sport-
ster), FXD family (Dyna), FXST (Softail Standard),
FXSTSSE (Screamin’ Eagle Softail Springer), and
so on. Go to the Harley-Davidson Web site
(www.harley-davidson.com) for more
details. In fact, I suggest you make that site your
new best friend.

or wherever. And if you run into another cruiser rider stopped somewhere,
take the time to chat.
Talking cruiser speak
Like all motorcyclists, cruiser, power cruiser, and custom riders like to talk
about bikes. So if you want to fit in, you have get in on the lingo. For instance,
if you ride a metric cruiser, get to know the various models available and
their basic specs. If you ride a Harley, you must at least know the different
families sold: Sportster, Dyna, Softail, VRSC, and Touring, for example, 
and the variations of the families, such as Softail Springer. It may seem 
complicated. And, well, it is.
All you Harley riders out there should absolutely know that Willie G.
Davidson (who’s also known as “Willie G.”) is the Harley-Davidson Motor
Company’s styling guru. He’s a descendant of the company founders and 
a god among Harley riders.
All cruiser riders have a unique language when it comes to their bikes. Why?
Because all their machines have things that others don’t. So you’ll hear talk
about all sorts of different terms, including some of the following:
 Floorboards: These are platforms for your feet.
 Heel-toe shifters: These are shifters that you can manipulate with your
heel or toe.
 Shotgun, slash-cut, or other styles of mufflers: Shotgun mufflers are 
basically round tube designs; pipes with a slash-cut are just that, pipes
with a slash-cut at the end.
 Straight pipes: These are mufflers with their baffles taken out. Straight
pipes make the bike loud and very annoying to nonriders (and many
other motorcyclists as well). I talk about straight pipes more in 
Chapter 12.
 Knucklehead, Panhead, and Shovelhead motors: These are some of 
the different Harley-Davidson motors made over the years. They get
their names because the Knucklehead looks like it has hand knuckles 
on the head, the head of a Panhead looks like a pan, and, of course, the
head of a Shovelhead looks like the business end of a shovel.
The quickest way to learn the language is to read lots and lots of cruiser 
magazines. You can find magazines for metric cruisers and Harleys. Some
examples of these magazines include American Iron Magazine, American
Rider, Cruising Rider, Easyriders, Motorcycle Cruiser, RoadBike, and V-Twin.
Also helpful when learning cruiser lingo is hanging around cruiser riders 
and listening to what they talk about.

Chapter 4: Bikes and Biker Culture: You Are What You Ride

Touring with the Long-Distance Bikes
Touring machines are long-distance motorcycles built for comfort. They’re
big, heavy, and able to click off thousands of miles on the road without a
whimper. And they’re expensive.
But, on the upside, they hold their value relatively well and most buyers
won’t balk at high mileage on the machine, since that’s what they’re made 
for. These aren’t bare-bones bikes either — they have a lot of the luxuries
that you’d want for a long-distance ride, like a plush seat and stereo.
If you plan to do any long-distance traveling with a passenger, a touring
machine is the way to go. Your passenger will thank you. After all, you as 
the rider are pretty busy handling the machine while your passenger is just
sitting back enjoying the sights. A touring bike allows the passenger to be
very comfortable during the ride.
Checking out bikes built for the long haul
You can choose from three basic types of touring machines: luxury tourers,
sport tourers, and adventure tourers. Luxury touring riders are modern-day
cowboys discovering America on long treks at their own pace. Sport-touring
riders enjoy spirited riding on twisty back roads during their cross-country
jaunts. Adventure touring riders tool around on machines that look like 
big dirt bikes, but they spend most of their time on the road. The following
sections provide details about these three types of machines and show 
popular examples of each.
Luxury tourers
Luxury tourers, also known as full dressers, or to old-timers, baggers, are 
the granddaddy of touring machines. Why? Pure comfort. Luxury touring
machines are big, heavy, and relatively slow handling. They also feature an
upright seating position. In fact, these bikes have almost as many luxuries 
as a car. You can get a luxury tourer decked out with a high windscreen, big
front fairing (the bodywork on the front of the bike to help protect you from

Sport tourers
The sport tourers are machines that combine the adrenaline-pumping acceler-
ation, braking power, and handling of a high-performance bike with the lug-
gage of a touring machine. Of course, they weigh more than a
high-performance sport machine because of added luggage, bigger body-
work, and other touring necessities, but they’re a lot more fun to ride on
twisty roads than luxury tourers. See Figure 4-6 for an example of a sport
tourer. Here are the specs on this bike:

Adventure tourers
Adventure tourers are street-legal off-road machines on steroids. Outfitted
with luggage, these bikes are designed to cross hundreds or even thousands
of miles of rugged country and ask for more. They have high ground clear-
ance, big gas tanks, and motors with lots of stump-pulling torque. Even
though they look like they should be crossing the African desert, most adven-
ture-touring riders spend their time on freeways and paved roads, with occa-
sional jaunts down gravel or dirt roads. But hey, the bikes look really cool
and the riders feel like adventurers. Figure 4-7 shows an example of an adven-
ture tourer. Here are the specs of the machine:
Engine: 1,170cc

Stylin’: The right looks for touring riders
For a luxury tourer rider, dressing in the proper gear is easy: Almost anything
goes. Leather jackets and pants offer the best protection, and they come in
many styles and colors. But many in the touring crowd prefer synthetic riding
gear, which offers more comfort in hot weather. And synthetic gear offers
plenty of protection for the touring rider with its built-in armor protection. 
A three-quarter, flip-up or full-face helmet is the way to go for head gear. 
(I discuss various types of helmets in Chapter 5.) For boots, luxury touring
riders generally go with the same types of boots that cruiser riders wear 
(you can read about cruiser gear earlier in the chapter).
Sport-touring riders, however, like to wear clothes that lean more toward 
the “sport” than the “touring” side because of the chance of a crash while
riding twisty roads at a spirited pace. A leather jacket with a tighter fit than
the luxury touring riders wear is the way to go. Equally popular, though, are
synthetic jackets and pants. Sport-touring riders wear full-face helmets, and
generally wear sport boots, which I discuss in Chapter 5.
For the adventure tourer, the right look is all function. Don’t even think 
about leather: It’s adventure-touring gear, Baybee! You need a synthetic three-

Chapter 4: Bikes and Biker Culture: You Are What You Ride

quarter length jacket that reaches below the waist and is chock-full of big
pockets to provide wind protection, storage pockets, and the signature look.
Your pants will be synthetic as well. These riders generally wear full-face 
helmets, but their boots are either sport or tall lace-up boots.
If there’s a uniform among the touring crowd, especially BMW riders, it’s the
Aerostich Roadcrafter one-piece suit or the Roadcrafter jacket and pants.
These synthetic suits slip on easily over your clothes and have a lot of special
touches, like big pockets, protective padding, and reflective panels so you’re
easy to spot in the dark. Check out www.aerostich.com for more details.
Fitting in with the touring crowd
Touring riders are often lone wolves (though sometimes they run in small
packs), so you probably won’t see them gathering together on weekends for
group rides. However, you’ll likely bump into them alone or in small groups
during their long-distance travels. Or you may find them at major rallies for
touring riders where they gather to swap stories and go on short rides. It’s
easy to fit in. All you have to do is talk about motorcycles, riding, trips, gear,
or anything else motorcycling related. They’re very accepting of all riders.
Touring riders especially like to talk about their machines and the special
gadgets on them, like global positioning systems or extra lights. Touring
riders also like to talk about great trips, great roads, and getting caught 
riding in bad weather!
To get a feel for the touring crowd and pick up some of the lingo, check out
some of the touring magazines, including Rider and Road Runner. You can
also take a look at the publications of touring clubs, such as the BMW
Motorcycle Owners of America or the Honda Sport Touring Association. In
fact, if you join a touring club you’ll make new friends and pick up the lingo
pretty quick. I discuss some touring clubs in Chapter 19. Last but not least,
you can flip through the American Motorcyclist, the magazine of the American
Motorcyclist Association.
Sportbikes: 0 to 60 in 2.8 seconds
Sportbikes, also called crotch rockets by non–sportbike riders, are the thor-
oughbreds of the street motorcycling world — race bikes with turn signals
and license plates. The acceleration takes your breath away, and the G-forces
you feel when braking make your heart stop. You don’t sit on a sportbike, 
you crouch down in it. Sportbikes are characterized by their lightweight,
powerful motors, short wheelbases, exceptional stopping power, and 
razor-sharp handling.
66
Part II: Welcome to the Club 

You’ll hear nonriders call a sportbike a Ninja, but that’s wrong. Kawasaki 
produces a Ninja line of sportbikes, so don’t call a sportbike a Ninja unless 
it is, in fact, one of the Kawasaki machines.
The Suzuki GSX-R sportbikes are considered among the best. Check out
Figure 4-8 to see a photo of this bike. Here are the specs:

Dressing like Ricky Roadracer
For the hard-core sportbike rider, one-piece or two-piece, zip-together 
roadrace leathers are the way to go. Most sportbikers, however, wear a tight
roadrace-cut leather jacket and bluejeans or other pants.
Synthetic jackets, even some made of mesh, are becoming more and more
popular because they’re cooler than leather. However, these jackets don’t
offer the same high level of protection. For this crowd, colorful garb that
matches the colors on your bike is the only way to go.

Chapter 4: Bikes and Biker Culture: You Are What You Ride

A full-face helmet is the helmet of choice for sportbike riders who wear 
helmets — and most do. Also, roadrace-style boots are the footwear of
choice. These days you may see a lot of young people on sportbikes who
aren’t wearing helmets or other proper safety gear. In fact, they may be 
riding with tennis shoes or flip-flops. While they may think they look 
cool, when they crash they are going to get very hurt. Remember: True
sportbikers wear all the safety gear they can.
Fitting in with the sportbike crowd
Sportbikers are a lot like cruiser riders in that they’re very social, but they
tend to hang with friends rather than sportbikers they don’t know. They
gather in groups in which everyone knows each other for spirited weekend
rides, and they spend time together before and after the ride talking about
riding and bikes. You can’t just show up for one of these rides, however. You
have to be invited by a friend who’s already part of the group. Sportbikers
also like to gather at bike nights, which are gatherings of motorcyclists hosted
by a restaurant or other business, usually on weekday evenings. Make a
friend there, and you’ll probably be invited on a ride. Note to women: Drop 
a hint that you’re looking for someone to ride with and you’ll get more 
invitations than you can handle.
To talk the talk, remember that this crowd is all about performance. Know 
the following details inside and out:
 The hottest sportbikes on the market, the key specifications, the 
different performance tires available, and the popular upgrades, such 
as a rear fender eliminator kit that makes a sportbike look even more
like a race bike
 The top stars of AMA Superbike and international MotoGP racing (and
don’t forget to follow their careers)
 Roadracer language, such as “throw it in the weeds,” which means go 
off the road and crash, usually because a rider went too fast into a turn
Simply hang out with sportbikers, listen, and nod when they talk. You’ll 
pick up the lingo quickly. Read sportbike-related magazines to stay up on 
the latest racing news, lingo, and performance products. Some popular 
magazines include Cycle World, Motorcyclist, Sport Rider, 2 Wheel Tuner, and
Road Racer X.
Naked Machines
Naked bikes are bikes with minimal bodywork. The minimal bodywork allows
you to show off the motor. These machines are generally considered standard

Part II: Welcome to the Club 

motorcycles. They have an upright seating position and motors with smooth
power delivery (which make them relatively easy to ride), and they’re also
comfortable. They’re all-around machines that can go across town or across
the country.
Naked riders, that is, riders of naked bikes, are probably the only motorcy-
clists who woke up one day and said, “I want to ride a motorcycle” (rather
than saying “I want to tour the country on a bike” or “I want to look bad” 
or “I want to go fast”). As such, they don’t have their own crowd or events.
You’ll find some of them hooking up with cruiser riders and others falling in
with the sportbike crowd, depending on the type of riding they like.
Another naked bike you may hear about is called a streetfighter, but it doesn’t
fall into the conventional naked bike category. Streetfighters are generally
stripped-down sportbikes ridden by young riders with a reputation for hooli-
ganism — popping wheelies, doing wheelstands on the front wheel, burning
donuts, and performing other stunts. Streetfighters are more popular in
Europe than they are in America. Streetfighter riders tend to run with the
sportbike crowd.
Kawasaki’s Z1000, shown in Figure 4-9, is a perfect example of a naked
machine. Here are the specs:
Engine: 953cc
Seat height: 32.3 inches
Wheelbase: 56.9 inches
Claimed dry weight: Not available
Suggested retail: $8,899
As for attire, naked bike or standard riders generally wear sedate leather or
synthetic jackets and bluejeans or synthetic pants. But almost anything 
goes. So if you want flashier garb, go for it. A black leather jacket is okay, but
don’t go for a full-on Harley-rider look. That would be considered bad form.
Full-face helmets are the helmet of choice, while footwear can be cruiser chic
or sportbike cool. The great thing about this crowd is that you’ll likely be
accepted no matter what way you dress.
Because standard riders tend to gravitate toward the cruiser or sportbike
crowd, they need to know the lingo of the people they ride with. Check out
the cruiser and sportbike sections earlier in the chapter for more tips on 
getting in with the crowd you’re hanging with.

Dual-Purpose Bikes and Dirt Machines
You don’t have to ride on the street to be a motorcyclist. Go ahead, have
some fun in the dirt. This section shows you a couple of options.
Getting to know bikes made for the dirt
Many motorcyclists got their start as kids riding in the dirt, and their love of
motorcycling included street riding as they got older. Most dirt riders also
have streetbikes. However, most street riders don’t also have dirt bikes.
Either way, riding in the dirt is a lot of fun, and it’s a great family sport too. As
I explain in Chapter 3, dirt riding even makes you a better street rider. If you
pick up a 25-year-old dirt bike for $500, you can have a million dollars worth
of fun. (And learn a lot about fixing and maintaining a motorcycle!)
Riding the street and the trails
Dual-purpose or dual-sport bikes are at home on the road or in the trails.
They’re tall, street-legal machines with an upright seating position and tires
that are made for both street and dirt use.
Figure 4-9:
The 2008
Kawasaki

Part II: Welcome to the Club 

A dual-purpose bike is a compromise between a street and dirt machine, 
so you have to be mindful of that fact. For instance, you may not want to 
lean the bike over as far on the road as you would on a pure streetbike, and
you may not want to do much freeway riding. And, because of their weight,
these bikes can be a handful when on the trails. But owners of these bikes
nonetheless love them because they’re all-around machines that are easy to
ride in traffic and they’re cheap.
Kawasaki’s KLR650 (see Figure 4-10) is one of the more popular dual-purpose
machines. Here are the specs:
Engine: 651cc
Seat height: 35 inches
Wheelbase: 58.3 inches
Claimed dry weight: 386 pounds
Suggested retail: $5,349

Going for dirt only
If you don’t want to compromise with a dual-purpose bike, get a strictly 
off-road machine, like an enduro or a motocrosser. Simply put, an enduro is 
a dirt bike with lighting and a spark arrester on the muffler. Motocross bikes
are like enduros but are lighter racing machines with a little more power.
However, motocrossers don’t have the lights and other enduro-related 
equipment.

Chapter 4: Bikes and Biker Culture: You Are What You Ride

If you decide to get a motocrosser to play with, start small. Otherwise you
may find yourself getting a worm’s eye view of the trail a lot more often than
you’d like because of the big bike’s power.
Yamaha builds a well-liked off-road machine, shown in Figure 4-11. Here are
its specs:
Engine: 449cc
Seat height: 38.6 inches
Wheelbase: 58.5 inches
Claimed dry weight: 248 pounds
Suggested retail: $7,199

Dressing the part and fitting in
Dual-purpose riders wear three-quarter length jackets with lots of pockets
and synthetic pants for protection. They may also sport a motocross jersey
and pants if they plan to spend the day on the trails. Generally speaking it’s
strictly motocross gear for enduro and motocross riders in the dirt. What 
I mean by motocross gear is light, padded jerseys (like football jerseys) and
pants made specifically for riding off the road. Motocross jerseys are even
popular among kids for everyday wear, even if they don’t ride motorcycles.
Figure 4-11:

72
Part II: Welcome to the Club 

Dual-purpose riders generally wear a sport-style boot when riding on the
street. In the dirt, dual-sporters and motocrossers prefer boots made for
motocross, which are heavily padded and armored tall boots made to 
withstand a pounding against tree limbs and other off-road obstacles.
For helmets, dual-sporters wear full-face street helmets on the street. They,
along with the motocrossers, wear specially designed motocross helmets in
the dirt. These full-face helmets have large eyeports so riders can also wear
goggles. These helmets also have a visor to help block the sun and deflect
small branches and rocks tossed by your buddy’s bike ahead of you.
Dirt riders love dirt riding and they enjoy the company of other dirt riders.
To fit in, simply show up for a ride or join a club. (I tell you how to find an
organized trail ride in your area in Chapter 16.) Be sure to learn the lingo,
including terms like auger in (fall off your bike landing head first) and face
plant (fall off your bike and land face first). Sprinkle stories of your latest 
trail ride with these two terms and you’ll get a smile from your fellow riders.
They’ve all been there with sheepish grins under their helmets. Read 
dirt- and trail-riding magazines to catch on to the lingo and to get riding tips.
Some magazines you might check out include Dirt Rider, Racer X, and
Transworld Motocross.

any folks say that the clothes make the man (or woman), and nowhere
is that more true than in the diverse world of motorcycling. Riding
gear says a lot about a motorcyclist. One quick look, and you know that he or
she is a cruiser rider, sportbiker, tourer, or whatever. For the rider, wearing
the right gear means fitting in with the crowd you’re hanging with on that
particular day. Or it can mean feeling like you wore your tux or classic little
black dress to a square dance.
The most important thing to consider, though, is that your motorcycle gear
must protect you in a crash. How good your jacket looks just won’t matter,
for example, if its seams explode and shred when you hit the pavement. And
boots are no good to you if the soles are slick leather that slide around every
time you put your feet down at a stoplight or stop sign.
The uninitiated may think they can just look at a garment and know it’s safe
for motorcycling. But certain aspects make safety gear true motorcycling
jackets, pants, helmets, and gloves. Other “features” make them fashions that
have no business being worn while riding a motorcycle. To be blunt, the
wrong gear can result in serious injury in a crash.
In this chapter, you discover the array of helmets, jackets, gloves, boots, and
pants available to motorcyclists that are designed to protect in a crash.
They’re all important parts of your package of safety gear. Here you survey
the different types and styles available, get a feel for the prices, and find out
what to avoid. When you start wearing your protective gear consistently,
you’ll feel like something is wrong every time you leave the house on your
bike without wearing your helmet, jacket, gloves, boots, or riding pants.

A Helmet: The Best Protection 
Next to Your Brain
A motorcycle helmet says you’re a true motorcyclist. After all, anyone can
walk around wearing a motorcycle jacket or even a jacket and chaps. But
when you see someone carrying a helmet, you know that person is a rider,
not someone just dressed up like a motorcyclist. In fact, a nonrider probably
would feel pretty goofy carrying around a helmet.
But riders don’t have helmets because they want to show the world they
ride. They want to protect their noggins, and a helmet does that well. Imagine
just sitting on your bike in a parking lot and tipping over, hitting your head on
the asphalt. That fall alone could seriously injure you. Now imagine riding
down a nice, scenic country road at about 35 mph. You bank your bike into a
corner and hit some gravel. At that point, your rear tire loses traction, you
get spit on the ground, and then you hit your head on the road. In this type of
situation, a helmet will save you.
Even if you don’t want to wear a helmet, you need one. Your state may
require motorcyclists to wear a helmet, or this may be the law in a state you
plan to ride to or through. (You can find out the requirements by checking
the state-by-state motorcycling laws summarized in Appendix B.) So you may
as well get a comfortable helmet that you’re willing to wear.
The following sections discuss the different types of helmets available, how
to get a great fit, and more.
Deciding which type of helmet fits you
The helmet market is very competitive, so companies are always coming up
with new designs and new features — which is great for motorcyclists. You
can find all sorts of different helmets, including the following:
 Full-face helmets, which cover your entire head, including your face
 Flip-up helmets, which are full-face helmets that allow you to flip up the
entire front
 Three-quarter helmets, which cover the top and sides of your head
 Half helmets, also called a shorties or beanies, which just basically cover
the top of your head
The following sections discuss each of these types in detail so you can
choose the one that suits your needs.
76
Part II: Welcome to the Club 

Full-face and flip-up helmets
For maximum protection, a full-face (see Figure 5-1a) or flip-up helmet (see
Figure 5-1b) is the way to go. Full-face and flip-up helmets all have a polycar-
bonate faceshield, also called a visor, over the eyeport that you can flip up
and down. Helmets come standard with a clear shield, although most riders
also like to purchase a smokeshield to use on sunny days. Other colors are
also available.
Not only does a full-face or flip-up helmet protect all sides of your head and
your face from a nasty pounding or scraping if you get in a crash, but this
type of helmet also protects your eyes, nose, and face from serious injury
from rocks, bugs, and even birds. Imagine cruising down the highway only to
have a stone kicked up by a truck tire hit you in the face; or what if a bird
flies right into your nose? It happens. And it hurts.
Three-quarter helmets
Some riders prefer three-quarter helmets (see Figure 5-2), because they want
to feel the wind in their faces when they ride, or maybe because they feel
claustrophobic in a full-face helmet.

Chapter 5: Dress for Success
Protecting your eyes
All states require that you wear eye protection
when you ride. However, some states let you ride
without if you have a windscreen on your motor-
cycle that’s above eye level. With a full-face or
flip-up helmet, the faceshield serves as your eye
protection. But if you ride with the front of your
flip-up helmet flipped up, you need to wear eye
protection, such as glasses or goggles. That eye
protection must be able to withstand an impact
(from a rock, for example). Your best bet for get-
ting eye protection that truly protects your eyes
is to visit a motorcycle shop. Forget about going
to the local drugstore and picking up a pair of $5
sunglasses; they won’t save your sight.

You’ll find some very good, comfortable three-quarter helmets on the market.
The downside, of course, is that your face is unprotected not only in a crash,
but also from stones, bugs, and even rain that can really, really sting when
you’re riding 55 mph.
Half helmets
The half helmet, sometimes called a beanie (see Figure 5-3), offers little 
protection because motorcyclists rarely fall directly on the top of their heads.
But a half helmet is better than no helmet — at least it offers a little bit of 
protection. Half-helmets are favored by hard-core cruiser types who are
forced to wear helmets by state law.

Part II: Welcome to the Club 

Ensuring that a helmet meets 
federal safety requirements
Nonmotorcyclists may have an image of bikers cruising down the road on
their big motorcycles wearing jean jackets with the arms cut off and donning
World War II–style German helmets. That may be a popular image from the
movies, but when is the last time you saw a motorcyclist wearing that type of
helmet? Probably never. If you did, you can be sure it was illegal.
That’s because all helmets sold in the United States must meet strict federal
Department of Transportation (DOT) impact standards. And to show that a
helmet meets that standard, it must have a DOT sticker attached to the back
of it. If you’re considering buying a helmet and find one that doesn’t have a
DOT sticker, don’t buy it. It’s illegal and it won’t protect your head. These are
called novelty helmets for a reason.
When looking at helmets, you’ll sometimes find that they also have a sticker
from the Snell Memorial Foundation. This certification differs somewhat from
the federal DOT certification. The Snell certification offers more protection
from impacts sustained at higher speeds. Do you need a helmet with Snell
certification? Not legally, but it’s good for peace of mind.
A helmet is made up of a shell (usually a fiberglass or polycarbonate compos-
ite), expanded polystyrene foam designed to crush upon impact so that the
force of the impact isn’t transmitted to your brain, and a chin strap. Helmets
are designed to survive only one solid impact, so even dropping your helmet
on the sidewalk can seriously reduce its ability to protect your head. Handle
your helmet carefully — and don’t set it on your motorcycle mirror because
doing so can crush the expanded polystyrene foam. Also, it’s recommended
that you get a new helmet every five years. Why? Gas fumes from riding, or
even from your garage (if you store your helmet there), can break down the
foam. Besides, with advances in helmet technology and designs, you’ll want a
new helmet within five years anyway.
79
Chapter 5: Dress for Success
Protecting your head in style
Helmet styles and colors abound in the market-
place, so you’re sure to find something that you
like in prices ranging from less than $100 to $700
or more. If you want to be really unique, you can
buy a white helmet in a style you like and then
have it custom-painted. This is a pricey option,
ranging from $500 to $1,500 for the paint job alone,
but you’ll really like your helmet, and nobody else
in the world will have one like it. Ask a custom
bike builder in your area to steer you to a helmet
painter. Or use your favorite search engine to
browse the Internet for a custom painter.

Getting the proper fit
A helmet is the most important piece of safety equipment you can wear. And
to get the most protection, you need a helmet that fits well. After all, you
don’t want a helmet that’s too big and will twist on your head if you get in a
crash. And you don’t want a helmet that’s so tight and uncomfortable that
you won’t wear it as often as you should.
No matter what size head you have, you’ll find a helmet that will fit you well.
To get a proper fit, you should do the following:
1. Get a cloth tape measure and measure the circumference of your head
at just about the level of your eyebrows.
Use a tape measure that measures in centimeters because that knowl-
edge is crucial for a good fit.
2. After you know your size, look for a label inside the helmet that tells
the size, such as XS, S, M, L, XL, or XXL.
Remember that a medium helmet made by one manufacturer could be
the same size as a large one that’s made by another manufacturer. This
is where you use the notes you jotted down about the circumference 
of your head in centimeters (see Step 1). Besides using the S/M/L desig-
nations, most helmet manufacturers give the size in centimeters. For
example, an L may also say 59–60 cm.
3. Try on a lot of different helmets, even different helmets made by the
same manufacturer.
Different helmet brands and even different models within the same
brand can have different shapes and can fit differently.
4. Feel for pressure points.
Some riders complain that certain helmets put too much pressure on
their foreheads, so be on the lookout for this feel in a helmet. Other
riders may believe the padding in the cheek area is way too tight. You
want a snug fit, but not a painful one.
Some manufacturers offer different-sized padding for the inside of their
helmets so you can customize your fit if the ear or cheek paddings are
too tight for you.
5. Put on the helmet, strap it up, and shake your head left and right and
up and down.
When you perform these movements, the helmet should stay put. Push
up on the chinbar of a full-face helmet to make sure it won’t slide up a
whole lot under pressure. Make sure you can’t roll the helmet forward
off your head. Try to get a helmet that centers your eyes in the eyeport.
80
Part II: Welcome to the Club 

Every time you buy a helmet, which should be at least every five years, go
through this process, as if you’re buying a helmet for the first time. After all,
helmet makers may have changed the sizing of their helmets in the years that
have passed.
Keeping your helmet new, and 
your scalp from itching
A helmet is a big investment, especially if you spend big money for a high-end
one. You’ll want to keep it looking shiny and new. But you don’t want to use
any harsh cleaning fluids on it. Chemicals can damage the outer shell and
even speed up the deterioration of the foam liner inside that absorbs impacts.
One problem you’ll face as a rider, especially if you ride at night, is bugs. 
Very small bugs can pose a very big problem. Why? The carcasses dry up and
get hard while you ride, and if you don’t take care in how you get them off,
you could end up scratching your helmet or faceshield.
The best way to get bugs off your helmet is to first place a wet cotton cloth
or towel on the front of your helmet for 15 minutes or so. This softens the
hard bodies of the bugs and makes them easy to get off. In a pinch, a wet
paper towel will work.
To clean the outer shell of the helmet, it’s best to use a mild detergent, 
like dishwashing soap. To clean the faceshield, pick up a cleaning product 
at your bike shop made specifically for that purpose. When the shell and
faceshield are clean, you can use a bit of automotive wax to give the shell 
a protective coat.
81
Chapter 5: Dress for Success
Is a $700 helmet worth it?
You want the best protection you can get for
your head, but that doesn’t mean you have to
shell out big bucks for a helmet. For a helmet to
be legally sold in the United States for street or
off-road use, it must meet federal Department
of Transportation (DOT) standards. And if a
helmet meets those standards, it will have a
DOT sticker on it. So whether you spend $100 or
$700 on a helmet, it really doesn’t matter when
it comes to protection. All the helmets pass the
same tests. When you spend more money on a
helmet, you’re paying for things such as a
lighter weight, better ventilation, maybe more
comfort, better graphics, and usually a better
ability to cut wind noise. Some riders are per-
fectly happy with their $100 helmets, while
others have moved up to $500 helmets and now
will never go back. Unfortunately, there’s no
easy (meaning, inexpensive) way to try out var-
ious helmets on the road. Ask your riding pals
what they wear and why, to get an idea about
the differences in helmets.

A mild soap is also best for cleaning the inside liner of the helmet, which can
get a little, umm, ripe, if you don’t clean it occasionally. The liners of some
helmets come out, which makes cleaning easy. If your liner doesn’t come out,
first dab it with a mild detergent and then with a wet towel. Then let it dry.
Make sure your helmet liner is absolutely clean.
If you find that your helmet makes your scalp itch, you can take some steps
to try to correct that. First, make sure that your ventilation system is open so
that air is circulating through the helmet. Also try using a different shampoo.
Your shampoo could be drying out your scalp so much that if your head
sweats, it starts itching. Finally, check with a dermatologist to be sure you
don’t have some kind of skin problem. You also can consult an allergist to 
see whether you’re allergic to something in the helmet.
No, it won’t break your neck: This 
and other helmet myths busted
Faced with arguments about the safety of helmets, some motorcyclists who
don’t wear them argue that a helmet actually poses more dangers to a motor-
cyclist than riding without one. These bikers have four main arguments,
which I debunk in the following sections.
The bottom line is that there are compelling safety reasons for wearing a
helmet. But it’s your choice, unless your state has a law requiring you to 
wear one.
Argument 1: “A helmet will break my neck”
One popular argument is that if you get in a crash wearing a full-face helmet
and hit the road with the chinbar, it will snap your head back, breaking your
neck. Then, they say, the motorcyclist is left bedridden for the rest of his 
or her life. On the other hand, they say, such an impact would kill you if you
weren’t wearing a helmet, and they would rather be dead than unable to
move. Hmmm. It’s an interesting argument, but no facts can back it up.
In fact, research shows that a motorcycle rider is less likely to suffer a severe,
crippling neck injury — I’m talking about the spinal cord here — than a rider
without a helmet. Or, looking at it backward: If you ride without a helmet,
you’re more likely to suffer a crippling injury than if you wear a helmet.
Argument 2: “I can’t hear anything with a helmet on”
Helmet opponents argue that riders who wear helmets can’t hear anything
with the helmet on, such as the blaring of the siren on an approaching 
police car or ambulance, or even the sounds of nearby vehicles. Again, this 
is untrue. Yes, helmets reduce sounds — the blasting wind noise rushing by
your ears while you ride when you don’t wear a helmet is muffled signifi-
cantly, for example — but you can still hear sirens, cars and trucks, and 
82
Part II: Welcome to the Club 

even people yelling at you. Helmets protect you from the possibly damaging
whistling wind noise as well as other loud noises you may encounter on 
your rides.
Argument 3: “A helmet reduces my peripheral vision”
Helmet haters often say that a helmet reduces peripheral vision. They say
that they need every advantage they can get to see car drivers and other 
dangers approaching from the side while they’re riding. Well, guess what?
Research again shows that a helmet doesn’t reduce peripheral vision. In fact,
remember those DOT safety standards discussed earlier in this chapter?
Those standards require that a helmet allow for 210 degrees of peripheral
vision, which is about the peripheral vision that the average person has.
Argument 4: “Helmet laws don’t save lives”
A common argument is that more motorcyclists die in states that require 
helmets than in states that don’t require helmets. You can’t compare one
state with another to argue that more motorcyclists wearing helmets die on
the road; the comparison needs to be made in the same state because you
need to compare the number of riders on the road. And the fact is, normally
when a state that required riders to wear helmets repeals the mandatory
helmet law, motorcyclist deaths go up. Plus, motorcyclists don’t just die 
from head injuries; they can also die from internal injuries.
Motorcycle Jackets: Looking Cool 
While Staying Protected
The way the story goes, motorcyclists used to always wear black leather
jackets because, besides gaining wearable protection, motorcyclists could
take off their jackets and throw them on the ground when they were working
on their broken-down bikes alongside the road. The bikers wouldn’t get dirty,
and the black wouldn’t show the dirt so much. Plus, grease and road grime
don’t show up as well on a black jacket.
This theory may be true, since motorcycles of yesteryear weren’t as reliable
as they are today, or it may not be true. It doesn’t really matter, though,
because today’s motorcyclist isn’t stuck with just one choice in a jacket.
Besides black leather, today’s rider can pick from leather jackets in all differ-
ent colors, including pink. They can even choose jackets made from synthetic
materials with built-in armor offering loads of protection.
So you can make a fashion statement with the jacket you wear or project
your desired image. If you want to look like a bad boy or girl, go with the
black leather. If you want to look like you just rode off the racetrack, you can
get a colorful racing-style jacket. If you want to look like you just came from a
83
Chapter 5: Dress for Success

long-distance riding trip through the desert, you can do that, too. You just
need the right jacket. Expect to pay about $130 for a basic synthetic jacket
and up to $900 or more for a custom-made leather jacket with a lot of built-in
protection and other features. Have some fun with your jacket. After all,
motorcycling is about having fun.
Old Faithful: Nothing beats 
a leather jacket
For uncompromising protection and a great feel, you can’t beat a motorcycle
jacket made of thick, competition-weight leather that’s 1.1 mm to 1.3 mm
thick. When you hold the jacket in one hand, it feels heavy, but when you
wear it, it doesn’t.
Motorcycle roadracers who circle racetracks at 180 mph or more wear one-
piece leather suits with built-in armor because they offer the most abrasion
protection. These racers fall off their bikes and go sliding off the track at high
speeds; they walk away from these crashes because sliding on the asphalt
didn’t grind away the leather.
When buying a leather jacket, it’s vital that it’s a motorcycling jacket. A fashion
jacket isn’t thick enough to protect against abrasion if you fall off your bike at
any speed.
What’s great about leather jackets besides the protection is that leather can
be dyed, so you’ll find a lot of great-looking jackets out there besides classic
black. You can spot-clean your leather jacket when it gets dirty, but eventu-
ally, to have it thoroughly cleaned, you should take it to a professional
cleaner who’s skilled in cleaning leather. You also should treat your jacket
with leather conditioner every now and then to keep it supple. Expect to 
pay $250 and up for a leather jacket.
Opting for synthetics when leather 
is too hot or too expensive
A lot of motorcyclists have a leather jacket to wear when the weather is cool
or cold, and opt for a synthetic mesh jacket when the weather is hot. Or they
have a synthetic jacket that isn’t mesh but has a lot of big pockets because
they want to be able to carry a lot of stuff.
Synthetic jackets are a lot cheaper than leather ones. So if you’re on a tight
budget, you can opt for a synthetic jacket. Synthetic jackets don’t quite offer
the abrasion protection of leather, but, hey, it’s pretty unlikely that you’ll be
sliding down the asphalt at 100 mph like a roadracer might.
84
Part II: Welcome to the Club 

Synthetics still offer good abrasion protection and have armor protection 
in key areas like the elbows and shoulders. Like leather jackets, they come 
in a variety of colors and styles. Just make sure you get one that’s made
specifically for motorcycling. Cleaning synthetic jackets is easy: Take out the
padding and throw it in the washing machine. Expect to pay $120 and up for 
a synthetic jacket.
Finding a good fit and protection
Motorcycling jackets are made for, well, motorcycling, so they have a differ-
ent fit and feel compared to jackets you normally wear. Motorcycle jackets 
for street riding need to be snug so they aren’t flapping around in the wind
and so that the armor protection in them stays put over critical areas of the
body in a crash.
Don’t get a jacket that’s too tight. You want to avoid a too tight jacket for two
reasons:
 You’ll rarely wear it because it’s uncomfortable (and a jacket can’t 
protect you unless you’re wearing it).
 Much as we all hate to admit it, most of us gain a little weight as we 
get older, so it may not fit after a few months or years.
Besides being snug, a motorcycle jacket has longer arms than a regular
jacket. Why? When you’re on your bike and are reaching out in front of you 
to hold the handlebars, you need that extra sleeve length to keep your wrists
protected. A motorcycle jacket is also designed so that it won’t get tight
around your shoulders as you reach for the handlebars.
Most motorcycle jackets have zippers at the wrists so you can snug up the
lower part of the sleeve after you put on your jacket. The pockets also have
zippers so that the stuff you have in there doesn’t fall out while you ride. And
there’s usually an inside breast pocket and a breathable liner. Some leather
jackets also have zippered vents so you can let air in while you ride. Many
synthetic jackets are made of a mesh to keep you cool.
Motorcycle jackets vary in the level of extra protection they offer, and your
riding style dictates how much protection you need. For example, if you’re a
cruiser rider, you can wear a leather jacket that just has an extra layer of
padding in key areas: the shoulders and elbows. Or, as a rider of any
machine, you may want to opt for a leather or synthetic jacket that also has
padding in the shoulders and elbows. If you ride a sportbike, you’ll want to
consider a jacket that has hard armor in those key areas, which is padding
with a hard shell.
The more protection you get, the better off you are, but adding protection
also adds cost, especially if you have your jacket custom made. But it’s a
85
Chapter 5: Dress for Success

worthwhile investment, especially considering that your jacket will last you
many, many years — unless, of course, you gain weight and can’t fit into it
anymore.
Boots Aren’t Just for Cowboys
Often riders don’t give enough thought to their riding boots. Different boots
are made for different riding styles — cruiser, touring, sportbike — so it’s
important to pick the right boot.
Some riders just pick up a cheap pair of work boots or even combat boots to
ride in. Well, that foot wear is better than flip-flops, but it really isn’t the best
choice for motorcycle riding. Motorcycle boots are specifically made to 
provide protection in the event of a crash. They also help to keep you from
slipping when you put your feet down at stoplights and to make it easier to
move your feet around on the bike’s footpegs.
Good motorcycle boots aren’t cheap. You can expect to pay from $100 to
$350 or more. But these boots are well worth it and will last for many years.
Plus, if you really like the boots, you sometimes can have them repaired
when the soles wear out or you scrape up the protection mounted on the
sides or back of the boots.
If you have a great idea for boot graphics or you just want boots that fit 
perfectly, consider buying custom boots. Expect to pay $450 or more.
Determining the important 
fits and features
Your riding style determines the features you need in a boot. Cruiser riders,
for example, need fewer safety features than a sportbike rider. You’ll find a lot
of different boots out there, and if they’re made for motorcycling, you’ll know
that they’ll at least meet your basic needs.
Many cruiser riders opt for a black or brown engineer-type boot or a lace-up
work-type boot. You can get these boots “off the rack” or custom made. A
basic boot has a hard toe and nonslip sole. Boots with more features may
have an extra layer of leather where the boot manipulates the shifter as well
as padding or other protection around the ankles and heels.
For a sportbike rider, a sport/roadracing boot is the way to go. These boots
are lightweight and are designed for easy movement on the footpegs as well as
for feel of the shift and brake levers. The heels are low, the soles are relatively
flat, and you get hard protection in the toes, ankles, heels, and elsewhere.
86
Part II: Welcome to the Club 

A motorcycle boot should be snug, but it shouldn’t be so tight that it’s
uncomfortable. It should be comfortable for walking as well as riding. Some
new riders need a little time to get used to the tightness around the ankle
caused by built-in ankle protection. If you’re uncomfortable in a really snug
boot, get one that’s a little looser. Just make sure the boot isn’t so big that
your foot can move in it, giving you blisters on your heel.
A lot of motorcycling boots are made in Europe, so they come in European
sizes. For example, a European 45 is an American men’s 10.5, and a European
45.5 is an American 11. But sizing differs among various manufacturers, so
one boot maker’s 45 may, in fact, be equivalent to an American 11 instead of
10.5. In fact, sizes vary among manufacturers even in American sizes. You
may find that you wear a 10.5 boot from one maker and an 11 from another.
Before you buy, actually go to a store and try on the boots, or make sure you
can return them if you mail-order them and they don’t fit.
Protection: Not all boots are created equal
A lot of boots out there offer various levels of protection. Your best bet is to
get the most protection you can afford. For example, at a minimum, the boots
should be water resistant so that your feet won’t get wet in the rain. For more
money, you can opt for a waterproof boot, which will let you ride through 
a deluge or walk through 6 inches of water without getting your feet wet.
Keeping your dogs dry is important for your own comfort and for the sheer
enjoyment of motorcycling. And, of course, it’s important so you can safely
operate your machine.
Also, at a minimum, a motorcycle boot should have a nonslip sole and a hard
toe. The boot may offer other levels of protection, such as padding or hard
armor around the ankle and heels and on the shin; it’s up to you to decide
what you need.
Sport/roadrace boots also feature toe sliders on the outer edge of the toes 
so that if the rider touches that part of the boot to the asphalt while taking 
a corner, the asphalt won’t grind away the boot. Good boots also feature 
protection, usually hard armor, for the Achilles heel.
Caring for your boots
Take care of your boots, and they’ll last you a long time. To clean them, just
wipe off the dirt with a damp cloth or sponge. Then dry them with a soft
cloth. If your boots have any plastic parts on the outside that are articulated,
you can use a silicone lubricant on them to make them stop squeaking. Don’t
use any harsh cleaners; otherwise you may wreck those protective parts.
87
Chapter 5: Dress for Success

Store your boots in a well-ventilated area, and stuff them with newspaper
over the winter so they maintain their shape. If your boots get wet — and
there will be days they will — dry them with a cloth as best you can and 
then leave them in a well-ventilated area away from direct sunlight to dry.
Covering Your Legs: The Right 
Pants Are Important
Most riders ignore picking up a pair of motorcycle riding pants and, instead,
opt to ride in blue jeans. Big mistake. Riding pants are important because of
the abrasion protection they offer in a crash. Imagine sliding down the road
on your butt in blue jeans: Your flesh would look like hamburger in seconds.
If you want the right image, you need to match your riding pants with your
riding jacket. If you wear a black leather jacket, then black leather pants or
chaps are the way to go. If you wear a synthetic jacket, then synthetic 
pants would look best. In either case, you can get blue or black jeans made
specifically for motorcycling that would work well.
It may seem like a hassle to have to put on special pants for motorcycling,
but, hey, nobody said motorcycling is easy. And riders aren’t dressing for 
the ride as much as they’re dressing for the possibility of a crash.
Leather pants: Great protection made sexy
For the same reason that leather makes for great riding jackets, it makes for
great riding pants. Leather offers great abrasion protection. Plus, leather
pants look great on both men and women because, for motorcycling, you
need a snug fit.
You don’t need competition-weight leather for pants because the impact
areas in a crash are the knees, hips, and less likely, the butt, which should
have padding or other protection. But you do need something thicker than
the leather pants you’ll find at a fashion shop. With motorcycling-specific
leather pants, you get more than a good fit for riding. The seams also should
have a very strong nylon or other material thread and, even better, be
double-stitched so the seams don’t explode when the pants hit the pavement
in a crash.
Leather riding pants basically come in two different styles: a blue jean-type
style for cruising and touring riders, and a roadrace style for sportbike
riders. The blue jean-style pants usually don’t have any extra protection, but
88
Part II: Welcome to the Club 

roadrace-style pants have tons. They have extra leather and padding, and
maybe even hard armor, in the hips and knees. They may have knee sliders,
which are hard plastic pucks that hook to the sides of the knees with hook-
and-loop fasteners so you can touch a knee to the asphalt in a turn without
grinding away leather. The pants also may have zippers at the end of the 
leg for a snug fit.
Roadrace-style pants may even have elastic panels in the crotch and back to
allow for easy movement on the motorcycle. They come in a variety of colors,
and you can even find jackets with matching pants.
If you can’t find pants you want off the rack, or if you’re hard to fit, consider
getting custom leather pants in either style. It’s pricey, but you’ll know 
your pants will fit perfectly and have all the pockets, protection, and other
features you want.
Leather overpants, which are pricey but convenient, are also available. They
are leather pants with zippers all the way up the sides of the legs so that 
you can wear these pants over your regular pants. Overpants are great for
commuting to work on a motorcycle: When you get to work, you just take
them off and, voilà! No unsightly bug stains on your pants! Price? About 
$300 to $400.
Chaps: The cool alternative 
to leather pants
Black or brown leather motorcycling chaps are extremely popular with the
cruiser crowd. Chaps are cheaper than leather pants, aren’t as hot, are easy
to put on, and still look way cool on men and women.
Chaps are so popular that you can usually find vendors at motorcycling 
rallies selling them at relatively cheap prices.
Examine chaps carefully before buying, or they may protect you only slightly
better than blue jeans would. Check the buckle construction to make sure 
it’s well attached and won’t fall apart. Make sure the leather is of a decent
thickness, and check the stitching to make sure it’s stitched with a strong
nylon and, even better, double-stitched.
Good chaps will cost around $200 or more, but will offer good abrasion 
protection in all key areas except your bottom.
89
Chapter 5: Dress for Success

Synthetic pants and blue jeans
Some riders find leather to be too hot to ride in. Fortunately, some alterna-
tives offer good protection, including synthetic pants, and blue and black
jeans made specifically for motorcycling.
Synthetic motorcycling pants are abrasion resistant, although not as much as
leather, and come in a regular pants style or a sportrider style. You also can
get synthetic overpants. Generally, synthetic pants offer padding or armor in
the knees and hips, which are impact areas in a crash, and may have stretch
panels for ease of movement on a bike. They cost about $200 or more.
Some companies also make blue and black jeans specifically for motorcy-
cling. These pants have extra protection in impact areas and are made to 
be abrasion resistant. Plus, they offer a little extra room in the crotch, for
ease of movement on a bike. They cost about $60 and up.
Gloves: Style and Protection 
in One Neat Package
Good gloves are very important for a motorcyclist’s safety, not only because
they protect the rider’s hands in the event of a fall, but also because they
offer protection against bugs and stones kicked up by truck tires on the 
freeway. They also provide some protection in bad weather. Expect to pay
$60 to $350 for gloves, depending on the style and features.
Surveying the different styles
Motorcycle gloves have precurved fingers to fit comfortably around the
motorcycle’s handgrips. Most times they also have padding on the back 
of the hand and along the little finger to provide protection in a crash.
You’ll find many gloves on the market. Consider the following:
 The motorcycling glove that offers almost no protection and that, 
fortunately, isn’t very popular, is the fingerless glove. This glove would
protect the palm of your hand in a get-off, but that’s about it.
 The next level up in protection is a full leather glove, like a workman’s
glove. This style will help protect against stones and rocks while riding
and abrasions during a crash (as long as the leather is thick enough and
the stitching is strong enough that the glove doesn’t explode on impact).
90
Part II: Welcome to the Club 

 Another style of glove is a regular leather motorcycling glove. This type of
glove is made to be snug and offers various levels of protection, ranging
from extra leather on the palm to extra leather and padding on the palm,
the knuckles, the outside of the little fingers, along the edge of the hand,
and maybe even along the tops of the fingers — all possible impact
areas in a crash.
 High-zoot sport-riding or roadracing gloves fit tight and have padding and
even hard armor just about everywhere. These gloves also have a long
gauntlet so they fit easily over the sleeve of a motorcycle jacket, a strap
to make the glove snug around the wrist, and even a ventilation system,
if you want it. These gloves come in many different colors.
You can also find special gloves for warm-weather riding, cool-weather riding,
and even cold-weather riding. (Yes, some motorcyclists do ride even when
there’s snow on the ground.) Whatever you put on, just remember that any
motorcycle glove is better than no glove at all.
Tips for trying out gloves
A large glove made by one manufacturer may be an extra large made by
another manufacturer, so be sure to try on the gloves before you buy them.
They should fit snugly so they don’t come off in a crash, but they should still
be comfortable enough that you’ll wear them when you ride. When trying 
on gloves, make sure that none of the stitching cuts into your hand anywhere
and that any hard armor doesn’t press painfully on any pressure points.
Whether you’re buying a synthetic glove or a leather glove, make sure that
it’s well constructed, with strong stitching, and that it has the protective 
features you want. Consider buying different gloves for different seasons.
After all, you can’t control your motorcycle well if your hands are numb; 
likewise, hot and sweaty hands can pose a danger for control.
91
Chapter 5: Dress for Success
Ridin’ in the rain
Every motorcyclist should have a good set of
rain gear, which is a rain suit that goes over your
riding clothes. You never know when you may
need to ride through heavy rain to get some-
where. A rain suit will keep you comfortable,
warm, and dry, making your ride safer. You can
get either a one-piece or a two-piece rain suit
starting at around $60. Rain suits are usually
made of nylon. Try to stay away from plastic or
PVC suits because they don’t breathe well,
meaning you can overheat in them. Try the 
rain suit on in the store over the gear you’ll be
wearing when you ride to make sure it fits and
doesn’t become too tight in a riding position.

 Connecting with other female motorcyclists
M
otorcycling has traditionally been a man’s sport, but more women 
are deciding they don’t want to take a back seat to any man and are
learning to ride their own bikes.
Granted, riding on the back of a bike through the countryside with a signifi-
cant other can be a lot of fun, but being in control of the machine yourself is
even more fun. Just ask any of the 10 percent of the approximately 6 million
female motorcyclists on the road today or any of the female roadracers,
motocrossers, and other motorcycle racing competitors.
The face of motorcycling is definitely changing. Today when a couple walks
into a motorcycle dealership, smart salespeople don’t automatically assume
that the guy, not the gal, wants to buy a bike. The motorcycle manufacturers
acknowledge the growth in female riders and are now designing more gear
and holding more events specifically for women. And you’ll be surprised by
how many famous women ride motorcycles, including actresses Angelina
Jolie, Catherine Bell, Kate Hudson, and Jessica Alba; TV personality Mary
Hart also rides.
In this chapter, you get tips on how to gain acceptance by your motorcycling
brethren, find the right jacket and other gear to fit your body, adjust your
machine for a comfortable and safe fit, and get in touch with other female
motorcyclists to share secrets of the women’s motorcycling world.

Getting the Respect You Deserve
Motorcycle safety instructors will tell you that women are the best students
and learners. Why? Women usually don’t come into the courses with any-
thing to prove. They have no macho image to try to uphold, and they admit,
at least to themselves, that they don’t know how to ride a motorcycle.
Because of that, women are typically attentive and eager to learn — they
aren’t just in class to get the certificate.
Now, not all men go into a motorcycle safety training class thinking they
know everything and trying to uphold a macho image. But many do. And
those men are the Neanderthals who give women a hard time when they
become riders. Why do they do that? They’re probably afraid women are
better riders than they are!
In some motorcycling circles, guys still call women by derogatory names
(you’ll even see them on T-shirts) and treat women like property. That atti-
tude is all part of the macho, bad-boy image those guys are trying to portray.
You obviously don’t have to stand for it. Let people in your riding group 
know you won’t tolerate it. Or, if you want to, find yourself a group that’s
more open-minded about female riders. It’s really easy to do.
Fortunately, jerks aren’t any more common in the motorcycling world than
they are in the regular world, which means that most fellow motorcyclists
will treat you great. In fact, just being a woman who rides gains you more
respect from guys than a new male rider gets initially. A man has to prove
himself among the other riders before he can gain respect. (I know, it’s that
stupid macho thing again.) But women get instant respect just by climbing 
on and grabbing the controls of a bike.
You’ll lose that respect immediately, though, if you don’t know the difference
between a cruiser and a sportbike, or if you hop on your bike and then make
a beeline right into the side of a parked car. Each motorcycling subgroup has
its own way of thinking (which I explain in Chapter 4), but all motorcyclists
talk about some common things, so you need to learn those basics first.
When you understand the basics, just hanging around motorcyclists will help
you pick up more motorcycling knowledge and gain you even more respect.
Do what bikers do, and know the lingo
You don’t need a tattoo to fit in with a biker crowd, but you do need to do
what your crowd does and know the lingo. Otherwise you may be labeled as
a “wannabe” motorcyclist. But don’t worry; the following sections give you
some ideas of how to fit in with the crowd.
94
Part II: Welcome to the Club 

Walking the walk (or riding the ride)
Does your crowd like to take part in organized rides to raise money for char-
ity? Go on some of those rides. Do group members hang out at Bike Nights? 
If so, check them out. Maybe they like to plan daylong rides on Saturdays 
or Sundays. Go along. Obviously you don’t have to go on every single ride
your group puts together (though it’s perfectly fine if you want to). But you
do need to show up now and then to show that you are a rider, not a poser 
or wannabe.
The more you go to these group events, the more you’ll be hanging around
motorcyclists. And the more you hang around motorcyclists, the more you’ll
learn about motorcycling.
Talking the talk
Initially, you’ll likely do a lot of listening when other riders talk about tires,
bike modifications, new machines, and tough riding situations that they were
able to get out of. But, eventually, you’ll learn enough to be able to join the
discussions and offer insights of your own.
Here’s just one example of what motorcyclists like to talk about: tires. They
love delving into this topic. For instance, they’ll look at someone’s tires and
note that they are sport or “sticky” tires, meaning that the rubber is soft 
and provides a better grip on the road. But they’ll also note that the life of a
sticky tire isn’t very long.
Or they may peg a tire as a touring tire, meaning that the rubber is hard 
and doesn’t have the extreme grip of a sport tire. And, of course, they’ll com-
ment on the long life of the touring tire. You may also hear riders talk of
sport-touring tires, which are a compromise between sport and touring 
tires. Motorcyclists also look at the wear on a biker’s tire to see how leaned
over the motorcyclist has had the bike on the road, meaning how fast the
motorcyclist has taken corners. They may even comment on whether it’s
time to change the tire.
“How do you like those tires?” is a pretty common question among bikers
because you’ll find differences in tires among different manufacturers. This 
is when the talk may get a little more detailed: Riders may say the front tire
“steers heavy,” meaning it takes some effort to turn the bike, or they may say
the tread pattern makes the bike really wobble when riding over rain grooves
in the road.
All this is the type of knowledge that you need to tuck away in the back of
your brain — not only so you can talk about tires, but also so you have a
wealth of knowledge about different tires and how they work in the real world
when it comes time to buy your next set.
95
Chapter 6: Leather and Lace: Women in Motorcycling

In fact, if you want to learn anything, just ask a rider, “Do you like . . . .” A
thoughtful motorcyclist will give you an answer chock-full of information.
After hearing the answer, you’ll be able to talk about that subject and also file
away that knowledge for later. Consider this example of the question you may
ask and some answers you may get. “Do you like that . . .”
 Helmet: “I like it a lot. It fits great, although it was a little tight at first. 
It feels light, the venting works great so it keeps me cool in the summer,
and you can get a lot of different tinted faceshields for it. It’s expensive,
though — maybe around $500.”
 Seat: “This seat isn’t the stock seat. That one was too hard. I bought 
this one at (company name), and it has a lot more padding. Plus, it’s a
little wider than stock, so it’s a lot better for the long haul.”
 Style of gloves: “They’re a little hot, but they fit well and offer some
extra protection, with another layer of leather on the fingers and 
palms. They were cheap. I need to buy some vented ones for summer
riding, though.”
 Tire: “This type of tire is pretty good, but it’s a little slippery in the rain.
And I didn’t get as many miles out of it as I thought I would. I’ll probably
get a more expensive tire when I replace it.”
Besides talking about equipment and gear, motorcyclists talk about roads
and riding. They talk about nice roads with long sweepers, which are long,
flowing turns; tight hairpins, which are turns that turn back on themselves;
and tight corners, which are, well, tight corners. Sportbike riders talk about
“taking a line through a turn” and “hitting the apex.” The apex is the tightest
point in a curve. Check out Appendix A for more of the basic biker lingo.
You’ll pick up more knowledge as you hang around motorcyclists. Just
remember, to be a motorcyclist, you really do need to know the lingo. Plus,
it’s fun to speak a language that most people on the road find foreign.
Ride, ride, ride
The best way to get respect from fellow motorcyclists, even if you don’t know
much of the lingo, is to ride. Motorcyclists respect riders. Put a lot of miles
on your bike. Not only will you gain respect when fellow riders sneak a peek
at your odometer, but the more you ride, the better a rider you’ll become.
You’ll always be using your skills and improving. It doesn’t matter where 
you ride or whether it’s with a group or alone — what matters is that you do
ride. By the way, in case you didn’t know, being called a “wannabe” or a
“poser” is an insult.
96
Part II: Welcome to the Club 

Long-distance rides also gain you a lot of respect. If you can tell tales of riding
from Missouri to Daytona Beach, Florida, or from Minnesota to Colorado,
you’ll be right up there with the experienced riders in your crowd.
One more thing: Don’t let worry over dropping your bike in front of others
stop you from riding. Motorcyclists get off balance and drop motorcycles.
Let’s face it, bikes have two wheels, not four, so they can be heavy and unsta-
ble when they aren’t moving. Sure, it’s embarrassing to drop a motorcycle 
in a parking lot, but it happens. If you drop your bike, you may take some
good-natured ribbing over it, but other riders won’t have any less respect for
you. Chances are extremely good that they’ve done the same themselves.
Curves Ahead: Finding Gear That Fits
Not too long ago, women had to settle for guys’ motorcycling clothes in 
small sizes if they wanted to be safe on a bike. But the jackets never fit quite
right, for obvious reasons, and even the gloves many times were too long in
the fingers. And leather pants? You could pretty much forget about finding a
pair that fit in the hips. Chaps were pretty easy to find — just don’t fall on
your butt!
Thankfully, women now have choices in their own riding gear. Granted, it’s
not the wide variety that men enjoy when shopping for protective gear. But
nowadays manufacturers make jackets, pants, and boots especially for
women, and in different styles.
If you want to go for the tough biker-chick look, you can do it. If you want 
a very feminine look, you can get that, too. And, of course, you can achieve
some middle ground: good-looking, cut-for-a-woman protective gear with 
just a hint that it was made for a girl, like a single rose on the side of a boot.
Some companies even make dirt bike riding jerseys and pants specifically 
for women.
Don’t expect to be able to march down to your local motorcycle dealer and
pick a jacket off the rack. You may be able to do that at a mega-motorcycle
accessories store, but you may have to travel a ways to get to a store like
that. (But just think, this gives you another excuse to ride your bike!) With a
little perseverance, though, you’ll find riding gear that offers protection in 
a style you like. Best of all, it will fit. Motorcycle rallies where thousands of
motorcyclists gather to have a good time also have vendors selling every-
thing from helmets to jackets to pants. Women’s sizes and styles are always
available there. (I describe various rallies in Chapter 16.)
97
Chapter 6: Leather and Lace: Women in Motorcycling

If you’re a woman with a body shape that is difficult to fit with gear off the
rack, you can still get great jackets, pants, and boots. Do what hard-to-fit men
do: Have them custom made. In fact, if you can afford it, I recommend that
you get a custom-made jacket anyway. (I recommend that for men also.) A
custom-made jacket gives you a perfect fit, the style and colors you want, and
all the features you’re looking for — well, all that you can afford, anyway.
My favorite jacket is a custom one with lots of built-in armor that I had made
more than ten years ago. (I had the foresight to ask the maker to add a couple
extra inches in the tummy to allow for growth.) The cost at the time? $950.
But, hey, I’m still wearing it. So that figure works out to be less than $95 a
year for a jacket with protection that equals that of professional motorcycle
roadracers’ jackets.
Jackets, pants, and helmets 
just for women
The motorcycling industry sees a great opportunity with the influx of women
into the sport. Fortunately this means that women now can find a wide 
variety of safety gear that not only offers protection but fits well and looks
great. In fact, some jackets look so good that you may want to wear them
casually, even when you aren’t on a motorcycle.
Okay, you may look great in a designer leather jacket and figure you’ll just
buy that for when you ride. Or you may really like your tall leather boots that
you wear for a night on the town, so you figure that you don’t need to buy a
new pair for riding your bike. Forget it. The leather on a designer jacket is too
thin, the stitching is too weak, and it will probably shred and the seams will
burst if you fall off your bike. Ouch! And the boots won’t offer the foot and
ankle support and protection you need for riding a bike. Plus you won’t have
a good sole for gripping the road when you stop at slippery intersections 
for stoplights.
When you’re looking for motorcycling gear, think safety first and style
second. Good motorcycling gear is made to protect you in case of a crash.
You should be able to find gear that offers protection, comfort, and style all
in one package. And some inexpensive gear will do the job of protecting 
you, but don’t skimp. If you aren’t happy with your gear, you won’t wear it.
And if you won’t wear it, you won’t have the protection you need. Go ahead,
splurge — get the gear you want. You’ll feel good riding in it, and you’ll be
happy you got it if you do get in a crash.
Jacket
If you shop around, you’ll find jackets in those sizes that perplex men, such
as 0, 2, 4–6, 16–18, and 24–26. The manufacturer may give those sizes or may
98
Part II: Welcome to the Club 

list the sizes as women’s XS, S, M, L, XL, and so on, with a sizing chart that
gives the equivalent in the numeric sizes such as 0, 2, 4, 6, and so on.
The manufacturer may even give more information, like bust size, hip size,
arm length, and more, in inches. This helps you compare measurements; 
one manufacturer’s L may be another’s M. So shop around to make sure you
get a good fit.
It’s best that you go to stores and try jackets on. But if you don’t find one you
like, consider ordering by mail. (I discuss this later in this chapter.) If you 
go that route, however, consider calling the manufacturer and giving the
operator your measurements. He or she can then tell you what size to buy.
Your jacket, in particular, should fit well. Why? Because your jacket should
have extra padding or even armor in critical areas, like the elbows. You want
a good fit so that the protection doesn’t twist around your arm in a crash,
leaving your elbow unprotected. You also want a good fit around the waist or
hips so that the jacket doesn’t ride up in a crash, exposing your lower back to
the road. The wrists of your jacket should be snug — and they usually are
with the help of a zipper on each wrist — so that the sleeve doesn’t ride up in
a crash and expose your lower arm to abrasion. (I give more tips on what to
look for in good riding gear in Chapter 5.)
You aren’t stuck with buying a black, police-style motorcycle jacket. Women’s
jackets come in black, white, and even pink. You can even find a variety of
styles, including jackets with collars, jackets with fringe, or even a real tight-
fitting roadracer style jacket. Plus, you can find synthetic jackets that offer a
lot of protection. The key is to get a jacket that fits well and offers as much
protection, such as built-in armor, as you can afford.
Pants
Good riding pants for women are harder to find, but they’re out there. If
you’re a Harley-Davidson rider or you run with a cruiser crowd, consider 
getting leather chaps. They look way cool and fit in with the cruiser crowd. 
In fact, Harley-Davidson embraces women riders and offers a wide variety 
of gear for women.
If chaps aren’t your thing, you want leather or synthetic pants, or even 
reinforced blue or black jeans made specifically for riding. Those jeans have
Kevlar, the stuff they use to make bulletproof vests, in critical areas to offer
protection against punctures and abrasion.
Again, you don’t have to settle for men’s sizes when it comes to riding pants.
Women’s pants come in sizes just like you’d find in a department store: 0, 2,
4, and so on. You may also find them in women’s XS, S, M, and so on down 
the line.
99
Chapter 6: Leather and Lace: Women in Motorcycling

Boots
Manufacturers are crafting some great motorcycling boots for women these
days. Not only do these boots offer a lot of foot and ankle protection, but if
you’re short, you can even get boots that have a taller sole. This sole can
help you reach the ground when sitting still on your bike. You can get regular-
looking boots like the guys wear, or you can get something with a feminine
touch, like fringe or a rose.
Helmet
Women’s helmets are like guys’ helmets, only prettier. (I discuss the ins and
outs of helmets, and what to look for, in Chapter 5.) You can find helmets 
with graphics designed specifically to appeal to women. For example, you
can find some with pink graphics. Motorcycling is fun, so have some fun with
your helmet design. Get one with cartoon characters, if you like. Or, if you’re
willing to spend the cash, work with a custom helmet painter to design your
own one-of-a-kind helmet. Who needs a tattoo when you can design your 
own helmet?
Where to find the stuff you need
So where can you find all this cool women’s riding gear, anyway? The first
place to start is at the dealer of the manufacturer of your motorcycle. For
example, say you ride a Harley-Davidson. In that case, trot down to your local
Harley-Davidson dealer and see what the shop is selling. Harley-Davidson
knows that it doesn’t just sell motorcycles — it sells a lifestyle. So the dealers
usually have a lot of men’s and women’s riding gear for sale. Yamaha and its
Star brand of motorcycles also offer women’s gear. If the dealer doesn’t have
what you’re looking for, a salesperson probably can show you a catalog of
riding gear that you can order from.
Suppose you want a piece of gear that isn’t branded with the manufacturer’s
name on it. Expand your search. Try to find a large motorcycle accessory
store near you that offers a wide variety of women’s riding gear from different
manufacturers. Try on what you like, and then buy it.
If you can’t find what you want at a dealer and don’t have a motorcycling
megastore near you, it’s time for you to turn to the Internet. Just type some-
thing like “women’s motorcycling clothes” into your search engine. You’ll 
find links to cool stuff to buy (although do know that some of it you can 
purchase only through your local motorcycle accessories shop). Some of the
companies that sell women’s riding clothes include Firstgear, Tourmaster,
Arlen Ness, and Icon.
You want a custom paint job for your helmet? Go to the Internet and search
for custom helmet painters. You’ll find a lot of good ones out there, and you
can find examples of their work online, along with prices and other details.
100
Part II: Welcome to the Club 

If you buy gear online, make sure you know the return policy before you buy.
You must be able to return your gear if it doesn’t fit. As I said earlier, one
manufacturer’s large size may equal another manufacturer’s medium size.
Finally, ask your girlfriends who ride where they got their riding gear. You
may be surprised to learn that your friend got her cool Harley-Davidson
boots at a local store.
How Low Can You Go? 
Making a Bike Fit You
After you have riding gear that fits, you need to make sure that your bike fits
you, too. Guys have to make adjustments to their bikes to make them fit also,
but usually not to the extreme that some women do. Because women are 
generally shorter than men, they need to either buy smaller bikes or lower
their bikes so they can plant their feet as firmly on the ground as possible. 
(I discuss small bikes that may not need to be adjusted for smaller people in
Chapter 8.)
Safety, after all, comes first in motorcycling. And you’re not safe if you’re 
on a machine that doesn’t fit you. As a rider, you have enough to worry 
about (cars, deer, and other hazards). So you shouldn’t have to worry about
whether you can comfortably touch the ground with your boots at a stoplight
or reach the gearshift lever with your feet. Taking the time to set up your
machine properly will make riding a lot more fun.
Tricks to lower your machine
If you absolutely adore a machine that’s a bit too big for you, don’t worry.
You can lower the machine (referred to as lowering the ride height) three-
quarters of an inch or an inch — or even more. Lowering the bike just an 
inch can make a big difference for getting on and off the machine and keeping
101
Chapter 6: Leather and Lace: Women in Motorcycling
What about clothing for playin’ in the dirt?
If you’ve decided that you aren’t a street rider,
but you instead like to play in the dirt, you’re in
good shape when it comes to riding gear. Fox
Racing and THOR, two famous names in
motocross gear, are among the companies that
make pants, jerseys, and even boots for women
as well as for men. New companies, like the
Girlyz Clothing Company, also make motocross
gear specifically for women. Shop around and
you’ll find what you like.

the bike comfortably in control at stoplights. Nothing else is much more
embarrassing than pulling up to a stoplight and having the bike tip over
because your legs aren’t long enough to reach the ground.
Starting with the seat
A simple place to start when tackling the task of lowering your machine to
make it fit you is with the seat. If you have a well-padded seat, you can take
off the seat cover and trim some of the foam. The electric carving knife that
you use to carve a turkey works great for this. You may be able to shave an
inch or two off the seat height this way. The tradeoff, of course, is a harder
seat when you’re riding.
Another option is to get a custom seat that gives your bike a lower seat
height. Custom seat companies like Corbin (www.corbin.com; 800-538-7035)
Mustang (www.mustangseats.com; 800-243-1392), or Sargent (www.
sargentcycle.com; 800-749-7328) can offer you some options. Check 
out seat manufacturers’ Web sites, or give them a call and ask about their
selection. However, do know that custom seating isn’t cheap.
For example, a Corbin Gunfighter seat for a 2008 Harley-Davidson FXSTC
Softail Custom costs $369. The seat height on a stock Softail Custom is 28.3
inches, or 26.4 inches laden, which means with a 180-pound rider sitting on
the bike. Harley-Davidson is the only company that gives two seat heights 
for its bikes, laden and unladen, which means with no rider on the bike. The
Gunfighter seat gives the Softail Custom a seat height of 26 inches unladen.
Moving on to the suspension, if necessary
If you don’t want to carve up your seat foam or spend the bucks for a custom
seat, or if you opted for one of those options but need to lower the bike 
even further, it’s time to tackle the suspension — the front forks and the rear
shock or shocks.
You have to do this carefully, for a few reasons:
 Motorcycles are tight little packages, and everything is designed to work
together. So if you start messing around with the front or rear suspen-
sion, you may upset the geometry of the bike so much that it’s unsafe to
ride.
 Changing the suspension will change the handling of the bike. You may
not notice it, which is fine. But when you do make changes, be sure to
take it easy when you ride for the first time; be sure and think about how
the suspension feels.
 If you need to loosen bolts to make adjustments, it’s critical that you
tighten them back up to factory specifications. You can find these specs
in a service manual for your motorcycle. The last thing you need is for
critical bolts to fall off while you’re riding.
102
Part II: Welcome to the Club 

One trick to lower your ride height is to raise the front fork tubes in the triple
tree (which is the part that the fork tubes are clamped into) a half-inch to an
inch. This lowers the front of your bike. It also makes your bike steer more
quickly, which means it takes less effort to turn it into a corner. You can also
adjust the preload, which, simply put, is the amount of tension on your spring
in each fork tube. If you reduce the preload — that is, lessen the tension on
the spring — your bike will lower a bit when you sit on it. Your owner’s
manual shows you how to adjust the preload.
To complete the ride-height adjustment, you need to lower the rear as much
as the front, if possible. Your rear shock (or shocks, depending on what kind
of bike you have) probably has a preload adjustment. If you reduce the pre-
load or tension — your owner’s manual shows you how — you lower the
bike’s rear when you sit on it. If your rear shock doesn’t have preload 
adjustment, or if you want to lower the rear end more, consider new shocks
built for your bike that aren’t as long as the stock shock.
This work isn’t as complicated as it seems, but if you’re uncomfortable 
doing the work yourself, take the bike to a mechanic who can do the job. 
If you really want it done right, take your bike to a shop that specializes in
motorcycle suspension. They’ll not only lower your bike, but they’ll tune
your suspension to your riding style and you’ll have one sweet ride. This 
isn’t cheap, though. Call around.
If you try these adjustments and motorcycling-specific boots with higher-
than-normal heels, and the bike is still too tall for you, you need a 
different bike.
Adjusting or modifying your controls
After you’ve adjusted your machine so that you can sit on it with both feet
firmly planted on the ground (or close to it), you can tackle the controls: 
the shift lever, brake levers, and clutch lever.
Shift lever
The shift lever is the lever on your motorcycle that you tap with your left 
foot to put the bike into gear or to change gears. You may find that your foot
is too small to reach the end of the shift lever to operate it correctly, or you
may need to move your foot a long way to move the lever to change gears.
If you have a small foot, you can shorten the lever by having an inch or so cut
out of it and then welded back together. It may not be pretty, but it will work.
Or maybe your local dealer can recommend a shorter lever from another bike
that will bolt onto yours.
103
Chapter 6: Leather and Lace: Women in Motorcycling

If, while you’re riding, you find yourself accidentally kicking your shift lever
and putting your bike in neutral as a result, or you find that you have to lift
your foot a long way to change gears, consider adjusting your lever down.
This fix is simple. The lever is held on with a bolt. Take out the bolt, pull the
lever off the splined rod that it is attached to, and then put the lever back on
at an angle that you think will work for you. Then just retighten the bolt.
The bike also may have an adjustable rod that connects the lever to the
transmission, so you may need to make an adjustment to that rod. Ride the
bike around and see if that works. If not, repeat the process. You may need to
repeat this process several times to get an angle to the lever you’re comfort-
able with. Eventually, you’ll find a shift-lever angle you’re comfortable with.
Brake and clutch levers
If the brake and clutch levers on the handlebars are too far out for you —
that is, if your fingers won’t reach around them comfortably — you need 
to pull the levers closer. To do so, you can spin the wheels on the levers and
pull the levers closer to the handlebars. If that fix doesn’t work, or if your
levers aren’t adjustable, you may need to see if you can find other lever
assemblies that will fit on your bike that have shorter distances between the
levers and the handlebars.
While you’re sitting there on your bike, you may as well adjust the levers up or
down so that they’re comfortable for you to manipulate. On most bikes two
bolts on the perch hold the lever. You can loosen these bolts so you can twist
the entire assembly on the handlebar. Note: Some bikes are constructed so
that you can’t twist the levers on the handlebars. But don’t worry; the adjust-
ment isn’t critical. It just makes the bike more comfortable to manipulate.
When your hands are on the handgrips, your fingers should lie flat on the
levers. In other words, your arm should form a straight line from the crook 
in your arm at the elbow to your fingertips. Make this adjustment to fit the
riding position you’ll be in most of the time that you’re riding (such as sitting
up rather than crouched down out of the wind). You should be able to com-
fortably put your hands on the handgrips and your fingers on the levers with
your eyes closed. Taller riders will find they need to turn the levers down or
lower the levers to get the proper fit. When you do it once, you shouldn’t
have to adjust it again. Be sure to tighten up those bolts.
Your rear brake lever that you press with your right foot should offer some
adjustment much like your shift lever.

Solidarity, Baby: Resources 
for Women Riders
Female motorcyclists, like male motorcyclists, have a lot to learn about
motorcycling and a lot of stories and information to share. The quickest and
easiest way to learn important stuff for female riders is to ride and talk with
other female riders.
Although female motorcyclists are still a minority in the male-dominated
sport, their numbers are growing daily. As a result, you’ll find more women to
talk to and pal around with, and you’ll also find more information out there
about motorcycling for female riders.
The motorcycle manufacturers also recognize the growing importance of
women in motorcycling and are trying to make it easier for women to get
involved in — and stay involved in — motorcycling. For example, Harley-
Davidson holds women-only events. At these events, women gather at a 
dealership and learn about bikes, riding gear, and other stuff. They also get 
to chat with other female motorcyclists. Kawasaki and Ducati let women ride
their bikes and hone their riding skills on racetracks in women-only events.
Similarly, the American Motorcyclist Association holds a popular Women &
Motorcycling conference every few years that features activities, seminars,
and rides for women.
If you take the time to get to know other female riders, join motorcycling
clubs specifically for women, take part in manufacturer-sponsored motorcy-
cling activities for women, and seek out other resources, you’ll have even
more fun as a motorcyclist. Plus, the more you support women’s motorcy-
cling groups and for-women-only activities, the stronger they will become. 
It’s a win-win situation for everyone. The following sections offer some
options for ways to get involved.
Joining a club like the Motor Maids
Joining a women’s motorcycling club is a great way to share the joy — and
sometimes frustration — of being a female motorcyclist. Not a lot of women’s
clubs are out there, but there are some, ranging from international and
national organizations to small local groups. If you hunt around, you’re sure
to find a group or two you can join.
105
Chapter 6: Leather and Lace: Women in Motorcycling

Do your homework before you join a local club. Some clubs are squeaky
clean, promote a positive and wholesome image of motorcycling, and do
charity work and a lot of riding. Others pride themselves on being bad girls’
clubs. Hey, wait a minute — this is just like the men’s clubs! (Well, except 
for the “bad girl” part.) A common denominator for all clubs, men’s and
women’s alike, is that they promote camaraderie and focus on having fun 
on motorcycles.
National and international organizations include the following:
 Motor Maids: This group is one of the greatest organizations on the
planet. Founded in 1940, this national organization is the oldest women’s
club in the United States. It’s a riding club that’s proud of its long 
history and tradition, and it’s passionate about motorcycling. Some of
the most influential woman in motorcycling are Motor Maids. This is a
riding/social club that accepts riders of all types of bikes. See
www.motormaids.org for more details.
 Women in the Wind: Although this organization isn’t as old as Motor
Maids, Women in the Wind has built up a strong, wholesome reputation
since its founding in 1979. The organization has more than 60 chapters
nationwide, and, like the Motor Maids, these gals ride. But they also do
charity work and socialize. The group accepts all types of bikes. For
more information, visit www.womeninthewind.org.
 Women on Wheels: The Women on Wheels Motorcycle Organization is
the third of the best-known women’s motorcycling groups in the United
States. Founded in 1982, Women on Wheels promotes a positive image 
of motorcycling, socializes, and supports charities. The group accepts
all types of bikes. Check out www.womenonwheels.org for more 
information.
 The Women’s International Motorcycle Association: This organi-
zation isn’t as well known, but the Women’s International Motorcycle
Association has a long history, stretching back to its founding in England
in 1950 by an American woman. The association is very active in
England and has divisions around the world, including in the United
States (although the U.S. operations are in a rebuilding mode). This
wholesome association organizes a lot of activities in Great Britain and
elsewhere, and is sure to become a force in the United States with the
proper support. The group accepts all types of bikes. See
www.wimagb.co.uk.
 Women’s Motorcyclist Foundation: This group is made up of great
riders and has a strong charitable focus, raising money for breast cancer
research. The group sponsors a lot of events for women motorcyclists 
to get together, to learn about motorcycling, and to enjoy the sport. See
www.womensmotorcyclistfoundation.org to find out more.
106
Part II: Welcome to the Club 

After these big national and international organizations are the state and
local clubs. It pays to do your homework with these groups. Some of these
clubs have names that can’t be published in a family book. Ask your motor-
cycling friends and motorcycle shops about women’s clubs, and search the
Internet — you’ll find them.
Visiting the Internet
The Internet is a great tool for motorcyclists to find out everything from how
to change your oil to how to build a full-blown racing machine. But the
Internet also has problems. For example, anyone can post anything, so not all
the information is correct. In fact, some of the information is flat-out wrong
and can be dangerous.
Also important to remember is that Web sites come and go quickly. It takes
true dedication to create and maintain a Web site. The Web sites of the
motorcycle manufacturers, big motorcycling organizations, and big motorcy-
cle accessories stores have been up a long time and probably will stay up 
as long as those companies and organizations exist. Other sites that seemed
like a great idea at the time may disappear quickly.
With that said, the following great women’s motorcycling news and informa-
tion Web sites will probably continue to operate for a long time:
 Women Riders Now (www.womenridersnow.com) is an online magazine
chock-full of motorcycling information and features for women. Some 
of the Web site’s departments include “Way to Go Girl!,” which provides
a snapshot of recent accomplishments of women riders, like setting a
land speed record; “Riding Right,” which features stories on proper
riding technique; and “Lifestyle” articles about women and their riding
adventures.
The Web site is professionally done and is updated frequently. Genevieve
Schmidt, a well-respected motojournalist, runs the site. She previously
worked in television, and besides being an avid motorcycle rider, 
she knows how to ride ATVs. Her site is current and informative; all
motorcyclists, not just women, should read it.
 Helmet Hair (www.helmethair.com) is a quarterly online magazine
that is professionally done and has great stories about women riders as
well as interviews with women who make a difference in motorcycling.
Whereas Women Riders Now may be considered more of a hard-news
type of site that tells you what’s going on in the motorcycling world,
Helmet Hair is more geared toward features and pop culture.
This site is a lot of fun to read, with features like “Favorite Female
Motorcycle Movie Scenes,” “Carole Bennett: Digital Art Revolutionary,”
and “The Mamalogues: Riding with Children.” I highly recommend it.
107
Chapter 6: Leather and Lace: Women in Motorcycling

 A newcomer in the online female motojournalism world is Women
Motorcyclists Monthly (www.womenmotorcyclistsmonthly.com). It’s
too early to tell whether this magazine will survive, but it’s off to a good
start, with an attractive layout and a good mix of stories. Its features
include articles about a female stunt rider, news about women custom
bike builders, and event coverage. The editor promises more stories
from and about regular women riders. This site also has a discussion
forum that may prove to be a great resource.
 Real Divas Ride (www.realdivas.ride.com) is a Web site run for
motorcycling women. It has some interesting stories about female
motorcyclists and clubs.
If you like your magazines printed on paper, Biker Ally magazine is a motorcy-

Enrolling in racetrack organizations 
for women
I mentioned earlier that Harley-Davidson, Kawasaki, and others hold special
events for women only. Consider taking part in other women-only events to
share the camaraderie of other female riders and to hone your skills. These
events include the following:
 Femmoto: Femmoto organizes women-only rides on racetracks in 
which women ride loaner bikes from Kawasaki, Triumph, or other manu-
facturers and sharpen their skills. Femmoto also organizes track days
when women can ride their own bikes. See www.femmoto.com for 
more details.
 Women’s Motocross Association: If you want to ride motocross, the
Women’s Motocross Association can steer you in the right direction. The
best female motocross racers in the world run in Women’s Motocross
Association events. In fact, female motocrossers from around the 
world come to compete in Women’s Motocross Association races to 
test themselves against the best. Visit www.womensmotocross

f you have a child who wants to ride, consider yourself lucky!
Motorcycling is a great family sport. It allows families to spend quality
time together; plus, when the family is out riding together, parents know
exactly where their kids are and what they’re doing. Would you rather have
your kid hanging out at the mall or motorcycle riding with you?
I’m not talking about streetbikes here; I’m talking about off-road motorcycling
for kids ages 4 to 15. These tips also apply to 16- and 17-year-olds, although
kids in this age group may want to get streetbikes. Older teens who want
streetbikes should have off-road bikes as well, to improve their riding skills.
In this chapter, you find out how to select the right bike for your child, in
terms of both the bike’s size and power characteristics. I show you how to
ensure that your youngster gets the best safety training possible and is 
properly attired in safety gear (without making you go broke). I also prepare
you for your child’s first day at the racetrack (if your child decides to go 
that route).

Finding a Bike That Fits 
Your Child’s Needs
Thinking about putting your child on a motorcycle for the first time can be 
a little scary. As the adult, you get to make the decisions, and one of the 
most important decisions you can make is picking the right machine. Kids’
bikes come in a lot of different flavors, from mild trail-riding machines to
high-strung racers meant only for experienced riders. You also find different
features on different machines that can help put your mind at ease, such as
restrictors to restrict the power and limiters to limit how far open the child
can turn the throttle, which determines how fast the child can go. True 
beginner bikes have automatic transmissions, but with other bikes the child
needs to learn how to shift gears. You can even get aftermarket training
wheels for small machines (by aftermarket, I mean from a non-motorcycle
manufacturer).
When looking for your child’s first bike, do your homework, get to know the
machines available and what they feature, and shop around. Sometimes you
can get a good deal on a child’s bike that has been sitting on a dealer’s show-
room floor for a year or two, or even three. Plus, as you know, kids grow fast.
They grow out of just about everything you buy them, and a motorcycle is no
different. So look for a used machine that another child has outgrown, and
you may find a deal. The parent really has no use for the bike, so don’t be
afraid to haggle. (I cover what to look for in a used bike and how to negotiate
a fair price in Chapter 9.)
Considering trail bikes and racers
A kid’s trail bike is an off-road motorcycle that offers more mild power 
delivery; these bikes are easier to ride than an off-road race bike. A trail bike
is the best choice for a new, young rider because it’s easy to ride and doesn’t
require a lot of maintenance like a race bike does. In fact, you can even get
beginner trail bikes with a shaft drive, whereby power is delivered to the rear
wheel through a shaft, rather than a chain drive, which delivers power with a
chain. A chain drive requires more maintenance than a shaft drive.
For younger kids
For a young child, the best way to go is a trail bike with an automatic trans-
mission, a restrictor to limit power, and a limiter to limit how far a child can
twist the throttle. The Yamaha PW50 (shown in Figure 7-1) is an example of a
trail bike for a young child. The KTM 50SX (shown in Figure 7-2) is more of a
racing machine with long suspension travel, disc brakes (as opposed to drum
brakes), and high-quality — which also means higher-cost — components.

Chapter 7: What to Do if Your Kid Wants to Ride Too

KTM North America, Inc.
An important consideration when choosing a bike is where your child will be
riding. If he or she will only be riding in your backyard, just about any bike
will do. However, you should avoid getting a race bike if you live close to
neighbors. Non-motorcyclists can find the sound of race bikes annoying
because they can be loud. And when annoyed, neighbors may complain to
government officials about the noise. This can lead to an ugly fight, not only
with your neighbors but also with City Hall. It’s not fun. Also, if you plan to
ride in national forests or in other public riding areas, your child’s bike will
probably need a spark arrester that keeps any sparks from coming out of the
exhaust system. After all, you don’t want to catch the forest on fire! The bike
also needs to meet sound limits. The exhaust pipe will be stamped with
words saying that it meets federal sound limits (if it in fact does). That info
also may be spelled out on a sticker on the frame of the motorcycle.
For older kids
An older child won’t fit on a small machine like Yamaha’s PW50, so you 
need to look at a trail bike that’s a little bigger, like an 85cc or even a 125cc
machine. Even on these bigger machines, you can find features such as 
throttle limiters, so shop around for the ones you want. Kawasaki’s KLX 110
(shown in Figure 7-3) is a good machine for young riders (or even small adult
women) to develop riding skills on.
Here are the specs for the KLX 110:

If your child has outgrown small bikes like Yamaha’s PW50 and is ready to go
the race bike route (meaning he or she has the skills to handle a more power-
ful machine with stiffer suspension), many good bikes are available with 85cc
motors. The Suzuki RM85 (shown in Figure 7-4) is a good example. This bike
also comes in an “L” designation, the RM85L, which has bigger wheels and a
longer wheelbase so that the bike fits bigger kids better.
If your child gets into 125cc race bikes, remember that they’re a handful to
ride. Make sure your child has the proper skills before jumping on one of
these thoroughbreds. The 125s are what the young professional racers race.
Here are the key specs for the Suzuki RM85:

Making sure your child fits the machine
No matter whether you decide to get a trail bike or a racer for your child,
making sure that the bike you choose is the right size is critical. To be sure
your child fits a machine, at a minimum the child should
 Be able to place both feet flat on the ground
 Be able to reach the handlebars comfortably with a slight bend at the
elbows
 Have long-enough fingers to operate the clutch and brake levers on the
handlebars
You may be tempted to buy a bigger bike for your child with the thought 
that he or she will grow into it and get more years of use out of it. However,
thinking that way is a mistake. Here’s why:
Figure 7-4:

114
Part II: Welcome to the Club 

 Buying a bike that’s too big can be dangerous. Remember, your child
knows absolutely nothing about motorcycles. It’s up to you to ensure
that your child is as safe as possible. Your youngster has enough going
through his or her mind while learning how to ride. Don’t endanger your
child by putting him or her on a machine that’s difficult to control
because it’s too big.
 A bike that’s too big may frustrate your child. Your child is excited
about learning to ride. Don’t dampen his or her enthusiasm, and maybe
even sour the entire motorcycling experience, by putting him or her on a
machine that is too big, too heavy, and too frustrating to control.
 A bigger machine costs more. Instead of spending the big bucks on a
big machine, plan on getting a right-sized machine and selling it later. Or,
better yet, use it as a hand-me-down for your next youngest child, and
the next, and the next. That way the whole family can be involved in
motorcycling.
Presenting Dirt Bike Safety Training
Your Kid Can Understand
Safety training is vital for a young, new rider, just as it is for an adult. But
training young riders can be a challenge because those riders can’t even
guess at basics like what a clutch is, what a brake is, what a throttle is, how
fast they’re going, and so on.
Your job, as a responsible parent, is to ensure that your child gets the best,
safest training possible. Before the training even begins, you need to know
the child’s bike thoroughly. You need to know the basics like how to start the
bike, where to find the kill switch (the button you push to stop the engine),
and how to adjust the throttle limiter. If you bought the bike new, read the
owner’s manual thoroughly. If you bought it used, ask the previous owner to
explain the basics to you, including whether you need to mix oil with the gas
(as is customary with some bikes).
You can’t help your child learn if you don’t know the machine yourself.
Leaving the teaching to the pros
The best way to get safety training for your child is to enroll him or her in an
organized dirt bike school for beginners. The Motorcycle Safety Foundation,
a national organization best known for its street motorcycle safety training
classes for adults, offers a dirt bike school that trains adults and children 
115
Chapter 7: What to Do if Your Kid Wants to Ride Too

as young as age 6. For more information on a class near you, go to www.
dirtbikeschool.com. Other options are also available, so ask your local
dealer if he or she knows of a local school.
Letting the pros do the teaching is a good idea for several reasons. Among
them are the following:
 The instructors know how children learn and the best way to teach them.
 Your child may feel less intimidated and feel less pressure to succeed
learning from a stranger rather than from you.
 The instructors won’t get frustrated, mad, or flustered if your child isn’t
catching on to something quickly. They’re used to it.
 The school provides the motorcycle and safety gear for the class. So 
if your child takes the class and then decides he or she doesn’t want 
to ride motorcycles after all, you aren’t out the cost of a bike and 
safety gear.
 The class is composed of a small group of kids, which may make 
learning even more fun for your child.
Kids’ classes, like adult classes, start with the very basics — the controls,
how to start the machine, and so on — and involve just pushing the bike
around a bit before learning how to ride the machine under power. Your child
learns steering, turning, dealing with obstacles like rocks, climbing hills, 
judging different terrain for traction, and a bunch of other stuff that you may
forget to cover if you do the teaching yourself.
Taking a do-it-yourself approach
If there isn’t a dirt bike school near you, and you don’t know how to ride, find
an experienced dirt-riding friend with kids to teach your child. That parent
will have experience working with dirt-riding kids, and probably will know
some of the pitfalls in training kids since he or she has provided guidance
and instruction for his or her own. If you’re an experienced rider and there’s
no dirt bike class near you, you can do the training yourself.
Following are some key points to keep in mind if you’re doing the training:
 Stay calm.
 Accept that your child may not learn as quickly as you think he or she
should.
 Take your time.
 Keep everything very simple.
116
Part II: Welcome to the Club 

You need to adjust your vocabulary to fit the child’s experience. For example,
you can’t say, “Give it some gas” or “Hit the brakes” because your child won’t
have a clue what you mean. You have to first explain that twisting the throttle
(“this thing on the right handlebar”) makes the bike go, and twisting it further
makes the bike go faster. You also need to point out the brake levers, and
then explain that to make the bike stop, the throttle has to be twisted closed
and the front brake lever has to be squeezed with the right hand while the
rear brake lever has to be pushed with the right foot. Keep everything simple
and take one step at a time. Your child has a lot to learn, so don’t rush things.
Also, offer a lot of encouragement during the training.
Always stress safety. Stay close to your child to keep him or her safe, and
keep the speed slow. Don’t let your child try anything that may be dangerous,
such as climbing a small hill, until you know he or she is ready to tackle that
challenge. Ask often how your child feels about doing or trying something —
riding a bike over a log, for instance — and if your child doesn’t feel 
comfortable with it, don’t make him or her do it.
Similarly, stress the importance of using proper safety gear. Don’t allow your
child to even sit on a motorcycle without wearing a helmet. Wearing safety
gear should be something that feels natural to your child. For more on 
purchasing this gear, check out the following section.
Considering Cool and Safe Kid’s Gear
A lot of gear is available for kids: helmets, goggles, boots, jerseys, pants,
chest protectors, neck rolls, special riding socks, knee guards, elbow guards,
wrist guards, and kidney belts.
Safety gear not only helps protect your child from injury, but it also looks
cool and is fun to wear. The makers of kids’ gear offer styles that appeal to
the younger set, like helmets with cartoonish skull graphics. Go shopping
with your youngster and you’ll find the helmet, boots, gloves, jersey, pants,
and so on that your kid not only should wear, but wants to wear.
Like adult gear, the best way to buy kids’ gear is to go to a dealer so that the
child can try stuff on to make sure it fits comfortably. You may get cheaper
prices by mail order, but you can’t be sure that what you order will fit.
If you’re worried about the cost, remember that you can sell the gear after
your child outgrows it. Safety gear is critical.
117
Chapter 7: What to Do if Your Kid Wants to Ride Too

Ensuring a proper fit
You want your little one to be safe while riding, and that means outfitting the
young rider with safety gear. But no matter how good the gear is, it won’t pro-
tect your child if it doesn’t fit right. For instance, consider these situations:
 Helmets that are too big can twist around and even come off.
 Boots that are too big can twist and injure a foot and make it difficult 
to shift and use the foot brake.
 Ill-fitting gloves can make it more difficult to manipulate the hand 
controls, and they also can cause blisters.
Do your own peace of mind, and your child, a favor, and make sure the gear
you buy your little one fits correctly. I give you pointers on how to do this in
the following sections.
Helmet
The first thing you should buy is a helmet. (I explain how a helmet protects 
a rider’s head in Chapter 5.) Expect to buy a helmet probably every year 
as your child grows. Make sure the helmet has federal Department of
Transportation (DOT), Snell Memorial Foundation, or American National
Standards Institute (ANSI) certification to show that it has been tested and
operates properly. If the child will ever wear the helmet on a streetbike, 
such as while riding as your passenger, the helmet must be DOT approved
and have a DOT sticker on it.
You don’t want to buy a child a helmet that’s too big or too small. Here’s what
you need to do to check for a proper fit:
1. Have your child put on the helmet.
First pull the helmet opening apart slightly using the chinstrap, and then
fasten the chinstrap. (Be careful not to fasten it too tightly.)
2. The helmet should fit snugly, but it shouldn’t be so tight that it’s
uncomfortable.
Ideally, the child’s eyes should be centered in the helmet’s eyeport.
3. Push the helmet forward, backward, and from side to side.
The helmet should remain snug. It shouldn’t be loose enough to be
pushed over the eyes.
4. If you have the time, have your child wear the helmet around the
store for a half hour or so to be sure it doesn’t begin to hurt.
Remember that a snug helmet will loosen a little bit as it conforms to 
the head, but it should never be so tight that it’s uncomfortable or
painful to wear.
118
Part II: Welcome to the Club 

Never buy a used helmet. A helmet is designed to be destroyed with one hard
whack, so that a rider’s head isn’t injured. A helmet can lose its ability to 
protect the rider just by being dropped on the floor, even though it may show
no signs of damage.
Boots
Boots are another critical safety item that your child needs to wear when
riding. Good, sturdy boots help protect the feet and ankles from injury due to
twisting or hard knocks against branches or rocks. They also help the rider
maintain a grip on the motorcycle’s footpegs.
Like helmets, boots must be tried on to ensure they fit, especially since one
boot maker’s child Size 6 may be a lot smaller than another maker’s child 
Size 6. Be sure that your child is wearing thick, off-road socks when trying on
boots. The boots should be snug, with no movement of the foot in the boot,
but they shouldn’t be so tight that they cut off blood circulation or are
painful to wear.
Pants and jersey
Off-road jerseys look like football jerseys and offer a little bit of padding in
the elbows for protection. They come in various materials for hot-or moder-
ate-weather riding. The jersey should be loose, especially if you plan to fit
elbow and wrist guards plus a chest protector under it.
Off-road pants should fit well and offer room for knee and shin guards. They
usually have minimal padding in the hips. Have your child try them on with
the boots, since the motocross-style pants are meant to fit inside the boots.
Outfitting your kid in safety gear 
without breaking your budget
You want the best protection possible for your child, but you’re a little short
on cash. What to do, what to do. Start with the critical safety gear, and then
add items as your budget allows. Keep in mind that if your child will just 
be riding in the backyard or trail riding, and not hitting the racetrack, he or
she doesn’t need the most expensive, most extensive list of safety items
available today.
At a minimum, your child should have a good helmet and goggles. For boots,
your child can wear sturdy, over-the-ankle, work-type boots. And any sturdy
gloves should do. Next, add a sweatshirt and bluejeans, and your child is
ready to ride for a minimal outlay of cash. The coolness factor may not be 
as high as your child would like, but you can feel good knowing that your
child’s basic safety needs are met.
119
Chapter 7: What to Do if Your Kid Wants to Ride Too

When you’re financially ready to step up a little, you can swap out some
items in your kid’s basic protection package. Your child still needs the
helmet, but now it’s time to spring for
 Some motocross-style boots that offer plenty of protection for the feet
and ankles
 An over-the-jersey chest protector to protect against rocks kicked 
up by other bikes or tree limbs hanging over trails
 Motocross gloves designed specifically for dirt riding
 Motocross-style pants that offer a better fit and more protection 
than jeans
 Knee guards that go under the pants and protect the knees and shins
from whacks
That’s all most kids need for riding. But if your child wants to get into racing,
you’ll want to add more safety gear, such as
 An under-the-jersey chest protector
 Elbow guards, wrist guards, and a neck guard
 A kidney belt
Plus, you may want to opt for top-of-the-line stuff: helmet, jersey, pants, and
boots. Hey, nobody said racing was cheap. But it is dangerous, so you really
should go with the best gear possible.
Making Trail Rides Fun
Your child will probably spend most of his or her time trail riding rather than
racing and, being the responsible parent that you are, you’ll be along for the
ride. Remember that it’s your responsibility to keep your child safe, so it’s
best for you to ride behind him or her to keep a close watch. The ride should
be fun, not a grueling day on the trail.
Even though you’re both riding, your child’s abilities and mental and physical
condition should dictate whether you take easy, moderate, or difficult trails,
how fast and how far you go, when to take a break, and when to call it a day.
120
Part II: Welcome to the Club 

Preparing for the ride
If you’ve ever taken your kids to the beach, you know that it can take some
time to round up everything and everybody to head out the door and hit 
the road. Heading off for a trail ride doesn’t have to be that way. In fact, 
you can do the following things the day before you head out to make sure
your departure from home and your experience on the trail are as pleasant 
as possible:
 The night before you go riding, let your kid practice getting geared
up. That way you can determine how long the process takes, plus your
child, with your help, can learn how to put on the knee and shin guards
and properly snap the buckles on the belt. This preparation shouldn’t 
be a problem because kids love wearing their riding gear. They’d 
probably wear it to school if you’d let them.
 Go over the motorcycles you’ll be taking on the ride and make sure
everything is working properly. Check the clutch and throttle cables,
make sure the tires have the proper air pressure, and find out if the
machines have enough oil and are gassed up.
 Have your child practice starting his or her machine, because you
know it’s going to stall during the trail ride. Also have your child 
practice laying down and picking up the machine because chances are
good that, at least at some point, the machine is going to end up on its
side in the dirt.
 Pack gear and other essentials, like gas, in your truck or trailer the
night before. Taking care of this ahead of time will ensure that you’re
ready to roll as quickly as possible in the morning.
Packing snacks, games, 
and other essentials
More than likely the ride from your house to your favorite riding area will be
long. Plan accordingly, or you may end up with a cranky kid by the time you
arrive. Take along games to play in the car or truck, and pack snacks for the
trip to the trail as well as for breaks while riding. Apples, bananas, grapes,
lots of juice, and water are good ideas.
Kids spill stuff, rip stuff, and even lose stuff. That’s just what kids do. With
this in mind, it doesn’t hurt to bring along extra gear, like goggles, a jersey,
and gloves, just in case. Plus, don’t forget a first-aid kit in case you or your
child get snagged by a tree branch, or worse.
121
Chapter 7: What to Do if Your Kid Wants to Ride Too

For the ride home, have regular clothes your child can change into to be
more comfortable. Your child may want to continue to wear his other gear,
which is okay too. Bring towels to put on the car or truck seat so the dirty
riding clothes don’t get the vehicle dirty. And consider bringing towels and
water to wash your child off and make him or her more comfortable. In fact,
you may want to take a swipe at your own dusty face with a wet towel as well.
Facing Racing: When Your 
Youngster Wants to Race
While trail riding can be a lot of fun, sometimes a child may want to compete.
Thousands of kids nationwide take part in organized competition, and
motocross racing is by far the most popular form of racing for kids. Motocross
involves racing on a natural-terrain track that features jumps, tight turns, 
and hills. A motocross race is usually divided into two motos, or races. The
riders’ finishes in both motos are tallied to give him or her an overall score. 
A moto usually lasts a specified number of laps and usually doesn’t take more
than a half-hour to complete. The racing is intense.
Other forms of organized racing also offer competitive riding opportunities
for kids on dirt bikes. They include the following:
 Hare scrambles: Hare scrambles are off-road races run on looped
courses over natural terrain. These races generally last a couple hours.
The looped course is usually a mile or more long.
 Hare and hound races: Hare and hound races are much like hare scram-
bles except that they’re usually held in the desert over a looped course
40 or 50 miles long. The rider must hit a series of checkpoints along 
the course. These races are normally held in the western United States.
 Enduros: Enduros are much like hare scrambles except that riders 
must try to stay at a designated speed throughout a race. For example,
the race organizers may decide that the riders must maintain an average
speed of 24 mph. There are various checkpoints along the course, and,
depending on how the race organizers have set up the competition,
riders who arrive at a checkpoint either too early or too late may be
penalized.
 Dirt track: Your child is unlikely to want to get into dirt-track racing but,
hey, you never know. Dirt-track racing involves racing on a dirt oval.
While adults may run on a mile-long oval dirt track, kids generally race
on half-mile or smaller tracks. Have you ever seen the Kentucky Derby
on TV? That’s the kind of track that dirt-track racers compete on.
122
Part II: Welcome to the Club 

Your local motorcycle dealership should be able to tell you about local tracks
and clubs that organize racing. Or you can contact the American Motor-
cyclist Association (AMA), which sanctions thousands of motorcycling-
related events nationwide every year. You can contact the AMA by calling
800-262-5646 or going to www.amadirectlink.com. The AMA can fill you in
on events, dates, times, and who to call to get involved in races in your area.
Determining whether your child is ready
Just because your child wants to race doesn’t mean he or she is ready to. 
As a responsible parent, it’s up to you to decide for your child. How do you
know? After all, racing can be pretty dangerous.
First, be sure your child has mastered the basic skills of riding, is a pretty
good rider, and truly has an interest in racing. Then consider the following
means of gathering information to help you decide:
 Go to some local races with your child and watch the class your child
would race in to get an idea of what the racing is like. Note whether
the racing is tight with a lot of bumping or whether the riders spread 
out pretty quickly.
 Find out whether your local track has a practice day. If so, take advan-
tage of it. This lets your child ride on the track without experiencing 
the pressure of competition, and it gives you the chance to evaluate how
well your child navigates the track, and whether he or she is, in fact,
ready to race.
 Talk to other parents to learn what their experiences have been
related to having a little racer in the family. Talk about everything,
including how far they have to travel to race, how often, and how much
racing costs.
 Determine the rules so your child races legally. Ask the organizer of a
race you’re considering where to get a copy of the rules that cover
machinery and safety requirements, class eligibility, and other things
you need to know to race legally.
 Consider your child’s temperament. Does he or she easily get flustered?
Will your little racer be horribly upset if he or she doesn’t win, or will
your child be able to accept the fact that just competing is a major
accomplishment?
123
Chapter 7: What to Do if Your Kid Wants to Ride Too

Knowing what to expect the 
first day at the track
Okay, so you’ve done your homework and decided that your child is ready to
race. You’re even ready to shell out the cash it takes to buy the best safety
equipment and bike possible, maintain the machine, and take the trips to the
tracks. In that case, you’re ready to go racing!
Here are some things to keep in mind when your child is racing at a track:
 When you get to the track, you pay a fee at the gate to get in and another
fee for every class your child enters to race. You also fill out an entry
form and sign a liability release. The friendly people at the registration
desk usually give you a sheet that tells the times for the practices and
races for the classes.
Ask if there are any printed rules for conduct at the track. For example,
some race organizers don’t allow parents on the track to help a fallen
rider unless the rider is in a class for very young racers, say, 4 to 6 
years old.
 If the race is AMA-sanctioned, and it probably is, your racer must be a
member of the AMA. You can avoid a lot of hassle by contacting and
joining the AMA before you even go to the track. But if you’re not a
member before you arrive at the track, you can sign up there.
 After you get set up in the pits, chat with other racing families, have a
good time, and keep your eye on your watch so your child doesn’t miss
practice or the race. Have plenty of water, snacks, and other necessities
to maintain the well-being of your child, just as you would on a trail ride.
(Check out the earlier section, “Making Trail Rides Fun,” for more infor-
mation on going out for trail rides.)
 Encourage your child no matter how well or how poorly he or she does,
and make sure your youngster is having fun. Too many parents let their
own competitive juices overshadow the fact that the child should be
having a good time. A parent’s screaming, anger, and frustration are not
only bad for the child, but they also ruin the fun environment for the
rest of the parents and racers.

Machine

In this part . . .
You’re ready to ride, but you don’t have a bike. What
to do? This part guides you by introducing good
beginner bikes in terms of price and performance. I also
explain the ins and outs of buying a new or used bike.
Even experienced motorcyclists sometimes don’t know
what to look for when inspecting a used bike, so I tell you
exactly what to look for. You also need insurance if you’re
going to ride, and it’s a little different from car insurance,
so I explain that in this part, too.
As a motorcyclist, you want to put a little bit of your own
personality into your motorcycle with some custom parts
or even some major custom work. I explain the best way
to go about making your machine your own. Even if you
don’t customize your bike, you definitely want to take
care of it. This way you’re sure that it provides you with
reliable service for years and that it’s in good shape when
you decide to sell. I explain how to maintain your machine
in easy-to-understand terms.

Chapter 8
First Bikes
In This Chapter
 Considering what you need in a motorcycle
 Discovering small bikes that are easy to handle
 Surveying bigger machines still suitable for a first bike
A
s an aspiring motorcyclist, you may have a vision in your mind of what
you want your bike to look like. You may see yourself on the biggest,
baddest bike on the block — one that has lots of chrome and flames in the
paint and that makes a potato-potato sound when you start it up and it idles.
Or maybe you envision riding the fastest sportbike in the city so you can 
get from stoplight to stoplight in less than three seconds.
Well, one day you can have that big cruiser with a lot of chrome or that
hyperquick sportbike. But those bikes really aren’t the best machines to 
consider when you’re just starting your motorcycling career. You must 
consider a lot of things when you’re contemplating your first motorcycle.
In this chapter, you discover what you need to consider in terms of size, 
performance, and even styling when you decide on your first bike. You also
get a look at some of the best first bikes on the market today, and you look
into some of the bigger machines as well — one of them may be the right 
first bike for you.
Determining Your Perfect First Bike
If you ask motorcyclists why they bought a particular motorcycle, they may
talk about the great handling, the powerful motor, the comfortable seating
position, or the great looks. But the bottom line is that motorcyclists buy a
bike because they like it. Some people buy cars that they’ll just live with
because they’re cheap (both the people and the cars). But motorcyclists
aren’t like that. A bike is an extension of the rider, with emotional ties. The
bike has to be cool.

Of course, first-time bike buyers need to keep their emotions in check, or
they may be riding home on the first motorcycle they sit on — and probably
paying too much for it. (I cover emotions and the nuts and bolts of buying a
motorcycle, including pricing, in Chapter 9.) The first-time motorcycle buyer
needs to be practical. For example, is a dealer who can work on the bike
located nearby? You don’t want to buy an exotic foreign machine only to find
out that the closest dealer is 200 miles away.
In this section, I clue you in on some important points and questions to 
consider when figuring out what kinds of bikes appeal most to you. I also
point out what to look for when you begin checking out bikes to actually buy.
Picking a bike is picking a lifestyle
The first consideration in buying a new bike is what style to get. After all, the
style you buy determines what motorcycling crowd you get to hang out with.
Most crowds are forgiving of new riders and accept them no matter what bike
they’re on, but others, like the Harley-Davidson crowd, generally aren’t so 
tolerant.
If you aren’t quite sure about what style or crowd fits you, start by asking
yourself what you’ll use the bike for. If you plan to mainly ride around town
and take only a few rides out in the country, a big touring bike isn’t a good
idea. (A big touring rig isn’t a good idea for a first bike anyway because it’s a
handful.) You’re likely in the market for a cruiser.
I discuss various biker lifestyles and the bikes associated with them in detail
in Chapter 4. Simply put, though, motorcycling culture breaks down into
these lifestyles:
 Touring: Touring machines are big, with a lot of cargo space for long-
distance riding. Touring riders tend to ride alone or in small groups.
 Cruiser: Cruisers are long, low machines with an upright or laid-back
seating position built for cruising. Cruiser riders usually take short
rides, with an occasional long ride thrown in. They like to wear a lot of
black and look tough.
 Sportbike: Sportbikes are racing-style machines that are favored by
younger riders who like the low weight and high performance. They look
like competition machines right off the racetrack, and some of the riders
dress like professional racers.
 Adventure-touring: Adventure-touring riders have large, street-legal, 
off-road machines with luggage so they can venture onto gravel roads
and even rougher terrain. They tend to ride alone or in small groups.
128
Part III: You and Your Machine 

 Dual-sport: A dual-sport bike is a street-legal, off-road machine that isn’t
as big as an adventurer-tourer and doesn’t have the luggage. These
riders tend to ride alone. They like their bikes for their versatility and
because they’re easy to ride, especially in traffic.
If a friend got you into motorcycling, pick a bike like he or she has so you can
ride with your friend’s crowd. That group also knows a lot about the kind of
bike you’ll be riding, so you can get advice on maintenance and tires.
You need to choose a size, power, 
and performance you can handle
Although lifestyle is one of the first things to consider, it doesn’t have to be
the main factor when you’re just starting out as a motorcyclist. The impor-
tant thing right now is to get a bike that’s easy to ride and comfortable to
learn on. After all, you won’t fit into any motorcycling group if you don’t
know how to ride a motorcycle.
If you’re a beginning motorcyclist, other motorcyclists will forgive you if you
don’t have a big, powerful, flashy machine. After all, every motorcyclist had
to start on something, and most start on something small. Besides, when you
get comfortable navigating city streets, cruising country roads, and riding the
twisty roads in the mountains, you’ll probably want to get a bigger, more
powerful motorcycle.
To start, get something small. Don’t get something so small that you look like
a clown riding one of those tiny motorcycles, but do get something that you
fit on well, that has a smaller motor, and that’s relatively lightweight.
When you’re sitting on the motorcycle, you should be able to put both feet
comfortably flat on the ground. You also should be able to easily reach the
handlebar controls. In other words, you shouldn’t be straining to reach the
handlebars and the controls on the handlebars, and you should be able to
comfortably manipulate the rear brake and shift lever with your feet.
All motorcycles perform well, whether you’re talking about the motor, suspen-
sion, or brakes. So unless you buy a 20-year-old bike, you don’t have to worry
about buying one that won’t work well for you in terms of performance. I 
recommend against buying an old bike, and I explain why in Chapter 9. Steer
clear of the big machines as well — the weight alone can be too much for 
a novice rider to handle. Finally, be sure to avoid the high-performance 
motorcycles that are scary fast.
129
Chapter 8: First Bikes

When you’re considering the power of the motor, you want something that’s
a middleweight or smaller. You don’t want a bike with a powerful motor 
that will spin the rear tire if you twist the throttle too fast and too far. What’s
a middleweight or smaller motor? That depends on the bike. For example, a
600cc cruiser is considered a small bike, whereas a 600cc sportbike is way
too much for a beginner to handle. I describe small and middleweight 
motorcycles with tame, novice-friendly motors later in this chapter.
Keep it simple, cheap, 
and easy to sell later
You’re a new rider, so you’re bound to drop the bike in your garage or in a
parking lot — maybe several times. So do you really want to be riding a big,
expensive machine for your first bike? Get a small machine that you can pick
up after you drop it; and get an inexpensive one with parts that you can
cheaply replace, so you don’t cry whenever it tips over.
Plus, it’s best to start out with a small, inexpensive machine because you may
find later that it isn’t the bike — or bike style — that you really want. For
example, you may buy a cheap sportbike for your first bike but then decide
after six months that you don’t like the crouched-down seating position; you
may want a sit-up or even a laid-back cruiser instead. A cheap machine is
easy to sell.
Styling is another consideration. Sure, you should get a motorcycle that you
like to look at. In fact, when you become a motorcyclist, you’ll find yourself in
the garage just staring at your bike for half an hour, an hour, or even longer.
Strange, but true. But for your first bike, you need to be realistic. You don’t
want a lot of extra chrome parts or plastic bodywork that can get smashed
up when you tip over.
Also, suppose that you decide after a month or two of riding that you really
don’t like motorcycling after all. Maybe motorcycling was fun to dream about,
but the reality isn’t as romantic as in your dreams. (I know, this scenario will
never happen, right?) Again, an inexpensive machine is a lot easier to sell
than an expensive one.
Purely New-Rider Machines
With some motorcycles, an experienced motorcyclist can look at them and
immediately know that the owner is either a new rider or a small person. But
that’s okay. Everyone has to learn somehow, and the smallest bikes are the
easiest to learn on.
130
Part III: You and Your Machine 

You can peruse a good mix of small machines, from cruisers and sportbikes
to standards. They’re light, inexpensive, and easy to ride. Long term, women
generally buy these bikes (most guys are simply too big for them), but
they’re great for anyone to learn on. Here I show some of the popular small
bikes on the market.
Cruisers
The Harley-Davidson Sportster 883 (see Figure 8-1) is the brand’s smallest
machine. However, this one isn’t as small as the small bikes other manufac-
turers offer. The Sportster 883 is relatively cheap and, as such, allows for 
relatively inexpensive entry into the world of Harley-Davidson motorcycling.
Here are the specs for the machine:
Engine: 53.9-cubic-inch (883cc) air-cooled V-twin
Seat height: Laden 27.3 inches; unladen 29.3 inches (laden means with a
180-pound rider sitting on it)
Wheelbase: 60 inches
Claimed dry weight: 563 pounds
Suggested retail: $6,695

The Star V Star 250 (shown in Figure 8-2) offers a lot of fun in a small, cruiser-
style package. This pint-size cruiser is light, low, inexpensive, and looks great.
Check out the specs on the bike:

Sportbikes
It’s hard to find a small sportbike. Fortunately, if you’ve decided you want a
small, nimble machine that looks great and will let you perfect your quick
cornering and other sportbike-related skills, Kawasaki has exactly what you
need: the Ninja 250R (see Figure 8-3).
Engine: 249cc liquid-cooled parallel twin
Seat height: 30.7 inches
Wheelbase: 54.7 inches
Claimed dry weight: 333 pounds

Naked, or standard, machines
A naked bike, also known as a standard, is another great first bike that’s easy
to ride and looks great. The 2008 Honda Nighthawk (see Figure 8-4) is a per-
fect example of a small naked bike. Here are the specs for the Nighthawk:
Engine: 234cc air-cooled V-twin
Seat height: 29.3 inches
Wheelbase: 56.3 inches
Claimed curb weight (ready to ride and full of fluids, including gas): 
315 pounds
Suggested retail: $3,699
For something bigger, with double the motor size, the 2008 Buell Blast is
worth a look (see Figure 8-5). This great entry-level machine features a rela-
tively light weight, great power, and two seat-height options. So if you’re
height-challenged you can go with the seat that will bring you 2 inches closer
to Mother Earth (25.5 inches compared to the standard seat’s 27.5 inches).
The specs of this bike include the following:
Engine: 30-cubic-inch (492cc) air-cooled single
Seat height: 25.7 inches (or low profile 25.5 inches)
Wheelbase: 55 inches
Dry weight: 360 pounds
Suggested retail: $4,695

Bikes That Don’t Scream “Rookie!”
You’ll find an awful lot of motorcycles to choose from when looking for your
first streetbike. Some machines are great for new riders but still work for

experienced motorcyclists as well. After all, the manufacturers wouldn’t keep
making them if people weren’t buying them. And there can’t be that many
new motorcyclists coming into the fold each year.
These bikes have tame motors, lighter weight, and a relatively cheap price,
which make them fairly easy to acquire, ride, and maintain. And, who knows?
Maybe you’ll find that you really like your first bike a lot, and you’ll keep it for
five years or more.
These bikes are cruisers, sportbikes, and standards, so you do have to make
a lifestyle choice when you decide which type of bike feels the most comfort-
able. One caveat is that women can choose smaller machines without facing
the ribbing from fellow motorcyclists that men may get.
Cruisers you can’t go wrong with
If you want to get into the cruiser lifestyle, you have a lot of choices. You can
get a cruiser with a smaller motor that looks just as big and bad as its older
siblings. You’ll look cool cruising and can spend less money for that machine
than you would getting a more powerful bike. The downside, though, is that
even the middleweight cruisers can be heavy. Make sure it’s light enough and
balanced well enough that you can push it around a little bit in a parking lot.
An 800cc or 900cc machine may be as big as you want to go for a first bike.
Cruisers can go up to 2,000cc. Depending on your size, you may want to 
start with a 600cc bike. These machines give you enough oomph in the motor
department yet are relatively easy to handle. Honda, Star, Suzuki, and
Kawasaki all make great bikes in this size.
When you’re looking at and sitting on bikes, be sure to compare the specifica-
tions. For example, some bikes have seats that are 2 inches higher than
others, which can make the difference between comfortably planting both feet
on the ground and having to go around on tippy-toes. Plus, a liquid-cooled
motor stays cooler than an air-cooled motor, especially if you plan to do a lot
of stop-and-go city riding.
Because you do have a lot of choices in cruisers, you need to shop around.
Find a look you like, a size that fits, and a cost you can afford. (I discuss
buying a bike more in Chapter 9.) Also consider whether accessories are
readily available so you can customize your machine to your liking. That’s
part of the fun of motorcycling — making your machine your own. (Check 
out Chapter 12 for more on customizing.)
The 2008 Honda Shadow Spirit 750, shown in Figure 8-6, has a long and low
look. It features shortened fenders and a low seat height. Check out the specs
for this machine:

The 2008 Star V Star Classic (shown in Figure 8-7) has a retro look because it
appears that it has no rear shock, but it does. It also has floorboards, steel
fenders, and a lot of chrome. Here are the specs:
Engine: 40-cubic-inch (649cc) air-cooled V-twin
Seat height: 27.9 inches
Wheelbase: 64 inches
Claimed dry weight: 505 pounds
Suggested retail: $6,199
The 2008 Suzuki Boulevard C50T (see Figure 8-8) is a cruiser with some tour-
ing-bike touches, including a big windscreen and saddlebags. Check out the
specs for this machine:
Engine: 50-cubic-inch (819.35cc) liquid-cooled V-twin

Friendly standards
Standard machines, or naked bikes, also make good beginner machines if 
you pick wisely. Like sportbikes, some are novice-friendly machines and
some are bigger, more powerful bikes that can be a handful for a new rider.
A standard machine offers a more upright position than a sportbike and
includes less plastic bodywork to crack if you drop the machine. Its 
performance is about on par with that of some sportbikes.
The 2008 Suzuki SV650 (see Figure 8-10) is a good, all-around standard
machine with no bodywork. A lot of experienced riders like this bike, but it’s
also good for beginners — as long as they’re careful until they get used to the
power. Check out the specs for the SV650:
Engine: 645cc liquid-cooled V-twin
Seat height: 31.5 inches
Wheelbase: 56.7 inches

Tame sportbikes
If you don’t see yourself as a cruiser rider and instead picture yourself as a
sportbike rider strafing the apexes of corners on mountain roads, consider 
a mid-level motorcycle.
But be particularly careful if you decide to go with a sportbike (unless it’s
one of the small ones, which I discuss earlier in this chapter). A mid-level
high-performance machine like the Honda CBR600RR is designed for 
experienced riders only.
Certain midperformance sportbikes work great for beginners: The Kawasaki
Ninja 500R and the Suzuki GS500F combine sleek styling, plenty of power for
the novice, and low weight to make a great package for the new rider.

Double-duty dual-sports
A great way for a new rider to learn how to ride is to get a small dual-purpose
bike (also called dual-sport) that can be ridden both on the road and in the
dirt. Although I wouldn’t recommend taking them on the freeway because
they don’t have the oomph to get out of the way of an 18-wheeler barreling
down on you. These bikes are small, light, and easy to ride. They have a rela-
tively high seating position so you can see in traffic clearly, and they can be
taken off-road for some dirt experience, which increases your street skills.
A 250cc or 200cc machine is the best choice. If you decide to go this route,
make sure the bike is a street-legal dual-sport machine. It must have lights,
turn signals, mirrors, street-legal tires, and whatever else is necessary for 
you to legally ride it on the street.
Some dirt bikes look like street-legal dual-sports but aren’t. For example, they
may have taillights and headlights that aren’t approved for street use. You
can’t legally license these bikes for street use. These bikes are called enduros.
I discuss enduro machines in Chapter 4.

Buying a Bike: What 
You Must Know
In This Chapter
 Getting a deal on a new bike
 Avoiding a lemon when buying a used machine
 Finding a deal and avoiding Internet scams
You’ve got some cash in your pocket and a spring in your step as you
walk into your local motorcycle dealership. You’re ready to plunk down
cash for a new motorcycle. You’ve done your dreaming and your homework,
and you know exactly what you want and how much you want to pay for it.
You’re ready to do the deal.
Getting to this point, though, may have taken weeks or even months of
research. At one time, you wanted a motorcycle so bad you could taste it. It
would have been easy — too easy — to walk into a dealership, look around 
at the bikes, sit on a few, and then say, “I’ll take that one.” And that would be
fine, since, as a motorcycle owner, you’ve now joined the motorcycling frater-
nity. The downside, though, is that maybe emotion would have gotten the
best of you, and you would have bought the flashiest bike instead of the one
that best fits your needs. Or maybe you would have paid too much. Or maybe
the dealership wasn’t the best place for you to buy a bike. After all, buying a
motorcycle from a dealership should be the beginning of a relationship with
that dealership, not the end.
Whether you’re buying new or used, the most important research you can do
is to first decide what style of motorcycle you want — a touring, a cruiser, or
a sportbike — and then decide on a handful of bikes that fit your needs. From
there, you need to determine the selling prices of those machines. You also
need to decide which of the various dealerships in your area that sells those
bikes is best for you. With that research done, you’re ready to buy.

In this chapter, you explore the ins and outs of buying a motorcycle, both old
and new. You discover how to find a good dealership, how to get a good deal
on a new bike, and how to pay for it. Buying new is easy. Buying used, on the
other hand, can be tough. Here you discover how to avoid buying a used
machine that will require much more work than it’s worth, how to negotiate a
fair price, and how to avoid getting ripped off. Plus, you get insider tips to
make your newly acquired used bike operate like new. (Note: If you’re unsure
of what type of bike suits you best, head to Chapter 8 first.)
Buying New: Getting on 
a Bike the Easy Way
There’s nothing like the euphoria you feel walking into a dealership that 
sells various brands of motorcycles, knowing that you’re going to walk out 
as the new owner of one of the bikes. While it may be one of the happiest
days of your life, that euphoria can work against you in buying a new 
motorcycle. Why? Because that euphoria may cause you to pay too much 
for a motorcycle just because you want it so badly.
If you want to get a deal on a bike, keep your emotions in check and your
checkbook in your pocket. Be willing to walk away from a deal if you can’t
negotiate the price down to a level close to what you want to pay. Also, be
firm but polite in your negotiations. After all, you don’t want to leave a sour
taste in the mouth of the dealership where you’ll be returning to buy parts
and have service work done.
Ideally, you’ll find a dealership that you enjoy going to and that has knowl-
edgeable staff in the sales, service, and parts departments. This should be
the beginning of a long and happy relationship for both parties. This section
provides tips on finding such a dealer and getting a great bike from it.
Choosing the right dealer
Even motorcyclists with garages full of bikes like to visit motorcycle dealer-
ships to look at the latest machines. They have no intention of buying. 
They just want to look. A prospective motorcycle buyer also should visit
dealerships in the area and look around.
It’s important to find a good dealership for several reasons. You want to 
support a dealership that supports the sport, you want your work done 
correctly in the service department, you want the right parts when you order
146
Part III: You and Your Machine 

them, and you want as little hassle as possible if you need warranty work
done. The following sections provide tips on what to watch for when visiting
dealerships.
In addition to doing your own research, ask your riding buddies or other
riders about various dealerships. Motorcyclists love to talk about anything
related to motorcycling and love to give their opinions. You may hear some
horror stories about botched jobs at a dealership’s service department, but
you also may hear praise related to great work and fair prices.
Are the managers and salespeople knowledgeable?
Don’t be afraid to chat with the salespeople and managers about motorcycles
and motorcycling. Unless they’re really busy, at a good dealership, the 
salespeople and mangers will be happy to talk with you — not only because
they’re enthusiastic motorcyclists, but also because you may become a 
customer later.
The manager almost undoubtedly is an enthusiast. However, you may run 
into some salespeople who don’t seem to know much about motorcycling and
motorcycles — even the brands carried at that dealership. That lack of exper-
tise is something to make a mental note of, but it shouldn’t raise any red flags
by itself. Those salespeople could be new to the dealership. And they may not
be motorcycle enthusiasts at all, but they sell motorcycles for a job.
When you’re ready to buy a motorcycle, if you buy it from that dealership,
you’ll need to know more about the bike than the salesperson does; the sales-
person probably won’t be able to answer your detailed questions about the
machine. You’ll likely find at least one knowledgeable salesperson on the
staff, though.
Is the dealership involved in the motorcycling community?
While you’re looking around and chatting up the managers and sales staff,
find out how involved the dealership is in community motorcycling. Does the
dealership sponsor any local racers? Is it involved in any charity rides? Does
it serve as a destination of rides? If the dealership does this stuff, it shows
that it’s part of the motorcycling community and isn’t just out to make a buck
off motorcyclists. While this stuff isn’t critical, it’s always best to support
those who support the sport.
Is the parts department well stocked?
After you buy a motorcycle, you’ll need parts. Check out a dealership’s 
parts department before you buy a bike. Observe and listen. Determine
whether the parts people are knowledgeable. See whether they allow cus-
tomers to step behind the counter to look at the parts microfiche to be sure
they’re getting the right part. Nothing is more frustrating than ordering a 
part through the parts department — even something simple, like an oil 
147
Chapter 9: Buying a Bike: What You Must Know

filter — waiting two weeks for the part to arrive, and then discovering it’s not
the right part. Be friendly with the parts staff and especially get to know the
parts manager. Then they’re more likely to go that extra mile to find and
order the part you need.
Is the service department well staffed?
If you can get a peek at the dealership’s service area, see if there’s room
around the work areas so that bikes can be pushed around without bumping
into things. Note the ages of the mechanics: If they’re all very young, maybe
the shop has a high turnover rate and it values increasing profits over keep-
ing experienced mechanics. See if education certificates are displayed show-
ing that the mechanics receive training to keep up with the latest motorcycle
technology. You’ll most likely find a good mix in ages among the mechanics
or the dealership probably won’t be in business long.
Cutting a good deal
Some people are born hard-nosed negotiators, while others would rather
have root-canal surgery than to have to face off with a professional salesper-
son. But as long as you’re willing to walk out of a dealership without a bike 
if your price isn’t met, negotiating is pretty easy.
Okay, one caveat is that you have to be realistic about the price you’re willing
to pay for a machine. You can’t be Mr. Cheapskate and offer half of what a
dealer paid for a motorcycle and expect to get it. Plus, some dealerships are
very firm about cutting deals — they won’t do it. They figure if you won’t buy
the bike then someone else will at the price that the dealership wants. After
all, they don’t have the volume that car dealerships have so they can’t make
the deals that car dealers do and stay in business. Keep in mind that that
dealers have other charges related to the bike that are negotiable, such as
dealer prep, and some that aren’t, like taxes.
But if you’re realistic about the amount you’re willing to pay, with the 
idea in mind that the dealership can sell a bike for 15 percent below the
Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (or even more) and still make a profit,
you may go home with your dream machine at a reasonable cost. And with 
a little research, you may find that the bike you want isn’t selling well, in
which case you can probably negotiate an even better deal.
Researching price
To get a good deal on a new motorcycle, you need to do research on pricing
before you walk into a dealership to buy a bike. After you decide on the 
handful of bikes that you’re interested in, go to the manufacturers’ Web sites
to find out the Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price, or MSRP. If you don’t
have access to the Internet, ask at the dealership. This gives you a base to
start from.
148
Part III: You and Your Machine 

If the bike you want is very popular, expect to pay MSRP or more. The dealer
knows that if you won’t buy the bike, someone else will. On the other hand, 
if the bike you want isn’t very popular, you should be able to get it below
MSRP because the dealer wants to get it out of the building. For this reason,
having a handful of bikes in mind is a good idea — some may be cheaper 
than others.
You can research the selling prices of new motorcycles in various ways. You
can read bike reviews in motorcycle magazines. Sometimes you’ll read that a
certain bike is difficult to get and that you can expect to pay over MSRP. Or
you may see that a certain bike isn’t selling, meaning that you can expect to
pay less than MSRP. Also, ask motorcycling friends. They may have a feel for
the prices. You can also check the Web sites of dealerships in your state to
see what the bikes are selling for. Plus, you can visit local dealerships and 
see what the prices are on the sales tags.
While you’re at the dealership, see if there’s a one- or two-year-old model of
the bike you want on the sales floor. These bikes are still new and likely will
be cheaper than the current model.
Considering other potential costs
When you determine whether you’ll likely pay MSRP, below MSRP, or above
MSRP, you need to consider the other costs that the dealer will tack on
before the motorcycle can roll out the door:
 Dealer prep: This is dealer preparation, also called setup, which
involves assembly of the motorcycle. The bike arrives at the dealership
unassembled in a crate. The dealership must assemble it and put in the
required fluids, such as oil. This fee can be $400 or more.
 Destination charge: This charge is also known as the freight charge. Here
you pay for getting the bike from the factory to the dealership. This fee
also can be $400 or more.
 Tax, title, and registration: The government gets this money, but you
have to pay it to title and register your motorcycle.
Using your information to negotiate a better price
The full price of a new bike could be MSRP or more plus the following: dealer
prep; tax, title, and registration; and the destination fee. This price is the
price out the door.
Your goal when walking into a dealership to buy a motorcycle is to walk out
the door with your motorcycle at the lowest out-the-door price possible. 
You need to negotiate. Negotiate the bike price, the dealer prep fee, and the
destination charge. Unfortunately, you can’t negotiate the tax, title, and regis-
tration. But, if you’re a good negotiator, you can negotiate a good price on a
bike and have the dealer waive the dealer prep charge and destination fee.
149
Chapter 9: Buying a Bike: What You Must Know

You can even try to get the dealer to throw in some accessories to sweeten
the deal, like saddlebags and a new helmet. If you can’t negotiate a deal 
that you’re happy with, consider walking away and trying your negotiating
skills at a different dealership. In fact, after you stand up to head out the
door, you may find that the salesperson or manager that you’re dealing with
is suddenly more likely to come down in price on the bike.
You’ve probably bought a few cars in your lifetime, so just remember that
negotiating to buy a bike works the same way. Although negotiations are 
usually quicker in a motorcycle dealership, and there’s also a lot less pres-
sure to buy. You ask how much they’re asking for the bike, you counter with
an offer, and they normally say that’s too low. Or they may try to steer you 
to a different machine.
Following are a few additional tips to use to your advantage while 
negotiating:
 It’s best to go to the dealership at the end of the month or at the end of
the year when salespeople and sales managers have to meet quotas. At
this time, they’re often more willing to deal.
 A new bike should be pristine. That means that every nick or scratch
should reduce the price of the bike.
The bottom line is this: You need to be willing to walk out of the dealership 
at any time without a new bike. That’s what gives you the advantage over the
dealership. Realize, however, that it’s unlikely you’ll get a megadeal. After all,
motorcycle dealerships simply don’t have the volume to make those kinds 
of deals, and they can only get limited numbers of the most popular models
from the factories.
Financing: But I want that bike now!
If you don’t have the cash to pay the out-the-door price for a motorcycle, 
you have to get a loan. You can get a loan at the dealership, through a bank
or finance company, or through a credit union — provided that your credit
worthiness is good, of course.
To get a loan, you need a substantial down payment — usually 20 percent or
more of the purchase price. Plus, the company that loans you the money
probably will require that you have full-coverage insurance on the motorcy-
cle, meaning that if the bike gets damaged, the insurance company will pay to
have it repaired. (I discuss motorcycle insurance in Chapter 10.)
Getting financing at the dealership is the easiest way to go. You’re already
there, and you can get a decision on your loan in minutes. And if the financ-
ing is through one of the motorcycle manufacturers, you may be able to take
advantage of a special financing deal, such as 0 percent interest the first two
150
Part III: You and Your Machine 

years of the loan. So if you can pay off the loan within the first two years, it
amounts to an interest-free loan. Generally, though, financing at the dealer-
ship incurs a higher interest rate than a loan from a bank or credit union.
If you don’t want to get financing at the dealership, you can go to a bank,
finance company, or credit union. The credit union probably will offer the
lowest interest rate, followed by the bank. The finance company likely will
have the highest interest rate, so use it only as a last option. Okay, your last
option is to max out your credit cards to buy a bike, but that’s not a good
idea because of the high interest rate. Besides, you know how difficult it is 
to pay off credit cards. But if you really want a bike. . . .
At any of these lending institutions, you’ll probably have to get a personal
loan. You’re being lent the money based on your own worthiness to repay 
the loan rather than on the bike as collateral. Many lending institutions don’t
accept a motorcycle for collateral.
If you try everywhere and can’t get a loan, save some money and buy a used
bike, and rebuild your credit so that in a couple years or so, you can buy a
brand-spanking-new machine.
Ensuring a safe and successful 
first ride home
Before you leave the dealership with your new motorcycle, you should have
completed a motorcycle safety training course and you need to have insur-
ance and a motorcycle license in hand. Too many horror stories tell of people
hopping on their new motorcycle at the dealership and then crashing before
they get home.
Familiarize yourself with your bike
Before leaving the dealership, have a salesperson show you how to start the
bike and operate all the controls. With some motorcycles, you must hold in
the clutch lever to start the bike; with others, you don’t. On some motorcy-
cles, the turn signals are operated by a single switch on the left handlebar; on
others, a switch on the left handlebar controls the left turn signal, and a
switch on the right controls the right turn signal. So, before you drive off the
lot, know your controls. Also check the fluids on your bike before you ride
off. It’s rare, but sometimes when the bike is assembled, the assembler for-
gets to put engine oil in the machine.
If you’re uncomfortable riding your bike home, have an experienced friend
ride it home for you. Or you can opt to take it home in a truck or trailer. Who
knows? Maybe the dealership will even deliver it for you if you don’t live too
far away.
151
Chapter 9: Buying a Bike: What You Must Know

Obtain the proper manuals
Besides having the owner’s manual that came with the bike, you should 
consider buying the factory service manual, the factory parts manual, and 
a general repair and service manual made for your bike.
The factory service manual is very detailed and is written for mechanics, so
you may find some parts of it difficult to understand. In those cases, the 
less-detailed general repair and service manual should be good enough to
walk you through the procedure. The factory parts manual is invaluable not
only because of its exploded views of how various parts go together (which
is extremely useful when those parts are lying around on your garage floor)
but also because you can use it as a reference to order parts later from the
dealership: You can use the factory part number, ensuring that you get the
right part.
Also get a couple spare keys made for your new machine. No matter what
you think, you’ll eventually lose your keys.
Knowing what to do when 
you get your bike home
When you get the bike home, read the owner’s manual that came with it. 
This basic manual explains the locations and functions of various controls,
tells what fluids to use (such as the type of engine oil), and runs you 
through the break-in procedure.
The break-in procedure ensures that all the moving metal parts seat and 
mate properly. Be sure to follow the manufacturer’s break-in procedure,
which involves such things as not exceeding certain engine rpm limits within
a certain number of miles of operating the motorcycle, and changing the
engine oil after about 600 miles.
Also consider washing and waxing your bike and lubricating the cables and
chains soon after you get it home. Not only does this make your bike shine,
but it also gives you the opportunity to check all the bolts to make sure they
are tight, and to check the routing of the cables for kinks.
Car people like to put a spray-on rubber or vinyl protectant on their tires to
make them shine. Don’t put it on motorcycle tires. That stuff is super slippery
and takes a long time to wear off. If you get any of that stuff on the part of
your tire that contacts the road, you’ll crash the first time you take a turn.
152
Part III: You and Your Machine 

Buying Used, Not Abused
We all want a new motorcycle, but we all can’t afford it. Of course, the minute
a motorcycle is ridden out of a dealership parking lot, it becomes a used
motorcycle and drops in value significantly, despite what the owner may
think. Very few bikes hold their value. That’s great news for those of us who
want to get into motorcycling but don’t want to spend lots of money to do it.
The bad news is that too many used motorcycles have been, at best, not
maintained properly and, at worst, abused. A potential buyer has to know
what he or she is looking at, and looking for, when inspecting a machine for
possible purchase. That’s because when the deal is done and the money is
exchanged, the bike is yours.
That said, though, you can find some deals in the used bike market, especially
if you’re willing to invest some time, money, and elbow grease in making your
new machine look, and ride, almost like new. Keep in mind that most riders
overprice their bikes when it’s time to sell, so unless you really want the bike,
don’t pay the inflated price. Also, you’ll probably have to put a bunch of
money into a used bike after you buy it.
But you can get a nice used motorcycle for around $1,500, and a great used
motorcycle for $5,000 (compared to $8,000 or more for a new machine).
Motorcycling is within reach for anyone with enthusiasm and the ability to
sock away a few bucks every couple of weeks for a while.
You can buy a used bike from a dealer, from a private party, or at a bank
repossession auction. You pay more at a dealership, but at least you know
that the bike has been inspected by professional mechanics, and you may 
be able to get the dealer to throw a helmet into the deal. When buying from 
a private party, you need to know what to look for that indicates signs of
trouble, and you need to know the right questions to ask.
Old bikes can be trouble
It’s tempting to buy an old bike, like a 20- or 30-year-old machine, because it’s
so cheap. Also, new riders probably figure they will drop the bike a lot while
learning to ride, so they don’t want to learn on something expensive.
New riders shouldn’t get an old bike, for several reasons:
 They’re unreliable. One loose wire or bad connection can strand you in
the middle of nowhere, and it will be difficult to trace the problem.
 Most dealers won’t work on bikes more than ten years old. You would
have to be a pretty good mechanic yourself to keep the bike running.
153
Chapter 9: Buying a Bike: What You Must Know

 Parts are difficult to get, especially if the bike requires odd-sized tires.
 When it’s time to get rid of the bike, you probably won’t be able to sell it
because it’s so old.
Stay away from an old bike unless it’s supercheap, like 100 bucks, and you
plan to ride it only in your yard to learn how to ride.
Asking the right questions
Before you go hunting for a used bike, it’s a good idea to know what bike or
bikes you want to buy. Do research and have two or three in mind so you
aren’t locked into just trying to hunt down one particular bike, which may or
may not be hard to find. Get all the information you can from friends and off
Web sites so you know as much about the bikes as possible. When you find
an ad for a bike you might want to buy, make an appointment with the owner
to see it.
After you’re there, start gathering information:
 Ask to see the title, and then compare the vehicle identification
number on the title with the number on the bike. These numbers
absolutely must match. If they don’t, then don’t buy the bike — you may
not be able to get it titled and registered. Also, the bike may be stolen. 
In some states, the vehicle identification number, or VIN, matches the
VIN number on the frame. In other states, the VIN number on the title
goes with the VIN number on the motor. Check with your local Bureau of
Motor Vehicles title office before you go to look at any bikes, to see how
your state handles the VIN on the title.
 Chit-chat with the owner to try to determine whether he or she is a
motorcycle enthusiast or just had the bike for cheap transportation.
Chances are, an enthusiast will have taken better care of the bike than a
casual rider. Ask if the owner has any maintenance records. If not, find
out how often the oil was changed, the chain lubricated, the brake fluid
changed, and any other maintenance done. Ask if the fork oil has ever
been changed. It’s pretty rare for a motorcyclist to change the fork oil, so
if you find an owner who has, in fact, changed it every four years or so,
you’ve probably found an owner who has kept the bike in tip-top shape.
 Examine the bodywork. Is it original? Is it free of scrape marks or
cracks? If any body panels have been replaced or there are scrape marks
on the bodywork, the bike has been in a crash. Ask about it. A hard
crash could mean a bent frame.
 Make sure all the electrical components are working, including the
headlight, taillight, and turn signals. Make sure the controls and
switches operate smoothly. Ask when the cables were lubricated last.
Make sure the throttle operates smoothly.
154
Part III: You and Your Machine 

 Ask if the bike has a paper, wire mesh, or foam air filter, and ask
when it was last cleaned or replaced. If it isn’t difficult to get to, ask to
see it. A very dirty air filter isn’t a good sign: Dirt may have passed into
the motor, which isn’t good.
 Find out how old the chain and sprockets are. Look at the chain to see
whether it’s clean and lubricated. Check the sprockets to see if they
have hooked or bent teeth, which means the sprockets and chain need
to be replaced.
 Look for any fluid leaks, such as from the cylinder head or the fork
tubes. If there are leaks, the head gasket or fork seals need to be
replaced. Open the gas tank cap and peer inside with a flashlight to look
for rust.
 If possible, put the bike up on a centerstand and pull and push the
fork tubes back and forth to feel for play in the steering head. If
there’s play, the steering head bearings need to be replaced. Do the
same with the front and rear wheels, but move them from side to side to
check for worn-bearing play.
 Look closely at the frame, even underneath, to see if you find any
cracks. Pay particular attention to the areas around welds. Also try to
determine whether all the frame railings are straight.
 Ask for a test ride. A lot of owners won’t do this because so many bikes
are stolen that way and because of liability concerns (you may get hurt
or even killed). But if you give the owner a deposit to hold while you 
go for the ride, you may be able to do it. Or you can try to cut a deal
with the owner that you will buy the bike with the option of selling it
back to the owner for the same price within an hour if you don’t like it. 
If you can’t ride it, have the owner start up the bike so you can hear it
run. You shouldn’t see smoke coming out of the exhaust pipe unless 
it’s a two-stroke machine.
What to look for during a test ride
If the owner lets you take the bike for a test ride, that’s great. Take it easy
during the ride because it is a new machine to you and you don’t know how 
it handles. For example, if you’re used to riding cruisers with heavy steering,
you may find that this particular bike steers quickly; if you ride it like you
would a bike with a slow-moving front end, you could find yourself in big
trouble.
While riding the bike, try to get a sense of whether the handlebars are bent
and the frame is straight. Feel how the suspension works. If it’s very soft, it
could mean you’d need to put money into suspension work. Make sure the
bike shifts smoothly. If it’s tough to get into second or third gear, for example,
that may be a problem. Run it up and down all the gears to make sure they 
all work. You don’t have to go fast to do this.
155
Chapter 9: Buying a Bike: What You Must Know

Listen for any unusual noises from the engine. If you aren’t familiar with that
particular model, you may need to ask the owner about any usual noises 
you hear — and hope you get a straight answer.
Make sure the bike feels planted and solid. If it shakes when you turn, the
wheel bearings could be shot.
Figuring out and negotiating a fair price
By doing your homework ahead of time — researching bikes on the Internet
and talking to friends — you should have a pretty good idea of a fair price 
for the bike you’re looking for. You can glance at prices in classified ads for
those bikes, but those prices are generally high. They’re asking prices, not
selling prices.
After you’ve inspected the bike you’re looking at, you should have a pretty
good idea of whether it’s worth the asking price — or even the price you
researched for a clean, used model of that bike. If it has flaws, such as broken
bodywork or worn-out tires, figure that into your negotiations and use those
points to try to get the seller to lower the asking price.
Worn-out tires alone will cost you $200 to $300 to replace after you get the
bike home. So if the tires need to be replaced, make that a major negotiating
point. If the bodywork is damaged, you have another major negotiating 
point; bodywork is very expensive.
If you negotiate and still feel that the seller wants too much money, walk
away from the deal. You’ll have other opportunities. Being willing to walk
away from the motorcycle gives you the upper hand in negotiations. There
will be other machines that you’ll want to buy.
Getting the bike home
If you’ve decided to buy the bike and you want to ride the bike home, you
must have completed motorcycle safety training and you must have a license
and insurance. (I discuss motorcycle insurance in Chapter 10.) Otherwise,
load the bike into a truck or trailer to get it home. Or consider having a friend
ride it home for you.
When you get the bike home, it’s a good idea to get the factory service manual
and the factory parts manual, if they’re still available for your machine. Also
pick up a general repair and service manual made for your bike. The parts
manual is particularly useful because it gives exploded views of how various
parts fit together. And it’s a great reference for ordering parts from a 
dealership because you can order by the factory part numbers.
156
Part III: You and Your Machine 

Also get a couple spare keys made. Then wash and wax the bike to make it
look as good as possible, and check for any missing or loose bolts. Check 
the routing of any cables for kinks. Finally, be sure you lubricate all the cables
and the chain.
Buying Off the Internet: 
Deal or No Deal?
The Internet has really been a boon in this information age. You want infor-
mation about a particular motorcycle? You can probably find it on the
Internet. You want to find out how to change the oil or air filter on your bike?
Yep, you can probably find that out also. Need parts? You can find them
there. In fact, on the Internet you can buy an entire motorcycle from a dealer,
a private party, or, unwittingly, a junkyard.
Although you can find a lot of information on the Internet, not all of it is 
correct. Approach advice cautiously, judging the source. Remember, it’s easy
to, let’s say, embellish when discussing a motorcycle for sale on the Internet.
Even so, the Internet allows you to see what motorcycles are for sale not just
in your area, but throughout your state and even throughout the country.
If you’re thinking about buying a bike off the Internet, consider only machines
that you can actually drive to and look at before you hand over cash. Some of
the bikes listed on the Internet don’t really exist; they’re just phantoms to get
money from people. Also, if you see the bike that was described as being in
“pristine condition,” you may find that it isn’t in such great shape and isn’t
worth the asking price. Then you can negotiate the price or walk away.
Buying new: A great way to shop around
The Internet gives you the opportunity to easily and quickly compare 
prices of new bikes at dealerships around your state. You can shop around
by going to the Web sites of the various dealerships or by going to one of 
the motorcycle-selling Web sites. Probably the biggest is Cycle Trader
www.cycletrader.com.
Not all dealers sell their bikes at MSRP. In fact, if they want to move some
models off the showroom floor, dealers cut the price drastically. You may find
it worthwhile to drive across the state, or even to another state, to pick up a
bike if you can save $1,000 or more on the purchase price. The dealer may
even ship the bike to you.
157
Chapter 9: Buying a Bike: What You Must Know

Just as when buying a bike any other way, do your homework, know the 
bike well, and be familiar with the going prices. You can try to negotiate with
dealers over the Internet, but it’s usually not a good idea to try to leverage a
dealer by saying you can get the bike cheaper elsewhere. A common response
is, “Well, go buy it there, then.” Also remember that when you’re buying a bike
you’re starting a relationship with that dealer, so be firm but polite.
Buying used: The deals are out there
Just as in the regular world, the cyber world has a lot of used motorcycles 
for sale — and a lot of overpriced used motorcycles. You can look for deals at
online auction places like eBay or in online classifieds like Cycle Trader or
craigslist.
With online auctions, people tend to get carried away with their bidding, or
they don’t really know what they’re buying and they end up paying too much.
Don’t fall into that trap. Set an upper limit that you’ll bid for a bike, and stick
to it. If you don’t get the bike, you’ll have other opportunities. Treat an online
classified ad like you would an ad in the paper.
In both cases, ask the seller a lot of questions. If the bike is within driving dis-
tance, go look at it. Watch for auctions that end on Wednesday; that seems to
be the day when the fewest people bid on things, so selling prices are
cheaper. And don’t forget to check dealer Web sites to see what trade-ins
they may be offering.
Handling the purchase
If you’re buying online from a dealer, the dealership will want all its money up
front. If you’re buying from a private party, the seller usually will want a down
payment, or earnest money, within a certain number of days and then the 
balance when you pick up the bike. If possible, try to arrange matters so that
the seller sends you the title when you send the down payment, or try to
hand over all the cash at the time you pick up the bike.
The seller will probably want cash because it’s too easy to make phony
money orders and bank drafts nowadays. The seller may also want to be paid
through PayPal, which isn’t a bad idea because it offers you some protection.
If you bought a bike from someone who lives far away and you can’t go get it,
you have no choice but to send the entire amount and hope that the seller is
honest and will, in fact, ship the bike to you. This is obviously very risky, and
I don’t recommend it.
158
Part III: You and Your Machine 

Internet scams to watch for
The Internet is full of scammers; after all, you aren’t dealing face to face 
with people or businesses. So be careful that you don’t fall for a scam. If you
see a bike for a great price, it’s probably a scam. As the old saying goes, if it’s
too good to be true, it probably is. Sure, when you see a 2-year-old Harley-
Davidson for $7,000, you may start drooling, but be realistic. That bike does-
n’t exist. People have lost thousands of dollars buying bikes on the Internet
because they’ve sent money to scammers who are primarily in Nigeria and
elsewhere overseas.
Because a lot of these scammers are overseas, watch for signs in e-mail that
the writer’s native language is not English. Bad grammar, odd phrasings, and
misspelled words are red flags. Plus, if the seller really doesn’t know much
about the bike, it’s a scam for sure.
Also, scammers selling bikes will usually ask you to send a down payment, 
or all the money, to an escrow account. And they’ll probably ask you to do it
through Western Union. Don’t do it. The escrow account is phony, and you
have no recourse through Western Union to get your money back.
If you’re selling a bike, you may get e-mail from scammers who will offer to
send you a cashier’s check and probably will want to have a shipper come
pick up the bike. The scammer will give you a check for more than the price
of the bike and ask you to wire the extra money back to him or her. Don’t do
it. The check is phony, and if you wire the cash before the bank tells you the
check is phony, which can take 30 days, you’ll lose your money.
The bottom line is that you must be very cautious about all sellers and
buyers on the Internet. Just delete the e-mail from those folks who appear

e hate to admit it, but motorcyclists also drive cars and trucks. 
That means we know a little bit about motor vehicle insurance. For
instance, we know that we need to maintain minimum coverage or the 
police get pretty upset when they pull us over.
Have you ever really looked at your insurance policy? Do your eyes glaze
over when your insurance agent starts talking about liability insurance, 
comprehensive coverage, collision coverage, and uninsured motorist cover-
age? If you do ignore your insurance policy, and you get all fuzzy-headed
when your agent talks, don’t worry — you’re not alone.
Motor vehicle insurance can be pretty complicated, and it can be even more
complicated when a motorcycle is involved. After all, a motorcycle is a spe-
cial vehicle, and so your bike may have some special insurance needs above
what’s required by law.
In this chapter, you discover the different insurance coverages. You also find
out what’s required by law and what special insurance you may want to get
to protect yourself if you hit someone or someone hits you. It’s important to
understand exactly what coverage you have so that when the time comes 
to call your insurance agent and say, “Oops,” you’ll know exactly what’s 
covered.

Deciphering Your General 
Coverage Options
As you probably know, an insurance policy protects you from having to pay
money from your own pocket to someone you injure or whose property you
damage. It also pays for damage to your own bike. So the first thing you want
to do when you get a bike is to get insurance. Besides helping out your wallet
in case of an accident, purchasing insurance is the law.
When you meet with your insurance agent about buying an insurance policy,
the agent may tell you that state law requires you to have a minimum of
$25,000/$50,000/$15,000 (which is sometimes referred to as 25/50/15) in liabil-
ity coverage in case you hurt someone or damage his or her property. But the
agent may suggest that a successful person like you may want to bump that
coverage up to 50/100/25 or even 100/300/50.
That’s when your eyes glaze over. But it doesn’t have to be that way. The 
following sections show you how to decipher the numbers. These sections
also tell you the other insurance options that are likely to be thrown your
way. (See the later section, “Paying the Price for Insurance,” to find out how
much you’re likely to pay.)
Paying for others: Liability coverage
By law, you generally need to have two kinds of liability insurance: bodily
injury coverage and property damage coverage. Bodily injury coverage pays if
you hurt someone while riding your motorcycle (maybe you crash into a car
and injure the driver, or you run over a pedestrian). Property damage cover-
age pays if you smash up someone’s car, bicycle, or other property with your
bike. Liability coverage is where the strange numbers come into play, too. I
explain all you need to know in the following sections.
25/50/15: Just what does that mean?
When your agent tells you that state law requires you to carry 25/50/15 
liability insurance (which, by the way, is the minimum required in many
states), the agent is simply trying to tell you the following facts:
 Your policy will pay up to $25,000 for each person that you injure, for a
total of $50,000 in a single accident. As you may have noticed, those are
the first two numbers in the 25/50/15 sequence the agent was telling 
you about.
162
Part III: You and Your Machine 

 Your policy will pay up to $15,000 for any damage that you cause to
someone’s property with your bike (say, for example, that you smash
into the side of someone’s car or inadvertently punch a hole through
someone’s nice white picket fence while you’re learning to ride). 
This payment amount corresponds to the third number in the liability
sequence.
A minimum liability coverage amount of 25/50/15 means that your policy 
will pay up to $25,000 for bodily injury, to a maximum of $50,000, and up to
$15,000 for property damage in an accident. So if you hurt two people in a
crash, and their medical bills are $25,000 each, you’re covered. But if you
hurt three people in the crash, and their medical bills are $25,000 each, your
insurance will only cover the costs for two of the people. You need to cough
up the other $25,000.
Opting for more than 25/50/15
Unless you’re really tight on cash, it’s best to opt for more than the minimum
liability coverage (which, as I mention in the previous section, is generally
25/50/15). In fact, it’s best to have at least a 50/100/25 coverage: $50,000 in
bodily injury insurance, with a maximum $100,000 per accident, and $25,000
in property damage coverage.
Why? Well, you have to consider several things:
 Even though your bike is small compared to a car, station wagon, or 
18-wheeler, it can still seriously hurt someone and cause considerable
damage to a vehicle. In fact, a motorcycle can total a car!
 The price of healthcare isn’t getting any cheaper. A person can run up a
$25,000 hospital bill in no time. If the bill goes higher than that, you end
up picking up the tab. After all, you’re liable under the law to make good
on the injuries and damages you cause.
 Your liability insurance pays for the lost income of the person you hurt
as well as for your legal defense if you get sued.
As you can see, the tab for a motorcycle accident can run high pretty quickly.
If you can afford to spend a little more on insurance, another option to con-
sider is an umbrella liability policy. Insurance agents generally offer $1 million
of coverage relatively cheaply, $125 a year or so, and this protection would
kick in after your bike insurance is used up. Plus, this coverage protects you
in case someone makes a liability claim against you related to your house or
car in addition to your motorcycle. Ask your agent for details.
163
Chapter 10: Ensuring You’re Insured

Protecting yourself: Uninsured and 
underinsured motorist coverage
So, you’ve opted for 50/100/25 liability coverage (see the previous section for
details), and you’re feeling good about being protected if you hurt someone.
But wait, what about you? Suppose you’re riding down the road minding your
own business and some bonehead makes a left turn right in front of your
motorcycle, causing a crash. Who pays for your medical bills and for fixing
your bike?
If the driver has the minimum amount of insurance coverage required by law,
and your medical bills far exceed that amount, you would have to foot the 
bill for the portion that the driver’s insurance doesn’t cover. Sure, you can
sue, but if the driver has minimum insurance coverage, he or she probably
doesn’t have any money or assets to sue for. The same is true if your totaled
motorcycle is — or rather was — worth more than the driver’s insurance
would cover for property damage. What do you do now?
The answer is simple: Before you head out on the road, purchase uninsured
and underinsured motorist coverage. This type of coverage provides you 
with protection if you were to get hit by an uninsured or underinsured driver
or a hit-and-run driver. This coverage picks up the tab for your injuries or 
the damage to your bike if the driver who hit you has no insurance, or has
insurance with lower payouts than what your medical bills and property
damage amount to. The policy probably would cover your lost wages as well.
Some states require you to buy uninsured and underinsured motorist cover-
age. But, if your state doesn’t require it, buy it anyway. To find out if your
state requires this type of coverage, ask your agent for details. And remem-
ber those numbers we talked about earlier: 50/100/25? Here’s where you’ll
see them again, and they mean the same thing except this time you’re the
person benefiting from the numbers.
In about half the nation’s states, the uninsured and underinsured motorist
coverage includes both bodily injury and property protection (that is, cover-
age if your bike gets smashed up). That’s where you’ll see the 50/100/25
sequence. In the other half of the states, property protection isn’t offered as
part of the uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage. In those states,
the numbers would just be 50/100. The 50/100 means that if you and a pas-
senger are hit by a hit-and-run driver, for example, your insurance policy will
pay your medical bills up to $50,000, and your passenger’s medical bills up 
to $50,000, for a total of $100,000. If you opt for collision coverage, which I
discuss later in this chapter, you won’t need the property protection portion
of the uninsured and underinsured coverage if it’s offered in your state.
164

Fixing your bike: Collision coverage
Imagine that you’re learning how to ride your new motorcycle (happy day,
isn’t it?). You hop on the bike, twist the throttle, and immediately make a 
beeline for the nearest tree. “Oh great,” you think, “now the front end of my
new bike is all smashed up.”
Hopefully you thought ahead and bought collision insurance, which pays 
to fix damage caused by yourself or others to your motorcycle. Collision
insurance is great for all sorts of situations. For instance, if you smash into a
tree, your bike is covered. If an uninsured driver hits you, yup, your bike is
covered. If you come out of the grocery store to find your bike smashed up
because someone backed into it and then sped off, you’re covered.
If you took out a loan to buy a new bike, the loan company probably requires
you to have collision coverage. Why? They consider the bike to be collateral.
Until you pay off the loan the bank actually owns the bike. Talk to your loan
company to find out if it has this requirement because some loan companies
don’t use motorcycles as collateral.
165
Chapter 10: Ensuring You’re Insured
“It’s not my fault”: Getting to 
know no-fault insurance
Some states have no-fault insurance, where a
person’s own insurance company is supposed
to pay for the injuries that he or she suffers.
Motorcyclists are generally exempt from no-
fault requirements. But in those states, motor-
cyclists generally are required to buy personal
injury protection insurance, which pays for their
healthcare if they suffer injuries.
No-fault laws are very complex. So speak with
your insurance agent for a full understanding of
the law in your state. For example, some states
include personal injury protection and property
damage protection in their no-fault coverage,
and some only include personal injury protec-
tion. So if you want property protection you
need to speak to your agent before you get in an
accident, or you could end up having to pay to
repair your bike yourself. Some no-fault states
don’t require you to have no-fault insurance, but
they still require you to have liability insurance.
Also, your state’s no-fault policy may cover lost
wages and funeral expenses, and it may not.
In addition, all the no-fault states put some kind
of limits on what drivers and riders can sue
each other for in the case of a crash. Usually
you’re only allowed to sue if your medical
expenses reach a certain threshold or your
injuries are severe. Be sure you understand
those limits and the limits of your company-pro-
vided or purchased health plan so you know
that your medical expenses will be taken care
of if you’re in a catastrophic crash.

If you have a relatively new (read: expensive) bike, it’s a good idea to have
collision coverage. But if your bike is old and only worth, say $500, it may not
be worth buying this type of coverage — especially if you opt for a policy
that has a $250 deductible. (The deductible is the amount of money you have
to kick in before the insurance company pays for the rest. Choosing a higher
deductible results in a lower premium payment for you.) After all, who wants
to spend $250 to fix a $500 bike?
Saving your bike from other damage:
Comprehensive coverage
It’s a sad fact that motorcycles are stolen. If you don’t take the proper precau-
tions, two or three goons can just lift up your motorcycle, throw it in the 
back of their pickup truck, and drive off. Oh, and some people find it fun to
vandalize other people’s transportation. (I cover how to keep your bike from
getting stolen in Chapter 16.)
If you want to be able to protect yourself, your bike, and your wallet, be sure
to buy comprehensive coverage for your bike. This type of coverage pays for
your bike if it’s stolen, or pays to repair it if it’s vandalized or burns up. You’ll
have to pay a deductible, but if you have a newer bike, this coverage will save
you money in the longrun. And don’t forget that the amount of the deductible
you choose determines the premium you pay.
As with collision coverage, it’s up to you to decide whether your motorcycle
is worth enough to warrant comprehensive coverage. The newer the bike, the
more likely it is that you should buy this insurance. Comprehensive coverage
is something that you would get in addition to your liability and collision 
coverage.
Something to keep in mind for both collision and comprehensive insurance
coverage is that the motorcycle owner and the insurance company generally
have different ideas about the value of the bike when it comes time to pay 
on a claim. Generally an insurance company will pay for the value of a stock
machine that’s the same age as yours. So don’t expect to get a new bike if
your 5-year-old machine burns up. Similarly, don’t expect to get enough
money to replace the $800 saddlebags you just installed.
To avoid these types of disputes with the insurance company (when you’re
already flaming mad), figure out the value of your bike and get it straight with
your agent before you go and crash. Check out the later section, “Insuring
your custom parts and riding gear,” to find out how to get insurance for your
custom equipment.

Part III: You and Your Machine 

Purchasing Motorcycle-Specific
Insurance Coverage
In the previous section, I discuss insurance coverages that apply to cars as
well as bikes. But, like the people who ride them, bikes are special, and so
they have some special insurance needs. Read on for the important details.
Looking after your passenger
One vital area to pay attention to when dealing with insurance is medical 
coverage for your passenger, who usually will be a loved one, or at least
someone you’re fond of. Passenger liability coverage (which is called guest
passenger liability by some insurance companies) is a type of coverage you
should seriously consider having. It pays for injuries suffered by your 
passenger in a crash. There have been plenty of cases where a passenger 
was seriously injured in a crash and sued the motorcycle operator.
Passenger liability coverage is an area where you need to speak with your
insurance agent and understand completely what he or she tells you. Why?
Because passenger liability coverage is handled differently by different 
insurance companies. Some insurance companies offer passenger protection
as part of its regular liability coverage. Other companies require that you buy
separate passenger coverage. And some companies won’t cover a spouse as
a passenger, which is a mystery to me (and most motorcyclists). So, be sure
to know what your policy covers before you carry any passengers.
Insuring your custom parts and riding gear
So you’ve bought a nice new cruiser and decided to make it your own by 
bolting on a lot of chrome parts, giving it a splashy paint job, adding great
looking, but very expensive, saddlebags, and opening your wallet to buy new
custom wheels at $1,000 a pop. Oh, and don’t forget that new $800 leather
jacket and great $600 helmet that you’re sporting. After you’ve spent that
much money, I’m guessing you’d like to protect your investment. But how do
you insure that stuff?
Well, here’s the scoop: Most insurance companies offer optional equipment
coverage. This type of insurance pays for the covered parts or gear if they
happen to get stolen or damaged. Ask your agent for details, and then decide
whether you want to pay the premium or take the chance of losing your
expensive gear through theft or a crash.
167
Chapter 10: Ensuring You’re Insured

Finding coverage for your dirt bike
Because dirt bikes aren’t ridden on streets, no insurance is required to ride
them. Also, if you’re injured while riding a dirt bike, your medical coverage
will typically cover your injuries (unless you were practicing for, or taking
part in, a race or other “speed contest,” or the coverage specifically excludes
motorcycle-related injuries).
A lot of people believe that their homeowner’s insurance will cover the theft
of their dirt bike if it’s stolen out of their garage. Not true. You need to get
separate comprehensive or theft insurance that’s designed specifically for
the bike. You may be able to get liability insurance for a dirt bike (say, for
example, you accidentally run over a hunter while you’re cruising through
the backcountry), but you definitely can’t get collision coverage. After all, it’s
a motorcycle made for riding in the woods and in the dirt. It’s going to get
dropped and bounced off trees. Insurance companies know the risks, so talk
to your agent and shop around, but don’t expect to get much coverage.
Know What Your Medical Insurance 
Will (and Won’t) Cover
Suppose you decided not to get uninsured or underinsured motorist cover-
age (which I explain earlier in this chapter) because you figured that the
healthcare plan offered by your employer or union would pay for your 
medical care if you’re hit by a person who doesn’t have enough insurance.
Well, that may be true. Or it may not be.
In this section, I clue you in to the potential hassles and pitfalls you may
encounter by assuming too much on the part of your health insurance 
carrier. Read the info in this section and then check your policy.
Read the fine print: Finding out if 
motorcycle injuries are covered
Discrimination exists against motorcyclists, and the health insurance 
industry is one place you’ll find it. For instance, some healthcare plans
offered by employers and unions have exclusions that spell out what 
injuries are excluded from coverage. Sometimes these exclusions include
motorcycle-related injuries.
168
Part III: You and Your Machine 

Go right now and check your medical insurance policy. Do you see a section
that lists the exclusions? Read it carefully to see if motorcycle-related injuries
are covered. Can’t figure it out? Ask your human resources director. Each year
too many motorcyclists fail to check their policies until after they’re seriously
hurt in a single-vehicle crash, or they’re hit by an uninsured driver. Only then
do they find out that their medical care isn’t covered. Then these motorcy-
clists have to pay tens of thousands of dollars out of their own pockets.
Congress passed a law a decade ago that barred health insurance companies
from discriminating against motorcyclists, horseback riders, skiers, and
others when it comes to covering their medical injuries. Congress made it
clear that if someone got hurt riding a motorcycle or taking part in other
legal recreational activities, their injuries must be covered.
Well, apparently Congress didn’t make its intent clear enough. When federal
bureaucrats wrote the rules to carry out the law, they said that health insur-
ance companies must provide health insurance for motorcyclists, but they
don’t have to pay for motorcycle-related injuries. Motorcycling groups are
lobbying Congress to close that loophole, and they have bills introduced in
both the U.S. House and U.S. Senate. But until that law changes, you need to
know what your health plan does and doesn’t cover.
Beware of potential lawsuits and 
the hassles that come with them
Even if your plan covers motorcycle injuries, your health insurance company
may consider itself a secondary insurer, meaning that it considers the person
who hit you as the one having the primary responsibility for paying your
medical bills. So, you may have to sue the person who hit you before your
health insurance will start paying any bills.
Lawsuits take a lot of time and aggravation, and if you don’t have the money
to pay in the meantime, bill collectors may continue to knock at your door
during the long process. Avoid the hassle. Get uninsured and underinsured
motorist coverage (see the earlier section, “Protecting yourself: Uninsured
and underinsured motorist coverage,” for details).
Paying the Price for Insurance
You would think (or at least hope) that you could simply walk into the office
of an insurance agent, plop down some cash, and walk out with an insurance
169
Chapter 10: Ensuring You’re Insured

policy that covers your bike. Well, it isn’t that simple. Not all insurance com-
panies insure motorcycles, and some that do charge outrageous rates to dis-
courage motorcyclists from seeking coverage from them.
Even more so than with your car insurance, it pays to shop around when
you’re looking to insure your bike. Some companies are very motorcycle-
friendly and offer a variety of coverages, including optional equipment cover-
age, at reasonable rates. Others don’t really want your business, especially 
if you’re a young rider. These companies charge yearly premiums equal to
half the cost of a new bike or more. To avoid overpaying, know exactly what
coverages you want, and then go shopping.
How companies determine what you’ll pay
A lot of people believe that the cost of motorcycle insurance is high, and it
can be, depending on a lot of factors. But remember that insurance compa-
nies aren’t in the business of insuring your bike; they’re in the business of
making money. So to decide what rate to charge you, they look at what
they’ve paid in claims for riders your age, on your bike, in your area, with
your credit. They throw in plenty of other factors as well. Because of all these
different factors, I can’t give you specific insurance rates for the type of
motorcycle you have or are considering buying.
Rate determination is complex, but some facts can give you a better idea of
what you can expect to pay to insure your bike. For instance, you’ll likely pay
more for insurance if you fall into any of the following categories:
 You’re a young rider. Young riders tend to pay much more than older
riders because of their lack of riding experience.
 You have a bad driving record. If you don’t clean up your driving
record, you’re likely to pay up to three times more than a rider with a
clean record.
 You ride a sportbike. If you prefer sportbikes, you’ll probably pay more
than a cruiser rider. Why? There’s a lot of expensive plastic bodywork
on those machines.
 You have bad credit. Surprisingly, at least one motorcycle-friendly
insurance company uses credit history to help determine the rates that
apply to motorcyclists. The company’s research shows that riders with
poor credit are more likely to make claims.
So, if you’re older, you don’t ride a sportbike, and you have a good driving
record and excellent credit, congratulations! You’ll probably get the lowest
rate. Even for you, though, it pays to shop around.
170
Part III: You and Your Machine 

Getting insurance relief by 
being a savvy shopper
If you’re a savvy shopper, you can cut your cost of insurance. For instance,
get quotes that include deductibles of $100, $250, $500, or even $1,000. The
higher your deductible, the lower your premium.
A high deductible may give you a low insurance premium, but if you total
your bike be prepared to shell out your deductible amount to replace your
machine. If you don’t think you can handle the high deductible if your bike
gets smashed up, it may be best to have a lower deductible and pay a higher
premium. Sure you’ll be spending more money on insurance every month,
but if the worst happens and your bike gets totaled, at least you can get
another one with little cash outlay.
Some insurers also offer discounts for purchasing all your coverage from
them. For example, these companies may offer a nice discount if you insure
your home, your car, and your motorcycle with them. And some provide a 
discount merely for being a member of the American Motorcyclist Association
or for passing an approved safety training course. When shopping around for
insurance, be sure to ask about any discounts available.
171
Chapter 10: Ensuring You’re Insured
In motorcycle coverage, location is key
Several years ago I did research into the cost of
motorcycle insurance around the country for
riders of various ages riding different types of
machines. The results were surprising. For exam-
ple, a 19-year-old man with a new sportbike in Los
Angeles could expect to pay more than $14,000
per year for liability, collision, comprehensive,
and uninsured motorist coverage from one com-
pany. The minimum coverage required by law
would be almost $700. In Indianapolis, on the
other hand, that same rider could get full cover-
age (liability, collision, comprehensive, and unin-
sured motorist coverage) for less than $1,300 from
a different company. The state-required minimum
from the same company was under $200.
In contrast, a 45-year-old male riding a big touring
bike could get full coverage for as low as $810 in
Los Angeles, and the state-required minimum
coverage would cost him just $58. In Indianapolis,
that same rider could get full coverage for $188
and the state-required minimum for $23.
Now compare those rates to a 36-year-old
female rider on a big cruiser. She could get full
coverage for as low as $900 in Los Angeles, with
the state minimum coverage costing just $82. In
Indianapolis, that rider would pay just $207 for full
coverage and $23 for the state minimum.
So where you live really has a lot to do with
determining your insurance premiums. And so do
all those other factors, of course. Before buying
a new bike, shop around for insurance. You may
find that your dream bike has to remain just that,
a dream, at least for a while because the insur-
ance premiums would be more than you can
afford.

Keeping Your Bike 
in Tiptop Shape
In This Chapter
 Surveying the tools you need
 Doing routine maintenance work yourself
 Allowing someone else to do the work
 Prepping your bike for winter storage and spring riding
U
nlike most car drivers and their cars, many motorcyclists love everything
about motorcycling and their motorcycles. Not only do they love riding
them, talking about them, and staring at them, but they also love working on
them. And you don’t need to be a master mechanic to have fun working on
your bike. You just need some basic tools and a good service manual.
Motorcyclists assume that all their compatriots do their own routine mainte-
nance, and few expect anyone to really do more, so just a little knowledge
can get you a lot of respect in the motorcycling world.
People will still respect you even if decide you’d rather take your bike to the
shop for maintenance work. After all, what matters in the motorcycling world
is that you ride a motorcycle, not that you work on one. However, you’ll most
definitely lose respect if you try to tackle mechanical jobs that you can’t
handle. You’ll then find yourself having to go to a shop anyway, but this time,
they’ll be fixing what you messed up.
Although today’s motorcycles are complex machines that take a skilled
mechanic to cure such things as electrical problems, you can still master the
routine work the bike requires. Mastering the routine work, such as changing
the oil, lubing the chain, and changing the brake pads, can pay off not only in
keeping your bike running at its best but also in saving money that you other-
wise would have to fork over to a motorcycle mechanic.
If you’re feeling overwhelmed because you don’t have a handy bone in your
body, don’t worry. This chapter gives you a handle on the basic tools that
you need to maintain your motorcycle and some of the tools that are available
if you want to try to do some more advanced work. This chapter also tells you

174
Part III: You and Your Machine 
when it may be a good idea to pay someone else to do work on your bike
rather than do it yourself (even if you feel qualified to do it). In fact, if you can
afford it, go ahead and pay someone else to do the work even if you can do it
yourself. This helps keep the motorcycling industry thriving. Finally, in this
chapter you get guidance on how to prepare your machine for long winter
storage and how to get it ready to go for the riding season, which starts in
the spring.
Toolin’ Around: Having the 
Right Tools for the Job
You don’t need to get buckets of tools to perform routine maintenance on
your motorcycle — a few tools will do the trick (provided they’re the right
ones). But you may find yourself acquiring more and more tools as your skill
level increases and you tackle tougher jobs. Whether you plan to stick with
basic maintenance or tackle tougher jobs, it’s always best to have a good mix
of tools so that you have one within reach no matter what nut or bolt you
want to separate from your bike.
Be sure to get good quality tools. It doesn’t do you much good to get cheap
ones that don’t fit nuts and bolts well or that break, forcing you to head back to
the store to shell out more money. It’s also best to get screwdrivers with non-
slip grips, because your hands will get sweaty and even oily. And while smooth,
chrome wrenches aren’t a necessity, but they sure feel good when you hold
them. Finally, remember not to use American wrenches on metric bolts — they
don’t fit, and you’ll just round off the head of the bolt.
Generally, you want tools that have some weight to them when you hold
them. Tools with lifetime guarantees, such as Craftsman available from Sears,
are always a good bet because if they break you can get them replaced for
free. I have seen sockets crack trying to get off swingarm nuts.
The following sections highlight the basic tools you definitely need for rou-
tine maintenance. I also throw in some advanced tools that you may want
depending on how much maintenance you plan to do yourself.
Taking stock of the basic tools
If you plan to do any routine maintenance on your bike, you want to make
sure that you’re prepared with the right tools, which you can buy just about
anywhere: Sears, hardware stores, and auto parts stores. The following list
outlines the basic tools that you need and some specifics about each:

 Screwdrivers: A motorcyclist should have both flathead and Phillips
screwdrivers. Screwdrivers with magnetized heads are best. And you
want to have a variety of sizes so that you’re sure to have the right size
for the job. The screwdrivers should fit into the slots of your fasteners
snugly; otherwise, you could end up wrecking the head of the bolt that
you’re trying to loosen. In that case, you’ll have to resort to a drill to get
the bolt out.
Get at least one flathead and Phillips screwdriver in the following sizes:
No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3. So you should start out with at least six screw-
drivers. Besides getting a variety of sizes in the heads of screwdrivers,
you also want a variety of lengths. Motorcycles are pretty compact
machines, and some of the bolts that you need to loosen may be in tight,
hard-to-reach places. So you’re sure to need short screwdrivers as well
as long ones.
 Wrenches: Combination wrenches (see Figure 11-1), which have an open
end and a boxed (or closed) end, are a must. Make sure you buy these
wrenches in metric sizes if your machine uses metric nuts and bolts
(and most do). If you ride an American Harley-Davidson, of course, then
you will need American, or SAE, tools. If you get sizes 6 through 22 (in
metric sizes) you should be able to loosen and tighten just about every
nut and bolt on your bike. In American, start with a set of combination
wrenches that are 1⁄4-, 3⁄8-, 7⁄16-, ⁄2-, and 9⁄16-inch.

Chapter 11: Keeping Your Bike in Tiptop Shape

A good set of Allen wrenches, or hex keys, is also important, because a
lot of bikes now use Allen screws or bolts to hold on the bodywork (and
in some other places). It’s best to get T-handle Allen wrenches (see
Figure 11-2) because they give you the leverage you need to apply
torque to loosen stubborn bolts. Plus, the L-shaped Allen wrenches
sometimes leave little space when you need to put the short end into
the bolt so you can put leverage on the long end. The result? You can
end up gouging your expensive plastic bodywork.
In metric sizes, get an 8mm, 10mm, 12mm, 13mm, 14mm, 17mm, and
19mm. For American, start with 5⁄32-, 3⁄16-, 1⁄4-, and 5⁄16-inch. You will need a
metric 10mm for your battery bolts on your American bike. You may
also need some Torx wrenches for your machine. Start with a T25, a T27,
and a T40.
 Ratchets and a socket set: You’ll need some ratchets and a good socket
set, again ranging in metric size from 6 through 22 or 24. It’s best to get
large and small ratchets as well as one or two that pivot at the head so
you can get into hard-to-reach places. For American bikes, get sockets in
sizes 3⁄8-, 7⁄16-, 1⁄2-, 9⁄16-, 5⁄8-, 11⁄16-, and 3⁄4-inch. It’s also a good idea to have a 1⁄4-
inch ratchet drive as well as a 3⁄8-inch drive. You’ll find that bigger sockets
are made for a 3⁄8-inch drive ratchet. Also, if you get a 1⁄4-inch ratchet and
a 3⁄8-inch ratchet, you know that your ratchet will fit any socket you buy.
You should also get a couple extension bars for your ratchet, such as a 
5-inch and a 10-inch for those hard-to-reach places. T-handle sockets
aren’t critical, but they’re definitely fun to have. And like T-handle Allen
wrenches, they look cool.
Figure 11-2:

Part III: You and Your Machine 

 Torque wrench: A good torque wrench is essential. Your owner’s or ser-
vice manual will give the torque specs for all the critical fasteners on
your machine. A torque wrench that measures 10 to 80 foot pounds is
sufficient for a motorcycle.
Be sure to torque your fasteners back to the manufacturer’s specifications
after you loosen them. The last thing you want is your brake caliper falling
off because you failed to torque the bolts holding them on and they
vibrated loose as you happily cruised down the highway at 65 mph.
 Other miscellaneous tools: Pliers, vise grips, funnels, a spark plug
wrench, an oil filter wrench, a battery charger, and a chain breaker (for
when you need to replace your drive chain; see Figure 11-3) are also
useful. And don’t forget a tire-pressure gauge. The cheap, pencil kind
work just fine.
When you work on your motorcycle at home in your garage, use the tools that
are in the toolkit on your bike. That way you know that if you break down
alongside the road, you have the tools you need to fix the problem. While
working on your bike at home, you may find that the toolkit doesn’t include a
proper-sized wrench or screwdriver. In that case, just add one to the kit.
Adding advanced tools to your collection
Specialized tools for motorcycles are available, but I warn you that they can
be quite pricey. Do you need them? That’s up to you to decide. It depends on
how much work you choose to do on your bike. If you like to work with your
hands and get a little greasy, you may want to look into investing in these
more advanced tools. However, if you prefer to leave the tougher stuff to the
pro mechanics at the dealership, feel free to skip this section.
Figure 11-3:
A chain
breaker.
177
Chapter 11: Keeping Your Bike in Tiptop Shape

When you do feel ready to buy some of the advanced tools, make sure you
weigh the cost of the tool against the number of times you expect to use it,
especially if it’s a tool that only works on one model of motorcycle. For instance,
if you don’t plan to ever take the wheels off your bike, there’s no need for you to
buy a stand or lift. And if you don’t plan to change your own tires, and few
motorcyclists do on streetbikes, you don’t need to buy a tire-changing rig.
Here are some of the advanced tools you may want to purchase:
 Front-end and rear-end stands (shown in Figure 11-4): Sooner or later
your motorcycle’s tires will wear out. When that happens, the best thing
to do is to remove your wheels, take them to a motorcycle shop, and let
the mechanics put on new tires. In fact, a lot of dealers offer free installa-
tion if you buy the tires from them and bring in your rims. So, when
you’re in the market for new tires, you’re bound to need front-end and
rear-end stands.
These stands lift up the front and rear of your bike. After your bike is
raised, you just slide out the axles and the wheels come off. (Don’t forget
to loosen the big axle nuts before you lift the bike. Otherwise, when you
put your big ol’ wrench on that big axle nut and yank on the wrench to
loosen the nut the wheel will spin.) Check out the later section,
“Changing your tires,” for more info. Front-end and rear-end stands are
also useful for when you need to change your brake pads, because the
wheels may have to come off to do that.
Figure 11-4:
Front- and
rear-end
stands.
178
Part III: You and Your Machine 

These stands are particularly popular for use on sportbikes that lack
centerstands. They attach to your bike and then lever the bike up into a
stable position. If you have a cruiser, you may not be able to find stands
that will work for your bike. In that case, you need to get a motorcycle
jack, which works like a car jack but is designed to lift a motorcycle.
 Lift: If you can afford it, you may want to consider investing in a full-
length motorcycle lift for when you tinker with your bike. A lift (shown
in Figure 11-5) makes it a lot easier to get to the stuff that’s low and
under your bike.
Saving Some Bucks by Maintaining
Your Own Bike
All motorcycles have the same basic routine maintenance needs: oil changes,
brake fluid and brake pad changes, chain and battery maintenance, and air
filter changes or cleanings. While this is routine stuff, it’s also critical because
a failure in one of these areas could leave you stranded on the road or could
be dangerous to you, the rider.
When armed with the proper tools, a motorcyclist can do all the routine
maintenance a motorcycle needs. Not only is maintaining a bike fun, but with
shop prices around $60 an hour or more, it also can save some big money.
Although some of the maintenance may seem intimidating at first, after you
do it a couple of times it will be easy. So don’t count yourself out yet. Just
take your time, and closely follow the instructions in this section and in your
owner’s manual and service manual.

Changing fluids
Imagine the innards of your motorcycle engine. There are an awful lot of
metal parts scraping together. If you want those parts to last, they must be
bathed in oil. Without oil, your motor will turn into a melted heap of fused
parts in no time. Even with oil, there’s a chance that there are metal shavings
being pushed around that have come off the parts that are scraping together.
So, frequent oil changes are vital for keeping your motor happy.
While engine oil is the most critical fluid that needs to be changed on a
motorcycle, there are other fluids that need attention as well. Most motorcy-
clists don’t change those fluids as often as they should. Fork oil, which helps
your front suspension work, is probably the most ignored fluid. But brake
fluid ranks right up there. Failure to change those fluids won’t lead to disaster
like failing to change your motor oil, which can’t protect your engine when it
is degraded, but it’s still important to change them to keep your front suspen-
sion and brakes working their best.
Changing the engine oil is an easy task and takes about half an hour.
Changing fork oil, on the other hand, is very difficult and may require special
tools, so it’s best left to professionals. Changing brake fluid isn’t very difficult
but it’s time-consuming, so expect to spend a couple hours at that chore. Or,
to play it safe, have it done by professionals. After all, brakes are critical for
safety and you want it done right. There’s no shame in having a pro do the
work; after all, safety should be your primary concern.
Motor oil
Probably the most common routine maintenance done by motorcyclists is
the oil change. Changing your bike’s oil is relatively easy to do. And it’s also
empowering: You feel good knowing that you’ve removed any metal shavings
that may be floating around in the old oil when you drain it and that your
bike has brand new oil to lubricate its internals.
To change your oil, follow these steps (however, be sure to refer to your
owner’s or service manual to ensure you do it right):
1. Park your bike on a flat surface on the side stand, with the bike in
gear so that there’s no chance you’ll bump it and knock it off the
stand.
2. Loosen the drain plug under the motor with a socket wrench.
Don’t remove the drain plug. You want it to keep the oil in the motor for
now. Loosen it with a wrench and then with your fingers until a little oil
starts coming out, and then tighten the bolt up hand tight. You loosen it
now, so that you don’t have to struggle with it later when the motor is
hot. You don’t want to burn yourself.
180
Part III: You and Your Machine 

3. Start your motorcycle.
Let the bike run for three to five minutes to heat up the oil and make it
thinner. That way, the oil will drain well.
4. Put an oil catch container under your motorcycle.
Make sure that the container you choose is big enough to hold all the oil
that will drain out of the bike. Normally, a bike will hold four or five quarts.
5. Carefully reach under the bike, with a gloved hand, and twist off the
drain plug.
If you’re unlucky, you’ll drop the plug into the catch basin as hot oil
comes streaming out of your bike. In that case, just fish it out after all
the oil drains out of the bike.
Be careful during this step because the motor is hot. And note that no
matter how careful you are, you probably will get some hot oil on your
hand. To avoid burns, wear a work glove.
6. Remove the oil filler cap and tilt the bike straight up off its sidestand
so that all the oil can flow out into the catch basin.
Tilting the bike upright helps ensure you get all of the oil possible out of
the motor. If you leave the bike tilted on its sidestand, oil can remain on
the side away from the drain hole.
7. Remove the old oil filter and install a new one.
There will be a gasket on the old filter, so make sure you get that off the
bike as well. It usually comes off with the old filter, but sometimes it
sticks to the motor.
When installing the new filter, rub new motor oil on the gasket on the
new filter, tighten the filter by hand, and then use an oil filter wrench to
tighten it to the bike manufacturer’s recommendation, which is usually
two and a half more turns.
It’s best to buy an oil filter wrench from a dealership specifically for your
bike rather than to try to use a universal one, or even one made for cars.
Motorcycle oil filters are usually shoehorned into pretty tight spaces so
they’re a lot easier to get on and off with wrenches made specifically for
them.
8. Reinstall the drain plug and torque it to the manufacturer’s recom-
mendation.
Making sure the drain plug is tight is critical because if the drain plug
isn’t tight enough it could vibrate loose while you’re riding down the
road, spewing an oily mess onto your rear tire, and the road. That could
be big, big trouble.
181
Chapter 11: Keeping Your Bike in Tiptop Shape

9. Using a funnel, pour in the proper amount of oil and reinstall the oil
filler cap.
You can determine how much oil to add to the bike by consulting your
owner’s or service manual. Bikes usually hold four or five quarts.
10. Start up the bike, and look for leaking oil at the drain plug and oil filter.
If you discover any leaks, shut off the bike, tighten the part where the
leak is, and start the bike again.
Congratulations! Now you’re good for another 3,000 to 5,000 miles or more,
depending on what your owner’s or service manual says.
Radiator fluid
If your bike is water-cooled, you’ll have to change the radiator fluid at inter-
vals specified by your owner’s or service manual. Usually bikes require a
radiator fluid change every two years. This task really isn’t that difficult.
However, it may be time-consuming to remove the bodywork to get to the
radiator. Expect to spend an hour doing this work.
To change the radiator fluid, follow these steps:
1. Park the motorcycle on a flat surface and put it on the sidestand with
the bike in gear.
You want the bike in gear so that if you accidentally bump the bike it
won’t roll off the sidestand and tip over.
182
Part III: You and Your Machine 
Spend now to save later
Do you need to use expensive motorcycle-spe-
cific motor oil in your bike, or can you use less-
expensive car oil? Opt for motorcycle oil. Really,
it’s only a couple of bucks more, and it contains
more anti-wear additives than car oil; plus it’s
better for the operation of your clutch, which is
bathed in the oil. The question also comes up
whether to use petroleum-based or synthetic
motor oil. Synthetic motor oil costs more but is
supposed to be better for your machine. There’s
no way for me to prove that, but I always put
synthetic motor oil in my bikes. Finally, some
motorcyclists may tell you that you can save a
few bucks by finding a car oil filter that will fit
your motorcycle. Don’t take the chance to save
a few bucks; buy an oil filter made specifically
for your motorcycle. Bottom line: Spending a
few extra dollars upfront saves you money in
the long run by ensuring a better-running bike.

2. Remove the radiator drain plug and drain the fluid into a container.
Tilt the bike upright to get all the fluid out.
Sometimes the lowest point on the radiator is actually a bottom hose.
You can unclamp that to drain the radiator instead of using the drain
plug, and then you don’t need to tilt the bike upright.
3. Fill the radiator with distilled water. After filling the radiator with
water, run the bike for two or three minutes to heat it up, and then
drain it again.
A lot of motorcyclists skip this step, and you can too, unless you’re the
type of person who wants to be thorough.
Don’t remove the radiator fill cap because you could get scalded.
4. Refill the radiator with the proper mix of radiator fluid and distilled
water, usually 50/50.
You can determine the proper mix of fluids by consulting your owner’s
or service manual. If your radiator has an expansion tank, put the
proper mix of radiator fluid and distilled water in there so that it’s
between the two level lines marked on the tank. The expansion tank is
just like the one on your car, with the same two lines.
5. Ride the bike around for about 10 minutes and then park it in your
garage to let it cool off.
After it’s cool, check the fluid level in the radiator again and top it off, if
necessary.
Fork oil
You should replace your fork oil on the schedule recommended by the bike’s
manufacturer, normally every two years. (Fork oil has nothing to do with
your kitchen utensils. It’s a special oil that goes in your forks to help the sus-
pension work. When fork oil wears out, the internals of your forks can suffer
more wear, and your suspension may feel mushy.)
Many motorcyclists never replace their bike’s fork oil, but it really is worth it
to keep your suspension in tiptop shape. Because this task can be difficult to
do without the correct tools, it’s best left to the professionals. However, if
you want to tackle the job, expect to spend a couple of hours doing it. And
have your service manual handy to help guide you through the steps.
Know what kind of forks you have: a damping-rod fork that uses the fork oil
for damping (controlling how quickly a fork moves up and down) or a more
modern cartridge fork, which has a cartridge at the bottom of the fork tube to
help control damping. The two types of forks require two slightly different
techniques for changing the fork oil. Plus, if you have telescopic forks or
upside-down forks, you may need to do things differently.

Chapter 11: Keeping Your Bike in Tiptop Shape

Maintaining the brakes
Brakes are obviously a critical component of any motorcycle, yet they’re
often neglected by motorcyclists. In order to maintain your brakes properly,
you need to change the brake pads and the brake fluid regularly. This section
gives you the lowdown.
Changing the brake pads
Changing your brake pads isn’t terribly difficult; it generally takes about half
an hour. To change them, you just have to follow these easy steps:
1. Remove the wheel.
If you can just unbolt the caliper and pull it away from the brake disc
without removing the wheel, that’s great.
2. Remove the pads from the caliper.
Some brake pads are held in the caliper with a tension wire that acts as
a spring. If your caliper is like this, note the position of the spring before
you remove it so that you put it back the correct way. The pads also may
have an anti-squeal metal backing. Make sure that comes out with the
pad.
3. Install your new pads.
If your caliper has springs to hold the pads, make sure you reinstall
those also.
4. Reinstall the caliper.
The only difficult part of changing your brake pads is getting the pads
back into the caliper. After all, the new pads will be thicker than the ones
you removed, so you’ll have to carefully force the new pads back into
the caliper to allow enough room for your disc to fit in the caliper. Using
a large flathead screwdriver is one way to force the pads into the caliper
to create room for the disc.
5. Reinstall the wheel if you removed it.
If you wait too long to change your brake pads, the backing to the pads,
which is metal, will cut into your brake disc, cutting grooves into it and
maybe even destroying it if you let that go on too long.
Changing the brake fluid
Motorcyclists are generally good about changing the brake pads, but many
aren’t so good at regularly changing the disc brake fluid, which can absorb
water over time and become less effective. How will you know? The brakes
will feel mushy.
184
Part III: You and Your Machine 

Changing the fluid takes about an hour. Depending on the location of the
calipers and how much room you have to reach the front brake lever and rear
brake pedal on your bike, changing the brake fluid can require two people.
To change your brake fluid, follow these instructions:
1. Park your bike on a flat surface, put it in gear, and turn the handle-
bars so that the front brake master cylinder on the handlebar is as
upright as possible.
If you need the master cylinder to be even more upright, loosen the
bolts holding it to the handlebar and twist it; then snug up the bolts.
2. Prepare for bleeding the caliper that you’re working on.
Each brake caliper has a fitting that unscrews to allow brake fluid out.
Attach a correct-sized tube to that fitting with the tube running down
into a plastic container.
3. Clean the cap on the master cylinder with soap and water. After
removing the cap from the brake-fluid master-cylinder reservoir, pull
in the front brake lever (or depress the rear brake lever, depending
on which brake you’re working on) and loosen the fitting on the
brake caliper to allow fluid to bleed out. Then snug up the fitting and
release the lever.
Don’t let the fluid in the reservoir drain down very far. If you do, you’ll
get air in your system, which results in a spongy feel to the brakes. Also,
you want to be sure you snug up the fitting before you release the lever
because, otherwise, it will suck air into your system. You want to clean
the master-cylinder cap before removing it because you don’t want any
dirt to fall into the reservoir and contaminate the brake fluid.
Keep repeating this process of pulling or depressing the lever, loosening
the caliper fitting to let fluid out, tightening the fitting, and releasing the
lever, keeping the master-cylinder reservoir topped off with fresh brake
fluid, until you’re confident that all the old brake fluid has been replaced
with new fluid.
4. Replace the brake reservoir cap, reposition your front brake master
cylinder if you moved it, and then pump the brake lever to rebuild
the pressure in the system.
Failure to rebuild the pressure in your brake system will result in having
no brakes the first time you need them. Also, dispose of any leftover
brake fluid. Brake fluid absorbs water, so you don’t want to take the
chance that the fluid will get contaminated before you need it again,
which will be in a year or two. Finally, if your brakes feel mushy or
spongy after you change the fluid, it means you got air in the system and
must change the fluid again.

Taking care of the chain
Most motorcycles today transfer power from the motor to the rear wheel
with a chain, and that chain requires a bit of maintenance. However, more
and more cruisers are being outfitted with a maintenance-free belt to transfer
the power. Other motorcycles are equipped with a shaft to transfer the
power, which also requires little attention. If you do have a shaft or chain,
here’s the stuff that you have to take care of: lubing and tightening the chain,
and changing the shaft oil at intervals and levels recommended by the motor-
cycle manufacturer. I explain each of these in the following sections.
Keeping your chain lubricated
A motorcycle chain, belt, or shaft undergoes tremendous forces as it trans-
fers power from the motor to the rear wheel. On a typical motorcycle, this
power is transferred from the front sprocket, which is attached to the motor,
to the rear sprocket, which is attached to the rear wheel, by a chain. To stay
in good shape, the chain must have lubrication between the links and must
be properly adjusted. Also note that when your chain wears out — that is, it
stretches to a point where it is too loose and can’t be used anymore — your
sprockets are worn out also. Also, be sure to get a new front and rear
sprocket when you get a new chain.
Lubing a chain is a simple process. Follow these quick and easy steps:
1. Spray the lube along the top of the sideplates of the chain.
It’s good to have a flat piece of cardboard under the chain when you do
this because chain lube is sticky, messy, and hard to clean up off your
garage floor.
2. Roll the bike forward to lube more of the chain until you have lubed
the entire chain.
You don’t need to lube the rolling pins that roll on the sprockets.
3. After the chain is lubed, wipe off the excess lube with a rag.
You’ll end up throwing this rag away because it will be a gooey mess.
Special chain lubes that are sold in motorcycle dealerships are designed to
penetrate into the pins and rollers of the chain to keep them operating
smoothly. Use a motorcycle chain lube, not motor oil or something else. Tip:
These lubes are tacky so that they cling to the chain, but because they’re
tacky, you need to take care when applying them. If you don’t wipe down a
chain thoroughly after you lube it, you’ll get chain lube all over your rear rim,
which can take a little bit of effort to remove.
186
Part III: You and Your Machine 

No matter how good the idea sounds, do not, under any circumstances, start
the bike, lift the rear wheel, and put the bike into gear in order to spin the
rear wheel and chain to lube the chain. You can get seriously hurt if your
hand or even a piece of clothing gets caught between the chain and the
sprocket. Using this technique is an easy way to lose a finger, all your fingers
on one hand, or even your whole hand.
Tightening your chain
You also need to periodically tighten your bike’s chain because it stretches
with use. To do this, follow these steps:
1. Loosen the chain adjusters on the end of the swingarm, which holds
the rear wheel axle, and loosen the axle nut; then lift the rear of the
bike using a rear-wheel stand.
If your bike has a centerstand, that would lift the rear wheel off the
ground also.
2. Adjust the locknuts on the chain adjusters until marks on the adjusters
line up with marks on the swingarm.
For example, if one side is set on the third mark from the rear, the other
side should be also.
3. Set the bike down, and then measure the chain play at the middle of
the chain, along the bottom, and between the front sprocket and the
rear sprocket.
When the chain is tightened appropriately, you should see about three-
quarters of an inch to an inch of play. Check your owner’s manual or ser-
vice manual for direction.
4. Tighten the chain adjuster locknuts and the axle nut to your bike man-
ufacturer’s torque specs as found in your owner’s or service manual.
Changing your shaft oil
If your motorcycle has a shaft drive — that is, the power is transferred from
the motor to the rear with a shaft — you’ll need to check your shaft oil level
and change it at intervals specified in your owner’s manual. For example,
your manual may tell you to check it at 8,000 miles and change it at 15,000
miles or 24,000 miles.
Changing the shaft oil is simple. Just follow these steps:
1. Ride the bike around to heat up the oil already in the bike.
This step isn’t absolutely necessary but the oil will drain out better if it
is heated up.
187
Chapter 11: Keeping Your Bike in Tiptop Shape

2. Put the bike on the centerstand, or put a block of wood under the cen-
terstand so that the bike is straight up. Then take a rag and clean
around the filler cap and the drain plug on the shaft housing at the
rear wheel.
You want the bike upright so all the oil drains out. And you want to clean
around the filler cap and drain plug so that no dirt gets into your new oil.
3. Place a container to catch the oil under the shaft housing, and then
remove the filler cap and drain plug to drain the oil.
You won’t have much oil in there so you don’t need a big catch basin. In
fact, you may only have about 4 or 5 ounces of oil involved. You can dis-
pose of this oil like you would your transmission oil — take it to be recy-
cled. It’s okay to mix the oils.
4. Inspect your drain plug gasket for any cuts.
If the drain plug gasket is damaged, replace it. It’s a good idea to replace
it anyway for peace of mind so that you don’t develop a leak.
5. Reinstall the drain plug gasket and drain plug. Torque to the manufac-
turer’s specs. Use a funnel to pour in the proper type and amount of
hypoid gear oil.
Your owner’s manual will specify the proper type — that is, the weight of
the gear oil you need — and the proper amount. You can get what you
need at a motorcycle dealership. The proper torque should also be in
your owner’s manual. If not, it’s in your service manual, if you bought one.
6. Replace the filler cap and go for a short ride. When you return home,
check for leaks.
If you have a leak it’s probably because of a bad gasket.
Maintaining the battery
Getting stranded on a motorcycle because of a dead battery isn’t much fun.
After all, you can’t just ask some guy in a car to jump your battery for you. So
a routine inspection of the battery every month will help keep you from being
stranded.
Here are the things to check when inspecting your battery:
 The electrolyte level: Make sure the electrolyte level is between the
upper and lower line markers on the side of the battery. If it’s low, bring
it up to the proper level with distilled water.
188
Part III: You and Your Machine 

 The cables and connections: Make sure these parts aren’t damaged or
corroded. Look for cuts or splits in the insulation on the wires, and
white, powdery corrosion at the connections. You can spray the connec-
tors with a special electrical cleaner available at auto parts stores to
clean them, or use a tiny piece of rolled-up fine-grain sandpaper.
 The terminals: Check these to be sure they aren’t corroded. If they are,
wipe them off with an old toothbrush or some fine-grain sandpaper.
 The casing: When inspecting your battery casing, be on the lookout for
cracks. If there’s a crack in the case, get a new battery.
 The battery vent tube: Make sure this tube isn’t kinked. You should be
able to thread the vent tube through the bike almost straight down so it
exits under the bike.
You can clean the top of the battery (or the entire battery for that matter)
with a solution of water and baking soda. You want the battery clean so that
when you take the battery filler caps off to top off the electrolyte with distilled
water you don’t get any corrosion or dirt in the battery, which would make it
lose its charge faster. If you haven’t ridden the bike in a couple of weeks, be
sure to charge the battery. Get a charger made specifically for a motorcycle
battery — that is, a 1-to-2 amp charger — and then charge the battery for 8
hours or so. You should charge the battery once a month when in storage.
Cleaning the air filter
A clean air filter is critical for the operation of your motorcycle. You need
good air flow for your motor to work properly, and you don’t want any dirt
getting past your filter into your motor, where it can do some expensive
damage. Fortunately, you don’t need to inspect the air filter very often. You
can probably inspect it every six months or every year, depending on how
dusty your riding conditions are.
Unfortunately, getting to the air filter can be a hassle on some motorcycles. In
fact, sometimes it requires removal of the gas tank. Some filters are located
under the seat and some are accessed on the side of the machine. Check your
owner’s manual for instructions on how to remove and reinstall your air filter.
After you remove your air filter, you have two options:
 Clean your filter: If you have a paper filter, you can blow compressed air
through it from the inside to clean it. If you have a foam-and-mesh filter,
you have to clean it with dish soap or another cleaning solution, let it
dry, and then oil it with air filter oil, which is available at your local
motorcycle dealer. When visiting the dealer, you can also pick up a special
cleaning solution for your air filter if you want.
189
Chapter 11: Keeping Your Bike in Tiptop Shape

 Buy a new filter: All air filters are shaped differently, so be sure you buy
one that’s made specifically for your machine. Ask your motorcycle
dealership parts department for the correct one. A new stock paper filter
will cost about $25. A wire-and-mesh air cleaner will cost double that
amount.
Which is better, paper or mesh? If you ride in really dusty conditions, it’s
better to get a mesh filter you can clean frequently. Otherwise, you can use a
stock filter and may need to only change it every three or four years.
Changing your tires
Sometimes what seems like a simple job isn’t so simple. Take changing a tire,
for example. If you prefer to change your own tires you can, but be aware
that it can be a real chore. It may also involve expensive tools. On the other
hand, changing your bike’s tires can empower you and truly connect you to
your bike and the whole experience.
Removing the wheels
Removing your bike’s wheels, which is the first step in changing your tires, is
a relatively easy task unless you have a big touring rig like a Honda Gold
Wing. This type of bike is very heavy and difficult to get off the ground. And
because of the weight, it’s difficult to keep steady off the ground.
To change your bike’s front tire, follow these steps:
1. Loosen the axle nut.
You must do this while the tire is still on the ground. If you have the tire
up in the air by lifting the front end of the bike with a stand, or even the
centerstand if your bike has one, the wheel will just spin as you try to
loosen the axle nut.
2. Loosen the bolts on the bottom of the fork leg.
You don’t need to take the bolts out, but you do need to loosen them so
that they almost come out.
3. Lift the front end of the bike up.
It’s best to use a front-end stand to lift the front end of the bike off the
floor so that you have enough room to drop the wheel down, allowing
the brake discs to come out of the brake calipers. Make sure the bike is
held up securely by the stand. It should be stable, not wobbly.
4. Take the axle nut off, hold onto the wheel, and pull the axle out from
the fork legs and the wheel.
190
Part III: You and Your Machine 

It’s best to hold the wheel rim at the top instead of putting your hand
under the wheel because if you aren’t strong enough to hold the wheel
up with one arm you’ll smash your hand when the wheel hits the floor.
When you’re ready, you can install the front wheel by reversing the proce-
dure. It’s a good idea to wipe the old grease off the axle and then apply a coat
of high-temperature grease before reinstalling the axle to keep your wheel
turning smoothly. Also, you may need to pry apart the brake pads in the
calipers with a big flathead screwdriver to make room for the brake discs to
slide in. Finally, pump the brake lever a few times to make sure you have the
proper pressure in the brake lines.
Removing the rear wheel of a bike is much like removing the front, with a
couple additional steps:
1. Take the cotter pin out of the axle that keeps the axle nut from turn-
ing and then loosen the axle nut.
You don’t necessarily have to do this before lifting the rear of the bike
off the ground, but you may as well do so to keep your technique for
changing the front and rear wheels as similar as possible.
2. Loosen the chain adjusters on the swingarm.
To do this, just loosen the bolts on the chain adjusters.
3. Lift the rear of the bike up using a rear-end stand or a jack.
Make sure the rear end is held up firmly. The bike should be stable.
4. Hold the rear wheel firmly and pull the axle out.
The rear wheel is big and heavy, so be sure you have a firm grip on the
wheel.
5. Push the rear wheel toward the front of the bike so that you have a lot
of slack in the chain. Pull the chain off the rear sprocket and move it
to the side.
You may be able to hang the chain on the end of the swingarm.
6. Drop the rear wheel out of the swingarm.
When you’re ready, you can install the rear wheel by reversing the procedure.
Be sure to put new grease on the axle. And remember that you may need to
pry apart the brake pads in the caliper to accommodate the brake disc. Be
sure to pump the rear brake lever a few times to make sure you have pres-
sure in the brake.
Taking the old tires off and putting on new ones
You can try to get your tires off the rims with tire irons, but that’s tough with
big tires with short sidewalls. You also can buy a tire-changing rig, but they’re
expensive (hundreds of dollars) and would take up a lot of room in your
191
Chapter 11: Keeping Your Bike in Tiptop Shape

garage. And, really, you probably won’t be changing your tires that often to
warrant the purchase. But if you do want to change your own tires, you’ll
need a bead breaker that costs about $75, a pair of tire irons that would run
you about $30 each, a wheel balancer for about $200, a valve core tool (for
removing the valve core) for $4, a wheel crate for $10, and wheel weights for
about $15. You also need a spray bottle with a solution of warm water and
some dishwashing liquid.
If you don’t have a front-end or rear-wheel stand, it really isn’t a good idea to
improvise a way to lift your bike up when removing a tire. Sure, you could try
using a car jack, but think of the damage to the bike if it slips off the jack,
especially after you have the front or rear wheel off. Instead, take the bike to
a dealership to have the tire changed.
After you have your wheel off the bike, follow these steps to change the tire:
1. Using your valve core tool, take out the valve core where you fill the
tire with air.
This step will allow all the air to get out of the tire.
2. Place the wheel sideways on your wheel crate.
Make sure the brake disc isn’t touching the crate because discs bend
easily and you’ll be putting pressure on the wheel in the next step.
3. Use your bead breaker to push the bead of the tire down away from
the rim.
You need to move in small steps all the way around the tire to break the
entire bead from the rim. Be careful that you don’t mar your rim with the
bead breaker during this process.
4. Flip the wheel over and break the bead on the other side.
5. Take your spray bottle with the mixture of water and dishwashing
liquid and spray the rim where you just broke the bead as well as the
tire bead.
Spraying in this way will make it a lot easier to get the tire off the rim.
Don’t use a spray lubricant or any other liquid that won’t dry away.
6. Wedge a tire iron between the tire and the rim, and then lift the tire
bead. Use a second tire iron to lever the bead up over the rim on 
the left and right sides of your first tire iron. Continue around the
entire rim.
You can use rim protectors to protect your rim from tire iron damage
when you lever the bead of the tire up over the rim. Or you could use a
little strip of duct tape.
7. Repeat to get the second bead off the rim.
192
Part III: You and Your Machine 

8. Install a new tire by reversing the process.
After the tire is on the rim, reinstall the valve stem core and inflate the
tire. The tire will make a loud pop sound as each bead seats. If it doesn’t,
deflate the tire and try again.
9. Balance the new wheel.
To balance a wheel, put the wheel on your tire balancer and put a bit of
weight on the rim on the opposite side of the valve stem. Then give the
wheel a little spin. Let the wheel stop, and then spin it again.
If the weight is too heavy, it will be at the bottom when the tire stops
spinning. If that’s the case, add less weight. If the weight is too light, the
heaviest part of the wheel will always wind up at the bottom. The key is
to get the right amount of weight on the wheel so that you can move the
tire one-quarter turn and stop it in place four times and the wheel will
stay in place each time.
Hiring a Pro to Do the Work
If you can do some of the minor motorcycle maintenance work yourself (see
the section, “Saving Some Bucks by Maintaining Your Own Bike,” earlier in
this chapter), you can save some money. However, you really need a
mechanic for some of the more difficult tasks. For example, if you have a big
cruiser or touring bike and you can’t find a front-end or rear-end stand that
will work for changing the tires, you’ll likely want a mechanic to do the entire
tire-changing job.
Another area where you’ll probably want to pay a dealer to do the work is
when dealing with suspension components. Replacing the fork oil can be a
tough job even with the proper tools, so it’s best left to the pros. And while
you’re having the front fork oil changed, you may as well have your rear
shocks rebuilt (if they’re actually rebuildable).
In fact, you may decide right off the bat that you aren’t mechanically inclined
and want to have a shop do all the work, even the routine maintenance. And
that’s okay. If you’re considering hiring a professional mechanic to work on
your bike, this section can help. Here you can find info on the pros and cons
of using a professional and how you can find a good mechanic.
The pros and cons of using a professional
Just like most decisions in life, if you want to take your bike to a mechanic,
you need to weigh the pros and the cons before you make a decision. After
all, having the work done in a shop has its clear advantages and disadvantages.
193
Chapter 11: Keeping Your Bike in Tiptop Shape

The following are some of the pros of having a mechanic work on your
machine:
 You know that the work will be done right. Professional mechanics
typically are skilled and can handle all types of work, particularly the
more difficult motor work. (Note: If your bike needs motor work, I highly
recommend that you use a mechanic. Why chance blowing up your
motor to save a few bucks?)
 You have a guarantee. A dealership or repair shop will guarantee its
work, usually for 30 days.
 You have all the service receipts, which is important if you ever
decide to sell the bike. A bike is easier to sell when you can prove to
prospective buyers that it was well maintained.
Unfortunately, using a mechanic has some downsides as well. Here they are:
 You’re at the mercy of the dealer concerning when he can get the
work done. For instance, you may take your bike into a shop and not get
it back for a week or two (or even more).
 You have to arrange transportation back from the shop while you
leave your bike, and then back to the shop to pick up the bike when
the work is finished. You can avoid this if you haul the bike to and from
the shop in a truck or trailer.
 You’re paying for labor costs that you wouldn’t pay if you did the
work yourself. With labor costs running $60 to $75 per hour or more,
you can save $120 or more in labor cost by doing a 2-hour job yourself.
That’s why it’s cheaper to take just the wheels in to get your tires
changed than to take the whole bike in.
Finding a good shop
If you decide that you need to use a mechanic, make sure that you use a rep-
utable one who will take care of your bike and not take advantage of you. So
how do you decide which mechanic is best? I suggest you first ask your fellow
riders; they can easily tell you who they take their bikes to.
Ask them what kind of work they’ve had done on their bikes, how much it
cost, whether they thought the work was done right and the cost was reason-
able, and how long it took to get the work done. Ask if they believe there’s a
certain mechanic you should ask for by name.
After you have a couple of referrals from friends or fellow riders, make sure
you do the following as you make a decision:
194
Part III: You and Your Machine 

 Visit various dealerships. First, take note of how the staff treats you.
Obviously they should be polite, friendly, and easy to deal with, but
don’t forget that the service people should be very knowledgeable. Try
to get a sense of how well the service manager knows your model of
motorcycle by chatting about your problem and asking what the prob-
lem may be. By now you know a little bit about your machine so you
may be able to tell by what the service manager says whether he or she
knows about your bike. For example, if you have a fuel-injected machine
and the service manager talks about the carbs, that’s a red flag.
Also take a look at the service area. See if it looks neat, and then try to
get an idea of whether the workers look like they know what they’re
doing. Do they look methodical, with few wasted movements? Or are
they stopping a lot to talk, contemplating, and spending time walking
across the shop to get various tools? Time is money — yours.
 Remember that you aren’t limited to dealerships that sell the major
brands of motorcycles. A lot of little repair shops out there (that don’t
sell motorcycles) are just as good, or even better. In fact, if you have an
older bike, you may have no choice but to patronize a repair shop. Why?
Because a lot of dealerships won’t even work on bikes that are 10 years
old or older.
 If you’re a sportbike rider, you may want to seek out a specialty shop
that works only on sportbikes. These specialty shops know the
machines well and can handle the performance enhancements you want.
Many times local racers run sportbike repair/performance shops. Ask
around at the local racetrack on race day; the racers can steer you to
the right people.
 Sometimes you don’t get any clear advice from your riding buddies
and you just have to take a chance on a shop. For instance, you may
have to go to the closest shop to your house or one you pick out of the
telephone book based on its ad. That’s fine, too. Based on your first
experience with that shop you’ll decide whether to go back again, and
whether to recommend the shop to friends.
After you find a dealership or shop you like, stick with it even if prices may
be cheaper at another place. It’s worth it to pay more to patronize a shop
where you’re comfortable with the work and the people.
Handling Special Maintenance 
in the Winter and Spring
Hard-core motorcyclists ride year-round, even if they live in the Snowbelt. In
Michigan, for example, there’s an organized ride that begins each year at mid-
night on January 1. Now that’s dedication to the sport! However, not all
195
Chapter 11: Keeping Your Bike in Tiptop Shape

motorcyclists like winter riding. And in fact, riding in the winter’s icy and
snowy conditions may not be the smartest choice for a beginning rider. So in
late fall, when temperatures start to take a dive, many motorcyclists tuck
their bikes away for the winter. And then, after what seems like forever, they
get to pull their bikes out in the spring to begin another riding season.
You can’t just park your bike in the winter and then start it up in the spring
and expect it to go. Unless you want to deal with some time-consuming and
possibly expensive problems in the spring when you try to start your bike,
you need to properly prepare it for winter storage.
This section discusses those maintenance steps you need to take to prepare
your bike for the winter hibernation and for the riding season in the spring.
Preparing your bike for winter storage
Carefully preparing your motorcycle for winter storage will save you a lot of
headaches and expense when spring comes and you want to ride. If you don’t
take the proper steps, spring will find your carburetors all gummed up and
not working and your battery dead.
It’s best to store your bike in a garage away from the elements. If you don’t
have a garage or a buddy who will let you store your bike at his or her place,
some dealerships will store your bike in the winter for a monthly fee. You can
also use a self-storage business if the company allows vehicles to be stored in
the storage units. Some don’t. Finally, you can keep the bike outside with a
motorcycle cover over it.
To properly store your bike for the winter, you need to follow these steps:
1. Fill the gas tank with gas, and then add a fuel stabilizer.
This step will keep the gas from going bad and creating a varnish in your
carburetors that’s time-consuming to clean out. You can get fuel stabi-
lizer at any auto parts store. Filling the tank will keep condensation from
getting water in the gas.
2. Start the bike and run it for three minutes to get the old gas out of the
carburetor and the new gas with the stabilizer into it.
This will ensure that the small orifices in the carburetor won’t have the
old gas in them that would harden, blocking the passageways and
requiring cleaning in the spring.
196
Part III: You and Your Machine 

3. Remove your battery so your bike doesn’t drain it.
Charge the battery overnight every month. It really doesn’t matter
where you store the battery. Just be sure it isn’t near fire or something
very hot, since it could explode. And don’t put it where kids can get to it
and possibly get burned by the battery acid.
4. Change the oil and filter.
This ensures that everything is fresh for the winter and contaminants
don’t cause any problems.
5. Check your radiator coolant to make sure you have enough to with-
stand the cold winter temperatures.
The radiator fluid level should be between the two lines on your plastic
fill tank, just like in your car.
6. Put the required amount of air in the tires.
You can figure out how much air to put in your tires by looking to your
owner’s or service manual. You don’t want your tires to be low on air
because they can develop a flat spot from sitting in one place for several
months.
7. Clean the bike thoroughly and wax it.
This keeps dirt and other grime from possibly permanently etching itself
into your bike. Plus, when spring comes you won’t have to give your
bike a thorough cleaning.
8. Wipe or spray your cables, engine cases, exhaust system, and body-
work with protective lubricants.
This cleaning will keep the plastic parts from cracking and will keep any
dust or other grime that may get on the bike while it’s stored from
making your bike a permanent home.
Be sure to use the proper spray for the surface you want to protect.
Some sprays aren’t good for plastic, for example. You can get special
lubricants at motorcycle shops to clean the windscreen. Other lubri-
cants may damage it. Read the labels on the products for what the prod-
uct is made for, and what it cautions against.
9. Cover your bike with a bike cover.
If you don’t have a bike cover, use an old blanket or a sheet. This just
helps keep the bike clean and keeps dust and possible grime from get-
ting into hard-to-clean places.
10. Go into the garage every week or so during the winter, uncover the
bike, and just look at it.
This step will be the one to help you get through the winter.
197
Chapter 11: Keeping Your Bike in Tiptop Shape

Getting your bike ready for spring riding
If you prepped your bike properly for winter storage, there isn’t a whole lot
you need to do to ride in the spring. The most important things you need to
do are change the oil again and install the fully charged battery. Then you’re
all set to go for a ride.
If you didn’t prep your bike properly for winter, you need to do the following:
 Drain the gas tank and put in new gas.
 Have the carburetors cleaned (they probably have varnish in them and
are clogged up).
 Change the oil and filter.
 Buy and install a new battery.
 Check the tires to be sure they have enough air.
After taking care of these tasks, you, too, are ready to ride.

Customizing: How to Make 
Your Bike Your Own
In This Chapter
 Discovering the most common cosmetic improvements
 Making your machine perform better
 Finding parts and good deals on the Internet
W
e motorcyclists like to think that motorcycling is all about individual-
ity. Okay, maybe a lot of us wear the same black leather jackets, the
same chaps, and the same black boots. But we are all individuals, and a lot 
of us like to reflect that individuality in the machines we ride. Something as
simple as a well-placed sticker can set one bike apart from another and
reflect the personality of the rider.
Most riders aren’t satisfied with just slapping a sticker on the bike’s bodywork,
however. In this chapter, you discover some of the changes that you can
apply to your machine to make it your own. These changes include cosmetic
ones to make your bike look just the way you want it to look, or performance
improvements to allow it to handle well and stop and go better. Making these
improvements can be expensive, so I show you where to get deals and check
out the real cost of making changes.
Cosmetic Improvements 
for the Look You Want
You can make a lot of changes to your bike to personalize it without spending
gobs of money. New turn signals, mirrors, handgrips, a smoke windscreen,
footpegs, custom gas caps, and a custom seat are just some of the items you
may try.

Other changes, which start to get pricey, include various carbon-fiber parts
for sportbikes (such as fenders) or various chrome parts for cruisers.
However, be aware that a lot of chrome can make your bike heavy and can
slow down the handling.
You can also find fender-eliminator kits that eliminate your stock rear fender
and give the rear of your sportbike a sleek, roadracer look. In fact, if you want
to go all out, you can get a paint job and have stickers made to make your
machine look just like your favorite roadracer’s bike.
Whether you have a new or used bike, you may want to paint and customize
it to reflect your personal style. That’s great, because it’s all a part of motor-
cycling. But remember that no matter how much you like the paint job or all
those great chrome accessories, most prospective buyers won’t share your
aesthetic taste when it comes time to sell. In fact, they’ll probably want to
customize the bike themselves. So if you do customize your machine, keep all
the stock parts. Then, when it’s time to sell, bolt the stock stuff back on to sell
the bike, and sell the accessories separately. You’ll get more money that way.
New paint
A full paint job can cost between $1,000 and $5,000 or more, depending on
how many body panels are involved and how complicated the pattern is. 
If you aren’t prepared to shell out that kind of cash, just get the gas tank
painted — maybe you want a skull, a rose, or some other item on the top 
of the tank. This touch is a lot cheaper, and you can repaint the tank to the
stock colors when it comes time to sell.
Shop around for painters, because you’ll find differences in prices. Be sure to
check out examples of their work. And remember that the more famous the
painter is, the more expensive his or her work will be. Of course, you can get
a lesser-known painter to do just as good a job. Consider, too, seeking out
someone who’s experienced in painting bikes instead of choosing someone
who primarily paints cars.
New pipes, wheels, and saddlebags
Usually the first thing riders do to their bikes is change the exhaust pipe.
They have different reasons for doing so — they want a deeper, throatier
sound, or they just don’t like the look of the stock exhaust. Of course, they
may have another motivation: They may have smashed it in a crash.
Whatever your reason, be sure the new pipe meets federal sound require-
ments. Why? Because more towns are cracking down on loud pipes. And 
loud pipes aren’t worth getting a ticket over or being the cause of a bike 
ban in town.
200
Part III: You and Your Machine 

To get around federal sound limits for exhaust systems, pipe makers stamp
on their pipes phrases like “For off-road use only” or “For competition use
only.” Doing so is quite funny, really, because a lot of those pipes are made for
cruisers that would never go on a racetrack or off road.
The motorcycling climate is changing, however. Loud pipes increasingly are
being seen as uncool and as a risk to all motorcyclists’ freedom to ride where
they want, when they want. So, don’t buy a pipe that says “For off-road use
only” or “For competition use only,” because you may not be able to ride
your bike in some towns — and if your city or state requires safety inspec-
tions, you probably won’t pass. (I go into more depth on the sound issue in
Chapter 2.)
Keep in mind that a loud pipe isn’t necessarily a more powerful pipe. In fact,
you could experience a loss of power and reduced throttle response by get-
ting a louder pipe. After all, your stock pipe was made specifically for your
motorcycle. In the aftermarket world, compromises sometimes must be made
to ensure that pipes fit a lot of different bikes.
You can also get custom wheels to give your bike a really sharp look. Most of
the time, these wheels are lighter than stock, which improves handling. But
be forewarned that custom wheels can cost $750 to $1,500 each.
Hard saddlebags that look like they came stock with the bike are a nice option,
but they can set you back $500 or more. You can get leather bags for much
less.
Performance Improvements 
for Your Machine
If you want to make major changes to your bike, spend the big money on per-
formance improvements. After all, you bought the bike to ride. Well, okay, you
also probably spend a lot of time in your garage just looking at your bike. Yes,
that’s another thing that separates car people from bike people. How many
car people do you know who can spend hours in their garage just staring at
their car? Not many. Bike people do it all the time.
Most performance improvements will make you a better rider because they
also make the bike easier to ride. So while your riding buddies are spending
thousands of dollars on paint, chrome, and accessories, you’ll be spending
less on your performance improvements — and you’ll be smoking them on
the road.
You don’t need to do a whole lot to your bike to make it perform better. In
fact, if you have a new bike, you need to do very little — at least, right away.
Modern bikes, especially sportbikes, are good straight from the factory. If
201
Chapter 12: Customizing: How to Make Your Bike Your Own

you’d like, you can make some upgrades to cruisers almost immediately, such
as improved brakes or motor work.
In this section, I cover the various types of improvements that you can con-
sider to make your machine your own or to make it perform better.
Suspension: Improving the ride
There’s no question about it: The best place to put money is in your suspen-
sion. If you improve the suspension in the front forks and the rear shock(s),
you’ll be amazed at how much better the bike handles. The performance
improvement makes sense because bikes from the factory come with the 
suspension components set up for a mythical rider who probably weighs 160
pounds or so. If you weigh more or less, the suspension isn’t tuned for you.
Some outfits can revalve your front forks and install springs to set up the sus-
pension for your weight and riding style. You need to talk to the mechanic in
person, on the phone, or on the Internet so he or she can get all the details
needed from you to correctly set up your forks. Of course, you’ll also have to
give them your forks. You can buy the components to do the job yourself, but
you have to be a pretty skilled mechanic and you may need special tools to
do it.
A new rear shock or shocks will greatly improve your ride as well. Even better
is the fact that aftermarket shocks have a lot of adjustments, which means
that you can fine-tune them. Again, contact the shock maker to be sure the
company has all the details it needs to set up the shock correctly for you and
your riding style. When you get your shock, don’t fiddle with it. Even experi-
enced motorcyclists can become befuddled with all the adjustments that are
available on a good aftermarket shock. Learn all you can about adjusting the
shock before you even attempt it, and take copious notes every step of the
way so you can put it back the way it was, if you need to.
Brakes: More stopping power
You always need to stop on a bike. And sometimes you need to stop fast. Are
your brakes up to it? If not, you can make some changes to keep yourself out
of trouble when it’s time to hit the binders hard. Brake upgrades range from
simply changing the brake pads to replacing all the brake components. All
you have to decide is how much stopping power you want — and how much
money you’re willing to spend.
202
Part III: You and Your Machine 

Besides the pads, you can change the discs by increasing the diameter to give
the pads more area to grip. Sportbikes with massive brakes have 330 mm
discs. That’s about 13 inches. For a great combination, add braided-steel
brake lines if you have rubber ones on your bike, and upgrade your brake
calipers. You can get four- or six-piston calipers, but four should be plenty.
A lot of motorcyclists keep their stock brake systems but immediately replace
the rubber brake hoses on their bikes with steel-braided lines. This upgrade
does away with any mushiness the motorcyclist may feel when the rubber
hoses flex under pressure. The steel-braided lines don’t flex and provide a firm
feel. You can also replace your brake master cylinder and front brake lever.
If you’re going to go all out — that is, you want to change your brake lines,
calipers, rotors, master cylinder, and brake lever — it’s cheaper to buy a
complete brake system made for your bike. Plus, then you know you’ll be 
getting exactly what you need. Price? Try $1,500 to $2,500.
The seat: Riding in comfort
Most stock seats are great, but they aren’t all great for everybody. If your seat
isn’t quite as plush as you’d like, don’t worry. Aftermarket manufacturers feel
your pain and have come up with some nifty, more comfy seats that bolt right
on. A new seat won’t improve the performance of your bike, of course, but it
will dramatically improve your riding experience.
A wide variety of seats are available, especially for cruisers. You can get single
seats, or seats made for the rider and a passenger, or seats with colored piping
or other designs to fit your bike. So a long-distance ride doesn’t have to be a
pain in the seat. Expect to pay around $250 or more.
Cheaper alternatives do exist. For example, companies make gel pads that
attach to your seat to soften the ride, and you can also buy sheepskin covers
and other add-ons. So if you can’t afford to buy an aftermarket seat, explore
some of the other alternatives.
Tires: Choosing between 
stickier or longer lasting
At some point, you’ll need to change your tires. Then you’ll have some choices
to make. Do you want a long-lasting tire or one that really sticks to the road
when you lean way over? You can’t have both. To be long lasting, a tire needs
hard rubber. But a tire with a lot of grip is a soft tire.
203
Chapter 12: Customizing: How to Make Your Bike Your Own

You also have to make sure that you get the right-sized tires for your bike. The
best thing to do is to get tires that are the same make and size as the ones that
are already on the bike. But if your bike came with long-lasting tires and you
want something sticky, you have to know what tires will fit. Fortunately, the
tire manufacturers have fitment guides on their Web sites to show which of
their tires fit which bikes.
Tires have important information on the sidewall that you need to know how
to decipher. This information is a combination of letters and numbers. For
example, a tire may have this on its sidewall: 130/90 WR 17. Here’s what that
means:
 130: The tire is 130 mm wide, or 5 to 5.10 inches.
 90: This number is the aspect ratio of the tire, which is the ratio between
the height of the tire and the width. In this case, the tire is 117 mm tall,
or 90 percent as tall as it is wide.
 W: This letter is the speed rating, or the maximum speed a tire can
handle for a sustained amount of time under its recommended load
capacity. W is 168 mph. The ratings range from Q, which is 99 mph, to 
Y, which is 186 mph.
 R: This letter means that the tire is a radial tire, or has a radial construc-
tion. A B means the tire is a belted bias tire.
 17: This number is the size of the rim, which is 17 inches in this case.
You’ll also notice on a tire the maximum air pressure, which could be, say, 45
pounds per square inch (psi). Don’t fill the tire to that maximum unless you’ll
be carrying a lot of stuff. The manufacturer’s recommended pressure is usu-
ally more like 32–36 psi. If the tires came on the bike new, you can get the rec-
ommended pressure from your owner’s manual. If the tires aren’t stock, you
can get the recommended pressure from the tire manufacturer’s Web site. The
tire also notes the maximum load the tire can handle, such as 500 pounds.
Would you like to know when the tire was made? Well, you’re in luck because
that information is on the sidewall as well! This information is useful because
you don’t want to buy tires that are four years old. You’ll find on a raised area
four numbers, something like 1008. That means the tire was made in the 10th
week, or March, of 2008.
Finally, you’ll see a directional arrow that shows which way the tire should
rotate when it’s mounted. When mounting tires, or having them mounted, be
sure that these arrows are pointed the correct way. Tires are designed to
work in the rain or in wet conditions if they’re mounted the correctly.

Motor work: How fast do you want to go?
When most people think about improving motorcycle performance, they 
usually think about beefing up the motor. However, the fact is that most
people can go faster by learning how to ride better and smoother. (I cover
performance-riding schools in Chapter 3.) Besides learning to ride better, if
you want to go faster, you can improve your suspension. After you do that
stuff, then you can consider building a more powerful motor.
Here’s the problem: To make a lot more power, you need to spend a lot more
money. After all, building a better motor involves more than just putting on
new cylinders and throwing in bigger pistons (although that’s a fairly easy
upgrade if you want make your Harley-Davidson 883 a 1200cc machine).
Consider this: To make big power, you probably need hotter camshafts, bigger
pistons, a high-compression head, bored-out or different (meaning bigger)
cylinders, bigger carburetors, a new exhaust system, probably stronger con-
necting rods, and more. So to boost your horsepower by 25 percent or so,
you could end up spending $5,000. Is it really worth it? Only you can decide.
Let’s say you want a smaller power boost, perhaps 10 percent. Depending on
your machine, that boost could cost $1,000 to $2,000. Again, is it worth it?
Besides the cost, your motor will be less reliable.
If you decide on motor work, you have to pay for all the parts at once and
have them installed at one time. What you want done to your bike may be 
so common, such as bigger pistons and high-performance camshafts, that
there’s a kit available for purchase.
You need to find a reputable motor-building shop to do the work so that your
motor doesn’t explode shortly after you get it built. If you’re serious about
getting a motor built, go to your local roadrace track and ask around. The
racers know who the good engine builders are. Or ask the motorcycle com-
petitors at the local dragstrip. In fact, the dragstrip would also be the place 
to go to ask about good motor builders for cruisers.
Finding Deals on the Parts You Need
You’re all set to create your masterpiece of a motorcycle with aftermarket
parts and accessories. From researching what you want at the dealerships, in
motorcycle magazines, and on the Internet, you have a pretty good idea of
what the retail prices are. So you do some quick math in your head, add up
the price of all the parts, and suddenly your dream machine is going to cost
you a lot more than you thought.
205
Chapter 12: Customizing: How to Make Your Bike Your Own

Hey, no one said that motorcycling was cheap. But, luckily, there are ways to
cut your costs and get the look and performance you want without having 
to take out a second mortgage. The key, like in buying anything else, is to
shop around and look for deals.
These days, the Internet makes finding deals a lot easier because you aren’t
stuck just looking exclusively in stores in your area. And parts manufacturers
and others often have Internet-only specials on their Web sites. These items
are sold at a sale price online only. Dealers also often unload old stock this
way. Deals are out there. You just need to find them.
Getting deals on the Internet
Customizing your bike can be expensive — very expensive. So, when you can,
buy your parts from a local dealer. You should shop this way for two reasons:
 You’ll be supporting your local bike shop and its support of the sport.
 If you have a problem with the accessory, you can take it back.
But sometimes the dealer can’t get what you want, or it’s just too expensive.
That’s when you need to shop around on the Internet.
Just about anything imaginable is available for your bike if you look hard
enough for it. And the Internet has made shopping very easy. Not only can
you check out the Web sites of the manufacturers of the parts you’re looking
for, but you can also go to big mail-order houses. You can even find used
parts that may suit your needs.
The problem with buying on the Internet, though, is that it can be a hassle to
return a part if it doesn’t fit. Or, if you aren’t careful, you can get ripped off.
Scams are more likely to happen if you’re dealing with a person across the
country than if you’re dealing with a reputable store.
So, after you’ve decided on all the great stuff you want to buy and you’ve
picked up what you can from your local dealer, it’s time to sit down at your
computer and use your favorite search engine to find what you need. Suppose
you’re looking for some nifty leather saddlebags so you can carry your stuff.
Just type into your search engine “motorcycle saddlebags,” and you’ll find 
zillions for sale. The process is like magic, really.
Now you can simply read the descriptions of the products to find exactly what
you want and look for the best price. You have a wide variety of sources to
buy from, including leather stores, motorcycle dealerships, and big mail-order
houses. When you go to these various Web sites, look for a button to click
206
Part III: You and Your Machine 

that says something like Closeouts, Specials, Internet Specials, or Blowouts.
Always look there first for the item you’re looking for. This section is where
the deals are.
eBay: Deals are there, too
eBay, the great online auction site, used to be a great place to get very good
deals on used motorcycle parts sold by people around the country. Granted,
you had no way to tell whether the parts you were buying were stolen, but
that was a chance you took. (Some people won’t buy parts off eBay because
they don’t want to support the theft of parts in any way.) And you also faced
the chance of getting ripped off; however if you used PayPal, you could get
some protection.
You can still find some great deals on eBay, but it seems to have a lot fewer
private sellers than it did in the past and a lot more stores. Stores have dis-
covered eBay as a way to reach consumers nationwide, and they don’t really
offer good deals on a lot of the products. But big mail-order houses also use
eBay as a way to sell off their overstocked items, so you can get some really
good buys this way. Some individuals also sell used items on eBay.
Sometimes to find good deals you need to be creative, though. For example, if
you’re looking for motorcycle saddlebags, try typing in what you are looking
for in various ways: saddlebags, motorcycle saddlebags, motorcycle saddle
bags, even saddle bags. Sometimes sellers misspell what they’re selling and
don’t catch the mistake.
Making sure the part is worth the price
Be a savvy shopper. Check out the prices of what you’re looking for at dealer-
ships in your area, and use the Internet to compare prices. Don’t buy the first
set of saddlebags you come across when searching on a search engine; you’re
sure to find the same thing cheaper elsewhere. You may have to take a little
time, but it could save you a bunch of money.
You probably won’t find deals on some items, though. For instance, aftermar-
ket wheels are always full price. You may be able to find used wheels from
private dealers or salvage yards, but you’re taking a chance that the wheels
have flaws, such as cracks, that could cause them to explode while you’re
riding down the road.
Ultimately, though, a part is worth what you’re willing to spend for it. If you
really, really want it, and it will make your bike look great, then go for it.
Spend the cash.
207
Chapter 12: Customizing: How to Make Your Bike Your Own

Deciding whether a combination 
of parts is worth it
The great thing about customizing your motorcycle is that you don’t have to
do all the improvements at once. You just add bits as your budget allows. For
example, at first you can add relatively inexpensive items, such as saddle-
bags, new hand grips, new levers, and new mirrors. Then you can make 
suspension upgrades and put money into the brakes. You can do this over
several years.
But if you want it all, and you want it now, it may be a good idea to figure out
your total cost and see if it may be cheaper to just have a custom machine
built for you. That way, you get the paint job, the motor, the suspension, and
all the accessories you really want. The downside? You need the money up
front, and that could be $25,000 to $50,000 or more.
Keep in mind that aftermarket accessories and custom paint jobs can be diffi-
cult to insure. Some companies will insure them, however, so make sure you
and your agent agree on the value before you need to file a claim. I discuss
insuring accessories in Chapter 10.
If you don’t have a lot of money to spend right now, you’ll have to add on bits
here and there and do performance work over the years. Only you can decide
whether the improvements are worth the cost. Remember, at resale time, you
won’t get back nearly the amount of money you sink into the machine. In fact,
you may actually lower the value of your bike. But you’ll sure have fun riding
it before you decide to sell it — if you ever decide to sell it.

N
ow you’re ready to ride . . . or are you? Good motor-
cyclists don’t just hop on their bikes and go. They
follow certain rituals to be sure they’re mentally and phys-
ically ready to ride and that their bikes are in good shape.
In this part, I cover some of the mental and mechanical
preparation you should go through any time you ride.
I also show you how to handle a flat tire on the street, a
stuck throttle, and the best ways to cross railroad tracks
safely. In addition to other beginner tips, I introduce some
advanced riding techniques that help you be the best
rider possible.
After you’re a bike pro, you’re ready to figure out where
you want to go. Your adventure is only limited by your
imagination. So in this part, I give you tips on how to plan
a spectacular trip, whether it’s for two days or two weeks.
I also reveal what you need to take on your trip to be pre-
pared for just about anything.

M
otorcycling is an active sport that requires a rider to make a lot of
split-second decisions and give the machine precise inputs to ensure
that it does what the rider wants it to do. Liken riding a motorcycle to flying a
jet fighter: You need clear thinking, precise control, and complete confidence
in your machine and your safety equipment to do whatever you need it to do.
Just as a jet fighter pilot wouldn’t fly with a hangover, while sick, or with a
lack of confidence in his or her equipment, neither should a motorcyclist.
Unfortunately, many do. Pilots go through a preflight ritual to make sure that
everything is up to snuff before they climb into the cockpit and take off. A
motorcyclist should also.
In this chapter, you explore what it takes to prepare for a motorcycle ride,
whether you’re a rider or a passenger, and whether you plan to go across the
block or across the country. Here you’ll discover what you need to think
about mentally and physically to prepare for the ride, what to examine before
you put on your jacket and other safety gear, and what to look at when doing
a safety check of your motorcycle. If you do this a few times, you’ll develop
your own preride ritual that will help you stay safe on the road.
Judging Your Mind and Body
Riding a motorcycle is great fun, but it’s also serious business. Think about a
motorcycle. You have only two tires, and those two tires have only a small
area touching the road. A motorcycle can easily fall over if you aren’t careful.

And you have to be careful every time you ride, especially if you’re a new
rider. Your mind has to process a lot of different information constantly, and
you have to decide how to manipulate the controls of your machine based on
that information. A clear mind is required to be able to do that — and do it
quickly, when necessary.
For example, that small part of the tire that comes into contact with the road
is called the contact patch. You need to be able to accurately judge how much
traction that contact patch has every second you’re on a motorcycle. A fuzzy
head could cloud your feel for the traction, which could lead to a crash.
You have to be physically prepared to ride as well. After all, riding a motorcy-
cle takes a lot of body movement. So before you ride, evaluate both your
mind and your body.
Getting mentally prepared for a ride
You don’t need a crystal-clear head every time you ride, but if you aren’t
crystal clear, be sure to ride accordingly by slowing down and being extra
careful. Here’s what you should do to get ready mentally for a ride:
 Get a good night’s sleep the night before. You don’t want to hit the hay
at 1 a.m. and then get up at 4 a.m. for a long day of riding. Being groggy
can be dangerous.
 Don’t ride drunk or under the influence of drugs. ‘Nuff said.
 If you’re angry, it’s a good idea to calm down and relax before you go
for a ride. Being angry may make you twist the throttle a little harder
than you should, or go a little faster, or take chances you otherwise
wouldn’t.
 If you’re worried about something, be honest with yourself before you
get on your bike. For instance, be honest about whether a ride would
clear your head and make you forget about your worries, or whether
you would spend so much time worrying that you wouldn’t concentrate
on your riding. Riding takes a lot of concentration, so you can’t be think-
ing about something else and riding at the same time.
 Be excited about the ride. If you feel that the ride may be a chore, take
your car.
 Use your best judgment. If you feel like you shouldn’t ride your motor-
cycle, even if you can’t explain why, don’t.
212
Part IV: Let’s Ride! 

Making sure your body 
is saying “Let’s go!”
Much of motorcycling is mental, but you can’t ignore the physical aspects of
the sport. A lot of movement is involved. You’re shifting with your left foot,
braking with your right foot, manipulating the clutch with your left hand,
using the front brake with your right hand, and shifting your body on the seat
of the bike. Plus, you’re turning the handlebars, raising and lowering your
upper body, and even standing up on the footpegs sometimes. Unlike when
driving a car, a lot of physical activity is involved when riding a motorcycle.
When you know you’re mentally prepared for a ride, you need to determine
whether you’re physically prepared. Ask yourself these questions:
 Am I feeling too sick to ride? If you’re really sick, don’t ride. If you’re
only a little sick, judge whether your balance is affected. Being able to
balance your motorcycle and keep your balance in sharp turns is critical
for a safe ride. If your ears are plugged or you have trouble hearing, don’t
ride: Your balance may be affected, and you need to be able to hear what’s
going on while you’re on the road.
 Am I fully hydrated? If you’re dehydrated and head out on a long ride in
the hot sun, you can get very sick very fast, and you may not even be
able to make the ride home.
 How’s my eyesight? When is the last time you had your eyes examined
or your glasses prescription changed? You need good eyesight to ride
because you’ll be looking for dangers far down the road. If you’re an
older rider, a check-up is even more important.
 How’s my night vision? Some people have a lot of troubling driving a
car at night, let alone riding a motorcycle at night. If you have bad night
vision, don’t chance riding at night.
 Do I have aches and pains or stiffness in my muscles? Minor aches and
pains or stiffness are no problem. But if it hurts to move your back, to
pull in the clutch or brake lever, or to move your foot to shift, you may
want to put off riding until later.
 Am I dressed for the weather? Are you wearing the proper gear if it’s
hot, cold, or raining? If it’s hot outside, will your trip be so long that
you’ll be riding at night when it can get cold? If so, you need to bring
some cold-riding gear. (Check out Chapter 17 for more on dealing with
weather on a trip.)
213
Chapter 13: Preparing to Hit the Road

Checking Your Riding Gear
Car drivers have a big safety cage and a lot of metal surrounding them — not
to mention airbags — to help protect them in a crash. A motorcyclist has, well,
a helmet, a jacket, gloves, pants, and boots. Since that’s all you have for protec-
tion, you have to be sure to inspect all that safety gear before every ride.
The inspection doesn’t take long. It should just be a quick, thoughtful look at
each piece of safety gear. Thoughtful is the key word here. If you do crash, you
want as much protection as possible. And you don’t need a jacket with split-
ting seams that will explode on impact with the asphalt. Performing this
inspection may help save you from serious injury.
You’ll feel better knowing that your gear is in good shape when you throw your
leg over your motorcycle. The following sections tell you exactly how to per-
form your gear inspection.
Determining whether your 
helmet is in top shape
You need to consider several things about your helmet before you go for a
ride. Fortunately, you need only a couple of seconds to check it out and make
sure it’s ready to protect your noggin. Here’s what to do:
 Consider how old the helmet is. Is it nearing five years old? Sure, you
can still wear it, but to be on the safe side, it’s time to buy a new helmet.
Even exhaust fumes from other vehicles on the road can begin to break
down the protective lining in a helmet after five years.
 Check for deep gouges in the helmet that may compromise the helmet’s
integrity.
 Make sure the chin strap and D-ring fastener are secure.
 Determine whether the faceshield is clean and operating properly. If you
wear a smokeshield during the day and think you may be riding at night
later, take a clear shield with you so you can swap it out when it starts to
get dark.
Examining your jacket, pants, and gloves
When taking a look at your jacket, make sure that all the zippers are function-
ing properly and that the seams aren’t splitting anywhere. If the jacket has
built-in protective armor, make sure the armor is in the right place. For exam-
ple, make sure the elbow armor hasn’t twisted sideways or dropped down so
that it’s no longer protecting your elbow.
214
Part IV: Let’s Ride! 

Also, be sure the jacket is comfortable. Maybe you bought it several years
ago and, well, I’m not going to say you gained weight, but maybe the jacket
has shrunk. If the jacket is uncomfortable to wear now when you hop on the
bike, it may be brutal to wear a couple hundred miles down the road. And it
offers absolutely no protection if you aren’t wearing it. So, if you need to, buy
a new one. Picking out a new one is fun, anyway, and you have a great excuse
to do so.
Examine your riding pants like you do your jacket: The seams should be in
good shape, the zippers should function properly, the padding or armor
should be in all the right places, and the pants should be comfortable. If the
pants are too tight, they’ll hamper your movement on the motorcycle. Get a
bigger pair if necessary.
Your gloves also should be comfortable and show no signs of tearing at the
seams. If they’re old gloves, maybe you’ve almost worn through the leather 
in the palms. Time to get a new pair that has plenty of protection.
As you may have noticed, comfort is turning into a mantra here. Your boots
should be comfortable also: The seams shouldn’t be splitting; the soles should
be securely fastened to the boot; and all the protective stuff, like toe sliders
(if your boots have them), should be attached.
When you’re looking over your riding gear, don’t forget to consider what you
wear under it. T-shirts are popular because you can soak them in cool water
if you’re riding in the hot sun. Some riders like to wear bicycle shorts instead
of underwear for comfort and to avoid chafing. Finally, don’t forget a ban-
danna, to keep the back of your neck from getting sunburned and to soak in
cool water when it’s hot outside.
Performing a Bike Preride Inspection
If you want to have a safe ride, you have to be sure that your motorcycle is in
great shape. Doing an inspection takes just a few minutes. You just need to be
methodical and know what you’re looking for. The first few times you inspect
your bike, it may seem like it takes a long time. But the more you do it, the
faster you’ll be able to complete the task without compromising your safety.
Performing an inspection before every ride points out little problems that can
turn into some major ones through neglect. Some of these problems can even
be deadly. Plus, this type of inspection helps you keep up with the routine
maintenance of your machine, which will keep it running strong. Maintaining
your bike is important not only for your own safety, but also for the value of
the bike, if you ever decide to sell it. (Check out Chapter 11 for more details
on maintaining your machine.)
215
Chapter 13: Preparing to Hit the Road

Taking a look at the tires
The tires really are the most important part of your motorcycle. So, don’t
skimp when you buy them. And be sure to inspect them regularly to make sure
they stay in tiptop shape. Look for these points during a preride inspection:
 How’s the tread? Is there a lot of meat left to the tire, or is it almost bald?
Remember that the contact patch that actually touches the road is very
small, so you need good tread. Why? Good tread translates into good
traction, and good traction means that you have a much better chance
of staying upright on your ride.
 How’s the air pressure? Make sure the tires have the pressure that the
manufacturer recommends. Having the wrong pressure affects both the
feel of the bike and your ability to judge the tires’ traction on the road.
And if that doesn’t convince you, maybe this will: The wrong tire pres-
sure will wear out your tires faster.
 Have you picked up any nails or other sharp objects from the road?
When examining your tires, make sure no nails, bolts, or anything else 
is sticking in the tire and causing it to lose air. Remove any big or sharp
stones from the tread as well.
 How old are your tires? Do they look dried out and have cracks in the
sidewalls? If you’ve had your tires for three years or more, consider
replacing them because they may be hard and not work as well as they
should.
Besides checking your tires, take a look at the wheels they’re mounted on.
Make sure the spokes are tight if you have spoked wheels; if you have cast
wheels, check for cracks. Make sure the sire is seated properly on the rim.
Assessing the lights and turn signals
Too many motorcyclists fail to check their lights and turn signals. These folks
ride away with broken taillights or highlights until the police pull them over.
Operating lights and turn signals aren’t just the law; this equipment is impor-
tant for the safety of the motorcyclist. Here’s what to check:
 Operate your turn signals to be sure that all four are working prop-
erly and flashing at the correct rate. If they’re flashing slowly or they
look weak in brightness, charge your battery. Make sure that the lenses
aren’t cracked and that they’re fastened securely.
 Make sure that the high beam and the low beam of your headlight is
working. You don’t need to do this every time you ride, but do periodi-
cally check to make sure that your headlight is adjusted properly. After
all, you don’t want it to be blinding the drivers of approaching vehicles.
Make sure your headlight lens isn’t cracked as well.
216
Part IV: Let’s Ride! 

 Make sure your brake light is functioning properly. To do this check,
stand on the side of the bike and press the foot break lever and the hand
brake lever while you hold your other hand near the brake light. You’ll
see the light on your hand when the brake light is working. Make sure
your taillight lens is securely fastened.
 Check your horn. You want to be able to signal your presence if some-
one tries to cut you off.
Ensuring that the oil and other 
fluids are at the proper levels
During this part of the inspection, you need to check the fluids in your machine
to make sure that they’re at the proper levels. You need to check the follow-
ing fluids:
 Gas: Without gas, you aren’t going anywhere.
 Engine oil: Not having enough oil in your crankcase can cause some real
problems down the road.
 Brake fluids: Make sure that these fluids are at the correct level in the
front- and rear-brake reservoirs. As you know, brakes are critical compo-
nents. You don’t want to take any chances here.
 Radiator fluid: It’s important to ensure the proper amount of fluid in
your radiator.
Check for any leaks in these areas because they could be a sign of trouble.
For example, if you have brake fluid leaking from your caliper onto your
break disc or fork oil leaking from a failed seal onto your brake disc, you
won’t have any stopping power.
Exploring the condition of the 
chassis and other structures
Make sure your chassis doesn’t have any cracks, especially around welded
areas, and be sure all your bolts and fasteners are tight. Replace any that are
missing. You don’t want to be riding down the road and have bodywork or
other stuff fall off at 55 mph.
The chain should be adjusted properly and should be lubricated. (For more
on adjusting your chain, see Chapter 11.) Sit on the bike, pull in the front
brake lever, and press down on the handlebars to be sure that your front 
suspension is working properly without sticking or leaking at the seals.
217
Chapter 13: Preparing to Hit the Road

Turn the handlebars from side to side to make sure that they aren’t sticking.
Similarly, check your brake and clutch levers, your brake pedal, and your
shifter to check for sticking. Also check your throttle because a sticking or
stuck throttle could be trouble. Check your various cables to determine that
they’re in good shape and that they operate smoothly.
Carrying Passengers and Other Stuff
A motorcycle is a complicated, finely tuned machine that has a lot of compo-
nents working in unison to give you a safe ride. If you add something new to
the mix, like a big passenger on the rear of the seat or a small bag on the gas
tank, the bike’s delicate balance can be upset.
So if you plan to take a passenger on your ride or plan to carry stuff, whether
a little or a lot, you need to add some tasks to your preride checklist. Again,
these points don’t take very long to check, and if you’re carrying the same
passenger all the time, you need to go through this inspection with the pas-
senger only once. However, you definitely need to do this stuff to ensure a
safe ride. And as with everything else in your preride checklist, this part of
the inspection will become second nature after you do it a few times.
Understanding that the 
passenger is a rider, too
Before you take someone for a ride for the first time, you need to teach that
person how to ride as a passenger. After all, you don’t want the passenger
leaning right in a turn when you and the bike are leaning left. That could force
you to ride in a straight line, straight off the road.
Take a few minutes before a ride to talk with your passenger. Explain the
importance of hanging on snugly, breathing normally, and keeping his or 
her body in line with yours, whether you’re riding in a straight line or going
through turns. Tell the passenger to look over your shoulder on the side of
turns instead of looking on the outside. This will help him or her maintain the
correct body position.
Start out slowly with a new passenger, and make all of your actions, such as
accelerating, shifting, and braking, smooth. You certainly don’t want your
passenger falling off, and you don’t want that person’s helmet constantly
banging into the back of yours. Don’t try to show off or scare the passenger:
Riding like this is dangerous and just asking for trouble. Plus, your machine
will act differently with the added weight, so you need to get the feel for that.
218
Part IV: Let’s Ride! 

If you can, adjust your rear shock to make it stiff to account for the extra
weight you’ll be carrying. This adjustment will keep the bike level, which is
important to make sure that the bike steers as it should. It also keeps your
headlight pointed in the proper direction.
Considering the effects of carrying stuff
If you plan to carry stuff on your trip, think about it a minute before you go.
As when carrying a passenger, carrying a lot of stuff on your bike adds weight
and makes it perform differently. You also need to distribute the weight evenly
on the bike so that it doesn’t disrupt the normal tracking of the wheels on the
machine and how the bike operates.
Be mindful of how you attach bags or other items to your bike. You need to
avoid having straps come loose and getting caught in the wheels or chain.
And you need to stop the bag on your gas tank from hampering your ability
to turn the handlebars. (I cover carrying things and packing in Chapter 17.)
Thinking About Your Ride 
Before You Leave
One of the joys of motorcycling is that you can just hop on your bike and go.
But you need to put at least a little thought into it. After all, you do need gas
money, don’t you? Maybe not, but it’s a good idea to carry some. (You can
read about things to take on a ride in Chapter 17.)
Also, you must think about whether you’re heading out on your own or
whether you’ll be riding with a handful of buddies. Or perhaps you’ll be
taking part in an enormous ride, like a Christmas toy run involving hundreds
of motorcyclists. If you’re going on a group ride, give a little thought to how
to do it properly to make sure you and your fellow riders stay safe. For exam-
ple, consider these pointers:
 Don’t get sucked into riding over your abilities when riding in a group.
Some riders like to show off and try to sucker you into keeping up with
them in fast turns or long straights. Let them go. Riders have more respect
for other riders who play it safe and know their limits than they do for
riders who ride over their heads and crash.
 If you’re riding in a group and you come to an intersection and a rider
is far behind, at least one rider should wait at the intersection so the
trailing rider doesn’t get lost. The idea is that the rider who waited at
219
Chapter 13: Preparing to Hit the Road

the intersection knows which way the other riders turned, and can follow.
So even though individuals in a riding group can get separated by several
miles, they still all end up at the same destination.
 If you don’t feel comfortable riding in a tight, staggered formation
with a group, don’t do it. Either ride at the back of the pack or give the
group a 10- or 15-minute head start. If you don’t mind riding in a stag-
gered formation, leave at least a two-second gap between you and the
bike in front of you.
 Show up for the ride on time and with a full tank of gas. Nothing annoys
riders more than having to wait around for a riding buddy who shows up
late — or worse, shows up late and then has to get gas.
 Obey all traffic laws. Don’t get off your bike and block traffic at an inter-
section so that the group can get through. And don’t run a red light to
stay with the group. If some riders get separated from others because of
a traffic signal, they’ll catch up.
 If you don’t know basic hand signals, get them straight with other
riders in the group before you head out on the group ride. For exam-
ple, many riders hold their left arm down to signal others to slow down,
point at road hazards to be avoided with a finger or a toe, and hold one
finger in the air when the group should ride single file instead of in a
staggered formation.
 Have a Plan B in case you do get separated from the group. Know the
destination for the ride, and head there.

ikers have a saying that there are two kinds of motorcyclists: Those who
have crashed, and those who will. Although this sounds like a fatalistic
statement, it’s true. The key to staying safe is reducing risk. And you do that
by learning everything you can about riding a motorcycle safely.
If a motorcyclist gets into a crash, 99 percent of the time, the motorcyclist
likely could have avoided the crash. For example, I have been riding motorcy-
cles for more than 35 years, and have dropped a motorcycle on the street
only once. I got hit by a drunken driver in 1981. But if I had been checking my
rearview mirrors more frequently, I would have seen that drunken driver bar-
reling down on me. I could have avoided the crash by simply accelerating out
of the way.
In this chapter, which is meant for beginner as well as veteran riders, you
explore research on how motorcycle crashes happen so you can avoid falling
down. You discover riding techniques for staying safe, including keeping your
eyes moving to look for dangers around you, accelerating quickly to get out
of a car’s way, braking quickly so you don’t hit a skunk or some other obsta-
cle, and swerving, passing, and cornering. Armed with this info, you have a
solid base for many accident-free miles on the road.
“Officer, I Never Saw the Motorcycle!”:
How Accidents Happen
Motorcycle crash statistics are sobering. Of course, many more people are
injured or killed in car crashes, but many more people drive cars than ride
motorcycles. The number of motorcycle crash fatalities each year has been

going up for about the past decade. Granted, more motorcycles are taking to
the road now than before, but even one motorcyclist fatality is one too many.
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 4,810 motor-
cyclists were killed on the nation’s roads in 2006. This figure is a 5 percent
increase over the number killed in 2005. And it marked the ninth straight year
that motorcyclist fatalities went up. The trend looks like this:
2006: 4,810 fatalities
2005: 4,576 fatalities
2004: 4,028 fatalities
2003: 3,714 fatalities
2002: 3,270 fatalities
Groundbreaking motorcycle crash research done a quarter-century ago (which
I discuss later in this chapter) has provided valuable insights into the con-
tributing factors of motorcycle crashes. The motorcycling community has
learned a lot from it and has taken steps to improve safety where it can.
The Hurt Report
In January 1981, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, part of
the U.S. Department of Transportation, published a landmark study called
“Motorcycle Accident Cause Factors and Identification of Countermeasures.”
Over the years, this remarkable study has come to be known as the Hurt
Report, after lead researcher Harry Hurt, who, at the time, was with the
Traffic Safety Center at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.
Hurt and his team conducted an in-depth study of every motorcycle crash in
the Los Angeles area over five years. Specially trained researchers actually
went to the scene of the crash and gathered detailed information. At the end
of the five years, they analyzed the data, crunched the numbers, and released
the important findings.
So what did Mr. Hurt and his team discover? Put another way, what do motor-
cyclists need to know to avoid crashes? In a nutshell, the team found that the
most common motorcycle accident involved a car driver violating the right-
of-way of the motorcyclist at an intersection: The driver turned left in front 
of an approaching motorcycle because the driver simply didn’t see the
motorcyclist.
To avoid this common crash, motorcyclists must be conspicuous in traffic.
Consider wearing bright clothing, and be sure to position your bike in 
traffic so drivers can see it. Also make sure your bike isn’t riding along in the
driver’s blind spot.
222
Part IV: Let’s Ride! 

At the time of the Hurt research, motorcyclists also had the option of turning
their headlights on or off. No longer. On today’s bikes, the headlights come on
automatically when the bike is started, making motorcycles more noticeable.
Riders can take other steps to protect themselves, too. The Hurt Report
found that motorcycle riders with the following characteristics were over-
represented in the data:
 Inexperience
 No motorcycle safety training
 No motorcycle license
 Little or no protective safety gear
 Poor skills at handling the motorcycle to avoid the crash
So what’s the lesson to be learned from this research? To increase your
chances of staying safe, sign up for motorcycle safety training, wear protec-
tive safety gear (including a helmet), and practice various riding techniques,
such as quick stops and swerving, for avoiding a crash.
Use caution on the road: Slow down when approaching intersections, cover
the clutch and front brake levers with your fingers, and cover the rear brake
lever with your foot to reduce reaction time in case you’re forced to stop
quickly to avoid a crash. Most important, be extremely careful riding until
you get more experience with your bike.
Fatal single-vehicle motorcycle crashes
In October 2001, a report sponsored by the U.S. Transportation Department
and published by the National Center for Statistics and Analysis outlined
some interesting findings related to single-vehicle motorcycle crashes from
1975 through 1999. More than 38,000 motorcyclists died in single-vehicle
motorcycle crashes during those years. Called “Fatal Single Vehicle Motor-
cycle Crashes,” the report analyzed information from the federal Fatality
Analysis Reporting System, which is essentially a database of various infor-
mation collected about all fatal crashes around the country.
So what did this analysis find? See for yourself:
 More riders 40 years old and older are getting killed.
 Most of these fatal single-vehicle motorcycle crashes happened on rural
roads.
 Drunken riding was a major problem.
 Half of the riders died when they failed to negotiate a turn or curve.
223
Chapter 14: Street Survival: Staying Safe

 Almost two-thirds of the riders were speeding when they crashed.
 Almost 60 percent of the crashes happened at night.
 Fewer than half of the riders killed were wearing a helmet.
 Almost a third of the riders didn’t have a motorcycle license.
You can take away some lessons from this research: If you’re an inexperi-
enced rider, even if you’re over 40 years old, be very careful while riding. Be
extra careful while riding in the country. Don’t drink and ride. Know how to
safely navigate turns and curves. Obey the speed limit. Be extra careful riding
at night. Wear a helmet. And get a motorcycle license.

New study on the horizon
Much has changed since the Hurt Report: More
cars are on the road, SUVs have become popu-
lar, bikes are more powerful, and so on. The fed-
eral government has funded a new multimillion-
dollar study into the causes of motorcycle
crashes. The study will get underway in 2008.
When completed, it will offer new insights into
motorcycle crashes and how to avoid them.
Until this study is completed, however, you need
to rely on the former research for insights.
Analysis of the Hurt Report offers a lot of simple
things a motorcyclist can do to help avoid a
crash.
Some other preventative measures, however,
are more difficult and very expensive. For exam-
ple, how do you teach car drivers to make a
conscious effort to look for motorcycles on the
road? Most drivers are looking for approaching
cars when they’re preparing to pull away from a
stop sign at an intersection, so they may not see
a motorcycle. The car driver’s excuse, “I never
saw the motorcycle,” is way too common.
Fortunately, some states are now teaching new
drivers about watching for motorcycles in
driver’s education classes. Some states also
have “Watch for Motorcycles” public safety
campaigns. But we still have a long way to go
in this area.
The federal government is stepping up its efforts,
however, through the U.S. Department of
Transportation. (By the way, U.S. Transportation
Secretary Mary Peters is an avid motorcyclist.)
The federal government is launching programs
to accomplish the following:
 Conduct a motorcycle crash causation
study
 Develop national standards for motorcycle
safety training for beginning riders
 Help road planners, designers, and engi-
neers design, build, and maintain roads with
the safety of motorcyclists in mind
 Promote “Share the Road” campaigns in
states and communities around the nation
to educate drivers to share the road with
motorcyclists

Developing Your Safety Skills
Riding a motorcycle is a lot more intense than driving a car because you have
to watch for so much on the road — and you need to do so much more on
the bike. After you’ve been riding a while, most of what you do is second
nature, like shifting, accelerating, and braking. But until that time comes, pay
attention to what you’re doing and stay alert.
If you’re a new rider, it’s good to develop good riding habits early that will stay
with you the rest of your life. If you’re an experienced rider, whether you want
to admit it or not, you have some bad habits that you need to correct. Both
beginners and veterans can benefit by practicing the basics, which include
constantly scanning the road for dangers, making frequent head checks to see
the traffic around you, maintaining proper lane position, and more.
When you have the basics down and are better aware of what’s around you,
you can work on skills to keep you out of trouble, such as accelerating
quickly, making fast stops, swerving, and executing safe passes. With these
basics mastered, you can hit the road with confidence, knowing that you
have the skills to stay safe and enjoy the ride.
Scanning, head checks, and more
To be safe riding a motorcycle, you need to scan the environment around you
looking for dangers. And really concentrate when you look. You can too easily
get complacent and make quick glances without your brain really absorbing
what your eyes are seeing.
To scan, look ahead of you to see what’s far down the road as well as what’s
immediately in front of you. Look at what’s ten seconds ahead, what’s five
seconds ahead, and what’s immediately around you. Do you see intersections?
Traffic signals? Stopped traffic? Slippery manhole covers? Do you see a bicy-
clist who may suddenly turn in front of you? Make note of it and be prepared
to act.
Also be aware of traffic on either side of you, and know what’s happening
behind you. Constantly glance at your rearview mirrors and make head
checks to your right and left to look into your blind spots. Whew, the road
has a lot of activity going on all the time, and you’re executing a lot of move-
ments and making a lot of decisions while scanning. But if you keep it up, this
practice will become a great habit and will help keep you safe.
225
Chapter 14: Street Survival: Staying Safe

Lane position is vital
A key element for staying safe on the road is the position of your motorcycle
in the traffic lane, and changing that position based on what’s happening
around you. Remember, you have just as much right as a car driver to use the
entire traffic lane, so use it to your advantage. Your goal is to be able to see
traffic and other things around you (and at the same time ensure that traffic
sees you).
Normally, the best place to be on your motorcycle is slightly left of center in
the traffic lane, where the car driver in front of you can see you in his or her
rearview mirror. Generally, riding in the center of the lane is not a good idea
because that’s where oil and other stuff leaking from cars and trucks end up.
But being as near to the center as possible helps the drivers in front and back
of you see you, and it also gives you a little extra room if a car driver from
one of the sides decides to encroach in your lane. You’ve already figured out
what you would do if that happens, haven’t you?
Of course, you don’t always want to be in that lane position. For example, if
you plan to pass a vehicle in front of you, you need to get in the far-left por-
tion of the lane so you can see whether any oncoming traffic is coming far
down the road. Or maybe you need to exit a freeway on an off-ramp that’s on
the far right side of the road. Then you need to be in the far-right portion of
your lane so you can set up your lane changes to get over to the off-ramp.
When negotiating turns, change your lane position to set yourself up to make
the turn or curve safely.
Just as you learned long ago in your driver’s education training, keep a two-
second cushion between you and the vehicle in front of you. You need time 
to react if something goes wrong on the road.
Not all car drivers follow the two-second rule, of course, so sometimes a car
will tailgate you. What do you do? The best thing to do is get out of the way.
Change lanes if you’re on the freeway, or let the car pass if you’re on regular
roads.
Always anticipate what could go wrong, such as a car turning left in front of
you or a big rig changing lanes into you on the freeway. Have an escape plan
before it happens. A lot of motorcyclists play a game called “What If.” They
imagine, “What if that car turns in front of me?” or “What if that dog runs out
into the street in front of me?” Then they form a plan to avoid a crash, in case
they need it.
226
Part IV: Let’s Ride! 

Quick acceleration without laying a patch
Sometimes you need to squirt out of a car’s way or get on the gas to get away
from that pesky mutt that just decided to dart out from his yard to try to snack
on your leg.
If you’re cruising along, just rolling on the throttle to accelerate may not give
you the oomph you need. Then again, it may, so you should know the power
characteristics of your machine. If it does, great! But if it doesn’t, you’ll have
to act fast.
Simply shift down a gear and roll on the throttle smoothly. Don’t just twist the
throttle wide open, or you could end up spitting yourself onto the asphalt. You
don’t have to twist the throttle at a snail’s pace, but you don’t want to just snap
it wide open, either. Be smooth. In fact, make that your mantra for just about
everything you do on a motorcycle: Be smooth.
If you’re downshifting and gassing it to change lanes to get out of the way of a
big car barreling down on you, don’t forget to make a head check and scout
out the traffic around you to be sure your maneuver is safe.
Quick braking: No, you won’t flip over
One of the biggest myths in motorcycling, which some motorcyclists swear is
true even today, is that if you use the front brake of your motorcycle quickly,
you’ll end up flipping yourself over the handlebars. Some motorcyclists use
this myth as an excuse for why they use only their rear brakes — and it also
explains why it takes them forever to come to a stop.
The fact is that most of a motorcycle’s stopping power comes from the front
brake, especially on high-performance machines with large dual disc brakes
on the front. In fact, the stopping power for a motorcycle is something like 
70 percent for the front brake and 30 percent for the rear.
If you think about the dynamics of a motorcycle, this makes sense and also
explains the origin of the myth. When you use your front brakes, the weight
of the machine shifts forward, putting even more weight on the front tire,
which increases traction, which increases the ability to stop. A rear brake has
a single disc that usually isn’t as big as the front disc or discs, so it has less
stopping power. When only the rear brake is used, the weight of the motor-
cycle shifts to the front, which decreases the weight on the rear wheel, which
decreases the traction.
227
Chapter 14: Street Survival: Staying Safe

Many motorcyclists don’t even use the rear brake and instead rely on the front
for all their stopping needs. The front has the most stopping power, and you
can more precisely modulate the stopping power of the front through the front
brake lever than you can modulate the rear brake through the rear brake pedal.
Put another way, it’s easy to lock up the rear wheel and make it slide by apply-
ing too much pressure on the rear brake pedal. That said, though, to stop as
quickly as possible, you must use both the front and rear brakes.
To stop quickly, you don’t grab a handful of front brake and stomp on the
rear brake pedal. Doing so results in one of two outcomes: Either the front
tire locks up and your handlebars twist, possibly tossing you to the road, or
the rear wheel locks up and causes the rear end of the bike to fishtail, again
probably resulting in your unexpectedly getting off the bike.
To stop quickly, smoothly but firmly squeeze the front brake lever and push
down on the rear brake pedal. Again, don’t just grab a lot of front brake and
stomp on the rear pedal. Be smooth.
If the front wheel starts to lock up, let off on the brake lever slightly to get the
wheel rolling again and then apply pressure to the lever again. If the rear wheel
locks up, keep it locked. The problem with letting off on the rear brake after the
rear wheel locks up is that the rear wheel can catch traction again and spit
you off the bike. Practice quick stops repeatedly in an empty parking lot so
that executing them is second nature when you need to do it on the road.
Now you know the technique for stopping in a straight line, but what if you
have to make a quick stop while you’re in a corner? For example, suppose
you’re coming around a curve on a mountain road and there’s a pile of rocks
smack dab where you want to go? In that case, you need to straighten up 
the bike and then apply the brakes. But suppose you don’t have room to
straighten up the bike before braking? In that case, you can slow the bike
while in a turn by lightly and smoothly applying the brakes. As the brakes are
applied, the bike will slow and straighten up, and then you can apply more
brake. This takes practice, which can be done in a large, empty parking lot.
Swerving to avoid that pothole
Another valuable maneuver to practice in an empty parking lot is swerving.
After all, swerving helps you avoid dangers like potholes, manhole covers,
skunks, and even big cars — and swerving is also fun to do.
Okay, consider another weird thing about motorcycling. If you want to swerve
left — that is, make a quick move to the left with your motorcycle — you need
to push on the left handgrip. Yep, it’s true. That’s called countersteering, and if
228
Part IV: Let’s Ride! 

you’ve ridden a bicycle you know how it works. Even though the front tire is
actually moving to point slightly to the right when you do this, the motor-
cycle will lean left and you will go left. Weird. The same is true for swerving
right: You push on the right handlebar. Countersteering is a technique needed
for all turns and curves, and becomes second nature quickly because other-
wise your motorcycle will turn in the opposite direction that you want to go!
This swerving maneuver is a quick one, especially if you’re making a quick
left-right transition to get around something like a pothole. Don’t even bother
thinking about shifting your body position. Just make a quick but smooth
push on the left handlebar and then the right one, to avoid the obstacle.
Suppose a big car is in front of you stopped right on the other side of the pot-
hole or another obstacle. Hmmm, what to do, what to do? Either do a quick
stop before you reach the pothole, or do a swerving maneuver and then
make a quick stop after the pothole. Don’t try to brake and swerve at the
same time because you’ll just end up on your head. It’s very important when
dealing with obstacles in the road to be aware of other possible dangers on
the sides of the obstacles or on the other side in front.
229
Chapter 14: Street Survival: Staying Safe
The limits of traction
Whether you’re accelerating, stopping, turning,
or swerving, you must be aware of traction, or
the grip between your tires and the road. Take a
look at a motorcycle and at the area of the tire
that touches the road. That’s called the contact
patch, and it’s basically on a 4-inch by 4-inch
square. That’s not much rubber on the road. The
reason you need your motorcycle as straight up
and down as possible when you brake is
because that’s when you have the most avail-
able traction and can brake the hardest. When
you’re leaned over, there’s less traction
because an even smaller part of your contact
patch is in contact with the road. So you need
to be very careful how much brake you apply to
slow down.
Besides the lean angle of your motorcycle,
there are other things that affect traction.
Consider these:
 Is there gravel on the road? What about oil?
 Is the road wet?
 Are you riding in an off-camber turn, where
the road angles away from the inside of the
turn?
In all these situations you have less traction
than if you were on a clean road riding your bike
straight up and down. Combine these situations
with a leaned-over motorcycle, and even with
being leaned over while accelerating, and you
can get in trouble in no time. So you have to be
smooth and gradual with your braking tech-
nique. Any careless actions will put you on your
head quickly.

Passing the safe way
Because of their power-to-weight ratio, motorcycles have great acceleration.
Passing other vehicles is a snap, provided that you take steps first to do so
safely. In this case, everything you learned in driver’s ed for cars also applies
for motorcycles.
Get in the left side of the traffic lane so you have a clear view of the road
ahead and any oncoming traffic. When it’s safe, signal your intentions and
check your mirrors. Make a head check to be sure the car behind you hasn’t
decided to try to pass both you and the car in front of you at the same time.
Then smoothly accelerate to get around the car in front of you; signal to get
back into the lane, make a head check, and then do it. Simple.
If you aren’t in the center of the lane when a car or truck decides to pass you,
move over there. This way, the car won’t accidentally clip you when it pulls
out to make the pass. The rush of air from a passing car or truck also could
disrupt your control of your bike a bit, so being in the center of the lane gives
you a little more room to safely recover.
Skills for Taking Different 
Turns or Curves
Motorcycling is all about having fun, and where motorcyclists have a lot of
fun (and most car drivers don’t) is in corners and curves. Some motorcycles
have blinding-fast acceleration that puts your heart in your throat and almost
rips your arms out of their sockets, but all motorcycles lean over in turns.
That’s the nature of the machine. And that leaning is fun.
But those turns also spell danger if the motorcyclist goes into the turns too
fast, leans over too far, or runs into something unexpected in the middle of
the turn, like gravel or that pesky stray dog that’s always hanging around.
Several different kinds of corners require different riding techniques, so a
motorcyclist needs to be able to quickly judge the type of corner or curve
coming up and plan accordingly. Turns vary from something simple, like a
turn from one street onto another, to something more complicated, like 
a steep downhill decreasing-radius hairpin turn that’s off-camber. By off-
camber I mean that the asphalt tilts in the opposite direction of the turn, 
providing for less traction, which can be dangerous.
230
Part IV: Let’s Ride! 

Simple street turn
The basics of turning are simple, whether you’re turning off the street into
your driveway, taking a constant-radius turn on a country road, coming up on
an increasing-radius turn, finding yourself in a decreasing-radius turn, or
tackling a bunch of different turns strung together. The basics are the same:
slow, look, lean, roll.
 Slow: When you’re approaching a turn, slow down. Depending on your
speed, you can just roll off the throttle, roll off and tap your brakes, or
roll off and apply steady pressure to your brakes. You want to have the
proper approach speed for when you enter the corner.
 Look: Look through the turn, not at the apex. Looking where you want to
go ensures that your motorcycle stays on course.
 Lean: Lean the motorcycle into the turn by countersteering. After all,
that’s how motorcycles turn. To turn left, gently press forward on the
left handlebar. To turn right, gently press forward on the right handlebar.
 Roll: Roll on the throttle gently as you enter the turn and then continue
to roll on gently, or hold the throttle steady, through the turn. This stabi-
lizes the suspension so that the bike is steady as you go through the turn.
So to turn into your driveway or onto a street, you slow, look, lean, and roll.
And, of course, you want to avoid any oncoming traffic or other dangers.
Simple constant-radius turn
Most turns or curves you’ll encounter while riding are simple constant-radius
turns, meaning the angle of the turn stays constant through the turn (see
Figure 14-1). Besides applying your slow, look, lean, roll technique, you need
to take other steps to get through this curve safely.
If the turn is a right turn, set yourself up for the turn by getting in the far-left
portion of your lane. Then you slow, look, lean, roll, and ride your bike from
the outside portion of your lane to the inside portion at the apex, or the mid-
point of the turn. Finally, ride out again to the outside of the lane. Taking a
constant-radius turn is simple, but it does take some time to master. Take it
slow for a while until you feel comfortable.
Don’t feel pressured by traffic behind you to take the turn faster than you’re
comfortable taking it. If you take a turn too fast, you may find yourself drift-
ing across the center line into oncoming traffic. If you find yourself in that 
situation, either brake or countersteer to lean the bike over further to keep it
on your side of the road. You’d be surprised at how far over you can lean a
modern motorcycle without crashing.
231
Chapter 14: Street Survival: Staying Safe

Increasing-radius turn
Things get a little more complicated when the radius of the turn changes. An
increasing-radius turn is one in which the turn follows a line that opens up, or
becomes wider, at the end of the turn (see Figure 14-2). This turn is an easy
one to take but does require practice because it differs from other turns.
To take a right increasing-radius turn, you once again set up for the turn in
the far-left portion of your lane. Slow, look, lean, and roll. To negotiate this
turn safely, don’t roll past the apex of the turn. Instead, take what’s known 
as an early apex, making the tightest part of your turn at a point before the
actual apex of the turn. Doing this keeps your bike safely heading in the
proper direction of the turn, which is widening.
Decreasing-radius turn
A decreasing-radius turn is a tough one and takes a lot of practice to master.
As in any turn, don’t go faster than you feel comfortable going, even if that
means you need to slow to a crawl. Going very slow is better than going off
the road and crashing.
A decreasing-radius turn is one in which the turn tightens up on itself, like a
hairpin turn (see Figure 14-3). These types of turns are commonly found on free-
way off-ramps or on-ramps or in the mountains, so there’s no avoiding them.

To take a right-decreasing radius turn, set up for the turn in the far-left por-
tion of your lane. Slow, look, lean, and roll on the throttle. This time, take
what’s known as a late apex. In other words, be on the far inside of your lane
after the middle of the turn. This will enable you to stay in your lane as the
turn tightens.
If you hit the apex of the turn or hit an early apex, you may end up crossing
the center line and be in the path of oncoming traffic. Definitely take this turn
slowly. A decreasing-radius turn gives even experienced motorcyclists trouble.
When you’re approaching a blind corner or turn, treat it as if it’s a decreasing-
radius turn. That turn is the worse-case scenario, so you’ll be prepared for
the worst. If you then find yourself in a constant-radius or increasing-radius
turn, you’ll have no problem navigating successfully.
If you find yourself approaching a series of turns strung together, you can’t
necessarily use your common approach for the first type of turn to make it
through. Look ahead and judge your line through the second turn (or even
through the second and third turns), and plan your entry into the first
accordingly. You have no easy answer here, so just take it slow.

In This Chapter
 Understanding city riding dangers
 Discovering country riding pitfalls
 Handling a stuck throttle and other surprises
Just as when you’re driving a car, you have to stay alert and keep track of
the dangers around you when you’re riding a motorcycle: traffic, bicycl-
ists, kids playing near the road, potholes, road construction zones, and the
like. But a motorcyclist also has to watch for dangers that pose no problem
to car drivers but could seriously injure motorcyclists.
For example, car drivers probably never give much thought to road construc-
tion areas where workers have shaved down one lane of the freeway for
repaving and have put a fresh coat of blacktop on the other. The height of the
two lanes is a couple of inches or more different, and traffic is funneled from
the low lane onto the high lane. If motorcyclists don’t take care in this situa-
tion, they could end up lying on the side of the road.
Or consider railroad tracks that cross a road. Car drivers give them no thought.
Motorcyclists must. If motorcyclists don’t cross the tracks at the right angle,
they, again, could end up crashing.
Road rage is another serious problem for motorcyclists. One car driver may
get angry at another, and the two then exchange angry words and some ani-
mated gesturing. Maybe one driver gets aggressive with the other, pulls in
front of the hapless victim, and puts on the brakes suddenly, or even swerves
toward the other car to try to scare the driver. This situation can be deadly
for a motorcyclist.
In this chapter, you discover how to handle the special dangers of city riding,
uncover the problems that can crop up while riding in the country, and explore
ways to handle various dangers, from a stuck throttle or a flat tire to finding
yourself riding into a corner too fast.

Riding Safely in the City
If you think about it, the city can be a pretty dangerous place for a motorcycl-
ist. After all, there’s a lot of traffic, pedestrians, and even bicyclists who want
to share space with you. While a motorcyclist should be attentive and cautious
no matter where riding, he or she should be especially careful in the city.
As long as you’re aware of some of the dangers you may face, you can deal
with them. As a car driver you may not think much about intersections, but
as a motorcyclist, you must take a good, hard look at what’s happening at
them when you approach. And you must always anticipate the actions of
others. You can also face other potential dangers, such as street construc-
tion, so you must be ready to deal with those also.
Intersections mean special care
Intersections pose a danger to the inattentive rider. Why? Because car drivers,
especially those who have been driving a long time and are on automatic pilot,
simply aren’t paying attention. Sure, they’re looking for approaching traffic
when they’re at an intersection ready to pull out, but they’re looking for cars
and trucks. They aren’t looking for motorcycles. Bicyclists also can appear at
intersections. Or maybe a parked truck or a truck in traffic is blocking the view
of a side street at an intersection. The bottom line is this: Approach intersec-
tions with caution.
The best way for motorcyclists to handle an intersection is to do what they
should be doing while riding anywhere: Be aware of the surroundings. Look
far ahead to see what the traffic situation is like, be aware of the surrounding
traffic (even traffic that is behind), and look for potential dangers. Scan all
around and evaluate the conditions and potential dangers, and have a plan 
to react.
Have a plan for what to do if that motorcyclist at the intersection on the right
decides not to stop at the stop sign but, instead, rides into your path. Have a
plan for what to do if that child on the side of the road darts in front of you.
Be ready in case a driver in one of those parked cars suddenly decides to pull
out into your path. Have a plan for what to do if you’re approaching a stop
sign at an intersection but the car behind you doesn’t slow down. If you don’t
have a plan, you may become a pancake. Be ready for anything.
When approaching an intersection, position your bike in the traffic lane where
it makes you the most visible to other traffic and leaves you a cushion in case
you spot trouble. Normally, that means riding slightly left of the center of the
lane, or, if you’re riding by parked cars, riding in the far left of the lane.
236
Part IV: Let’s Ride! 

Also, when approaching an intersection, slow down. Rest your fingers on your
brake and clutch levers, and have your foot poised over your rear brake lever.
Slowing down gives you more time to react to danger, and covering your brake
levers and clutch lever reduces your reaction time if you need to brake quickly.
Dealing with railroad tracks
The Mr. Know-It-All in your motorcycling crowd may tell you he knows the
best way to cross railroad tracks that run at an angle across the road, and
he’s willing to share his little secret with you. He’ll tell you to swerve so that
you cross the tracks head-on; then he’ll smile smugly. But he’s wrong.
The best way to cross the tracks is to simply keep riding straight. The swerv-
ing technique may be fun, but it also could be dangerous if you aren’t able to
stay in your own traffic lane.
On the other hand, suppose that you have to cross railroad tracks that run
parallel to your path of travel, like streetcar tracks in a city. In this case, Mr.
Know-It-All is right. But the difference here is that you want to get in the next
lane. In this case, swerve so that you cross the tracks at a 45-degree angle.
237
Chapter 15: Advanced Riding Techniques: Staying Safer
The invisible gorilla
As I discuss in Chapter 14, most accidents
between cars and motorcycles happen because
car drivers violate a motorcyclist’s right of way.
The most common crash involves a car stopping
to make a left turn at an intersection or a drive-
way and then pulling into the path of an
approaching motorcycle. The car driver usually
says he or she never saw the motorcycle, or
didn’t see it until it was too late. This happens
even when motorcyclists believe they made eye
contact with the driver and were seen. The fact
is that the driver looked right through the rider.
The motorcyclist may have been completely
legal in what he or she was doing, and the car
driver may have been completely in the wrong,
but the motorcyclist is the one who gets
smashed up when this happens. It takes a con-
scious effort to look for a bike, and most car dri-
vers aren’t making that effort. They simply don’t
see motorcycles.
How can that be? In a study performed by Dr.
Daniel Simons of the University of Illinois and
Christopher Chabris of Harvard University, two
teams of volunteers were asked to play basket-
ball. Other students watched this on television,
and they were asked to count how many times
one team passed the ball. While the volunteers
were tossing the ball, someone dressed in a
gorilla suit ran into the middle of the players,
jumped up and down a few times, and then ran
off. The gorilla was in the scene for about nine
seconds.
Later, when the professor questioned the stu-
dents who were watching this on the television,
he discovered that a lot of them had never seen
the gorilla. Simply put, the student watchers
were watching the people tossing the basketball;
they were “looking for” the people tossing the
basketball and weren’t looking for or expecting
to see a gorilla. They just never saw it. Scary.

Street construction and 
other uneven surfaces
A road construction zone has a lot going on: barriers, workers, heavy equip-
ment, uneven road surfaces, metal plates, gravel, debris, and more. You have
a lot to watch for and think about here. First, slow down to give yourself
more reaction time. You may even want to cover your clutch and brake levers
in case you need to make a quick stop.
If you’re passing through a repaving project and must cross over an uneven
surface, such as from a lane that hasn’t been repaved yet to one that has,
make the move at least at a 45-degree angle. If you try to make the move at a
lesser angle, the uneven surface may catch your tire and kick it back, causing
you to lose control. Also, raise yourself slightly off your seat and increase
your speed a little just before you hit the uneven seam. Your best bet, if you
have a choice, is to ride on the part of the lane that’s higher than the other.
It’s easier to cross from high to low than from low to high.
Those big metal plates that are sometimes placed in the road over giant holes
when work is being done can be very slippery for a motorcycle, especially in
the rain. You handle these like you do any small obstacle, such as a board, 
in the road. Slow down when approaching it, lift yourself slightly off the seat,
shift your weight back a little to lighten the front end, give the bike a little gas
just before you hit the plate, and then hold the throttle steady until you pass
it. If you twist the throttle a lot while you’re on the plate, you’re asking for
trouble.
When you’re on a metal plate or any other slippery surface, such as manhole
covers or the painted markings on a road, be smooth in your actions. Any
sudden accelerating, braking, or turning could cause you to lose traction and
crash. In fact, as a motorcyclist, you should try to be smooth in all your actions
all the time.
As long as you anticipate them, rain grooves and bridge gratings don’t create
any special hazards when riding over them. You may want to slow down as
you approach them. Otherwise, just ride them straight with a steady throttle.
The rain grooves may make the front of your bike twitch, but don’t worry —
it won’t be enough to cause any problems.
The main thing to remember about bridge grates is that you don’t have much
traction on them, so you may want to leave a little extra room between your
bike and the traffic ahead of you. And keep in mind that if there is any wind in
the area where you’re riding, the wind is likely to be stronger on a bridge and
may push your bike around. Be prepared for wind on bridges by keeping a
little firmer grip on the handgrips and being ready to make adjustments in
your steering to compensate for the wind or wind gusts.
238
Part IV: Let’s Ride! 

A stop sign at the top of a hill
Sooner or later, you’ll be riding around a city or town and you’ll come to a
stop sign at the top of a hill. This can be tricky business even for experienced
riders, especially if you’re riding a big, heavy motorcycle.
To stop, approach the stop sign slowly and then pull in the clutch and use both
your front and rear brakes to stop. When it comes time to start, leave your foot
on the rear brake, release the front brake and slowly let out the clutch while
turning the throttle. This takes practice to get the coordination right.
If you need to keep both feet on the road to keep your balance, you can keep
the bike stopped with the front brake, and when it’s time to go, you slowly
release the clutch and brake levers while turning the throttle. Again, this
technique takes coordination in manipulating the brake and clutch levers.
How to handle other (aggressive) drivers
You’re riding down the street, minding your own business, when suddenly a
car driver pulls up quickly on your tail. Then the driver pulls up alongside
and shouts at you, pulls in front of you, and hits the brakes hard. “What the
heck is going on?” you think. The driver may even try to run you off the road.
Road rage. For some reason, this driver is upset with you, and he or she has
the advantage. That car weighs thousands of pounds, compared to the hun-
dreds that your bike weighs, and that driver is surrounded by heavy metal
protection. You’re surrounded by, well, nothing.
Your first thought is to accelerate out of there. After all, that car is no match
for your rocket ship of a motorcycle. Plus, you can weave in and out of traffic
and squirt through small spaces a lot easier than a car can. Although all of
this is true, it’s a bad way to handle a case of road rage. Accelerating away
could lead the angry motorist to speed off after you, and that high-speed
chase could end in disaster. Weaving in and out of traffic is way too danger-
ous also. So don’t speed off.
Don’t stop, either. That could lead to a fist fight, or worse. Your best bet is to
stay calm, don’t react to the enraged driver, maintain your position in traffic,
and try to get to a shopping center, store, gas station, or someplace else
where people are around. Hopefully the enraged driver will leave you alone
after you get to where people can help you, or where you can call the police.
Road rage is only one form of aggressive driving. Other aggressive drivers may
not be targeting you, but they can be just as dangerous. These are the drivers
who are speeding, weaving in and out of traffic, making dangerous lane
changes too close to vehicles, making unsafe passes, and more. Be aware of
239
Chapter 15: Advanced Riding Techniques: Staying Safer

traffic around you. Watch for signs of aggressive driving and stay out of the
way of these drivers. Be prepared to shift lanes, accelerate, or slow quickly,
depending on the danger the aggressive driver poses.
Distracted drivers pose a danger to everyone on the road. You’ve seen them:
drivers talking on cellphones, eating fast-food, dealing with unruly kids in the
back seat, fiddling with the radio or CD player, or even putting on makeup. Be
aware of what drivers around you are doing in their vehicles and steer clear
of those who don’t appear to be paying attention to their driving.
Country Riding: Enjoy the Sights, But . . .
Little is more fun than exploring the countryside by motorcycle. You face little
traffic and can enjoy the sights of cows and horses lazily grazing, wonderful
old farm houses and barns, brightly colored wildflowers lining the road, and
an occasional farmer on a tractor with a friendly wave.
Even though the scene and the riding are peaceful, you still have to stay alert.
A study published by the U.S. Department of Transportation in 2001 showed
that most fatal single-vehicle motorcycle crashes happen on rural roads.
Some of the causes include drunken riding, failing to negotiate a curve, and
speeding.
Country riding also sometimes serves up special challenges for motorcyclists.
Remember those cows grazing lazily alongside the road? Well, sometimes
they wander onto the road. Or imagine yourself cresting a hill only to find a
slow-moving Amish buggy in your path. Motorcyclists who weren’t paying
attention have hit those cows and Amish buggies. This section gives you
pointers for staying safe on your country ride.
Keep your head in the ride
With little or no traffic, it’s easy to go on automatic pilot and not pay much
attention to the road or the potential dangers around you. Just as when
riding anywhere else, you need to scan the road both far ahead and immedi-
ately in front of you. And keep track of all activity around you, from tractors
to animals.
You can still enjoy the countryside while remaining alert to possible dangers.
In fact, you may enjoy the ride even more because you’re noticing not only
things that could pose a danger, but things that don’t, such as the wildflow-
ers or the pine trees and their smell, or the cows and their sme . . ., well, the
cows.
240
Part IV: Let’s Ride! 

Hopefully you gassed up before heading out in the country because gas sta-
tions can be nonexistent. But, on the flip side, if you run out of gas, the near-
est farmer likely will have some around (and will probably give it to you and
refuse to take any cash).
Be aware that if you crash or get into other kinds of trouble, you may be a long
hike from the nearest farm house. So be sure to carry a cellphone so that you
can call a buddy or family member for help or, in the worst case, 911. Having
a riding buddy is best, just in case, but sometimes motorcyclists want to ride
alone. Keep your cellphone in a jacket pocket so that it’s within easy reach if
you crash.
Watch for horse, um, surprises 
and other special concerns
Country roads can get pretty slippery sometimes. With cows and horses
crossing the road, and sometimes leaving slippery presents for you to find,
you have to be careful. You won’t get a lot of traction in these piles, so try to
avoid them.
Farm equipment also crosses the road and sometimes deposits mud or gravel
there. Keep an eye out for this debris, and slow down before you reach it; then
keep a steady throttle.
Motorcyclists also should slow down when taking a blind curve or cresting a
hill. You may come across a slow-moving tractor, a cow, a pile of gravel, or an
Amish buggy. If you end up behind a slow-moving Amish buggy on a straight-
away, you can pass if it’s safe, but consider pulling in your clutch to reduce
your engine noise as you pass so you don’t spook the horse, and give the
buggy a wide berth. (Check out Chapter 14 for more on passing safely.)
Roadkill can be a problem in the country, so keep a lookout and swerve to
avoid it. The same is true for small animals running on the road, such as rab-
bits or squirrels. If it’s too dangerous for you to swerve, go ahead and hit it.
Accelerate slightly and lift your weight off the seat to lighten the front end a
bit. After all, hitting the animal is better than crashing. Of course, this works
only with small animals. Don’t try it with a cow. The old rule of thumb is this:
If you can eat it in one sitting, hit it.
Watch for dogs alongside the road. If one runs out to chase you, slow down,
shift down a gear, and then accelerate away. Easy. Also watch for deer along-
side the road that may jump into your path. In the case of deer, it’s better 
to slow down or even stop until the deer passes. And remember that deer are
social, so if one crosses the road in front of you, you can be sure that one or
more will follow.
241
Chapter 15: Advanced Riding Techniques: Staying Safer

Group Riding: Avoiding Disaster
Most motorcyclists are social creatures, and that makes group rides an impor-
tant part of motorcycling. The group can consist of just a handful of your
riding buddies, or hundreds (or even thousands) of riders for a big event like
a parade or a toy run. No matter how big or how small, a group ride brings
together riders of varying abilities. The most important part of any ride is
staying safe.
Always arrive on time and with a full tank of gas for a group ride so that you
don’t keep the others waiting or make them stop early while you fill up. And
before starting on the journey, be sure each group member knows the desti-
nation and the stopping points along the way, in case someone gets separated
from the group. Also, all riders must know any hand signals that may be used
during the ride, such as signals to speed up, slow down, close up the forma-
tion, turn around, avoid an obstacle in the road, and pull over.
It’s also a good idea to have each rider keep an eye on the rider who follows
and wait for that rider at intersections. That way when the group makes a
turn at an intersection, a rider is waiting there for the rider who’s catching up
so that rider knows which way the group turned.
On the road, a staggered formation, preferably with a couple of seconds
between you and the rider in front of you, leaves the most room for maneu-
vering to avoid danger. Riders also may need to follow single file sometimes,
such as when going through a turn.
Sometimes on big group rides you’ll see one rider get off at an intersection
and block traffic to allow all the riders through, even if the intersection has a
stop sign or a traffic signal. Don’t do this — blocking traffic is illegal. If a light
turns red and cuts a group in half, the trailing group knows where the first
group is headed and will catch up.
If a group is riding faster than you like, don’t push yourself. Let the last rider
in the group, who is usually an experienced rider keeping watch on the rest
of the group, know that you want to ride your own pace and are dropping
back. Again, know where the group is going and you can catch up with the
other riders there. Ride your own ride. Don’t do anything unsafe. You’ll be
respected more for being a safe rider than you would be for riding over your
abilities.
In fact, if the group is large, the riders may want to buddy up into minigroups
of six or so. The riders in the mini group can watch out for each other, and if
they get separated from the bigger pack, that’s okay; they’ll still have fun
riding their own ride and riding in a group.
242
Part IV: Let’s Ride! 

If a group has to pass a slow-moving vehicle, the motorcyclists should pass
one at a time and only when safe to do so. Be sure to leave plenty of room
between the bike and the passed vehicle, to allow other motorcyclists to
make the pass.
Think Fast: Dealing with Dangers
Modern motorcycles are really marvelous machines. Unlike bikes in the old
days, today’s motorcycles are extremely reliable, so not every rider has to be
a master mechanic as well. But even if you keep your machine in tip-top shape,
you may find yourself in trouble, dealing with such things as a stuck throttle
or a broken clutch cable. You need to know how to react to stay safe.
Think about these things before they happen so you don’t have to try to
figure out what to do when you’re faced with a problem. And mechanical
troubles aren’t the only possible dangers you face. You may get yourself in
trouble simply by not paying attention or by making a bad decision. For
example, you may find yourself going into a curve too fast.
Motorcyclists before us have run into certain problems, and motorcyclists
after us will run into the same problems. Fortunately, riders love to pass on
their knowledge, so we know how to deal with just about any potential prob-
lem that could come up. I explain some of them in the following sections.
Coping with a flat tire
Eventually, anyone who puts any miles at all on a bike will get a flat tire. A nail
may puncture a tire, the tire may not be fitted right on the rim, or the valve
stem where you put in the air may leak. If you’re lucky, the tire will go flat in
your garage. If you’re not lucky, it will go flat on the road far from home.
If you have a slow leak, you’ll probably get some warning before the tire goes
flat. If the front tire is losing air, the steering may get heavy or sluggish. If the
rear wheel is losing air, the rear of the bike may start to feel a little soft or
even squirmy. If you experience this, check your air pressure, fill the tire with
air, and find the problem. Then correct it.
If your front tire suddenly goes flat while you’re riding down the road, the front
end will get very squirmy and you may have trouble steering. If the rear tire
suddenly goes flat, it also will get very squirmy.
Keep a firm grip on the handlebars and slow down. Squeeze your knees into
the tank to help control any potential oscillations. Use only the brake on the
tire that isn’t flat. Then safely get off the road.
243
Chapter 15: Advanced Riding Techniques: Staying Safer

Handling a stuck throttle
Throttles rarely stick, but it does happen. A stuck throttle can be disconcert-
ing, especially if you’re in a curve when it happens. When the throttle sticks,
the speed of the motor stays constant or even speeds up — and that can
mean big trouble.
Try twisting the throttle quickly fully open and fully closed a few times to see
whether that unsticks the throttle cable. If that doesn’t work, pull in the clutch
lever so that the power of the motor isn’t going to the rear wheel, and push
your kill switch. This switch is a red on-off button on your handlebar that
turns off the motor.
I recommend always stopping your engine with the kill switch instead of the
key switch. That way, using the kill switch will be second nature when you
need to shut off the engine.
Now you’re coasting. Keep the throttle pulled in and carefully get off the road;
then come to a stop. When you’re stopped, examine the throttle cable care-
fully to see if it’s binding somewhere. The cable may be routed wrong and
may have become kinked; if so, give it a smoother bend between the throttle
and the carburetor.
When the worst happens: Engine seizure
Engine seizure is extremely rare and is generally caused by a lack of oil in the
motor. To keep your motor running correctly, check your engine oil regularly,
and change it as scheduled in your owner’s manual.
A seizing engine basically locks up the motor, which locks up your drive chain
or belt or shaft drive, which locks up your tire, which makes you skid. Not
good. If you don’t react quickly, you may quickly find yourself lying alongside
the road in a heap.
If your engine seizes, quickly pull in the clutch lever so that the motor isn’t
controlling your rear wheel. Then brake carefully and pull off to the side of
the road. If you’re lucky, no damage has been done and you can put in some
oil and be on your way.
If you’re not lucky, it’s time to get a tow. When you call the tow company, make
sure it has a flatbed tow truck rather than a truck that just lifts the front of
the vehicle being towed. Otherwise, you could end up with a lot of expensive
body damage to your motorcycle.
244
Part IV: Let’s Ride! 

If you have a car towing service, check to see whether it also tows motor-
cycles. It probably doesn’t. You may want to consider joining a motorcycle-
specific towing service, such as MoTow, which is available to members of the
American Motorcyclist Association (800-AMA-JOIN). This service handles
your cars also. They know how to tow a bike without damaging it.
Have a wobble? Don’t get on the gas!
A wobble, which is also known as a headshake or a tankslapper, happens when
the handlebars shake violently from side to side. If you suddenly experience
a wobble, the best thing to do is keep a firm grip on the handlebars but not
fight the wobble. Instead of trying to apply force to one handlebar or the
other to “catch” the wobble, apply forward pressure to both. Also, squeeze
your knees into the tank to help dampen the oscillation. Slowly let off on the
throttle to slow down, and pull off to the side of the road. Avoid braking, if
possible.
What causes a wobble? Many times you hit something with your front tire
that momentarily sends the tire off track. Maybe you hit the side of a bump
or you leaned over and hit a bump. Or maybe you’re carrying too much stuff
in the rear, the weight isn’t distributed evenly, or your cargo is riding too
high. Rearrange that stuff.
Or maybe the bike has a problem, such as worn-out steering head bearings, a
bent rim or an out-of-balance tire, or even a tire with low air pressure. Check
for these problems. If you have a sportbike, consider adding a steering damper.
A locked-up rear wheel: 
It doesn’t have to hurt
All motorcyclists have done it: In an attempt to stop quickly, we’ve locked up
the rear wheel, making it skid. We may have even locked up the front wheel,
or both. A skidding tire can be scary the first time it happens, but when you
learn how to handle it, your heart won’t be sent racing. The key to remember
is that you handle rear-wheel skids and front-wheel skids differently.
A rear-wheel skid commonly occurs when you depress the rear brake pedal
too hard. This makes the wheel stop spinning and likely causes the rear 
end to fishtail. In this situation, don’t let off the rear brake pedal. If you do,
the tire could regain traction and spit you off the bike. Instead, keep the
wheel locked, keep a firm grip on the handlebars, and relax. The bike will
straighten out and come to a stop.
245
Chapter 15: Advanced Riding Techniques: Staying Safer

If the front wheel starts to skid, it means you pulled in the front brake lever
too hard too fast. In this case, quickly let off the front brake lever. Then reap-
ply the front brake.
Dealing with a slippery road
Whether you’re facing a rain-slick road, gravel, mud, wet metal plates, or any-
thing else that may make your path slippery, remember to stay smooth. Don’t
accelerate, brake, or turn suddenly. And slow down.
Also keep your bike upright as much as possible. Sure, you have to lean to
take turns or corners in the rain, but if you slow down, you can keep your
lean angle to a minimum. When you’re dealing with patches of mud, gravel, 
or a metal plate, you really don’t want to be leaning when you hit them.
The most dangerous time when riding in the rain is just after the rain starts.
Rain washes up gas, oil, and other vehicle drippings on the road and makes
the road very slick. After a while, the rain washes that stuff off the road, but
until then, be extra careful.
To get more traction, ride in the tire path of the car in front of you, not in the
center of your lane where most oil drips. Remember that you can still get
plenty of traction in the rain — you’re not riding on ice — but you don’t have
the full traction of a dry day.
Handling going into a 
corner waaay too fast
Sometimes riders go into a corner or curve way too fast, which is known as
too hot. Maybe the rider wasn’t paying attention and was looking at some-
thing way off to the left. Maybe the rider misjudged how quickly the corner
was coming up. Or maybe the rider was in a group following a much more
skilled rider. Whatever the reason, getting into a corner or curve too hot
doesn’t necessarily mean that the motorcyclist will crash.
If this happens to you, straighten the bike and brake hard, using both brakes
and making sure that you don’t ride into the oncoming lane. You want to
straighten the bike up so that you have as much traction as possible. The
bike has less traction when it’s leaned over. With hard braking, you may be
able to slow enough to lean the bike over and make the turn. Skilled riders
have a remarkable ability to slow or stop motorcycles in very short dis-
tances, so practice this skill often in an empty parking lot. Be smooth.
246
Part IV: Let’s Ride! 

But suppose it’s too late to brake. You’re in the corner deep already, and fast.
If you straighten the bike and brake, you definitely will end up in the oncom-
ing lane. Well, if no traffic is coming, straighten the bike and use the other
lane. But if there’s any chance at all that traffic may be coming, or if for some
other reason you can’t brake, countersteer and lean the bike over a lot more.
Have confidence in your tires. (They’re in good shape, aren’t they?) A motor-
cycle can lean surprisingly far at speed.
Looking where you want to go
Suppose you’re riding down the road and you see a big rock in the middle of
your lane. You stare at the rock thinking, “I don’t want to hit that big sucker!”
And then, bam! You smack it. You can thank target fixation for that. Target fix-
ation is exactly what it sounds like. You fixate on a target, and that’s where
your motorcycle will go, despite the fact that the target is exactly what you
wanted to avoid.
Motorcyclists need to be aware of the danger of fixating on a target. If a motor-
cyclist sees a big rock, boulder or even a pothole, the rider should immedi-
ately look to the side of it to avoid hitting it.

 Planning a trip like a pro
 Going on some fantastic rides
 Taking an organized tour
 Traveling to great motorcycling events
 Keeping yourself and your bike safe
You’re a motorcyclist, and you want to ride. But where? You’re only lim-
ited by your imagination. Well, your imagination and how much time you
can get off work. Okay, you’re really limited by your imagination, how much
time you can get off work, and how much extra cash you have laying around.
But, in the end, if you want to take a motorcycle trip badly enough, you’ll
figure out a way to do it.
Imagine starting up your bike, clicking it into gear, and then heading out of
the driveway to points unknown. You don’t know where you’re going —
you’re just going. Soon you’re in the countryside riding on a gently curving
ribbon of asphalt. You pass farm houses, pasture land, and grazing cows. Or
maybe you’re headed up a mountain on a winding road. The air gets cooler as
you ascend, and you find yourself riding under a canopy of trees. Before you
know it, the sun is setting and it’s time to head home.
Just pointing your bike out of the driveway and heading off with no destina-
tion is a great way to ride, and something that a lot of motorcyclists do. But
to get the most out of your motorcycling adventures, you need to do a little
planning. After all, without planning you’re relying on dumb luck to take you
past scenic sites and through historic towns.
In this chapter, you find out about the different kinds of trips you can plan,
how to plan them so that you see the scenic and historic sites that are out
there, and discover some great destinations. Plus, you get tips on staying safe
during your ride and, if they’re your destination, at motorcycling events.

Planning a Trip the Way the Motorcycle
Magazine Guys Do
A staple of motorcycle magazines that cater to touring riders is a story about
a motorcycle tour, which is what motorcyclists call a long trip. In these maga-
zines, readers will see stories with titles such as “Riding the Rockies,”
“Touring New Hampshire,” “Discovering New Mexico,” or “Riding in Amish
Country.” How do the writers of these stories (called motojournalists) plan
their trips? I can say this for sure: It’s a lot more complicated than pulling out
a map of a state and running your finger along the squiggly lines that repre-
sent roads from Point A to Point B (although that’s a perfectly good way to
plan a trip, too).
Motojournalists usually have a limited amount of time to get the ride done,
and a limited amount of company money to spend on the trip. (That situation
sounds familiar, doesn’t it?) So they do as much advanced planning as possi-
ble to get the most bang for their company’s buck. After all, a motojournalist
who takes a lot of time on a trip and spends a lot of company money will find
that he or she won’t get too many more assignments to go on a tour.
Fortunately, there are a lot of resources to help you plan a trip. You can request
information from state tourism boards, and you can find tons of tourist-related
guidebooks and scenic-drive books in the bookstores. And then there’s the
Internet, which is great for finding out about specific towns or attractions. The
research can be quite time-consuming if you want to be sure to not miss a
single scenic spot or historic attraction, but the research is well worth it.
If you read motorcycle magazines and their touring stories, there’s usually
enough detail for you to follow the same routes and see the same historic
sites. Some stories even include road maps.
Deciding on a scenic or themed ride
You’re a motorcycle rider, so, of course, you want a scenic trip. The question
that remains is this: Do you want to tax your brain on this trip or just leave it
at home? In other words, do you just want to ride and enjoy the scenery, or
do you want to visit historic sites like Civil War battlefields and learn stuff?
Either decision you make is fine, but what you decide will determine your
research.
Planning a scenic ride can be just as difficult as mapping out a historic one. In
fact, in many cases it may be even more difficult. Here’s why: With a historic
ride you have specific places you want to go, but with a scenic ride you have
to try to find out where all the cool scenery is, and that, my friend, is more
difficult.
250
Part IV: Let’s Ride! 

For a scenic ride, certain things are easy to find out about. In fact, they’re
probably even located on road maps. For instance, waterfalls and high moun-
tain lookouts are often found on maps. On the other hand, some things require
more research, such as areas that have spectacular wild flowers in the spring.
Scenic rides are a lot of fun because you’re using your senses — you hear the
waterfall, smell the wild flowers, and enjoy looking out over the vistas.
Themed rides, like exploring California ghost towns, discovering haunted
Pennsylvania, or checking out historic Eastern Seaboard lighthouses are also
great, but they take a lot longer to ride than scenic rides. After all, you’ll be
stopping a lot to explore your new discoveries.
If you don’t have a lot of time, or you want to spend a lot of time on your bike,
pick a scenic trip. But if you have more time to linger, and you don’t mind
spending almost as much time off your bike as on it, go for a themed, or his-
toric, tour.
Researching great routes
Half the fun of a motorcycle trip is planning the journey. When armed with a
lot of information you can let your imagination run wild. You’ll envision your-
self visiting all the great places and seeing all the great scenery. But, at some
point you have to come back to reality and plan a trip that is doable with
your amount of time and money. The following sections provide some tips on
how to do that.
You can plan your trip as a loop or as a straight line. Loops are more fun
because you get to see a lot more of the countryside and interesting sites.
But if what you want to see doesn’t lend itself to a loop, simply take your
straight-line route and catch an interstate for the ride home. The interstate
isn’t scenic or twisty so it isn’t much fun, but it will get you home quickly.
Gathering your research materials
To gather information about your scenic or themed trip, follow these simple
steps:
1. Contact the state tourism office of the state that you’ll be riding in.
All the states have tourism Web sites you can visit. To find these sites
simply type the state name, followed by the word “tourism,” into your
favorite Web browser. Or you can call the governor’s office of the state
you’re interested in and they can direct you to the state tourism office.
2. Request any brochures related to the area you plan to visit.
Some tourism offices even have recommended scenic driving trips on
their Web sites or in their brochures. Be sure to get those. And don’t
forget to ask for a road map.
251
Chapter 16: Exploring by Motorcycle

3. Go to a bookstore and get a good tourist book related to the state you
want to visit.
There are a lot of books out there, and some are much better than others,
so be very picky before you shell out your cash. You aren’t looking for
the book that tells you about cheap hotels and nightclubs in the cities.
You want a book chock-full of information about scenic overlooks, water-
falls, flora and fauna, rivers and lakes, and the scenic drives around the
state.
Figuring out what you want to see
After you have the info from the state tourism board and the bookstore, sit
back, relax, and thumb through the stuff. See if there’s anything that you really
want to see — a spectacular waterfall or an abandoned insane asylum, for
example. Write these locations down on a piece of paper. When you’re done
thumbing through your material, you’ll have your list of must-see places.
Now pull out your state road map and locate those must-see spots. If they’re
all in one part of the state, you’re in luck. In this case, your dream trip will be
easy to plan. But if you find that some of the places you want to see are in the
northern part of the state and the rest are in the southern, you need to make
some choices. Unless you have an awful lot of time, it’s difficult to cover an
entire state in one trip. It can take days just to see what you want to see in
one part of the state. (I cover how to figure out the amount of time to allot 
for a trip later in this chapter.)
Don’t be wedded to the idea that you absolutely must find specific scenic
sites to see, like waterfalls or mountain lookouts. You may want to plan your
trip so that you’re riding through forest, then through areas where colorful
wild flowers are blooming, and then through farm country.
Mapping out the trip specifics
With the choice made of what part of the state to ride in, it’s time to plan the
specifics of the trip. You want to find good, scenic back roads that link the
historic sites or scenic areas that you want to see. Look at your map, and
look for very squiggly lines representing roads. Those roads are always fun to
ride because they test your riding skills. After all, they’re squiggly for a
reason. Maybe they go up and down a mountain, for example.
Because mountain roads are usually a lot of fun and scenic, pick them out
whenever you can. If you can choose a road that follows a river, do that too.
These roads are almost always scenic, offering glimpses of the river and, if
the river is big enough, barges and boats. Plus, there are usually riverside rest
stops that are great for taking a break and contemplating life (or, if you prefer,
not contemplating anything all). Something else to look for when finding paths
that link your destinations are roads in areas where few towns exist. This is
usually farm country and can be enjoyable even if the roads are straight.
252
Part IV: Let’s Ride! 

After you’ve done all the paperwork, go online and look for scenic routes or
drives in the areas you plan to travel in. You may find some alternate routes,
or you may discover that a bridge is out on one of the isolated roads you
planned to ride.
A good source for this kind of information is the American Motorcyclist
Association’s “Great Roads” database in the Members Only section of the
AMA Web site at www.amadirectlink.com. There, thousands of AMA 
members have posted information on favorite roads in their states.
After you’re done mapping out your route, take another hard look at it and at
the map. Do you see any good back roads you missed that may be better
than the ones you’ve chosen? If not, great! If so, consider revising your route,
even if that includes (gasp!) a stretch of interstate to get from one great back
road to another.
How long will the trip take?
A problem even motojournalists have when they plan trips is that they think
they can fit in way more travel than they really can. It’s surprising how a 100-
mile ride can actually take eight hours or more.
Remember that if you take a lot of twisty, curvy roads on your trip, your ride
will take more time. These types of roads can be slow-going. Why? There are
several reasons, including the following:
 Even on straight country roads you shouldn’t be doing freeway speeds.
 You may end up briefly behind slow-moving trucks, tractors, or even
Amish buggies.
 You’ll likely want to stop at scenic lookouts or even spend an hour or
more touring historic sites.
 You need to eat and take breaks. When you do, you may end up bumping
into other motorcyclists and chatting with them.
All of these things take up more time than you think, so be sure to figure in
extra time for them as you plan for your trip.
If you’re the type of rider who makes all his or her hotel reservations in
advance (rather than just bunking wherever you can find a vacant hotel room
when you get tired at the end of the day), it’s critical that you plan a lot of
extra time into your trip. Nothing is worse than being dog-tired after a long
day of riding and still being 50 or 100 miles away from your hotel room.
253
Chapter 16: Exploring by Motorcycle

After you have figured out how long your trip will take, double it. Once you
make your first trip you’ll have a better idea of how long a tour really takes.
For your first trip, have a plan for hopping on the interstate and heading
home halfway through the trip because you ran out of time.
Dream Rides: Some of America’s Best
Talk to any experienced motorcyclist and he or she will share stories of great
rides through scenic countryside with great sights, good food, and fun camp-
grounds or lodging. Motorcyclists tend to focus on great roads, but you can
string a bunch of them together in an area to make a great trip.
In this section, I introduce you to some areas that make for great riding in the
United States. If you live fairly close to any of these locations, suit up, get on
your bike, and go for it. If you live quite a distance away, don’t worry because
you can still plan your dream ride. Consider flying to a location and renting a
bike there. You can find motorcycle rental agencies by researching online, or
if you call a dealer in the area that you want to visit, he or she should be able
to hook you up with a rental company.
The Great Smoky Mountains
Every motorcyclist should have at least a short list of areas they want to visit,
and the Great Smoky Mountains in Tennessee, North Carolina, and Georgia
should be at the top of the list. After all, the area has everything a motorcyclist
wants: great scenery, great roads, a giant motorcycle rally, motorcycle-friendly
hotels and campgrounds, and a world-class motorcycle museum.
This area also has Deal’s Gap. This road attracts riders from across the nation.
Most motorcyclists just want to be able to say they’ve ridden it. Officially
known as U.S. Route 129, Deal’s Gap sits on the Tennessee/North Carolina
border. Also known as “the Dragon,” this road features 318 curves in 11 miles.
Whew.
The Dragon is unforgiving for those who have more throttle hand than sense.
Take it easy your first time riding it. And consider picking a good lookout
spot near a tight turn and watch the carnage. People crash about every day
at Deal’s Gap. You’ll see sportbike riders crouched down strafing the apex of
the turn, touring riders leaned over so far that the hard parts on their bikes
are touching the road and throwing sparks, and dual-sport riders leaned over
further than you thought possible.
From Deal’s Gap, you can make a loop on the scenic Cherohala Skyway. The
skyway rises a mile high and features a lot of sweeping curves through the
woodlands. After enjoying this road, make your way to Gatlinburg, which is a
254
Part IV: Let’s Ride! 

great tourist town. This town has everything, from fudge shops to a Ripley’s
Believe It or Not Museum.
From Gatlinburg, head to another one of the most famous motorcycling roads
in America: the Blue Ridge Parkway. The parkway stretches 469 miles from
the Shenandoah National Park in Virginia to the Great Smoky Mountains
National Park near Cherokee, North Carolina. This road offers a great ride
with sweeping turns and fantastic views.
While you’re riding the Blue Ridge Parkway, don’t forget to stop by the Wheels
Through Time Museum in Maggie Valley, North Carolina. Owner Dale Walksler
has put together a collection of rare motorcycles from the early 1900s
through today. In fact, he has more than 250 motorcycles on display, and
most of them still run. If you ask him, he may start up something for you to
hear — nothing is quite like hearing the rev of a bike from the early 1900s.
From there, head to Ashville, North Carolina, and visit the Biltmore House.
The house has nothing to do with motorcycling, but it’s a great destination.
Railroad tycoon George Vanderbilt built the 250-room mansion in 1895. Open
for tours, the mansion is worth seeing for the artwork alone.
Do a little research and you’re sure to find a lot more places you want to visit
in the Great Smoky Mountain area.
Southern California
Southern California is considered a motorcycling mecca not only because
major motorcycle manufacturers are based there (Honda, Kawasaki, Suzuki,
and Yamaha), but also because of the great roads. Probably the most famous
road in the area is the Pacific Coast Highway, which stretches up the state’s
Pacific coast. But other roads go inland and attract motorcyclists from all
over the state.
The Angeles Crest Highway outside Los Angeles is a tight and twisty road
that runs through the San Gabriel Mountains. The elevation changes from
about 1,500 feet when you start to about 7,600 feet later in your 70-mile ride.
The views from the lookouts are stunning as you gaze over the San Gabriel
Valley, Pomona Valley, and Mojave Desert.
You can also hook up to the Angeles Forest Highway off the Angeles Crest High-
way. It runs 25 miles north through forest land and provides a nice, relaxing
ride with its long, sweeping turns and views of wildflowers. While the Angeles
Crest Highway is a favorite of the sportbike crowd, the Angeles Forest Highway
is the hot ticket for cruising riders.
The Rim of the World Drive actually is a connection of various roads — state
Routes 138, 330, 18, and 38 — and takes you through forests, past lakes, and
255
Chapter 16: Exploring by Motorcycle

into valleys. The roads have long, sweeping turns, tight, blind corners, turns
that turn back on themselves, and hairpin turns — all of which are a lot of fun.
As with other rides through the mountains, elevation changes are a staple.
The Ortega Highway is another sportbiker favorite. For about 25 miles the
road cuts through forest, drops into valleys, and twists and turns. Sportbike
riders particularly enjoy this road, and sometimes at more-than-legal speeds.
As a result, you can expect a police presence on the road. Obey those speed
limit signs!
Texas Hill Country
The Texas Hill Country northwest of San Antonio is a great place to explore.
The area features beautiful countryside, great views, and fantastic roads. Plus
who doesn’t love to see longhorn cattle in the pastures? The cowboy town of
Bandera is a good place to start your ride.
Head up Highway 16 toward Kerrville and you get a taste of what’s to come:
gentle sweepers, sharp bends, and yellow and purple wildflowers. Then you
start heading into the hills, and the turns get tight. Your journey takes you
past working ranches, longhorn cattle, and spectacular vistas.
The historic town of Fredericksburg offers a taste of Germany in the middle
of Texas. Luckenbach on Farm Road 1376 is a great place to stop and chat
with other bikers. And, if you’re lucky, you’ll run into an impromptu bluegrass
performance complete with banjos and washtub bass instruments.
The area around Llano, Texas, features some spectacular fields of yellow
wildflowers. And Farm Road 1431 is a challenging roller-coaster ride through
woods and past lakes, featuring sweeping curves and tight turns. Believe me
when I say this road is a lot of fun.
Northern Pennsylvania
If you want to mix a little history with your scenic riding, the oil country
around the Allegheny National Forest in northern Pennsylvania is a great
place to go. Not only does the area feature some great roads, but it also has
an interesting history as a major oil-producing area. In fact, the McClintock
No. 1 Oil Well, between Rouseville and Oil City, has been producing oil contin-
uously since August of 1861.
Oil City is rich in history, and a great place to start a trip. From there, you can
take scenic roads through lush forest, including state Route 666, which is a
fun road with a lot of tight twists and sweeping curves. You’ll go through
256
Part IV: Let’s Ride! 

forests, farm lands, and small towns on your journey, and you’ll spend some
time going up and down mountains.
The 2,053-foot-long Kinzua Bridge — a railroad bridge first built in 1882 and
rebuilt in 1900 — that spanned a valley near the mountain town of Mount
Jewett was once a spectacular sight. It still is worth seeing, but a tornado in
2003 destroyed the middle part of it. And don’t forget to drop by the Zippo
lighter museum in Bradford, Pennsylvania. Be sure to pick up a cool lighter
with a motorcycling design.
Louisiana Bayou Country
You can’t go to Louisiana without going to New Orleans, and the French
Quarter is the perfect place to start a ride through Louisiana’s Bayou
Country. Park, soak in the music, eat shrimp, and enjoy the street performers.
Then hop on your bike and head west on U.S. Route 90.
Soon you’ll be riding through swamps and past Spanish moss-covered trees.
It’s eerie, really. You won’t want to miss state Route 307 with its tight turns,
sweeping long curves, and short straights.
While you’re in Bayou Country, try eating some alligator, or maybe take a
swamp tour to see those critters poking their heads out of the swamps.
Whatever you do, don’t forget to sample some of the Cajun cuisine, and
check out the antebellum homes.
Southern Arizona
For a glimpse of the Old West and for some great riding, head to southern
Arizona near Tucson. In fact, a great place to start your trip is at Mt. Lemmon,
an 8,000-foot-high peak just outside Tucson. This peak takes you on a 25-mile
ride from the desert floor to the snowy tip.
Next, ride through the Saguaro National Park, one of Arizona’s best scenic
routes. Some of the giant cacti there rise 50 feet in the air. A can’t-miss stop is
the Old Tucson Studios, where Hollywood re-created the Old West. Some of
the films shot here during the studios’ heyday include Gunfight at the OK
Corral, Cimarron, Rio Bravo and Hombre. In more recent days, The Frisco Kid
was shot there.
After hitting the Old Tucson Studios, head south on Interstate 19 toward the
town of Nogales. From Nogales, hop on state Route 80 and go to Tombstone.
The ride features views of cattle ranches and wineries. And of course, you
can’t get more Old West than Tombstone.
257
Chapter 16: Exploring by Motorcycle

Riding with an Organized Tour
Planning a trip takes a lot of effort and can be stressful. You have to figure out
the routes, and you have to determine where to spend the night. And to top it
all off, you may not be sure that you picked the best roads. (I explain how to
take care of all this earlier in the chapter.) And who will help you out if you
get hurt or wreck your bike?
One way to avoid all this hassle is to go on an organized motorcycle tour. The
tour guides do all the work — ensuring you ride the best roads and have places
to stay each night — and you have all the fun. It’s a great way to take a vaca-
tion and share the camaraderie of like-minded riders.
These tours are usually one day to two weeks long and can cost up to $3,500
or more, depending on the length and locale. On some tours, you ride your
own bike, but on others the tour company supplies the machine. In the fol-
lowing sections, I explain all you need to know about finding a tour for you,
whether it’s in the United States or across the pond.
Hooking up with an American tour
Tons of companies offer motorcycle tours in the United States. After all, who
wouldn’t want to combine their passion for motorcycling with travel? The
tour companies range from outfits that offer different tours in various parts
of the country to a couple of buddies who offer just one or two rides a year in
a favorite area of their state. And remember that motorcycle tours aren’t just
for street riders. If you like dual-sport or dirt riding, there’s a tour for you.
If you want to ride in a certain part of the United States, you can find a tour
company to take you there. Check out motorcycle magazines for the ads of
touring companies, and then call them up and have them fill your mailbox
with brochures that describe the wonders you’ll discover on a motorcycle
tour. If you check out local or regional motorcycle publications, you may
even find some tours in your state. And don’t forget the Internet. It can be a
great source for locating tour companies.
Do a little research about the company before you sign up for a tour. Ask the
company for the names and addresses or telephone numbers of some riders
who have taken their tours. Check with the local Better Business Bureau to
see whether any complaints have been lodged against the company. And be
sure you understand the company’s refund policy in case, for some reason,
you can’t go on the trip.
Some companies that specialize in American trips are

Motorcycling Happenings: You and 
Your 500,000 New Best Friends
It’s always fun to have a destination when you ride. And what could be more
fun than having a destination where hundreds, or maybe even thousands or
tens of thousands, of other motorcyclists will be? Not much else, huh?
You can find thousands of motorcyclist events throughout the country year-
round (yes, there’s even a midnight ride in Michigan on January 1). So with
that many to choose from, it’s easy to find a rally or gathering that’s right up
your alley. (I cover ten must-see events in Chapter 18.) Whether you’re a tour-
ing rider, sportbike rider, or a cruiser, there’s bound to be an event where you
will feel right at home.
260
Part IV: Let’s Ride! 

Events range from Daytona Bike Week in Florida, which attracts 500,000
motorcyclists, to smaller local rides for charity. You’re almost guaranteed 
to have a good time at any of them. After all, you’re with your motorcycling
brothers and sisters!
The easiest way to find these events is at the Web site of the American
Motorcyclist Association (www.amadirectlink.com). The AMA sanctions
thousands of events each year. The events also are listed each month in the
association’s magazine, American Motorcyclist. Call 800-AMA-JOIN
(800-262-5646) to join the association and get the magazine.
Checking out the big events: 
Bike weeks and rallies
Some rallies are so big, popular, and historic that they’re known by one name:
Daytona, Sturgis, Laconia, Americade. These events are Daytona Bike Week in
Florida, the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in South Dakota, Laconia Bike Week in
New Hampshire, and the Americade Rally in New York.
These events attract 25,000 to 500,000 motorcyclists, and every motorcyclist
should attend one of them at least once. There are diehards who go to Daytona
or Sturgis every year. What makes these special isn’t just that you’re with so
many other bikers. The best part is that there’s a real festival atmosphere
with vendors, bike test rides, bands, custom bike shows, and sometimes even
cole-slaw wrestling!
These events are so big that you have to plan far in advance or you won’t
even find a campground to pitch a tent (let alone a hotel room). Expect the
hotel room prices to jump during the days of the event. Nobody said that
having fun as a motorcyclist was cheap.
Satisfying your fix with the smaller events
Massive events like Daytona or Sturgis happen once a year and are a lot of
fun. But you need your motorcycling fix year-round, right? That’s where
smaller events come in. With these you won’t have to fight humungous
crowds or pay jacked up hotel-room rates. In fact, you probably won’t run
into many expenses at all. Plus, these are events that you’ll be able to find
near your home. And you can probably find one every week.
Some regional rallies mimic the big ones but aren’t as large in scale. They’re a
lot of fun and give you a taste of what the big ones are like. Also fun are state
rallies and local rides. These are even smaller than the regional rallies but
261
Chapter 16: Exploring by Motorcycle

still satisfy your need to ride and be around other motorcyclists. All of these
rides are sanctioned by the American Motorcyclist Association, so you can
find out about them through the AMA Web site or magazine. Or ask at your
local motorcycle dealership about rides in the area.
Here are some organized rides where you’re always welcome:
 Gypsy tours: These are organized rides that usually lead to a scenic
location. They have a long history that stretch back to the early 1900s.
 Poker runs: With these rides you stop at checkpoints along the way and
pick a playing card or a number. Prizes are awarded at the end of the ride.
 Toy runs: These charity rides take place prior to Christmas. Each rider
brings a toy and at the end of the ride all the toys are gathered up and
given to needy children for Christmas.
 Cruise-in or Bike night: These events are gatherings of motorcycles at a
restaurant or dealership. They’re usually on a weeknight and were basi-
cally created so that bikers can have an excuse to ride there and share
the camaraderie of other bikers.
You don’t need to have a bunch of riding buddies to go for a ride. Organized
rides happen all the time, and the organizers welcome strangers. These rides
are a good way to meet people, maybe ride in an area you haven’t ridden
before, and just have fun for a day.
Riding on race day
Don’t forget the races! While not all car drivers like car racing, almost all
motorcyclists like bike racing. It’s fun to ride to a race and then watch the
race bikes in action. As an added bonus, you get to hang out with fellow
motorcyclists.
There are a lot of different forms of motorcycle racing, but three offer the most
excitement and most festive atmosphere. These three include the following:
 Professional roadracing: This type of racing takes place on asphalt
courses. Professional motorcycle roadraces, where the bikes hit top
speeds of close to 200 mph, are held on famous tracks such as the
Daytona International Speedway in Florida, Mazda Raceway Laguna 
Seca in Monterey, California, and the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course in
Lexington, Ohio. International roadrace stars appear at races at Laguna
Seca and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Indiana.
These high-speed battles are always thrilling to watch. But there’s also a
lot of excitement off the track, particularly in the vendor area where you
can shop for new riding gear like helmets, jackets and gloves. Of course,
262
Part IV: Let’s Ride! 

you can also gawk at the many bikes that spectators rode in on and eat
some track food.
 Flat-track or dirt-track racing: Dirt-track races are usually held at fair-
grounds on mile- or half-mile-long dirt ovals that are usually used for
horse racing. Dirt track racers hit top speeds of 140 mph on the straights
and throw their bikes sideways to slide around the corners. You can count
on finding vendors and track food at these races. The Springfield Mile in
Springfield, Illinois, and the Peoria race in Bartonville, Illinois, are a
couple of the more famous ones.
 Supercross: Supercross racing, which is held in football stadiums, has
grown to be extremely popular over the years, even among nonmotor-
cyclists. It’s great entertainment, with loud music, flashing lights, and
spectacular racing on tight dirt courses with hills and tight turns. Racers
sometimes even do tricks when they take the big jump at the finish line.
The season starts in Anaheim, California, and ends in Las Vegas, Nevada.
You can get complete racing schedules at www.amaproracing.com or in
American Motorcyclist magazine. The AMA sanctions all the races.
Special Precautions for 
Attending Any Event
Attending a major biker rally, such as Daytona Bike Week or Sturgis, can be
an overwhelming experience. Every street is packed with motorcycles, every
sidewalk is filled with people, and every store has patrons elbow to elbow
looking at jackets, chaps, vests, and other motorcycling goodies. Imagine
Mardi Gras in New Orleans and you get the idea.
Unfortunately, not everyone attending a big motorcycling event, or even a
smaller rally or a race, is a motorcyclist. Yep, like every other major event,
bad guys are always around. Unlike other major events, though, you don’t
just have yourself to worry about. You also have to worry about your bike.
With so many motorcycles at an event, you have to worry about getting hit
while riding. On the sidewalks, you’re bound to come across pickpockets. But
even if you’re walking around and feel personally safe, what about your bike?
After all, some goons could be lifting it up and throwing it into the back of a
pickup truck at the same time you’re wondering whether your bike is okay.
But never fear. You can take some precautions to help ensure your own safety
and to keep your bike your own, whether you’re at a major mega-event or a
local rally. I explain everything in the following sections.
263
Chapter 16: Exploring by Motorcycle

Staying away from danger
Daytona Bike Week and Sturgis are a couple of must-see biker events, and
because of that they attract hundreds of thousands of motorcyclists. Plus,
these events are week-long parties. And partying means booze and show offs
doing burnouts, wheelies, or other stunts on their bikes. Then there are those
folks who are simply riding too fast.
Having said all that, here’s my advice: The first thing you need to do is not
drink and ride. Even one drink can affect your ability to operate your motor-
cycle. It takes a lot of skill and coordination to ride a bike, and a lot is going
on around you while you ride at a mega-event. So don’t risk crashing by
drinking.
So you’re at Daytona Bike Week sipping your lemonade. But what about the
other 499,999 bikers there? You can bet they aren’t all as smart as you. That
means you have to be aware of the motorcyclists around you. For instance,
be sure to watch for the bikers making a little too much noise with their bikes,
those having a difficult time operating their machines at slow speed, or those
approaching intersections from side streets too quickly. These riders may not
even be tipsy. They may just not be paying attention to the right things, such
as that stop sign in front of them.
When you’re on the road, use all the techniques you learned in your motor-
cycle safety training course. Scan the road ahead, watch for dangers on the
side streets, expect the unexpected, keep a safe distance between bikes, and
don’t ride next to another biker. Be extra cautious on the road because you
also have to worry about car drivers. And watch for pedestrians. (Check out
Chapter 3 for more on bike safety and training.)
After you park your bike and head off on foot, you can stay safe by taking the
same precautions you would in a major city or at an event such as a football
game. Just stay alert, be aware of your surroundings, stay near people, and
keep your wallet in your front pocket or your purse clutched tightly on the
side that your friend, if you have one with you, is walking on.
I don’t say all of this to scare you. I only want to prepare you. You can safely
enjoy a major event like Daytona Bike Week or Sturgis even at the heart of the
action, as long as you stay alert and are careful.
Keeping your bike from getting stolen
Dealing in stolen motorcycles is lucrative for thieves, whether it’s shipping
entire bikes overseas or stripping bikes and selling the parts. And major bike
events, or even smaller ones, offer bike thieves the opportunity to take what-
ever kind of bike they want, because all kinds are there.
264
Part IV: Let’s Ride! 

Law enforcement recently busted a multistate motorcycle theft ring that trav-
eled to major motorcycle rallies to steal bikes. They would take an enclosed
trailer to the rallies, steal bikes, and dismantle them right inside the trailer. In
other words, don’t think it can’t happen to you, because obviously it can.
A determined thief will take your bike no matter what. But you can take some
steps to help protect your machine. Here they are:
 A motorcycle cover is a good idea. You can get a cover at any bike shop.
When you’re at a rally or race, or anywhere, for that matter, just throw
the cover over your bike. That way, a thief won’t know whether there’s a
great machine under the cover, or a piece of junk. And believe me, a thief
won’t want to take the time to find out when there are easier pickings. A
good cover will have metal rings or grommets on the bottom so you can
padlock the cover. That way no one can easily walk off with it.
 Get a lock for your motorcycle. A good lock will make your bike difficult
to roll away. Use either a motorcycle lock or a padlock through a hole in
your brake rotor.
 An alarm built specifically for motorcycles is helpful. Some even come
with remote pagers so that you know when someone’s trying to move
your machine.
 Your motorcycle should have a built-in fork lock that locks the forks
cocked to an angle. Be sure to use that. Every little bit helps deter
thieves.
 Park in a place with a lot of people around, and try to position your
bike so it’s difficult for a truck or van to get close to it. Thieves usually
just roll up in a truck or van, lift and throw the machine in the vehicle —
even if it’s locked up — and take off.

Travel Tips: What You Need to
Know from Weather to Luggage
In This Chapter
 Discovering how to cope with bad weather
 Exploring how to carry stuff while traveling by bike
 Making sure you pack everything you need
I
f you’re like most motorcyclists, you like to travel. It’s in your DNA. For you,
a romantic notion is to hop on your bike and take off for points unknown.
You may take a day trip to another part of the state or a two-week-long trip
across the country. Maybe you have a destination. Maybe you don’t. You just
like to get out in the fresh air, enjoy the sounds of the motorcycle and the
sights of the countryside, and be alone with your own thoughts. No cares. No
worries. No cellphone. Well, okay, maybe you have a cellphone. But it’s not
turned on.
To get the most out of any trip, though, you must be prepared, especially for
a cross-country jaunt. That doesn’t mean you have to plan every hour of
every day — arriving here at this time, eating there at that time, or sleeping
in this hotel or at that campground in this town on a certain night. But you do
need to be prepared for the speed bumps that inevitably will show up during
your trip. You need to take essential items so that you don’t find yourself 
contemplating life at a scenic lookout and suddenly slapping your head and
saying, “Shoot, I wish I would have brought an (insert your particular essen-
tial item here).”
In this chapter, you explore how to deal with different weather conditions so
that your dream ride doesn’t turn into a nightmare. After all, violent thunder-
storms can, and should, send you scurrying to the nearest hotel. But rain
shouldn’t stop you from enjoying your trip. Extreme heat can make you mis-
erable on your ride, unless you’re prepared. And cold? Cold weather can be
dangerous, but motorcyclists who ride year-round attest that not only can it

be done comfortably, but it can also be a lot of fun. I also give you tips on
how to safely carry all the stuff you need to take, and I advise you as to which
essential items you need to pack, whether you’re going to be away from
home for a day or a week.
Exposed to the Elements: 
Coping with Weather
Part of the fun of motorcycling is that you get to experience the weather. You
aren’t riding down the freeway or along great country roads locked up in a
box with artificial climate control. Car drivers are likely to tell you that they
would never ride a bike a long distance because they wouldn’t want to get
caught in the rain, the blazing heat, or the cold. But riding in different kinds
of weather is part of the motorcycling experience.
Coping with weather is no problem as long as you remember a few important
points. For instance, you need to do the following:
 Pack the right riding gear.
 Know and watch for the signs that indicate the weather may be affecting
your ability to ride, not only because of the elements, but also because
of what it may be doing to your body.
 Recognize when the weather affects your ability to think clearly and
react to possible dangerous situations.
It’s obviously important to think about the weather when you hop on your
bike and take off, but you also need to anticipate what it will be like when you
return, whether that’s in six hours or six days. Unless you’re taking a one-way
trip, you’ll be exposed to the elements both coming and going, and you need
to plan accordingly.
Riding in the rain the safe way
Rain doesn’t have to prohibit you from riding. In fact, you may find that some
of your most enjoyable rides are on spring days in a light drizzle when the air
is cool and the trees and flowers smell sweet. When the rain starts pounding
a little harder, however, riding can get more challenging. You need to remem-
ber a few certain things when riding in the rain — whether it’s a drizzle or a
downpour.
268
Part IV: Let’s Ride! 

If lightning is nearby or if it’s raining so hard that you can hardly see, pull
over. Stop under a freeway overpass (but do remember to climb up away
from the road), go to a restaurant and have some coffee or a leisurely meal,
or go into a gas station. Talk to some folks to see what they’ve heard about
the weather. Or if you’re one of those high-tech people, pull out your handy
cellphone that allows you to download satellite weather images. Either way,
determine whether the storm will pass quickly. If it appears that the storm
isn’t going to let up for quite a while, hole up in a hotel. In fact, if you’re plan-
ning a long trip, add an extra day or two in case you need to kill a day in a
hotel because of bad weather.
Tweaking your driving techniques
Riding in the rain changes the way you drive because
 Your tires have less traction on the road.
 Your brake discs are wet (meaning that you have less stopping power).
 Your vision may be impaired because of rain on the faceshield of your
helmet.
 Car drivers may be even less likely to see you than they normally are
because of poor visibility and their concentration on the weather.
Rain also can affect your ability to control your machine if you’re uncomfort-
able because water soaked through your jacket, boots, and gloves.
The most dangerous time for a motorcyclist is just after it starts raining.
Why? The rain mixes water with gas and oil on the road, making for a slick
surface. It stays slick until the rain and cars force the dangerous mixture off
the road. Road markings, railroad tracks, metal plates, and manhole covers
are also all extremely slick when it rains, so be very careful if you need to 
ride over them.
Everything you do while riding in the rain must be smooth: shifting, acceler-
ating, braking, changing lanes, leaning, and turning. With reduced tire trac-
tion in the rain, any jerky or fast movements are amplified, and you may not
recover from them. Instead, you may find yourself sliding off a turn into a
ditch. Following are some tips and tricks to stay safe:
 When riding in the rain, remember that your brakes, for a split-second,
initially won’t have the stopping power you expect because of water
on the brake discs. This lack of stopping power will only be momentary,
but it can mean the difference between hitting something and not hitting
something if you don’t anticipate that you won’t have initial grip on your
brake discs by your brake pads.
269
Chapter 17: Travel Tips: What You Need to Know from Weather to Luggage

 If it’s absolutely pouring, ride your motorcycle in the path of the tires
of the car in front of you. This path offers more traction than the rain-
covered road on either side of it. But if it’s raining that hard, it’s proba-
bly best to get off the road. Find a restaurant or hotel or pull over.
 Wipe the rain from your faceshield occasionally to improve your
vision. You can wipe it with your gloved hand. Some gloves have a little
squeegee on the finger made for clearing the rain off your faceshield.
Another trick, if you don’t want to take your hands off your handlebars,
is to turn your head to the left or right briefly. The wind will push the
rain off the side of your faceshield.
Suiting up in rainproof riding gear
To keep from getting soaked while riding in the rain, you need a good one- or
two-piece rain suit. A rain suit is waterproof, of course, with sealed seams, a
snug fit around the neck and ankles, and usually some big, waterproof pock-
ets. Note: Be aware that some rain suits made out of a plastic material can
make you very hot. And one-piece rain suits seem to work better than two-
piece suits to keep you dry, but they’re more of a hassle to get into and out of.
Make sure your rain suit is big enough to wear over your riding clothes. In
fact, you should probably try on your rain suit over your riding clothes in the
store before buying it. That way you make sure it fits properly. If it’s too tight,
the seams could split.
If you get caught in the rain without a rain suit, go to a store and buy a cheap
raincoat or even a garbage bag. These options may not be very stylish, but at
least they’ll offer a little bit of protection.
Riding in the rain with sopping wet gloves can be uncomfortable, and even
dangerous, because it affects your ability to control the clutch and brake
levers. So, carry a pair of waterproof rain gloves or rain covers to go over your
gloves, in case you get caught in a downpour. Similarly, if you think you may
get caught in the rain, wear waterproof boots — or at least water-resistant
boots — for the ride. Wet boots have the same affect on your feet as wet
gloves do on your hands. Wearing soaking wet boots not only can make you
uncomfortable, but it also affects your ability to manipulate the shift and
brake levers with your feet.
Paying attention in extreme heat
Riders don’t stop riding because it gets a little warm outside. Granted, 90-
and 100-degree heat can get pretty darn uncomfortable. Luckily there are
ways to cool down and keep the ride enjoyable. Just always remember that
extreme heat can be dangerous.
270
Part IV: Let’s Ride! 

Beating the heat and staying safe
While riding in heat, plan to take a lot of breaks so that you can drink some
water and relax in the shade or in an air-conditioned building. The key to sur-
viving hot-weather riding is lots and lots of water. Even if you aren’t thirsty,
you need to drink water to avoid dehydration and heat stroke. Sports drinks
are also good.
If you plan a lot of hot-weather riding, consider buying a backpack-style hydra-
tion system. This type of system is essentially a bladder (which you fill with
water) in a little backpack. A drinking tube runs from the bladder to the front
of your jacket. Then you can take cool sips of water as you ride along. Taking
a lot of cool sips while riding is a much better way to battle the heat than
gulping down water every hour or so during stops.
Ride in the early morning and late afternoon, when it’s cooler. Avoid the blaz-
ing midday sun. You should wear a bandanna around your neck to keep the
area between your jacket collar and your helmet from getting sunburned. A
bandanna can also make a great ice cube holder to help keep you comfort-
able. For example, during a rest stop, put some ice cubes in the bandanna
and then tie it around your neck. This helps to cool your blood a bit as it cir-
culates to your brain. If you’re wearing a T-shirt, you can soak that with cool
water too.
On warm days many times you see riders not wearing safety gear. They may
tell you it’s just too hot to wear a helmet, or jacket, or boots, or even gloves.
Wear them. This is safety equipment, not I’ll-only-wear-it-in-comfortable-
weather equipment. Plus, not wearing a jacket makes you more prone to
suffer from heat stroke during a ride and causes you to dry out faster, as the
hot wind rushes by your upper torso.
You should have hot-weather riding gear: a ventilated jacket, pants, gloves,
and boots. For a reasonable price, you can even get a mesh jacket with lots 
of protective armor to wear on really hot days. Open up your vents, including
the ventilation in your helmet.
Watching out for signs of heat exhaustion or heat stroke
You know your body well. Listen to it. Watch for signs that you may be headed
toward heat exhaustion or heat stroke. Signs of heat exhaustion include
 Clammy skin
 Dizziness
 Headache
 Muscle cramps
 Excessive sweating
271
Chapter 17: Travel Tips: What You Need to Know from Weather to Luggage

 Weakness
 Slow thinking or getting foggy in the head.
Heat stroke is even worse, and can be debilitating. Signs of heat stroke include
 Hot, dry skin
 Increased heart rate
 Incoherent or slow, slurred speech
 High body temperature
 Difficulty concentrating
If you think you may be overheated, end your ride for the day. Check into a
hotel and cool down. Relax. If you’re near a fire station, pull in and ask for
help. Firefighters know how to cool you down so you don’t pose a danger to
yourself and others.
It’s really cold up in them thar 
hills: Traveling in winter
Winter isn’t the only time that you can face riding in some really cold weather.
Just getting up into the mountains can pose a danger unless you’re prepared
and recognize the signs of trouble. By anticipating and dealing with the cold,
you can make cold-weather riding enjoyable.
When riding in the heat, you need to guard against your body temperature
elevating. The opposite, of course, is that when riding in the cold, you need
to guard against your body temperature dropping. Low body temperature
can pose a real danger, clouding your ability to think and to properly control
your motorcycle.
When riding in the cold, take breaks so you can warm up in a restaurant or
gas station, and drink plenty of fluids. Dehydration is just as much of a danger
in cold weather as it is in hot conditions. Watch for shivering, numbness, and
clouded thinking. Try not to reach that stage, but if you do, go warm up.
Cold weather requires you to dress accordingly. Cold-weather gear includes a
jacket and pants with a cold-weather lining, lined boots and gloves, and, of
course, a full-face helmet. Dress in layers for the ride, and make sure all of
272
Part IV: Let’s Ride! 

your skin is covered. The wind chill from riding in the cold can make riding
with exposed skin unbearable. Make sure your gloves have gauntlets that go
over the wrists of your jacket so that your wrists aren’t exposed, and wear a
bandanna around your neck to protect the skin there. Close the ventilation in
your helmet.
You know your body, so if it’s too cold, don’t ride. It’s not worth the risk. If
you aren’t comfortable riding in 40-degree weather, don’t do it. But if you’re
comfortable and clear-headed riding in 30-degree weather, go ahead.
Remember, you’re ultimately responsible for your own safety. Sure, there may
be peer pressure to join a midnight winter ride, but don’t do it if you’re not
comfortable. There’s no shame in knowing your limits, and motorcyclists
respect other motorcyclists who consider safety first.
I don’t recommend riding in the snow. But if you feel you must, it’s like riding
in the rain but much, much more slippery. Ride slowly, turn slowly, stop
slowly, and accelerate slowly. To me, the danger isn’t worth it — not only
because of the danger you face controlling your machine but also because of
the difficulties that all the car drivers have controlling theirs. Besides, the
salt and other chemicals that are laid down on the road to melt the ice can
eat up parts on your motorcycle pretty quickly. In my humble opinion: Park
your bike for the winter.
Consider buying an electric vest and gloves to keep you toasty while riding in
cold weather. You can also do what hunters do: Get some disposable heat
packs to stick in your gloves to help keep your hands warm.
Packin’ Up: Carrying Your Gear
A long trip usually means that you need to carry a lot of stuff, including
clothes, rain gear, and maybe a toothbrush. You can’t just throw all your stuff
into a bag or two, strap it on your bike, and take off. Well, you can, but if you
don’t put a little bit of thought into how you carry your stuff, it may end up
falling off the bike during a trip. Worse yet, it can throw off the balance of
your machine, which can make for some interesting riding the first time you
toss your bike into a turn.
If you’re one of those people who can pack everything you need for a week-
long vacation into a carry-on bag, you’re the perfect candidate for a motorcy-
cle trip. But if you need four suitcases and one carry-on when you go to the
Bahamas for a couple of days, you’re going to have to do some serious whit-
tling down of what you take before you hit the road on a bike.
273
Chapter 17: Travel Tips: What You Need to Know from Weather to Luggage

A lot of stuff can be carried on your machine. Just be sure that you pack care-
fully, distribute the luggage on your machine evenly, and don’t exceed the
maximum weight limits that are found on the sidewalls of your tires and the
combined passenger-and-luggage weight limit of your motorcycle, which is
found in your owner’s manual.
Special luggage you may need
If you have a touring bike, you already have some hard luggage built in, either
permanently affixed to the bike or removable so that you can take it into a
hotel room when you stop for the night. But if you don’t have a touring
machine that comes with luggage, you need to decide whether you want to
add luggage to your machine.
Hard luggage
There are companies that make hard luggage, primarily saddlebags, for a vari-
ety of motorcycles (see Figure 17-1 for a look at a hard saddlebag). Adding hard
luggage to your machine can be pricey, but you have the assurance of getting a
quality product and knowing the bags will fit. Many times the luggage is inte-
grated so well that the bike looks like it came from the factory with the bags.
Besides saddlebags, you can get a top box (shown in Figure 17-2) that
attaches to the back of your motorcycle and provides room to carry more
stuff. Many top boxes are big enough to fit a full-face helmet or two.
Figure 17-1:

the price.
274
Part IV: Let’s Ride! 

Soft luggage
If you don’t want to go with hard luggage, soft luggage made of leather or a
synthetic material is the way to go. Check out Figure 17-3, which shows soft
saddlebags. This luggage is much cheaper, and attaching the bags to the bike
is simple. Soft saddlebags come in a variety of sizes to fit everything from
sportbikes to cruisers. Plus, they usually come with rain covers to keep every-
thing dry if it rains. You also can put heavy-duty garbage or trash compactor
bags inside the saddlebags for another layer of protection against the rain.
However, you need to watch out for the following hazards:
 Make sure that the luggage doesn’t touch your exhaust pipe because
synthetic bags can catch on fire or melt.
 Don’t have loose straps flapping around that could get caught in your
rear wheel or drive chain.

275
Chapter 17: Travel Tips: What You Need to Know from Weather to Luggage

If saddlebags don’t give you enough room to carry the things you need, you
can add a tank bag. Tank bags are synthetic and rest on the top of your gas
tank. They’re usually attached with either straps or magnets. You can get
tank bags in various sizes to carry a little or a lot. However, be sure that it
isn’t so big that it gets in the way of your reaching the handlebars. This can
be particularly bothersome on a sportbike, so sportbike riders need to look
for smaller tank bags.
Need to carry even more stuff? You have the following three options:
 You can get bags designed specifically to strap onto the rear seat of
your motorcycle. These bags, commonly called duffel bags (see 
Figure 17-4), give you more carrying capacity, but you need to make 
sure that they’re attached securely and the straps don’t hang down
where they can get caught in your rear wheel.
 You can purchase a backpack made specifically for motorcyclists (see
Figure 17-5). These include padding where the pack meets your back
and crossed straps so that the pack stays snug and secure while you’re
cruising down the road at 50 mph. You don’t want to weigh down a back-
pack with a lot of stuff, though, because the weight on your back can get
tiresome and annoying.
 You can use a courier bag (see Figure 17-6). While they aren’t made for
long trips, courier bags for motorcyclists can be handy if you’re just run-
ning down to the store to pick up a few items.
While soft luggage made for motorcycles comes with the straps you need to
secure the luggage to the bike, it’s always a good idea to have a few extra
straps to help secure things, like that souvenir stuffed fish that you just had
to buy on your trip. Forget those elastic bungee cords that you can buy
almost anywhere. They’re difficult to use on a motorcycle, and usually don’t
keep things snug enough. Buy straps with D-ring cinchers or other secure
connecting hardware.

Part IV: Let’s Ride! 

Suppose you’re on the road and you find a mounted moose head in a store
that would look great in your den. How are you going to fit that on your bike?
You’re not. Take it to the nearest pack-and-ship store and send it home. Keep
that in mind for any items that are too bulky to carry, or even if you just want
to unload some of the stuff that you brought along because you’ve decided
you really won’t need it.
Weight distribution is critical
After you’re ready to load up and hit the open road, you need to give a little
thought to the weight distribution of the stuff on your motorcycle. After all, if
you have all the heavy stuff on the left side of your bike and all the light stuff
on the right side, you may find yourself leaning over as you go down the road,

and taking turns may be quite interesting. Or if you put too much weight on
the rear, your headlight may be pointed toward the sky. You may even have a
skittish front end because it is so light.
Pack your saddlebags so that the right and left bags weigh about the same
amount. Put lighter stuff in your top box, tank bag, and rear seat bag because
those bags ride higher on the bike. You want to keep the weight as low as
possible.
When you load up all your stuff, make sure you don’t exceed the maximum
carrying load that’s stamped on the sidewall of your rear tire. Exceeding that
limit could lead to catastrophic tire failure.
You also may want to adjust the preload on your rear shock — that is, how
much the spring on your shock is compressed with no weight on the bike —
so that it’s compressed more to handle the extra weight in the rear. The
added stiffness will improve the ride. Your owner’s or service manual shows
you how to adjust the preload.
Knowing How to Pack Successfully 
for a Long Trip
You really can carry everything you need for a long trip on your motorcycle.
You just need to be smart about what you pack, and think carefully about
what you really need.
When deciding on what clothes to take, keep in mind that you may run into
different weather along the way, so be prepared for warm- and cold-weather
riding. Think layers, so that you can start out with a T-shirt under your jacket
if the weather is warm but then add another shirt or even a sweater later if
the weather turns cool. And don’t forget to pack your rain gear. Forgetting to
take a rain suit almost guarantees that you’ll get caught in a downpour.
Remember that the towns along your trip route have laundromats. There may
even be a washer and dryer at the hotel where you stay. So don’t think that
you have to take enough clean clothes to last your entire trip.
Choosing the right clothes
Everybody is different, but you really can’t go wrong taking three T-shirts and
a couple pairs of blue jeans for when you’re off the bike, plus maybe four pairs
of underwear and socks for a trip. Add a long-sleeved T-shirt or sweatshirt
278
Part IV: Let’s Ride! 

that you can put on over a T-shirt and some long underwear if you think you
may hit some cold weather, and your motorcycle trip wardrobe is complete.
Going a step further, you need to add a rain suit, rain gloves or rain covers
for your gloves, a couple of bandannas, and a pair of tennis shoes if you don’t
want to walk around in your riding boots at the end of the day. You can also
carry a spare set of gloves in case yours get wet.
It’s a good idea to have a couple small towels or rags to wipe the dew off your
bike in the morning. Hotel managers frown on the use of their towels for that
purpose. Alternatively, you can bring along a light motorcycle cover to pro-
tect your bike overnight. A cover may also make the bike less attractive to
thieves because they won’t know exactly what’s under it — a new machine 
or a 30-year-old junker.
Packing medicines, snacks, and 
other health-related items
The point of a motorcycle trip is to have fun and get away from it all. But 
you don’t want to be 1,500 miles away from home when you discover that you
don’t have some critical item you need. To avoid such a scenario, make sure
you pack the following:
 Medicines: If you take medication regularly, take it with you. And be sure
you have enough to last through your entire trip plus a few extra days.
 Spare glasses: If you wear prescription glasses, take a spare pair. Other-
wise, if you break your glasses, you may be stuck with the hassle and
cost of finding an establishment that can replace them in about an hour.
 Aspirin: Getting a splitting headache in the middle of nowhere is not only
no fun, but it can also be dangerous on a bike.
 Granola bars or energy snacks: Healthy snacks along the way can keep
you feeling well.
 Lip balm, sunglasses, and sunblock: These are good to have on hand
when you’re spending many hours out in the sun.
 Emergency information: Be sure to carry the names and phone numbers
of people who should be called in an emergency, either healthwise or in
case of a crash. A lot of people wear dog tags with their name, phone
number, and an emergency contact. Also be sure to note whether you’re
allergic to any medicines.
 A first-aid kit: A small first-aid kit helps to cover unforeseen 
contingencies.
279
Chapter 17: Travel Tips: What You Need to Know from Weather to Luggage

Taking the necessities
Here are few last-minute (but important) items that you may want to have
with you when you’re traveling by bike:
 A cellphone: A cellphone can get you out of a jam or make it easier to
make a hotel room reservation, so it’s a good idea to carry one along. In
fact, you generally get a better room rate if you call a hotel and make a
reservation than if you walk in and ask for a room. If you don’t have a
cellphone, a telephone calling card can enable you to call someone to
get out of a jam.
 A tire-repair kit: Know how to use this kit if you bring one. Practice on
an old tire before you take your long ride. Also, be sure to take a tire
pressure gauge.
 A flashlight: This item is critical if you have to check things out on your
bike or fix a flat tire in the dark.
 Fuses: You should have extra fuses on hand, just in case.
 An extra bike key: What would you do if you lost your bike key a thou-
sand miles from home? Well, it would be no problem if you kept a spare
key in your wallet or hidden on your bike. Also, consider taking a disc
lock or padlock to secure your machine when you settle into a hotel or
tent for the night. And be sure your license and registration are up-to-date.
 A siphon hose: This hose is useful if you run out of gas and another
motorcyclist stops to help you out.
 Hand wipes: These are always useful to help keep you feeling fresh.
 A weather radio: Check the radio from time to time to be sure that you
aren’t riding into a nasty storm.
 A small cable lock: If you plan to do some walking on your trip, such as
visiting a museum, you may want to bring along a small cable lock that
you can thread through the sleeve of your riding jacket and helmet to
secure them to your bike. That way you don’t need to carry them
around.
Before you make your trip, do a detailed preride inspection of your machine.
I cover how to do a preride inspection in Chapter 13. Consider the length of
the trip and whether you should get new tires or perform an oil change
before you go.

chunks. For instance, I introduce some cool stuff, such
as the top-ten great biker events and valuable motorcy-
cling organizations you can consider joining. And because
motorcycling is full of colorful characters and people who
have made important contributions to the sport, I give
thumbnail sketches of the ten most important folks. I also

serious documentaries to drive-in movies. Enjoy!

Chapter 18
Ten (Plus One) Can’t-Miss Events
In This Chapter
 Discovering different motorcycling events
 Finding out why each event is so special
I
n the motorcycling world, certain events are so well known that you can
just mention their names and everyone knows exactly what you’re talking
about. They’re also the events that, inevitably, someone is going to ask if
you’ve ever been to. It can be pretty embarrassing to admit that you have
never been to at least one of these top events. If you go to one and don’t like
it (which is doubtful), at least you have the motorcycling cred to last you a
lifetime.
While motorcyclists of all different stripes go to these events, some are known
as “biker” gatherings, and others appeal more to the sportbike or touring
crowd. After you’ve decided what kind of motorcycle you want to ride and
what motorcycling lifestyle you want to pursue, it’s pretty easy to decide what
events you really want to attend. (Turn to Chapter 4 for more on choosing a
bike that fits you and your lifestyle.)
No matter what event or events you decide to attend this year, as a motor-
cyclist you’re guaranteed to enjoy the camaraderie and have a ball. In fact,
plan your trip now because hotel rooms can fill up fast — sometimes six
months to almost a year before the event. And in some places, expect to 
pay a premium for a hotel room during the event.
Daytona Bike Week
Usually held in late-February to early-March in Daytona Beach, Florida,
Daytona Bike Week has actually grown into “Daytona 10 days.” It’s impossible
to cram all the Daytona events into one little week. In fact, Daytona Bike Week,
which has a rich history dating back to January 1937, has truly proven its
status as one giant party with 500,000 of your closest motorcycling friends.

Daytona, which is the shorthand name that motorcyclists use for this event,
has it all. It’s best known for attracting older cruiser riders, but more and
more younger sportbike riders are beginning to show up as a result of its
wide offerings of fun.
Each day of Daytona Bike Week is chock-full of events. You’ll find everything
from custom bike shows and bikini-clad ladies wrestling in cole slaw to self-
guided rides around the Florida countryside. You’ll also find new bike displays
by the motorcycle makers and charity fundraising rides. Main Street is the
place to be if you want to watch the custom motorcycles of event-goers roll by.
And if you need to buy anything at all related to motorcycling, the vendors at
Daytona Bike Week probably have it. And don’t forget to get yourself a tattoo!
The crown-jewel event of the many activities going on during Bike Week is the
Daytona 200 motorcycle race, where the top professional roadracers in the
nation battle handlebar-to-handlebar at close to 200 mph on the famed high-
banked Daytona International Speedway asphalt track. The racing is exciting,
especially when riders make last-second passes just before the finish line to
win the race by milliseconds (which has actually happened in several recent
races).
A round of the AMA Supercross Series also takes place at Daytona International
Speedway during Bike Week. This highly anticipated event always makes for
great racing. The factory teams pull out all the stops to try to win this presti-
gious event and demoralize the competition to gain momentum for the rest of
the season. And then, of course, there’s the professional dirt-track racing and
the variety of amateur racing events, both roadracing and off-roadracing.
For the hard-core motorcyclist, Daytona Bike Week has it all. Check out the
official Daytona Bike Week Web site for even more information about events
and accommodations (www.daytonachamber.com/enbw/bwhomenew3.
htm).
In the eyes of your fellow motorcyclists, you get extra credibility points if you
ride your bike to Daytona from the frozen northern states such as Michigan,
Massachusetts, or New York. If you make that icy trek, you’re guaranteed to
have a story to tell about your trip.
Biketoberfest
Biketoberfest, a smaller version of Daytona Bike Week, is held in October in
Daytona Beach, Florida. While Biketoberfest isn’t as huge as Daytona Bike
Week, it’s gaining in popularity because some riders just don’t want to deal
with the massive Daytona Bike Week crowd. You can consider Biketoberfest
“Daytona Bike Week Lite.”
284
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Even though Biketoberfest lasts only four days and doesn’t have professional
racing, it still offers the custom motorcycles, vendors, cole-slaw wrestling,
and other events that hard-core bikers have come to know and love. Attending
Biketoberfest is a great way to cap the riding season for motorcyclists in
states where they’ll have to soon put away their bikes for the winter. Go to
www.biketoberfest.org for dates and other information.
Sturgis Motorcycle Rally
Like Daytona Bike Week, the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, held in Sturgis, South
Dakota, has a long history. The seven-day event, which is traditionally held in
early August, began in 1938. While Sturgis is ground zero for the festivities,
the event has grown so big that Sturgis Motorcycle Rally activities are also
held in nearby cities.
The Sturgis Motorcycle Rally is like Daytona Bike Week with its cole-slaw
wrestling, custom bikes, hundreds of vendors, and bike-watching on the main
drag through town. Daytona Bike Week trumps Sturgis with professional racing,
but Sturgis outdoes Daytona on the party scene with a number of concerts per-
formed by well-known rock and roll bands.
The Sturgis area also offers some great riding and easy trips to historic sites,
such as Mount Rushmore. Even though more and more sportbikes are show-
ing up at Daytona Bike Week, there are still very few at Sturgis. Sturgis is
heaven for the cruiser crowd, particularly those on Harley-Davidsons. 
You can get more information on the event at www.sturgismotorcycle
rally.com.
Laconia Motorcycle Week
Laconia Motorcycle Week is held in Laconia, New Hampshire, in mid-June.
This nine-day mega-event is another favorite of the Harley-Davidson and
cruiser crowd. The event made its debut in 1923. Along with Daytona and
Sturgis, Laconia holds a spot in the top three most famous motorcycling
events in the country.
Custom bike shows, self-guided rides, vendors, demonstration rides by the
major motorcycle manufacturers, and all the other standard fare of a week of
motorcycling nirvana is on tap at Laconia. Several types of amateur racing
are also standard at this event. You’ll also find tattoo contests and motorcycle
riding skills competitions. Visit www.laconiamcweek.com/index.htm for
more information.

Chapter 18: Ten (Plus One) Can’t-Miss Events

MotoGP at Laguna Seca
Let’s face it, car racing is for wimps. If you want to see real racing action, you
have to see Superbikes and MotoGP bikes screaming around asphalt tracks at
speeds of up to 200 mph. While the Daytona 200 is the granddaddy of American
Superbike racing, Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca in Monterey, California, is the
location for races featuring international stars. These are the best motorcycle
roadracers on the planet. This is one of two American rounds of the interna-
tional MotoGP Championship. The second is in Indianapolis, Indiana, which I
discuss later in this chapter.
Called the Red Bull U.S. Grand Prix, the Laguna Seca race features specially
built racing motorcycles that spend most of their time racing the MotoGP cir-
cuit in Europe and a few other places around the world. MotoGP is an interna-
tional motorcycle racing championship, and the top riders make millions of
dollars a year. America’s Nicky Hayden, known as “The Kentucky Kid,” was
the 2006 MotoGP world champion. The 800cc MotoGP bikes have top speeds
of about 208 mph, their engines produce about 220 horsepower, and they
weigh just 326 pounds.
There are a few Americans battling in the MotoGP championship, and the
large crowd at Laguna Seca is always rooting for one of the U.S. riders to win
the race on their home turf. The Americans have the advantage on the tech-
nical 2-mile-plus Laguna Seca track because they’ve ridden it for years on
Superbikes before making the move to MotoGP. But the Europeans have
raced at Laguna Seca for several years now and have figured out the track,
and that means they’re starting to win the race. The track is famed for its
corkscrew, which is a quick left and then right turn going down a steep down-
hill. What makes the corkscrew so tricky is that the racer is speeding up a
long straightaway with a slight curve in it heading into the corkscrew, and the
entrance to the corkscrew is blind.
MotoGP races in Europe attract up to 180,000 spectators. While MotoGP
racing hasn’t gained that much popularity in the United States, Laguna Seca
still attracts tens of thousands of spectators. The race, which is held in July,
has a festival atmosphere with skydivers dropping onto the track, stunt-plane
fliers, and other types of nonmotorcycling entertainment. Plus you’ll see lots
of vendors selling everything the high-performance motorcyclist needs —
from one-piece leather racing suits to top-of-the-line helmets to gloves with
the best protection you can get. The race definitely attracts the sportbike
crowd. And what’s great about Laguna Seca is that it’s a spectator-friendly
racetrack — it’s easy to find a great place to sit and watch the race.
The rare opportunity to see the world’s best roadracers in action is reason
enough to go to Laguna Seca. But wait, there’s more! A few American racers
are allowed to test their skills against the MotoGP regulars in the race, giving
American fans even more racers to cheer for. And the MotoGP is packaged
286
Part V: The Part of Tens 

with an AMA Superbike race at the same track that same weekend, meaning
spectators can watch America’s best racers in action as well. It’s a race week-
end that many motorcyclists try to attend each year.
Plus, the after-race activities at night in nearby downtown Monterey, California,
particularly the Cannery district, is great. Sportbikes line the streets at night
and make for some great viewing. And it’s always fun to chat with the owners.
You can find out more about the Red Bull U.S. Grand Prix at www.redbullus
grandprix.com/#s=home.
MotoGP at Indianapolis
The Red Bull Indianapolis GP in Indiana, first scheduled in September 2008,
gives race fans in the Midwest a chance to see the best roadracers in the
world. Did you know that the first race ever held at the Indianapolis Motor
Speedway was a motorcycle race? The race will be neutral ground for all the
MotoGP riders because none of them has ever ridden on the track. To accom-
modate the motorcycle race, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway built a new
2.6-mile road course. This is the second of two American rounds of the
International MotoGP Championship, with the other being at Mazda Raceway
Laguna Seca in Monterey, California.
While the Red Bull Indianapolis GP won’t feature AMA Superbike racing like
Laguna Seca does, it will have something that will give American fans a true
taste of what MotoGP racing is like in other parts of the world: a 250cc class
and 125cc class as well as the premier MotoGP 800cc class, just like at all the
MotoGP races around the world except Laguna Seca. Visit www.redbull
indianapolisgp.com for more information on this MotoGP event.
Americade
Harley-Davidson and cruiser riders have their Daytona Bike Week, Sturgis
Motorcycle Rally, and Laconia Motorcycle Week, but touring riders have
Americade, which is held in June. This massive five-day event held in Lake
George, New York, attracts more than 50,000 motorcyclists. While most of
them are touring riders, you’ll also find people on sport-touring machines
and cruisers. All riders are welcome. Note that the event organizers don’t 
like loud pipes on bikes, and neither do most of the participants.
What makes Americade so popular? Besides the large number of events,
Americade is a wholesome rally that you wouldn’t be embarrassed to tell
your parents about. You won’t find burn-out contests or bikini-clad women
287
Chapter 18: Ten (Plus One) Can’t-Miss Events

cole-slaw wrestling here. Activities include guided and self-guided riding tours
in upstate New York, boat cruises, dinners, a rodeo, charity rides, fashion
shows, motorcycling-related seminars, trade shows, and more than $100,000
in door prizes. Check out www.tourexpo.com/data/mos/Frontpage/
Itemid,1 for more details.
Honda Hoot
The Honda Hoot is a four-day event that’s held in June in Knoxville, Tennessee,
and, like Americade, it has a true family flavor. It’s called the Honda Hoot and
is put on by the American Honda Motor Company, but all brands and types of
motorcycles are welcome. The Honda Hoot is a favorite of the touring and
sport-touring crowd.
The event features scenic rides, riding demonstrations, movies, a riverboat
cruise, bike shows, motorcycle test rides, vendors, an ice cream social, a fish
fry, and more. Plus, there’s great riding in the area, as I mention when I dis-
cuss Deal’s Gap in Chapter 16. To find out dates and other information, visit
www.hondahoot.com/index.aspx?bhcp=1.
Golden Aspen Rally
The Golden Aspen Rally, held for four days in mid-September in Ruidoso, New
Mexico, is a friendly rally like Americade and the Honda Hoot. This rally is
primarily for tourers but welcomes all motorcyclists. Events include a trade
show, rider safety training, field events, a parade, area riding, and even the
crowning of a king and queen. Go to www.motorcyclerally.com for more
information.
The Springfield Mile
Dirt-track racing is a true American sport, and it was invented in the United
States with racers on specially built motorcycles battling on a dirt oval. The
Springfield Mile, held on a mile-long dirt oval at the Illinois State Fairgrounds
in Springfield, Illinois, on Labor Day weekend, is considered one of the most
famous races on the AMA Flat Track Championship circuit.
Speeds average 100 mph on the track, and racers slide their machines around
the corners handlebar to handlebar with one foot on the track. Racers wear a
specially made steel sole that straps on their racing boot so they can keep 
a foot down on the track. With the roar of the engines (most of the race
288
Part V: The Part of Tens 

machines are Harley-Davidsons) and the close racing, the Springfield Mile is 
a spectacle. And it’s a favorite among Harley-Davidson riders. For more infor-
mation, go to the Web site of the promoter, the Illinois Motorcycle Dealers
Association, at www.illinoismda.com, or to the AMA Web site at www.
amaflattrack.com.
Supercross
Some 17 rounds of the AMA Supercross Series are held around the nation each
year, beginning in January in Anaheim, California, and wrapping up in May in
Las Vegas. Supercross is racing on a dirt course that features high jumps, tight
turns, and rows of small hills that racers stutter over. The Supercross track is
built in a stadium using tons of dirt.
Supercross attracts the younger set, and, in fact, probably a lot of the people
who attend Supercross events probably don’t even ride dirt bikes. Motor-
cyclists and nonmotorcyclists alike can appreciate the skill it takes for these
riders to navigate the tight Supercross track at speed. The whole Supercross
experience is like attending a rock concert. It’s complete with loud music,
bright lights, and plenty of excitement. After you attend one Supercross race,
you’re hooked and will always want to go back for more. For schedules and
other information, visit www.amamotocross.com.

Ten Great Motorcycling Groups
In This Chapter
 Looking at motorcycling groups you can join
 Reviewing what makes each organization special
T
here’s a lot of fun and excitement in motorcycling, but it’s even more fun
when you can share the excitement with like-minded riders. By joining an
organization, you find out about events to attend that are related to your par-
ticular style of riding, you have knowledgeable people to turn to when you
need technical help with your bike, and you have an enthusiastic group of
guys and gals you can pal around with who are always happy to see you.
You should also consider joining other organizations that are for the good of
the whole of motorcycling now and in the future. These are groups dedicated
to protecting the rights of motorcyclists, keeping roads and trails open to
motorcycles, and fighting discrimination against motorcyclists.
It’s good to be a member of one group, and great to be a member of several.
This chapter gives you a look at some of the best motorcycling organizations
in the country.
The American Motorcyclist Association
The American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) is the one do-it-all motor-
cycling organization in the United States. Whether you’re concerned about
protecting your rights as a rider, you want to discover great places to ride, 
or you want to race, you need to be a member of the AMA. The AMA was
formed in 1924 and now boasts more than 280,000 members. It’s the largest
motorcyclists’ organization in the world.
The AMA has a strong government relations department that tackles issues
important to motorcyclists, such as bike bans, land closures, and discrimina-
tion against motorcyclists. Motorcyclist discrimination involves such things
as health insurance policies that don’t pay for the treatment of injuries sus-
tained in a motorcycle crash — even though those same policies will pay for
injuries suffered by someone who crashes while driving a car drunk. (I cover
insurance in more detail in Chapter 10.)

To satisfy your passion for riding, the AMA can point you to hundreds of AMA-
sanctioned rallies and riding events each year. The organization has arranged
for discounts for AMA members for all sorts of stuff ranging from motorcycle
insurance to bike parts. And the organization produces a monthly magazine
called American Motorcyclist, one of the largest in the nation, which covers
the many facets of motorcycling.
The organization also oversees amateur and professional racing across the
country. If you’ve seen a motorcycle race, it was probably sanctioned by 
the AMA. If you want to get involved in amateur racing or hope to one day
become a pro, the AMA can show you how. To find out more about the AMA,
visit www.amadirectlink.com.
The BlueRibbon Coalition
The BlueRibbon Coalition, formed in 1987, is a national organization that’s
best known for protecting the rights of dirt bike riders. But the group is also
involved in other things, such as promoting the responsible use of public land
by off-road riders, educating land-use decision makers about the need for
recreational trails, and educating the news media about motorized recreation.
Check out www.sharetrails.org for more information about this coalition
and issues affecting motorcyclists. At the coalition’s Web site, you can also
find out the status of some of the major legal fights involving motorcyclists
around the country.
The BMW Motorcycle Owners of America
The BMW Motorcycle Owners of America, or BMWOA, is a social club for
BMW owners that was formed in 1972. This social club, which has more than
37,000 members, holds an international rally each year in the United States 
or Canada. This rally attracts more than 7,000 riders. The organization’s local
clubs also hold smaller rallies around the country. Like all social clubs, the
BMWOA promotes camaraderie and friendship. It also offers information on
touring overseas. You can find out more about events and membership at
www.bmwmoa.org.
The Gold Wing Road Riders Association
The Gold Wing Road Riders Association, known as GWRRA, was formed in
1977 and is for the touring set. It’s made up mainly of Honda Gold Wing
riders. (See Chapter 4 for a description of the Gold Wing.) With more than
292
Part V: The Part of Tens 

80,000 members worldwide, the club promotes rider safety training, cama-
raderie among motorcyclists of all stripes, a positive image of motorcycling,
and, of course, fun.
And I mean it when I say that club members do have fun. The GWRRA, for
instance, sponsors rallies of various sizes around the nation. The crown jewel
is the organization’s annual national rally called the Wing Ding, which attracts
around 10,000 riders and is held around July 4 at various places in the country.
Most of the organization’s rallies include bike shows, skill events, seminars,
vendors, and, of course, rides. Find out more about membership and events
at www.gwrra.org.
The Harley Owners Group
The Harley-Davidson Motor Company established the Harley Owners Group,
or H.O.G., in 1983, and it now boasts more than a million members world-
wide. This is definitely the social club for the Harley-Davidson crowd. Like
other social clubs, H.O.G. sponsors local and national rallies. It also holds
what it calls “touring rallies,” in which Harley-Davidson riders ride from town
to town.
The group’s rallies usually feature live bands, bike shows, parades, skill games,
and more. The touring rallies usually take place over several days as riders
ride to various destinations, and they don’t usually involve the humongous
crowds that can be found at national and state rallies. Visit www.harley-
davidson.com for more information.
The Honda Sport Touring Association
With a reputation for being the club for riders who truly like to get out and do
some riding, the Honda Sport Touring Association, or HSTA, welcomes riders
on all brands of motorcycles. The organization sponsors more than a dozen
rallies around the country and they do a lot of riding. These rallies include
rider safety training, campouts, and even some off-road rides.
Founded in 1982, the HSTA is a social club dedicated to promoting cama-
raderie among bikers and learning about motorcycling. The riders in this
group are a little more spirited than those in some other groups, meaning
they like to ride a little faster and tackle roads that are a lot twistier than
riders in some other groups. The association has strong ties to the American
Honda Motor Co. For more information on the HSTA, visit
www.ridehsta.com.
293
Chapter 19: Ten Great Motorcycling Groups

The National Off-Highway Vehicle
Conservation Council
The National Off-Highway Vehicle Conservation Council, known as NOHVCC,
is an off-highway group dedicated to protecting the rights of off-road riders
and to promoting safe and responsible riding. The group has representatives
in each state to provide information to riders, associations, government offi-
cials, and politicians in order to promote responsible motorized recreation.
Check out www.nohvcc.org for more information.
The Riders of Kawasaki Club
The Riders of Kawasaki Club, also known as ROK, is a Kawasaki factory-
sponsored club for riders of all styles of Kawasaki streetbikes. Riders of 
other brands of machines are also welcome. This social organization, which
began in 1991, promotes friendship and good times. You can find out more at
www.kawasaki.com.
The Riders Association of Triumph
The Riders Association of Triumph, or R.A.T., is the official factory-sponsored
riding club for Triumph owners. This social organization puts together rides,
track days to practice your skills at roadrace courses, and more. Visit www.
triumph.co.uk/usa for more information on membership and events.
The STAR Touring & Riding Association
With more than 40,000 members, the STAR Touring & Riding Association is
the official riding organization of Star motorcycles. This cruiser organization
bills itself as a family organization that welcomes riders on all makes of
machines. It stresses a family atmosphere at its gatherings. For example,
there are games for kids to play and no scantily clad women walking around.
STAR rides and rallies are held throughout the United States, and the national
rally is called STAR Days, which features bike shows, vendors, rides, and tons
of fun. Find out more at www.startouring.org.

Ten Great People in Motorcycling
In This Chapter
 Reviewing motorcycling legends
 Looking at the accomplishments that make these motorcyclists great
M
illions of motorcyclists are on the road today, and millions have been
on the road since the beginning of motorcycling in the late 1800s. These
motorcyclists range from the guy you’re sure to run into at a motorcycling
rally wearing a furry helmet with Viking horns, to the women who have made
their marks in professional motorcycle racing, to the designers and engineers
who have tomorrow’s motorcycles in their heads today.
Out of this mix of millions of riders with different skills and accomplishments
riding various machines, how many are true legends? Lots. Here, I’ve picked
ten folks who I believe deserve the honor. Bring up these names in discus-
sions with motorcyclists and some will agree with the list and some won’t,
sparking a spirited debated about motorcycling (which, of course, is some-
thing that motorcyclists enjoy).
However, many other people won’t have a clue who these people are. That’s
okay, too. After all, those who know some of the names will be impressed by
how knowledgeable you are, and those who don’t know these legends will be
interested in hearing about them. And by reading about these legends, you’ll
get a feel for how truly special, and diverse, motorcycling is.
Giacomo “Ago” Agostini
Giacomo “Ago” Agostini is revered as one on the greatest motorcycle road-
racers of all time, and it’s easy to see why. This Italian racer, who was on the
world roadracing scene from 1964 to 1976, won races, races, and more races.
A world grand prix racer riding the most exotic machines against the best
racers on the planet, Ago had some classic battles against Britain’s Mike “The
Bike” Hailwood, who also is considered one of the greatest racers of all time.
In fact, Ago just narrowly won the 1966 and 1967 world 500cc grand prix
championships, edging out Hailwood.

Ago rode for the MV Agusta factory team most of his career, but then he
moved to Yamaha in 1974. That year, he won the Daytona 200 as he raced
against international and American motorcycle racing stars.
When his career ended in 1976, Ago had won 122 grand prix races. He earned
15 world grand prix titles and 12 titles at the famed Isle of Man race in Britain.
He then became a grand prix team manager.
Erwin “Cannonball” Baker
Erwin “Cannonball” Baker is known for making some incredible transcontinen-
tal rides at speed back when motorcycling was still relatively new, men were
men, and cross-country highways didn’t exist. His record-setting runs were the
stuff of legend.
In 1908, at the age 26, Cannonball began winning local races aboard an
American-made Indian. In 1909, he won the very first race ever held at the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway. But he’s best known as an endurance racer,
making long distance runs from town to town racing trains and setting
records for crossing the United States. He also set endurance records 
overseas.
Cannonball, who got his nickname from a newspaper reporter who compared
him to the Cannonball Express train, died in 1960.
Erik Buell
Erik Buell is a motorcyclist who made his dreams come true. He left the
Harley-Davidson Motor Company to form his own American motorcycling
firm, which Harley-Davidson eventually bought.
A motorcycle roadracer, Buell worked at Harley-Davidson as a chassis designer
when he decided to head out on his own in 1982 to build racing machines. His
dream quickly hit a roadblock when the American Motorcyclist Association,
which sets the rules and sanctions professional motorcycle racing in America,
eliminated the racing class that Buell built his bikes for. This wrinkle called for
a new plan.
Capitalizing on his expertise as a chassis designer, Buell decided to make
sportbikes using Harley-Davidson motors. He built his first Buell RR1000 in
1985, and then he built sportbikes with bigger motors starting in 1988. Buells
gained a reputation as great-handling, American sportbikes. The Harley-
Davidson Motor Company bought Buell Motorcycles in 2003, and Buell him-
self still heads the company.

William G. Davidson
Yep, William G. Davidson, or Willie G., as he’s affectionately known to millions
of motorcyclists around the world, is a member of that Davidson family. He’s
the grandson of William A. Davidson who, along with his brothers Arthur and
Walter, and William Harley, formed the Harley-Davidson Motor Company in
1903. But Willie G.’s lineage isn’t what elevates him to god-like status among
Harley-Davidson riders; it’s what he has done at the Harley-Davidson Motor
Company that has earned him the respect of all motorcyclists — and not just
Harley-Davidson fans.
Willie G. joined the Harley-Davidson design team in 1963 and rose to be the
head of the styling department. He’s credited with taking some risks at
Harley-Davidson that have moved the company forward with new designs.
For example, Willie G. saw what was happening in the motorcycling world in
the late 1960s when riders were buying Harleys and then customizing them
into choppers. Willie G. decided that it was time to give riders an opportunity
to get a custom bike straight from the factory.
The result? The 1971 Super Glide, which essentially was the company’s
Electra Glide with a chopper, or extended, front end. He also designed an
integrated, fiberglass seat and tail section, splashed on some bright colors,
and rolled out a new bike with styling unlike anything anyone had ever seen
from Harley-Davidson.
Unfortunately, sales of the new Super Glide were, well, less than stellar. It
seemed that the integrated seat and tail wasn’t the look Harley riders wanted.
But riders did like the low, lean aspects of this 74 cubic-inch (1,208cc), 560-
pound cruiser. So when Harley-Davidson decided to drop-kick the seat-tail
section in favor of a more conventional seat and rear fender, sales picked up.
The Super Glide quickly became a favorite among riders. In fact, the Super
Glide is still popular today. It is generally accepted as the first factory custom,
a motorcycle built by the factory to appeal to the crowd that would normally
buy a custom. The Japanese manufacturers later followed suit.
Willie G. is obviously well known for his styling efforts, but newer riders may
not know the critical role he played in preventing the demise of the Harley-
Davidson Motor Company. In the early 1970s, he and a dozen other 
Harley-Davidson executives joined together and bought the ailing company
from owner AMF (the guys who make bowling equipment) just when it looked
like Harley-Davidson might be forced into bankruptcy. Under the guidance of
Willie G. and the other executives, the Harley-Davidson Motor Company was
saved and has become a successful, profitable company.
Watch for Willie G. and his trademark beret at big Harley-Davidson rallies
around the nation. He enjoys attending rallies and hanging around with riders.
He’s the most visible, and most recognizable, face of Harley-Davidson today.

Dick “Bugsy” Mann
A few motorcycle racers weren’t happy doing just one type of racing over the
span of their careers. These racers did whatever kind of racing they could,
whenever they could. Few excelled in the various disciplines. But Dick
“Bugsy” Mann did.
During his long professional racing career, which stretched from 1959 to 1974,
Bugsy competed in dirt track, motocross, and roadracing championships. One
of his biggest victories came in 1970 when, after 15 years of trying, he won the
Daytona 200 roadrace. He won aboard a Honda 750, showing that the Japanese
factories were up to the task of building premier race-winning machines.
On the dirt-track scene, he won his first professional race in Peoria, Illinois, in
1959. He won his first dirt-track championship in 1963 and his second in 1971.
Bugsy also successfully raced in the then-fledgling sport of motocross profes-
sionally in the 1960s and 1970s. He retired from professional racing in 1974,
and represented the United States on the International Six Day Trial team
overseas in 1975.
In the old days, racers were also their own mechanics, and Bugsy became
famous for wearing straw hats while working on his bikes. These hats were
inexpensive and could be picked up just about anywhere, because they 
were popularly worn by women while they did gardening.
Jeremy “Showtime” McGrath
Jeremy “Showtime” McGrath is certainly one of the greatest Supercross racers
of all time. He brought showmanship to the sport in the 1990s that wowed not
only motorcycle enthusiasts but the general public as well. Crowds were pack-
ing stadiums across the nation to see the country’s best Supercross racers in
action, especially McGrath.
Before getting into Supercross, which involves racing on small tracks with tight
turns and high jumps, McGrath raced BMX bicycles. One day he decided to
bring some of his BMX tricks to the motorcycle scene. He invented the Nac
Nac, a trick where he takes a jump and then hangs off the side of the bike
while high in the air. McGrath’s antics aboard his bike helped create a sport
now known as freestyle motocross, in which competitors don’t race, but
instead do tricks on motocross machines.
McGrath began his professional Supercross career in 1989 and went on to
become the winningest Supercross rider in the history of the sport, with 
72 wins. He earned seven Supercross titles before retiring in 2003. Although
retired, he still does test riding for Honda.
298
Part V: The Part of Tens 

He also raced as part of the American Motocross of Nations team in 1993 and
1996. As a part of this team, McGrath competed in Motocross against other
teams from around the world on outdoor natural terrain tracks. Those tracks
are much longer than Supercross tracks but with the same challenging turns
and jumps. The American team won both those years.
“King” Kenny Roberts
You can’t be a sportbike or motorcycle racing enthusiast and not know the
name “King” Kenny Roberts. This motorcycle roadracer from Modesto,
California, raced in the United States before heading off to Europe to show
the European riders and fans, who at that time sneered at American road-
racers, that they could get beat by American upstarts. Roberts wasn’t afraid
of risks.
Roberts began his professional racing career at the age of 16 on American
dirt tracks, sliding his racing machines around corners handlebar to handle-
bar with the best racers in the nation. Remarkably, he won the very first race
he entered as a professional in 1972. And he won the national No. 1 plates in
1973 and 1974. Roberts is probably best remembered as a dirt-track racer,
though, and for racing a machine that had a Yamaha TZ750 roadacing motor
stuffed in a dirt-track race bike frame in 1975. Most riders in his day were on
Harley-Davidson motorcycles.
Roberts showed up with his unique bike for the race at the Indy Mile in
Indianapolis in 1975. While the Harley-Davidson bikes probably topped out 
at around 120 mph on the long straights at the Indy Mile, Kenny’s bike could
hit 150 mph. He truly had a dirt-track weapon. The only problem was that 
he had a difficult time controlling the power of the monster Yamaha motor.
Traction in the corners is the name of the game on dirt tracks, and it took all
of Kenny’s skill to keep the rear wheel of his machine from spinning so that
he could maintain traction.
Roberts rode the bucking beast in the main event and found himself in fourth
place in the last corner on the last lap. Somehow, he managed to get by the
leading trio of Harley-Davidsons with just feet to spare at the finish line. It’s
considered one of the greatest achievements in American racing history.
Besides riding dirt track, Roberts was also a roadracer. He won the American
Formula One roadracing title in 1977, and then he set off to challenge Europe’s
best roadracers in 1978 in the world championships. He stunned the
European roadracing world in 1978 by winning the FIM World 500cc Grand
Prix Championship in his rookie season, making him the first American to
ever win the 500cc World title. He went on to win the No. 1 plate again in 1979
and 1980.
299
Chapter 20: Ten Great People in Motorcycling

After the 1983 season Roberts retired as a racer. He has been running his own
World 500cc Championship teams ever since.
Malcolm Smith
A great off-road rider, Malcolm Smith came to national prominence with the
release of the 1971 feature film documentary On Any Sunday. This documen-
tary examined motorcycle racing in America, and Smith was one of the fea-
tured racers. Probably the most memorable scene in the movie shows Smith,
actor Steve McQueen, and dirt-track racer Mert Lawill having a ball while
riding dirt bikes on a beach near the ocean.
In the early days of his racing career, Smith rode a 1953 matchless and then
later a Greeves machine in hare scrambles races (which involved two-hour
races over rugged terrain). Smith likes to tell the story about how Edison
Dye, who promoted and built up in America the European sport of motocross,
approached him in 1966 and asked him to race a Swedish machine that he
was importing — the Husqvarna.
Smith was skeptical, but Dye told him if he liked the machine he would send
Smith to the prestigious International Six Day Trails in Sweden. Smith liked
the machine, and so he went to Sweden where he earned a silver medal. He
attended the International Six Day Trials the next year in Poland and earned 
a gold medal. Over the years, he earned a total of eight gold medals.
Smith is also well known for his great racing in the Baja 1000, a 1,000-mile race
in Mexico. Off-road riding gear called “MSR” is made by the company he
founded, Malcolm Smith Racing.
Bessie Stringfield
Bessie Stringfield was a strong woman, and she rode a motorcycle back when
women just didn’t do that. During her 60 years of riding, she didn’t just ride
around town either; she made cross-country treks alone at a time when it was
rare for a woman to do so — and downright dangerous for an African-American
to do it. She died in 1993 at the age of 82.
Stringfield was 16 when she rode her first bike. During her riding career, she
rode in every state in the mainland United States, and served during World
War II as a civilian motorcycle dispatch rider. She also raced flat track, and
won, disguised as a man. She became known as the “Motorcycling Queen of
Miami.”

Theresa Wallach
An early motorcycling pioneer, Theresa Wallach is probably best known for
her grueling trek across Africa in the 1930s. But she also was involved in
other aspects of motorcycling; she served, for example, as a military dis-
patch rider, mechanic, and safety-school instructor.
Born in 1909 in London, England, Wallach rode and raced motorcycles as a
young lady. In 1935, she and friend Florence Blenkiron loaded up a motorcy-
cle equipped with a sidecar and trailer and set off on an incredible journey
from London to Capetown, South Africa. Imagine crossing the Sahara with no
roads and all the dangers. Wallach and her friend did it, earning respect from
the British motorcycling community.
She served in the British army as a mechanic and motorcycle dispatch 
rider. She also toured the United States, Canada, and Mexico, moving to live
in the U.S. in 1952. While in the U.S., she started a motorcycle safety training
school. Wallach rode until she was 88, and died in 1999 on her 90th birthday.

Ten Must-See Motorcycling
Movies
In This Chapter
 Exploring motorcycling through the movies
 Getting to know some of the best and worst biker movies
F
ilmmakers had a fascination with bikers from the early 1950s to the late
1960s, and even beyond. But, as you can imagine, filmmakers weren’t
interested in making documentaries about the motorcycling lifestyle. Nope.
They were interested in making movies that would make cash.
It’s no surprise then that a lot of the biker movies made in the 1950s and
1960s followed popular Western movie formulas, including good versus evil,
barroom brawls, love interests, and rivaling gangs. These movies made for
entertainment even though they didn’t exactly match reality.
In this chapter, I clue you in on some of these fabulously entertaining motor-
cycle movies. So rent a few, grab the popcorn, turn down the lights, and have
a ball.
The Wild One (1954)
Considered by most to be the movie that started the wave of motorcycle
gang movies out of Hollywood, The Wild One stars Marlon Brando and Lee
Marvin as rival gang leaders. The movie portrays bike gangs as young hood-
lums rebelling against society. They just wanted to ride, fight, and party. This
is the theme of most of the biker movies to follow. However, this movie is
actually quite tame compared to the later biker movies.
This movie is based on a real-life incident shortly after World War II; this inci-
dent was actually blown out of proportion by the news media. It was a gather-
ing of about 4,000 motorcyclists in Hollister, California, in 1947. Some of the

motorcyclists rode their bikes into bars, a few were drunk in the streets, and
the media reported that bikers terrorized the town. I discuss the so-called
Hollister riot in Chapter 2.
The Wild Angels (1966)
With stars like Peter Fonda, Nancy Sinatra, and Bruce Dern, what more could
you want in a movie? In The Wild Angels, Fonda is named Heavenly Blues; his
devoted girlfriend, Sinatra, is named Mike; and Dern is called Loser. Together
Blues and Loser lead an attack on another gang. During the melee, Loser
steals a motorcycle cop’s bike and ends up getting hurt and going to the hos-
pital (and his buds decide to bust him out). The gang ransacks a church and
fights in a cemetery. These dudes have no morals and are just plain mean. At
a funeral, Heavenly Blues says, “We want to be free to ride our machines with-
out being hassled by The Man,” which has become one of the most famous
movie lines in motorcycling.
Hell’s Angels on Wheels (1967)
In Hell’s Angels on Wheels, Jack Nicholson is a gas station attendant who gets
into a spat with a customer and, as a result, loses his job. But lucky for him,
he already has a biker nickname, Poet, and runs into a gang of bikers who
invite him to hang around with them.
The movie features a lot of brawls, a lot of riding, and a lot of partying. And to
make things even more exciting, love-struck Poet falls for the gang leader’s
girl, Shill, who’s played by actress Sabrina Scharf. Sigh. He has morals, 
doesn’t believe the gang life is for Shill, and tries to talk her into leaving the
gang with him.
Hell’s Belles (1969)
In Hell’s Belles, a dirt bike racer named Dan, played by actor Jeremy Slate,
gets his bike stolen by a motorcycle gang. When he tries to get it back, he
ends up being given a biker chick named Cathy (Jocelyn Lane) in exchange
for it. Hmmm. But he still wants his bike back. So, with Cathy in tow, he hunts
down gang members individually and in pairs. I still have no idea why they
named the movie Hell’s Belles. After all, the movie revolves around the dirt
bike rider and his lady friend.
304
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Easy Rider (1969)
In Easy Rider, Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper are a couple of hippie bikers
named Wyatt and Billy who hop on their machines and take off in search of
adventure in the American South and Southwest. They’re just modern-day
cowboys looking for the freedom to be themselves and have a good time.
Fonda and Hopper link up with Jack Nicholson, who plays a lawyer, along 
the way. What do they find on their journey? The freedom of the open road,
drugs, communes, and rednecks. Easy Rider isn’t really a biker gang movie.
Instead, it’s a movie about riding, exploring, discovering, and understanding
the counterculture of the late 1960s.
Little Fauss and Big Halsy (1970)
In the movie Little Fauss and Big Halsy, Robert Redford stars as Big Halsy, a
motorcycle racer. Michael Pollard, who’s referred to as Little Fauss, is Redford’s
mechanic and team owner in their unsuccessful efforts to win various forms
of motorcycle races. Redford is a cocky womanizer while Fauss is talented
but unsure of himself. The movie revolves around their strained relationship,
with a love interest for Redford thrown in for kicks.
On Any Sunday (1972)
More than 30 years later, many riders still consider On Any Sunday the best
motorcycle movie ever made. Filmmaker Bruce Brown made the surfing doc-
umentary The Endless Summer in 1966, and then followed up with On Any
Sunday, a motorcycling documentary. Why that title? Because the movie
focuses on racing, both amateur and professional, and on any given Sunday
across the United States you can find racers in the dirt and on the racetracks.
On Any Sunday looks at various forms of motorcycle sport from cross-coun-
try racing and hillclimbing to dirt-track racing and more. The film also shows
regular people just having fun riding their motorcycles. Well, that is, if you
consider actor Steve McQueen and racers Mert Lawwill and Malcolm Smith
regular people.
This documentary showed America that motorcyclists aren’t thugs out to pil-
lage towns, but are simply regular folks with a passion for their sport. It also
showed how fun motorcycling truly is.
305
Chapter 21: Ten Must-See Motorcycling Movies

Take It to the Limit (1980)
Take It to the Limit is a documentary that gives the viewer a good idea of the
excitement of racing motorcycles on asphalt and dirt ovals. In fact, this movie
has some incredible footage that’s astounding to everyone, even longtime
motorcyclists. Racer Kenny Roberts’ come-from-behind win at the Indianapolis
Mile in 1975 aboard a dirt-track machine with a powerful Yamaha TZ750 road-
racing motor shoehorned into it is legendary. “They don’t pay me enough to
ride that thing,” Roberts said afterward.
Various roadracing stars show what it’s like to take on the world on asphalt
racetracks at 180 mph. Russ Collins shows what it’s like to rocket down the
quarter-mile drag strip, and Mick Andrews and Debbie Evans slow things
down by doing tricks on their dirt machines. Also significant is footage of the
legendary Mike “the Bike” Hailwood racing on the streets at the Isle of Man in
Great Britain.
Chopper Chicks in Zombietown (1991)
I warn you now: Chopper Chicks in Zombietown is a pretty bad movie. Unless,
of course, you like this kind of bad-acting entertainment (and a lot of people
out there do!). A female biker gang rides into the town of Zariah in search of
well, men, only to discover (gasp) a zombie horde on a rampage. This movie
has it all: biker chicks, midgets, zombies, blind orphans, and more. Jamie
Rose plays Dede, Catherine Carlen plays Rox, and Lycia Naff is T.C.
Beyond the Law (1992)
In Beyond the Law, Charlie Sheen plays an undercover cop who infiltrates a
motorcycle gang. As you can imagine, mayhem follows. The gang is made up
of tough guys who are into drugs and guns, and Sheen has to prove himself a
bad guy to keep in the good graces of the gang. The movie surveys how far
he can go in committing crimes without crossing the line from cop to crimi-
nal. Believe it or not, this is a pretty good movie.

Appendix A
A Motorcycling Glossary: 
Talking the Talk
M
otorcyclists have their own unique language, and to fit in you need to
know at least some of the stuff that they’re talking about. Once you
become a motorcyclist, you’ll catch on to the special language quickly. Until
then, however, take a glance through some of the key words and phrases in
this glossary. That way you don’t feel like an outsider when you’re hanging
around your fellow motorcyclists. This glossary is just a taste of the words
you’ll hear while hanging around, and talking to motorcyclists. It is by no
means a complete dictionary of the motorcycling language. It simply gives
you a good start.
ABS: The shorthand way to refer to an anti-lock braking system. This system
prevents your motorcycle’s brakes from locking up. This system pulses the
brakes rapidly instead of fully locking the wheel, allowing the rider to keep
control under extreme braking instead of sliding a wheel.
aftermarket: The industry that makes parts for bikes. An aftermarket part is
one that’s bought for your bike from a maker other than your bike’s manufac-
turer. An example is an aftermarket exhaust system.
air-cooled motor: An engine that’s cooled by air flowing over it (rather than
one that’s cooled with a radiator).
AMA: The American Motorcyclist Association, which is the largest motor-
cyclists association in the world. The AMA concentrates on rights, riding, 
and racing.
American cruiser: Normally means a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, but also
can mean a Victory motorcycle. Both are made in America. American cruiser
is used to distinguish the machine from a metric cruiser, which is made in
Japan.
ape hangers: Handlebars on custom bikes that are higher than a rider’s
shoulders. They’re illegal in some states.

apex: The tightest point, or center, of a turn or curve. This is a point in a turn
or curve that a motorcyclist should ride through to take a normal turn or
curve correctly.
auger in: When riders crash their dirt bikes and land head first in the dirt.
bagger: A big touring machine with saddlebags or luggage. Also known as a
dresser.
Beemer: A BMW motorcycle.
belt drive: A belt final drive that connects the motor to the rear wheel. Used
mostly on Harley-Davidsons, some cruisers, and Buell sportbikes. See final
drive.
blip the throttle: A quick back-and-forward twist of the throttle to quickly
raise and lower the engine’s rpms.
BMW MOA: The BMW Motorcycle Owners of America, which is a nationwide
club.
camber: A term referring to the tilt of the road surface or racetrack. For exam-
ple, a positive camber turn is a turn where the asphalt tilts inward, providing
for more traction around the turn so you can lean your motorcycle further. 
An off-camber turn, on the other hand, means the asphalt tilts in the opposite
direction of the turn, providing for less traction (which can be dangerous) so
you shouldn’t lean your motorcycle over as far as you would in a positive
camber turn.
chain drive: A drive that uses a chain to transfer power from a front sprocket
connected to the motor to a rear sprocket connected to the rear wheel. See
final drive.
chicane: An S-turn that’s put on the straightaway of a racetrack to slow the
bikes down.
chopper: A bike with many items removed to make it faster and lighter. These
machines usually have long front forks, wild paint jobs, and special handle-
bars. Choppers can be built from a bike that was bought from the factory or
can be built from the ground up.
colors: The patch on the back of a motorcycle club member’s jacket that
identifies the club.
contact patch: The part of the tire that touches the road.
310
Part VI: Appendixes 

The Corkscrew: Probably the most famous racetrack corner in all of motor-
cycle racing. It’s at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca in Monterey, California, and
it consists of a sharp left, right turn that drops down a steep hill.
countershaft: The front sprocket attached to the motor that a chain rolls on
to transfer power to the rear wheel.
countersteering: A steering technique in which you push the left handlebar
(rather than pull) to turn left and push the right handlebar to turn right.
cross up: A classic motorcycle trick. It can be in reference to when a dirt bike
is in the air after taking a jump or when a streetbike’s front wheel is in the air
and the rider turns the handlebars fully to the left or the right.
crotch rocket: A sportbike. This term is considered somewhat derogatory.
cruiser: A motorcycle made for cruising. This bike is characterized by low
seat height, high weight, and a torquey motor.
custom: A bike, with the characteristics of a chopper, which was built from
the ground up. Show customs are usually very flashy and very expensive.
displacement: The size of a motorcycle engine, given in cubic inches or cubic
centimeters. It’s a measurement of the volume of the cylinders. Generally, the
bigger the displacement the more powerful the motor.
DOT: Federal Department of Transportation. All helmets sold in the United
States must be approved by the Department of Transportation and have a
DOT sticker.
dual-purpose bike: A motorcycle designed for both road and off-road use.
Generally it’s a dirt-focused bike with equipment added to make it street
legal. Also known as a dual-sport.
Duck: A Ducati motorcycle.
Enduro: A dirt-oriented bike with a headlight and taillight but that isn’t street
legal.
Engine braking: Using the engine, rather than the brakes, to slow down by
downshifting, letting off on the throttle, and letting out the clutch.
engine cutoff switch: This switch, which is normally on the right handlebar,
allows the rider to turn off the engine without taking a hand off the handle-
bars. Also known as a kill switch.
311
Appendix A: A Motorcycling Glossary: Talking the Talk

ergonomics: The relationship of the components on a bike to the rider. Good
ergonomics means that the bike fits a rider well. Bad ergonomics means that
a rider may have to really stretch to reach the handlebars, for example, or
could have an uncomfortable seating position because of the location of the
footpegs.
face plant: When riders crash their dirt bikes and land face first in the dirt.
fairing: The bodywork on the front or sides of a motorcycle. The front fairing
and windscreen normally deflect air, while the side fairings improve 
aerodynamics.
final drive: The system for transferring power from the engine to the rear
wheel. A chain drive is the most common type of final drive, but others
include belt and shaft drives.
floorboards: Flat panels for placement of the feet instead of footpegs. These
are found on some baggers and cruisers.
forks: The metal tubes on the front of a motorcycle that connect the front
wheel to the chassis of the bike.
gauntlet: The part of a motorcycle glove that extends beyond the wrist.
gearbox: Another name for a motorcycle’s transmission.
Gixxer: A Suzuki GSX-R motorcycle.
hairpin: A tight bend in the road that turns back toward the direction it
started. Generally this is a 180-degree turn.
heel-toe shifter: A shift lever that allows the rider to shift gears with either
the heel or the toe of a boot.
highside: When a rider is flipped over the high side of a motorcycle. This
usually happens when the rider loses traction while leaned over in a turn and
then abruptly catches traction again. A highside is the opposite of a lowside.
Hog: The trademarked nickname for a big Harley-Davidson motorcycle.
H.O.G.: The Harley Owners Group, which is a national club of Harley-Davidson
owners.
horsepower: A way to measure energy. One horsepower equals lifting 33,000
pounds up one foot over one minute. It’s used to illustrate the power of
motors.
312
Part VI: Appendixes 

Husky: A Husqvarna motorcycle.
line: The path taken by a motorcycle, especially around a turn. This term 
is commonly used when discussing racing lines around a racetrack. For
instance, you may hear someone referring to the inside line when a racer
passes another racer on the inside of a corner, or the outside line when the
racer goes around the outside of the other racer.
locked up: When a tire stops spinning. This can also refer to a motor where
the pistons have seized and are stuck, which is also called a frozen motor.
lowside: When a motorcycle slides out in a turn because of a lack of traction,
causing the rider to fall off the motorcycle on the low side of the bike.
lugging the motor: When a rider operates the motorcycle at very low rpms
and the motor jerks. Lugging the motor isn’t considered a good thing.
metric cruiser: A cruiser made in Japan.
MotoGP: An international motorcycling roadracing championship. The MotoGP
class of the MotoGP championship features specialized 800cc, four-stroke
bikes. These roadracers are considered the best in the world. It’s considered
the top rank of motorcycle roadracing competition.
MRF: The Motorcycle Riders Foundation, which is a motorcyclist rights group.
MSF: The Motorcycle Safety Foundation, which is best known for offering
internationally respected rider safety training.
OEM: The original equipment manufacturer of a bike. These are the motor-
cycle factories as opposed to the aftermarket industry.
off-road motorcycle: A motorcycle built for riding off road.
one-piece: A one-piece riding suit; usually a roadracing suit made of leather.
panniers: Saddlebags or luggage that mounts on the side rear of a motorcycle.
pin it: When a rider twists a motorcycle’s throttle all the way open.
poser: Someone who pretends to be a motorcyclist, either by rarely riding his
or her motorcycle and just showing up at events for the lifestyle or by wear-
ing motorcyclist garb without owning a motorcycle.
powerband: The rpm range in which an engine makes the most power.
313
Appendix A: A Motorcycling Glossary: Talking the Talk

Power cruiser: Cruisers with more powerful motors and usually beefed-up
suspension and braking components compared to regular cruisers.
redline: The maximum rpms at which an engine can operate without damage.
The redline is usually marked on an analog tachometer. Or, to avoid damaging
the motor, a bike also may have a rev limiter that cuts out the engine momen-
tarily when the redline is reached.
RPMs: The abbreviation for revolutions per minute. This is in reference to the
revolutions per minute of the motor’s piston or pistons.
seizure: When the piston or pistons in an engine stop moving up and down
after getting too hot (due to a lack of lubrication) and expanding to the point
that they won’t move in their cylinders. This stoppage locks up the drivetrain
and rear wheel. A seizure can be temporary, but if it isn’t, and the motor can’t
be unstuck, such an engine is considered “frozen.” A seizure can happen when
you exceed the redline for too long.
short shift: When you shift into a higher gear at lower rpms rather than wait-
ing until you get near heart of the powerband as you normally would. Short
shifting is normally done when roads are slick (so you don’t spin the rear
wheel) or when you want to keep the noise of your exhaust system quiet
while riding through a neighborhood.
six-speed: A transmission with six gears.
slick: A super sticky, treadless racing tire. These tires are dangerous, and ille-
gal, for street use.
spark arrester: A device that goes on the end of an exhaust pipe of an off-road
motorcycle so that no sparks come out of the pipe, which could possibly cause
a forest fire.
specs: Shorthand for specifications for a motorcycle, such as horsepower,
seat height, wheelbase, weight, and how many gallons of gas the tank holds.
squid: A new or reckless rider who rides over his or her abilities. It’s a com-
monly used but derogatory term.
stoppie: When a rider lifts a motorcycle’s rear wheel off the ground by quickly
and forcefully applying the front brakes. This is an illegal maneuver on the
street.
straight pipes: Exhaust pipes with no baffles; these pipes are extremely loud.
sweeper: A long, gentle curve or turn in the road.
314
Part VI: Appendixes 

torque: This is a measurement of force, usually in foot-pounds or inch-pounds.
tourer: Long-distance motorcycles built for comfort. They’re big, heavy, and
able to click off thousands of miles on the road easily.
traction: The grip between the tire and the road.
two-piece: A two-piece riding suit in which the jacket and pants zip together
at the waist.
wheelbase: The distance between the axles of the front wheel and the 
rear wheel. A shorter wheelbase usually means that a bike will turn more
quickly, while a longer wheelbase gives a bike more straight-line stability.
wheelie: Using the power of the motor to pull the front wheel off the ground.
This is an illegal maneuver on the street.
Willie G.: Nickname for Willie G. Davidson, who’s the styling guru at the
Harley-Davidson Motor Company and grandson of William A. Davidson, 
one of the company’s original founders.

State Motorcycling Laws
A
s a motorcyclist, you may decide to take a trip to another state or even
to several states. If you do, you better know the laws for those states. 
(I guarantee the police officer won’t be lenient if you plead ignorance.) For
example, some states require you to wear a helmet, and some states don’t
(though you should always wear one regardless of the law).
The following is some basic information on the motorcycling laws in all 50
states, courtesy of the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA). Before
making your trip, check to see whether any of these laws have changed by
