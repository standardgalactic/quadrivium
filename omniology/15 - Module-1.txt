What is Operating System?
As per Wikipedia
An operating system is system software that manages computer hardware and software 
resources, and provides common services for computer programs
In simple words
An operating system (OS) is software that acts as a middleman or a bridge between 
computer hardware and the computer user. It provides a user interface and controls the 
computer hardware so that software can function
Types of  Operating Systems:
1.
Desktop Operating Systems, e.g., Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux such as Ubuntu
2.
Server Operating Systems, e.g., Windows Server, Linux distributions like CentOS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux
3.
Mobile Operating Systems, e.g., Android, iOS, Windows Mobile
4.
Embedded Operating Systems used in devices like routers, smart TVs, automobiles, home appliances etc.
5.
Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS) used in critical systems like medical equipment, car ECUs, aerospace, 
defense, network firewalls, home security system etc.

• Linux, in simple terms, is a free and open-source operating system
• It’s similar to Windows and macOS, but it's different in several ways
• Linux is very popular for its stability, security, and flexibility. It can be modified and distributed by anyone, 
which has led to many different versions, known as "distributions," and each distribution is tailored for 
different uses
• Its open-source nature means that a community of developers and users contribute to its development

• Origins and Development:
• Unix: Originated in the 1970s at AT&T's Bell Labs. It was developed by Ken Thompson, Dennis 
Ritchie, and others
• Linux: Created in the early 1990s by Linus Torvalds. It's free and open-source, meaning its source 
code can be used, modified, and distributed by anyone
• OS Distribution:
• Unix: Solaris, HP-UX, AIX. BSD etc.
• Linux: Red Hat, CentOS, Fedora, Ubuntu, SUSE, Kali etc.
• Licensing and Cost:
• Unix: Generally requires a paid license, especially for commercial use
• Linux: Free to use, modify, and distribute
• Community and Development:
• Unix: Development and updates are controlled by the owning organization
• Linux: Maintained and developed by a global community of developers
• Hardware Support:
• Unix: Traditionally supports less hardware variety compared to Linux
• Linux: Known for its broad hardware support, including both traditional PCs and servers as well 
as embedded devices.
