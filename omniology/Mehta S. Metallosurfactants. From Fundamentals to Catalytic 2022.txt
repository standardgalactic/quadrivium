Preface
This book introduces its readers to a very special class of amphiphiles termed as
“metallosurfactants” from here on, incorporating a metal in the usual surfactant
system. A book in this area has been long outstanding. When we started working
on the metallosurfactants a few years back, we always felt the need for a holy grail
or a guiding text to delve deeper into the realm of metal surfactant complexes or
metallosurfactants. Something which could explain the fundamentals of the metal
surfactant complexes in detail while highlighting the current progress as well as the
future prospective. Back then, we would have been thrilled to get our hands on some-
thing like this. So, a lot of the topics included in this book stem from the difficulties
we faced while doing the literature survey and understanding this complex topic a
little better. The book has, therefore, been designed in such a way to provide a grad-
ual evolution starting from the very basics to the more advanced concepts and then
finally dealing with the applications of metallosurfactants including but not lim-
ited to catalytic, sensing, and biomedical fields. The book has been divided into 13
chapters. The first three chapters are associated with the synthesis and character-
ization of metallosurfactants followed by an investigation of their surface, interfa-
cial and aggregation behavior. Accordingly, building on their properties, a variety of
applications for the metallosurfactants have been discussed, highlighting the current
status and development in the areas including catalysts for organic and esterolytic
reactions, hydrogen generation, drug-delivery vehicles, molecular machines, trans-
fection, nanoparticle synthesis, anticancer and antimicrobial activities, CORMs, and
sensors in the subsequent Chapters 4–13. This book is intended for introductory
graduate-level metallosurfactant chemistry and the researchers working in this field.
We believe that fellow scientists from both academia and industry would find this
book to be a concise, informative yet interesting read.

Introduction
Recently, “surface chemistry” has gained enormous amount of attention in bring-
ing the vivid paradigm of synthetic chemistry [1]. Owing to the splendid attributes,
being offered by it, a vast majority of the leading researchers, scientists, and physical
chemists across the globe are putting their exertions to envisage noble advancements
in this illustrious domain [2]. The inception of this field can be dated back to the late
seventeenth century. It was through the numerous experiments (to study the phe-
nomenon responsible for spontaneous spreading of oil-on-water) conducted by the
famous physician Sir Benjamin Franklin that the early breakthroughs in this domain
were achieved [3]. This innovation later on proved to be a souvenir and became the
underlying fundamental basis for the upcoming research and development in this
field [4].
In subsequent decades, a colossal growth has been witnessed in the dominion of
surface chemistry, and the corresponding systematic findings have actually trans-
formed variegated scientific disciplines [5]. It is because of this particular realm that
the eminent fields such as colloid chemistry, interface science and surface engineer-
ing came into existence.
Several other eminent and impending disciplines viz. nanoscience, energy
conversion, and catalysis have also momentously gained from it [6]. In other words,
surface chemistry has essentially laid down the underpinning stone for voluminous
superlative fields [7]. Henceforth, it can be rightly said that “surfactants, a portman-
teau of surface-active agents” as we call them have proven to be highly potent agents
(Figure 1.1) [8–11]. Amidst, all the molecules investigated in the realm of chemistry,
surfactants are most exclusively studied. Owing to their exceptional solution and
interfacial properties, they are currently being utilized on a widespread level in
several fields.
Surfactants can be defined as the “materials which when present at low concentra-
tions, alters the interfacial free energies of the interfaces via adsorbing themselves onto

the interface/surface of the system” [8, 12–20]. They generally fall under the category
of organic compounds and are truly amphiphilic in nature [21].
When it comes to structural organization, surfactants usually comprises of two
vital components the first one being the head (polar) group, which is hydrophilic
in nature [22, 23], and the second part often referred to as the tail (non-polar)
group is hydrophobic (lipophilic) in nature [24]. It is mostly observed that the
polar head group varies greatly in structure and can be multifaceted, while the
tail group demonstrates less diversity and as a rule it primarily comprises of a
hydrocarbon (alkyl) chain with 8–20 carbon atoms. Broadly speaking, the tail
can be branched/linear hydrocarbon, aliphatic, alkyl/aryl, short/long whereas;
the head group can be ionic/non-ionic [21–23]. These chemical moieties have an
innate ability to affect the air–water interface in an articulate fashion. This might
be attributed to the reduction in the surface tension (interfacial tension) of water
and formation of assorted assemblies (micelles) at the interface [10, 25]. Upon
adsorption at the interface, the two characteristic portions of the surfactants viz.
head and tail group align themselves according to their polarities/preferential
solubilities. The polar head group align itself toward the aqueous (water) part,
while the tail group orient itself away from the water (outward direction) thereby
resulting in the formation of micelles [26].
When dispersed in aqueous phase, at low concentration these surfactants gener-
ally exist in monomeric/dimeric state. An increase in their concentration beyond a
designated threshold (viz. critical micellar concentration [CMC]) leads to the sponta-
neous accumulation of surfactant monomers. This further results in the formation
of assemblies/colloidal-sized clusters also commonly referred to as “micelles”
[4, 7, 26, 27]. A major share of this potential breakthrough goes to James William
McBain, whose discovery inevitably changed the dynamics and lead to signif-
icant advancements in the field of surface/surfactant chemistry [12, 27–29]. It
was in the year 1916, while conducting his research experiments, he observed

infrequent alteration in the electro-conductive physiognomies as a function of soap
concentration and he coined the term “micelles” [30].
Nowadays, a dire need is felt for the upgradation and development of novel tech-
nologies, which will play an intricate role in improvising the varied aspects of human
lives. This upsurge calls for a quick modification of the surfaces in order to perfectly
align with these rapid advancements [31]. Herein, the innate potential to alter the
interfaces as per the requisite demand plays a pivotal role in envisaging and devising
innovative technological advancements, ranging from energy production to biomed-
ical implants, which will offer promising outcomes [12, 27]. Incessant strides are
being made in the field of science and technology on a regular basis to attain the
aforementioned goal.
Irrespective of the fact that these chemical moieties possess such dynamic
properties yet, they have not been able to secure a place for themselves among
the “catalogue of advanced materials” [32]. In lieu of this, unique complexes with
pre-selected functionalities (viz. proteins, carbohydrates, and metal ions) have been
developed, which comprehensively aided in triumphing the lacunas associated with
conventional surfactant systems. Additionally, incorporation of such modalities
resulted in the fabrication of novel surfactants with engineered interfacial attributes
[31]. Among all functional groups/modalities, metal ions have played a pivotal
role in escalating the physicochemical attributes of the conventional surfactants
exponentially. This in particular has lately led to the emergence of remarkable, and
idiosyncratic complexes commonly referred to as metallosurfactants (MTS) [33].
1.2
Intrinsic Physiognomies of Metallosurfactants
Self-aggregation/association/assembly above CMC is an intrinsic property, which
makes these surfactants and amphiphilic structures an invigorated tool. Length and
volume of lipophilic component, size and charge of the polar head group, type of
interaction with the solvent system, ionic strength, and molecular framework of the
system are some of domineering factors, which tend to govern the hydrodynamic
radii (particle size), and surface charge (zeta potential) of these singular entities
[34–36]. The whole credit for this fundamental concept of aggregation goes to
Zhulina et al. [35]. It was because of their incessant attempts that a comprehensive
overview of this distinguishing phenomenon could be deciphered more than
30 years ago [37, 38].
With an advent in time, several triumphant advancements have been accom-
plished in the field of surfactant chemistry. These progressions have broadened up
the horizons of our understanding in lieu of surfactants. Similarly, the underlying
concepts providing an inclusive aftermath of the phenomenon have also upgraded
in recent years. This upgradation vindicated the fact that it is the metal ion, which
plays a pivotal role in regulating the self-aggregation behavior of MTS/MTSC,
respectively [34]. Whilst, the positioning of the metal ion component (counter
ion/integral component) in the base matrix does not seem to have an obligatory
effect on the assembling phenomenon.

1 Metallosurfactants, a “Novel Portmanteau”
When dispersed in aqueous media, these MTS tends to “diminish the characteristic
qualities of metalloenzymes” [39]. Therefore, the MTSC felicitates a self-aggregation/
association of distinct metal-complex-based aggregates reciprocating the aggre-
gation number equivalent to their counterparts viz. surfactants [15, 39]. This
distinguishing property to self-aggregate, and formulate idiosyncratic complexes
bestow these MTS with unique potential applications, which can prove to be
handy in real-time scenario [39]. Additionally, the complexes so generated possess
multiphasic properties, and can solubilize an array of diverse chemical moieties
i.e. lipophilic/hydrophilic, and ionic components [13]. Depending upon the CMC
value, distinctive structures illustrating assorted geometrical facets viz. micelles
(spherical, oblate/prolate/ellipsoid, hybrid crystals with layered perovskite struc-
ture), and aggregates (vesicles, bilayers, helixes, tubules) are customarily formed by
this special class of metallic surfactants [40–43].
As compared to their conventional counterparts, CMC of these metal-based sur-
factant complexes is very less. Henceforth, the presence of MTS at a miniscule con-
centration is potent enough to bring a substantial saturation at the interfacial point
along with a significant micelle formation [44]. Apart from these facts and find-
ings, it has also been deciphered by studies that the self-assembly of MTS is greatly
affected by two key factors i.e. nature of transition metal ion and differences in coor-
dination at atomic scale. To gain a holistic view of the aforementioned fact, let us
briefly discuss the effects of ions, solvents, and structures on micellar morphology
with some examples:
a) Metal ion – If a conventional surfactant is dispersed in water, a simple micelle
is formed, while incorporation of a metal ion in the base structure results in a
significant alteration in the geometrical facet, and surface charge of the MTS. In
place of the micelle, formation of a vesicle takes place usually [45–47].
b) Solvent system – A reverse micelle having a metallic amphiphilic bilayer is
formed upon the dispersion of an MTS (having multiple alkyl chains attached
to a metal ion) in non-polar solvent while, such a phenomenon is absent in con-
ventional surfactant systems [18, 48, 49]. Upon dispersion into less polar organic
solvents (viz. chloroform, and diethyl ether), these MTS tends to aggregate, and
formulation of inverted metallomicelles takes place. This phenomenon can be
principally attributed to the non-covalent interactions which encourage the ori-
entation of the reactive head group in a miniscule volume thereby ultimately
resulting in the generation of a highly concentrated and catalytically active cavity
of colloidal frameworks.
c) Structural factor – Formation of micelle takes place in case of an aqueous
dispersion of single-chain MTS while vesicles are formed upon dispersion of
double-chain MTS in aqueous media [50–52]. This can be further explained
based upon the morphology of the metallic surfactants. Cylindrical morphology
of the double-chain MTS, and interaction of metal ion with two surfactant
molecules results in the formation of a pseudo-double-chain surfactant (PDCS).
During the PDCS generation, the molecules orient themselves in such a manner,
that the packing assumes a vesicular structure [53–55].

https://www.twirpx.org & http://chemistry-chemists.com
1.2 Intrinsic Physiognomies of Metallosurfactants
5
Apart from this, the cross-sectional area of both the vital components i.e. head
and tail region is altered due to the incorporation of metallic ion in the core struc-
ture. This alteration creates a demarcating change in the packing volume, thereby
inducing a series of phase transition in the metalloaggregates. The phase transi-
tions ultimately result in the fabrication of vesicles with vivid structural forms
(viz. unilamellar, multi-lamellar/vesicular) [56–58].
With the aid of MTS, an assortment of vivid physicochemical attributes of metal
ions can be localized at air–water/oil–water interface. Henceforth, it would be appo-
site to state, “the MTS are an exceptional class of surfactant system, which technically
amalgamated two diverse area of science i.e. co-ordination and surface chemistry in a
coherent manner” and this leads to the emergence of a noble omnipotent scientific
domain. Amidst a wide array of characteristics, redox activity is deemed to be the pre-
dominant one. The inculcated metallic ion tends to possess a variable oxidation state,
and it is because of this inherent property that these MTS are able to illustrate such
a noteworthy ability. The traditional surfactant systems lacks this capability as their
core framework is largely composed of elements-like carbon, oxygen and sulfur [45].
On a comparative note, it has been established repeatedly, that MTS essentially
bestow enhanced chemical reactivity as compared to their conventional counter-
parts. Charge, valency, and empty d/f orbitals entangled with metal ions are some
of the pivotal factors, which escalates the chemical reactivity of these superior class
of metal surfactants to many fold times [18]. In other words, it can be righteously
stated that the “base surfactant itself does not have any chemical reactivity” [18, 45].
However, it is the embodiment of the metal ion, which brings a radical change in
the chemical state of the pristine surfactant, thereby efficaciously circumventing the
existing lacuna associated with the traditional surfactant systems [45].
Incorporating metal ions possessing energy levels equivalent to those of the visible
transitions (taking place in the UV–visible region) imparts a chromophoric ability to
the MTS. It is because of this intricate potential that these metal-based surfactants
exhibit illustrious and bright colors (e.g. Cu2+ [blue], Fe2+/Fe3+ [yellowish red], and
Ni2+ [green]). This might be attributed to the d–d transition of the metal ion, which
is positioned in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Additionally, it is
well versed that the alteration in color is exclusively dependent upon the surround-
ing chemical milieu. This facilitates the user with a tranquil access where he/she
can control the reaction conditions in a complacent manner [45].
In an analogous manner, inculcation of a paramagnetic/ferromagnetic metal ion
within the framework of the soft matter imparts magnetic properties to the surfac-
tants, which are fundamentally diamagnetic in nature [18]. The stimuli (magnetic
field)-responsive surfactants depicts a novel class of surfactants, wherein the sur-
face tension can be simply modulated by switching on/off the applied magnetic field.
Distinct from all of this Lewis acidity, pH responsiveness, and structural diversity are
some of the other striking attributes, which are exemplified by these MTS [51, 54, 57].
It seems from the aforementioned facts and findings, that the metal ion is the only
component, which is responsible for allocating such eminent characteristics how-
ever, in real sense it is not so. The soft matter also adds significantly to the metal-ion

chemistry. Active transfer of the above-mentioned attributes to the interface
is typically accomplished due to the surface-active property of the surfactant.
Henceforth, it is the reunion of the characteristic chattels of both the components,
which led to the acquirement of such distinctive physicochemical attributes [48].
Owing to such exceptional attributes, this special class of building blocks have
been utilized in many fields vis-à-vis (i) surface activation agents, (ii) monolayers,
(iii) emulsions, (iv) contrast agents (medical resonance imaging), (v) catalysts
(homogenous photo catalysis), (vi) transporting and sensing agents (fluorescent
sensors), (vii) binders and metal extractors, (viii) redox agents (biological system),
(ix) vectors for drug delivery (nanoparticles), (x) thin-film optoelectronic devices,
(xi) solvatochromic probes, (xii) interfacial photo-physical agents, (xiii) templates
for fabrication of diverse frameworks (micelles, vesicles, bilayers, liquid crystals,
mesoporous materials, and metallomesogens), and (xiv) antimicrobial agents (viz.
antibacterial, antiparasitic, anthelminthic) [50, 59, 60].
1.3
Classiﬁcation of Metallosurfactants
In pertinent literature, a vast majority of systems have been outlined, which tends
to intrinsically categorize these tailored/engineered hybrid surface-active moieties
based upon certain distinctive characteristics. One such classification system relies
upon the type of bonding between the metal ion, and the soft matter (surfactant).
According to this system, surfactants comprising of inorganic moieties are generally
referred to as inorganic surfactants (viz. I-SURFs) [18, 45]. I-SURFs can be categor-
ically sub-divided into two major categories viz.
a) I-SURFs type I – These are the simplest type of surfactants, in which the metal
ion is incorporated within the conventional surfactant. Herein, the metal ion
plays a definitive role, and acts as a counter ion.
b) I-SURFs type II – In such kind of hybrid surfactants, the metal ion acts as an
integral part of the polar head group. Type II I-SURFs can be further divided into
two prominent types i.e. type II a, and type II b. In type II I-SURFS, the metal
ion is localized within the polar head group component of the soft matter. In the
latter one, the metal ion itself acts as the head group.
In the pertinent literature, another classification system, which shares analogous
fundamental basics to the aforementioned system, has been reported. In this
method, the MTS are chiefly classified into three major categories viz.
a) Group I – In this kind of metal-based surfactants, the hydrophilic head group acts
as a housing cavity for the positioning of the metal ion. Further, attachment of this
component with the hydrocarbon tail is accomplished via covalent binding [61].
b) Group II – These MTS represent a newer class of hybrid metallic surfactants. In
these hybrid surfactants, the hydrophobic part of the soft matter provides accom-
modation to the metal ion. Herein, the metal ion acts as an integral part of the
long alkyl chain, and it is with the help of co-ordination chemistry that this ionic
entity is connected with the hydrophobic segment [62].

1.3 Classiﬁcation of Metallosurfactants

c) Group III – In this type of hybrid surfactants, the counter ion of the soft matter
provides a housing cavity to the metallic ion. Herein, the metal ion is weakly
bonded with the surfactant and is localized within the counter ion segment [63].
Based upon their dissociation in water, a third type of classification system cate-
gorizes the MTS into two chief classes viz.
a) Cationic – Upon dispersion into an aqueous phase, these MTS are primarily
dissociated into two key components i.e. an amphiphilic cation, and an anion.
A major share of such MTS chiefly comprises of nitrogenous compounds
such as fatty amine salts, and quaternary ammoniums. These nitrogenous
functional groups are further attached to elongated single or multiple alkyl tails
(e.g. bis(2-phenylpyridine)(4,4-diheptadecyl-2,2-bipyridine)-iridium(III) chlo-
ride (Ir-complex)) [64].
b) Anionic – Unlike their predecessors, these MTS also dissociate into two major
components upon dispersion into an aqueous phase. However, the demarcation
lies in the fact that herein, an amphiphilic anion is generated in place of a
cation followed by the generation of a cation. Anionic surfactant viz. sodium
1,4-bis(neopentyloxy)-3-(neopentyloxycarbonyl)-1,4-dioxobutane-2-sulfonate
(TCl4) would constitute a perfect example of such a system [65]
The fourth classification system is distinctly apart from the earlier-described sys-
tems. Herein, depending upon the localization of metal ion in the soft matter, the
MTS can be classified into two broad categories as;
a) Metal ion in hydrophilic head group – In this class of hybrid metal-based
surfactant, hydrophobic component of the MTS primarily comprises of the alkyl
chain of the soft matter, while the metal ion along with its primary coordinated
sphere constitutes the polar head group [15, 60].
b) Metal ion in hydrophobic tail group – This type of MTS depicts divergent
attributes as juxtaposed to the former one. Herein, the metal ion is localized in
the hydrophobic (alkyl chain) segment (tail) of the soft matter [16, 40].
The fifth classification system can be considered as the core/base structural char-
acterization scheme. According to this classification schema, the MTS can be classi-
fied into five major categories as;
a) Single chained – In this class of MTS; the metal ion is incorporated with the
polar head group of the soft matter. Herein, the metal ion tends to play a definitive
role, and acts as a counter ion [66].
b) Double chained – This type of hybrid metallic surfactants possess an analogous
structure to that of the single-chain MTS. However, the major demarcation lies
in tail group. Alike its predecessor, the metal ion along with its primary coordi-
nation sphere acquires the functionality of the polar (hydrophilic) head group.
Whereas, on the other hand, the ligand along with the alkyl (hydrophobic) tail is
coordinated to the metal ion [67, 68].
c) Pseudogemini – With an advent in time, surfactant chemistry exemplified
astonishing progressions. These momentous advancements, paved a gallant way

https://www.twirpx.org & http://chemistry-chemists.com

1 Metallosurfactants, a “Novel Portmanteau”
for the fabrication of interesting class of novel surfactants viz. pseudogemini
surfactants. Pseudogemini MTS are single-chain analogues of gemini surfactants
[69]. They possess an explanatory complexed structure, in which the amphiphilic
ligands are attached to a centrally coordinated metal ion. MTS complex of an
“alkylsulfonatephosphine-functionalized alkyphenol ethoxylate” symbolizes an
interesting example of such a system [44].
d) Mixed ligand coordination complexes – These can be piously regarded as
the exalted class of MTS. In such MTS, a transition metal complexed with an
amphiphilic entity such as Schiff’s base is incorporated within the core frame-
work of a conventional surfactant [70].
e) Organometallic surfactants – These hybrid surfactants epitomizes the most
advanced series of metallic surfactants. It can be astutely stated, “it is because of
such illustrious moieties that the dynamics of surfactant chemistry has metamor-
phosed colossally.” Coming on to the schematic aspect, these MTS are analogous
to the traditional surfactants, as they also tend to possess a head and tail group.
Nonetheless, a major variance is generated due to the alteration in the chemical
nature of the molecular entities, which constitutes both these pivotal segments.
Herein, the head group usually constitutes of a transition metal embodied with
one of the components of the soft matter. Whilst, in the second region, the alkyl
chain is substituted with a functional group tagged π-conjugated chain, which
further acquires the functional role of the hydrophobic tail [71].
1.4
Syntheses Stratagems and Characterization
of Metallosurfactants
The facts and findings discussed above have provided us with a comprehensive
overview of the MTS and their intricate physiognomies. Now, it has become clear
that MTS are technically “amphiphilic entities comprising of coordinated metal ion/
ions.” Coming on to the syntheses part, polar or organic solvents play a vivacious
role in the syntheses of these exceptional classes of hybrid surfactants. Till date,
three distinctive synthesis routes have been devised for the syntheses of MTS;
1.4.1
Metathesis Reaction
A highly sophisticated and arduous methodology becomes pre-requisite when it
comes to the development of MTS possessing cationic metal species, and aliphatic
tails. In such circumstances, the following stratagem i.e. metathesis reaction (MR),
appears to be a unique one and offers several lucrative advantages viz. [72]
(i) One-pot synthesis.
(ii) Ease of extraction and cost effectiveness.
●Efficient recovery of catalyst – Employment of water-soluble catalyst
circumvents the need for re-extraction.

https://www.twirpx.org & http://chemistry-chemists.com
1.4 Syntheses Stratagems and Characterization of Metallosurfactants

●Minimized solvent consumption/wastage – Tranquil extraction of cata-
lyst can be accomplished with an aqueous phase. The aqueous phase can be
reused as such for subsequent reactions (continuous batch production).
●Ordinary reaction conditions – Does not require any specific reaction con-
ditions such as inert atmosphere, and degassing. The entire reaction can be
carried out at room temperature.
In general terms, an MR can be defined as a “reaction in which two distinct
chemical entities react in an aqueous phase to form a novel product.” Herein, the
formation of the new product usually takes place due to the double decomposition/
displacement reaction (interchanging of the radicals or ions of the reactant species).
MR, in other words, can be technically referred to as “the phenomenon of cation,
and anion exchange in a polar/aqueous phase” [73].
To understand the dynamics of the aforementioned synthesis schema, let us
consider certain examples. Lipshutz et al. carried out the synthesis of a “designer
surfactant” viz. PQS (nanomicelle-forming amphiphile) using a metathesis reaction
[74]. Herein, a well-versed ring-closing ruthenium catalyst i.e. Grubbs Hoveyda 1
Ru(II) was employed as an intermediate substrate for the catalyzing the entire reac-
tion. The present experiment exhibited promising outcomes and the results came
out to be extremely significant. Proposed methodology, i.e. micellar catalysis/ring
catalysis metathesis (RCM) allowed a successful covalent linking of the Ru carbene
with the designated chemical moiety, thereby, leading to a successful synthesis of
the novel MTS [74]. The synthesized PQS MTS offered three vivid key elements
viz. lipophilic segment (site for solubilization of insoluble organic substrates),
hydrophilic segment (solubilizes PQS in polar/aqueous solvent such as water), and
free –OH residue within the hydrophobic core (site bearing the metallic part). The
proposed methodology also offered a potent solution to overcome the pre-existing
lacunas of the conventional methodology. Pure water acted as the solvent system,
and during the entire reaction, room-temperature conditions were maintained. The
catalyst used was water soluble, and no re-isolation steps were further carried out.
Additionally, the proposed methodology facilitated the RCM of water-insoluble
dienic substrates [74].
1.4.2
Ligand Substitution Reaction
Ligand substitution reaction (LSR) is the second most preferred type of reaction,
when it comes to the synthesis of hybrid metal-based surfactants. As the name
itself suggests, the method generally involves the substitution of lesser labile
ligands with more labile ligands. In other words, it can be righteously said, that
in these types of reactions, interchange of highly susceptible ligands takes place
via the lesser ones. In lieu of this, Veeralakshmi et al. synthesized varied types
of single- and double-chained MTS possessing idiosyncratic biological function-
alities [75]. Facile employment of LSR led to the efficacious synthesis of hybrid
ligand-anchored metallic surfactant complexes. Herein, Co(dien)Cl3 acted as the

https://www.twirpx.org & http://chemistry-chemists.com
10
1 Metallosurfactants, a “Novel Portmanteau”
precursor excipient whilst, diethylenetriamine (dien), dodecylamine (DA), and
hexadecylamine (HA) were chosen as the model ligands. In the present experiment,
one or two amine groups of the alkylamine ligand base played an active role and
led to the substitution of one or two labile chloride ligands. This ligand-mediated
substitution ultimately resulted in the synthesis of four different types of MTS
viz. [Co(dien)(HA)Cl2]ClO4(III), [Co(dien)(DA)Cl2]ClO4(IV) [Co(dien)(HA)2Cl]
(ClO4)2(V), and [Co(dien)(DA)2Cl](ClO4)2(VI) [75].
1.4.3
Ligand Insertion Reaction
Last but not the least, ligand insertion reaction (LIR) is the third type of reaction,
which is predominantly employed for the synthesis of MTS. A distinctive feature
of this method is the maintenance of the integral nature of all the excipients being
employed during the reaction. Unlike, its predecessor i.e. LSR, this method does
not involve any substitution/elimination. The method preferred is the fabrication
of hybrid metal-surfactant complexes via interjecting a chemical moiety (usually a
ligand) into another molecule or a bond [19]. Following this approach, Wagay et al.
synthesized a hybrid MTS named cis-chlorobis(ethylenediamine)dodecylamine
cobalt(III) nitrate(I) (viz. CDCN) [67, 68, 76]. Herein, a dropwise addition of the
ligand i.e. dodecylamine (ethanolic solution) to trans-[Co(en)2Cl2]Cl (aqueous
solution) resulted in the attainment of the desired metal surfactant complex.
In another experiment, a double-chained MTS viz. cis-bis(1,3-diaminopropane)
bis(dodecylamine)cobalt(III) nitrate(II) (DDCN) was synthesized by the same group
using LIR methodology [76]. Analogous to the aforementioned methodology, the
preset method also involved a dropwise addition of ethanolic dodecylamine solution
(ligand) to an aqueous solution of trans-[Co(tmd)2Cl2]ClO (aqueous solution). This
in turn led to a successful synthesis of the desired hybrid metal–surfactant complex
i.e. DDCN.

characterization of synthesized MTS using high-tech analytical techniques gives an
edge to the researchers/chemists, and allows them to develop versatile MTS with
tailored properties. A wide array of analytical techniques ranging from simplistic
spectrophotometer to advanced techniques such as electron/ atomic microscopy
has been widely employed for the facile elucidation of intricate physiognomies.

characterization of novel MTS.

MTS represents a class of supra-molecular assemblies which can facilitate an effec-
tive bridging between both the explicit domains of chemistry viz. synthetic and inor-
ganic. It is because of this unique bridging that these exhilarating moieties with

tailored physiognomies can be fabricated with ease. Apart from this, the inimitable
metal-phase behavior of the MTS bestows them with a unique ability to formu-
late an extensive array of supramolecular structures. Additionally, the existence of
an interrelation between the two vivid domains viz. coordination chemistry and
surfactant self-assembly offers tremendous opportunities for these MTS to be applied
on a full-scale level in varied domains of science, and technology.

Introduction
The world of surface and colloid chemistry was first introduced to “micelle” at
the 1913 Faraday meeting in the context of the association of surfactant molecules
in aqueous solutions by James William McBain in his discussion contribution,
entitled: “on the mobility of highly-charged micelles” [1]. In 1920, McBain gave the
first indication of the concept of critical micelle concentration (CMC) mentioning
that these “micelles” formed only above a particular concentration, depicted by a
minimum in the conductivity–concentration curve, which opened up a new arena
to the researchers – the micellization and aggregation behavior of surfactants,
which has been very well explored since then. As is the case with the conventional
surfactants, these designer “metallosurfactants” also tend to demonstrate the
classical surfactant as well as non-classical behavior. Exploring and establishing
the surface-active behavior of these surfactants is vital for their perusal in several
applications. Because of the extensive research in the area of surfactant chemistry,
it has been concluded that the surfactants can even play a critical role in putting
an end to the devastating coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic,
which engulfed the whole world bringing it to a deadly standstill [2]. It has been
established that the addition of anionic surfactant generates a synergistic effect with
alcohols to inactivate the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 virus
and enhance the virucidal efficiency of commonly used sanitizers, which, in fact,
forms the first line of defense to combat the spread of virus. Therefore, investigation
into the surface-active behavior is both pertinent and necessary. The interfacial
and surface-active properties of some metallosurfactants have been brilliantly
reviewed by Griffiths et al. [3, 4]. The group has done tremendous research in
this area highlighting the fundamental traditional and non-traditional behavior

2 Metallosurfactants: A Surface and Interface Perspective
of metallosurfactants along with discussing their physico-chemical properties.
The chapter presented here typically deals with the effect of metal incorporation
on the surfactant behavior in both aqueous and non-aqueous solvents, consider-
ing the location of metal in the surfactant, i.e. head group, hydrophobic tail, or
the counter ion area. To get comprehensive information on the surface activity,
micellization and adsorption parameters of metallosurfactants and, hence, develop
a better understanding of their surface and interfacial characteristics, metallosur-
factants have been discussed here by subdividing them into three main categories
(i) Category I – Metal as part of the head group, (ii) Category II – Metal as the
counter ion, (iii) Category III – Metal as part of the hydrophobic chain.
2.2
Micellization and Surface Parameters
Surfactant molecules exist as monomers in aqueous solutions at low concen-
tration, but as the concentration increases the molecules tend to self-aggregate
to a variety of interesting shapes and structures such as micelles, vesicles, and
lamellae (Figure 2.1). At a specific concentration range, “micelles” are formed,
which is known as the CMC. The CMC value of a surfactant can be experimentally
determined from the plots of physical property against the surfactant concentration.
The abrupt change in a physical property marks the CMC value such as – (i) surface
tension: surfactants demonstrate classical surface activity with the surface tension
showing an initial decrease with increasing surfactant concentration, and then
eventually tapering to a constant value. The intercept of these two different slopes
defines the CMC (See Figure 2.2b); (ii) conductivity: the specific conductivity
versus surfactant concentration plots again show two straight lines with differ-
ent slopes. The first one corresponds to the monomers with the concentration
range below the CMC showing a rapid increase in conductivity and, thereafter,
micelles start forming. This phenomenon is marked by a change in slope of the
conductivity–concentration graph because the conductivity still increases but at a
relatively slow rate. The intersection point of these two straight lines with different
slopes forms the CMC value of the surfactant. The micellization behavior for met-
allosurfactants becomes more interesting as in addition to the usual hydrophobic
part, head group and the counter ion, metal ion also comes into play, which can be
present at any of the above three mentioned sites.

Largely, the metallosurfactants are formed with the metal inhabiting the head
group or counter ion, and a relatively small number of examples have metal in
the hydrophobic alkyl chain, which we will examine individually. In general,
the addition of metal leads to a considerable decrease in the CMC values of
metallosurfactants when compared to the traditional/conventional surfactant or
ligand systems. This has been attributed to various factors contingent with the
morphology of the metallosurfactants synthesized, which may include (i) increased
hydrophobicity ascribed to the presence of two alkyl chains, i.e. more non-polar
chains in case of double-chained surfactants, (ii) structural similarity to gemini
surfactant, leading to lower CMC values [7], (iii) decrease in overall hydrophilicity
and hydration of head group, (iv) decreased charge repulsion between head groups,
etc. which have been discussed in the Sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 in detail. The
conductivity and surface tension data obtained can be further utilized to evaluate
the thermodynamics of micellization and calculate various adsorption parameters.
2.2.1
Thermodynamics of Micellization
Cmc variation with temperature is analyzed in terms of phase separation or equi-
librium for micellization and delivers important information on the interactions
between hydrophobic part and head group, specifically leading to the computation
of several thermodynamic parameters of micellization such as β, counter ion
binding, ΔG∘
mic, Gibbs energy of micellization, ΔH∘
mic, enthalpy of micellization,
and ΔS∘
mic, entropy of micellization. The degree of micelle ionization or counter
ion binding (𝛽) for the complexes has been estimated from the ratio of slopes above
and below CMC in the conductivity versus concentration plots. ΔG∘
mic, ΔH∘
mic,
and ΔS∘
mic values are calculated with a view to explore the interactions during
micellization, particularly, the influence of ligand coordination on surfactant
properties. The standard Gibbs free energy of the micelle formation per mole of the
monomer, ΔG∘
mic, is given by Eq. (2.1)
ΔG∘
mic = −RT(2 −𝛽) ln Xcmc
(2.1)

where R, T, 𝛽, and XCMC represent gas constant, absolute temperature, degree of
micellar ionization, and CMC, in terms of mole fraction, respectively. Knowledge
of temperature-dependent CMC and 𝛽values leads to the calculation of enthalpy of
micellization, ΔH∘
mic using the Gibbs–Helmholtz relation.

(2.3)
2.2.2
Adsorption Parameters
While conductivity studies are usually undertaken to evaluate the thermodynamics
of micellization, surface tension can be used to calculate some more adsorption
parameters such as the area occupied per metallosurfactant molecule at the
water/air interface and surface excess concentration. When the surfactant starts
dissolving in water, the surfactant concentration at the interface or surface is much
higher than the volume phase due to adsorption known as the surface excess
concentration or maximum surface excess (Gmax). This is also reflected in the
surface tension values and calculated using the Gibbs adsorption isotherm equation
as given below in the units of mol cm−2:
Gmax = −
1
2.303nRT
(
δ𝛾
δlogC
)
T
(2.4)
where n = number of species in solution, T is absolute temperature, and R is
universal gas constant. Gmax is obtained by calculating the slope of the linear
decrease of surface tension below the CMC in the surface tension versus log C
(concentration) graph. Gmax leads to the calculation of another important param-
eter, which is A or minimum area occupied by each surfactant molecule at the
air–solvent interface. A provides useful information on the degree of packing and
the orientation of the adsorbed surfactant molecule and is computed using Eq. (2.5)
in the units of square angstrom:
A =
1016
N Γmax
(2.5)
where N is Avogadro’s constant and Gmax is maximum surface excess in mol cm−2.
A detailed investigation of the metallosurfactants and their evaluation based on
these numerical factors would be made in the subsequent section categorywise.
Different Types of Metal Surfactant Complexes/Metallosurfactants
and Micellization
Category I Complexes – Metal Ion as Part of the Head Group The most common type
of metallosurfactants are the ones where metal exists as an integral part of the
head group. Griffiths’ group has presented some interesting work over the years
with metallosurfactants. They have pioneered the synthesis of metallosurfactants
showing a strong coordination of metal ion to the head group. The complexes of the

type [MII(L) (H2O)2]Cl2 prepared with different metal (M = NiII, CuII) keeping the
ligand L based upon 1,4,7-triazacyclononane ([9]aneN3) same (Figure 2.2a) have
been utilized to check for the effect of metal ion change on micellization [5]. Using
the surface tension, CMC of the Ni surfactant is found to be 1.5 ± 0.2 mM while for
Cu the value is 0.8 ± 0.1 mM, lower than expected for a doubly charged amphiphile.
The decrease in CMC is attributed to a decrease in overall hydrophilicity due to the
presence of eight carbon centers in head group itself. A lower CMC value registered
for Cu surfactant as compared to Ni was attributed to the tendency for Cu to adopt
five-coordinate geometries resulting in a slightly smaller head-group area, lowering
the CMC. However, the adsorbed surfactant amount and area per molecule at
the surface remain same for both surfactants, 50 ± 5 Å2, undeterred by a change
in the metal ion. In a subsequent report, the head groups were changed slightly
with a little variation in ligands keeping the metal ion, i.e. Cu constant resulting in
the formation of [CuII(L1) (H2O)2]Cl2 and [CuII(L2)]Cl2 cationic surfactants. The
ligands L1 and L2 have been depicted in Figure 2.2a.
[CuII(L2)]Cl2 showed a higher CMC value of 5 mM compared to the 0.4 mM for
[CuII(L1) (H2O)2]Cl2, which stems from its greater ionic character as compared to
the latter [6]. Scattering studies suggest that metal ions are distributed throughout
the diffuse head-group region rather than being present as a thin shell, and the
ionic strength of the surfactants is determined to be dependent on the concentra-
tion of unimeric surfactant and free chloride counter ions. The group also carried
out an interesting study highlighting the effect of nature of counter ion and metal
ion on the micellization and CMC values by synthesizing a series of complexes [8],
i.e. [M(L1)(H2O)n]X2 type with M = Cu, X = Cl having a CMC of 0.50 ± 0.06 mM;
M = Cu, X = NO3–0.80 ± 0.05 mM; M = Cu, X = acetate −0.65 ± 0.03 mM; M = Cu,
X = SO4 – 0.45 ± 0.07 mM; M = Ni, X = Cl – 0.45 ± 0.06 mM, respectively. As reported,
all the derivatives showed almost negligible variation in CMC with a change in metal
ion or counter ion. This was supportive of the fact that the hydrophilic character and
charge on the head group did not vary with counter ion that was further confirmed
by the electronic spectra. But the CMC values registered quite a significant decrease
when compared to the conventional dodecyl sulfate (8 mM) or dodecylammonium
bromide (2 mM) surfactants, indicating a strong counter ion binding to the micelle.
The addition of each CH2 group in the hydrophobic tail also resulted in a decrease
of approximately ×2 in the CMC values.
Valls et al. also reported a decrease in the CMC value of the synthesized
palladium complexes in comparison to the corresponding amphiphilic phosphine
ligands R-(C6H4)(OCH2CH2)nP(Ph)CH2CH2SO3-Na (R = tert-octyl, n = 1.4, 5.1,
11.2; R = n-nonyl, n = 1.6, 5.6, 11.4) and RP(Ph)CH2CH2SO3Na (R = n-octyl,
CH3(OCH2CH2)3) by at least one order of magnitude (Table 2.1) [7]. Structural
comparison between the synthesized Pd(II) complexes and gemini surfactants
suggests that the palladium metal tends to act as a spacer between the two ligand
molecules similar to the structure of conventional gemini surfactants, where two
surfactants are linked by a spacer group and possess lower CMC values than the
conventional surfactants. The values of area occupied per molecule in the interface
were found to vary with the hydrophobic character, i.e. the palladium surfactants

had higher adsorbed area per molecule in general owing to the more hydrophobic
character. Comparing the structure of all the complexes, it was determined that
the highly ethoxylated chains lead to larger separation between the hydrophobic
chains, preventing the possible hydrophobic interactions required for compactness
of the adsorbed complexes. Palladium complexes with ligands 8 and 11 as shown in
Table 2.1 having moderate ethoxylation were more tightly packed at the water/air
interface than those with ligands 9 and 12, which are more ethoxylated, as indicated
by the smaller Å2 values, resulting in a higher concentration of the metal at the
interface.
Quite interestingly, ligand 14 without a polyether chain in the structure shows
a remarkably different behavior with the highest CMC value among the rest again
attributed to the lesser hydrophobic character.
Kanappan Santhakumar’s group has also been very actively involved in
synthesizing and assessing the surface-active properties of metallosurfactants
with metal serving as a part of the hydrophilic head group having the general
structure as shown in Scheme 2.1. The complexes generated were of the type
cis-α-[Cr(trien)AX](ClO4)2, (X = F, Cl, Br; A = dodecyl/cetylamine), and these
chromium(III)–surfactant complexes formed a coordinate bond between the head
group and the hydrophobic tail resulting in a higher charge on the head group
unlike conventional surfactant systems [9]. Their CMC values are lower in general
compared to the conventional organic surfactants from which they are synthesized,
i.e. dodecylammonium chloride (CMC = 1.5 × 10−2 mol dm−3) when compared to
the values given in Table 2.2.

The effect of changing temperature and counter ions on the CMC was also eval-
uated. CMC increased with increasing temperature pertaining to two competitive
effects: firstly, a decrease in hydration of the hydrophilic group, favoring micelliza-
tion and, secondly, disruption of the water surrounding the hydrophobic group,
which retards micellization. The change in counter ions from F−to Br−decreased
the CMC owing to an increase in the size of ion present in the coordination sphere,
making it more weakly hydrated and hence, readily adsorbed on the micellar sur-
face. This decreases the charge repulsion between the polar groups and facilitates

micellization. With the increase in the alkyl chain from dodecylamine to cetylamine
on the polar head group, the CMC again shows a decrease due to an increase in
hydrophobic character of the molecule in the coordination sphere. Thermodynam-
ics of micellization further delivers valuable information on the head group and
hydrophobic chain interactions taking place. The more negative ΔG∘
mic values
with increasing head group polarity indicate more favored micellization, while the
negative values of ΔH∘
mic depict exothermic nature of micellization suggesting the
presence of London-dispersion forces in micelle formation. The positive values of
ΔS∘
mic reveal that the micellization is governed mainly by hydrophobic interactions
between the surfactant cations resulting in the breakdown of the structured water
surrounding the hydrophobic groups indicating that the micellization process is
entropy driven confirming that increasing head group polarity favors micellization.
Of all the surfactants synthesized, the type cis-α[Cr(trien)(C12H25NH2)X]2+ (where
trien = triethylenetetramine; X = F−, Cl−, Br−) was also studied in various solvents
such as n-alcohol and formamide at different temperatures [10]. Addition of alcohol
leads to an increased penetration of formamide into the micellar interface and,
consequently, a decrease in the CMC was registered for long-chain alcohols, i.e.
n-propanol, n-butanol, n-pentanol, and n-hexanol due to this. The observations
are considered an outcome of increased hydrophobic effect/solvophobic interac-
tions, decreasing dielectric constant of the medium affecting interaction between
polar group and medium, and increasing chain length of the alcohols. Exactly
similar results were obtained when investigating Cr(III) complexes of the type
cis-α-[Cr(trien)(C16H33NH2)X]2+ (where trien = triethylenetetramine; X = F−, Cl−,
Br−) in n-alcohol and formamide at different temperatures. [11] Studies also revealed
that the metallosurfactant systems could be further expanded by using other chelat-
ing agents such as 2,2-bipyridine (bpy) and 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) [12], and it
works wonderfully by just changing the metal ion to cobalt as well [13, 14].
Wagay et al. investigated similar metallosurfactants or the ones with quite
similar design, i.e. [Co(en)2(C12H25NH2)Cl](NO3)2 cis-chlorobis(ethylenediamine)
dodecylaminecobalt(III) nitrate (CDCN) with a CMC of 1.4 mmol kg−1, which is

quite low compared to the conventional surfactants owing to a reduction in the
hydrophilicity of the head group ascribed to the presence of additional carbon
atoms. The adsorption studies confirm A value to be 0.64 nm2 and surface area
of the bare CDCN head group as 0.14 nm2, which suggests hydrogen bonding
of the head group to water and electrostatic repulsion between the headgroups.
Interestingly, a decrease in CMC was also registered upon substitution of nitro
by chloride group in the coordination sphere of Co(III) [15]. In another report,
the
surfactant
chlorobis(ethylenediamine)dodecylaminecobalt(III)
perchlorate
(cis-[Co(en)2(C12H25NH2)Cl](ClO4)2, (CDCP) prepared by Santhakumar et al. [16]
was evaluated for adsorption and counter ion binding properties [17]. CDCP and
CDCN have the same head group and γCMC values (27.0 mN m−1), but still the CMC
of CDCP (3.99 mM) is higher than that of CDCN (1.40 mM), which confirms that
the CMCs of metallosurfactants with perchlorate and nitrate counter ions do not
follow the trend as predicted by the positions of counter ions in the Hofmeister
series. Therefore, binding of counter ions to the head groups of metallosurfactants at
the micelle/solution interface is not fully controlled by the chaotropy/kosmotropy
of the counter ions. This is also corroborated by the surface excess values of CDCP
and CDCN, as the Gmax of CDCP (2.2 μmol m−2) is lower than that of CDCN
(2.4 μmol m−2); hence, perchlorate counter ion pushes less monomers of the
metallosurfactant to the air/solution interface than nitrate counter ion. Thus, the
presence of metal ion, higher electrical charge, and ethylene groups (hydrophobic-
ity) in the head group also play a significant role in micellization process. The value
of 𝛽determined is 0.8, which reveals that the number of counter ions binding to a
micelle. Since the head groups have a + 2 charge and the counter ions have a −1
charge, only 40% of micellar charge is neutralized by counter ion binding and the
remaining 60% of the charge remains present on the metallomicelle. Hence, it can
be inferred that the metal ion can lead to a significant change in the micellization
process when present in the head group area by decreasing hydrophilicity and
increasing hydrophobic interactions.
Type II Complexes: Metal Ion as Part of the Counter Ion Alkyl ammonium halides
come across as excellent candidates to evaluate the effect of coordination of metals
as counter ions in a metallosurfactant system. The quaternary ammonium group
(CnQAB) usually acts as the cationic surfactant with a metal entity as the counter
ion. Keeping this in mind, Sharma et al. synthesized a series of supramolecular
metallosurfactants with the formula: [PtCl4]2−[CnTA]2
+, varying the alkyl chain
with different values of n = 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 and analyzed their effect on hydropho-
bicity, CMC, and various thermodynamic parameters [18]. The interplay between
the ability of the metal ion to affect electrons and the length of the hydrophobic
alkyl chains is responsible for a change in the CMC values, which are found to
be lower for the metal complexes as compared to the conventional surfactants.
Increasing alkyl chain length for the series results in a decrease in the CMC
values as- (C22H52Cl4N2Pt – 0.400 mM) < (C26H60Cl4N2Pt – 0.372 mM) < (C30H68
Cl4N2Pt −0.343 mM) < (C34H76Cl4N2Pt – 0.332 mM) < (C38H84Cl4N2Pt – 0.315 mM),
attributed to an increased hydrophobic character. Weaker hydrophilic interactions

and higher hydrophobicity induce a structured water effect and rearrange
micellization at a lower concentration. The thermodynamic parameters calculated
ΔG∘
mic, ΔH∘
mic, and ΔS∘
mic help understand the micellization behavior with
negative ΔG∘
mic values indicating the spontaneity of micelle formation for the
metal complexes and a decrease in the ΔG∘
mic compared to CnTAB attributed to
the linkage between [PtCl4]2−and [CnTA]+. The negative values of ΔH∘
mic predict
an exothermic reaction due to the energy released by the disruption of the metal
complex aggregate structures being held together by binding forces such as Van
der Waals and London-dispersion forces upon micellization. Quite remarkably,
ΔS∘
mic showed negative values and unfavorable entropic changes, which could
possibly be due to several factors, including the formation of solid-phase aggregates,
less pronounced disordering of water molecules, or more hydrated head group
compared to hydrophobic tail. In another study, biscetylpyridiniumtetrachloro-
platinate (Pt-CPC) metallosurfactant was synthesized, keeping the counter ion
same as [PtCl4]2−but changing the cationic surfactant to cetylpyridinium chloride
(CPC) [19]. The ionic bond between the two oppositely charged units coordinated
into a quasi-1-D structure. As summarized in Table 2.3, the CMC is lower and
ΔG∘
mic values more negative for Pt-CPC than CPC depicting the spontaneity of
micellization, whereas the negative ΔS∘
mic for Pt-CPC illustrates unfavorable
entropic changes for micellization. Therefore, the micellization process ensues with
an interaction of both ΔH∘
mic and ΔS∘
mic.
Wagay et al. also synthesized metallosurfactants with metal in the counter
ion moiety, i.e. tetradecylpyridinium (TP)-based metallosurfactants, TP2[MCl4]
(M = Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) [20]. The adsorption and aggregation properties of
these surfactants revealed a decrease in CMC value (1.116–1.137 mmol kg−1) by
coordinating metal to the counter ion when compared to a conventional surfactant.
CMC also exhibits a decrease with increasing hydrocarbon chain length, but the
extent of decrease in CMC per CH2 group increase becomes less pronounced in the
presence of metal ion. Metal ion also causes a reduction in the counter ion binding
constant (0.33–0.35) by almost 50%, although the surface parameters registered are
more or less the same with surface excess values varying from 0.64 to 0.68 μmol m−2
and the A values ranging between 2.45 to 2.59 nm2.
Similar type of metallosurfactants, i.e. [M(CH3COO)4] [C12H25NH3]2, have been
investigated by our group keeping the hydrophobic dodecyl chain same and just
varying the metal ion M as cobalt, iron, and zinc [21]. The metallosurfactants
dissociate into surface-active molecules and ions upon dissolution in water, i.e. the
ammonium head group along with dodecyl chain and the counter ion with metal.

2.2 Micellization and Surface Parameters
31
The ΔG∘
mic values for the metal surfactant complexes were negative, indicating
spontaneous and thermodynamically favored micellization process. Convention-
ally, for amphoteric and ionic surfactants, ΔG∘
mic values range between −23 and
−42 kJ mol−1 at 298.15 K, and the free energy values for the metal surfactant
complexes show classical surfactant behavior, with the negative ΔG∘
mic as 34.11,
30.09, and 32.40 kJ mol−1 for Zn, Co, and Fe, respectively. ΔS∘
mic values obtained
were negative for these metallosurfactants as well indicating head groups were
more restricted in the micelle, and the surface formed by the surfactants became
more ordered with micellization. The micellization process was therefore overall
enthalpy driven, and the thermodynamics of micelle formation were governed
by hydrogen bonding and Van der Waals interactions. An interesting observation
was that CMC values varied with the change in metal ion, following the order:
Zn (0.25 mM) < Fe (0.80 mM) < Co (0.85 mM) for different metals. This was due to
an interplay of metal ion size as well as ionic character as the CMC values were
found to increase with the hydrated metal ion size in general. In another report, a
copper surfactant complex [Cu(BrCl2)(C12H25N(CH3)3)] was synthesized, and its
aggregation behavior and adsorption pattern was evaluated revealing important
information about the molecular organization and counter ion distribution at
the interface and in bulk of the solution. The X-ray absorption fine structure
technique was applied to the copper surfactant solution under both total reflection
(total-reflection X-ray absorption fine structure [TRXAFS]) and transmission con-
ditions wherein the Br and Cu K-edge absorption demonstrated the presence of Br−
ions and the absence of Cu2+ ions at the interface and in the inner core of micelles
(Figure 2.3). Metallosurfactant dissociated, and the surfactant ion, Cl−and Br−ions
occupied the interface while the copper cation went into the bulk, evident by the
absence of a copper ion peak in X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectrum
and the negative surface density of copper at the air–water interface. Furthermore,
Br−ions existed in two solvation states, designated as “free-Br” and “bound-Br”
with generally bound-Br state at the interface forming ion pairs. The study helped
to develop an understanding of the ion organization at the interface and in the
bulk. The presence of metal in the counter ion indeed affects the micellization
process and quite remarkably resulted in negative entropy values suggesting that
the process remains enthalpy driven.
Type III Complexes: Metal Ion as Part of the Hydrophobic Chain The research group of
Prof. Suades has done pioneering work in this area working with a family of linear
surfactant phosphines Ph2P(CH2)nSO3Na (1(a–c)) and utilizing them to synthesize
metallosurfactants by reacting with metal moieties such as PtCl4, [Mo(CO)5], and
[Mo(CO)4] (Table 2.4) [22, 23]. Quite interestingly, the metal moiety is bonded to the
phosphorus atom at the end of the hydrocarbon chain generating the hydrophobic
part, and the polar head group consists of the –SO3Na moiety, using the organometal-
lic approach. The study employs three different phosphine ligands with an otherwise
similar structure but just the change in the number of carbon atoms. The CMC
value of the metallosurfactants gets considerably reduced after the coordination of
surfactant phosphine ligand to the rigid non-polar metal group ascribed to (i) the

structural similarity between the synthesized surfactants and gemini surfactants or
bolamphiphiles, which are less efficient at reducing surface tension [24]. (ii) increase
in the hydrophobicity because of the addition of the lipophilic fragments such as
[Mo(CO)5].
Not much difference in the values of A is observed for phosphines (1(a–c)) assum-
ing a similar packing for all the aggregates with the hydrophilic sulfonate group
oriented toward water and the lipophilic (CH2)n-PPh2 group oriented toward air in
an extended chain conformation. However, the values are quite different for pen-
tacarbonyl (2(a–c)) and tetracarbonyl (3(a–c)) complexes, thanks to the existence
of the voluminous hydrophobic metal carbonyl group. With an increment in the
chain length of the complexes and the cross-sectional area of the hydrophobic part
of the molecules, a progressive decrease in the molecular packing is also registered.
Going from 3(b) to 3(c), there is a large increment in the value of A consistent with a
double-loop conformation of the complex at the interface as depicted in Scheme 2.2
below [25].
In another study for the cis-[PtCl2L2] (4(a–c)) complexes, CMC values are substan-
tially reduced by a factor of 5 for 4(a,b) and nearly 10 for4 (c), which is comparable
to the behavior shown by bolaform surfactants (Table 2.4). Hence, comparing
the structure of 4(a–c) with gemini surfactants, PtCl2 fragment acts essentially

as a linker or spacer between the two hydrophobic chains, like bolaform/gemini
surfactants. The results evidence that A value for platinum complexes is markedly
higher than those of ligands L1–L3, which is in fact similar to the organic bolaform
disulfonate behavior displaying larger areas than conventional monomeric sul-
fonates. Quite remarkably, the area per molecule occupied by 4(c) is substantially
larger than 4(a) and 4(b), which points toward a different packing and structural
organization specifically, a double-loop conformation. This organization is further
stabilized by the presence of hydrogen bonds between the chlorine atoms bonded
to the metal and water molecules. Therefore, the metal present as a part of the
hydrophobic chain essentially leads to the formation of structures identical to
gemini surfactants, and the thermodynamic parameters obtained follow a similar
pattern as well.
2.3
Adsorption of Surfactant Monolayers
In addition to the usual micellization and aggregate formation in the bulk, surfac-
tants tend to adsorb and form monolayers at the air water interface. Sometimes,
aggregates are also observed at the air water interface, and it is worthwhile to look at
the adsorption layer formed by metallosurfactants. After the surfactant adsorption,
the monolayer formed at the interface can easily get transferred to a solid support
yielding the Langmuir Blodgett (LB) films with a vertical dipping and Langmuir
Schaefer (LS) films with a horizontal dip in the liquid. With each immersion, a
uniform monolayer with a very accurate thickness is homogeneously adsorbed on
the solid substrate. The monolayer formation and metallosurfactant adsorption at
the interface also govern the surface tension behavior. The surface solutions of some
[Ru(bipy)2(bipy′)][Cl]2 complexes where (bipy′) = 5,5′-dialkyl-2,2′-bipyridine have
been investigated to disclose some interesting aggregation and surface behavior by
visualizing them to be structurally equivalent to gemini surfactants. The surface
of aqueous solutions of [Ru(bipy)3][Cl]2-based double-chained surfactants has
been studied using neutron reflectometry, and it is observed that for shorter chain
lengths, i.e. Ru2
5C13 (n = 13) (CMC = 0.30 mmol dm−3), studied in the range
0.01–1 mmol dm−3, the surfactant adsorption takes place relatively quickly showing
a maximum surface coverage of 100 Å2 molecule−1. It is comparable to the expected
headgroup area of the molecule 95 Å2 and A value from surface tension, i.e. 110 Å2.
However, for longer chains with n = 19, i.e. Ru2
5C19 (CMC = 0.03 mmol dm−3),
studied in the range 0.3–0.03 mmol dm−3 strong time dependence of adsorption is
observed with solutions taking up to 12 hours to attain an equilibrium surface layer,
arising from slow adsorption rate pertaining to alkyl chain length and diffusion lim-
ited adsorption rather than low monomer concentration. The structure obtained at
the air solution interface is quite dissimilar to the interface of micelle with the solu-
tion. Also, the area per molecule values reveals that the adsorbed film possesses more
than one headgroup per nominal adsorption site; and for concentrations c > CMC
two headgroups per nominal adsorption site exist for each monolayer adsorption
suggesting a more complex and highly corrugated surface structure [26, 27].

https://www.twirpx.org & http://chemistry-chemists.com
2.3 Adsorption of Surfactant Monolayers
35
The group has further extended their studies to check the effect of alkyl chain
length and its orientation on the structure of adsorbed films [28]. The surface behav-
ior of a range of Rup
qCn metallosurfactants has been reported as a function of p,
substitution on bipyridine ligand (4 or 5), and q, number of substituted alkyl chains
(1 or 2) for n = 19. The adsorption of the single-chain Ru1
4C19 and Ru1
5C19 sur-
factants is very slow and strongly time-dependent, taking more than 10 hours to
form equilibrium films, which is probably related to the alkyl chain length rather
than the low solution monomer concentration. Below the CMC, Ru1
5C19 film is
denser compared to Ru1
4C19, whereas at concentrations close to and greater than
CMC the inverse takes place. Close to the CMC, the average area per molecule in
the adsorbed film (30 Å2) is significantly lower than the nominal headgroup area of
the surfactants (100 Å2) by approximately a factor of 3, which implies that the surface
aggregates might be the adsorbing units in this case. Although as discussed above,
the adsorption of the double-chain surfactant Ru2
4C19 is weak and independent of
time attributed to the orientation of the alkyl chains.
Carmona et al. formed mixed Langmuir monolayers employing the cationic met-

(Ir-complex)
and
the
anionic
tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin

The homogeneous monolayer was formed using the TSPP molecules attached
electrostatically underneath the amphiphilic Ir-complex matrix from low to high
surface pressures. J-aggregates were formed by TSPP and Ir-complex molecules.
Similarly, Langmuir monolayers containing the pure Ir-complex were also prepared
for comparison. Finally, Langmuir–Schaefer (LS) films have been obtained here
by successful transfer of the Ir-complex: TSPP (4 : 1) monolayers onto quartz
substrates. Gonawala et al. assessed the amphiphilic properties of salophen-based
metallosurfactants – [FeIII(LN2O2)Cl] and [ZnII(LN2O2)H2O], using Brewster angle

Conclusions
The adsorption and micellization behavior of metallosurfactants at the interfaces
and in the bulk solution is vital to the designing of various hybrid surfactant mate-
rials keeping in view their potential applications. Given the flexibility proffered by
metallosurfactants in terms of molecular design, it is pertinent to investigate the
micellization and surface parameters to modify the architecture of these surfactants
such as the head group size, hydrophobic chain length, and orientation as desired.
Micellization and thermodynamic parameters evaluated for the metallosurfactants
confirm that the nature and placement of metal ion, in the hydrophobic chain, head
group, or counter ion area impact the micellization characteristics as well by chang-
ing the hydrophobic character, hydrophilic nature, and polarity of the head groups.
In general, all the metallosurfactants show a decreased CMC value and increase in
micellization compared to conventional surfactants, which can be further fine-tuned
depending upon the properties required. Also, the adsorbed surfactant films on the
air water interface especially incorporated with the metal ion can be further used
to create LS films and LB films on a solid substrate for numerous prospective uses,
which opens a whole new world of applications. This is definitely one subject area of
metallosurfactants, which needs to be investigated further and can be successfully
employed to get tailor-made surfactants.

Introduction
Metallosurfactants form the most intriguing class of surfactant family engaging the
metallic and amphiphilic features in one single entity. Metallosurfactants were first
discovered by Satake et al. in 1962 who synthesized bivalent metal alkyl sulfates
and analyzed their micellar properties [1], while the actual reference to the term
“metallosurfactant (MS)” or “metallomicelles” did not surface until the 1990s [2,
3]. Metallosurfactants are composed of metal ions, which are usually the transi-
tion metals linked, chelated, coordinated, or bonded to the ligands having primarily
an alkyl chain skeleton. Supramolecular aggregates of the metallosurfactants offer
great opportunity to researchers concentrating metal within the self-assemblies. As
a result, they find numerous prospective applications as sensory ensembles [4], cat-
alytic sites [5], magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents [6], nanoreac-
tors for nanoparticle fabrication [7, 8], drug-delivery vehicles [9], and molecular
machines for the formation of more complex hybrid materials such as porous silica
material and metallosomes [10]. These self-assembled structures are pretty impor-
tant and they have recently been used in fighting the deadly coronavirus/COVID
2019. Nanomicelles loaded with curcumin have been administered to coronavirus
disease of 2019 (COVID 19) patients, which acts as a therapeutic supplement [11]. In
another study by Alavi et al., various self-assembled aggregates have been decorated
with lecitin protein, which binds to the carbohydrate component of the virus and
emerges as a promising strategy for targeting the coronavirus [12]. Owing to the wide
application range, it becomes pertinent to look into the chemistry and morpholog-
ical details of the self-assembled metallomicellar structures formed and to identify
the positioning of metal and hydrophobic alkyl chain in the aggregates along with
other cations and anions. The basic idea of integrating a metal ion into the surfactant
molecule provides a facile means of localizing unique properties at the interface of
two regions, rendering the information quite useful to further explore their potential

applications. As a result, an attempt has been made in the present chapter to discuss
the range of self-assembled aggregates formed by the metallosurfactants, including
but not limited to micelles, reverse micelles, worm-like micelles, vesicles, bilayers,
and lamellar structures in the first section. The second part has been devoted to elab-
orate the applicability and role of these self-assembly structures towards different
natures of catalysis.
3.2
Self-Aggregation Behavior
The metal surfactant complexes or metallosurfactants show conventional surfac-
tant behavior as they have an inherent tendency for aggregation. These surfactants
act in a similar fashion by reducing surface tension of water and self-assembling
to form various micellar morphologies depending primarily on the type of ligands
attached and the head group, which will be examined in this chapter. Pileni and
group were among the very first researchers to work extensively on metal–sodium
bis(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate (AOT) surfactants and chalk out a phase diagram
for Cu(AOT)2 surfactants depicting various colloidal structures. They showed the
complete evolution of structures from reverse micelles to bicontinuous systems first
by the generation of interconnected cylinders followed subsequently by a lamellar
phase [13–16]. It becomes really important to look into the self-assembly structures
as their structure greatly affects their applications. Kaur and Mehta illustrated that
the metallomicelles determined the morphology of the metal oxide nanostructures,
hence obtained [17]. The various self-aggregating assemblies possible for metallo-
surfactants have been discussed here.
3.2.1
Micelles
The simplest self-assembly structure possible is a micelle. Micelles are quite a
rage owing to the emergence of cult favorite “micellar water” in beauty indus-
try as well where micelles have been advertised as little balls of o/w, which
lift dirt and grime out of the skin like magnet. Griffiths et al. have investi-
gated these micelles in detail, actually “metallomicelles” in the present context
(Figure 3.1) using scattering techniques such as small-angle X-ray scatter-
ing (SAXS) and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) for two novel copper
metallosurfactants [18]. The effect of surfactant head-group structure on the
micelle morphology was determined by synthesizing two Cu(II) surfactants
by
reacting
the
ligands:
1-(2-hydroxytetradecyl)-1,4,7-triazacyclononane
and
1-(2-hydroxytetradecyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane with CuCl2⋅2H2O to afford
[CuII(1)(H2O)2]Cl2 and [CuII(2)]Cl2 surfactants depicted as [Cu(1)]Cl2 and
[Cu(2)]Cl2, respectively, in Figure 3.2.
The [CuII(1)(H2O)2]Cl2, micelles were found to be prolate ellipses, rod-like while
[CuII(2)]Cl2 micelles were consistent with an oblate ellipse, which was attributed
to a greater ionic character of [Cu(2)]Cl2 as compared to [Cu(1)(H2O)2]Cl2 resulting
in an increase in the degree of ellipticity, and the micelles becoming less disc-like

(oblate). Therefore, only a slight modification in the head group morphology
yielded a different micellar structure. Guerrero-Martinez et al. while working
on ruthenium and iridium metallosurfactants also revealed the formation of
similar micelles with both the metallosurfactants containing same hydropho-
bic unit, i.e. dialkylbipyridine, with 17 methylene units [19]. The two surfact-
ants bis(2,2′-bipyridine)(4,4′-diheptadecyl-2,2′-bipyridine)ruthenium(II) dichloride
and
bis[2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine](4,4′-diheptadecyl-2,2′-bipyridine)iridium
(III) chloride made up of analogous polar transition-metal complex headgroup and
hydrophobic tail resulted in no alteration toward micelle morphology. Very inter-
estingly, the two compounds readily formed mixed-aggregate systems exhibiting
excellent electronic energy transfer process from excited iridium complex to energy
acceptor ruthenium metallosurfactant as illustrated in Scheme 3.1.
Concomitantly, Taira et al. presented outstanding results on Pd and Pt amphiphilic
complexes obtained by a reaction of N-alkylbipyridinium [4,4′-bpy-N-(CH2)10
OC6H3-3,5-(OMe)2] [NO3] with [M(NO3)2(en)] (M = Pd, Pt) [20]. The double-tailed

an external agent, cyclodextrins in this case, could be exploited in future to control
micellar aggregation and functioning.
Even the diblock copolymers were found to exhibit micellization on com-
plexation with Ru metal [21]. The association behavior of two amphiphilic
metallo-supramolecular block copolymers designated with acronyms PS20-[Ru]-
PEO70 and PS20-[Ru]-PEO375 was investigated using the dynamic light scattering
(DLS) and cryo-TEM techniques.
The polymers consisted of a polystyrene (PS) block connected to a poly(ethylene
oxide) (PEO) block using a bis(terpyridine)ruthenium complex as the bridge;
hence, the name: PS20-[Ru]-PEOy, with the constant length of PS block about 20
units and the two PEOs with different molecular weight. The authors reported
two types of micellar populations: individual monodisperse spherical micelles
and small clusters of micelles formed by the metallo block copolymer. Cryo TEM
images revealed the formation of spherical micelles with a core–shell morphology
for the PS20-[Ru]-PEO375 with the external diameter of the core-shell micelles to be
35 nm, which is in good agreement with DLS results. On the other hand, covalent
PS22-b-PEO70 was found to form only individual micelles, but a clear image could
not be obtained for the PEO70 counterpart, which has been previously observed for
short block systems. It was also deduced that increasing the length of the PEO block
had no effect on the core dimension, but it just made the visualization using cryo
TEM more facile. Pileni and coworkers have done pioneering work on Cu(AOT)2
surfactants and demonstrated a variation in the shape of the water droplets after the
dissolution of surfactant in water, i.e. the surfactant solution with changes in water
content [22–24]. The ratio of water to surfactant was represented using a parameter
w, which is defined as w = [H2O]/[Cu(AOT)2]. Below w = 3, spherical droplets
were formed and on increasing w from 3 to 5, the droplets obtained were elongated
with a cylindrical shape. This gave an evidence of metallomicellar morphology
change with alteration in water content.
Koutsantonis and Nealon [25] presented an interesting report describing the
formation of wormlike micelles coexisting with or interconverting to vesicles for
copper and cobalt metallosurfactants derived from Cu(II) and Co(III) complexes
of a macrobicyclic hexamine (“cage”) (Figure 3.4). Vesicles are basically spherical
self-aggregates with hollow core enclosed by a shell made up of a bilayer of the
amphiphiles, which has been discussed later in the section. Cryo-TEM images
reveal a series of interesting structures formed for the Co surfactant. Although the
formation of cylindrical micelles is quite uncommon for triple-chain surfactants
with a single headgroup, the wormlike structures obtained were highly convoluted,
hundreds of nanometers in length, and showed a micellar diameter of c. (6 ± 1)
nm. At this concentration, vesicles with a spherical morphology ranging from 30
to 300 nm in size were found to be coexisting with the wormlike structures. Quite
intriguingly, the formation of wormlike micelles is highly unexpected because the
presence of such a large charge on the headgroup (+3) should cause electrostatic
repulsion and destabilization of the micellar structures. But the authors proceed
with caution and attribute the wormlike micelle formation to the existence of
directional attractive forces in the headgroup region as well as a lack of complete

fluidity of the alkyl chains. Co(III)…Co(III) headgroups should have a large effec-
tive headgroup area expected due to heavy hydration, leading to the presence of the
cylindrical micelles. Also, the counterions, i.e. the acetate anions would be readily
localized within the headgroup region, owing to the extensive “H-bond chelation”
by the coordinated NH groups. The model assumes a fluidlike packing of the chains
in the interior of the micelle, thus leading to the formation of micelles. The authors
observe a super easy interconversion between the wormlike micelles and vesicles,
which might be attributed to a relatively low energy barrier between the two.
3.2.2
Inverted Micelles
Incidentally, a surfactant with small headgroup and voluminous hydrophobic
substituents leads to the formation of inverted micelles. In the case of metal-
losurfactants, Dom𝗂nguez-Gutierrez et al. became the first group to report the
formation of inverted aggregates from luminescent Ru surfactants [26]. The
[Ru(bpy)3−n(bpyRx)n]Cl2 complexes under study (n: 1 or 2), where bpyRx stands for
a 4,4′-dialkyl 2,2′-bipyridine ligand with x alkyl chains contains large headgroups,
so the formation of inverted aggregates is actually attributed to the hydrophobic
moieties, which are voluminous enough to counteract the effect of the large
headgroup. They extensively studied the effect of solvent polarity, rigidity, and
length of the alkyl chains in ligand on the self-aggregating structures formed and
drew remarkable conclusions regarding the same. The Ru surfactants aggregated in
apolar solvents into inverted micelles or inverted vesicles as determined by DLS and
atomic force microscopy (AFM) owing to the presence of numerous hydrophobic

tails converging into a cone geometry with the head group present in the narrow
extreme of the cone.
Five different Ru metallosurfactants (complexes 9–13) have been synthesized and
their self-aggregation investigated in detail by the authors as illustrated in Figure 3.5.
Complex 9 did not show any self-assembly in toluene, but rather resulted in inverted
vesicles (bilayers of complexes closing onto themselves, with the ruthenium groups
facing each other) showing a hydrodynamic radius (Rh) of about 64 nm in hexane.
Quite remarkable self-assembly process was observed for complexes 10 and 11.
While complex 11 did not form any self-assemblies in hexane or toluene in spite of
four large branched C9H19 hydrophobic chains, suggesting, that longer chains were
needed to solubilize the large [Ru(bpy)3]2+ head group. Solvent polarity exercised a
significant effect on the self-aggregating structures of complex 10. Inverted micelles
(Rh 3.7 nm) in 5 × 10−4 M hexane solutions and 100 times larger inverted vesicles
∼500 nm radius in 10−3 M toluene solutions were obtained due to the difference in
polarity of the solvents as the more polar toluene easily penetrated the interface of
the surfactant, resulting in larger structures. Furthermore, the individual micelles
obtained with a Rh of 3.7 nm were in agreement with the fully extended chain
conformation having a length of c. 3 nm corroborating the idea that the core of the
inverted micelles constituted of the divalent ruthenium headgroups in close contact
with each other, while the surface of micelles was formed by the hydrophobic tails
extending outwards. Also, the presence of some larger aggregates (Rh ∼32 nm)
could be a result of several small individual micelles coalescing. Comparing
complexes 9 and 10, it was concluded that the shorter chains in complex 9 (about
16 methylene groups per molecule less than complex 10) could not provide efficient
shielding to the headgroup, hence, the inverted vesicles formation with a larger
curvature instead of inverted micelles. Complex 12 self-assembled exclusively in
hexane solutions yielding spherical, monodisperse, inverted vesicles (Rh ∼38 nm)
primarily with a small population of micelles (∼3.5 nm). These structures are not
observed in case of more polar toluene-like solvents ascribed to the rigidity of the
ligand. Although the chains are long, they are not flexible enough to shield the

headgroup, which also hinders its arrangement into small inverted micelles even
though it should be favored. With a more flexible ligand, complex 13 is able to form
inverted vesicles in both hexane (∼49 nm) and toluene (∼57 nm).
3.2.3
Vesicles
Although there have been several examples depicting coexistence of micelles
and vesicles, Owen et al. wonderfully exemplified the transition from micelles
to vesicular structures with a change in coordination upon addition of different
metals [27, 28]. A microbially produced amphiphile, marinobactin E (ME), was
used to demonstrate the metal-induced transition from micelle to vesicle. The ferric
complex of the microbially produced amphiphiles led to micelle formation with a
diameter of ∼3.5 nm. These micelles experience a supramolecular transformation
upon the introduction of various metals such as Cd(II), Zn(II), excess Fe(III) or
La(III) to monodisperse vesicles with an average diameter ranging from ∼90 to
200 nm.
The marinobactins consist of an amino acid peptidic headgroup that coordinates
Fe(III) and the terminal carboxylate moieties in the Fe(III)-ME headgroups bridge
together on metal introduction, drawing them closer to give a vesicular arrangement
(Figure 3.6a). As revealed by the SANS and cryo-TEM data, a change in morphol-
ogy of Fe(III)-ME micelles to multilamellar vesicles (∼100–200 nm diameter) was
attributed to the ability of metals, i.e. Cd(II), Zn(II), and La(III) to form 2 : 1 lig-
and/metal coordination complexes. The resulting “composite surfactant” possessed
a lower headgroup-area/tail-volume ratio due to the formation of a cylindrical com-
posite with two alkyl chain tails favoring a vesicular arrangement instead of the
cone-shaped, monocephalic surfactant. X-ray diffraction (XRD) indicated the inter-
lamellar repeat distance of the Cd(II)- and Zn(II)-induced multilamellar vesicles to
be ∼5.3 nm, while the X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) spectra of these vesicles
confirmed the six-coordinate geometry of Fe(III).

3.2 Self-Aggregation Behavior
47
Consistent with the studies reported above, Suades and coworkers did some
remarkable work on the impact of Pt metal coordination in the formation of metal-
loaggregates [29]. The authors reported the formation of medium-size vesicles in the
first platinum(II) metallosurfactants of the type cis-[PtCl2L2] (where L = 1–3; and L
is the ligand from a new family of linear surfactant phosphines Ph2P(CH2)nSO3Na
{1 (n = 2), 2 (n = 6), and 3 (n = 10)}). The metallosurfactants synthesized by a reaction
between the phosphines and PtCl2 in dimethylsulfoxide resulted in the formation of
spherical disperse medium-size unilamellar, bilamellar, and multilamellar vesicles.
The same research group also synthesized a new set of molybdenum metallosur-
factants, i.e. molybdenum carbonyl surfactants with the metal atom being located
in a hydrophobic environment, as a neutral metal carbonyl (ligands remained the
same as described previously) instead of the usual polar head group, while the
polar head group in this case is a sulfonate linked to the phosphine ligand [30, 31].
Cryo-TEM microscopic image clearly confirmed the formation of vesicles. A wide
range of aggregates with slight morphological differences as illustrated in Figure 3.7
was obtained for the metallosurfactant 5, which includes small unilamellar vesicles
(diameters lower than 100 nm), large unilamellar vesicles (diameters higher than
100 nm), multilamellar vesicles (onion-like structure), and multivesicular vesicles
(smaller non-concentric spheres inside a larger vesicle). The membrane structure
or the wall of the vesicles obtained is actually metallic amphiphile bilayer and
resembled a classical lipid bilayer conformation, which could be visualized as
comprising organometallic fragments in place of hydrophobic chains. The metal is
found to be located in the hydrophobic group placed in the inner part of the bilayer
in the metallovesicle. Zha et al. applied this concept to rationalize the formation
of vesicles by a copper metallosurfactant [32]. Na2{Cu[CnH2n+1N(CH2COO)2]2},
where: n = 8, 12, 16 type of copper metallosurfactants were synthesized, which
spontaneously formed vesicles in water. As previously reported by Parera et al.

3 Metallosurfactant Self-Assembly
and Owen et al., metal Cu(II) coordinated to the carboxylic acid moieties present
in the surfactants’ headgroups neutralizing the electrostatic repulsion between
headgroups and drawing them closer together resulting in the formation of vesicles.
The vesicles formed by C12–Cu–C12 had an average size of ∼60 nm displaying good
stability over inorganic salt, temperature, and aging time. The data for different
metallosurfactants with varying alkyl chain lengths established that the surfactant
with longer chain length formed vesicles more readily. Similar behavior is observed
by Sommerdijk et al. [33] while investigating the self-aggregation of a two-headed
(dicephalic) surfactant. The complexation of surfactant molecules to copper(II)
sulfate at pH 5.5 and 9.5 values led to the generation of metalloaggregates of the
general-type Cu(imidazole)4
2+. Vesicles are formed at both the pH values; however,
the complexation is different due to the dicephalic nature of the surfactant. At pH
5.5, four imidazole groups from two surfactant molecules coordinate to one copper
center in a bidentate fashion, whereas at pH 9.5 a two-dimensional polymeric
network is formed in which each copper(II) ion is surrounded by four imidazole
groups from four different surfactant molecules. Electron microscopy revealed
large multilamellar vesicles with diameters of approximately 1000 nm at pH 5.5,
while at pH 9.5, extended bilayer structures were noticeable with a periodicity of
63 Å. Hence, a change in pH leads to a change in coordination of the complexes,
although vesicles are formed by both types of complexes.
As is the case with the formation of micelles and inverted micelles, reverse vesicles
can also be obtained by dissolution of metallosurfactant in apolar media. Dong and
Hao synthesized ferrum laurate [Fe(OOCC11H23)3] metallosurfactant, which could
successfully self-assemble into reverse vesicles in organic media such as pure CHCl3
and a mixed solvent of CHCl3 and CH3OH [34]. The metallosurfactant synthesized
is composed of three long alkyl tails leading to a strong shielding of the polar
headgroup in organic solvents, resulting in the formation of deformed solid reverse
vesicles, including collapsed erythrocyte-like and broken hollow shells. The size of
the aggregate structure was elucidated using the DLS techniques. Measurements
performed at three different scattering angles of 90∘, 60∘, and 45∘had no effect on
the hydrodynamic radius (Rh) validating the formation of spherically symmetric
aggregates. Rh had a fairly large size distribution, ranging from 30 to 260 nm.
Solvent-dependent aggregation behavior generating normal and reverse vesicles
was also studied. For this purpose, Mahato et al. employed a newly synthesized
symmetrical amphiphilic Ru(II)-polypyridyl complex with three –C18H37 chains
in equilateral positions [35]. The Ru(II)-polypyridyl hydrophilic head group was
present as the core and each bpy-ligand further functionalized with a hydrophobic
C18 hydrocarbon tail adopted a cone-shaped geometry and such cone-shaped
complexes are usually anticipated to form inverted micelles or vesicles in nonpolar
medium. Rather fascinatingly, this metallosurfactant formed both vesicles and
reverse vesicles depending upon the polarity of the solvent used, i.e. normal vesicles
in polar medium such as water and reverse vesicles in non-polar media like toluene
and cyclohexane – which is a unique observation (Scheme 3.2a). The comprehensive
DLS, static light scattering (SLS), AFM, and TEM data revealed the formation of
spherical, unilamellar, hollow vesicles where the vesicle membrane is essentially a

bilayer. The vesicle structures are formed by exposure of the apolar aliphatic chains
toward the apolar solvent medium environment, while the hydrophilic headgroup is
situated at the core of the bilayers facing each other. The DLS studies for the reverse
vesicles in toluene and cyclohexane indicate the mean diameter of the aggregates
to be 308 and 229 nm, respectively, while in the case of normal vesicles, the mean
diameter was found to be 230 nm. The solubility of the Ru metallosurfactant in
toluene was found to be higher as compared to cyclohexane, credited to the higher
polarity of toluene.
3.2.4
Lamellar Phases
The metallosurfactants are even capable of forming lyotropic liquid crystalline
structure aggregating to lamellar phase, which potentially consists of surfactant
molecules arranged in bilayers, which essentially mimics the lipid arrangement.

https://www.twirpx.org & http://chemistry-chemists.com

3 Metallosurfactant Self-Assembly
Each bilayer sheet is separated by layers of water. Taira et al. reported that Pd(II)
induced the formation of this type of lamellar phase in N-heterocyclic carbene
(NHC)-based metallosurfactant (MS), denoted as NHC-PdMS [36]. Pd metal
was located between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts of the NHC–PdMS
surfactant synthesized by stepwise ligand substitution reaction forming basically a
Pd–carbene bond. NEt3 used as a hemilabile co-ligand regulates the isomerization
step to get a single isomer of NHC–PdMS. Although the MS precursor, i.e. imida-
zolium bromide, forms spherical micelles, the coordination with Pd(II) in case of
NHC–PdMS results in self-assembly to larger aggregates, i.e. lamellar structure over
a wide concentration range (>26 wt%) as corroborated by the SAXS experiment.
Hence, we can safely conclude that the metallosurfactants are capable of form-
ing a myriad of self-assembly structures: micelles, inverse micelles, vesicles, reverse
vesicles, lamellar structures, bilayers, etc. They even display a transition between
various self-aggregating structures with varying metal coordination, solvent polar-
ity, and alkyl chain length. The capacity to regulate the self-assembling properties of
metallosurfactants can act as a useful tool for designing reactive interfaces.
3.3
Chemistry of Catalysis
Metallosurfactants offer innumerable advantages and applications over the con-
ventional surfactants and are rightfully termed as “next generation surfactants” by
Polarz et al. [37] owing to the presence of traditional surfactant moieties imparting
amphiphilic behavior and the unique metal ion imparting redox, catalytic, or
magnetic character to the molecule. The inclusion of metal into the amphiphile
led to strikingly organized self-assemblies decorated with active metal centers at
the interfaces – oil/water or air/water. Hence, it provided a wonderful opportunity
to work with, in a constrained environment and highly advantageous to pursue
their use as mini reactors for different type of reactions and catalytic processes.
Incorporation of various moieties within the self-assemblies is highly beneficial also
with regard to solubilization in both the aqueous and non-aqueous medium, which
can further be regulated to carry out the reactions in. This addresses and resolves
the persistent issue of reacting two moieties with different solvent compatibility. It
is highly desirable from the green chemistry viewpoint as it helps in minimizing the
use of harmful organic solvents and achieving higher yields with fewer byproducts.
The classic challenge in using metals for catalyzing organic reactions is the lack of
compatibility and dissolution of reactants in a single medium to successfully carry
out the reaction and at the same time extraction of the product. At this point, the
self-assemblies and interfaces can be really helpful to increase cooperativity and
allow diffusion of reactants. Phase transfer catalysts (PTC) having both hydrophilic
and hydrophobic components easily dissolve in either of the two phases and facili-
tate the migration of the reactant into a favorable common phase where reaction can
take place. While working with ionic reactants, PTC is an indispensable tool as the
reactants are more often than not insoluble in an organic phase and solubilize only

in polar media. The reaction rate can also be enhanced by forming micelles or emul-
sions resulting in a large interface of the immiscible phases. In the present section,
we will be discussing the catalytic activity shown by metallosurfactants, which is an
interplay of surfactant catalysis and transition metal catalysis wherein metallosur-
factant molecules self-assemble into various organized assemblies in solution and
act as efficient metal catalysts as well. Scarso and coworkers [38, 39] have excellently
reviewed the micellar catalytic activity highlighting the role of metallosurfactants,
while Bhattacharya and Kumari [40] focused their review on the ester hydrolysis
reactions using metallomicelles. Two major approaches to metal catalysis in micel-
lar media have been defined: (i) solubilization of metal within or at the micellar
surface (ii) using metallomicellar units. For the scope of this chapter, we will be
concentrating our studies in the latter area:
3.3.1
Micellar Catalysis
The reaction occurs in the metallomicelles, which have been employed as reaction
vessels as well as catalytic centers. Lipshutz et al. have done some really impressive
work in the field of “micellar catalysis” involving metals and surfactants [41, 42].
They very effectively carried out metal insertion into the established designer
surfactant systems yielding nanomicelles for catalytic reactions with the major
benefits of using water as the reaction media, product extraction with minimal
organic solvent, and in-flask catalyst recycling. Initially, both Grubbs–Hoveyda
(GH) 1 and 2 ruthenium carbene catalysts were covalently attached to the surfactant
polyethyleneglycol ubiquinol sebacate (PQS) for carrying out olefin metathesis reac-
tions within the spontaneous aqueous nanomicelles [43]. The catalyst-cum-reaction
center was efficiently utilized in the ring-closing metathesis of both mono- and
1,1-disubstituted olefin, and N-, S-, and O-containing lipophilic dienes leading
to the corresponding five-, six-, and seven-membered ring products. Taking cue,
PQS was again used as the platform for micellar catalysis as it self-aggregated into
nanomicelles, to which nonracemic 2,2′-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1′-binaphthyl
(BINAP) was covalently attached and rhodium(I) was inserted resulting in
“PQS-BINAP-Rh.” The “PQS-BINAP-Rh” species formed is the first example of
a nonracemically ligated transition metal catalyst-tethered amphiphile, utilized
for Rh-catalyzed asymmetric 1, 4 conjugate addition reactions of arylboronic
acids to acyclic and cyclic enones as depicted in Figure 3.8c [44]. As evident from
Figure 3.8a, PQS is a truly unique molecule as it has appendages to solubilize in
both organic and aqueous media and a handle to attach the catalyst as well making
it an indispensable tool for micellar catalysis.
Working on similar lines, Mintogaud and coworkers prepared another type,
surface active Hoveyda-type catalyst denoted as 2, 3 in Scheme 3.3, which catalyzed
both ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) and ring-closing metathesis
(RCM) in water with great efficiency [45]. These surfactants assembled into Lang-
muir monolayers at the air/water interface, which confirms the surface activity of
these complexes and the fact that the ruthenium moiety is polar enough to be close
to the water surface aiding catalysis. Ring-closing metathesis experiments were

of the micelles and the active catalyst site, i.e. [Ru] is in the hydrophilic part of the
micelle. Ring-opening metathesis polymerization was carried out using norbornene
and diester in this case, although both water-soluble and -insoluble monomers
could be envisioned. In each case, the initiator surf is present at the interface
between hydrophobic and hydrophilic media. For water-soluble monomers, a
dispersion polymerization could be envisaged, whereas for hydrophobic monomers,
a suspension polymerization (Scheme 3.3).
Further, channelizing the catalytic activity of Rh metal, Deng and coworkers

as-synthesized chiral surfactant-type Rh catalysts as depicted in Figure 3.9 with
excellent conversion rate (94%) and high enantiomeric excess (84%) [46, 47]. An
insight into the reaction mechanism of asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) of
octan-2-one with HCO2Na as hydrogen source in water was provided. The reaction
is proposed to occur in the metallomicelles with the micelle size of the catalyst
changing from 22.3 ± 5.7 nm to 66.8 ± 15.6 nm for the reaction mixture, due to the
incorporation of the reactant, i.e. ketone into the metallomicelles. Alkyl length of
aliphatic ketones greatly influenced the reactivity and enantioselectivity. Linear
alkyl methyl ketones show increased enantioselectivity from 76% to 94% ee with an
increase in alkyl chain length suggesting hydrophobic interactions between the long
alkyl group of aliphatic ketones and the long chain of catalyst in the metallomicelle.
Also, the positive charges on the polar head of the surfactants located at the
micellar surface elevate the concentration of hydrogen source, i.e. formate ions via
the electrostatic attraction, and result in the acceleration of reaction rate. It was
proposed that in the transition state, stereochemistry was controlled by the steric
interaction between the alkyl groups of the aliphatic ketone and the Cp* ligand of
the amphiphilic catalyst. Therefore, synergistic effects between the metal-catalyzed
center and the hydrophobic microenvironment of the metallomicelle core facilitate
the reduction, proceeding with high stereochemical induction. ATH of esters such
as methyl 2-oxodecanoate with different metal precursors and ligands was also
explored to gain an insight into the mechanism.
3.3.2
Vesicular Structures in Catalysis
Vesicles are among the most common type of self-organized structures formed by
the metallosurfactants and, hence, can be efficaciously exploited for performing
reactions. Uozumi and coworkers have been leading the research in pincer palla-
dium complexes and successfully utilized the self-organized structures primarily
formed, i.e. vesicles for catalytically driven processes [48]. Pincer complexes are
basically the coordination compounds obtained when chelating agents bind to

monoionic terdentate ligand or simply to three adjacent coplanar sites of a ligand
(referred to as pincer) in a meridional configuration. The researchers designed
amphiphilic pincer palladium complexes by decorating the planar palladium pincer
backbone with hydrophilic and hydrophobic side chains. The pincer palladium
complexes as illustrated in Table 3.1 have pairs of hydrophobic dodecyl chains
and hydrophilic triethylene glycol chains, located opposite to each another on
the rigid planar backbone. The vesicular structures were obtained by dissolution
of the pincer complex in 9 : 1 H2O to CH3CN ratio and concentrated at 80 ∘C
for six hours, to afford a pale yellow aqueous suspension, which was cooled
and centrifuged (4000 rpm, 15 minutes) to give nanoprecipitates. The dilution of
nanoprecipitates in water resulted in vesicle formation with an average diam-
eter of 463 nm for pincer complex A and average 550 nm for pincer complex
B where metal is Pd. The comprehensive AFM, TEM, and scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) analyses confirmed spherical, hollow morphologies with the
thickness of the vesicle membranes to be c. 6–7 nm, consistent with their bilayer
membranous structures exhibiting monomer lengths of c. 2.8 nm. The authors
explored the catalytic potential of the synthesized vesicles for a number of organic
reactions in water, including but not limited to (i) Miyaura–Michael reaction of
2-cyclohexene-1-one with sodium tetraphenylborate yielding arylated product
[50] (ii) cyclization of alkynoic acids with catalytic amount of triethylamine to
give the corresponding lactones (iii) the ring-opening reaction of vinyl epoxides,
cyclization of 5-[4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]pent-4-ynoic acid, lactonization of
5-(het)arylpent-4-ynoic acids, cyclization of 2-[(3-phenylprop-2-yn-1-yl)oxy]phenol,
[49], (iv) allylic arylation of (2E)-3-biphenyl-4-ylprop-2-en-1-yl acetate with sodium
tetraphenylborate, allylic substitution, or the Tsuji–Trost reaction, (v) hydro-
silylation of styrene and other related alkenes using dimethyl(phenyl)silane [52],
(vi) arylating oxirane ring-opening reactions of the vinylepoxide with phenyl-
boronic acid [51], (vii) the Miyaura–Michael reaction of cyclohexanone, with
sodium tetraphenylborate to give the arylated product.
A detailed structural analysis of the self-assembled palladium pincer complexes
points toward the formation of bilayer vesicles. Wide-angle X-ray scattering experi-
ments and atomistic molecular dynamics calculations form a powerful tool for the
structure elucidation of vesicles, which is important to map out the mechanism of
reaction taking place inside vesicles. The simulated bilayer structure revealed that
the membrane formed was relatively soft as compared to the normal phospholipid
bilayer membrane and the degree of alignment of the complex molecules was
low, which facilitates the movement of organic substrates or reactants through
the bilayer assemblage. Electron density profiles also confirm the presence of
space in the bilayer arrangement through which molecules can pass, hence, aiding
them to act as nanoreactors. In addition, the free energy of permeation of water
through the pincer complex bilayer membrane was much lower than the pure
phospholipid bilayer membrane, determined to be 12 kJ mol−1, which again results
in facile passage of organic molecules. The catalytically active center responsible
for the reaction is found to be close to the “free space,” which is easily accessible
to the organic molecules. Based on these results, a concept for the catalysis was

inferred (Scheme 3.4). The promotion of catalytic reaction inside the vesicular
structure is explained by the spontaneous concentration of the organic substrate
in the hydrophobic region as a result of hydrophobic interactions, where the
potentially catalytic metal species is located in immediate proximity. The organic
transformation proceeds rapidly as a result of the presence of high concentrations of
the organic substrate near the catalytic center [53]. During the reaction, the organic
substrates and the product are in a state of distribution equilibrium between the
hydrophobic region of the vesicle membrane and aqueous exterior.
3.3.3
Interfacial Catalysis
In addition to carrying out reactions within the self-assembled metallomicellar
units, interfacial catalysis was investigated with the possibility of regulating reac-
tions at the interface of two phases using metallosurfactants. Recently, Toth et al.
reported the interfacial catalysis in esterification of dilute acetic acid using the met-
allosurfactant Ni(DBSA)2 obtained by anionic surfactant 4-dodecylbenzenesulfonic
acid (4-DBSA) and divalent nickel ion, mimicking the two-phase Brust Schriffin
method (BSM) [54, 55]. BSM has been extensively used to carry out nanoparticle
synthesis employing tetraoctylammonium bromide as the phase-transfer catalyst
aiding the movement of chloroaurate ions from aqueous to organic phase followed
by phase separation and reduction to yield gold (Au) nanoparticles [56]. Engaging
a similar methodology, the synthesized catalytic surfactant system, i.e. Ni(DBSA)2,
has been utilized to carry out the esterification of dilute acetic acid with solvent
phase as 1-octanol, which resulted in octyl acetate in 31.3% yield, compared to 0.2%
in the uncatalyzed version. While the transition-metal ions such as Ni catalyzed
the esterification reactions, 4-DBSA was exploited for its ion-exchange capabil-
ity to regulate the surfactant properties with transition metal ions. A biphasic
(water–solvent) system is used where Ni(DBSA)2 dissolved in the solvent phase gets
self-assembled at the aqueous/solvent interface where the reaction takes place with
acetic acid being present in the aqueous phase (Figure 3.10). The catalyst-surfactant
system performs better as it lowers the interfacial tension between 1-octanol and
deionized water by up to 75%, increasing the mass transfer between different

phases. It was concluded that the Ni-based surfactant holds a great potential
for esterification reactions, with 1-octanol serving as a reactive solvent for the
esterification and extraction of carboxylic acid. As a result, biphasic esterification
enhanced by interfacial catalysis was observed using this metallosurfactant.
Going a step further, Kagalwala et al. led to solar hydrogen generation employ-
ing a microemulsion-based photocatalytic water reduction metallosurfactant
system [57]. Traditionally, the H2-evolving half-reaction, or water reduction, is a
light-driven process, proceeding by means of a photosensitizer (PS) and a water
(or proton)-reducing catalyst (WRC), with a sacrificial reductant (SR) substitut-
ing the oxidative half. Iridium- and rhodium-based metallosurfactants, namely
[Ir(ppy)2(dhpdbpy)]Cl and [Rh(dhpdbpy)2Cl2]Cl (where ppy = 2-phenylpyridine
and dhpdbpy = 4,4′-diheptadecyl-2,2′-bipyridine), were employed as photosensi-
tizer (PS) and WRC, respectively, along with oxalic acid as a sacrificial reductant or
electron donor in a toluene/water biphasic mixture. Before the onset of catalysis,
the metallosurfactants and oxalic acid were present in the organic and aqueous
phases, respectively. The microemulsion formation is proposed to be initiated by
the addition of 1-octylamine, which forms an in situ ion pair with oxalic acid
acting as an additional surfactant, bringing it in close proximity to the PS and WRC
making interactions with the metallosurfactants (present in the organic layer) more
favorable, assisting in the electron transfer and proton reduction. This is a great step
forward in the metalloamphiphile-based photocatalytic system, which generated H2
for ∼95 hours, highlighting its stability. Donner et al. highlighted the role of Cu(I)-
and Fe(II)-bearing NHC metallosurfactant in emulsion polymerizations under
atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) conditions [58]. The synthesized
systems served as all in one emulsifiers, active catalysts, and stabilization agents.
The metallosurfactant stabilized the water/methyl methacrylate (MMA) emulsion

forming aggregates with a size of the order of 100–110 nm per DLS and electron
microscopy studies. The microemulsion droplets define the loci of polymerization
and the site where polymerization takes place to yield stable poly(methyl methacry-
late) (PMMA) colloids in water with the catalyst located at the surface of the colloid.
The PMMA colloid chains terminated by bromine groups containing the copper
surfactant at the surfaces acted as macroinitiators for the copolymerization of
styrene. Surfactant is not able to migrate into the PS phase and remains bound at
the PMMA surface and occupies the PMMA–PS interface.
In another study, the same group successfully catalyzed the Suzuki coupling reac-
tion of phenylboronic acid with 4-bromoacetophenone using the micellar phases of
the Pd-NHC surfactant [59]. In a separate study, Taira et al. also evaluated the cat-
alytic activity of NHC–PdMS for aqueous Mizoroki–Heck reactions. Iodobenzene
reacted with styrene in the presence of NHC–PdMS (3 mol%) catalyst in dimethyl-
formamide (DMF), which formed an oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion. Vigorous stirring
of the emulsion at 70 ∘C for 24 hours afforded stilbene as the quantitative coupling
product [36].

Conclusions
Metallosurfactants indeed form the “next generation” of surfactants, which can be
designed to include specific features and characteristics in the molecule as desired.
The structural framework of the metallosurfactant can be fine tuned according to
the need and desired applications by varying the transition metal ion, alkyl chains,
or type of ligands attached. These surfactants give rise to various self-assembled
nanostructures at the interfaces and in the aqueous/non aqueous media such as
micelles, reverse micelles, vesicles, reverse vesicles, lamellae, and worm like and
are also capable of showing a transition in between these structures, which can be
successfully employed as nanoreactors or reaction vessels to carry out several reac-
tions. These surfactant-cum-catalyst molecules play a significant role in directing the
reactions at fluid and air/water interfaces with several advantages over conventional
systems such as carrying out reactions in aqueous media, facile in-flask recyclability
of catalyst, and product extraction with minimal organic solvent. Hence, the ratio-
nal designing and modification of metallosurfactants finds potential applications in
catalytic chemistry to conduct reactions, which otherwise would not be feasible.

Introduction
Metallosurfactants, as implied from the name itself, belong to special class of
surfactants in which a metal atom is present as an integral part of the surfactant
architecture. They form spherical nano-assembly and provide a perfect blend of
both amphiphilic character and surface activity [1]. Generally d- and f-block metal
complexes are incorporated to amphiphilic moiety, which supplies extraordinary
catalytic activity to it [2]. The metal atom is chelated to several structurally different
lipophilic ligands. The motivation of designing metallosurfactants originated from
outstanding catalytic action of metalloenzymes. Metalloenzymes are enzyme
proteins and responsible for many important biological reactions [3]. The skeletal
structure of metalloenzymes contains a metal ion; co-factor and enzyme/protein
[4]. Carboxypeptidase A is the best example of metalloenzyme with Zn2+ metal ion;
it hydrolyzes peptide bond. Hence, this class of surfactants mimics the functioning
action of enzyme active site and exhibits outstanding catalytic efficiency.
The metal complexes have several interesting features (like magnetic properties,
variable charge, and promising catalytic activity), which, after insertion into
amphiphilic moiety, are exhibited at interfaces [5]. The most fascinating aspect
of metallosurfactants is that it possesses similar number of complexation sites
with respect to its aggregation number in the micelles, hence proves useful in
various applications [6]. Figure 4.1 represents the comparative structural aspects
of a common surfactant and metallosurfactant with its types. Metallosurfactants
can be broadly classified into three types [7] (presented in Figure 4.1B1–B3). In
first type, metal ion with its coordinated sphere is present in hydrophilic head
group and hydrophobic part is represented by alkyl chain. In second class, metal
atom is situated in the hydrophobic alkyl chain part. The last classification involves

the presence of metal as counterion in the architecture of surfactant. The CMC
(critical micelle concentration) of metallosurfactants is very low as compared to
conventional surfactants, and their amphiphilic architecture forms a nanosized
assembly, which act as nanoreactor for several important biochemical reactions
[8]. Generally, the first class of metallosurfactants is applied as a catalyst to study
various esterolytic reactions.
4.2
Metallosurfactants as Nanocatalyst for Esterolytic
Reactions
Hydrolytic cleavage of various biologically important esters (carboxylate/phosphate)
is essential for several biochemical processes. In metallosurfactants, metal ions
(Figure 4.1B1) are endowed with ligands at polar head group to produce effective
chelated architecture. These surfactants imitate certain characteristic properties of
hydrolytic metalloenzymes upon aggregation in water. Generally, the metal ions
are present at the active site of metalloenzyme and coordinate with H2O molecule
[5, 6]. This results in increased acidity of bound H2O molecule by polarizing H—O

bond and thus further enhances the nucleophilicity. Thus, in metallomicelles,
metal ion acts as Lewis acid, which binds and activates C=O or P=O centers of
ester/amide/phosphate substrates. This in turn makes C atom of carbonyl group or
P atom of phosphoryl group more prone to nucleophilic attack. During the course of
hydrolysis, it further supplies the metal-bound HO−nucleophile to attack on C=O
or P=O centers of the substrates [5, 6]. The major benefit of such metalloaggregates
is that it can attract ionic substances and can fit in hydrophobic solutes too.
In past decades, extensive efforts have been made to investigate hydrolytic
cleavage of carboxylate and phosphate esters with different catalytic systems [9].
Chemical structure of some common esters has been presented in Figure 4.2.
The first hydrolytic metallosurfactant was reported by Gutsche and coworkers
in 1978 [10, 11]. The group studied hydrolytic cleavage of acetyl phosphate with
metal-chelated polyamine and polyamide micelles. In metallomicelles imidazole,
pyridine, trizole, crown ether, phenanthroline-based ligands are generally applied
with Cu2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, and Co2+ metal ions. Some f-block elements (lanthanum,
cerium, etc.) are also utilized in preparation of metallosurfactants.

Catalytic Hydrolysis of Carboxylate Esters
Metallosurfactants are broadly applied as catalysts to study various carboxylate
esters. In various metalloenzymes, imidazole attached to a histidine moiety is com-
monly noticed as a ligand of Zn2+ ion, which promotes enzyme-catalyzed reactions
[5]. Following this idea, several systems have been devised, which can exhibit
efficiency of both imidazole and OH- groups in the presence of Zn2+ ion. Tagaki
and coworkers [12] worked with the same motive and developed imidazole-based
ligands (1–7) (Figure 4.3) and incorporated them with Zn2+ metal ions to investigate
hydrolytic cleavage of PNPP; p-nitrophenyl picolinate. The group also prepared
a series with Cu2+ metal ions. Ligands 1 and 2 exhibited outstanding activity for
hydrolysis reaction. The observed result was obtained due to –OH group, which was

ability of 4 and 5 and observed 4 to be more potent.
The group [13] further investigated the co-micellar effect for Zn2+ and Cu2+
complexes formed with ligands 4–10 in the presence of various cationic, anionic, and
non-ionic surfactants. The observed rate constants indicate that hydrolytic cleavage
by Cu-4 was hundred times greater than Cu-6. Figure 4.4 displays the assumed selec-
tive activation of primary and secondary –OH groups of 8 to coordinate with Zn2+
and Cu2+ metal ions to participate in the hydrolytic cleavage. Benzimidazole-based
ligands (9 and 10) complexed with Zn2+ ion were also applied to study the break-
down of PNPP with co-micelles of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) [14].
In view of developing proficient catalytic systems, several modifications were
carried out and pyridine-based surfactant ligands were prepared. The contributions

of Tonellato and coworkers [15, 16] are considerable in this regard. They designed
and synthesized a series of structurally different pyridine-based ligands (Figure 4.5)
to investigate their hydrolytic strength against carboxylic esters in co-micellar
conditions.
The hydrolysis rate enhanced several times with the incorporation of metal ions
to pyridine surfactant ligands. Due to the presence of –OH group in ligand 11,
the generated metallomicelles were found to be more potent for hydrolysis than
12. Investigation also indicated the necessity of optimal chain length of ligand for
desired catalytic strength. The formation of ternary complexes (13 and 14) was also
suggested based on Job plots. The complex contains metal ion, ligand, and substrate
and plays the role of nucleophile. As a result, the increment in rate was recorded
[17, 18].
The co-micelles formed by CTAB and Cu-15a and Zn-15a demonstrated con-
siderable catalytic activity for the hydrolysis of PNPP. The methylated ligand
15b possessed least catalytic power as compared to 15a and 15c, which has no
hydrophobic chain. The authors suggested three steps for the hydrolytic mecha-
nisms. (i) The creation of a ternary complex between the substrate, metal ion, and
lipophilic ligand. (ii) The formation of transacylation intermediate and liberation of
p-nitrophenol due to the pseudo-intramolecular nucleophilic attack of the hydroxyl
ligand. (iii) The hydrolysis of intermediate by metal ion and regeneration of the
catalytic moiety [16, 19].

rate was observed for acidic medium than in neutral medium.

Phenanthroline-based novel ligands (Figure 4.6) were also reported by Engbersen
[21, 22] and team. Several metals were used for complexation in which 1 : 1 type
complex was formed with ligand 17a. The tendency of catalytic activity followed
the order – Zn2+ > Co2+ > Cd2+ > Ni2+. On the other hand, hydrolytic potency of
17b was found to be in 1 : 1 and 2 : 1 for complexation stoichiometry with Co2+ ion
[21]. The incorporation of imidazole ring resulted in the formation of 19 and 21,
which demonstrated appropriate potential to form comicelles with different surfac-
tants (like CTAB and Brij 35). Hence, it played a role of competent catalyst for the
hydrolysis of PNPP as compared to ligands 17, 18.
The assumed reaction mechanism for the hydrolytic breakdown of PNPP with
complex of Zn with ligand 20 is shown in Figure 4.7. In model A of Figure 4.7,
coordinated carbonyl oxygen is complexed with a transition metal ion and pro-
vided a smooth nucleophilic attack of free hydroxide anion. Model B displays the
coordination of Zn2+ ion with free hydroxide anion to encourage an intramolecular
nucleophilic attack.
Further, several macrocyclic metal complexes were also reported to study
esterolytic reactions. Kimura et al. [23] investigated the catalytic activity of
long-chain macrocyclic complex 22 toward the hydrolysis of PNPA. The ability
of 22a to form co-micelles with Triton X-100 exhibited ∼50 times greater activity
than that of the water-soluble Zn2+ complex of 22b. The Cu2+ complexes (23,
24) of lipophilic macrocyclic polyamines were developed by Griffiths et al. [24].
The authors studied the morphology of formation of aggregates by small-angle
neutron scattering (SANS) and small-angle-X-ray scattering (SAXS). Hughes and

A novel class of triazole-based ligand (26) has been reported by Qiu et al. [26] to
investigate the hydrolytic breakdown of PNPP in comiceller media of CTAB. The
ligand was coordinated with two metal ions Ni2+ and Cu2+ of which Cu2+ complex
displayed better catalytic action. Tendency of coordination and formation of ternary
complexes increased with lengthening of lipophilic tail.
Moreover, the group [27] employed this ligand with gemini surfactants
(C12H25-NMe2
+-(CH2)S-NMe2
+-C12H25, where S = 2,3,6), which resulted in
effective catalytic system for breakdown of PNPP. In addition, the authors have
also investigated the potency of ligand 27 for hydrolytic cleavage of PNPP in the
presence of gemini and single-chain conventional surfactants [28].

a more effective catalytic system than CTAB. In gemini micellar media, complex of

aza-crown group creates steric hindrance and blocks the active site in micellar media
for compound 31 and thus suppresses the hydrolysis rate.

Dinuclear copper complexes bridged with alkoxo/hydroxide moieties (32, 33) were
reported by Xu et al. [31]. The group further examined these complexes for hydrolytic
breakdown of PNPP in the co-micellar system of some conventional and gemini sur-
factants. The activity of dinuclear copper complexes toward the hydrolysis of ester
was fourfold higher than mononuclear copper complexes. The co-micelles of gemini
surfactants appreciably enhanced the rate of hydrolysis and exhibited better activity
than conventional CTAB. The proposed mechanism for breakdown of PNPP via met-
allosurfactant 33 in co-micellar medium of gemini surfactant is shown in Figure 4.8.

Catalytic Hydrolysis of Phosphate Esters
In view of biological significance of phosphate esters, a lot of studies [32] have been
carried out to understand the metallosurfactant-catalyzed breakdown of phosphate
esters. Phosphate esters also exist in the form of deleterious nerve agents and
pesticides. Hence, their catalytic breakdown into non-toxic molecules is highly
important. Gellman et al. first time reported metallosurfactant-catalyzed hydrolysis
of a triester PNPDPP; p-nitrophenyl diphenylphosphate in 1986 [33]. The authors
applied complex of Zn2+ ion with ligand 34 and identified it as an effective catalyst
at a little alkaline pH.
Menger et al. [34] prepared copper-based metallosurfactants with ligand 35 and
studied the hydrolytic breakdown of PNPDPP. The system displayed considerable
rate increment with significant turnover. Kimura et al. [23] reported a complex
36 of Zn with hexadecylcyclen and compared its catalytic ability with 34 against
the hydrolytic breakdown of TNP; tris (p-nitrophenyl) phosphate in comicelles of
Triton-X.

The rate increment in comicellar media is attributed to increased hydrophobicity of
substrate TNP, which facilitated smooth entry to micelles and nucleophilic attack of
36 to supply intramolecular hydrolysis. Generally, the catalytic efficiency of metal-
losurfactants is dissimilar for structurally dissimilar esters, i.e. a ligand may act as
a proficient catalyst for phosphate ester but may have poor catalytic activity for car-
boxylate or other esters. Scrimin et al. [17] verified this observation through their

The group has drawn a conclusion that the catalytic strength of metallosurfactants
is greatly affected by the type of ester. The breakdown of carboxylate ester was
supported by ligand 11d, which contained –OH group. The cleavage of PNPH was
insignificant by methylated ligands 37 and 12; on the other hand, ligand 37 has
shown superior reactivity against breakdown of PNPDPP. It was concluded from
the investigation that the presence of –OH group is imperative for the breakdown
of studied carboxylate esters but not for phosphate esters. Similar findings were
reported by Menger et al. [34, 35] and Morrow and Trogler [36] independently.
The ability of metallosurfactants for the hydrolysis of several different esters is
also dependent on their individual binding constants. The binding constants of
CH3COOCH3 with dipyridylamine complex of copper were determined by Chin
and Jubian [37] and lower affinity toward C=O center of carboxylate ester and
greater affinity toward center of phosphate ester was observed [38].
Scrimin et al. [39] also addressed the matter of different reactivity of metallosur-
factants using two complexes of copper in which copper was coordinated to ligand
38; tetramethyl ethylenediamine and 39; N-hexadecyl-N, N′, N′-trimethyl ethylene
diamine in co-micellar medium of CTANO3. They monitored comparative break-
down of different phosphate esters (di- and -trimesters) in the above-mentioned
medium.

The observed values of first-order rate constants were higher for copper com-
plexes with ligand 39 than 40. In case of second-order rate constants, Cu(II)
complexes of ligand 42 possessed greater values than ligand 39 and showed better
reactivity [40, 41].
Tecilla and coworkers [20] have reported pyridine aldoxime ligand 16 and studied
their complexes with Ni2+ and Zn2+ for the breakdown of PNPH and PNPA.
The group undertook this study in comicellar media of CTAB too. The observed
data indicated hydrolysis was pH dependent and found to be effective because of
increased concentration of substrate.
Contribution of Bhattacharya et al. [42, 43] for the synthesis of few 4,4′-
(dialkylamino) pyridine-based ligands (40–42) is worth mentioning. They investi-
gated catalytic ability of prepared ligands for hydrolytic cleavage of PNPDPP and
PNPH at pH 7.6. Slight rate enhancement was observed in comicellar medium of

Moreover, the team [44] undertook a comparative analysis to check the catalytic
power of ligands 43 and 44 (tetradentate) with that of ligands 48 and 49 (triden-
tate). The study reported modest rates with CTAB and without metal ion by ligand
44 for hydrolytic breakdown of PNPDPP and PNPH. However, remaining ligands
exhibited average rate enhancement for phosphate ester in CTAB medium. This
observation can be accounted on the basis of the participation of supernucleophilic
4-Dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) entity.

4 Hydrolytic Metallosurfactants: Nanocatalysts for Esterolytic Reactions
Jiang et al. developed several different ligands having pyridine moiety [45, 46]
and alkanol imidazole group [47]. Complexation of imidazole-based ligands (47, 48)
with copper, zinc, and nickel displayed excellent catalytic activity for the hydroly-
sis of BNPP: bis (p-nitrophenyl) phosphate. The observed rate increment was due to
lipophilic interaction, which raised the concentration of catalyst. The enhancement
in rate of reaction was due to hydrophobic interaction, which increased the local
concentration of catalyst. In between ligands 49 and 50, 49 was recognized as most
competent ligand.

The general observations obtained for both the pyridine- and imidazole-based
ligands were: (i) superior lipophilic interaction was recorded with micellar assem-
bly when longer hydrophobic chain was used and (ii) increased involvement in
lowering the activation energy barrier for hydrolytic cleavage of ester. The team
proposed a plausible reaction pathway through which the ternary complex formed
(Figure 4.10).
The octahedral geometry of metal–ligand complex stimulates hydroxyl group
with reduction in pKa and generation of Nu−nucleophile. Finally, the release
of p-nitrophenol (PNPOH) followed by formation of p-nitrophenyl phosphate
(NPP) in the subsequent step regenerated the catalyst [48]. The trend of catalytic
strength was in order of Cu2+ ∼Zn2+ > Co2+ ∼Ni2+. Complexes of ligands 51–53
were also studied in CTAB media for the breakdown of monoester NPP and diester
BNPP [46].

Complexes of crowned Schiff base ligands (54, 53) with manganese were applied
to examine the hydrolytic breakdown of BNPP in various comicellar media of
cationic, anionic, and gemini surfactants [49]. The comparative catalytic activity
of complexes was evaluated at pH 7.5. Observed rates were significantly affected
by structure of metal complexes and surfactants used. Gemini surfactants proved
to be best co-micellar medium for breakdown of ester, while complex of ligand 59
exhibited superior reactivity than complex of ligand 54.

Zn2+, and Co2+) and f-block metal ions (La3+). Further, a comparative study was
performed with ligand histamine; L1 to investigate their catalytic potency toward
the breakdown of BNPP at 35 ∘C and pH 7.0. The study recognized complex ML2 to
be more proficient for hydrolytic reaction than complex ML1.

4 Hydrolytic Metallosurfactants: Nanocatalysts for Esterolytic Reactions
Interestingly, the complex of f-block metal lanthanum LaL2 showed better ability
for hydrolysis than its complex with d-block metals. It is assumed that the break-
down of ester BNPP is governed by the construction of a ternary complex (presented
in 57) in which active hydroxyl group is attached. The breakdown pathway is demon-
strated in Figure 4.11.
Additionally, several lanthanide metal (Ce and La) complexes were reported
with aza-macrocyclic ligand 58 by Xie and co-workers[51]. The team investi-
gated the hydrolytic breakdown of BNPP with prepared metallosurfactants in
LSS n-lauryl sarcosine comicellar medium. The catalytic ability of LaL assembly
was less than that of CeL assembly. The finest catalytic strength for both the
metallosurfactant systems (CeL and LaL) was recorded at pH 8.0 and pH 8.2,
respectively.

Quantitative Treatment of Observed Rates:
Application of Kinetic Models
The quantitative treatment of observed rates for metallosurfactant-mediated
hydrolytic cleavage of esters is seldom documented but has great signifi-
cance in providing a general idea of nucleophilicity of Nu−against substrates.
Tagaki et al. [13] proposed a binary complex model for quantitative rate
treatment of some metallosurfactant-catalyzed reactions. The model assumes
metallosurfactant-catalyzed reactions as an intermolecular reaction in which weak
interaction occurs between metal ion and substrate as a ligand base in aqueous
buffer medium. A ternary complex kinetic model was proposed by Zeng et al. [52],
which suggests strong interaction between metal ion Mn+, ligand L, and substrate S
in a metallosurfactant-catalyzed reaction.
Another approach named as phase separation model (Scheme 4.1a) was proposed
particularly for micellar-catalyzed systems. It presumes the existence of two separate
phases in a micellar solution. One phase is micellar pseudophase and second is bulk
phase. However, it is proposed that the hydrolytic cleavage takes place concurrently
in both the phases with formation of the product (Scheme 4.1b).

(a) general scheme for partitioning of the reactants between the bulk phase
and the micellar phase. (b) Mathematical representation of phase separation model.
Here, Mi stands for micelle, S is for substrate, and Ks is the association constant.
Apparent rate constants for formation of product in both phases are denoted by km
for micellar phase and kw bulk phase. Usually, equilibrium exists between ligand
(L), metal ion (M), and substrate (S) in metallomicellar assembly.
In Scheme 4.1b, association constant KM shows association between metal ions x
and y ligands, KT is the association constant for interaction between binary complex
[MxLy] and substrate S. The apparent first-order rate constants k’N and k’0 denote the
formation of the product in metallomicellar phase and bulk phase, respectively. The
hydrolytic breakdown of substrates, i.e. ester in only buffer medium, is presented
by rate constant k0. Notations kL and kM correspond to second-order rate constants
for ligand and metal ion alone. The active concentrations of metal ion, ligand, and
substrate in bulk phase are symbolized by [M], [L], and [S]. [MxLy] illustrates the
concentration of x metal ion and y ligands in to bulk phase, and [MxLyS] demon-
strates the concentration of substrate in metallomicellar phase.

Thus, the quantitative rate treatment approaches have been effectively applied in
the form of binary complex model and ternary complex model [19, 25, 46, 53] to
metallomicellar catalysis. The foundation of such quantitative outcomes was based
on phase separation theory.

Conclusion
Hydrolytic metallosurfactants mimic the function of natural hydrolase enzymes.
Owing to this, noteworthy development of metallomicelles has already been docu-
mented and described. The motive of designing such hydrolase-based assembly was
to apply them effectively in catalytic cleavage of several esters, breakdown of lethal
phosphate esters, and in enantioselective catalysis. Many important investigations
have been conducted, which are reported in this chapter to address catalytic break-
down of C=O and P=O based esters. A number of developed surfactant ligands are
presented separately for carboxylate and phosphate esters. Several models, which
depict the quantitative treatment of observed rate data, are also discussed with
special emphasis. In spite of this, there exists a huge scope of developing hydrolytic
metallosurfactants with preferred reactivity and specificity.

Introduction
For the past few decades, metallosurfactants have been acting as an integral com-
ponent to enhance the physio-chemical properties of surfactant systems compared
to conventional surfactants in various ways [1]. The “metal ion” with hydrophobic
chain makes them eligible candidates for various catalytic reactions. Traditional
catalysis is carried out in organic solvents and, on the other hand, engineered
micelles help in catalysis reactions, using water as a solvent. In accordance with
green chemistry principles, the ideal solvent minimizes toxicity, energy demand,
and pollution. Among all the possible solvent systems considered, water, undoubt-
edly, is the best choice as green solvent. However, strong polarity of water makes it
least suitable solvent in organic reactions. To overcome this problem, surfactants
are employed in the system, which help in the solubilization of substrates in water.
In addition, the micellar aggregates of catalysts also facilitate their recycling and
further extraction of products. The field of micellar catalysis in water has been
extensively reviewed by Sorella et al. [2] and Lipshutz et al. [3]. Nonetheless,
metallosurfactants possess an added advantage here, as the metal itself acts as a
catalyst, along with retaining the surfactant properties. In water, metallosurfactant
forms the micelles, which have hydrophobic pockets at the center. When the organic
substrates are added, they tend to concentrate in those pockets, lying near to the
metal ion, which facilitates the reaction. Metallosurfactants are currently being
used for a number of organic reactions, including hydrogenation, oxidation, and
coupling reactions, which will be discussed in detail in the present chapter. The
esterolytic reactions involving metallosurfactants have already been presented in
Chapter 4.
Apart from synthetic chemistry, metallosurfactants are being used in various
energy-based applications. Nowadays, the unprecedented energy demands, due to
modernization in our lifestyle and industrialization, require exponential growth
in efforts to produce clean and green energy. At present, the increasing energy

5 Metallosurfactants as Catalysts in Organic Reactions and Energy-Based Applications
demands are fulfilled by excessive usage of non-renewable resources such as fossil
fuels. While utilizing these fossil fuels like coal, oil, natural gas, and coke, huge
number of harmful gases are also produced, which have devastating side effects
leading to serious environmental problems such as depletion of the earth crust
and environmental pollution [4, 5]. So, there is a challenge for the world leaders
to meet energy consumption demand and focus on the issue to provide clean and
renewable energy resources at low cost [6–8]. The current scenario is aimed towards
replacing the non-renewable energy resources with renewable materials and save
the environment from resource depletion and climate change challenges [9, 10].
One of the most promising methods to produce clean energy is by splitting water
into hydrogen and oxygen, either electrochemically or photochemically. Water
splitting is an eco-friendly and clean process to meet the energy problem [11] and
involves two half-cell reactions, i.e. hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen
evolution reaction (OER), which requires high overpotential and kinetic barriers
[12]. On the other hand, the production of oxygen through water splitting during
water electrolysis is a challenging process for energy storage and conversion as
it is not feasible both thermodynamically and kinetically because of the complex
charge transfer mechanism involved, which requires four-proton-coupled electron
transfer and O=O bond formation [13, 14]. This process of water electrolysis leads
to the generation of high-purity hydrogen and oxygen gas, which form the main
constituents of the fuels.
To counter all these issues associated with water electrolysis reaction and meet
up the high-scale requirements, the development of the advanced catalytic mate-
rial is highly sought after. The presence of an efficient electrocatalyst for lowering
these energy barriers during water oxidation is extremely important [15]. In case
of OER, Ru, Ir, and their oxides show higher electrocatalytic activity [16] and, in
case of HER, the use of noble metals like Pt and Pd fulfills the low kinetics and over
potential requirement [17]. However, the commercialization of these materials is
still a matter of concern because of their high cost, non-scalability due to their pre-
ciousness, scarcity, and instability with time in harsh conditions and less abundance
in the earth crust [18, 19]. In the recent years, a lot of research is going on for the
development of efficient electrocatalyst for water splitting to generate clean fuels and
rechargeable metal air batteries [20]. Therefore, to tackle these energy problems effi-
ciently, there is a need to develop efficient, durable, inexpensive, highly stable, and
high catalytic activity materials that can work efficiently in any harsh and adverse
conditions (acidic and alkaline solutions) for the catalysis and are more feasible than
noble metals [21, 22].
Nowadays, the transition metal-based group elements such as iron, cobalt, nickel,
and their oxides (perovskite [23], spinels [24], and oxyhydroxides and hydroxides
[25]), chalcogenides, nitrides, carbides, borides, metal alloys, and carbon-based cat-
alysts have been investigated as promising candidates for both photocatalysts and
electrocatalysts toward water oxidation. Their low cost, great abundance, excellent
chemical stability in broad pH range, resistance to corrosion, non-toxic nature, low
processing cost, and biodegradability lead to higher economic viability than pre-
cious metals [26, 27]. Further, various methodologies have been developed to address

the above-mentioned requirements for the development of the catalyst for water
electrolysis in the harsh conditions. According to various studies, the use of the sur-
factants results in the exfoliation process, which leads to increase in stability of the
dispersed material by preventing reaggregation and plays a role in monitoring the
surface charge [28–30]. This phenomenon can help to regulate the catalytic prop-
erties. Metallosurfactant-aided catalysis is an emerging field in the area of water
oxidation. The head group of a metallosurfactant usually contains the metal cation,
which offers a pathway for the transportation of ions and acts as a redox center
during catalytic performance. Therefore, the combination of the metal ion and the
surfactants gives a new segment of advanced material that can be used as an elec-
trocatalyst, which will be discussed in second part of this chapter.
5.2
Metallosurfactants as Catalysts in Organic Reactions
One of the initial reports of employing metallosurfactant in organic reaction was in
2009 by Lipshutz and Ghorai for ring-closing metathesis reaction in water at room
temperature [31]. A Grubbs Hoveyda 1 Ru(II) catalyst was prepared for lipophilic
dienes to form five- to seven-membered ring products. The reaction even worked in
seawater and thus proved to be an excellent example of using metallosurfactant in
organic reaction with excellent yield and recovery. Generally, a surfactant is com-
posed of hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts. Apart from these two parts, a third
component, which was free hydroxyl group, was present in this ruthenium surfac-
tant. The ability of free hydroxyl group in the hydrophobic core, linked covalently
with Ru carbine, is exploited to form nanomicelles in the organic reaction. The major
tenets of green chemistry were accomplished in this reaction as it was performed in
water, at room temperature, and the catalyst was continuously recycled without any
workup. It was further extended to Grubbs Hoveyda 2 Ru(II) catalyst for ring-closing
metathesis reaction of heterocyclics and carbocyclics [32]. Only 2% (w/w) of catalyst
was found to be efficient for acrylates and alkenes as well. Lipshutz and Ghorai gen-
erated a newfound interest in the organic catalytic transformations. Since then, there
have been several organic reactions catalyzed very efficiently and effectively using
metallosurfactants or metallomicelles, including, but not limited to – hydrogenation,
oxidation, C–C cross-coupling, hydration, epoxidation, sulfoxidation, etc. which are
discussed below. The esterolytic reactions have already been reviewed quite in detail
in Chapter 4 and will be excluded from the present chapter. Also, Chapter 3 reports
an in-depth analysis of self-aggregating metalloaggregates in enhancing the reaction
rate of organic transformations.
5.2.1
Types of Reactions
Metallomicellar catalysis can be categorized based on the type of reactions or met-
allosurfactants used. Going by the type of reactions, several groups have attempted
to investigate different metallosurfactants catalyzing a specific type of reaction.

5 Metallosurfactants as Catalysts in Organic Reactions and Energy-Based Applications
Transfer Hydrogenation Reaction
Transfer hydrogenation is a special class of hydrogenation reactions, which proceeds
with the addition of hydrogen employing hydrogen transfer catalysts using a source
other than gaseous hydrogen, which is quite expensive and inconvenient. A fine
example of catalysis of organic reaction in aqueous medium was demonstrated by Li
et al. with the help of an amphiphilic copolymer-based iridium catalyst for transfer
hydrogenation of aldehydes [33]. The aldehydes were reduced in water where the
emulsion droplets acted as microreactors. The catalyst, being amphiphilic, assem-
bled both organic and HCOO−moieties around active sites, which accelerated the
reaction and resulted in a turnover frequency of up to 3.0 × 105 h−1.
Kalsin et al. also investigated a similar hydrogenation reaction with a variety
of ketones, depicting solubility from partially water soluble to hydropho-
bic, with formate in water [34]. The new complexes [(p-cymene)RuCl(Ln)]
and [Cp*RhCl(Ln)] (Cp* = η5-C5Me5) were prepared, where L represents
water-soluble ligands functionalized with trialkyl ammonium side groups, i.e.
H2N(CH2)2NHSO2-p-C6H4CH2[NMe2-(CnH2n+1)]+ ([HLn]+; n = 8, 16). The surface
tension measurements showed micelle formation at very low concentration,
i.e. 0.6 mM. The C16 tails were able to adsorb at the water–substrate interface
and, thus, showed exceptionally high catalytic activity. This Ru-based catalyst
doubled the hydrogenation reaction rate of hydrophobic ketones, as compared to
non-micellar ones. In addition, the same authors studied the cooperative interaction
of surface-active ruthenium analogue RuLn (n = 8, 16) with other added surfactants
(cationic, anionic, and zwitter-ionic), in transfer hydrogenation of hydrophobic
ketones in water [35]. As expected, the added surfactants lowered the critical micel-
lar concentration (CMC) of RuLn, resulting in better emulsification. RuL8, having
shorter chain, were not capable of making micelles alone. Thus, after adding dode-
cyl sodium sulfate (C12H25SO3
−Na+), the performance matched with that of RuL16.
The authors concluded that the distribution of the catalyst/surfactant/substrate at
the interface was affected by the solubility of the ketone in water.
Wang et al. found that the addition of commercially available cationic surfactant
cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), in presence of lipophilic [36] and
hydrophilic [37] catalysts, improved the reactivity and enantioselectivity of asym-
metric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) of aromatic ketones and imines. However, the
same did not affect the enantiomeric excess (ee) for aliphatic ketones. To overcome
this issue, Rh was complexed with the amphiphilic diamine ligand (Figure 5.1) [38].
The length of the catalyst chain (n) of ligand was varied from 1 to 16 and named
as L1–L5. Out of these investigated ligands, a single-chain chiral metallosurfactant
Rh-L4 gave incredible ee for α,β-unsaturated ketones, specifically octan-2-one, of
up to 99%, which had n = 11. The ligands having 4–8 carbons in the tail drastically
improved the efficiency of the reaction, which can be seen in Figure 5.1. However,
further increase in the length did not affect the conversion and the ee value
anymore.
Another classical example of performing hydrogenation reactions with water as
a solvent was illustrated by Lin et al., who designed various amphiphilic ligands
and complexed them with rhodium [39]. These chiral-surfactant-type catalysts

were employed in the ATH of long-chained aliphatic ketoesters. The interactions
between the catalyst and the substrate in the core of metallomicelles were found to
be responsible for excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99% ee). The long alkyl chains
of amphiphiles were ordered in a regular fashion in micelles, which gave advantage
in stereoselectivity. Due to the use of metallomicellar catalyst in the reaction, the
transition state formed was stabilized by CH-π interactions between methyl group
of catalyst and the aromatic ring of substrate.
Oxidation Reaction
Oxidation reactions are some of the most important organic transformations
generating quite useful products. When we compare the micellar and non-micellar
medium, the concentration of dissolved molecular oxygen is more in the latter. This
property gives an advantage of using metallosurfactants in the organic reactions
as catalysts. Thiruvengetam et al. [40] reported the use of molybdenum-based
metallomicellar catalyst, (C19H42N)[MoO(O2)2(C6H4NO2)] (Mo1), in oxidation of
unsaturated alcohols. The mentioned Mo complex activated the molecular oxygen
in aqueous medium, and its mildness led to controlled and selective oxidation. The
same catalyst was found to be versatile and chemoselective, as it performed excel-
lently in presence of other functionalities as well, like cyano, sulfide, aryl-hydroxyl,
tertiary amine, internal/terminal alkene, internal/terminal alkyne, and acetal.
The recyclability was investigated through one of the model substrates, which
demonstrated yields between 92% and 97% till eight catalytic runs (Figure 5.2).

Diels–Alder reaction. The advantage of using metallosurfactants over conventional
surfactants like sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), CTAB, and dodecyl heptaoxyethylene
ether (C12E7) for the Diels–Alder reaction has been investigated by Engberts and
coworkers [41]. The reaction was slowed down by micelles of SDS, CTAB, and
C12E7 [42], while the metallosurfactant, Cu(DS)2 micelles, enhanced the rate by up
to 1.8 million times making the reaction very efficient. The diene and dienophile
used in the reaction were in close proximity when Cu(DS)2 was used, because
the dienophile complexed with Cu ions, resulting in favorable orientation, which
accelerated the overall reaction. Moreover, Engberts also proved vesicular catalysis
to be more interesting than micellar catalysis, taking green chemistry into consid-
eration [43]. Even at very low concentration (0.1 mM), vesicles formed from a cyclic
phosphate ester (5,5-di-n-dodecyl-2-hydroxy-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinan-2-one) with
copper(II) counterions (Cu(dDP)2) were found to be very efficient. The rate of the
reaction depended a lot on the preparation technique of vesicles.

and heat conditions; therefore, several groups have attempted to synthesize and
utilize metal-coordinated NHC for various applications [44]. Polarz and coworkers
have reported the synthesis of Pd–NHC metallosurfactant to use as catalyst in C–C
cross-coupling reactions [45]. To compare the results, another non-amphiphilic
coordination compound of same catalytic center was also prepared and employed
as catalyst under identical reaction conditions. The micellar catalysis improved the
turnover frequency by onefold. Similarly, two more novel complexes were prepared
using NHC with Cu(I) and Fe(II) as head for polymerization of methyl methacrylate
[46]. The colloids of polymethyl methacrylate formed in the reaction were stabilized
by catalyst located at their surface.
Another hybrid surfactant was synthesized using NHC ligand (IPr) and a struc-
turally simple surfactant, which was further complexed with gold to employ it as
a catalyst in hydration reactions [47]. IPr is one of the N,N′-diarylimidazolium
carbenes, which has hydrophilic head group and can form robust and catalytically
active complexes with gold. When the simple surfactants were used, the anionic
surfactant displayed better results than cationic and neutral surfactants because of
effective complexation with Au(I). The effect of the different alkyl chain lengths
on the catalytic activity was also studied, and it was deduced that the chain length
should be optimal (C11-IPr) to place the gold atom on the boundary of the micelle
and increase the rate of the reaction (Figure 5.3). If the chain is short (C7-IPr), then
the gold atom will be immersed in the micelle, while the long chain (C15-IPr) forces
the gold atom out of the micelle.

Stimuli-Responsive Metallosurfactant-Catalyzed Reactions
To overcome the difficulties associated with the organic reactions, it is per-
tinent to look into synthesizing surfactants with desired properties. One of

the major issues was separation of catalyst from the medium during work-up,
for which a stimuli-responsive catalyst was synthesized, which undergoes
hydrophilic-to-hydrophobic changes in response to temperature. A “smart”
poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) was grafted on the metal center of
Mn(III) complex to develop a novel thermoresponsive surfactant-type catalyst
(denoted as catalyst I) (Scheme 5.1) [48]. The nanoreactor, used as catalyst in the
asymmetric epoxidation of alkenes in water, had hydrophobic core for reaction and
hydrophilic surface for solubilization in aqueous medium. The thermoresponsivity
of catalyst helped to recover and reuse the catalyst for five cycles by only changing
the temperature.

Another thermoresponsive catalyst using Ti(IV) was synthesized, by the same
group, for asymmetric sulfoxidation in water [49]. The transmission electron micro-
scope (TEM) images of the synthesized surfactant system proved the formation
of micelles in water at room temperature. These metallomicelles acted as catalyst
in the sulfoxidation reaction using H2O2 as an oxidant. High chemoselectivity
and enantioselectivity were obtained with the synthesized metallosurfactants and
thermo-controlled separation aided in easy recovery.
5.2.4
Miscellaneous Reactions
An outstanding example of enantioselective addition in water was given by
Kobayashi and coworkers by using metallosurfactant, scandium tris(dodecyl
sulfate) [Sc(DS)3] [50]. Asymmetric ring opening of epoxides was carried out with
the metallosurfactant as catalyst. When the same reaction was performed with
Sc(OTf)3, the reaction was very slow and even after increasing the concentration
of nucleophile or increasing reaction time, the yield did not improve. Moreover,
Sc(DS)3 was also found to catalyze the synthesis of various polysubstituted and
polycyclic quinolines [51]. Table 5.1 shows the reaction of 2-aminobenzophenone
(1a) and with ethyl acetoacetate (2a), which is catalyzed by various Lewis

acid-surfactant-combined (LASC) catalysts (employing various metals such as In,
Sm, Gd, Fe, and Dy) in aqueous medium at room temperature. Among the LASC
investigated, [Sc(DS)3] displayed the finest result. Same reaction was carried out to
produce other quinolones and no side reactions were observed, which are otherwise
present in basic conditions.
As discussed previously, metallosurfactants are particularly efficient in vesicular
catalysis. One such example of vesicular catalysis is hydroformylation of 1-octene
[52]. Rhodium complexes of a series of xantphos derivatives with surface-active pen-
dant groups were used as catalysts in this reaction. When the ligand was large, it
formed vesicles in aqueous solution. These vesicles were stable at high temperature,
which was an advantage over micellar catalysis. The high reaction rates were result
of the hydrophobicity of large ligands, which ultimately increased the solubility of
organic substrates in water.
Another cross-coupling reaction is reported in which metallomicelles of palla-
dium(II) complex were efficient catalysts [53]. Suzuki–Miyaura reactions of aryl bro-
mides substituted with a long alkyl chain and arylboronic acids at 80 ∘C were carried
out in neat water. The reaction was found efficient for synthesis of biphenyl deriva-
tives, which are used as liquid-crystal compounds.

electrocatalysts aiding water splitting, leading to fuel cell generation. Pradeep et al.
synthesized the palladium-based metallosurfactants, i.e. Pd(CPC) using cetylpyri-
dinium chloride (CPC) as a surfactant [54]. CPC surfactants are amphiphilic in
nature, which retard the particle aggregation and act as a linker between the
electrode surface and the electrolyte. Further, the HER performance was measured
in 0.5 N H2SO4 using metallosurfactants coated over stainless steel as working
electrode, and the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) polarization curve shows the
catalytic performance where onset potential and overpotential correspond to 15
and 269 mV versus RHE (Figure 5.4). The lesser Tafel slope value of 57 mV dec−1
confirms the faster kinetics of the metallosurfactant during electrocatalysis. The
electrochemical impedance studies were measured at different potentials of 0.1443,
0.0557, 0.2557, 0.4557 V versus RHE, which indicated the decrease in charge
transfer resistance with increase in potential. This work gives new design to develop
Pd-based metallosurfactants for energy-based applications.
Pradeep et al. also designed a new redox active, cost-effective Co(II)-based
metallosurfactant, i.e. hexadecylpyridinium trichloro cobaltite [CoCPC(I)], which
was used as an electrocatalyst in HER [55]. The activity of the electrocatalyst was

evaluated in acidic medium (0.5 N H2SO4). During catalysis, the electrocatalyst
CoCPC(I) showed an onset potential of −30 mV, an overpotential of −307 mV, and
the Tafel slope corresponding to 104 mV dec−1 as illustrated in Figure 5.5. The
authors have studied the detailed mechanism for the electrocatalytic activity by
evaluating various factors that include mass activity, turn over frequency (TOF),
exchange current density, contact angle measurements, stability studies, and poi-
soning effect on activity. According to the studies, cobalt metal present as counter
ion with surfactant leads to the faster formation of the micelles than surfactant CPC.
This metallomicellar structure modifies the interfacial property of the surfactants
and is responsible for the better catalytic performance.
Further, Gonawala et al. developed cobalt-based phenolate metallosurfactants
[CoIII(LN2O3)H2O], which was deposited on the fluorine-doped tin oxide glass (FTO)
substrate using Langmuir–Blodgett films (LB) technique [56]. This LB technique
provided the control to optimize the films thickness and its uniformity toward
heterogeneous water oxidation. It was found that the phenolate-rich complexes are
more active for proton reduction in acidic media. The uniformity and amphiphilic
behavior of the LB films was analyzed and confirmed that high pressure leads to the
formation of homogeneous films. Further, they evaluated the catalytic activity of the

films toward water oxidation in the sodium borate solution at different pH values.
As per the results obtained, the single LB monolayer of the metallosurfactants
showed an overpotential of 0.5 V. Figure 5.6 shows the correlation between the
number of layers deposited and its electrocatalytic efficiency. The optimal point
of the LB films shows better activity up to 9th layer with a constant increment in
the catalytic performance from 1st to 9th LB layer. Further, the catalytic efficacy of
the LB films was estimated by evaluating different factors like turn over number,
stability studies, post-morphological and compositional analysis by scanning
electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies.
Kunkel et al. generated a new concept that mainly focuses on the phenomenon of
self-assembly in catalysis where surfactants with functional head group aggregates
lead to better catalysis [57]. Herein, vesicular-shaped Co(II)-based metallosurfac-
tants were synthesized and head group consisted of diethylenetriamine fullerenes,
which were used as electrocatalysts toward the water oxidation. The electrochemical
catalysis was studied at concentration below and above critical aggregation concen-
tration (cac). Further, the amphiphilic properties were investigated by evaluating
surface tension and dynamic light scattering (DLS) parameters. It was shown that
there is no aggregation at lower concentration, but the aggregates formed at 0.2 M
concentration, which have hydrodynamic diameter of 150 nm.
The morphology shown by TEM confirmed the formation of vesicular-type
structure, not the micelles. The electrocatalytic activity measurements were done
by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) as shown in Figure 5.7. It has been found that
Co-based metallosurfactants show the onset potential for OER to be +1180 mV
and for HER the value corresponds to −1260 mV in comparison to pure organic
surfactant, which is catalytically inactive. This clearly established the dependency

Light-Driven Hydrogen Generation
The urge to replace the conventional energy resources with the solar fuels has
gained immense attention in the last few decades. The mechanism of photocatalytic
water splitting has complex and tedious kinetics in homogeneous solution. The
light-driven H2 evolution or water reduction has been done by means of various
constituents like photosensitizer (PS), electron mediator, sacrificial reductant (SR)
or electron donor, and proton-reducing catalyst [58–60]. The efficiency of the
H2 evolution can be improved by using linked donor–acceptor molecules with a
large electron transfer rate [61]. The photoexcitation of the donor–acceptor system
facilitates the direct transfer of electrons to the catalyst without mediator. Further,
a lot of investigation in the field of photocatalysis used for water splitting has
been carried out by using sacrificial electron donor to achieve higher H2 evolution
efficiency [62]. H2 evolution process is usually done in both aqueous and organic
solvents-based catalytic systems [63]. Gratzel et al. had investigated the effect of

presence of the micelle solution due to efficient electron transfer [64]. Basically, the
use of micelles helps in modifying the light-induced electron transfer [65].

dhpdbpy = 4,4′-diheptadecyl-2,2′-bipyridine) in equimolar toluene and water sys-
tem. This biphasic catalytic study is only possible by using amphiphilic molecules
such as metallosurfactants due to their capability of forming microemulsions
[66]. The microemulsion system leads to the photochemical conversions through
photoinduced electron transfer and charge separation in microscopic entities.
Herein, the Rh-based amphiphile [Rh(dhpdbpy)2Cl2]Cl was used as reducing
catalyst and oxalic acid as sacrificial electron donor. The electrochemical behavior
of the metallosurfactants was determined from CV using glassy carbon electrode as
working electrode. The addition of 1-octylamine results in an ion pair formation
with oxalic acid, which interacts with the metallosurfactants and commences the
catalytic process. Herein, 1-octylamine plays an important role for better solubility
of the two layers. Figure 5.8 explains the effect of the solvent system on the
catalytic performance. Here, 1-octylamine is crucial to generate H2 as it facilitates
considerable mixing of the biphasic solvent and in situ ion formation between
1-octylamine and oxalic acid. This system acts as surfactant and strongly interacts
with metallosurfactants. But no such ion formation takes place for sodium oxalate
and catalytic activity was reduced. Furthermore, the effect of concentration of the
metallosurfactants on catalytic activity was also evaluated. Their study established
the importance of the microemulsion formation in the biphasic system that leads to
the improved photosensitization process.
Adams et al. have studied the effect of cationic micelle on the light-induced
electron transfer, charge separation, and back electron transfer between elec-
tron donor [Ru(NH3)6]2+ and series of other Ru(II) diamine complexes, which
act as chromophores having general formula [(bpy)2Ru(LL)]2+ (LL = bpy;
4-R-4′-methyl-2,2′-bpy) [67]. The processes of quenching and back electron transfer
were strongly influenced in the presence of CTAB as surfactant for MC13, MC17, and
DC17 solution (MCx = 4-methyl, 4′-x-2,2′-bipyridine where x = pentyl (MC5), ter-
decyl (MC13), or heptadecyl (MC17) or DC17 = 4,4′-diheptadecyl-2,2′-bipyridine).
Figure 5.9 signifies that in the presence of CTAB micelles, the charge separation
efficiencies of chromophores MC13 and MC17 increase drastically. The rate of back

leads to the inhibition of back electron transfer, which is an important photo redox
reaction. This study shows the advantage of micellar system, which leads to the
charge separation of the reactants due to hydrophobic and electrostatic forces and
consequently influences the catalytic H2 and O2 production from water [63, 68].

energy-based systems. This could be a potential answer to the rising energy demands
of the world, which needs a clean and green fuel alternative that works to mitigate
the climate change issues as well. In addition to improvement in yields and selec-
tivity in organic reactions, the major advantage of using metallosurfactants is their
ability to switch from organic solvent into aqueous medium to carry out reaction
conversions, thus working in accordance with the principles of green chemistry.
This also leads to minimal toxicity, easy product extraction, and recyclability of the
catalyst, which is most desired in any catalytic conversion. Metallosurfactants have
garnered a lot of attention with their potential to serve as excellent electrocatalysts
and photocatalysts employing the easily available transition metal ions as compared
to the precious Rh, Ir candidates in terms of commercial availability, cost, and
stability. The field of metallosurfactants is an emerging area as surfactants act as
a linker and reduce the particle aggregation, the interfacial properties between
electrode and electrolyte, which is important for charge transfer catalysis. However,
there is still a lot of scope of research in using metallosurfactants as electrocatalysts
to meet up the renewable energy resources requirements, which provides an open
and exciting area to researchers to work on, related to energy-based applications.

Introduction
Surfactants are amphiphilic compounds comprising a hydrophilic head group and
a hydrophobic tail that provides an ability to solubilize polar and nonpolar com-
ponents, respectively. Since the head group of a surfactant is polar, the transition
metal ions upon incorporation in the surfactant moiety interact with the headgroup,
resulting in the formation of a surfactant metal complex called “metallosurfactant.”
With the introduction of a transition metal into the conventional surfactant system,
the interaction and aggregation behavior of fabricated metallosurfactant becomes
of great interest owing to its multidimensional applications. Catalysis, sensing,
energy-transfer devices, antimicrobial agents, drug delivery, magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) contrast agents (CAs), optoelectronics, and template agents for the
synthesis of mesoporous nanomaterials, are a few well-explored applications of
metallosurfactants [1–10].
Distinct metal ions like cobalt, copper, ruthenium, platinum, and gadolinium
can coordinate with the metallosurfactant [11]. Veeralakshmi et al. [12] studied
the influence of hydrophobicity of cobalt(III)-based metallosurfactant on the
interaction with nucleic acids and proteins. They selected single- and double-chain
amine-based surfactants, that is, diethylenediamine and tetradecylamine, respec-
tively, for studying the interaction with calf thymus DNA and human serum
albumin (HSA). A strong interaction of HSA and DNA with the double-chain
metallosurfactant was reported in comparison to single-chain surfactant. Figure 6.1
shows the structure of a typical cobalt(III)-based metallosurfactant [13].
Like
conventional
surfactants,
metallosurfactants
retain
the
property
of
self-aggregation, vesicle, or micelle formation. Various aggregates with dif-
ferent geometries such as metallomicelles, inverted metallomicelles, bilayers
or vesicles, and metal-liposome (metallosomes) have been formulated in dif-
ferent types of solvents. Zha et al. [7] evaluated the aggregation behavior of
Cn–Cu–Cn-based metallovesicles and employed it for the encapsulation and

with the formula Na2{Cu[CnH2n+1N(CH2COO)2]2} (n = 8, 12, 16) were syn-
thesized by using ultrasonication method. The Cu(II) coordinates with the
carboxylic acid moiety of the surfactant’s head group, overcoming the electro-
static repulsion between the head groups and thereby directing the headgroups
in proximity to each other to form Cn–Cu–Cn metallovesicles. The fabricated
metallovesicles showed 70% encapsulation efficiency for doxorubicin hydrochlo-
ride and exhibited Fickian diffusion release. Zhiltsova et al. [14] synthesized
copper-based metallosurfactant complex by employing a bicyclic amphiphilic lig-
and, 1-hexadecyl-4-aza-1-azonibicyclo[2.2.2]octane bromide. The micellar solution
of the prepared complex has been employed for the solubilization of quercetin.
The metallomicellar complex exhibited good solubilization of quercetin in both
pre-micellar and post-micellar region. The interaction between polyphenol moieties
and metallomicelles was found to be purely electrostatic and the aqueous solubility
of drug was enhanced.

The formed inverted micellar aggregates were 92 nm sized and had an aggregation
number of 1.1 × 105.
Sharma et al. [16] formulated supramolecular metallosurfactant of platinum
using cationic amphiphilic ligands (N,N,N-cetyltrimethylammonium bromide)
of various chain lengths (C-8, C-10, C-12, C-14, and C-16). The authors reported
a decrease in the self-aggregation behavior of the prepared metallosurfactants
with respect to an increase in alkyl chain length, and in addition, demonstrated
the use of prepared metallosurfactants in therapeutic applications. Parera et al.
[17] fabricated metallovesicles using supramolecular rearrangement of metal
carbonyl metallosurfactants. Molybdenum metallosurfactants were synthesized
(Figure 6.3) and their aggregation behavior was investigated. Cryo-transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of metallovesicles revealed the presence of
small unilamellar vesicles (size <100 nm), large unilamellar vesicles (size >100 nm),
multilamellar (onion-like concentric vesicle inside) vesicles, and multivesicular
(non-concentric small vesicles inside large vesicle) vesicles.
Based on the booming research in the field of metallosurfactant-based
self-assemblies such as metallo-vesicles, metallo-micelles, metallosomes, along
with their wide application arena, the present chapter focuses on the utility of
metallosurfactants as nanovectors, drug-delivery agents, and MRI contrast agents,
which has been discussed in detail.

Metallosomes as Drug-Delivery Agents
Nanomaterial-based assemblies proffer to be a promising scaffold in the field of
drug delivery that increases the pharmacokinetics, potency, and safety profile
of potential drugs. In this scenario, the best way to utilize these nanostructures

is to develop supramolecular self-assemblies comprising metallosurfactants and
phospholipids called metallosomes (or metallovesicles) [18]. Metallosomes can
mimic biological membranes and are utilized as carriers for targeted and controlled
drug delivery. Till date, numerous bioactive and agrochemical agents have been
encapsulated within the metallosomes using two-tailed or single-tailed surfactant.
However, mostly, double-chain surfactants are exploited to fabricate metallosomes.
Marín-García et al. [19] fabricated metallosomes by mixing soybean phosphatidyl-
choline (a natural non-toxic phospholipid) with metallosurfactant, that is, molybde-
num pentacarbonyl (Mo(CO)5), or molybdenum tetracarbonyl (Mo(CO)4). The toxi-
city of developed metallosomes was found to be 10-fold lower than that of the metal-
losurfactants. The formed assembly remained stable even after dilution. Following
the approach, Marín-Garcia et al. [20] reported a new supramolecular system, pre-
pared by mixing molybdenum metallosurfactant with phospholipid phosphatidyl-
choline. The investigation of formed metallosomes using microfluidics revealed that
the aggregation tendency of metallosomes is solvent dependent.
Wang et al. [21] reported higher encapsulation of carboxyfluorescein in anionic
and cationic surfactant-based molybdenum vesicles. Nehru et al. [22] focused
on the fabrication of fluorescent metallosomes by employing double-chain
surfactant-based ruthenium(II) complexes. The self-assembled complex was found
to be of spherical morphology and showed excellent stability in an aqueous medium.
An increase in size of the metallovesicles was noted with an increase of head size
and chain length of surfactant. Ruthenium complexes greatly decreased α-helix’s
percentage content in bovine serum albumin (BSA)/HSA.
Further, Sakla et al. [23] developed CO-releasing metallosomes via incorporation
of a carbonyl complex of manganese into 1,2-stearoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine
(DSPC) lipid-based system. Prepared metallosomes were stable under low temper-
ature and dark environment. The presence of a large surface area of the vesicles
made them an efficacious CO delivery vehicle. Further, cytotoxicity studies demon-
strated the biosafety of the metallosomes in a dark environment. Kidani et al. [24]
formulated metallosomes using the complex (1,2-diaminocyclohexane)platinum(II)
(DACHPt) and employed them for the delivery of oxaliplatin (an anticancer drug).
Similarly, Osada et al. [25] provide a promising strategy for the development of the
metallosomes using DACHPt with the help of copolymers (Figure 6.4).
Ionic surfactants or lipids interact easily with metal due to the presence
of electrostatic interactions. Following this approach, Pal et al. [26] reported
the

revealed that the fabricated metallo-vesicles have a particle size of 33 nm. The
cytotoxic concentration (C50) of metallosomes in embryonic kidney cells (human
embryonic kidney [HEK] 293-T) was found to be 50% at 1.25 mM concentration.
Arroyo et al. [27] synthesized the metallosomes containing copper(II) and zinc(II)
complexes of 1-alkyl-1,4,7-triazacyclonoanane and explored their DNA transport
studies in vitro and in vivo environment. HEK 293-T-cells were utilized for the DNA
transfection efficiency studies. Obtained results demonstrated the good transfection
efficiency of Cu-based metallosomes in delivering of DNA vaccine in murine

smart carrier in drug-delivery purposes by reducing the complexity of multidrug
administration.
6.2.2
Metallosurfactants and Its Self-Assembled Structures
as Nanovectors
During the past decade, nanovectors have been extensively studied for the encapsu-
lation, transportation, and delivery of pharmaceutical drugs. Nanovectors not only
enhance the absorption of drug in the body but also provide controlled target-specific
release, improve the efficacy of drug delivery, and prevent drug degradation. Met-
allosurfactant acts as a pharmaceutical agent and possesses the ability to act as a
nanovector for drugs.
Lebrón et al. [9] designed metallosurfactant-based nanovectors from (2,2′-
bipyridine)ruthenium(II) complex, [Ru(bpy)3]2+ as a possible anti-cancer drug
candidate. In this study, the metallomicelles fabricated from the cytotoxic metal
complex showed promising anticancer activity. Beside anticancer activity, the
[Ru(bpy)3] metallomicellar system showed an encapsulation efficiency of 60%
and 10% for doxorubicin and levofloxacin, respectively. Moreover, ruthenium(II)
polypyridyl complexes were toxic to cancer lines and demonstrated a strong
bacterial and bacteriostatic activity.
Badawi et al. [28] evaluated in vivo antitumor, antibacterial, and antimi-
crobial activity of copper (Cu)-cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB)
metallosurfactant-based nanovector. Cardiotoxicity investigation revealed a signifi-
cant effect of Cu-CTAB metallosurfactant on serum enzymes. Cu-CTAB exhibited a
promising anticancer effect by decreasing the tumor volume and raising the means
survival rate in an ethyl actetate (EAC)-inoculated group. Apart from this, Cu-CTAB
showed excellent antimicrobial activity against Desulfonamonas pigra, Escherichia
coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans.

pH-responsive drug delivery. Anticancer drugs – mitoxantrone, doxorubicin, and a
conjugated complex of fluorescein isothiocyanate with octaarginine (R8-fluorescein
isothiocyanate [FITC]) – were used as model drugs. The Pluronic F127-Zn-R8-FITC
coordination complex exhibited successful pH-responsive release under weakly
acidic conditions (Figure 6.5). In vivo tumor imaging and cell assay (SPCA-1)
confirmed the pH-responsive release in the pH range of 6.2–6.8 using fluorescent
confocal micrographs.
6.2.3
Metallosurfactant Co-polymer-Based Micellar Systems for Drug
Delivery
Besides using metallosurfactant or metallo-vesicles for drug entrapment, the
micellar solution of metallosurfactant has garnered attention for solubilization
of hydrophobic drugs. Polymeric micelles have been extensively explored for the
entrapment of drugs. For such systems, amphiphilic block copolymers such as
Pluronics are more commonly used. The hydrophobic segments of the co-block
polymers self-assemble to avoid contact with the aqueous media and get associated
together by hydrophobic interactions. The interaction between the metal and
co-block polymer controls the fabrication and application of polymer–metal com-
plex micelles (PMCM) for the encapsulation and release of drugs. Kim et al. [30]
synthesized PMCMs by mixing cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum II (CDDP), triblock
poly(lactic acid)-poly(ethylene glycolpoly(ethylene glycol) (PEG–PLA), and den-
drimer phthalocyanine (DPc) in phosphate buffer saline solution via polymer–metal
coordination interactions. The sustained release of anti-cancer drug, CDDP, makes
PMCM a promising biomedical nano-imaging device.
Furthermore, supramolecular-based copolymer micelles have been explored
as a potential nanocarrier for the successful entrapment and release of drugs.
The self-assembly of these metallo-supramolecule-based block copolymers has
been investigated by researchers for application in drug delivery. Liang et al. [31]
developed ultrasound responsive metallo-supramolecular block copolymer micelle
using diblock poly(propylene glycol) (PPG) and PEG copolymer (Figure 6.6). PPG
and PEG copolymers were bonded together by a Tpy bond at the junction point
PPG-[Cu]-PEG. The fabricated metallo-micelles showed high-intensity focused
ultrasound (HIFU)-responsive release for hydrophobic molecules such as Nile red
and pyrene.
In another study [32], authors investigated the micellar behavior and properties
of metallo copolymers with different transition metals such as ruthenium. The

with site-specific cleavage allowed the control of drug-release behavior of such
systems from the polymeric micelles.
Ge and coworkers [33] synthesized metal-supramolecular core cross-linked
micelles from poly(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl methacrylate)-b-poly(2-(diethylamino)
ethyl methacrylate-co-4′-(6-methacryloxyhexyloxy)-2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine) [PMEO
2MA-b-P(DEA-co-TPHMA)] block copolymers. The synthesis route involving the
formation of bis(terpyridine)ruthenium(II) complexes is represented in Figure 6.7.
The metallosupramolecular micelle exhibited good structural integrity in the
aqueous solutions at varying temperatures and pH and showed multiresponsive
(pH-responsive and thermoresponsive) release of the model drug (the Nile red).
6.3
Metallosurfactants as MRI Contrast Agents
MRI is a non-invasive biomedical diagnostic imaging procedure for three-
dimensional tomographic imaging of soft tissue of an organism. In MRI, contrast
agents (CAs) are typically used to enhance sensitivity and to improve the contrast
between healthy and diseased tissue. The faster the relaxation rate of tissue, the
greater the intensity of the signal is, and brighter the image it produces. Thus,
metallosurfactant-based micellar structures and metallosomes have gained much
attention as MRI contrast agents.
For instance, the high magnetic moment and the long electron spin relaxation
time of gadolinium (Gd, III) make it an ideal candidate for CAs. Note that to cir-
cumvent the toxicity of free Gd(III), it is employed in the stable chelate complex
form. Generally, the Gd(III) chelates are attached to the self-assembled structures
such as micelles and liposomes to increase the relaxation rate. Gong et al. [5] syn-
thesized high relaxivity MRI contrast agents using Gd(III)-based metallosurfactants
via miniemulsion polymerization. The synthesized metallo-colloids showed 240%

of enhancement in the relaxivity. The metallo-colloids were able to produce contrast
much brighter than the deionized water in the presence of Gd(III) metallosurfactant
complex owing to the faster relaxation of proton of deionized water in the presence
of metallosurfactant.
Chen et al. [34] synthesized Gd(III)-based MRI CA using quaternary ammonium
long alkyl chain surfactant via miniemulsion polymerization. The fabricated
metallo-colloids were reported in the size range of 50–110 nm with a relaxivity
of up to 22.77 mM−1 s−1. In vivo cytotoxicity study showed only 10% decrease in
cell viabilities after 48 hours incubation of Gd(III) metallosurfactants solution of
concentration up to 200 μM.
Zhu et al. [35] developed multimodal imaging probes using carbon dots to form
metallosurfactant-based CAs as bimodal contrasting probes (Figure 6.8). Negatively
charged carbon dots formed the metallo-micelles of the size 50 nm through ionic
interactions. A high magnetic resonance (MR) relaxivity value of 19.73 mM−1 s−1
was observed. The cytotoxicity results showed that the carbon dot-metallosurfactant
CA is benign to cells with good photoluminescence.
Xu et al. [36] developed bimodal MRI and fluorescence imaging agents using
co-assembly of Gd(III) metallosurfactant, conjugated polymeric fluorescent
nanoparticles, and Pluronic F127 cross-linked via organosilica (Figure 6.9). Fabri-
cated micelles of size 90–100 nm with a relaxivity of 105.37 mM−1 s−1 were observed.
The obtained relaxivity was found to be 20 times higher than commercial contrast
agents. In vivo cytotoxicity study revealed biocompatibility of the synthesized CAs.
MRI imaging of kidney tumor showed significant enhancement in MR signal
intensity. The signal was detectable even after 24 hours administration because of
the long circulation of CAs in blood.

6 Metallosurfactants as Drug-Delivery Vehicles
6.4
Conclusion
The present chapter has highlighted the use of metallosurfactant as a promising
agent in the field of drug delivery. Metallosurfactants possess self-aggregation
properties and form distinct assemblies such as metallomicelles, inverted metal-
lomicelles, nanovectors, metallovesicles, metallosomes, and MRI contrast agents.
Briefly, cobalt, copper, platinum, ruthenium, and gadolinium-based metallosurfac-
tants, including their synthesis, characteristic features, and potential applications,
have been discussed elaborately. For instance, gadolinium(III) metallosurfactants
have been extensively studied as MRI agents due to the higher magnetic moment
and longer spin relaxation time of gadolinium. However, more in vivo studies
related to the safety profile of these metal-based complexes are required for their
practical applicability.

Introduction
Surfactants have emerged as compounds of utmost scientific and technological
importance, witnessing an escalating progress in their structure as well as function-
ality. Surfactant systems with inorganic constituents (metal ions) form a subclass
of hybrid surfactants having properties corresponding to both interfacial and metal
ion chemistry. Metal ion-containing surfactants are known to the scientific world
with different names like metallosurfactants, metalloamphiphiles, metal–hybrid
surfactants, metal ion-decorated surfactants, and organic–inorganic hybrid sur-
factants. Characteristically, metallosurfactants are a means of localizing many
physicochemical properties of the metal ions at air/water, oil/water interface. Thus,
it can be said that metallosurfactants are perfect combination of co-ordination and
surface chemistry. Metals introduced chemical reactivity to the otherwise naive
surfactant molecules. Metal ions also carry their redox behavior in metallosur-
factant as well owing to their variable oxidation states, while the conventional
surfactants include carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfur-like elements, which have
fixed covalence and cannot show redox activity. It can be said that conventional
surfactants do not possess any chemical reactivity of their own. But the embodiment
of metal ion into their structure can overcome this limitation. Such remarkable
features of these designer amphiphilic molecules attract enormous attention
owing to several advantages over conventional surfactants. The most fascinating
property of the surfactants and amphiphiles is to self-assemble above a particular
threshold concentration [1]. Metallosurfactants possess a variety of fascinating
applications in the fields of magnetic resonance imaging [2], template for porous
materials [3], template for fabricating nanomaterials [4], membrane mimetics
[5], thin-film optoelectronics [6], interfacial photo physics [7], various separation
methods [8], catalysis [9], etc. Dual functionality of metallosurfactants and ability
to act as two-in-one precursor (i.e. metal ion source as well as particle protector)

7 Metallosurfactants as Molecular Machines for the Preparation
silica material (metal ion source and micellar template) made them promising
novel precursor materials. Potential of metallosurfactants as nanoreactor for the
fabrication of nanomaterials is discussed in Chapter 9. In the present chapter, a
comprehensive discussion on the role of metal hybrid amphiphiles as molecular
machine for generating porous silica material has been outlined. Also, a brief
introduction on molecular machines (MM) and porous silica-based materials has
also been provided herein.
7.2
Porous Silica-Based Materials
Generation of porous silica material gained momentum after the discovery of
surfactant-based templating approach for its synthesis by Mobil Corporation
laboratories [10]. Since then, porous silica material has garnered vast attention and
found application in innumerable fields like sensing [11], storage [12], heavy metal
ion removal [13], enhancing the bioavailability of poorly soluble drugs [14], and as
excellent adsorbent material [15]. Besides manmade porous materials like ceramics
and cements, nature is also a good reservoir of pervious material. For example
soil, zeolites, bones, wood are excellent porous materials, which exist in nature.
Characteristically, porous silica is a low-density and high surface area material and,
depending on the pore size, can be classified into three categories, viz. microporous,
mesoporous, and macroporous. Microporous materials have pore size of less than
2 nm, while mesoporous have their pore size in the range of 2–50 nm. Materials
with pore size more than 30 nm fall into the category of macroporous materials
(Figure 7.1).
Among various types of porous materials, mesoporous silica-based materials are
most extensively studied because of their ordered pore nature, tunable pore size,
and wide range of morphologies. Due to the very high specific surface area, porous
silica material can be further exploited in catalysis; however, catalytically active
agent (metal ions) needs to be incorporated. To do so, metal salt is usually added

to the synthesized porous silica material, but it leads to non-uniform distribution
of metal ion and the harsh treatment during calcination leads to the structural
deformation of the composite. Along with structural deformation, leaching of metal
ion can also occur during the course of reaction, which suggests that metal ions
are not firmly attached with the silica, hence losing their purpose. An alternate
method is to use metallosurfactant, which potentially produces homogeneously
distributed metal nanocolloids onto the surface of porous silica material. A detailed
description about the same has been provided in Section 7.3 of this chapter, but
before proceeding further, let us have a glimpse at the molecular machines.
7.2.1
Molecular Machine
In simple words, machine is a tool created by human beings to make their work
easier. The molecular machines (MM) are the example of machines at molecular
level comprising certain set of molecules, which can respond to an external stimuli.
MM came into focus in 1980, after the breakthrough work by Jean-Pierre Sauvage,
a French chemist. He designed a molecule named “CATENANE” consisting of two
entangled molecular rings, which can rotate around each other when energy is
supplied (Figure 7.2).
Catenanes are termed as first-generation molecular machines [16]. Another
ground-breaking discovery in this field was done by James Fraser Stoddart and
Bernard Feringa in 1990s [17, 18]. The three shared the 2016 Nobel Prize in
Chemistry. It is surprising to realize that molecular machines are omnipresent and
vital for living beings. All the activities happening in a living body are controlled
by the biological molecular machine. Inspired by the nature, manmade molecular
machines are the area of most intensive research nowadays.

7 Metallosurfactants as Molecular Machines for the Preparation
Micro/nanoscale molecular machines have revolutionary applications especially
in biomedical field. From drug delivery to tumor diagnosis and biopsies, MM have
made things easier and approachable, which otherwise seems impossible. After two
decades of basic research in the field of MM designing and functioning, it is illus-
trated that MM can write, image, and repair nanoscale structures. Scientists believe
that designing and potential of molecular machines can only be limited by human
imagination.
To design MM with precise control over its translational and rotary motion is still
a challenge. Self-assembly, which is a characteristic feature of amphiphilic moieties,
can play a significant role and can be exploited as molecular machines, specifically
metal ion-directed self-assembly as exemplified by copper-based catenanes devel-
oped by Sauvage. Since then, metal-based molecular assemblies have been continu-
ously explored and discussed. Major contributors to the field have been discussed in
detail herein.
7.2.2
General Synthesis Procedure of Porous Silica Material
Porous silica material can be prepared by two approaches, i.e. template-free and
template-based synthesis [19]. Both the approaches have their own advantages.
However, template-based synthesis can provide a better control over size, dis-
tribution, and interconnectivity of the pores. The most common template-based
synthesis involves the use of a cationic surfactant [20, 21]. Usually, an acidic or basic
aqueous solution of surfactant is taken at or above critical micellar concentration
(Figure 7.3).
To the mixture, a silica source (orthosilicates, fumed silica, sodium silicates, etc.) is
added for silicalization. Presence of surfactants leads to the polymerization of silica
source around the surfactants aggregates. Finally, the template is removed either by
extraction or calcination to get the porous material. Template word can be related to

the molecular machine as it takes input in form of chemicals and gives off porous
silica as output.

Different Types of Porous Silica-Based Material
7.3.1
Copper@Surfactants-Based Porous Material
Metal–surfactant complexes having both the templating agent (surfactant) and cat-
alytic agent (metal ion) are suited best to the production of metal ion containing
porous silica material. Dual nature of metallosurfactants made them favorite precur-
sor for the synthesis of metal ion-embedded porous silica material. In this respect,
the very first experimental work was reported by Poppl et al. in 1995 [22]. A macro-
bicyclic cage compound (C12CESTO) having surfactant properties has been utilized
for capturing cupric ion.
A
solution
of
5-dodecyl-12,17-dimethyl-1,5,9,12,17
pentaazobicyclo-[7.5.5]
nonadecane (C12CESTO) was mixed with cupric nitrate solution to make com-
plexation of Cu(II) with C12CESTO. Cu(II)@C12CESTO complex was then mixed
with micellar solution of cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) to form
CTAC-Cu(II) C12CESTO mixed micelles. Mixed micellar solution and tetra-
butylammonium silicate were added together. Resulting gel was subjected to
hydrothermal treatment to generate mesoporous silica materials designated as
CESTO-CuMCM-41. To compare the role of Cu(II) complexation with C12CESTO,
the authors also prepared CuMCM-41 without C12CESTO. The term MCM-41
stands for Mobil Composition of Matter no. 41 with a pore size within in the range
2–6.5 nm. Thus, the prepared material, i.e. CESTO-CuMCM-41, has a pore size of
2–6.5 nm. Further, it was confirmed that complexation of copper ion with surfactant
macrobicyclic cage compound leads to the firm association of metal ions with silica
framework. Cupric ions occupy ion-exchange sites on silica walls by interacting
with four framework oxygens. In conclusion, it was made clear that location of
cupric ion into the silica material can be easily controlled by metallosurfactant.
In another study [3], sarcophagines were used to form metallosurfactants. Sar-
cophagines are macrobicyclic hexamines, which acts as metal binder to form cop-
per metallosurfactants (Figure 7.4). To prepare porous silica, TEOS was added to a
mixture of conventional organic surfactant, i.e. CTAB and prepared copper metallo-
surfactants with constant stirring.
Resulting reaction mixture was then subjected to hydrothermal treatment fol-
lowed by calcination. It was observed that calcination process resulted in extensive
aggregation of copper in the form of copper crystallite inside the porous silica
as evident from the TEM image (Figure 7.4). Temperature of calcination process
also affects copper crystallite size. At 300 ∘C, smaller aggregates were formed,
while 500 ∘C resulted in bigger aggregates. The authors concluded that different
metal-doped mesoporous silica can be prepared using different metal-caged sar-
cophagine. Additionally, by altering the ratio of metallosurfactants to conventional
surfactants, pore size and homogeneity of pores can be easily tuned. However,
findings did not throw any light on the application part of the prepared material.

Pim et al. [23, 24] reported fabrication of meso- and microporous silica without
using conventional surfactants at all. Bistable copper metallosurfactants-based
molecular machine were prepared by authors. Characteristic feature of the syn-
thesized material is that it responds to the pH change, i.e. complex can exist in
deprotonated (pH 12) and protonated (pH 5) forms (Figure 7.5).
Hydrolysis of TEOS in the presence of deprotonated metallosurfactant template
results in mesoporous silica, while protonated metallosurfactant template resulted
in microporous silica. Till now, porous material with uniform pore size had been
discussed stating that creating uniformity in pore size is the key factor that is to
be controlled. However, material with dual porosity, i.e. two different size of pores
within the same material, have their own advantages. Slowly thrust is shifted toward
preparation of porous material with pore size of two and three scale length simul-
taneously in a single step. In this regard, Kanwar et al. [25] reported the generation
of meso-macroporous silica material embedded with copper oxide nanoparticles
(NPs). Solid lipid NPs and copper–cetylpyridinium chloride surfactant were used
as dual template. Copper surfactant micelle acts as template for mesopore material
and copper ion source and also as a stabilizing agent or co-surfactant for solid lipid
NPs, which are indeed the building blocks for macropores. Close proximity of metal
ion with hydrophobic part leads to the uniform distribution of copper oxide NPs into
the mesopores of silica matrix as seen in electron microscopy. Prepared material
was then explored as heterogeneous catalyst for the reduction of nitro aromatic
compounds and hexacyanoferrate(III). Presence of pores of different length in the
single matrix provides extra benefit to the diffusion controlled reaction. It was stated
that mesopores are the active for catalysis, while interconnected macropores act as
a gateway to incoming reactant and outgoing product. In this manner, saturation
of active can be easily avoided as proven by the product yield. The product yield of
99.9% for nitrophenol reduction and 98.7% for hexacyanoferrate reduction verified
that prepared composite acts as efficient catalyst. In a separate study, the prepared
material was then explored as adsorbent for genomic DNA by Bhar et al. [26].

To do so, meso-macroporous silica was first surface passivated by aminopropyltri-
ethoxysilane. Porous material accompanied by nanoparticle deliver extra surface
area for attachment to the adsorbate. It was the first ever report describing the
adsorption of whole genomic DNA onto the silica surface.
Keeping up the pace, Rehman et al. [27] developed metallic and bimetallic
oxide/SiO2 material using corresponding metallosurfactants as template. In this
case, metal ion is not present as an integral part of the head group of the surfactant
but as modified counter ion. Counter ion of CTAB, i.e. bromide, was modified
by Fe, Cu, Ni, Zn metal ions. Metallosurfactants of the type CTA+[CuCl2Br],
CTA+[NiCl2Br], and similarly for other metals were synthesized. But the hydrolysis
of TEOS was carried out only in the presence of CTA+[CuCl2Br], CTA+[NiCl2Br]
and equimolar ratio of these two surfactants as a template. Hydrolyzed product
was then calcined at 550 ∘C to get the final product, i.e. CuO/SiO2, NiO/SiO2, and
CuO–NiO/SiO2. Prepared material was tested as a potential catalyst for nitrophenol

reduction. It was found that bimetallic material is way more an efficient catalyst as
compared to their monometallic counterparts. It was argued that synergy between
copper and nickel increases the activity of catalyst, hence, higher efficiency.
7.3.2
Ruthenium@Surfactants-Based Porous Material
The study made by Jervis et al. [28] in this field was a huge development. The
authors did excellent work on ruthenium metallosurfactant as a precursor for
mesoporous silica material. The authors proposed metallosurfactant-based route as
a direct approach for the fabrication of heterogeneous catalyst. To an acidic solution
of metallosurfactant, silica precursor tetramethylorthosilicate was added. After two
hours of stirring, red-colored gel possessing a hexagonal phase was produced as
observed by optical microscopy. The final product was obtained by calcination of
the gel at 600 ∘C for six hours and viewed under TEM (Figure 7.6). The material
obtained was then tested for the hydrogenation reaction of hex-1-ene to hexane with
an excellent turnover number, i.e. 877 mol hexane (mol Ru h)−1 Furthermore, the
role of calcination temperature and other conditions on the mesoporous structure
was also checked. It was observed that at 400 ∘C, the material obtained was of high
homogeneity and the size of RuO2 NPs was no larger than 10 Å while at 500 ∘C,
irregular-sized and uneven distribution of RuO2 particles were observed.
BET surface area and turnover number for the conversion of 1-hexene to hexane
was also found to be higher for the material calcined at 400 ∘C as compared to the
500 ∘C sample. Also, a significant weight loss was observed upon calcination in oxy-
gen atmosphere rather than nitrogen atmosphere.
After realizing the catalytic potential of metal-embedded mesoporous silica
material, Amos et al. [29] carried out in-depth investigation of the synthesis
protocol. Ruthenium metallosurfactant templated synthesis was also compared to
that of conventional surfactant (CTAB). The authors adopted both the liquid-crystal
template (LCT) and true liquid-crystal templating (TLCT) approach to prepare
porous material. Conclusively, the role of TLCT and metallosurfactant was found

to be superior in terms of specific surface area and homogeneity. On similar lines,
Co-surfactant complexes having tetradentate amine, triethylenetetramine, alkylated
pyridine ligands have also been explored as templating precursors [30]. Similarly,
Yam et al. [31] also explored the LCT efficacy of ruthenium-based surfactants.
They prepared nine ruthenium metallosurfactants with different chain length of
hydrophobic part to control porosity. Several noticeable features were decoded by
this study. First one is that head group of the prepared metal–surfactant complexes
is quite bigger than the head group of the conventional surfactants. But the size of
head group does not affect the mesophase behavior. Also, these complexes were
stable under acidic conditions (pH 2), which is a determining factor while doing
hydrolysis of silica source to generate ordered structure. Further, it was observed
that RuO2 NPs are evenly distributed throughout the porous material. To summa-
rize, the authors concluded that by altering the chain length and head group of the
metallosurfactants, it is feasible to tune the pore size.
In a breakthrough experiment by King et al. [32], oxidation of water to oxygen gas
in the presence of cerium(IV) was successfully achieved by catalyst using RuO2 NPs
anchored mesoporous silica obtained from ruthenium metallosurfactant. Oxidation
of water has a great significance in splitting of water in electrochemical cell, but it is
a difficult redox reaction to carry out. Due to the requirement of 4e−simultaneously
the reaction suffers very large over-potential. This difficulty was easily surpassed
using the above-mentioned catalyst. Silica-supported RuO2 NPs catalyze the oxida-
tion of water even in anhydrous conditions. The authors [33] further synthesized
and characterized mesoporous silica with uniformly distributed Au, Pd, Pt, Ir NPs
by utilizing the TLCT feature of polyoxyethylene-10-lauryl ether.
7.3.3
Cobalt@Surfactants-Based Porous Material
Along with copper surfactants, Hondow et al. [3] fabricated cobalt-based sar-
cophagine surfactants as well. Size of pores/porosity in the final product was found
to be dependent on the shape of template. Cobalt surfactant forms long worm-like
micelle, which aids in the formation of M41S type of porous material; also, at
much higher concentration it forms lamellar structure. Due to this, ordered pore
arrangement was not observed for cobalt surfactant. However, regular strips were
visible throughout the material pointing toward the multilamellar nature of tem-
plate or aggregates of cobalt metallosurfactant, though they have less surface area
as compared to copper counterpart but much higher than aqueous impregnation of
cobalt salt and also found to be more promising template for mesoporous silica as
compared to copper surfactants of the same type.
Cobalt soap was used as co-template for the preparation of cobalt integrated with
mesoporous silica [34]. [CoCH3(CH2)10COO]2 ⋅2H2O was used as a co-template
along with the micellar solution of C16TMABr, which leads to the formation of
Co-MCM-41 material (Figure 7.7), which may be exploited for catalysis.
Co soap alone was not able to form micelles but in the presence of micellar
concentration of CTAB, it can directly form mixed micelles, thus, resulting in Co
NPs-embedded mesoporous silica. The synthesized material may be exploited in

catalysis as demonstrated by Corberán et al. [35] in the selective oxidative dehy-
drogenation of isobutane. Co-containing mesoporous silica acts as a homogeneous
catalyst.
Activation of the alkane molecules was achieved at the inner pore volume, which
resulted in generation of active free radicals. Thus, formed free radical can either act
inside the void volume, which is termed as nanoreactor, or interact with another cen-
ter present on the mesopore wall. Also, UV–vis diffuse reflectance showed unique
tetrahedral coordination of cobalt(II) in the present material, therefore, making it an
active and selective catalyst for the said reaction. Active centers available for catalysis
were ascribed to the Co NPs present within the porous material.
7.3.4
Iron@Surfactants-Based Porous Material
Magneto-responsive mesoporous silica can also be prepared by magneto-responsive
surfactant. Magneto-responsive surfactant, i.e. cetyltrimethylammonium ferrate
(CTAF), can act as a structure directing agent for the synthesis of porous material
having magnetic character [36]. Synthetic methodology adopted was simple, but the
appearance of magnetic character in the end product surprised the authors because
iron NPs were absent in the end product (Figure 7.8). Magnetism was ascribed to
the molecular and electronic spin of the iron ion present within the porous material.
The major breakthrough in iron surfactant chemistry came in 2015, when the
synthesis of porous material with dual porosity, i.e. meso-macroporous silica, was
reported [37].
Along with the solid lipid NPs, which were synthesized in the presence of CTAF
(responsible for macroporosity), micelles of Pluronic P-123 (responsible for meso-
porosity) were employed as template. Thus, the formed composite was characterized
as Fe2O3 NPs-impregnated meso-macroporous silica by different techniques, viz.
SAXS, BET, TEM, etc. SAXS pattern revealed the presence of hexagonally arranged
mesopores interconnected with the macropores.
Evidence of macroporosity was given by TEM, BET analysis, and mercury intru-
sion porosimetry. Fabricated composite was then tested for catalytic activity in the
Fenton-like reaction involved in the degradation of methylene blue (MB). According

to the report, degradation of MB is a diffusion-controlled reaction and macropores
easily channelize the diffusion of reactants as well as the product making the cata-
lyst highly efficient in terms of yield and time consumption. Catalyst was found to
be quite active even after the fifth repetitive use.
An advancement to phenomena was reported by Berro et al. [38]. Instead of NPs,
they devised a methodology to impregnate single metal atom into the mesoporous
silica using metallosurfactants. Single-atom catalyst popularly known as SAC is in
demand nowadays. SACs are even more efficient than NPs as catalyst. To make
non-precious metal similar or even better catalyst than precious metals (Au, Pt,
Ag), SAC strategy was developed for such metals. For example, Pt catalyst can be
replaced with Co or Fe for oxygen reduction reaction. Keeping this in mind, sin-
gle iron atom containing mesoporous silica was prepared using cetyltrimethylam-
monium trichloromonobromoferrate (CTAF) surfactant as template. Mixed micelle
of Pluronic P-123 (non-ionic surfactant) and CTAF was taken as template, while
tetramethylorthosilicate was used as a silica source (Figure 7.9).
Non-ionic surfactant plays an important role of controlling structural and textural
characteristics of the framework and CTAF controls the Fe loading into the silica
matric as well as homogeneous distribution of iron atom. During the calcination
process, metal ion usually gathers and forms clusters in the form of metal/metal
oxide nanoparticle. However, in the present case, no agglomeration was observed

as confirmed by ICP–AES and UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. One can
determine nature of metal ion present by understanding the coordination of metal.
Spectra band at 235 nm suggested that tetrahedral iron atom remains insulated from
each other. Also, lack of any peak above 350 nm confirmed the absence of octahedral
iron and, hence, absence of iron NPs in the prepared material. The authors con-
cluded that by regulating the ratio of CTAF to non-ionic surfactant, loading of iron
atom into the silica framework can be easily controlled, minimum being 0.15 Fe
atom nm−2. This is a remarkable achievement in the field of metal ion-embedded
porous silica materials.
7.3.5
Other Metallosurfactant-Based Porous Material
Metallosurfactant containing metal ions other than copper, ruthenium, cobalt,
and iron are less explored, but their chemistry is well established. Yuan et al.
[39] synthesized manganese-modified mesoporous silica (Mn@MCM-41) using
cetylpyridinium bromide complexed with [Mn(CH3COO)2 ⋅4H2O] in alkaline
medium. Interestingly, it was observed that the shape of Mn@MCM-41 depends
upon the stirring rate of the reaction medium.
Higher stirring rate tends to form vesicles of the surfactant, while lower stirring
rate corresponds to the typical spherical-shaped micelles arranged in hexagonal
manner. Thus, produced composite material was successfully characterized by
various techniques, viz. ESR, NMR, TEM, and BET.
In another report [7], iridium surfactant was used as template for the production
of iridium ion-containing mesoporous silica (Figure 7.10).
Being highly luminescent, optical property of the synthesized complex was tuned
instead of catalysis. The authors argued that by using iridium metallosurfactant, it
was easy to minimize the aggregation of active centers responsible for luminescence
as templating could lead to tailoring of interatomic distance. Another problem over-
come by using this methodology was avoiding the unlimited excess of molecular
oxygen, which otherwise caused optical quenching. By incorporating iridium inside
the mesoporous silica, the excess of molecular oxygen got limited, thus proving it to
be excellent optical material with high quantum yield.
Recently, Chang et al. [40] realized the potential of metal-chelating surfactant
as a structure-directing agent for the fabrication of mesoporous silica and reported
the formation of alkali metal (Na+, K+, Cs+), alkaline earth metal (Mg2+, Ca2+,

Sr2+, Ba2+), and transition metal ion (Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+) containing meso-
porous silica particles. Metal ions form salt by coupling with Pluronic P-123 in
aqueous solution. Micellar solution of metal chelated surfactant complex produced
corresponding metal ion containing mesoporous silica particles. Complexation of
metal ion takes place within the hydrophilic domain of the surfactant. Strength of
bonding between metal ion and surfactant played a major role in deciding the size
of the mesoporous particles formed. Stability constant of the complex followed the
order Co2+ < Ni2+ ≤Cu2+ > Zn2+, which is in accordance with the Irving–Williams
stability constant series.
Besides porous silica material, porous alumina loaded with metal NPs was also
explored as catalyst by Hackett et al. [41]. Atomically dispersed Pd(II) centers in
the porous alumina support act as highly efficient and selective catalyst for the aer-
obic oxidation of certain allylic alcohols like benzyl, cinnamyl, crotyl alcohols. The
authors gave a new term selox for selective oxidation as no evidence of solvent oxida-
tion/isomerization/polymerization was observed and only pure benzaldehyde, cin-
namaldehyde, crotonaldehyde were formed as a principal reaction product.
7.4
Future Perspectives
Till now, metallosurfactants are more explored in terms of structural and tex-
ture direct agents for porous silica. Though generated porous material is well
explored as a catalyst, the potential or capability in other field is kept at bay.
Metal ion-containing mesoporous silica can be further exploited as a compart-
mentalized drug-delivery agent, for selective and efficient adsorption/desorption
of biomolecules, metal ion detection and sensing, pesticide removal from waste
water, optoelectronics, etc. Furthermore, only few transition metal ion-containing
metallosurfactants have been tested as molecular machines for mesoporous silica.
Each metal has its own characteristic features, which can be employed for specific
purpose. Employing metallosurfactants with different types of metal ion can open
gateway for numerous other applications. As a future prospective, maybe porous
material with pores of three different length scales can be designed. Likewise,

metal ions/or metallic/bimetallic NPs-impregnated mesoporous silica seems a
common outcome of metallosurfactant-based template synthesis. However, porous
material containing single atom can also be designed from metallosurfactants. Not
only silica-based porous material but also alumina-based porous material can be
designed and fabricated using metal hybrid surfactants. All these studies signify
that modified surfactants hold great potential in terms of structural diversity and
their applicability.
7.5
Conclusion
Modified surfactants are excellent molecular machines for generating porous silica
material with tailor made properties. Employing metallosurfactants as soft template,
problem of leaching active centers or metal ion from the silica sieve can be eas-
ily avoided. Metal ion or NPs can be firmly and orderly arranged within the silica
matrix because of close association of metal ion with the surfactant template itself.
Porous material impregnated with nanomaterials can be easily engineered using
metallosurfactant alone or a mixture of metallosurfactant and conventional surfac-
tant. By regulating the ratio of metallosurfactant to conventional surfactant during
the synthesis process, it is possible to get pores of desirable size. In other words, met-
allosurfactants give researchers more freedom to play with porosity, structural and
textural diversity of the silica matrix. Prepared material found tremendous applica-
tion in selective catalysis, while applications in other fields are yet to be explored
and synchronized.

8.1
Introduction
Gene therapy is an experimental technique that uses genes in the treatment and/or
cure of a disease. The replacement of defective genes or the cure of some genetic
disorders in a patient is included in such a technique. In general, this therapy is being
employed in incurable diseases or without known treatments, always with the goal
of saving lives.
Up to now, most trials carried out were related to diseases caused by recessive
gene disorders, such as hemophilia, sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, or muscular
dystrophy; with acquired genetic diseases, as cancer; or to viral infections as AIDS
[1–9]. Results obtained in recent years seem promising. In fact, the FDA approved
the first gene therapy in 2017 (Tisagenlecleucel, commercialized by Novartech and
used in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia), and more studies are expected
to be approved in 2022 [10]. Although there have been seven marked products of
gene therapy authorized in EU, only six are still available [11].
The most used procedure in this therapy consists of the insertion of healthy genes
into target cells to repair the damaged nucleic acids. The size of the gene material, the
repulsive forces between the phosphate groups of the DNA backbone, the negatively
charged heparin sulfate proteoglycan expressed on the external cellular membrane,
as well as the innate immune system of the cells, make the transfection process dif-
ficult. Therefore, some nanostructures, called vectors (also known as nanocarriers
or nanovehicles), help to get a successful insertion.
The administration of genetic material into cells can be carried out by physical or
chemical methods. The former does not need any vector, the gene transfer happens
by an electrical or mechanical stimulus provoked on the cells such as electropora-
tion [12], microinjection [13], or electrotransfection [14]. All physical methods show

great disadvantages since they put cells under great stress and it takes a long time to
obtain an effective delivery.
The chemical methods require the use of vectors, which can be viral or non-viral:
●Viral vectors are habitually retrovirus, lentivirus, adenovirus, etc. (Figure 8.1).
They have demonstrated a high transfection efficiency, ease of production, a
low toxicity, and a large stability. However, their use also shows disadvantages.
Although they are usually modified to render them safe, sometimes they can
generate negative immune responses and provoke serious side effects in the
patients [15–17].
●Non-viral vectors are usually cyclic molecules or aggregates of amphipathic
molecules. These vehicles are normally characterized by having regions with
different polarity. Some examples are nanoparticles, micelles, cyclodextrins,
calixarenes, or liposomes; all of them cationic in nature (Figure 8.2) [18, 19].
They show lower transfection efficiency compared to viral vectors, but their side
effects do not appear to be so harmful as those provoked when a strange agent
enters into the organism.
There are numerous studies in the literature about the synthesis and characteriza-
tion of surfactants, and about the use of monomers or their self-assemblies as vectors
of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) in gene therapy [20–23]. However, even if their use
for the incorporation of genetic material into cells has become a frequent and effec-
tive treatment, there are still aspects that require in-depth study to achieve scientific
advances. One of them is related with the synthesis and optimization of new vectors
with a greater efficacy.
Some decades ago, several amphiphilic molecules containing metal ions were
prepared and used in several applications such as electron storage devices in
photoredox processes, potential precursors in new synthetic methods, catalysts
in heterogeneous processes, antimicrobial or antibacterial agents, nanocarriers
of drugs, etc. [24–28]. These amphipathic molecules, with properties of metal
complexes as well as of surfactants, are known today as metallosurfactants. The
metal ions are usually located in the polar head groups of the molecules, although
in some cases they can act as counter ions or even they can be part of organometallic
fragments in the hydrophobic region of the surfactants [29–31].

Given the importance of the use of metals in both the therapeutics and the diagnos-
tic of medicinal chemistry [32], some vectors containing metals have been prepared
as vehicles of genetic material. The incorporation of metal ions into the nanocarriers
seems to improve the transfection processes of several aggregates, leaving an inter-
esting open door in the advance of the research in gene therapy. In this chapter, we
will explore the use of metallosurfactants, and of diverse structures obtained from
their assemblies, in human gene delivery studies.
8.2
Metallosurfactant Monomers
In vitro studies about DNA condensation have become important working tools to
understand the processes that occur in the cells in vivo when a gene therapy treat-
ment is going to be performed. In fact, the condensation represents an important
process by which the genetic information is packaged and protected to be released
later in the task cell.
Most of the studies on DNA condensation have been carried out with cationic
surfactants, single- or double-chained, or gemini surfactants, with different polar
head groups [33–39]. When cationic surfactant molecules are added to a DNA solu-
tion, electrostatic interactions occur between them. The monomers are located at
the surface of the DNA backbone forming premicellar aggregates or hemimicelles.
Due to the hydrophobic character of the surfactant tails, an increase in the surfac-
tant concentration causes a conformational change in the double-stranded helix of
the polynucleotide from a more extended structure to a globular one, more com-
pact, that could allow the passage of genetic material through the cell and nuclear
membranes (Figure 8.3).

Recently, metallosurfactants have caught the attention of a lot of researchers.
These molecules have the properties of surfactants, but also those correspond-
ing to the metal contained in their structure. These metals, generally from the
transition series, provide the amphiphilic molecules properties such as para-
magnetism, color, catalytic and redox properties, or sensitivity to pH [40, 41].
Bearing this in mind, diverse surfactant-cobalt(III) complexes of the type
cis-[Co(X)2(C14H29NH2)Cl](ClO4)2 (X = ethylenediamine, 2,2′-bipiridyl or 1,10-
phenanthroline) and cis-[Co(X)(C14H29NH2)Cl](ClO4)2 (X = triethylenetetramine)
were synthesized and characterized by using techniques such as IR, NMR, UV–vis
absorption spectra, and elemental analysis [42]. These metallosurfactants demon-
strated a higher capacity of self-assembly to form micelles than their surfactant
analogues, without the presence of the metal complexes in the polar head group.
The authors found that all these metallosurfactants interacted with DNA. According
to the characteristics of the different cobalt complexes present in the surfactant,
electrostatic interactions, van der Waals forces, and intercalation binding modes
drive the formation of DNA–surfactant complexes. In this regard, phenanthroline

has been shown to make the association more favorable than other ligands.
Viscosity measurements demonstrated that the binding of this planar ligand with
the polynucleotide was not fully intercalative, there was a slight steric hindrance.
The interaction modes observed with the other ligands were only external (surface
binding) and/or groove binding.
The cytotoxic activity of the metallosurfactant cis-[Co(trien)(C14H29NH2)Cl]
(ClO4)2 on human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) has been measured [43]. Different in
vitro studies showed time-dependent toxicity effects on the cells due to the existence
of hydrophobic forces in the binding surfactant/DNA. This metallosurfactant kills
the cells mainly by apoptosis, a process of programmed cell death characterized by
chromatin marginalization, nuclear fragmentation, and apoptotic body formation.
The apoptosis occurs in cells, which are meant to be removed without affecting
the neighboring cells [44]. Some necrosis was also observed in the p53-positive
breast cancer cells. According to the authors, the Co(III)-based surfactant studied
could be of application in cancer therapy. It was also pointed out that the ability
to modulate the death of a cell must be recognized as a potential item in any
therapeutic treatment.
It is known that transition metal complexes display important physical properties.
In particular, Ru complexes show photochemical and photophysical properties
that can be exploited in medical applications [45]. For example, some Ru com-
pounds are able to penetrate tumors, binding to nucleic acids in a different way
than cisplatin, an antineoplastic drug frequently used in chemotherapy, and
decreasing the toxic effects on the cells. Also, improvements in cancer treatments
can be experimentally observed thanks to the photochemical properties of Ru
complexes containing planar aromatic nitrogen ligands. For example, they can
suppress the immune response inhibiting the proliferation of T cells. Accordingly,
two Ru-based metallosurfactants, both derived from the 2,2′-trisbipiridyl Ru(II)
complex, with different number of hydrophobic tails of the same length (the
double-tailed [Ru(2,2′-bipy)2(4,4′-(C11H23)2-2,2′-bipy)]2+ complex and the mono-
catenary [Ru(2,2′-bipy)2(4-(CH3)-4′-(C11H23)2–2,2′-bipy)]2+ complex – RuC11C11
and RuC1C11 – Figure 8.4) were synthesized and their interactions with calf
thymus DNA (ct-DNA) were quantified to improve and advance the design of
non-viral vectors for gene therapy [46]. The metal center in the polar head group
possesses measurable light-responsive (redox and spectroscopic) properties [47].
This permitted the surfactant/ct-DNA binding to be investigated without the use of
any external dye (note that the latter could modify the structural characteristics of
the polynucleotide). The addition of RuC1C11 and RuC11C11 monomers to a DNA
solution provoked the formation of premicellar aggregates (hemimicelles) on the
surface of the polynucleotide (surfactant concentrations lower than critical micellar
concentration – CMC – values were used). This assembly is due to two types of
interactions: an electrostatic interaction between the cationic head groups of the
surfactant and the negative phosphate groups of the ct-DNA and the hydrophobic
forces among the hydrocarbon tails. Binding constant (Kb) values at different nucleic
acid concentrations were obtained from fluorescence emission intensity values of
the Ru surfactants, by using a quantitative method developed in such a manuscript.

Structures of the Ru metallosurfactants.
Kb values demonstrated a sigmoidal dependence with the ct-DNA concentration.
This behavior confirmed the cooperative character of the binding process, that is,
the interaction of a first metallosurfactant molecule to a receptor (DNA) favors
the binding of a second ligand to the same receptor and so on. This interaction
finally resulted in a conformational change in the polynucleotide from an extended
double-helix structure to a more globular form. AFM images demonstrated such a
conformational change. The metallosurfactant monomer concentration necessary
to produce this change was lower for the double-tailed surfactant than for the
single-chain surfactant due to the stronger hydrophobic forces.
Results revealed the importance of the hydrophobic forces on the binding between
surfactants and DNA. This was also confirmed when cyclodextrin molecules were
added to the surfactant/DNA solutions. The formation of inclusion complexes of
the surfactants with cyclodextrin molecules (with stoichiometries 1 : 1 and 1 : 2)
[48] provoked the decompaction process of the surfactant/DNA globular complex
(Figure 8.5). The cyclodextrin concentration necessary to de-condense the nucleic
acid was lower for the RuC1C11/DNA complex than for the RuC11C11/DNA
complex due to the lower hydrophobic character of the former [46, 48]. Comparison
of the binding equilibrium constants corresponding to the formation of 1 : 1 and
1 : 2 metallosurfactant : cyclodextrin complexes showed that for the 1 : 2 complex
both cyclodextrin molecules are placed on the same hydrophobic chain of the
amphiphilic molecule.
The main role of the surfactant hydrophobic character in the interaction of the
amphiphilic molecules with DNA has also been highlighted with longer-chained

2,2′-bipy]2+ complex (RuC19C19); both with the same cationic polar head group
than those studied previously (Figure 8.4). Results obtained are now shown in this
chapter.
A simple route to get information about the interaction surfactant/DNA is by using
the competitive assay with the dye ethidium bromide. This probe binds with the
base pairs of the polynucleotide through an intercalative mode [49, 50] and shows
a high emission intensity when it is intercalated in the nucleic acid. A decrease
of this emission intensity was observed when both RuC1C19 and RuC19C19 were
added to an ethydium bromide–DNA solution. This behavior, due to the displace-
ment of ethydium bromide molecules from its intercalative position into the base
pair to the aqueous solution, was also observed for the analogous metallosurfactants
RuC1C11 and RuC11C11. Comparing results in Figure 8.6, a sharper decrease for the
double-chained surfactants than for the monocatenary ones is observed. This is due
to the greater hydrophobic character of the former, which facilitates the formation
of hemimicelles on the surface of the polynucleotide and its subsequent condensa-
tion. An analogous difference between single- and double-tailed surfactants was also
observed from circular dichroism (CD) measurements. Figure 8.6 shows the depen-
dence of the relative molar ellipticity of ethydium bromide obtained at a λ value of
308 nm (maximum wavelength corresponding to the probe band in CD) [51] on the

clearly observed for the double-chain surfactants.
Binding constants Kb corresponding to the interaction between both the
RuC11C11 and the RuC19C19 surfactants and ct-DNA were estimated from
emission intensity values of such Ru surfactants, in the presence of different
polynucleotide concentrations, and by using the method developed in [46]. A sig-
moidal dependence of Kb on the DNA concentration is observed. The same trend
was found for both the RuC11C11 and the RuC19C19 surfactants (Figure 8.7). This
confirms the cooperative character of the interaction between surfactants and DNA.
Kb contains two different contributions: electrostatic and non-electrostatic
(it must be noted that non-electrostatic interactions such as hydrogen bonds or π–π
stacking interactions could also occur between the bipyridyl ligands of the cationic
heads of the surfactants and the polynucleotide). When the DNA concentration
is high, the electrostatic interactions between the polar heads of the surfactant
and the phosphate groups of the DNA are the driving forces in the association
process. Therefore, the minimum value of the binding constants obtained for
high DNA concentrations will be mainly due to these electrostatic interactions
and, consequently, this value must not depend on the hydrophobic interactions of
the aliphatic chains of cationic surfactants (single and double chained). To verify
the validity of the method used to obtain the binding constants [46], the authors
compared the minimum values of Kb for all the Ru surfactants studied (RuC1C11,
RuC11C11, RuC1C19, and RuC19C19). The minimum values of Kb obtained
were 8.7 × 105 M−1 for RuC1C11, 8.6 × 105 M−1 for RuC11C11, 9.4 × 105 M−1 for
RuC1C19, and 9.7 × 105 M−1 for RuC19C19. As can be seen, all these values are
similar because the cationic head groups of these surfactants are the same. Besides,
this value agrees with the binding constant between the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ complex
(without any hydrocarbon tail) and ct-DNA, 8.0 × 105 M−1, previously obtained [52].
The addition of α-cyclodextrin to RuC1C19/DNA (and RuC19C19/DNA) solutions
produces the de-condensation of the globular state of the surfactant/polynucleotide
complex. This is due to the formation of inclusion complexes of surfactants with the

paring the equilibrium constants for the formation of the 1 : 1, 1 : 2, and 1 : 3 sur-
factant:CD complexes, it is demonstrated that all CD molecules are located in the
same hydrophobic tail, as illustrated with the RuC11C11 metallosurfactant in [46].
The importance of the hydrophobic forces in the condensation process of the nucleic
acid is demonstrated again. AFM images show the globular structure of the polynu-
cleotide in the presence of the different Ru surfactants studied (Figure 8.9).

constants of the surfactant/DNA complexes were estimated from electronic absorp-
tion and spectral titration [53]. Hyperchromism, a slight shift of the band, and a
competitive binding between the ethidium bromide and the Ru(II) metallosurfac-
tants were observed. According to the authors, these results indicate a binding of

intercalative nature between the amphiphilic molecules and the DNA, due to the
planar structure of the phenanthroline ligand, and a strong hydrophobic association
between the methylene groups of the hydrophobic tails and the polynucleotide.
Values of Kb about 105 M−1 were obtained, which agree with those obtained for
other Ru(II) metallosurfactants [54]. These high binding constants are in agreement
with an intercalative process, as was confirmed by the authors from viscosity mea-
surements. In vitro assays of these Ru(II) metallosurfactants were carried out with
human cervical cancer (HeLa) cell lines. Cytotoxicity depended on the dosage used,
as well as on the exposure time with the cells. Results showed a high cytotoxicity
against HeLa cells at low doses, but a lower toxicity against normal cells. This
indicates that these Ru metallosurfactants could be used in anticancer treatments.
Higher the hydrophobicity of surfactant, stronger cellular damage was observed.
Metabolic mechanism in tumor cells requires a high energy. According to the
authors, Ru(II) metallosurfactants possess the ability to diminish the energy status
in tumor cells, deactivating cellular functions and, hence, causing cell death. Low
concentrations of both metallosurfactants induced apoptosis and necrosis in the
cells. The inhibitory activity measured as IC50 values was lower for the double- than
for the single-chained surfactant due to an easier penetration of the hydrophobic
complexes in abnormal cells.
Interest in seeking less toxic and generally less health-damaging metal com-
plexes as a substitute of the well-known anticancer drug cisplatin has promoted
the preparation of surfactants with metals (or metal complexes) other than Ru.
By mixing diverse surfactants and the metal platinum complex [PtCl4]2−with a
stoichiometry 1 : 2 (K2PtCl4:surfactant), Sharma et al. prepared different type of
metallosurfactants in which the metallic centers act as co-ions in the amphiphilic
molecules (Figure 8.10) [54–57]. Besides their characterization, in vitro biological
studies were carried out. In this regard, cytotoxicity assays of the Pt-based surfac-
tants against MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell lines showed
strong anticancer properties for all the metallosurfactants when compared with the
pure surfactants, that is, the amphiphilic molecules without the metallic centers.
The toxicity increased upon increasing the length of the surfactant tails, due to
an increment in their hydrophobic nature. Conformational changes in proteins,
caused by the presence of the Pt metallosurfactants, were also observed.
Similar metallosurfactants were also prepared with silver [58] and copper [59]. In
the case of the silver metallosurfactants, only the interaction of Ag micelles with
DNA was studied. On the contrary, in the case of the copper surfactants, a compar-
ison between the pre- and the post-micellar systems was carried out. Both studies
will be discussed in Section 8.3.

8.3 Metallomicelles

Metallomicelles
The amphiphilic nature of the metallosurfactant monomers favors their aggregation
forming assemblies with diverse structures (micelles, liposomes, vesicles, etc.). Their
behavior in the transport of genetic material may differ from that of the monomers.
Kaur et al. [58] prepared Ag metallosurfactants with a stoichiometry 1 : 2
(AgB:CTAB), mixing a metal salt and the surfactant CTAB (cetyltrimethy-
lammonium
bromide).
The
surfactant
molecules
resulting,
[Ag(CTA)2Br3]
cetyltrimethylammonium silver bromide, are self-assembled forming metallomi-
celles. TEM images showed spherical metallomicelles at a metallosurfactant
concentration about 3xCMC. Lower stoichiometries (1 : 0.5) resulted in the forma-
tion of nanoparticles. The interaction of the Ag-based metallomicelles with ct-DNA
was studied. The hyperchromism effect obtained indicated the complexation of the
metallomicelles with the polynucleotide due mainly to electrostatic interactions.
The Ag complex was found to be cytotoxic in diverse cancer cell lines (human
leukemia HL-60, pancreatic MIA-Pa-Ca-2 and prostate cancer PC-3 cells). Results
also demonstrated a high potential of these metallomicelles as antimicrobial agents,
showing a stronger effectiveness against Gram-positive bacterial strains than
against Gram-negative ones. The cytoplasm of fungal cells was less damaged in
comparison to bacterial cells.
The metallosurfactant [Cu(L)Br3], where LBr is the ligand 1-cetyl-4-aza-1-
azoniabiciclo[2.2.2]octane bromide, was synthesized and characterized by Zhiltsova
et al. (Figure 8.11) [60]. Here, the metal center is part of the hydrophilic head. It
is joined through hydrogen bonds to the bicyclic ring of the ligand. Vesicles were
formed at surfactant concentration close to the CMC, and spherical micelles at
[surfactant] ≫CMC. The formation of metallosurfactant/oligonucleotide com-
plexes was confirmed. The binding constant seems to be higher in the presence of
the metal in comparison to that obtained with the ligand without the metal center.
Besides, the condensation of the genetic material only happens in the presence of
the ligand (with or without the metal center), but not when only the CuBr2 salt is
used. This result indicates once again the importance of the hydrophobic forces in
the nucleic acid condensation. In the opinion of the authors, this metallosurfactant
can act as nanovehicle of drugs and genetic material.
The importance of the hydrophobic interactions in the surfactant/DNA binding
was also showed with the functionalization of the cationic amphiphilic molecule
cetylpyridinium chloride (cpc) with Cu(II), the latter acting as counter ion, with

8 Metallosurfactants as Non-viral Vectors in Transfection
two different stoichiometries (1 : 1 and 1 : 2, Cu:cpc and Cu:(cpc)2) [59]. The amphi-
pathic ligand promotes the formation of micelles and a comparison in the binding
interaction metallosurfactant/ct-DNA is reported in both the premicellar and the
postmicellar region. A strong binding of the monomers (premicellar region) with
DNA was observed for both surfactants. According to the authors, the electrostatic
interactions between the negative charge of the nucleic acid phosphate groups and
the cationic metal-amphiphilic molecule provoke changes in the conformation of
the DNA from an extended coil to a globular form. This conformational change
seems to be more pronounced in the case of the double-chained surfactant than in
the single-chained one. Accordingly, the dimeric copper-based surfactant could act
as nanocarrier of DNA in gene transfection processes.
The Ru(II) metallosurfactants prepared by Lebrón et al. in [46], and other
analogous amphiphilic molecules, were also used for the formation of metal-
lomicelles to be used as nanocarriers of drugs and genetic material [54]. The
metallosurfactants studied were RuC1C11, RuC11C11, RuC1C19, and RuC19C19
(RuC1C19 and RuC19C19 being [Ru(2,2′-bpy)2(4-CH3-4′-(C19H39)-2,2′-bpy)]Cl2
and
[Ru(2,2′-bpy)2(4-4′-(C19H39)2-2,2′-bpy)]Cl2,
respectively).
TEM
images
revealed the formation of both spherical and elongated micelles depending on
the surfactant concentration. The favorable internalization of these metallosur-
factants into different cell lines seems to indicate that they could be used as
vectors of genetic material. An exhaustive and multidisciplinary study about the
binding of the metallomicelles with ct-DNA demonstrated a partial condensation
of the polynucleotide with RuC1C11 and a total condensation with the other
surfactants. Confocal fluorescence images show the adsorption of the micelles
on the DNA surface and its further condensation at a determined micellar con-
centration. Viability assays resulted in a moderate cytotoxicity at lower surfactant
concentration and a high toxicity for higher concentrations. According to these
results, the metallomicelles could be used as vectors in gene transfection for
low micellar concentrations and as nanocarriers of antibiotics with anticancer
and/or antibacterial activity with a determined specificity for LS180, MCF7, and
A549 cell lines.
Recently, Nehru et al. have carried out a study about the influence of both the
cationic head group size and the tail length on the interaction metallosurfactant/
ct-DNA [61]. This type of work contributes to the rational designing of metallodrugs
toward biomedical applications [62]. In particular, the interaction of the fluorescent
metallosurfactants derived from the [Ru(bpy)2Cl2]2+ and [Ru(phen)2Cl2]2+ com-
plexes with ct-DNA was studied. Taking into account the CMC values [63], within
the surfactant concentration range used monomers and micelles (or pseudomicelles)
were interacting with the polynucleotide. The binding constant values, obtained
from absorbance data at different polynucleotide concentrations, were higher for
complexes containing phen as ligand than those with bpy. A larger planarity in the
ligand (phen > bpy) favors the π-π stacking interactions between DNA base pairs
and, hence, the binding constant increases. An increment in the length of the hydro-
carbon chains seems to increase the binding constant due to a larger hydrophobic
contribution. In agreement with the binding constant values obtained, the authors

suggested an interaction of the Ru surfactant with DNA through a moderate
intercalation process. Viscosity measurements corroborated this hypothesis.
CD measurements demonstrated that only slight conformational changes in the
polynucleotide take place, so they do not seem to be good vectors in transfection
processes. This result does not agree to those obtained in the premicellar [46] and
postmicellar [54] regions of the metallosurfactants RuCiCii or RuCiiCii (i = 11
and 19). This could be due to a difference in the cationic head group size of the
metallosurfactant, but the low surfactant concentration used in this work could
also be important.
8.4
Metalloliposomes (Metallosomes)
As was previously mentioned, the amphipathic properties of metallosurfactants
favor the aggregation of their monomers. Liposomes are spherical structures
containing a phospholipid bilayer, non-polar in nature, and an inner aqueous
polar region (Figure 8.2). The mixture of different lipids generates the spontaneous
formation of a lipid membrane or film that, after a hydration process, forms the
liposomes [64, 65]. Given their structure, these aggregates have become one of the
best membrane models used to simulate the cell membranes and they can be used
as vectors in gene therapy [66–68].
The mixture of metallosurfactants and phospholipids forms vesicles, with struc-
tures similar to liposomes, that are known as metallosomes, metalloliposomes, or
metallovesicles.
Several metallosomes have been synthesized with biomedical applications
[31, 69–74]. Here we are going to discuss only those more related to gene trans-
fection processes.
Cruz-Campa et al. [75] synthesized in 2007 novel supramolecular aggregates with
amphiphilic Cu(II) complexes. To the best of author’s knowledge, this was the first
time that metalloliposomes were used as gene vectors. The complexes obtained
were [Cu(Ldt)2](OTF)2 and [Cu(Lot)2](OTF)2 (Figure 8.12) where Ldt is 1-dodecyl-
1,4,7-triazacyclononane, Lot is 1-octadecyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane and OTF is
trifluoromethanesulfonate.
The metalloliposomes were found to bind with the fluorescent pEGFP-N1
plasmid. This plasmid was condensed with both Cu liposomes. TEM images
demonstrated the formation of spherical metallo-lipoplexes, that is, spherical
vesicles/plasmid complexes. The use of the intercalative SYBR-Green dye proved
the encapsulation of the plasmid into the metallovesicle.
It is interesting to note the high transfection efficiency, about 37%, obtained with
the complex containing Ldt as hydrophobic ligand in the human embryonic kidney
293-T (HEK 293-T) cells. This value is, perhaps, the highest efficiency observed in
the presence of metallosurfactants. The efficiency value was much lower for the lipo-
some containing the Lot ligand. Higher transfection efficiency was obtained for the
metallosurfactant with a lower CMC value.

The authors also tested the importance of the hydrophobic forces in gene
transfection, since no observable transfection was found with the analogous
non-amphiphilic copper complex. They also indicated that the redox properties of
the metal complex could play an important role in the gene release process.
The self-assembly of the lipophilic Cu(II) complexes ([Cu(L)2](OTF)2) of
1-alkyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane (L) (Figure 8.13), with different hydrocarbon tail
lengths (alkyl: octyl, decyl, dodecyl, tetradecyl, hexadecyl, and octadecyl), also
resulted in the formation of metallosomes able to condense pEGFP-N1 plasmids
[76]. Good transfection efficiency values were obtained. As reported in [75],
the transfection efficiency in HEK 293-T cells decreases when the length of the
hydrocarbon chains of the ligands increases and, hence, when the CMC value
of the copper complexes increases. On the other hand, the Zn(II) complex of
1-dodecyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane gave the same transfection efficiency value as
its analogue with Cu(II). Therefore, a change in the metal ion, keeping the alkyl
length of the ligand constant, does not influence the in vitro transfection process.
However, Cu vesicles seem to be more stable than Zn vesicles as DNA vectors in
murine models. In fact, liposomes with copper produce more T cells than with zinc
at the lymph nodes and spleen samples according to in vivo transfection assays
carried out with BALB/c strain of mice vaccinated with the pVAX and pBT vectors
and the metallolipoplexes.
This group recently prepared a similar amphiphilic Cu(II) compound, the
bis-(4-pyridylmethyl hexadecanoate)-(1,4,7-triazacyclononane) copper(II) complex
(Figure 8.13) [77]. The metallovesicles (vesicles with structures like liposomes),
obtained by the reversed-phase procedure, condensed the pEGFP-N1 DNA plasmid;
but showed a low transfection efficiency of about 4% in HEK 293-T cells (the value

slightly depended on the method used). No transfection was observed by using the
analogous non-amphiphilic Co(II) complex.
Metallosomes containing a mixture of lipids (cholesterol and the double-chained
metallosurfactant bis-dodecylaminecopper(II) chloride) provoke slight conforma-
tional changes in the ct-DNA double-helix structure [78]. The binding of these aggre-
gates with the polynucleotide induces changes in its CD spectrum. The changes
observed, an increase in the ellipticity values of the positive band after the addition
of metalloliposomes to the DNA solution, are typical of an intercalative binding. No
condensation of the nucleic acid happened. Hence, these metalloliposomes are not
good vectors to be used in gene transfection. Changes in the cholesterol concen-
tration modified some properties of the lipid membrane, varying their drug release
ability.
A different situation was found in the study of the interaction of unilamellar
metalloliposomes
containing
1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine
(DOPE) and double-chained Ru metallosurfactants (Figure 8.4) derived from the
[Ru(bpy)3]2+ complex with DNA [79]. In this case, a strong binding between
the metallosomes and the nucleic acid occurs, resulting in the condensation of
the polynucleotide. Equilibrium binding constants are estimated for the met-
alloliposome/DNA association. Results demonstrated the importance of both
electrostatic and hydrophobic forces in such interactions.
Low cytotoxicity values and good internalization results for the Ru-based
metalloliposomes were obtained in MCF7 (human breast adenocarcinoma),
LS180 (human colonic epithelial adenocarcinoma), HepG2 (human liver car-
cinoma), A549 (human alveolar basal epithelial adenocarcinoma), and RPE-1
(hTERT-immortalized retinal pigment epithelial) cell lines. GFP (green fluorescent
protein) expression of the pEGFP-C1 plasmid in U2OS (human bone osteosarcoma
epithelial) cells provided a transfection efficiency value in the range 2.2–2.6%. This
value was slightly lower for the aggregates containing the metallosurfactant with a

longer hydrocarbon tail. Curiously, this result agrees with those observed with the
Cu(II) vesicles previously reported [75–77]. The transfection efficiency decreases
when the CMC of the metallosurfactant increases, even if the metal center is
different.
Su et al. [80] synthesized different metallosurfactants to be used for biomedical
applications, bearing the metal ligand Zn(II)-dipicolylamine as cationic head
group. Lipids with different length and nature (saturated and unsaturated linear
hydrocarbon chains, steroids, and tocopherol) were used as hydrophobic chains.
The self-assembly of these metallosurfactant monomers generated the formation
of metallosomes in both the presence and the absence of the neutral lipid DOPE.
All the metallosomes prepared interact with DNA, forming lipoplexes. The size of
such complexes depended on the +/−charge ratio and a size decrease was observed
when the condensation of the nucleic acid (ct-DNA and pGL3 plasmid) took place.
Cytotoxicity assays in the HEK293 cell line showed a high viability for most metal-
losurfactants. A higher toxicity was found for the surfactants with long unsaturated
hydrocarbon chains, while tocopherol and steroid-based lipids gave similar cyto-
toxicity values. In vitro transfection results with HEK293 and HepG2 cell lines also
depended on the type of hydrocarbon tails. The best efficiency value was obtained
with the linear hydrocarbon chain containing 16 carbon atoms and with unsaturated
bonds in the hydrocarbon chain. The presence of tocopherol in the lipids provoked
higher transfection efficiency in comparison with steroid-based lipids. The cellular
uptake was studied from flow cytometry and the intracellular fate after endocytosis
was carried out by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The internalization of the
plasmid by endocytosis process was confirmed. Besides, DNA was found to be deliv-
ered and released around the cell nuclei. This indicated the nucleic acid scape from
the endosome. In any case, the transfection mechanism by these lipids needs a more
thorough study.
Recently, Kaur et al. [81] synthesized spherical metallosomes, of multivesicular
nature, from cholesterol and double-chained metallosurfactans by mixing the cor-
responding metallic salt (iron, cobalt, nickel, and copper) and the lipid cetyl pyri-
dinium chloride with 1 : 2 stoichiometry. The metal influenced the type of metallo-
some prepared: unilamellar vesicles for Fe and multilamellar vesicles for Cu, Ni, and
Co. Aggregates with other stoichiometries (1 : 3 and 1 : 4), as well as metallosomes
without cholesterol, were also generated to give spherical, multivesicular metallo-
somes.
The intercalating nature of the metallosomes and a groove binding mode with
ct-DNA resulted in a strong interaction of the aggregates with the polynucleotide,
more efficient with Cu metallosomes than with those based on Fe, Co, and Ni.
Changes in the zeta potential values of the metallosome/DNA complexes were
observed depending on the metal ion embedded in the aggregates as counter ion.
Conformational and structural changes in DNA were also obtained from gel elec-
trophoresis assays. This confirmed the possibility of using these metallosurfactants
in gene therapy processes.
Aggregates with other stoichiometries seemed to give spherical metallosomes, but
up till now they have not been used in biomedical applications.

Future Perspectives
Interesting investigations about the preparation of metallosurfactants, and the inter-
actions of their monomers as well as their aggregates with DNA, have been carried
out. Stability, low cytotoxicity, biodegradability, and good transfection efficiency val-
ues were obtained for some of them. Results show that the synergistic effect between
the properties of the metal ions and those of the amphiphilic tails can lead to enhanc-
ing and improving their interest in biomedical applications, especially in anticancer
and gene therapies.
Besides, transfection processes occur according to mechanisms still unknown.
Both the endocytosis pathways and the mechanism of intracellular internalization
processes need to be elucidated. In vivo assays and clinical trials need to be per-
formed to demonstrate the advantages that metallosurfactants could provide in
biomedicine.
Bearing this in mind, more studies are required on metal surfactants. The design
and synthesis of novel gene carriers, but also in vitro and in vivo assays are essential
to clarify all the issues mentioned above. Molecular dynamic studies will be also
welcome.

Introduction
Amphiphiles constitute a very special class of soft materials, known to mankind
since many centuries in the capacity of soaps, detergents, wetting agents, and emul-
sifiers. A single molecule of surfactant possesses two different kinds of chemical
nature, i.e. a part of the molecule is hydrophobic, while the other is hydrophilic
[1]. The competitive and balancing forces between the two lead to many interesting
and useful properties. Perhaps the most fundamental and fascinating property
of the surfactants/amphiphiles is the self-assembly and ability to get adsorbed
at interfaces such as the air/water. Beyond a particular threshold, they tend to
assemble in rather intricate structures, with “micelle” being the simplest of them
all. At still higher concentrations, liquid crystalline phases are formed. However,
conventional surfactants are predominantly naive in terms of chemical reactivity,
and hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance of the system tends to impart them their
unique properties [2].
“Metallosurfactants” represent new class of materials in which the polar head-
group of the surfactant molecule contains a transition/inner-transition metal center
as an integral structural component, while in a few cases it may also be present in the
hydrophobic part [3]. Metallosurfactants can be broadly categorized into two sub-
groups; one with metal ion as an integral part of the head group of surfactants, while
the other one contains metal as counter ion along with amphiphilic part. The incor-
poration of d- and f-block metal ions into amphiphilic structures brings features like
bright colors, redox nature, and paramagnetism to the conventional surfactants [4].
In addition to the above properties, the self-assembly of surfactants aids in formation
of well-defined metal complex aggregates of nuclearities equal to the aggregation
number of the micelles themselves (Figure 9.1) [5]. These surfactants are rarely

compared with the traditional surfactants but have established substantial potential
applications in multifarious fields such as magnetic resonance imaging, molecular
machine for porous materials, thin-film optoelectronics, interfacial photophysics,
and homogeneous catalysis. [4].
There is dearth of research in investigating the role of metallosurfactants in the
field of nano synthesis. The knowledge is limited on their potential use as nanoscale
reactors for the fabrication of nanostructures and their subsequent modification to
impart the desired functionality on nanoparticles (NPs) [6]. Nanometal and semi-
conductor colloids have attracted considerable interest due to their well-defined
morphology, size-dependent characteristics, optical and electronic properties,
which finally lead to prospective applications in optoelectronics, catalysis, reprogra-
phy, etc. Clearly, the nanoregime has infiltrated our daily lives, but there will still be
a lack of simple synthetic approaches for nanostructure fabrication. Conventional
synthetic routes to metallic nanostructures are restricted and are followed by several
drawbacks, including cost effectiveness, waste generation, use of harsh chemicals,
pH stabilization, higher temperature and pressure requirements, presence of inert
atmosphere during the synthesis process, to name a few. Therefore, it is of utmost
importance that facile, cheap, and environmentally sustainable methodologies be
established for nanostructure synthesis [4].
Metallosurfactants are suitable alternatives because they fulfill the above require-
ments and deliver a range of advantages over traditional synthetic processes. The
distinctive nature of metal surfactant complex to act as both a metal ion source and
NPs protector opens up a new arena of synthesis thus eliminating the necessity for
any stabilizing or capping agent. Thus, this study focuses on the applicability and
modification of metallosurfactants as building blocks for NPs synthesis.

Synthesis
9.2.1
Colloidal Synthesis
Synthesis procedures involving NPs fabrication must provide the stability, shape,
and size control to the generating NPs. The most common problem is the surface
passivation or shape mediation of the nanomaterials. However, there are a number
of shape controlling/directing agents reported in the literature, viz. polymers, sur-
factants, biomolecules, etc. but the role of ionic surfactants in NP generation is most
explored and well understood. In a general synthetic procedure, metal ion (Mn+)
is firstly reduced to its zero valent state (M0) by suitable reducing agent. M0 atoms
thus formed tiny nucleating centers, and at this stage surfactants play an active role
to control their growth by getting preferentially adsorbed on the surface of growing
nanocrystals (Figure 9.2) [7].
Mandeep S. Bakhsi [8] thoroughly investigated the role of ionic surfactants in
nanocrystal growth. It was established that selective adsorption of ionic surfactant
on [100] plane rather than on [111] plane results in anisotropic growth of nanoma-
terials. Generally, polar head group of the surfactant gets adsorbed on the charged
NPs surface due to electrostatic interactions, which is followed by bilayer formation
owing to a hydrophobic stability in aqueous media. However, optimization of
surfactant concentration, reaction temperature, pH of the media (ionic strength of
the reaction medium), point of surfactant injection, time of the reaction, etc. is still a
matter of concern. Another aspect associated with surfactant-assisted NP synthesis
is diffusion-controlled motion of surfactant molecules, which is governed by
solvents properties like dielectric constant, polarity, and viscosity. Metal-decorated
surfactant complexes provide solution to some of the above-raised questions and
prove to be one molecule precursor for NPs synthesis. In metallosurfactants,
metal ion is closely associated with surfactant moiety; thus, it can provide metal
ion as well as shape-directing agent, i.e. surfactant needed for the production of
homogeneous NPs.
In this regard, Lisiecki and Pileni [9, 10] presented the synthesis of copper
metallic clusters in reverse micellar media of Cu(AOT)2 surfactant (AOT = dioctyl
sulfosuccinate). Reverse micelle solution was prepared by dissolving only the

sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate (AOT) surfactant as well as mixture of AOT
and Cu(AOT)2 complex in isooctane. Addition of an aqueous solution of reducing
agent to the medium produced metallic copper particles surrounded by a copper
oxide layer and pure copper oxide particles. Change in the shape of surfactant
aggregates modified the shape of metallic clusters as well. It was established that by
increasing the water content in the core of aggregates, size of the NPs also increased
as indicated by the shift in surface plasmon resonance peak in ultra violet (UV)–vis
spectrum. Even the change in solvent can lead to a change in the shape and size of
the particles. Interactions between aggregate droplets formed in isooctane and in
cyclohexane were different, and produced smaller-sized copper NPs.
In another report, copper NPs were generated from copper dodecyl sulfate with the
help of sodium borohydride [10]. Size of NPs originating from surfactant-assisted
method strongly depends upon CMC. Below CMC, copper oxide NPs (30 nm) and
at/above CMC, copper metallic NPs (280 nm) were obtained (Figure 9.3).

Then, in 1997, AOT complexed Cd, Mn, and Zn were employed for the fabrication
of Cd1−yMnyS magnetic semiconductor clusters and CdyZn1−yS nanosized particles
by Levy et al. [11] and Cizeron and Pileni [12]. CdyZn1−yS NPs were obtained
immediately after mixing of three micellar solutions, viz. AOT-containing sulfide
ions (Na2S), Zn(AOT)2, and Cd(AOT)2. Likewise, Cd1−yMnyS nanoclusters were
also prepared by coprecipitating the micellar solution of the desired components.
Instant formation of NPs on mixing of micellar media attributed to the dynamic
properties of reversely aggregated surfactants. The authors concluded that reverse
micelles proved to be efficient microreactors for the fabrication of size and
shape-controlled NPs.
Further, Tanori et al. [13] produced pure copper metallic as well as Fe–Cu
alloy nanosized particles. For the synthesis, 0.1 M solution of Fe(AOT)2 (30%) and
Cu(AOT)2 (70%) was prepared in isooctane and mixed with 0.2 M NaBH4. The
solution was kept under constant stirring until black precipitates appeared, followed
by washing with isooctane and acetone. Particle size/shape was monitored based on
the water content present inside the reverse micellar phase. At low water concentra-
tion, metal ions were not fully hydrated and thus available for crystal growth, and
vice versa when water amount increases. Talking about the shape, as the content
of water increases, shape transition takes place from spherical to cylindrical to rod
like; however, at very high concentration again spherical NPs were obtained.
AOT surfactant complex with Ag and Zn also yielded Ag and Zn NPs. In connec-
tion with this, Bagwe and Khilar [14] studied the inter-micellar exchange rate of the
synthesis of Ag-AOT-assisted synthesis of silver chloride NPs. Exchange rate consid-
erably affects the size of the NPs, with NPs being smaller sized at higher exchange
rate and bigger at lower exchange rate.
Later on, silver nanodisks were obtained by mixing equal amount of Ag(AOT) and
Na(AOT) by Maillard et al. [15], while Quinlan et al. [16] described the synthesis of
ZnSe NPs having radii lesser than that of Bohr exciton from reverse micellar solution
of Zn(AOT)2 complex and NaSe2. Size of the synthesized NPs was in the range of
3.3–3.5 nm, supporting the fact that reverse micellar approach leads to a narrow size
distribution.
Advancing the phenomena, Wang et al. [17] combined the ionic liquids with
metallosurfactants to produce nanoceria. Metallosurfactant ionogels, i.e. gelation
behavior of hexadecylpyridinium ion [Cp]+ with different counter ions, i.e. Br−,
[FeCl3Br]−, [CeCl3Br]−was checked in various imidazolium ionic liquids. In the
presence of ethylammonium nitrate, [CeCl3Br]−[Cp]+ yielded ceria (CeO2) NPs
of diverse sizes (Figure 9.4). CeO2 NPs possessed oxidase and peroxidase activity
and proved to be an efficient catalyst for decomposition of H2O2. Bubbling of O2
got enhanced over the passage of time with the decomposition of H2O2, and the
phenomenon was captured by optical microscopy.
Presence of metal ion along with closely associated surfactant moiety thus
produced uniform NPs in terms of size and shape number of other organometallic
compounds having amphiphilic character. In this direction, Torigoe and Esumi [18]
fabricated gold NPs from water-insoluble ionic mixture of AuCl4
−with some
cationic surfactants, viz. dodecyl and hexadecylpyridinium chloride (DPCl, CPCl),

dodecyl and hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride surfactants (dodecyltrimethy-
lammonium chloride [DTAC], cetyltrimethylammonium chloride [CTAC]). Net
interaction between auric salt, i.e. HAuCl4⋅4H2O with the corresponding surfac-
tant resulted in the formation of metallosurfactant of the type [Surf]+ [AuCl4]−.
To prepare the gold colloidal sol, the metallosurfactant solution of particular
concentration was irradiated with UV radiation. Pyridinium group was strongly
adsorbed onto the surface of NPs; thus, DPCl and CPCl were found to be more
effective in controlling shape and size of gold nanocolloids as compared to other
two mentioned surfactants. Further, long alkyl chain was found to be more effective
in providing protection to the gold sol as indicated by the long-lived transition state
of [CP+][AuCl4]−during photolysis, which can only be explained by assuming
that CPCl forms a thick adsorption layer around the growing particles; hence,
homogeneously dispersed gold NPs were obtained (Figure 9.5).
Similarly, Kameo et al. [19] reported the production of gold fibers by radiating a
solution of AuCl4 and alkyltrimethylammoniumchlorides (CnTAC) with UV light
where n = 10, 12, 14, 16. The authors concluded that as the length of alkyl chain of
the surfactant increases, length of gold nanofibers also increases.
Contrary to this, size of cubooctahedral-shaped Pd NPs decreased with increase
in chain length of the surfactant as reported by Veisz and Király [20]. The Pd
colloidal particles were synthesized from metallomicelle of the surfactants-type
[CnTA]2−[PdBr4]2+, where the value of n varies from 8 to 16. Reduction of the
metallosurfactant solution was carried out by hydrazine. Long-term stability of Pd
hydrosol was ensured by the bilayer protection of surfactants around the NPs. Size
of the NPs not only depends on the length of the alkyl chain but also varies as a
function of surfactant and Pd precursor concentration. A lesser amount of both
precursor and surfactant concentration results in smaller-sized particles.

Zero valent Pd NPs were also prepared from palladium complexed with
n-octylethylenediamine surfactant, i.e. [Pd(oct-en)2]Cl2. Synthesis was achieved
in W/O micro-emulsion of [Pd(oct-en)2]Cl2/water/CHCl3. Again the sizes
of the NPs were found to be sensitive toward the solvent content inside the
reverse micellar structure and concentration of NaBH4, the reductant. In 2001,
Manna et al. [21] came up with a scheme (Figure 9.6.) describing utilization of
N-hexadecylethlenediamine silver nitrate complex as precursor for generating silver
NPs. Synthesis was carried out in two-phase redox reaction, i.e. n-heptane/water
mixture. The authors highlighted the importance of metal–hybrid surfactant as an
in situ phase transfer catalyst required during the two-phase redox reaction. Further,
silver–surfactant complex was found to be very useful in developing 2D monolayers
and Langmuir–Blodgett films of silver particles having different valences.
Then, in 2005, Sathyamurthy et al. [22] synthesized room-temperature photolumi-
nescent ceria NPs in water in oil microemulsion from cetyltrimethylammonium bro-
mide (CTAB)–Ce complex. For oil phase, n-octane was selected, while butanol and
aqueous solution acted as co-surfactant in dispersed phase, respectively (Figure 9.7).
CTAB was reported as one of the highly coordinating cationic surfactants and for-
mation of reverse micelle provided protection to the growing NPs. A peculiar feature
about the photoluminescence of the ceria NPs was that dilution led to the red shifting
the emission peak (Figure 9.7c).
In another interesting work, gold nanocrystals were prepared from TPAuFO
organometallic compound [23]. Here, TP stands for triphenylphosphine, while FO
was perfluorooctanoate. Published work was one of its kind and contained the
information about the use of single phase supercritical fluid, i.e. scCO2. Schematic
representation of the apparatus employed by the authors for synthesis of gold
NPs in scCO2 along with the chemical structure of amphiphilic organoauric(III)
complex as shown in the Figure 9.8. Reduction with dimethyl amine borane in
above-mentioned method yielded the gold NPs as small as 1 nm (Figure 9.8).

Likewise bis-cyclooctatetraene titanium precursor, i.e. Ti(COT)2 organometallic
complex was exploited for the production of titania NPs [24]. Ti(COT)2 was refluxed
with different surfactants, viz. tributylphosphine (TBP), tributylphosphine oxide
(TBPO), trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) in dichlorobenzene. Color of the solution
changed from dark red to pale yellow on addition of dimethyl sulfoxide indicating
the formation of titania NPs. A noticeable fact was that color change appeared
almost immediately at 120 ∘C but took two days when the reaction mixture was
refluxed at room temperature. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images
confirmed that TiO2 nanocrystals were internally crystalline, highly monodispersed
and 15 nm in size (Figure 9.9a). Nanocrystals were very soluble in the reaction
medium and difficult to separate, hence, X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the
material could not be recorded, nevertheless selected area electron diffraction
(SAED) pattern confirmed the internal phase as well as crystallinity of the TiO2
nanocrystals (Figure 9.9b). A clear examination of SAED pattern revealed that TiO2
NPs crystallized dominantly into brookite phase.
Successful synthesis of differently sized 3, 5, 7, 9 nm magnetite NPs was achieved
by dissolving iron precursors (Fe2+ and Fe3+) in a turbid water in oil emulsion of
sodium dodecyl benzenesulfonate in xylene [25]. The reaction was heated up to
90 ∘C and then addition of hydrazine led to the formation of black precipitates,
the iron NPs. The authors reported a very economical and environment-friendly
approach for the synthesis of highly crystalline iron NPs. Beauty of the reaction

was that within a single reaction, multi-gram production of NPs was achieved,
which could be further scaled up for higher yield. The same methodology suited
the fabrication of mixed metal ferrites like cobalt, nickel, zinc ferrite.
A significant contribution into the field of fabrication of highly crystalline and
monodispersed NPs was made by Park et al. [26]. Metal oleate complex was synthe-
sized by reacting the FeCl3⋅H2O and sodium oleate in a mixture of ethanol, water,
and hexane. Then, to obtain iron nanocrystals, iron–oleate organometallic complex

along with the oleic acid was heated at 320 ∘C. At this temperature, abrupt reaction
took place resulting in appearance of black-colored precipitates in contrast to the
initial transparent solution. Similar treatment led to the synthesis of MnO and CoO
nanocrystals. It was observed that γ-Fe2O3 was the dominating phase in iron oxide
NPs, and content of Fe3O4 gradually increased as the size of NPs increases. All the
presented NPs were highly segregated, crystalline, and uniform in size and shape,
affirming the authenticity of the metal–oleate complex as an effective precursor for
nanomaterial production.
9.2.2
Thermal Decomposition
Thermal decomposition route is one of the most attractive approaches for NP synthe-
sis. The low decomposition temperature of the metal complexes can be fairly used in
the fabrication of metal NPs via thermal treatment. This facile process can be applied
to metal surfactant complexes to yield monodisperse and uniform NPs.
Hyeon et al. [27, 28] extensively worked on the synthesis of nanomaterials from
surfactant–metal complex. Iron oxide, iron-cobalt mixed ferrite NPs were prepared
by thermal pyrolysis of metal oleate complex (Figure 9.10.). Synthetic procedure
reported by the scientist has several advantages over the conventional methods for
NPs synthesis. Firstly, the method provided a size selection free methodology as
monodispersed NPs were obtained, so no special efforts were needed for NPs syn-
thesis of desired size and shape. Secondly, NPs did not show any aggregation when
dissolved in different organic media, which further justified the effectiveness of met-
allosurfactants as two in one precursor for NPs. Lastly, reproducibility of the syn-
thetic procedure was excellent and slight modification of reaction parameters could
provide NPs of preferred shape and size.
Metal–oleylamine complex was further exploited in synthesis of semiconducting

nanocrystals of PbS, ZnS, CdS, and MnS with various dimensions and morphology
from the thermal reaction of metal chloride and sulfur in oleylamine (Figure 9.11).
The shape of the nanocrystals was controlled by changing the metal complex
to sulfur ratio to form highly crystalline rods, bipods, tripods, and bullets. The
synthetic thermal decomposition procedures developed in this study offer several
very important advantageous features for the synthesis of sulfide nanocrystals.
Firstly, it uses cheap and commercially available metal chlorides and sulfur with
easy scale-up. Secondly, this generalized process can be applied to a wide variety of
reactions to generate sulfide nanocrystals with different uniform shapes and sizes.

Biphasic Redox Reaction
Kaur and Mehta [30] synthesized Fe, Co, Cu, Ni, Zn metal nanostructures in
heptane/water biphasic media from metallosurfactants and successfully charac-
terized by UV–vis spectra, TEM analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR) spectroscopy, which was further supported by density functional theory
(DFT) studies. First indication about the formation of NPs was given by an instant
change in color on addition of aqueous solution of NaBH4 in heptane-containing
solution of [M(CH3COO)4] [C12H25NH3]2 (Figure 9.12). Their study revealed
that capping mechanism or preferences are different for different metallic nanos-
tructures, i.e. Fe, Zn were protected by carboxylate moiety, while Cu, Co, Ni
had alkylamine capping. As a result of which Fe, Zn NPs remained dispersed in
aqueous layer, but Cu, Co, Ni were dispersed in heptane. Further, shape of the
metallomicelle was totally reflected in the shape of NPs. Elliptical metalloag-
gregate of Zn-surfactant complex generated capsule-like nanostructure, whereas
spherical metallomicelle (Fe, Cu, Co, Ni) yielded spherical NPs. Catalytically,
the efficiency of NPs in conversion of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol followed
the Co > Ni > Cu > Zn > Fe order. Kaur et al. not only contributed to this field

experimentally but also critically reviewed the role of metallosurfactant in
fabrication of various types of nanomaterials.
In 2018, Kaur et al. [31] used metallosurfactants to synthesize Pd–Ni alloy NPs
with uniform shape and dimensions. They employed two-phase redox methodology
forming mixed reverse metallomicelles fabricated from Pd and Ni metallosurfac-
tants. The metal heads assembled in the cores were subsequently reduced by NaBH4
to form zerovalent metal atoms. The spherical morphology of the bimetallic NPs was
confirmed by TEM images with an average size of 5 nm as shown in Figure 9.13.
In another report [32], the authors investigated ligand insertion method to syn-
thesize novel double-chained metallocomplex bisdodecylaminepalladium(II) chlo-
ride [Pd(C12H25NH2)2]Cl2. This complex was further utilized to form Pd NPs by
a two-phase (water/dichloromethane [DCM]) redox reaction (Figure 9.14). NaBH4
was employed as a reducing agent for metal ions to form zerovalent metallic state.
The surfactant layer on the NPs prevented the agglomeration of Pd(0) and led to the
formation of monodispersed spherical NPs of 3–5 nm as shown in TEM analysis.
Hence, it can be inferred that metallosurfactants play a vital role as reactors for
nanoparticle synthesis. By varying the amount of precursors or the reaction condi-
tions, diverse types of metal nanoparticles can be obtained as shown in Table 9.1.

Future Perspective
By utilizing metal–surfactant complex as a precursor for NPs fabrication, a num-
ber of concerns were resolved like homogeneity, reproducibility, flexibility, and
environmental issues. However, it is still difficult to produce pure metallic NPs of
certain metals like copper as copper is very much prone to the air/solvent oxidation.
Thus, a methodology might be undertaken to produce metallic copper NPs, but it
may result in copper oxide NPs formation eventually. Kaur et al. [30, 41] provided
a remedy to this problem, using metallosurfactants. The method proposed by them
delivers extreme stability to the colloidal sol even in the aqueous environment. To
achieve the unmatchable stability copper surfactant, [Cu(CH3COO)4][C12H25NH3]2
was mixed with poly acrylic acid (PAA). Then, the solution was subjected to vigorous

stirring, and reducing agent NaBH4 was added to the reaction mixture (Figure 9.15).
Appearance of reddish color indicated the formation of copper colloids in zero
valent state. Copper NPs thus formed were found to be stable even after a month. A
size control on the size of copper metallic NPs could be attained by just varying the
concentration of PAA. Homogeneously dispersed NPs were employed as catalyst
for the redox reaction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol conversion in aqueous
medium. Hence, metallosurfactants have paved a way for new mechanistic studies
for nanostructure formation with homogeneity and reproducibility, which will help
in overcoming the drawbacks of conventional methods.
9.4
Conclusion
It can be effectively inferred that logical design and modification provide the possi-
bility of regulating the unique characteristics of metallosurfactants. The structural
architecture of the metallosurfactant can be precisely tuned to cater the require-
ments and specifications of the applications. Solid-state metallosurfactants and
even self-assembled frameworks obtained in solution form can be used effectively in
synthesizing NPs because of their surface dynamism. As a result, the self-assembly
mechanism of these metallosurfactants offers a variety of morphologies resulting
in a consistent and monitored arrangement of functionalized or derived nanos-
tructures. This approach offers many advantages over traditional NPs fabrication
methods such as (i) facile and cost-effective methodology without any extreme
temperature/pressure conditions, (ii) controlled structural morphology, and (iii)
absence of any templating or capping agent to name a few. Due to its ameliorat-
ing properties, this subject area has rightly drawn scientific attention from both
organometallic and nanoscience arenas. This can pave a way for new breakthroughs
in the field of surfactant and nanochemistry by serving as a connection between
two disciplines.

Introduction
Surfactants, the surface-active agents, are amphiphilic compounds that render
special properties owing to their ability to solubilize in both polar and non-polar
solvents. They have the unique ability to gather themselves at a particular con-
centration to form aggregates. This ability of self-aggregation of the surfactants
in the presence of metal into metalloaggregates was first described in the 1980s
[1], and since then metallosurfactants have been extensively studied for diverse
applications ranging from electron storage systems in photo-redox processes to
biological applications [2]. Although surfactants themselves can be used in the
development of many drugs, the incorporation of metal ions gives a fascinating
blend with desired properties. The surface of metal surfactants leads to change in
surface conformation that affects the biological function of the DNA or protein
(building blocks of the living systems), which can be exploited in therapeutics.
Biologically active metal complexes are of prodigious significance in medical field
as a reasonable substitute to organic compounds accompanied by acute side effects.
Although the metallosurfactants exhibit numerous captivating properties, their
prospects in the medicinal applications have not yet been fully explored and are a
relatively new research field.
Medicinal inorganic chemistry is still a juvenile discipline, which consists of
escalating pharmacopeia of therapeutic and diagnostic agents having metal ions,
an insight into their metabolism and mode of action [3]. It is nearly impractical to
study this field without taking into consideration some of the metallocomplexes (or
ligands alone, anticipated to bind to endogenous metal ions) that are in different
stages of development. The most common example that is cited is of platinum
compounds, cisplatin (cis-[Pt(NH3)2Cl2]), carboplatin, and oxaliplatin, used for the
treatment of cancer. Although prescribed on limited basis, Auranofin, is another
metal-based therapeutic, which is used for relieving arthritis pain. A technetium
radiopharmaceutical, 99mTc-pertechnetate [99mTcO4]−, is an indispensable part of

radio diagnosis. Lanthanides and transition metals (Gd, Fe, Mn) as paramagnetic
contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging have opened new horizons by the
development of novel complexes having the aptitude to target specific tissues and
physiological states [3].
The interactions of the organic amphiphiles with the living organisms and the
cell membranes are extensively studied in literature [4, 5]. The metallosurfactants
have demonstrated capacity for expansion as contemporary and effectual therapeu-
tic agents. Research is being done to understand the variations in the microenviron-
ment of an amphiphilic metal in comparison to the non-amphiphilic metal complex
and its effect on the biological activity. Efforts are concerted to unravel the reasons
that lead to the enhancement in the activity of the self-assembly of metallosurfac-
tants as compared to the non-aggregated compounds.
The chapter primarily focusses on two main biological attributes of the metallosur-
factants, namely, the antimicrobial efficacy and the potential to combat the deadly
cancer (Figure 10.1).
10.2
Antimicrobial Activity
Infections have plagued mankind since the birth, which represent a major concern
for global health so far. Hence, the treatment of infections is one of the crucial solici-
tudes of medical professionals. The rapid emergence of resistant microbes occurring
worldwide is making the problem further complicated by endangering the efficacy
of antibiotics. Some of the newly developed antibiotics, such as oxazolidinone (line-
zolid), streptomycin (quinupridine/dalfopristin), and glycolipid (daptomycin), have

181
an activity range limited to Gram-positive pathogens. For scientists, this presents
a challenge to design antibiotics with unique properties and more effective action
mechanisms.
The mesmerizing world of metallosurfactants plays a key role in the development
of new genre of pharmaceutically active agents, which offer a promising approach
to combat the increasing microbial resistance. The hydrophobicity of microbial cell
membrane is attributed to their unique structure consisting of lipids or proteins
arranged in a bilayer making the membrane selectively permeable. This controls
all the biological activities occurring in the microbes. Any aspect that manipulates
the functioning of membrane proves fatal. Cationic metallosurfactants have been in
the limelight recently owing to their ability to self-assemble into a supramolecular
structure having sharp polarity gradient at the interface and obvious hydrophobic
area in the aqueous solution.
10.2.1
Metallosurfactants Effective against Bacteria
McDonnell and Russell [6] endorsed the fact that cationic surfactants exhibit antimi-
crobial properties, which are based on their aptitude to disturb the bacterial mem-
brane by cumulative hydrophobic and electrostatic adsorption phenomenon at the
membrane water interface. Pathogens primarily have negatively charged membrane,
which facilitates their interactions with the positively charged cationic amphiphiles
lending them biocidal activity. The amphiphiles adsorb at the interface of water-cell
membrane, which leads to disruption of biochemical reactions or metabolic path-
way occurring within the cell cytoplasm [7, 8]. The consequent physical disruption
is due to the incursion of the hydrophobic chains into the cellular membrane due to
their similarity in chemical nature and structure.
Antimicrobial ferrosurfactants (-di[chlorium ferriate] complexes of morpholin-4-
yl-alkan-1-one) prepared by Aiad et al. [9] demonstrate good inhibition properties
for microorganisms (Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria, and some fungal
strains as mold and yeast).
The length of the hydrophobic chain of amphiphiles significantly affects the bio-
logical activity of the metallosurfactant. As the hydrophobicity increases, biological
activity also increases. This fact is endorsed by Adawy and Khowdiary [10] in their
work where they have prepared metallocationic surfactants by complexing the qua-
ternary ammonium salt with nickel(II) and copper(II) chlorides. Out of the two
metals used, copper exhibits higher activity, which has been attributed to its lower
electronegativity and a larger volume [11].
According to Hafiz [12], metallosurfactant complexes tend to dissolve and
disintegrate the constituents of biological membranes. The intake capacity of the
surfactants is influenced by critical micelle concentration (CMC). It is observed that
the metallo amphiphiles having large-sized micelles at lower CMC are more favor-
able from biological perspective. The complex undertaken was benzyl triphenyl
phosphonium chlorometallate having copper or iron ions. The metalloamphiphiles
exhibit antibacterial activity against the growth of Gram-positive and Gram-negative
bacteria.

10 Metallosurfactants and Their Biological Attributes: Anticancer and Antimicrobial Properties
The literature shows that cationic surfactants as derivatives of quaternary
ammonium salts (+1 charge) have biological activity [13]. However, until recently,
there have been few studies on similar water-soluble molecules with a higher
charge on the head group. Behm et al. [14] synthesized a series of highly charged
large bicyclic caged cobalt complexes with lipophilic substituents. The authors
propose that this molecule can affect membranes in many ways. The high charge
(+3) and the size of the head group may affect the electron transport system
bound to the membrane or inactivate the negative binding site on the enzyme. It is
observed that compounds with paraffin tails (C-8) or larger can pierce biofilms. The
synthesized amphiphiles were tested for ectoparasites, nematodes, trematodes, and
protozoa. They show surprising effects on observed organisms even at millimolar
concentrations. Amphiphiles having long single paraffin tails (>C10 or equivalent)
or bifurcated tails are effective in killing the parasites. On the other hand, molecules
having smaller chains/lower lipophilicity are found to be ineffective. Biodistribu-
tion studies revealed that unlike organic compounds, the metallo amphiphiles are
confined to the gastrointestinal tract, which implies that this would be an effective
method for the treatment of gastrointestinal parasites.
10.2.2
Metallosurfactants Effective Against Fungus
Kumar and Arunachalam [15, 16] developed a new type of antibacterial metal
amphiphile-
cis-[Co(X)2(C14H29NH2)Cl]2+
and
cis-[Co(X)2(C11H23NH2)]-type
cobalt(III) complex ion containing N,N-donor ligand (X = ethylenediamine
(en), bpy, phen or X2 = trien). The synthetic complex binds to DNA and also
inhibits the growth of certain bacterial and fungal species. They were tested for
Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis) and Gram-negative
bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Candida albicans
(pathogenic yeast). The complex encompassing trien ligand has high activity
against all tested species, so its performance is better than other ligands.
Organic compounds containing heterocycles are known to be active pharmaceu-
tical agents in most of the biocidal drugs. Derivatives of pyrazole are of great sig-
nificance because they portray considerable anticancer, anti-HIV, antibacterial [17],
monoamine oxidase inhibitory activity [18], insecticidal and herbicidal properties.
Considering this, Negm et al. [19] synthesized copper and tin complexes of pyra-
zolium derivatives (Figure 10.2) having different substituents. The cationic surfac-
tants without metal illustrate reasonable antibacterial (S. aureus and E. coli) activity,
with A = H and B = CH3 being the most active compounds. However on complex-
ation with metal ions (i.e. [MCl2Br2]2−counterions), the activity increased tremen-
dously. It is observed that complexes having a higher positive charge on the nitrogen
atoms exhibit lower activity against the tested microorganisms and vice versa, which
in turn is dependent on the electropositivity of the metal ions. The amphiphiles were
found to be active against the fungus C. albicans, but not against Aspergillus flavus.
The resistance toward the latter fungus was attributed to the rigid outer membrane of
the fungus. In this case also, the antifungal activity was found to be enhanced upon

complexation with metal ions. In addition to this, it is seen that the resistance of
A. flavus began to decrease for the metal complexes reflecting their higher potency.
Chandar et al. [20] screened cobalt-containing Schiff bases and their complexes for
biological activities. Under identical conditions, they exhibit higher activity than the
corresponding free ligands against pathogenic bacterial and fungal species. Chela-
tion decreases the polarity of metal ion, thereby increasing its permeation through
the lipid bilayer [21].
Negm et al. [19] also used Schiff base cationic surfactants with the complexes
of divalent Co, Cu, and Mn transition metal ions. Different Schiff bases were syn-
thesized using four fatty amines that included dodecyl, tetradecyl, hexadecyl, and
octadecyl amine in association with 4-diethyl aminobenzaldehyde. The antibacterial
and antifungal properties of the cationic surfactants were then evaluated against sev-
eral bacterial and fungal strains, which included: S. Auerus, Staphylococcus typhus,
Bacillus subtilis, E. coli, Aspergillus niger, and A. flavus. The process of adsorption
eases penetration of amphiphiles into the cellular membranes. The positive charge
on the head group of surfactant molecules stabilizes their adsorption by the inter-
action with the negative charges on the cellular membranes. Compared with their
metal counterparts, it can be seen that the latter has higher biocidal activity than its
parent, which is due to the polarity of the Schiff base in the form of cation and the
positive charge (N+) on the nitrogen atom. This is explained based on the concept
of overtone [22, 23] and chelation theory [24].
The overtone theory states that the lipid component in the cell membrane aids
the channel of fat-soluble substances. According to the chelation theory, the polar-
ity of the metal ion is largely reduced, due to the overlap between the ligand orbitals
and the partial sharing of the positive charge of the metal ion with the donor group.
This increases the delocalization of Π electrons on the chelating ring, which in turn
enhances the lipophilicity of the complex. The lipophilicity of metal complexes aug-
ments their capacity to penetrate lipid membranes and blocks metal-binding sites
on microbial enzymes. Therefore, the bactericidal activity is higher than that of the
parent compound.
Among different metals used, Cu(II) was found to show highest activity, which is
in accordance with the previous studies by the same group. High electronegativity
(Cu > Co > Mn) and large atomic radius (Cu > Co > Mn) facilitate the absorption of
electron density from nitrogen donor atoms, which leads to increased hydrophobic-
ity and bactericidal activity of the corresponding metal complexes. Besides this as
discussed earlier, the hydrophobic chain length also has an important effect on the
potency of metalloamphiphiles.

10 Metallosurfactants and Their Biological Attributes: Anticancer and Antimicrobial Properties
Antibacterial and antifungal activities of some nonionic Schiff bases having Cu(II)
and Fe(III) have been explored by Negm group [25]. The biocidal action of Schiff’s
bases is found to be directly proportional to their hydrophobic chain length. As
anticipated, the metal chelates showed increased antibacterial and antifungal activ-
ity compared to the free ligand. This is attributable to enhanced cell permeability,
which in turn is related to delocalization of electrons over Schiff’s base that increases
the hydrophobicity of alkyl chain. However, the biological activities of the prepared
metal complexes diminished on increasing the hydrocarbon chain length, which is
due to the adsorption ability of the complexes containing long chains at the inter-
faces due to which they form micelles. This decreases their biological activities as
compared to amphiphiles with shorter hydrocarbon chain lengths. Among the two
metals, Cu(II) complexes showed higher activity against bacteria and fungi, which
was attributed to the electronic configuration of the tridentate complex. This could
further lead to the fact that antibacterial and antifungal activities are related to the
molecular structure of the ligands and the captivity of the complex formed [26, 27].
Metal ions increase the biological attributes of already-known molecules was
also supported by another study [28]. Ni(II) complexed with anionic Schiff
base amphiphiles were explored against S. aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes
as Gram-positive and Pseudomonas phaseolicola, Pseudomonas fluorescens as
Gram-negative bacteria. As expected, the biological active compounds become
more bacteriostatic and carcinostatic upon chelation with metal ions.
Recently, metal complexes of natural peptides have garnered significant interest
as they exhibit an array of antimicrobial properties through structural changes of
peptides upon metal binding and redox chemistry.
Antimicrobial peptides (AMP) are usually short chains (less than 50 amino acid
residues), consisting of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains, and exhibiting
cogent cationic properties. They are, thus, often referred as cationic antimicrobial
peptides (CAMP) [29, 30]. The net positive charge ensures remarkable collabora-
tion with the negative charge residing on the bacterial membranes depicting sub-
stantial specificity and genetic variability. They are known to cause bacterial cell
death through either membranolytic and non-membranolytic mechanisms or even
through the interaction with intracellular targets, such as DNA, RNA, and proteins.
Four main models of (inner) membrane perturbation have been proposed: aggre-
gate, toroidal pore, barrel-stave, and carpet models. However, their metal complexes
present different mechanism of actions. They can lead to destruction of bacterial
plasma membranes as well as hydrolytic or oxidative cleavage of nucleic acids, which
is usually promoted by metal-based aggregation [31].
The widely explored metal AMP motif is the amino terminal Cu(II)- and Ni(II)
(ATCUN) having binding sequence with an XXH stretch, an amino terminal, where
X is any amino acid.
Another family of potent AMPs are the Piscidins found in the teleosts. Piscidin 1,
P1 (FFHHIFRGIVHVGKTIHRLVTG) and piscidin 3, P3 (FIHHIFRGIVHAGRSIGR-
FLTG), are 22-residue-long, cationic linear peptides, amphipathic and membrane
disruptive isoforms [32]. They exhibit broad range of antibacterial activity, although

https://www.twirpx.org & http://chemistry-chemists.com
10.3 Anticancer Activity
185
their mechanism of action is quite different, P1 has higher antimicrobial activity
than P3, whereas P3 exhibits higher specificity as compared to P1.
For P1, the ATCUN motif is Phe-Phe-His- and for P3 it is Phe-Ile-His and binds
Cu2+ and Ni2+ ions with high affinity through the N-terminal amino group, two
amide nitrogens of the backbone, and the δ-nitrogen of the His-3 [33]. Both P1 and
P3 localize on bacterial cell wall as well as intracellularly on DNA at sub-inhibitory
concentrations. P1 is more hydrophobic and membrane disruptive, whereas P3 is
more neutralizing and condensing to isolated DNA, which led to the hypothesis that
P3 may be targeting DNA rather than membranes to achieve strong potency.
Histatin-5 (Hst-5) (24 residues) and hepcidin (Hpc-25) (25 residue peptides) also
contain the ATCUN motif [34]. Hst-5 is a conformational kinetic peptide, tightly
adsorbed on nickel triacetate resin [35], indicating that the peptide has an affin-
ity for divalent metal ions with obvious copper and zinc sites [36]. Hpc-25 is the
main iron regulator that binds to the main iron transporter in the human body.
Here, the N-terminal is responsible for this interaction, and it also covers ATCUN,
thereby enhancing its antimicrobial ability [37]. CAMPs constitute another interest-
ing template for a new generation of antimicrobial agents, which can quickly kill
Gram-negative and -positive bacteria.
Bacteriocin (also known as bovine dodecapeptide; RLCRIVVIRVCR) is one of
the smallest naturally occurring cationic antimicrobial peptides. Sub5 (a peptide
with five substituents) is a short synthetic AMP derived from a substitution library
of bacteriocin 2 (a linear variant of bacteriocin). After adding the ATCUN motif
to Sub5, the antibacterial activity against various microorganisms was increased
by two to three times, and the minimum inhibitory concentration was in the low
micromolar range.
10.3
Anticancer Activity
The main cause of cancer onset is genome mutation, which leads to the destruc-
tion of basic biological functions, such as cell division, differentiation, angiogenesis,
and relocation. For this changing system in cancer development, multi-target treat-
ment is required. One of the most successful and effective cytotoxic agents against
cancer is cisplatin. However, owing to its chemical instability, poor water solubility,
and low lipophilicity, the clinical application is restricted. Oncologists are currently
using combination therapy, which has shown marginal benefit of common therapy
due to the development of drug resistance or related toxicity. It is estimated that
by 2030, the number of cancer deaths will almost double. Continuous research is
being carried on alleviating the side effects by either coupling them with nanocarri-
ers or by incorporation into micellar system. Some of the complexes of cisplatin with
polymers are under clinical trials [38].
At present, metal surfactant-based complexes have recognized increasing con-
siderations because of their good medicinal value and fewer side effects. The latest
report on a complex having a metal surfactant structure, although not in clinical tri-
als, contains platinum coordinated with the carboxylic acid group of an amphiphilic

polystyrene oligomer (Scheme 10.1) [39]. By calculating the viability of Sk-Br3
cancer cells after cellular uptake of the complex, the efficacy of the oligomer-based
Pt complex was explored. Polymer micelles without cisplatin did not inhibit cell
growth at any concentration. However, as expected, cisplatin-coordinated oligomers
show effective tumor growth inhibition and reduced systemic toxicity in mice. The
efficiency of the metallocomplex is even higher than cisplatin.
The organic–inorganic hybrid, biscetylpyridiniumtetrachloroplatinate (Pt-CPC)
prepared by Sharma and Singh [40], was found to exhibit anticancer activity, which
was comparable to the control drug adriamycin.
10.3.1
Metallosurfactants Effective Against Breast Cancer
The cytotoxic activity of the cobalt complexes prepared by Kumar and Arunachalam
[15, 16] was determined on human breast cancer cells using MTT assay and some
specific staining techniques. It was observed that the cells succumbed to apoptosis
thus reducing the viability of the cells. It is expected that these complexes might
prove beneficial in target-based cancer therapy as the mechanism of cell death
appears to be essentially apoptosis, but necrosis also is one of the desired endpoints
in cancer therapy.
Photochemistry is an elegant tool, which has been into limelight recently
for conversion of non-toxic prodrugs to active cytotoxic species. Light-sensitive
ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes have been recently proposed as prodrugs
for photoactivatable anticancer therapy (PACT), which permits spatial as well as
temporal patterns thus alleviating the toxicity of an anticancer drug [41].

(TTA-UC), which leads to the photoluminescence of Ru—S bond in ruthenium
liposome solution. Up-conversion is done with the help of a PDT (photodynamic
therapy) laser source, which is used clinically (630 nm). It is suggested that this may
provide promising applications in bioimaging and PDT chemotherapy.
Another interesting metal-based amphiphile is a ruthenium-based polypyridyl
complex, which induces cell death via different mechanisms depending on its
concentration [43]. At lower concentration, i.e. below cac, it acts as a monomer and
penetrates the cell membrane, whereas at higher concentration, i.e. above cac, it
forms supramolecular aggregates and induces non-apoptotic cell death. They were
able to permeate the cell membranes and extract lipids and membrane proteins.
Different mechanism of action due to collective behavior above cac was described
as “chemical swarming” analogous to biological swarming of bees. Here the
amphiphilic nature of the metallodrug leads to unexpectedly high and nonselective
cytotoxicity profile against a range of human cancer cell lines. These findings do
issue a word of caution for future designing of metallodrugs. The combination of
charged metal-based head with a lipophilic tail makes self-aggregation feasible,

which should not be overlooked as it changes the concentration of complex that
can penetrate the cell as well as its mode of action (Figure 10.4).
The non-emissive complex [Ru(tpy)(bpy)Cl]Cl complex on coupling to a dodecyl
chain via an amide linker on the 4′ position of the terpyridine yields a new
amphiphilic ruthenium complex [44]. This leads to stabilization of MLCT level,
which is just adequate to switch on red emission. It exhibits self-assembly in
aqueous solution, which is dependent of chloride concentration. The emissive
amphiphilic complex is found to be more cytotoxic than the reference compound
as well as cisplatin. Lipophilic nature of the complex facilitates cellular uptake,
first by insertion into the membrane, and then by migration to the peri-nuclear
region (Figure 10.5). It is possible to modulate such complexes simply by tuning
the functional group attached to the amide like the introduction of cancer-targeting
groups could lead to the development of PACT complexes.
In another study, four metallosurfactants derived from the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ complex
have been prepared having same polar head group but different hydrophobic tails.
In vitro studies showed specificity for the LS180, MCF7, and A549 cell lines [45].
In a similar study by another group, amine-based surfactant–ruthenium(II) com-
plexes with different head groups and variable chain lengths have been synthesized
to understand the strategy of metal drug design [46]. It is observed that the cell

damage caused by these complexes is related to the size of the head group and
the chain length of the alkylamine ligands present in the complex. This further
indicates that the desired biological activity can be achieved by adjusting the head
and tail base of the metal drug.
10.3.2
Metallosurfactants Effective Against Lung Cancer
Metal containing Schiff base amphiphilic complexes also offer promising anti-cancer
properties. Anti-proliferative property of two cobalt(III) Schiff base complexes,
trans-[Co(salen)(DA)2](ClO4)
and
trans-[Co(salophen)(DA)2](ClO4)
(where
salen: N,N′-bis(salicylidene)ethylenediamine, salopen: N,N′-bis(salicylidene)-1,2-
phenylenediamine, DA: dodecylamine) were examined [47]. Both complexes
bind to DNA through insertion and hydrophobic modes, and the latter shows
better binding affinity than the former. Compared with salen complex, it is found
that the salopen-containing complex substantially affects the viability of lung
cancer cells through apoptosis. This result is consistent with earlier studies, which
revealed a correlation between DNA binding and anti-cancer activity [48, 49].
It has been proposed that the synthetic complexes could potentially be used for
cancer chemotherapy and, in general, the inhibition of angiogenesis in lung cancer,
particularly.
Some other surfactant–Co(III) complexes, which act as efficient artificial pro-
teases and bind to DNA, also exhibit high cytotoxicity in cancer cells. Co(III) cyclen
complexes [34] show high cytotoxicity toward A549 lung cancer cells. Here, the
hydrophobic interactions with the proteins rather than micelle formation were
assumed to be responsible for cytotoxic activity. Both cis-[Co(trien)(4CNP)(DA)]3+
(trien = triethylenetetramine, 4CNP = 4-cyanopyridine and DA = dodecylamine)
[50] and cis-[Co(L)2(C11H23NH2)Cl]2+ (L = bpy or phen) [51] bind to nucleic acids.
They act as excellent antitumor agent even at very low concentration, which is due
to the fact that the cobalt complexes increase tumor hypoxia and decrease their
energy status. The extent of cellular damage inflicted by these similar complexes
also depends on the type of axial ligand. The phenanthroline ligand binds more
strongly than the bipyridine ligand and hence exhibits lower IC50 value. This
approach is expected to have potential application in target-based cancer therapy
since the mechanism of cell death appears to be essentially apoptosis. Another
surfactant–Co(III) complex that reflects DNA damage in MCF-7 breast cancer cell
is the one with tetradecylamine chain, cis[Co(trien)(C14H29NH2)Cl](ClO4)2 and
affects their viability at very low concentrations [52]. The mode of cell death is
essentially apoptosis, though necrosis has also been noticed.
10.4
Conclusion and Future Challenges
In an era of increasing resistance to most synthetic drugs, fighting malignancies has
become increasingly difficult. Metallosurfactant-based complexes are alternatives
to the organic drugs and seem to have the potential to fight a variety of pathogens.

10 Metallosurfactants and Their Biological Attributes: Anticancer and Antimicrobial Properties
The amphiphilic character of metallosurfactants is a boon as the hydrophobic
moiety interacts with the lipophilic part of cell membrane or DNA/proteins and
the hydrophilic part having inherent Lewis acidity/redox properties promotes
chemical reactivity. They can be tuned according to the requirement. The results of
in vitro and in vivo studies have shown their therapeutic potential as antibacterial
and antifungal agents. Although many studies have been reported, the precise
mechanism leading to its antimicrobial activity is still not fully understood, and it
may vary depending on the type of microbes. They have been also studied in cancer
prevention approaches and have gained more interest in recent years. Conferring
to numerous works, the metal-surfactant based aggregates have been associated
to a low possibility of cancer growth, promoting their protective role. However,
several studies have revealed that its fundamental interpretation could lead to
confrontation in chemotherapy. Although the exact mechanism is not known, these
characteristics make them excellent applicants for preventive chemotherapy against
tumor stimulation and development. In future, an improved strategy is essential to
review the metallosurfactant-working mechanism in cancer prevention and therapy,
though more studies to initiate the safety profile and efficiency of these substances
will be critical for imminent human trials. The current facts suggest that they are
powerful anticancer agents. Yet, more experiments are needed that illuminate global
toxicity and experimental to decide its clinical benefits. We expect that advances in
technology will yield new tools and approaches to detect and cure diseases.

Why CO?
Possibly, the first question that the title of this chapter suggests to a non-specialized
reader is why it is interesting to study molecules that are capable to release carbon
monoxide (CO), particularly having in mind that CO is a notorious poison.
As it is known, CO is not detected by any of our sensory organs: since it has
no color, no taste, no smell, and it does not irritate the skin nor mucosae; when
inhaled, it stealthily reaches the blood flowing through the pulmonary capillaries.
Here, most of the CO molecules are taken up by the hemoglobin (Hb) contained in
the red blood cells, with an affinity more than 200 times higher than that of oxy-
gen, to form carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), while a few other remain dissolved in the
aqueous phase of the blood (plasma). In such a silent manner, COHb can cause a
dangerous decrease in the supply of O2 to the tissues (hypoxic effect) and this circum-
stance gets worse when, distributed through the body by the blood, the CO reaches
the tissues where it binds to other proteins that contain heme groups (non-hypoxic
effect). If the subject exposed to a high concentration of CO is in an unconscious
state (i.e. sleeping), the early symptoms of poisoning (headache, dizziness, fatigue,
blurred vision, etc.) are not detected and death is usually the fatal end.
There are several natural sources of CO such as volcanic eruptions, bushfires,
and oxidation of methane in troposphere [1, 2]; however, excluding the acute levels
induced by catastrophes, the anthropogenic emissions are those that regularly show
a deeper impact on human beings. The incomplete carbon combustion of fuels in
industry, motor vehicles, etc. can locally increase over 100 times the world average
outdoor CO concentrations, which are about 0.04–0.12 ppm (expressed in volume)
[3]. Regarding anomalous indoor CO peak values, they are usually caused by defec-
tive heating and cooking systems [4, 5] and, for example, an extremely high risk of

death is reached at 500 ppm, a value that causes about 40% of COHb [3]. Every year
this circumstance originates accidental deaths and serious injuries worldwide, but
in this century it has also become an easy method to committing painless suicide
using charcoal [6, 7].
With the previous data it does not seem to be that way, but the relationship of
humans with the artificially produced CO dates long back to before the Industrial
Revolution. For instance, the Greek philosopher Aristotle (384–322 BCE) is usually
mentioned as the first person who wrote about the effect of CO on humans but,
in fact, his observations were slightly vague [8]. In the same way, and although
there is some controversy about the scabrous dead by CO of the Roman Empress
Fausta [9], there are strong evidences of CO intoxication and death of two Byzantine
Emperors [10].
Thus, as can be observed, the participation of CO in human history is absolutely
related with its toxicity. This is precisely what happens with an ancient practice that
is still maintained: smoking. Tobacco smoke contains CO and induces a chronic
hypoxia in heavy smokers because of a permanent increment of blood COHb (till
around five times the normal value). Consequently, in an attempt to compensate the
diminished O2 supply, the body produces more red cells (polycythemia) [11–14], a
phenomenon that increases blood viscosity and demands a higher effort to the heart.
With such a curriculum vitae, it was difficult to believe many decades ago that CO
could have any biomedical application; however, little by little, a series of discov-
eries showed that, like other molecules, its criminal Mr. Hyde personality can be
efficiently modulated to a caring Dr. Jekyll [15].
During the XIX century, some studies were published about the presence of
gases – among them CO – in the blood of animals. This presence was detected not
only due to high external concentrations of the gases, but also in normal conditions
[16–18], and a detailed description of the CO physiological effects was described
by Claude Bernard (1813–1878) in 1857 [19, 20]. Thus, at the beginning of the XX
century, there was an uncertainty about the reason of the existence of CO in the
human blood: was its presence just an environmental consequence or was it related
to the body metabolism? The clear first answer to this question was exposed by
Torgny Sjöstrand (1907–1987) in 1949 [21, 22] and it was rapidly complemented in
the subsequent years by him and other authors [23–25]. These pioneering studies
showed that, surprisingly, our body produces CO endogenously and that it is a
product of the metabolism of the heme group of Hb.
Nowadays we know that the heme group is degraded by an enzyme called heme
oxygenase (HO) (EC 1.14.14.18 in mammalians) and that its catalytic action is by far
the main source of CO produced by the body (other minor sources are, for example,
lipid peroxidation) [26, 27]. As a result, in regular conditions, an overall rate of
0.006 ml of CO per hour and kg of body weight is obtained [3]. At average CO outdoor
concentrations (that is, with no environmental peaks), this production causes less
than 0.5% of COHb in the blood, while the total value in a healthy human is about
0.5–1.7%, due to the inhalation of exogenous CO [3, 28–30]. At first sight, and con-
sidering the vital relevance of the heme group, the existence of a specialized route for
its rapid degradation can look unexpected. However, the free heme group is highly

cytotoxic (as is the case of other porphyrin derivatives), and this is why its intracel-
lular and extracellular regulation is fundamental not only in particular situations,
such as the erythrocyte turnover [31], hemolytic diseases and hemorrhages [32], but
also in normal conditions [33–36]. There are two, or three, isoforms of HO [37–39]:
HO-1, whose expression is induced under different stimuli (as a response to oxida-
tive stress), is found at high levels in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow (where the
senescent erythrocytes are recycled) [31, 37], and rapidly increases its concentration
in other tissues upon transcriptional activation; HO-2, which is continuously syn-
thesized (it is a constitutive enzyme) and is found throughout the body, principally
in testes, brain, liver, kidney, and gut [37, 40]; and, possibly, HO-3 with an uncertain
function [41–44], which is still not clear if it really is a third isoenzyme or if it stems
from HO-2 [32, 45].
Thus, HO has an important role as a cytoprotective agent, which, in mammalians,
is accomplished by (i) the cleavage and oxidation of the heme ring (Figure 11.1)
to give biliverdin, that next is catalyzed to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase (EC
1.3.1.24); (ii) the release of the iron (as Fe2+) that was coordinated in the heme
group; and (iii) the formation of CO. Furthermore, the immediate beneficial func-
tion of HO through the free heme degradation is complemented by the biological
implications of its reaction products: on one hand, bilirubin exhibits a potent
antioxidant activity and it is also implied in immunity processes that, for example,
in mice increase transplantation tolerance for diabetes treatment [46, 47]; and, on
the other hand, the reactive ferrous cation is rapidly removed from the medium by
oxidation to Fe3+ and stored into the iron-carrier protein ferritin for its subsequent
recycling [37, 48, 49]. Taking into account the above, it should not be a surprise that
HO has become a target enzyme for the treatment of several diseases [50–58].
And, what about the CO produced by HO? Is it just a useless and dangerous resid-
ual molecule? The astonishing answer is no. CO can be considered as an example of
the famous (and partially true) statement of Paracelsus (1493–1541) about what is
and what is not a poison: solely the dose determines that a thing is not a poison [59].
The famous Renaissantist physician applied his doctrine to the use of inorganic
mercury preparations as drugs, but today we know that bioaccumulation is possible
and that it can be lethal. This phenomenon explains that the bones of Paracelsus con-
tain about 10 times the normal quantity of mercury, although it is not clear if it was
the cause of death (bones that, by the way, have changed their resting place several

times) [60]. And what about the endogenous CO? In healthy conditions, it does not
accumulate and reaches a non-toxic steady-state concentration in the blood thanks
to lung ventilation. But this is not all: surprisingly, it turns out that it is a signaling
molecule that regulates diverse biological processes. Thus, it can no longer be con-
sidered just as a product of the heme degradation, since, in many occasions, CO is the
desired molecule, the one that will trigger a given effect at a given place [61–63]. This
is the reason why CO is called a gasotransmitter, as it is also the case of NO and H2S,
other endogenously produced gases with signaling activity [64–67] (and perhaps not
the unique) [68, 69]. These three gases – which in the liquid body media are molec-
ularly solubilized – easily cross biological membranes, have specific targets (though
also share some biological effects), and can influence each other [67, 70]. Even
though their complete mechanisms of action are not totally understood, CO activity
is mainly related to its binding capacity to heme-containing proteins (for example
guanylyl cyclase, some ion channels, cytochrome c oxidase), although its interaction
with microbial proteins without heme group has also been reported [71, 72].
Taking all this into account, it is not surprising that CO has a plethora of
potential biomedical applications, either by endogenous production (via HO
activation/expression) and/or by exogenous administration. Thus, for example,
CO shows activity in the cardiovascular system [40, 73–76], has anti-inflammatory
properties [37, 77, 78], participates in stem cell regulation [79], alters the perception
of pain (nociception) [80–84], facilitates transplantation [85–89], contributes to
gastrointestinal protection and healing [90–95], modulates cell metabolism [96, 97],
and induces changes in the circadian rhythm [98, 99], just to say some of the
effects that are described in literature. At this point, it is clear that CO can play
an important role as a drug and, hence, a new question emerges: how can it be
delivered?
11.2
How to Deliver CO?
At first glance, the most straightforward way to supply CO to the body is by taking
advantage of the respiratory system, that is, by inhalation and, in fact, this procedure
is used in some cases. However, this strategy is not as simple as it can seem, since in
clinical trials a precise control of the CO dose in the inhaled air is compulsory, and
COHb concentration in the blood has to be monitored to avoid any poisoning of
the studied subjects. The previous monitorizations can be efficiently accomplished
using current technology, but the CO delivery by inhalation has an inherent
disadvantage: once the gas reaches red blood cells it is transported all through
the body and, consequently, it can affect all the body systems; in other words, a
non-targeted delivery is expected. Yet sometimes this is not a handicap: this is the
case, for example, of works addressed to assess the effect of CO of cigarette smoke
in humans (with inhalations that contain 1200–1500 ppm of CO) [30] and the
evaluation of the effectiveness of CO in the treatment of trauma and hemorrhagic
shock, in pre-clinical trials conducted with mice and pigs [100]. Even in occasions

the systemic distribution of CO has a positive incidence on a given organ, as it
is the case of the preventive and therapeutic action of CO in liver injury in mice
[101], or the suppression of the pathogenesis of experimental cerebral malaria
induced by Plasmodium berghei, also in mice [102]. Nevertheless, the local action
of inhaled CO is not a general rule. This is the reason why low-dose CO inhalations
(100–200 ppm) are common in works intended for the treatment of respiratory
diseases [103]: it is expected that small CO doses will not have a systemic effect (or it
will be minor), but that should be high enough to act on the first organ that the gas
reaches, that is, the lungs. In this way, there are pre-clinical studies that show, for
example, the protective role of inhaled CO (and H2S) on the lungs of mice models
of bronchopulmonary dysplasia [104] (a serious lung disease that mostly affects
premature newborns) and also many clinical trials for the treatment of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease [105], idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [106, 107], and
acute respiratory distress syndrome [108]. But not all are good news. Some authors
have pointed that there is a small correspondence between pre-clinical and clinical
studies [103, 109]; furthermore, though some clinical trials have shown some
positive results, most of them only establish the conditions for a safety low-dose CO
inhalation of patients affected by certain lung diseases. However, this is a required
step to undertake further studies, and we all know that a trustworthy research
needs its time.
There is another approach for CO delivery, which, like inhalation, is related to
one of the biological processes involved in respiration: the use of Hb. In fact, it is
a Hb derivative, where the protein has been linked to polyethylene glycol (PEG)
to avoid extravasation and to maintain several blood properties after transfusion.
Strictly speaking, these systems are designed to increase the blood oxygen-carrying
capacity, though they are administrated with the PEG–Hb saturated with CO
[110, 111]. One of the reasons for that is the protective effect that CO exerts on
the protein by decreasing its autooxidation during storage, but it is not the only
cause. Besides this, it has been shown that the CO released by PEG–Hb after its
transfusion [112] has therapeutic effects related to its known activity on the vascular
system [113, 114].
There are plenty of efforts underway to overcome the intrinsic limitations of the
two previous CO-delivery strategies (inhalation and PEG–Hb) by using artificial sys-
tems. Taking into account the composition/structure of those systems, three differ-
ent approaches can be considered: (i) metal–carbonyl complexes, that is, molecules
that bear CO linked to a transition-metal atom; (ii) alternatively free-metal prodrugs,
which generate CO due to a chemical reaction, and; (iii) inorganic and organic nano-
materials/platforms that can absorb and release CO (and/or other gases) or that carry
CO precursors. In all these three categories, the delivery of the gas can be triggered
by biological factors (pH, proteins, solvent, etc.) or by the use of external stimuli
(temperature, magnetic field, X-ray, ultrasounds, etc.) [72, 115–118]. The first two
methodologies imply the use of individual molecules, which liberate CO, so these
molecules are usually called CO-releasing molecules (CORMs). This term includes

several subfamilies such as ET-CORMs or photo-CORMs, which refer to CORMs
that release the gas triggered by enzymes or light, respectively [119–121].
The pioneering assays with metal–carbonyl complexes were carried out with
simple molecules that, in some cases, have low solubility in aqueous media
(Figure 11.2) [122, 123]. This handicap for their use in biological systems was
rapidly surpassed using molecules with a more complex structure, which confer
them with a hydrophilic character. Subsequently, and in a parallel way to what is
usually done with other drugs, CORMs based on metal complexes were progres-
sively functionalized with the aim of improving their targeting properties [124, 125].
This strategy leads some authors [126] to consider these molecules constituted by
two domains: the coordination sphere, composed of the metal and the CO molecules
as ligand, and the drug sphere, which includes the structure that surrounds the coor-
dination sphere and which determines their pharmacological behavior. However,
although it is a clear and efficient way to conceptualize functionalized CORMs,
it has to be taken into account that the active principle (that is, the molecule that
exhibits therapeutic action) is CO, which is inside the so-called coordination sphere.
There are positive pre-clinical results of the use of derivatized and non-derivatized
metal-carbonyl based CORMs for the treatment of several diseases (including
some that affect the lungs) [127–129], and these molecules are under constant
development [108, 117, 119, 130–132].
One handicap of the metal-based CORMs is that, in some cases and depending
on the dose, they can be toxic. Their toxicity is related with the degradation prod-
ucts generated by the CO release. CORM degradation of heavy metal complexes
can imply processes such as ligand substitution and/or oxidation of the metal atom
as is the case, for example, of molybdenum–carbonyl CORMs [72, 115]. However,
no general statements can be given and data on human toxicity of molybdenum
are limited and with inconsistent findings. Molybdenum nanoparticles are increas-
ingly used in food, industry, and medicine [133], but despite this fact, few toxicology

studies are available and it is said to be one of the least toxic metals upon applica-
tion [134–136]. Their toxic effects (which are dose-dependent, species-specific, and
modulated by the particle size) include reactive oxygen species-induced oxidative
stress [137], mitochondrial dysfunction [138, 139], membrane integrity disruption
[137, 140–142], and DNA damage [138, 143, 144]. In contrast to the above-mentioned
studies, there are some others indicating a low and negligible cytotoxicity of molyb-
denum nanoforms and the possibilities for their use as therapeutic tools [145–149].
As regards the free-metal prodrugs (the second type of artificial systems with
CO-releasing capacity), one of their main advantages is the absence of metal
transition atoms in their structure, which makes them an interesting alternative
to metal–carbonyl CORMs. Most of them are organic molecules that contain a
carbonyl group (as carboxylic acid, borocarbonate, borocarbonate ester, borocar-
bamate, ketone, etc.) that generates CO under certain stimuli or by inter- and
intramolecular Diels–Alder reaction [150–152]. This strategy, however, implies a
smaller CO-releasing capacity than that of the metal-based CORMs, which usually
bear several CO ligands that are able to be released. On the other hand, studies on
methylene chloride, a free-metal prodrug with no carbonyl group, showed that it
induces the formation of CO when metabolized by mixed-function oxidases in the
liver [153, 154], but its toxic doses (oral and inhaled) [155] and its suspected car-
cinogenesis probably have hampered its use. In any case, there are pre-clinical trials
that show the effectiveness of carbonyl-bearing pro-drug CORMs. This is the case of
in vitro and in vivo studies with specific CORMs that have two endogenous triggers
(enzyme and pH) and which protect the liver in induced systemic inflammation
[156], and that of a family of photo-CORMs, which exhibit anti-inflammatory
effects in cell cultures [157].
The last category of systems able to transport and deliver exogenous CO, that
is, the inorganic and organic nanomaterials/platforms, comprises a great variety of
designs. Some are based in the gas adsorption capacity of porous materials [158], like
water-dispersible metal–organic frameworks that form microcrystals, which carry
CO and that release the gas due to their biodegradability [159]. The use of different
type of porous materials is not restricted to gas adsorption, since CORMs can also be
incorporated into these structures without the formation of covalent bonds, due to
electrostatic or intermolecular forces (such as hydrogen bonds) [160]. This feature
is also the keystone of the entrapment of CORMs into lipid solid nanoparticles [161]
and in micelles, where the CO donor, which has poor water solubility, forms the
hydrophobic core [162]. Alternatively, in occasions, the strategy is based in the for-
mation of covalent bonds between the carrier platform and the CORMs. Examples
of that are, among others, a polymer–protein system that bounds CORM-3 via the
protein histidine residues [163], micelle-forming block copolymers, which include
a metal-based CORM in the chain [164, 165] and metallodendrimers [166]. Thus,
there is a long list of CO-releasing platforms composed of a huge diversity of mate-
rials [116, 124, 160, 167, 168], a characteristic that makes possible their functional-
ization to improve their local CO delivery. As for the case of CORMs (metal-based
or metal-free prodrugs), some of the previous nanomaterials have shown positive
biological effects in pre-clinical studies [160–162].

11 Metallosurfactants as Carbon Monoxide-Releasing Molecules
11.3
CO-releasing Metallosurfactants
From a conceptual point of view, a metallosurfactant with CO-releasing capacity
has a clear design: a transition metal bonded to some CO ligands and to one or
more structures that confer an amphipathic character to the molecule. Usually, these
structures are hydrocarbon chains that can bear a polar group.
Additionally, the CO ligands must be prone to be released under certain stimuli
(acidic or basic pH, temperature, light, enzymes, and/or oxidizing agents), as the
previously described CORMs do. With this general design in mind, two particular
arrangements are possible: that with the metal embedded into the polar head
of the metallosurfactant and the opposite, that is, with the metal located in the
hydrophobic domain of the molecule and a polar group (Figure 11.3). As regards
the hydrophilic chain, the quantity, length, and saturation grade are important
parameters that alongside the volume of the polar head modulates – via the packing
factor – the type of the aggregated system that a given surfactant forms [169–171].
This feature is the first difference among most of the regular CORMs and a met-
allosurfactant CORM (MTS-CORM): due to their intrinsic structure MTS-CORMs
are dispersible in aqueous media and give supramolecular aggregates (with no
water-solubility problems). It is true that there are a few other CORM systems
that form micelles, as it is the case of block copolymers that bear a metal-based
CORM [164, 165]. However, there is a substantial difference: these block copolymer
chains have molecular weights comprised between 17.000–35.000 Da, while the
maximum values for MTS–CORMs are about 1.000 Da, similar to that of the biolog-
ical membrane-forming phospholipids (about 700–1000 Da). This situation allows
MTS–CORMs not only to aggregate when used on their own (usually as micelles if
they have one hydrocarbon chain and as vesicles if they have two) [172] but also
when mixed with phospholipids, a versatility that allows them to form different
type of CO-releasing aggregates (CORAs). For example, the MTS-photo-CORM
obtained by Sakla and Jose [173] is a molecule with the polar head constituted
by a manganese carbonyl complex and an octadecanoyl chain as hydrophobic

domain. This inverted cone-shaped MTS (whose packing factor corresponds to
a micelle-forming molecule) is efficiently incorporated into liposomes (vesicles)
constituted by phospholipid bilayers.
At this point, we have to mention that these vesicular systems (either formed by
MTS or MTS/phospholipid mixtures) that contain metal atoms are sometimes called
metallosomes. However, this term encompasses a broad spectrum of possibilities.
As far as we know, the pioneering paper using this word was published in 1999 by
Hainfeld et al., and it was used to describe liposomes that contained some phospho-
lipids covalently attached to gold nanoclusters of 0.8 and 1.4 nm [174]. Thus, in this
case, metallosomes describes liposomes that carry groups of metal atoms out of their
membrane. This conception of the term fits partially in other works, in which a metal
atom is integrated into the surfactant structure (the polar head), which, in turn, is a
constitutive part of a vesicle [175–179]. Even more distant to the original use of the
word metallosome is the case of vesicular structures obtained by self-assembly of an
anticancer molecule and a block copolymer [180]. As can be observed, in spite of the
diversity of usages, the most general use of the term metallosome applies to vesicles
(with or without phospholipids) that bear molecules that contain a metal atom.
In general, the presence of phospholipids provides some advantages to MTS
supramolecular aggregates. Their presence in natural membranes makes phos-
pholipid liposomes a non-toxic drug-delivery system, a role that was glimpsed in
1960s by Alec Bangham, who is considered the father of liposomes [181, 182]. Since
then, liposomes that entrap drugs into their bilayers and/or in their inner aqueous
medium have been studied and used in drug delivery [183–188] by different routes
of administration (oral, topical, parenteral, nasal) [189–192]. These mixed vesicles
can be obtained by several methods of preparation (even at industrial scale), which
controls their physicochemical characteristics [193–195], can be derivatized (as a
targeting strategy) [196–198] and are stable to dilution, a characteristic not always
held by aggregates constituted by other surfactants. Even gas-filled liposomes
have been described, but they are proposed to imaging applications and do not
contain CO [199, 200]. Given this context, the previously described [173] mixed
photo-CORAs, which contain the metallosurfactant with the Mn complex in the
polar head, are a suitable system for a controlled CO delivery.
However, as it has been previously stated, another approach is possible con-
sidering the general structure of MTS–CORMs: a molecule with the metal atom
in the non-polar domain. This is the case of molybdenum carbonylic metallo-
surfactants because of the high hydrophobic character of the Mo—CO bond.
These molybdenum-based CORMs (Mo–CORMs) with one or two hydrocarbon
chains with a negative group (sulfonate) at the opposite part of the chain, create
supramolecular aggregates on their own [201, 202] and also when mixed with phos-
pholipids [203, 204]. The type of structures they form can be regulated by means of
the Mo-CORM to phospholipid molar ratio and, like liposomes, can be derivatized;
furthermore, the sulfonate group of Mo-CORMs allows to incorporate polymers
with amino groups due to the strong interaction between both groups [205].

11 Metallosurfactants as Carbon Monoxide-Releasing Molecules
11.3.1
Synthesis of Molybdenum-Based CORMs
The first step to obtain molybdenum carbonylic CORMs is the synthesis of the
ligands, a family of functionalized phosphines with a hydrophobic region and a
polar head group that exhibit self-aggregation properties [206]. Both regions will
contribute to the desired aggregation properties in aqueous media of the final
compounds when coordinated to a metallic center of molybdenum with carbonyl
groups. The ligands consist of diphenylphosphines with the third position of the
phosphorous atom coordinated to a hydrocarbon chain with a sulfonate group at
the end. By modifying the length of the hydrocarbon chain, different aggregation
properties are obtained.
The synthesis of the family of ligands, with structure Ph2P(CH2)nSO3Na where
n = 2, 6, and 10, is carried out in two steps. For the shorter ligands (L2 (n = 2) and L6
(n = 6)), the first step allows to obtain a halosulfonated compound (Figure 11.4a).
Starting with a commercial precursor, the dihalogenated hydrocarbon compound
(Br(CH2)nCl), a nucleophilic substitution is carried out and one halogen group is
changed by a sulfonate group using sodium sulfite (Na2SO3). The two halogens of
the initial compound are different to avoid the formation of the disulfonate product.
In the case of L10 (n = 10), it is difficult to find this kind of dihalogenated compound,

so the precursor is Cl(CH2)10Cl and extra considerations must be taken to minimize
the formation of the disulfonate compound.
The second step allows the introduction of the coordinating diphenylphosphino
group to the molecule. It consists of another nucleophilic substitution in which the
halogen group is changed by a diphenylphosphine group by means of a reaction in
ammoniacal medium. Once these ligands are synthesized and purified, they can be
used to obtain two families of metallosurfactants: a family with a metallic center and
two ligands coordinated, that is, tetracarbonylic (TCO) compounds [Mo(CO)4(Ln)2];
and a second family of compounds with only one ligand coordinated, the pentacar-
bonylic (PCO) compounds [Mo(CO)5Ln]. The synthetic path is different for the two
groups of compounds.
The synthesis of molybdenum TCO metallosurfactants (Figure 11.4b) is the
same regardless of the length of the chain and consists of a substitution reaction
of the two labile piperidine molecules in the compound cis-[Mo(CO)4(pip)2] by
the respective phosphine ligand Ph2P(CH2)nSO3Na to lead to the TCO compounds
cis-[Mo(CO)4(Ln)2].
Regarding pentacarbonyl derivatives (Figure 11.4b), different synthetic proce-
dures have been reported for their preparation and many of them require high
temperatures and long reaction times [207–209]. This approach is possible for
the preparation of PCO metallosurfactants [201], but one interesting alternative
is the use of trimethylamine oxide dihydrate (Me3NO ⋅2H2O) to oxidate one
of the carbonyl groups of [Mo(CO)6] to CO2 leading to the formation of the
complex [Mo(CO)5(CH3CN)] [202]. Next, an exchange reaction is carried out
between the labile acetonitrile ligand linked to molybdenum by the phosphine
ligand Ph2P(CH2)nSO3Na, resulting in the formation of the desired compound,
[Mo(CO)5Ln].
11.3.2
Properties of Mixed CORAs Constituted by Molybdenum-Based
Metallosurfactants and Phospholipids
The molybdenum-based MTSs described in 11.3.1 are photo-CORMs and exhibit
self-aggregation properties in aqueous medium [201, 202]. However, these aggre-
gates are not stable to dilution, an important property for delivery systems intended
for human applications. This is the reason why these Mo-CORMs were mixed with
phosphatidylcholine (PC), a natural phospholipid that forms stable bilayers, which
can hold other type of molecules. The suspensions were obtained after hydrating
and vortexing a thin film of both substances (prepared by rotary evaporation of a
CHCl3/methanol solution), which lead to the formation of spontaneous structures
at room temperature. The characteristics of these supramolecular systems depend
not only on the type of Mo-CORM used, but also on the Mo-CORM to PC ratio (cen-
tral scheme in Figure 11.5). An example is shown in Figure 11.5a for the case of the
tetracarbonyl Mo-CORM with two alkyl chains with 6 carbon atoms each (TCOL6).
As can be observed, the size of the aggregates analyzed by dynamic light scatter-
ing decreases progressively from 0 to 4 mM concentration of TCOL6 (at a constant
PC concentration of 3 mM). At low TCL6 values, the aggregates are mostly large

vesicles, as it was detected by cryo-TEM, while at 3–4 mM of TCOL6 small micelles
are formed (see upper pictures). Surprisingly, the system shows a sharp discontinu-
ity at a TCOL6 concentration equal or higher than 6 mM and a very different type of
CORA is obtained: they are large rods that can be observed by optical microscopy.
The different type of CORAs that the binary mixtures produce are summarized
in Figure 11.5b: vesicles (metallosomes), micelles, bicelles (bilayer fragments), and
rods are obtained. The transition from one to another structure can be sharp (con-
tinuous horizontal lines) or progressive (coarse faded horizontal lines), and all the
systems were stable to dilution except PCOL6 vesicles (indicated with an asterisk)
obtained at a Mo-CORM concentration higher than, approximately, 8 mM.
The CO-releasing properties of the molecules upon illumination (with visible or
ultraviolet light) were conserved in the aggregates as detected by Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) by measuring the decrease of the CO bands of
the Mo-CORMs. It can be observed in Figure 11.5c for the case of PCOL10/PC
30 : 10 mM/mM vesicles, where the main vibrational bands of the Mo-CORM
(at 2070 and 1940 cm−1) decrease upon the illumination (λ = 365 nm) time, while the
CO ester band of PC is not altered. FTIR spectroscopy coupled to a microscope and
synchrotron light (micro-FTIR) allowed to detect the interaction of the Mo-CORMs
with fibroblasts after their incubation with different CORAs. An example is shown
in the inset of Figure 11.5c for the case of TCOL2/PC 1 : 3 mM/mM metallosomes
after 12 hours of cell incubation. The cell spectrum shows the characteristic CO band
of the Mo-CORM located at 1900 cm−1 and the intense protein band of the cell at
about 1650 cm−1, and it is worth noting that the intensity of the interaction depends
on the type of CORA used [204]. This is also the case for the Mo-CORM toxicity
in cell cultures, since it is strongly modulated by the type of aggregate used for the
incubations, as shown in Figure 11.5d for TCOL2/PC CORAs. Free Mo-CORM and
micellar systems are highly toxic, but TCOL2/PC metallosomes exhibit the same
behavior than pure PC liposomes in the studied range, that is, no toxicity.
The previously mentioned in vitro characterization of the CORA systems consti-
tuted by molybdenum-based metallosurfactants and phospholipids is just a first step
in their study, but it allows to start thinking in their potential clinical translations.
To do that, new problems have to be faced as, for example, an accurate control of
the size of the metallosomes, in vivo long-term circulation or site-specific targeted
delivery. The corresponding solutions can be enlightened by the long experience
accumulated in the liposome field. Thus, future works may consider, for example,
vesicle size control by extrusion or microfluidics, the incorporation of other lipids
(such as cholesterol) to regulate membrane properties (i.e. permeability, resistance
to bile salts) and the inclusion of derivatized phospholipids into the CORAs. The last
approach should result, for example, in an increase of their in vivo circulation time if
PEG-phospholipids are used, or in a local delivery if these added phospholipids are
derivatized, by instance, with a molecule that binds to a target cellular receptor.

11 Metallosurfactants as Carbon Monoxide-Releasing Molecules
11.4
Conclusions
The relatively new finding that CO is involved in several endogenous (and non-toxic)
biological processes as gasotransmitter has spurred the research on its use as drug
intended, for example, for the treatment of cardiovalscular diseases, pain regula-
tion, or organ transplantation. The inherent difficulties for its administration are
being overcome by the use of molecules that bear bonded CO and that release the
gas under the action of biological or external stimuli. In this way, there are a lot of
possible candidates that can become a useful CORM/system. One of these actors are
metallosurfactants that, for the moment, exhibit two general structures attending to
the location of the metal atom (and the CO groups) into the molecule, that is, in the
polar domain in the hydrophobic region. Rational design of metallosurfactant (for
example, by the number and length of hydrocarbon chains, charges groups, etc.)
modulates their characteristics and allows obtaining different aggregated systems
with CO-releasing properties. This approach shows some specificities in compari-
son with the use of other CORMs. For example: metallosurfactants constitute their
own drug-delivery system by self-aggregation as micelles, vesicles, or other aggre-
gated systems; they also form several types of mixed systems with phospholipids;
and these mixed systems can be modified by the inclusion of other molecules to
adjust their in vivo behavior. Thus, CO-releasing metallosurfactants have enough
merits to be considered as promising molecules, but there is still a long way to go
and lots of efforts and creativity (and research funding) are necessary to finally get a
commercial drug.

Introduction
Recently, significant progress has been achieved in the development of drug delivery
systems, which makes it possible to increase the safety and efficacy of pharma-
ceutics, minimize side effects, and improve the quality of treatment of dangerous
diseases [1–3]. For these purposes, different families of nanocarriers have been
fabricated, including soft supramolecular nanocontainers [4, 5], macrocyclic [6, 7],
and hybrid nanostructured materials [8, 9]. Self-assembling supramolecular systems
attract special attention due to their tunable morphology and gradient of properties
in nanoscale dimension, which provide the tool for multifactor control of the bind-
ing/release behavior of encapsulated guests. Beneficial features of nanocontainers
based on amphiphilic compounds are their biocompatibility, membrane tropic
properties, low toxicity, and binding ability toward both hydrophilic and lipophilic
drugs [4, 5]. Importantly, these self-assembling nanocontainers are capable of
noncovalent modification that provides simple and versatile way for the fabrication
of novel generations of nanocarriers with improved characteristics. Thus, noncova-
lent strategy involving cationic surfactants was used to engineer the nanocarriers
with targeted properties [10], antimicrobial activity [11], vehicles for gene delivery
[12, 13], and the nanoformulations capable to overcome the blood–brain barrier
[14]. Hybrid nanoplatforms, especially metal-modified nanomaterials [8, 9, 15], are
employed to enlarge potential of their practical applications due to fine tailoring
the structural characteristics of nanocontainers and involving additional interac-
tions with both guest molecules and bioenvironment, thereby, improving loading
capacity, targeting properties, selectivity, and therapeutic activity. Noteworthy, the

hybrid nanocontainers in the fields of diagnostics, catalysis, protective coating,
imaging, etc. These issues are addressed in the chapter.
12.2
Structure, Properties, and Biomedical Application
of Metallosurfactants
Metal-containing surfactants ensure their visibility through the expanded range of
applications. This is caused by the presence of not only the properties of ordinary
surfactants, among which - the spatially oriented adsorption at the phase boundary,
the ability to self-assemble with the formation of supramolecular structures of differ-
ent morphology, and the solubilization of poorly soluble substances are of particular
importance. One of the most unique properties of metallosurfactant is of course their
enhanced redox activity and magnetic properties [16].
The transition metals, such as copper [17], nickel [18], cobalt [19–21], zinc [22],
iron [23], and lanthanides [23], are usually used as a metal part of metallosurfac-
tants. The hydrophobically modified nitrogen-, oxygen- (capable of acting as electron
donors to metals), sulfur-, phosphorus-containing compounds of linear (amines,
amides, amine acetates, sulfates) [24, 25] and cyclic (pyridine-, imidazole-, triazole-,
phenanthroline-based surfactants) [26] structures are used as ligands (Table 12.1).
Moreover, the variation of metallosurfactant structure is carried out according to the
number of amphiphilic ligands at the metal atom [32], the number of long-chain sub-
stituents in ligands [20], and the length of hydrophobic chains [33]. An important
feature of metallosurfactants is also the location of the metal in the complex. The
metal may be a part of the head group [26], the hydrophobic part of surfactant [28],
or act as a counterion of various structures [29] (Table 12.1).
Depending on the synthesis conditions, metallosurfactants can be divided into
three types. The synthesis of metallosurfactants of the first type is carried out either
by one- (Scheme 12.1) [34] or two-step (Scheme 12.2) [21] procedures and, as a
rule, in organic solvents. Molybdenum carbonyl metallosurfactants [Mo(CO)5L]
(L = Ph2P(CH2)nSO3Na, n = 2, 6, 10) of the second type were synthesized in
methanol/THF from Mo(CO)6 through the intermediate [Mo(CO)5(CH3CN)]
by decarboxylation with Me3NO and subsequent reaction with functionalized
phosphine. Metallosurfactant [Mo(CO)4L2] of the same type was obtained via the
intermediate [Mo(CO)4(pip)2] complex and its subsequent reaction with a ligand
[28]. The synthesis of complexes of the third type can proceed in one (by mixing the
ligand and the corresponding salt [29]) or two stages (Scheme 12.3) [16] in ethanol
[16, 29], water [30, 31], or dichloromethane [23].
Many morphological structures formed in the metallosurfactant-based systems
have been discussed including the aggregates of micellar [19], vesicular [34], lipo-
somal (metallosomes) [35], and lamellar structures [30]. Metal complexes can be
part of microemulsions [36], form Langmuir–Blodgett films [37], and also act as
a hybrid additive to highly porous silicon-based materials [17]. The possibility of
the transition of morphological structures into each other is also noted. Using the

cryo-transmission electron microscopy (TEM) method, the authors of [38] showed
that metallomicelles can coexist with vesicles or easily transform into them. Such
transitions are possible due to the concentration change of the metal complex in
solution [38], as well as the presence of a metal center in the metallosurfactant. The
latter is discussed in the review by Owen and Butler [39], where the authors describe
the surface-active ligands that undergo a change in morphology due to coordina-
tion of metal ion (coordination-induced micelle-to-vesicle transition). Amphiphilic
siderophores were produced by bacteria and different synthetic amphiphilic ligands
(carboxylate surfactants, octadecylamine, imidazolium surfactants, 2,2′-bipyridine
surfactants). The mechanism of the metal-induced phase transition was considered
in terms of coordination chemistry, nature of ligands, and changes in the molecular
geometry as a result of metal coordination.
The conventional functional properties of metallosurfactants are their ability
to aggregate in solutions and solubilize important but poorly soluble substances
(dyes, drugs) in the micellar phase. This determines the possibility of their use
as extractants, nanocarriers, and catalysts. The aggregation parameters (critical
micelle concentration [CMC], aggregation number, and micelle shape) substantially
depend on the basic structural units of metallosurfactants (head group, metal, and
length of hydrocarbon tail) [40]. Herewith, there is a classical decrease of CMC with
an increase in the length of the hydrocarbon tail and a non-classical increase of CMC
with an increase in the number of methylene units in the cycle of the ligand head
group. The latter may be caused by a higher charge on the head group, a steric factor
on the micellar surface, and a reduced shielding of the hydrophobic micelle core [40].
The influence of metal in a surfactant molecule and its nature on micelle-forming
properties also has its own peculiarities. The introduction of a metal cation can either
increase the CMC of the azo-macrocyclic ligand containing Tb(III), Yb(III), and
Y(III) [40] or have the opposite beneficial effect in the case of Cu(II)-, Co(II)-, Ni(II)-,
and La(III)-containing monoalkylated 1-hexadecyl-1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octanes
(D-16) [27, 32]. The Krafft temperature also depends on the chemical structure of
metallosurfactant and the nature of metal included in its composition [41].

12.3 Amphiphilic System Based on Metallosurfactants and Macrocycles

Mukherjee et al. studied the thermodynamics of micelle formation of complexes
between alkyltrimethylammonium bromides (ATABs), sodium molybdate, and
sodium tungstate [42]. The standard free energy of micellization value (ΔG
∘
m) of
both metallosurfactants was close, but higher than their precursor surfactants,
ATABs, in absolute value, i.e. the micelle formation of the metallosurfactants was
more spontaneous. An increase in the hydrophobicity of the complexes also favored
the formation of aggregates. The values of the standard entropy change of micelle
formation (ΔS
∘
m) for all metallosurfactants were positive, significant in magnitude,
and higher than ΔS
∘
m of the corresponding ATABs. The much smaller values of
absolute enthalpy of micellization (ΔH
∘
m) of complexes, compared with ΔG
∘
m,
indicate that the process is entropy controlled.
Zhiltsova, Ibatullina, et al. studied the solubilizing effect of D-n-based met-
allosurfactant (n = 14–18) with respect to the water-insoluble dye Orange OT
[27, 32] and poorly soluble drugs with a broad spectrum of activities (quercetin
[43], nitrofurantoin [44], griseofulvin [45]) and identified the dependence of their
functional properties on the nature of metal. D-16 in a complex with copper(II)
and lanthanum(III) ions has an increased solubilizing ability. The solubilization
capacity of these complexes is up to 2.5 times greater than the capacity of D-16 and
significantly higher (up to 6.5 times) than the capacity of cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide [32]. The high solubilization ability of metallomicellar systems was also
observed toward the drugs used. The increase in the solubility of quercetin reaches
270 times, and the solubility of griseofulvin increases by 1 order of magnitude
[43, 44]. It is also known that the metal complexes exhibit good antimicro-
bial (antibacterial, antifungal) and anticancer activities [46]. At the same time,
D-16-based metallosurfactants simultaneously exhibit antibacterial and antifungal
activities, which are higher than those of the test compounds in a number of
strains [47, 48].
An important feature of metallosurfactants expanding the field of biomedical
applications, is also their ability to form complexes with biomolecules. The latter
can be proteins (bovine serum albumin, BSA) [29], nucleic acid (DNA) [49–51],
or its decamer (oligonucleotide) [27]. From a biomedical point of view, apart
from being used as biologically active substances with antimicrobial, antifungal,
anticancer activities [20, 47, 48, 50, 51], metallosurfactants are also utilized as
nanocontainers for useful substances (including drugs and genetic material) in
targeted delivery. Gd3+, 64Cu2+, 111In3+-containing metallosurfactants in micellar,
polymer–colloidal, or multifunctional liposomal systems can be used for diagnostic
purposes in magnetic resonance, optical, and single-photon emission tomography
[52]. All this testifies to the high application potentials of metallosurfactants and
the prospects for the development of research in the field of biology and medicine.

a macrocycle can result in local conformational changes that adapt easily to the
geometric requirements of metal cations. The interaction between macrocycles and
metals provides not only high values of the binding constants, but can also initiate
the aggregation of macrocycles without alkyl tails.

Tashiro et al. described the cation-induced aggregation of hexaaza-cyclophanes
without long-chain alkyl groups [53]. The coordination between Pd2+ and macrocy-
cle initiates the formation of submicrospherical aggregates upon complexation with
macrocyclic ligands consisting of three phenylenediamine and p-phenylene frag-
ments. The formed trinuclear palladium complexes are considered as amphiphiles,
consisting of three hydrophilic Pd2+–o-phenylenediamine fragments and six
hydrophobic phenylene moieties. These complexes are stable in weak acid medium,
while they are slowly colored in basic or neutral aqueous solutions probably due to
the oxidation of Pd2+–o-phenylenediamine fragments as a result of deprotonation
of N–H groups. Nevertheless, for greater stability, the complexation of metal is
more favorable with an alkylated macrocycle than with non-alkylated one. The
amphiphilic platinum–acetylide metallocycle 1 with clearly defined shape and size
was obtained in ref. [54]. The obtained metallocycle based on platinum acetylide
proved to be stable to air and humidity at room temperature. The study of its
supramolecular aggregation showed that the hydrophobic interaction between
alkyl chains and the hydrogen bond between amides are the driving forces for the
formation of ordered aggregates.
Lebrón J.A. et al. synthesized two Ru(II)-based metallosurfactants bearing three
2,2′-bipyridine ligands, one of which was alkylated with an undecyl residue and

methyl group 2b, and the other with two undecyl groups 2a [55]. It was shown
the formation of micellar aggregates between the cationic head groups of the met-
allosurfactant and the anionic phosphate residues of the polynucleotide results in
condensation of the polynucleotide at a certain concentration of metallosurfactants.
In ref. [56], natural cyclodextrins (CDs) interact with both investigated metallosur-
factants 2a, 2c forming inclusion complexes, where the undecyl surfactant tails enter
the macrocycle cavity. The addition of macrocyclic molecules [55] complicates the
self-assembly of metallosurfactants, therefore, preventing the interaction of metal-
losurfactant with polynucleotide.
The study on mixed systems between metallosurfactants and macrocycle, par-
ticularly α-CD, is presented in ref. [57]. At the first stage, the dynamic metallo-
supramolecular amphiphiles were obtained in aqueous solution by the interaction of
cationic Pt(II) complex of 2,6-bis(N-triethyleneglycolbenzimidazol-2-yl)-pyridine 3
with anionic surfactants sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS), and sodium dodecanoate
(SD). Using spectrophotometric, spectrofluorimetric, and dynamic light scattering
(DLS) methods, it was found that the addition of SDS and SD into the aqueous solu-
tions of cationic Pt(II) complex leads to the formation of ordered aggregates with the
diameters of 307 and 246 nm, respectively.

TEM image proved the formation of rod-like aggregates for SDS-cationic Pt(II)
complex and sheet-like aggregates for SD-cationic Pt(II) complex that was explained
by the larger hydrophobic size of SD-Pt(II) complex in comparison with SDS-Pt(II)
complex. The driving forces of aggregation were the electrostatic, hydrophobic,
Pt/Pt, and π–π stacking interactions. At the second stage of the work, the obtained
aggregates were titrated with α-CD. As the inclusion complexes with α-CD were
formed, the hydrophobic interactions of metallosupramolecular amphiphiles
destroyed and the aggregates of SDS and SD with cationic Pt(II) complex dissociated
into small particles of 3.2 and 1.4 nm, respectively. Moreover, during the host–guest
recognition of α-CD, the signals of the metal–metal-to-ligand-charge transfer
(MMLCT) absorption and 3MMLCT emission bands returned back to the original
levels, which made it possible to regulate the photophysical properties of the system.

12 Supramolecular Metal-Modiﬁed Nanocontainers Based on Amphiphilic and Hybrid Matrix
Another study on joint aggregation between metallosurfactant and CD is
described by Iza et al. [58]. Using a set of physico-chemical methods, the aggrega-
tion properties of chiral metallosurfactant bis(2,2′-bipyridine)(4,4′-ditridecyl-2,2′-
bipyridine)ruthenium(II) dichloride 2d were investigated. Initially, the formation
of metallosurfactant aggregates was detected by UV–vis and fluorescence spec-
troscopies. Then, to determine the shape, the internal structure, and the size of
aggregates, the neutron-scattering curves were recorded and DLS experiments
were performed. The obtained data indicated the prolate ellipsoid structure of
the micelles with the aggregation number of 14. As in ref. [57], the addition of
CDs (β-CD and γ-CD) lead to the destruction of micelles due to complexation
of macrocycle with metallosurfactant. The formation of inclusion complexes
was also confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy on the basis of chemical shifts of
protons in macrocycle. The stoichiometry of the complexes was determined by Job’s
method. The spatial structure of the metallosurfactant with two long tails favors the
formation of complexes with β-CD and γ-CD in 1 : 3 stoichiometry, where one CD
molecule gets through one of the alkyl tails and two CD molecules get through the
other tail, close to the polar head group. Finally, it was shown that the complex with
β-CD was about 2 orders of magnitude more stable than the complex with γ-CD.
Some amphiphilic metal complexes of synthetic macrocycles attract special
attention of researchers as prototypes of active centers in metalloproteins that
perform catalytic functions in biological systems. For example, the different
micellar and vesicular aggregates based on complexes of octadecanoyl derivative
of cyclen with zinc 4a, 4b, 5a, 5b, 5c can be used to accelerate DNA cleavage [59].
In addition, zinc complexes of cyclen with long-chain substituents 4c, 4d were
also investigated in the cleavage of p-nitrophenylphosphate in a micellar solution
with Triton X-100 [60]. The authors of ref. [61] reported an increase in the cleavage
activity of BSA and myoglobin by amphiphilic complexes of cyclen with Cu(II)
and Co(III) 6a–6f due to hydrophobic interactions with cleaved proteins, and the
cleavage activity increases with increasing chain length. The alkyl chain of these
metal complexes is a kind of “anchor” on the hydrophobic domain of proteins,
which allows the macrocyclic head to be located next to the peptide bond to be
hydrolyzed. On the other hand, in the structure of enzymatic model not only
the active center, but also the microenvironment around is considered. Micelles
are often used to simulate the microenvironment of enzymes due to the similar
identity of the structures of micelles and globular proteins, as well as the similarity
of the substrate-binding ability of micelles and enzymes. Based on the foregoing,
complexes of aza-macrocyclic compound bearing carboxyl group with lanthanides
(lanthanum 7a and cerium 7b) can be used as a center of catalytic activity, and
a metallomicellar system consisting of lanthanide(III) complex and micelles of
zwitterionic surfactant, n-lauroylsarcosine, was developed as a mimetic phosphate
hydrolase model for the hydrolytic cleavage of bis(4-nitrophenyl)phosphate [62].
The rate of phosphate hydrolysis, catalyzed by a macrocyclic complex in a metal-
lomicellar system, is approximately 50 times higher than in an aqueous solution
under the same conditions. In a weakly alkaline medium, lauroylsarcosine is in the

form of an anion; therefore, the complex easily dissolves in the Stern layer of the
surfactant micelles due to electrostatic attraction between the positively charged
complex and the anionic micelle. The latter increases the local concentration and
the frequency of collisions of reaction molecules due to the solubilizing effect of
micelles and thus promotes the catalytic hydrolysis of phosphate.

12 Supramolecular Metal-Modiﬁed Nanocontainers Based on Amphiphilic and Hybrid Matrix
The chemical modification of macrocyclic ligands by functionalization with
alkyl substituents makes it possible to obtain active amphiphilic functional objects
compatible with lipid matrices of colloidal carriers [63]. As noted above, using
the reaction of hydrolysis of a model compound, bis-p-(nitrophenyl)phosphate,
the catalytic activity of synthetic amphiphilic receptor (alkylated bis-cyclic zinc
complex 4a) in micellar and vesicular solutions was investigated [59]. The course
of the reaction was monitored by an increase in the absorption intensity of
one of the hydrolysis products, nitrophenolate, in the region of 400 nm. It was
shown that the catalytic activity of the complex increases significantly even in
a micellar solution as compared to a molecular solution of non-alkylated ana-
log. The highest efficiency of catalytic hydrolysis with the participation of an
amphiphilic macrocyclic metal complex was achieved in a vesicular system based
on 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. In continuation of the above work,
the mixed Langmuir monolayers of this lipid and the amphiphilic receptor 5a were
obtained [64]. Immobilization of the receptor in the lipid matrix leads to an increase
in the rate of decomposition of bis-(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate in the monolayer by
almost an order of magnitude.
There are few works devoted to investigation of mixed assemblies between met-
allosurfactant and macrocycles. Roldán-Carmona et al. in ref. [65] described the
formation of iridium metallosurfactant–porphyrin film. The latter was formed by
Langmuir–Schaefer technique, which allowed authors to combine two luminescent
species, amphiphilic monocationic Ir(III) metallosurfactant 8a and tetraanionic por-
phyrin 8b, together. Using macrocycle molecules as counterions with the ratio, when
the monolayer is neutral, promotes homogeneity and distribution of metallosurfac-
tant molecules along the air–water interface. The compression does not lead to the
release of porphyrin molecules into the aqueous phase, they remain distributed on
the surface. Subsequent transfer of metallosurfactant–porphyrin monolayer from
the air–water interface to quartz substrates has shown that Langmuir–Schaefer tech-
nique is more favorable than Langmuir–Blodgett one. The transfer ratios with the
first mentioned technique were close to 1. Further comparison of the intermolecu-
lar energy transfer between iridium metallosurfactant and porphyrin molecules in
solution and solid state has shown the effectiveness of energy transfer process in the
obtained Langmuir–Schaefer films. According to the luminescence spectrum of this
film, even when the metallosurfactant and porphyrin molecules were separated by a
lipid interlayer, the emission of the iridium metallosurfactant was totally quenched,
meaning energy transfer process to the porphyrin molecules. The subsequent sepa-
ration through the additional implementation of stearic acid interlayer to the above
film led to the emission of both metallosurfactant and porphyrin, meaning no energy
transfer.

Supramolecular aggregation has also been investigated for platinum complexes
in aqueous media. De Cola et al. synthesized 1,3-di(2-pyridine)-benzene complexes
of Pt(II) bearing hydrophilic chains of oligo(ethylene glycol) to increase solubility
in water. The obtained amphiphilic molecules show a tendency to aggregate
into phosphorescent hydrogels through the host–guest interactions between CDs
and oligo(ethylene glycol) tail of organoplatinum complexes(II) [66]. In ref. [67],
an amphiphilic cationic terpyridyl complex of Pt(II) containing a redox unit of
ferrocene aggregated in water with the formation of vesicular aggregates that
can be destroyed by a cucurbituril molecule capable of forming an equimolar
inclusion complex with metallosurfactant. Disassembly of vesicles was probably
associated with an increase in the hydrophilic nature of the ferrocene fragment
upon complexation with cucurbituril. Interestingly, well-defined architectures can
be reversibly switched using in situ electrochemistry. It is expected that this line
of research will lead to the development of a promising new class of responsive
vesicles for use in modern materials and drug delivery.
Metalloamphiphiles such as macrobicyclic hexamine ligands were investigated
as template agents in the synthesis of mesoporous silicas [68]. Three macrocyclic
metallosurfactants containing different alkyl chains and metals 9a–9c were used
for creation of the mesoporous silicate compositions. These metallosurfactants
form micelles [69], and, in particular, the cobalt complex 9c forms giant worm-like
micelles [38], which can promote the formation of the long cylindrical structures
required for the formation of mesoporous silica-based materials from the M41S
family. Copper-containing structures of porous silica aggregate at high temperatures

during the calcination, while cobalt-containing materials did not aggregate under
the same conditions [68]. Apparently, macrocyclic metallosurfactant was more
successfully incorporated into the structure of cobalt-containing silica, herewith
the metal was distributed throughout, and no signs of aggregation were observed.
However, in both cases well-ordered mesoporous materials with a highly developed
surface area were obtained.

As noted above, the inclusive interaction of macrocycle cavity with alkyl chain
of metallosurfactant most often leads to the destruction of the hydrophobic core
of metallosurfactant-based aggregates. However, the addition of a macrocycle to a
metallosurfactant can initiate joint aggregation, which promotes the spontaneous
formation of nanoparticles. In ref. [70], it was demonstrated for the first time that
electrostatic interaction between the sulfonate calix[4]resorcinarene and the com-
plex of lanthanum nitrate with two D-16 chains leads to the formation of mixed
aggregates that can act as cisplatin nanocontainers (Scheme 12.4). The encapsula-
tion of cisplatin into these aggregates enhances the cytotoxic activity against cancer
cells, which is an important step in the development of anti-cancer drugs with min-
imal side effects.

supramolecular metallotectons formed due to associative forces arranging into an
organized structure with specific architectural or functional features. Both alkylated
derivatives of metallomacrocycles and superamphiphilic complexes (macrocycle–
metallosurfactant) can be used as building blocks for creation of these metal-
lotectons. The key advantage of self-assembled functionalized nanoparticles is
the non-covalent association of many binding sites and functional groups, which
reduces synthetic efforts in the preparation of useful nano objects. These discoveries
enrich the library of new macrocyclic host molecules and provide a new platform
for the development of potential functional nanostructured materials.

Nanocomposites Based on Amphiphilic
Resorcinarenes and Metal Nanoparticles
Resorcinarenes are a well known class of macrocyclic compounds obtained by
condensation of resorcinol with aldehydes [71]. Resorcinarenes are analogues of
calixarenes and have found application in the separation technique and catalysis
[72–74]. Resorcinarenes tend to self-assemble into a variety of three-dimensional
structures both in solutions and in solid state [75]. Since the 2000s, resorcinarenes
were intensively studied as a dispersant of metal nanoparticles (MNPs) in water
and organic solvents. The nanocomposites based on resorcinarene and MNPs
demonstrate high structure resistance and versatile stability [76, 77]. They were
subsequently applied to create magnetic nanomaterials, structured optoelectronic
films, sensors, and catalytic systems [78].
Hydrophobic resorcinarenes with long alkyl chains on a low rim were applied for
stabilizing MNPs in organic media and for creation of nanomaterials with special
properties [79]. For example, nanodiamonds about 16 nm in size were selectively
isolated from a mixture of diamonds with an amino-substituted resorcinarene
cavitand and were applied in the construction of nanofilms with exceptional
stability and homogeneously [80]. Gold nanorods dispersed into the organic media
with benzylthiol- and dithiocarbamate-modified resorcinarenes demonstrate a sol-
vatochromic effect with a refractive index sensitivity of more than 300 nm/refractive
index unit [81]. The article [82] presents ferromagnetic CoNPs spontaneously assem-
bled into nanoscale “bracelets” upon dispersing phenylphosphonate resorcinarene
into an organic media.
Amphiphilic resorcinarene are usually utilized to obtain nanocomposites with
MNPs in aqueous media. The size, shape, and uniformity of nanocomposites
depend on the propensity of resorcinarenes to self-assemble forming different
resorcinarene-based architectures in aqueous media [83–85]. Several works
have been devoted to the creation of nanocomposites based on resorcinarene
with aminoethyl-acetamide groups, which significantly improves the stability of
inorganic nanoparticles in water [86]. In the article [87], the effect of the con-
centration of the aminoethyl-acetamide resorcinarene on stability and catalytic
activity of AuNPs is discussed. It was shown that an increase in the concentra-
tion of resorcinarene leads to a decrease in the size of AuNPs and an increase

in catalytic activity. In other works [88, 89] AuNPs and PtNPs stabilized with the
dimethylaminoethyl-acetamide resorcinarene were used for targeted delivery of
the anticancer drug methotrexate and as catalysts for photodegradation of toxic
dyes. The next article [90] describes the creation of microtubes decorated with
different MNPs such as AgNPs, AuNPs, PdNPs, and PtNPs. For the preparation,
aminoethyl-acetamide resorcinarenes with long alkyl tails at the lower rim (C11H23
and C15H31) were used. Unlike resorcinarene with nonyl tails, these resorcinarenes
aggregate in aqueous media into microtubes. Microtubes were decorated with MNPs
both during the self-assembly of resorcinarene and after their formation. Graphene
oxide modified with aminoethyl acetamide resorcinarene with pentyl groups was
used to deposit platinum and AuNPs with the formation of uniform and ordered
films [91]. The resulting composites were used as cathodic catalysts for oxygen
reduction and methanol oxidation, where they showed high catalytic activity.
Supramolecular and polymer nanocontainers based on carboxylate derivatives
of resorcinarene (CRA) were used to create catalytically active nanocomposites
with AgNPs. Nanocomposites were prepared by chemical reduction of silver nitrate
in the presence of stabilizing agents: amphiphilic resorcinarenes with decyl and
decenyl tails (CRA-C10) and polymer nanocontainers that were obtained by the
reaction of carboxylate derivative of resorcinarene-propanol with phenylboronic
acid (p(CRA-B), Scheme 12.5) [92, 93]. The use of amphiphilic resorcinarene
CRA-C10 leads to the formation of silver nanocrystals 4–6 nm in size, which are
organized into nanoparticles of 15–20 nm size. In the presence of polymer nanocon-
tainers p(CRA-B), the nanocrystals of 15–30 nm in size, formed upon reduction,

activity (Table 12.2). The difference in the catalytic activity of the composites is
mainly related to the permeability and lability of the stabilizing shell, and the size
of the AgNPs. The absence of an induction period is determined by the lability of
the amphiphilic shell. The supramolecular stabilizing layer, consisting of decyl and

12 Supramolecular Metal-Modiﬁed Nanocontainers Based on Amphiphilic and Hybrid Matrix
decenyl resorcinarene, facilitates the rapid passage of p-nitrophenol to the active
surface of AgNPs, on which the reaction of p-nitrophenol reduction occurs.
A hollow polymer nanocontainer consisting of viologen cavitands interconnected
by alkyl chains (p(MVCA-St), Scheme 12.6) [97] was used to create nanocompos-
ites with PdNPs. In contrast to simple viologen and viologen cavitand [98, 99],
p(MVCA-St) better stabilized PdNPs due to its multiply charged shell and flexible
structure that adapts to the aggregation of MNPs. The structure of nanocomposites
and their catalytic activity depends on the method of obtaining PdNPs. The pro-
duction of nanoparticles by the mediated electrochemical reduction of [PdCl4]2−
ions leads to the formation of PdNPs encapsulated in the nanocontainers’ cavity
Pd@p(MVCA-St) [95]. Upon chemical reduction with ascorbic acid, nanocompos-
ites are formed with the arrangement of PdNPs on the surface of the nanocontainer
Pd-p(MVCA-St) [94]. In all likelihood, the difference in structure is caused by
different rates of nanoparticle formation. In the course of electrochemical reduc-
tion, the formed palladium grains can penetrate through the walls of the polymer
shell and grow to nanoparticles in the cavity of p(MVCA-St). Upon chemical
reduction, nanoparticles are formed in solution and aggregate on the surface of
p(MVCA-St) into metal clusters.

Synthesis of p(MVCA-St) nanocomposites with PdNPs on the surface and

In
the
reduction
reaction
of
p-nitrophenol,
both
Pd@p(MVCA-St)
and
Pd-p(MVCA-St) nanocomposites exhibit catalytic activity that is significantly
higher than that of free PdNPs (Table 12.2, Figure 12.1b). The apparent rate
constant kapp for Pd-p(MVCA-St) is twice as large than for Pd@p(MVCA-St) and
is 0.0029 and 0.0014 s−1, respectively. An induction period is observed for both
composites and is much shorter in the case of Pd-p(MVCA-St). Such a high activity
of Pd-p(MVCA-St) is the result of its structure, where PdNPs are packed on the
surface of p(MVCA-St), which is the most optimal for catalytic activity. Moreover,
MNPs in clusters have a mutual effect on each other, which significantly improves
their catalytic properties [100–102].
Ni(II) ions are reduced to amorphous Ni(0), which covers the surface of
p(MVCA-St) to form composite Ni-p(MVCA-St) [96]. The reason being that amor-
phous nickel is a flexible polymeric structure of p(MVCA-St), which prevents Ni(0)

from crystallizing [103]. The catalytic activity of Ni-p(MVCA-St) is lower than
that of Pd-p(MVCA-St) (Table 12.2). Nickel forms an amorphous film that adsorbs
organic molecules well, and for this reason, the reduction reaction begins only five
minutes after mixing the reagents. After activation of the nickel surface, the reaction
proceeds in the same way as in the presence of a palladium catalyst (Figure 12.1b).
Recent scientific research has shown that bi- and polymetallic composites exhibit
better catalytic activity than monometallic composites. The reason is the mutual
influence of metals in composites, which leads to a change in their physical, elec-
tronic, and chemical properties [104, 105]. The catalytic activity of the bimetallic
nanocomposite PdNi-p(MVCA-St) significantly exceeds the activity of monometal-
lic composites (Table 12.2, Figure 12.1b). The reduction reaction of p-nitrophenol
proceeds without an incubation period and begins immediately after the addition of
the catalyst. The reaction takes eight minutes and the apparent rate constant kapp is
only 0.037 s−1.
Currently, the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction is one of the simplest and most
versatile methods for producing carbon–carbon bonds. It is widely used in fine
organic synthesis to produce biaryls [106]. Mono- and bimetallic nanocomposites
Pd-p(MVCA-St), Ni-p(MVCA-St), and PdNi-p(MVCA-St) were studied as catalysts
for the reaction of iodobenzene with phenylboronic acid. The results showed
that in the presence of nanocomposites, the Suzuki reaction proceeds under mild
conditions at room temperature in water (Table 12.3). Bimetallic composites have
better catalytic properties than monometallic ones. In the presence of 1 mol%
PdNi-p(MVCA-St), the reaction of iodobenzene with phenylboronic acid takes six
hours. The lowest activity is exhibited by the composite consisting of monometallic
nickel Ni-p(MVCA-St).

Conclusions
The data on metallosurfactants and their supramolecular systems indicate their
improved aggregation characteristics. A variety of morphological forms, high
practical potential, and the structure–property relationships established open up
the possibility of the most effective use of these compounds for solving technological
and biomedicinal problems. Beneficial properties of metallosurfactant-based nanos-
tructures are the combination of features typical for amphiphilic matrix, i.e. the

formation of dynamic self-assemblies with controllable characteristics capable of
providing the host domains with different active molecules (drugs, food or cosmetic
ingredients, pesticides, chemicals) along with advantages of metal-containing
derivatives, i.e. redox properties, electrophilic character, charge occurrence, cat-
alytic and luminescence properties, etc. Key benefit of self-assembling platform is
the possibility of noncovalent modification of nanocontainers thereby providing
them additional functionality. Meanwhile dynamic character of such polyfunctional
nanosystems is one of the limitations preventing their wide application in vivo. The
latter can be improved by their admixing with the covalently bound compounds,
e.g. macrocycles or/and polymers.
Macrocycle–metallosurfactant systems are also getting the attention of resear-
chers. Both covalent and noncovalent bonds are used as the driving forces to
fabricate these systems and supramolecular self-assemblies based on them. Macro-
cyclic unit can serve as the donor to coordinate with metal cations supplementing
the amphiphilic unit with the supramolecular recognition ability. Non-covalent
interactions of metallosurfactants with macrocycles can be used not only for
disassembly of metallosurfactant aggregates due to the formation of guest–host
complexes between the macrocycle and the metallosurfactant, but also for creating
new types of macrocyclic metallosurfactant, avoiding lengthy synthetic procedures
using organic solvents. The resulting macrocycle–metallosurfactant compositions
have great potential for applications in biomedicine, electroluminescent devices,
catalysis, gas adsorption and conversion.
While we mainly focus on biomedical applications of metal-modified nanocon-
tainers, it should be emphasized that they are multifunctional materials that
can find applications in a wide variety of modern technologies. One of the most
attractive contributions of metal-bearing compositions is related to the fabrication
of catalytic systems. Supramolecular catalysts are of special interest in this field
due to their biomimetic character, since the host–guest principles responsible
for binding the reagents inside the nanoreactors are similar to those of enzyme
catalysts. The final part of the review presents the results on the creation of
nanocomposite materials based on macrocyclic resorcinarenes and mono- and
bimetallic nanoparticles that demonstrate high structure resistance and versatile
stability. They were subsequently applied to create magnetic nanomaterials,
structured optoelectronic films, sensors, and catalytic systems. Depending on the
preparation method, composites with both encapsulated MNPs and MNPs on the
surface of polymer nanocontainers have been created. Bimetallic nanocomposites
exhibit better catalytic activity than monometallic ones both in the reduction of
p-nitrophenol and in the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction.

Introduction
The study of amphiphilic molecules began after the discovery of soap [1]. Advance-
ments in the solubilization of hydrophobic materials began the surfactant chemistry
in the twentieth century [2]. The tendency of amphiphilic aggregates to entrap
lipophilic entities in their hydrophobic core is a particularly interesting characteris-
tic of such compounds. Over the past few decades, surfactant-based aggregates have
attracted interest by researchers from diverse backgrounds. Generally, surfactants,
also called as “surface-active agents,” comprise a polar head group and a non-polar
tail (Figure 13.1). The polar group is hydrophilic and the non-polar long chain
organic portion is hydrophobic. Non-ionic, anionic, cationic, and zwitterionic form
four different classes of surfactants.
The alkyl chain length of the hydrophobic part of any surfactant contributes
strongly to its physical properties. At a particular concentration, known as the
critical aggregation concentration (CAC), or critical micelle concentration (CMC)
for micelles, the surfactant molecules aggregate to form assemblies such as micelles,
bilayers, and vesicles. Surfactants can be dissolved in both organic and aqueous
media. They tend to adsorb at interfaces and self-assemble spontaneously. The
arrangement of the assemblies also depends on the solvent polarity, hydrophobic
chain length, and surfactant properties (Figure 13.2). These are not only crucial
to the detergent industry, but also find applications in chemical processes, such as
catalysis and as self-assembled fluorescence detectors. Incorporation of transition
metal ions into surfactant assemblies, leading to formation of metallosurfactants,
can impart interesting and advanced functionalities for diverse applications.

Metallosurfactants
Metallosurfactants are surfactants in which the hydrophilic head usually binds to
a metal ion, generally, a d- or f-block metal ion, although in some cases the metal

ion may be present in the hydrophobic tail part or as a counter ion. This often leads
to intriguing applications not possible with the conventional surfactant systems and
individual metal ions. The incorporation of metal ions may impart magnetic char-
acteristics or catalytic features [3]. Metallosurfactants can serve as a template for
mesoporous materials [4], and have applications in catalysis [5], imaging [6], as a
nanoscale carrier for fluorescence sensing [7] and in optoelectronics [8].
Metallosurfactants bring together the adaptability of transition metals with
organic skeletons to obtain various supramolecular assemblies. The position of
metal ion within the metallosurfactant classifies them into three categories, i.e.
group I, group II, and group III metallosurfactants (Figure 13.2). In group I, the metal
ions are incorporated into the hydrophilic head group, while in group II, they are
positioned in the hydrophobic segment of the surfactant [2]. The metal ions in group
III act as counter ions and are thus weakly bound to the surfactant. The aggregation
of the metallosurfactants can create a range of assemblies such as micelles, vesicles,
and hybrid structures with different shapes and sizes (Figure 13.2). The type of
aggregation of the supramolecular assemblies depends on properties such as pH,
solvent, and/or concentration of different components [3].

13.2
Metallosurfactants as Nanosized Containers for
Self-assembled Molecular Devices
Metallosurfactant aggregates may range in size from micrometer assemblies to
nanometer structures. Here, we will focus on metallosurfactant aggregates, which
have sizes in the nanometric range. Each aggregate can be considered as a container.
Thus, the metallosurfactant assemblies can be treated as nanosized molecular con-
tainers capable of entrapping and concentrating lipophilic entities within a small
volume at relatively high concentration. Metallosurfactant aggregates are also
referred to self-assembled molecular devices. As components with different func-
tionalities are brought together, the nanosized container is formed via self-assembly
in the absence of any program-modulated procedure [2]. This chapter will focus on
the applicability of metalloaggregates, such as metallomicelles, metallovesicles, and
metallosomes, in the field of chemical sensing.
Chemosensors incorporate a material or chemical substance that can selectively
bind a specific analyte and a transducer that signals its presence [9]. Among the var-
ious signaling procedures, colorimetric and fluorometric detection have advantages
such as easy operation, low cost, high resolution, and sensitivity. Metalloaggregates
are among the materials that can be employed for chemosensing. The small size of
the metalloaggregates enables sensing at small scales with relatively little physical
interference. To exemplify, molecular systems with such dimensions are well suited
for intracellular monitoring.
Fluorescence-sensing applications are particularly prominent, due to high sensi-
tivity and relative ease of visual readout or instrumental readout [10, 11]. The basic
sensing mechanism is composed of three units: (i) a recognition unit, which binds
with the analyte, (ii) a fluorescent moiety for signal generation, and, (iii) a trans-
duction unit, which converts the recognition unit into a signal [12]. Fluorescence
sensors typically involve compounds with delocalized electrons in conjugated dou-
ble bonds such as polyaromatic compounds. Such polyaromatic compounds have
interaction site that can bind a specific analyte. The challenge with using such com-
pounds is their limited selectivity and tunability, which limits their applications.
Polyaromatic compounds generally have interaction sites that can bind multiple
analytes, which limits their application for specific tagging. Using the concepts of
supramolecular chemistry, groups of more sophisticated and sensitive fluorescence
sensors were developed and explored. This includes metallocyclic self-assemblies
that produce a modification in emission signal upon interaction with metal cations
or inorganic anions in metallocycle voids. However, multi-step synthesis procedures
are required, and the non-trivial architecture of the metallocycle supramolecular
structures can be a challenge.
Thus, protocols based on self-assembly offer advantages. Self-assembled metal-
loaggregates can serve as a template that drive the binding between a fluorescent
dye and a ligand. This leads to complexation of the metal ion resulting in quench-
ing of the fluorescence emission of the dye. Based on this mechanism, numerous
self-assembled chemosensors have been reported.

13.3
Surfactant Aggregates in Chemical Detection
Before proceeding to the application of metallosurfactants/metalloaggregates
as chemosensor, we will take a look at the advantages of employing surfactant
aggregates in chemical detection.
One attractive feature of self-assembling systems is that covalent linking between
two subunits is not required. Instead, the self-assembling approach remarkably sim-
plifies the chemosensor design, by reducing the challenges associated with conven-
tional covalent linking systems. The blend of chemosensors and self-aggregating
molecules can also give rise to new properties usually related to the conventional
properties detected with aggregates, including the concentration of ionic species and
the variety of microenvironment, which affect emissive features of the probe [7].
The localization of the species within aggregates imparts sensitivity and better
photophysical features to self-assembled systems. Hughes et al. [13] reported
micelle-solubilized fluorophores for identification and detection of explosives such
as trinitrotoluene (TNT), Royal demolition explosive (RDX), high melting explosive
(HMX), and trinitrophenylmethylnitramine (tetryl). The micellar solution was
composed of Tween-80 with solubilized pyrene as fluorophore. The difference in
tendency of these aromatic explosive compounds to quench the fluorescence signal
of pyrene was exploited. With the pyrene dye being localized inside the micelles
and the explosives molecules also entering the micelles, the quenching effect was
enhanced compared to free pyrene dye. Interference through quenching by oxygen
was also reduced. The micellar-based sensor array showed sensitivity of 19 μM.
A similar report on the use of a micellar sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) system for
investigation of Cu2+ quenching a fluorescent dye, 3-acetyl-4-oxo-6,7-dihydro-12H-
indolo-[2,3-a]-quinolizine (AODIQ), was published by Mallick et al. [14]. The inter-
action of Cu2+ with AODIQ generally leads to quenching. However, localizing the
dye molecules inside the SDS micelles and letting the metallic cations attach to the
anionic surface of the micelle significantly increased the quenching efficiency due
to the close proximity of the fluorophore and metal ions in the micellar assemblies.
Metal ion detection using aggregates has also been reported by Sasaki et al.
[15]. Their detection principle is based on an excimer–monomer equilibrium. This
involved vesicular aggregates from distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC) and
lipids labeled with a fluorescent functional group (pyrene) and a metal-chelating
functional group (iminodiacetic acid [IDA]) and derivatives thereof (Figure 13.3).
The metallosurfactant formation took place via coordination with oxygen atoms.
The emission spectrum of these lipids displays a sharp monomer emission peak
and a broad emission band attributed to the pyrene excimer. The sensing of four
divalent metal ions (Cu2+, Co2+, Mn2+, Ca2+) with metal-chelating lipid 1a was
investigated. Upon addition of a divalent metal ion, the excimer emission of pyrene
may convert into monomer emission. The change in ratio of signal intensities of
excimer and monomer (E/M) after the addition of a divalent metal ion formed the
detection approach.
The authors observed the excimer intensity to decrease with increasing Mn2+ con-
centration. The other divalent metal ions tested displayed a similar behavior but at

different metal concentrations. The authors also studied addition of metals to the
non-metal-chelating pyrene lipids 1b and 2 dispersed in DSPC vesicles and con-
cluded that the observed E/M changes happened due to metal chelation by IDA
headgroup, rather than metal-induced perturbations or fluorescence quenching. It
was proposed that metal ion binding with the IDA head group causes dispersal of
lipid 1a in DSPC matrix resulting in pyrene collision rate reduction and hence the
ratio E/M. The DSPC vesicular system was found to be most sensitive for Cu2+.
Roy et al. [16] reported a similar example, whereby four pyrene-containing lipids
(Figure 13.4) aggregated in liposomes were fabricated. The pyrene monomer fluo-
rescence signal got quenched on addition of cupric ions. The authors hypothesized
the quenching effect was due to cupric ions rather than lipid redistribution in the
liposomes. The fluorescence signal did not alter when three other transition metal
ions (Ni2+, Hg2+, Zn2+) were utilized, which is indicative of the selectivity of the
system.
13.4
Self-Assembled Moieties as Fluorescent Sensors
As illustrated by the examples above, the blending of a fluorescence quenching sens-
ing system with surfactant-based aggregates results in promising features and behav-
iors for chemosensors.
The major advantage of the self-assembling technique is the ability to modify or
change the components with molecules that are readily, even commercially, avail-
able to scan and optimize parameters.

Grandini et al. [17] proposed a route involving the self-assembly of a fluorescent
dye and a receptor inside surfactant-based micellar aggregates. No direct interaction
between the receptor and dye took place until they were confined in close proximity
inside the small volume of the hydrophobic interior of the aggregate.
A transduction mechanism in the form of fluorescence signal readout is required
to signal the binding event. This can be challenging if there is no covalent bond
between the receptor and the fluorescent dye. The authors here investigated a system
composed of a dye molecule, 8-anilinonaphthalensulfonic acid (ANS), with decyl-
glycylglycine (GlyGly). These were localized in micellar aggregates formed from
cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). The system enabled the selective bind-
ing of Cu2+ ions in slightly acidic or neutral pH conditions due to amide nitrogen
deprotonation.
This quenched the fluorescence signal of GlyGly–ANS construct. The fluorescence
properties of the ANS dye are sensitive to the polarity of the chemical environment;
ANS does not fluorescence in water, but does become fluorescent in the less polar
micellar environment. The authors suggested that this effect reduced background
fluorescence. Varying the ratio of sensing molecules to surfactants, the best readout
was achieved at 1 : 2. By decreasing the surfactant concentration, the detection range
could be modified. The self-assembly process is simple involving little or no struc-
tural modifications of the chemosensor. Rapid screening of experimental conditions
can take place to optimize the sensing protocol. Due to the simplicity of this
procedure, 16 combinations could be tested with four different surfactants and dyes.

In a further study, Berton et al. [18] used GlyGlu and GlyLys dipeptides. Both the
free and copper-complexed form of the dipeptides were amphiphilic and formed
homo-aggregates without the addition of any surfactant moieties allowing transition
from a three-component system to a two-component system (Figure 13.5a,b). The
simple modification of the dye co-micellized within the systems enabled the authors
to study, investigate, and optimize interactions of the latter. The results reported
surfactant-based self-assembling methodology to be efficient enough to synthesize
sensitive sensors.
13.5
Metallosurfactants and Detection Protocol
Moving on to the metallosurfactants, chemosensing systems were synthesized using
either the metallosurfactants or metalloaggregates as reported by Tao et al. [19].
They reported a sensor employing quinoline molecules as both structure-directing
agents and ligands. In a one-step sol–gel synthesis process, a mesoporous silica
material was produced with an amphiphilic quinoline derivative and tetraethylor-
thisilicate (TEOS) arranging into nanochannels filled by the amphiphilic derivative.
Upon addition of Al3+ to nanochannels, a fluorescent metallomicelle–silica nan-
ocomposite material was obtained (Figure 13.6). The fluorescence signal of
hybrid QC12Et3Br-Al3+/silica complex could be quenched by pyrophosphate and
phosphate. QC12Et3Br-Al3+ is a quinoline-based amphiphilic ligand featuring a

12-carbon chain with positively charged head and ligand tail with Al3+. The limit of
detection was determined as 10.23 μM with linear range from 57.50 to 1696.00 μM.
When mixing the fluorescent powder with methyl methacrylate (MMA), the
complex could be polymerized into a film, rod, or other shapes, which could be
used for incorporating this material into a display or sensor device.
Guerrero-Martínez [20] along with coworkers presented an interesting example
of inclusion of two fluorescent dyes in surfactant self-assembly. The formation
of metalloaggregates was carried out by attaching long-chain hydrocarbons to
form electron–donor iridium and electron–acceptor ruthenium complexes, both
containing dialklybipyridine as hydrophobic part of the aggregate (Figure 13.7).
The authors compared the absorption and emission properties of the prepared
metallosurfactants with their analogues [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 and [Ir(ppyFF)2(bpy)]Cl,
where bpy is 2,2′-bipyridine and ppy is 2-phenylpyridine. The dilution-dependent
switching of the electron transfer process in the co-micellar aggregate formed the
basis of emission signal, which could be tuned by varying the ratio of the inert and
functional surfactants.
The pH-sensing ability of the metalloaggregates has also been explored by various
groups. Worlinskya et al. [21] tuned the pH-sensing range of [meso-tetraaryl-
porpholactonato]M(II) complexes by investigating the effect of different metal
ions (M = Zn(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), Pd(II), Ag(II), Pt(II)), the aryl group substitu-
tion (Ar = C6H5, C6F5), and introduction of a nitro group. Both β-nitration and
pentafluorophenyl had additive effects, and the optical response was found to
be stronger for the pentafluorophenyl-substituted derivative. The basic sensing
mechanism begins with the nucleophilic attack of hydroxide on lactonic carbonyl.
The interactions are stabilized by intermolecular interactions between oxygen and
the pentafluorophenyl group. Zinc, silver, and copper complexes constituted more
price-competitive options in comparison to platinum.

Lei et al. [22] fabricated Ru(II) complexed mesostructured silica with the aid
of CTAB surfactant template for optical sensing of oxygen. For validation of the
method, the authors also checked the optical sensing capability of [Ru(bpy)2
phen]Cl2 loaded into the matrix. The covalently grafted samples showed minimal
leaching. The effect of aging time on the sensitivity and stability was observed
to be so small that it could be neglected. Figure 13.8 illustrates the time-resolved
decay curves transition from double to single exponential, resulting into linear
Stern–Volmer plots.
In a similar report by Zhang et al. [23], oxygen-detecting materials consisting of
[Ru(phen)3]2+ decorated to the functionalized MSU-3 fabricated by tetraethoxysi-
lane and functionalized Ru(II) complex [Ru(Phen)2Phen-Si]2+ (Phen = 1,10-
phenanthroline, Phen-Si = 2-[4′-{3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl}phenyl]imidazo[4,5-f]-1,
10-phenanthroline) using Pluronic P123 surfactant as template were synthesized.
The results were compared with a matrix incorporated with just [Ru(phen)3]2+.
The luminescent signal quenching of the Ru(II) complex by oxygen and the
Stern–Volmer analysis was discussed by the authors. The deviation from the
linear response could be attributed to different microenvironments in the matrix.
Hence, by employing grafting strategy, one can aim to prepare organometallic
complex-doped devices.
Metallosurfactants also find applications as imaging agents and even bimodal
imaging agents. For example, Xu et al. explored fluorescent nanoparticles with

Gd(III) metallosurfactant and cross-linked organosilica as bimodal imaging agents
[24]. The co-assembly of the amphiphilic Gd(III) complex with Pluronic F127
entrapped with conjugated polymeric nanoparticles (CPNs) in the core organosil-
ica displayed a very strong fluorescence intensity using optical measurements
(Figure 13.9). A good biocompatibility was suggested by the low cytotoxicity
parameters.
In another report by Adams et al. [25], the emissive properties of monolayered
RubpySS, IrbpySS, and OsbpySS in the presence of fluorinated surfactants and their
capacity for adsorption of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and fetal bovine serum (FBS)
were explored. It was anticipated that fluorinated surfactants prevent agglomera-
tion of metal complexes-coated gold nanostructures (Figure 13.10). The lifetime of
ruthenium tris-bipyridyl complex coated to gold surface increased significantly.
Dominguez-Gutierrez et al. [26] studied the formation of metallosurfactant
assemblies with time-resolved spectroscopy. The authors employed luminescent
ruthenium complexes-based metallosurfactant assemblies using [Ru(bpy)3]2+ unit
as a head group. The morphology of the aggregates changed with monomer and
choice of solvent. A range of complexes were fabricated, and the photophysical
behavior of metallosurfactants both in the absence and presence of aggregates was
studied in hexane and ethanol solutions. The higher degree of scatter for time
profiles in hexane than ethanol indicated micelles or vesicles formation.

Similarly, a review article published by Owen and Butler [27] elaborates on coordi-
nation of various transition metal ions to biologically derived amphiphiles relevant
to bio-inorganic chemistry.
There are many reports published exploring the redox and photophysical proper-
ties of metal complexes featuring self-aggregation tendencies through intermolecu-
lar interactions. Probing the environment of the metal center can lead to luminescent
metallosurfactants that can potentially be applied in bio-imaging, thin-film opto-
electronics, and mesoporous materials. The variability of luminescent properties of
amphiphilic complexes has not been investigated much. A recent article by Mauro
et al. [28] reported the synthesis of luminescent iridium metallosurfactant complex
molecules soluble in an aqueous medium. A cyclometallated phenyl pyridine Ir(III)
picolinate phosphorescent core with long alkyl chain terminated at sulfate group
was investigated (Figure 13.11). Aggregation behavior was studied by varying the
counterion, and results were compared with the parental non-amphiphilic com-
pounds. Sodium derivatives were found to exhibit a strong aggregation tendency.
Such compounds show potential applications in the fields like bio-imaging and tag-
ging. Hence, the authors demonstrated the fabrication of a new class of metallosur-
factants following the reverse strategy bearing a neutral and phosphorescent core,
which possessed solubility in both aqueous and organic media. The counterion was
observed to govern the nature of aggregates, and hence different aggregation charac-
teristics were observed in case of tetrabutylammonium and sodium. High zeta poten-
tial values confirmed a highly negative surface near the aqueous phase. A significant
blue shift in the emission spectra and prolonged excited state lifetimes indicated that
the fabricated aggregates were not affected much by the presence dioxygen and water
in comparison to the monomeric compounds.

Garcia et al. [29] studied the effect of solvent polarity to probe an iron(II)
complex with diamine ligands. The authors synthesized and investigated the
solvatochromic
behavior
of
cis-bis(4,4′-dinonyl-2,2′-bipyridine)dicyanoiron(II)
by using (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2⋅5H2O as a precursor for Fe. It was observed that solva-
tochromic characteristics were related to the complex cis-[Fe(bpy)2(CN)2], which is
insoluble in low-polarity solvents. The attachment of two nonyl groups introduced
solvent polarity probing features in the lipophilic systems. Hence, the authors
inferred that the complex constituted a new metallosurfactant, which forms vesi-
cles in water-dominant media. The solvatochromic properties make aggregation
self-indicated. Thus, the complex exhibits promising collaborative effect of redox
reactivity and solvation effect.
The emission behavior of Ru–surfactant complexes was also studied by Nehru
et al. [30]. The authors synthesized a series of water-soluble Ru-complexes bear-
ing different head groups and chain sizes. An in-depth analysis of thermodynamic
characteristics, CAC, and hydrophobic features was carried out. With the increase
in the length of chain and size of aromatic group, a decrease in the CAC values was
observed. However, the hydrophobic character and the size distribution increased.
The spherical self-assembled ruthenium–surfactant vesicles were monodispersed in
nature and featured a green emission with high stability in an aqueous medium. Due
to the fluorescent properties of synthesized metallovesicles, they could be employed
for biomedical and material applications.
Draeger et al. [31] illustrated the formation of fluorescent emissive metallomi-
celles derived from tris-bipyridyl ruthenium hexaphosphate with a back-to-back
ruthenium complex bilayer featuring a headgroup with the alkyl portion pointing
inward and outward. Two 2,2′-(bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) units were combined
with amphiphilic dipyridyl and Ru(II) hexafluorophosphate. The luminescent
properties were explored by forming a suspension of the complexes in water
and exciting the molecules at 640 nm. The granular micro crystallites imparted
strong emission to the aggregates. The solution turned turbid in a matter of
15–20 minutes and remained stable for weeks. Redox-active compounds such
as phenyl-p-benzoquinone, tris(acetylacetonato)manganese(III), manganese(III)
meso-p-tetracarboxylatoporphyrinate
(TCPP),
and
naphthoquinonesulfonate
(NQS−) were found to quench the fluorescence signal of the colloidal solution.
Among them, maximum quenching of about 50% could be seen in case of NQS−.
No changes were seen when solid micellar spheres were deposited onto solid gold,
mica, and graphite layer when investigated with atomic force microscopy on day
1 and 3 weeks later. Negatively charged quenchers were found to be stronger than
positive or neutral moieties. Similarly, Garg et al. [32] synthesized mono and dual
alkyl chain chromium-based metallosurfactants and investigated their interactions
with xanthene dyes with the aid of fluorescence and UV/vis spectroscopy. Analysis
of the photophysical properties of xanthene dyes in monomeric and aggregated
form of the metallosurfactants was carried out. Both of the dyes investigated were
found to bind through one site with these metallosurfactants. The incorporation of
chromium ions in the surfactants resulted in the formation of a metallosurfactant

with high thermal stability and affinity for xanthene dyes. This is assumed to be an
effective pathway for detection of drugs in biological applications.
Hallett et al. [33] investigated the cellular uptake of fluorescent rhenium com-
plexes bearing thiazole/imidazole group as a function of their lipophilicity. Due to
their large emission, these may have applications in cellular imaging. Fluorescence
cellular imaging was conducted on a fish parasite (Spironucleus vortens [S. vortens])
and yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe). Cellular uptake, toxicity, and localization
were influenced by the lipophilicity of the ligands. An increase in lipophilicity of
the alkyl chains imparted greater toxicity. Complexes of medium lipophilicity were
found to exhibit reasonable uptake at no toxicity. Complexes with appropriate lig-
ands could serve as possible radio-imaging nuclei by sustaining the physical proper-
ties for imaging using confocal fluorescence microscopy.
13.6
Conclusions
This chapter has highlighted how metallosurfactant aggregates can serve as
nanocontainers, stabilized by electrostatic, ionic, lipophilic, or hydrophobic inter-
actions. By concentrating fluorescent molecules into the small volumes of the
container, and exploiting phenomena such as fluorescence quenching, metal-
loaggregates have applications in the fields of sensing, labeling, bio-imaging, and
magnetic resonance imaging. In comparison to the complicated synthesis protocols
and “difficult to tune” selectivity associated with conventional non-micellar sensors,
the self-assembled sensors are more efficient and “easy to synthesize.” A relatively
limited number of reports exist on applications of metallosurfactants, leaving plenty
of room for researchers to explore and investigate, for drug delivery, resonance
imaging, solvochromatics, drug design, and many more.
