Foreword by John Canaday
The American newspaper comic
strip
(like jazz
and the movies)
is a major innovative and crea-
tive
cultural
accomplishment
of
the
United
States, one
that
has
spread around
the
world.
From
the
outset,
the comics were widely
read
and enjoyed by
the American
public,
oblivious
to cultural
history or
art
criticism. But
for
sev-
eral decades, historians of the arts and scholarly
critics
mostly
shunned
the
supposedly
lowly
comic
strips,
largely
l)ecaiise the
finest of
thi'se
features
originally appeared
in
the
sensational
popular
press.
Fortunately,
this
situation
has
changed, and
those
in
positions
of authority
in
American arts and literature are now taking the
comics
seriously,
recognizing
the
often
subtly
imaginative, splendidly inventive, and creatively
memorable
<|iialitics of the best products of this
national art.
Although essentially a narrative art, comic strips
have provided
an
extraordinary
vehich'
for
in-
spired
graphic
and
narrative
experimentation
and
accomplisliment
for
major
comic-strip
ar-
tists,
including
VVinsor McCay
(Little Nemo),
Lionel
Feininger
(The
Kin-tler-Kuh).

Scgar
(Thimble
Theatre),
George
Ilerriman
(Krazij Kat), Cliff Stcrrett
(Pollij and Her Pais),
Roy Crane
(\Va.v/i

and
many
others.
First-rate comics can
be enjoyed
both
as
"gal-
lery" art and
in continuity
iis fiction or drama.
Included
in
this
.Smithsonian

are

I have enormous respect
for the comic strip as a
potential story and art
form,
although far too few
of its productions have
realized that potential.
If those few,
however,
could be gathered into some
sort of complete collection,
the effect on those who
have scorned the comics as
a whole might well be
devastating.

Foreword
You have to be lucky enough to have been around for a rather long stretch of years
say seven decades—to remember a time when newspaper comics were just newspaper
comics rather than sociological documents and works of art with their own set of inno-
vative esthetic principles, which they have become.
If you have been really lucky,
luckier than all but a handful of people I know, the comics are tied to the time when
you were a small boy in a small town about a hundred miles from Kansas City and
your weekly reward for good behavior in Sunday school was five cents for a copy of
the Sunday Kansas City Star. Along with reports of the sinking of the Titanic in 1912,
the declaration of war in Europe in 1914, and other events in the fictional area out-
side a ten-mile radius from the Bourbon County Court House in Fort Scott, the Star
kept you abreast of the adventures of the Katzenjammer Kids, Happy Hooligan, Bus-
ter Brown, and other familiar personalities of the real world.
The transmutation of the old newspaper comics from their initial character as en-
tertainments to be read lying on your stomach on the Hoor before Sunday dinner, into
their current status as sociological testaments for intellectual evaluation, as demon-
strated by this book, pleases me, since
it is always reassuring to see that solid respect-
ability may follow thoughtless youth. But my own response to the comics reproduced
here is not at all intellectual. The early ones reduce me to a quivering jelly of nostal-
gia, which
is the condition of remembering how sweet hfe used to be and forgetting
how terrible it was. This holds up to about the time I was eight, when we moved from
Kansas to Texas.
The years from eight to twelve were my collector's period, with suit boxes filled
with thousands of strips clipped from daily papers and
filed
b\' date and subject.
Upon entering high school I threw the collection out as kid stuff, and for the next four
years the comics, although assiduously followed, occupied a residual spot in my atten-
tion, badgered as
I was, as everybody
is at that time, by geysers of hormones. The
trouble with having been lucky enough to know newspaper comics shortly after 1907
and up to 1919
is that you have to settle for the 1920s for your teen-age years, and
there never was a much more embarrassing time for an adult to look back on. Teen-
agers since then have passed through more dangerous, more violent, and more tragic
periods, but not more embarrassing ones. We were silly, let's let it go at that.
The point in mentioning that period here is that in spite of so much that is painful
to recall, my early
teens were marked by one discovery that saves my self-respect.
This was Krazij Kat. Krazy was not a general
favorite with my contemporaries
adolescent or adult. They liked Barney Google and Moon Mullins. So did I. The more
sophisticated
of my colleagues went
for Toonerville
Trolley.
So did
I. But they
couldn't see what was fimny about Krazy Kat. nor could they see that that was exactly
the point—that Krazy tcasn't funny. He/she was
(is, and surely always wall be)
a
combination of a lot of things, including hilarious, but not funny.
In 1926 Gilbert Seldes in The Seven Lively Arts wrote the famous essay on Krazy,
celebrating Kokonino Kounty and its inhabitants on a philosophical premise identify-
ing Krazy with Don Quixote, but this was several years after I used to go through the
Strouds's discarded copies of the San Antonio Light to find Krazy. My father refused
to have a Hearst paper in the house and the Strouds, less fussy, lived next door.

\ATienever self-doubts as to my intellectual capacit>', my poetic sensitivity, my criti-
cal acumen, or my humanistic discernment threaten to sink me, I can always surface
on my record as a precocious member of what was to become a Kult. Krazy also saved
me later in
life: The only explanation
I can see as to why my mistakes as a parent
didn't scar my offspring is that Krazy, by then collected in a book with another ap-
preciation by e e cummings, was always at hand instead of the literary' pap usually
fed to kiddies. Within the family we mastered Krazy s dialect for use on special occa-
sions, and could recite back and forth the dialogues from favorite episodes.
It sounds
precious and would have been precious
if there had been anything self-conscious or
Kultish about it, but it wasn't like that. Krazy was a kind of pet, mascot, and Keeper of
the Peace around our house, a benign presence and good example even today from
his/her spot on the bookshelf.
Somehow I never managed to get really involved with any of the comics later than
Krazy—a loss for me, I'm sure, which this book may correct. There was a brief period
at the University of Virginia when it was voguish among the young professors to pre-
tend to be fascinated with Mary Worth. We would
tell each other we could hardly
wait to find out how she would straighten out so-and-so's troubles. But it was all pretty
phony, a kind of reverse academicism. During those years I remember also stumbling
over stacks of comic books upstairs in the boys' room, probably Buck Rogers and
Superman operating on different wave lengths from Krazy 's in the library downstairs.
But I never looked into these.
So I lost track of the comics. The closest I ever came to post-Krazy involvement was
in the spring of 1944, serving in the Marine Corps with Alex Raymond, who relin-
quished the authorship of Flash Gordon
in order to enlist with a group of officer-
trainees at Quantico, Virginia. Raymond was held
in downright veneration by the
rest of the class; even the drill sergeant, who was otherwise the meanest man in the
world, regarded him as a rare and fragile object that might shatter if commanded to
shoulder arms in too rough a tone of voice, giving me some idea of the power that
comics still held in America—and, I am sure, still do.
The comics are ubiquitous. You don't have to have followed a strip for its identity
to have somehow entered your consciousness: the comics affect your way of feeling
about the daily world whether or not you read them. So far as I can tell, the effect on
me has been salutary, and I am content with the idea of strengthening
it with the aid
of this anthology. The function of art, we are told,
is to clarify, intensify, or enlarge
our experience, and the comics are now art. Without much expectation of clarifica-
tion, or of intensification,
let me now set about expanding my boundaries.
In
the
meanwhile, although grateful for this book,
I am also grateful for the time-scheme
that allowed me to know the comics when.

Introduction
a
The Comic Treasures of the
American Newspaper Page
The elements of the American comic strip were already there. A succession of draw-
ings expressing a continuous action, an anecdotal event, a narrative—they are as old
as cave paintings and had been vividly rendered in European art, in Greek temple
reliefs, and in Giotto frescoes. "Talk balloons," speeches oflFered in encircled, smoke-
like wisps from the mouths of characters, were fairly common in eighteenth-centur>'
caricature, and graphic caricature was fairly commonplace by the mid-nineteenth cen-
tury. And so, in the British "comic papers," were captioned cartoon narratives offer-
ing, usually in broad burlesque, farcical incident and anecdote which largely derived
from the conventions of circus clowning and the music hall-vaudeville sketch.
It remained for the United States, then entering fully into its own era of mass com-
munications, to put
all these elements together and make something new of them,
something new and compelling, and so
irresistible that
it spread
(along with our
movies and our music ) around the world.
Only in the past decade has the American newspaper comic
strip begun
to be
recognized in its own country as an innovative and creative cultural accomplishment.
It has long been hailed in France and elsewhere in Europe as one of the important
achievements in the arts of this century, and it has been studiously examined there in
a number of journals exclusively devoted to the subject.
That is perhaps not so exceptional or extreme a cultural default as
it may at first
seem. Notoriously, Europeans—and particularly the French—have recognized,
re-
searched, praised
( and sometimes overpraised )
the American arts—our movies, our
jazz, our comics—before we have. And it would perhaps not be too chauvinistic to
point out that we have produced those things,
after
all, and loved them, and that
scholarship, art criticism, and cultural history are secondary pursuits.
At the same time, many of our own historians of the arts, having borrowed their
principles, procedures, and attitudes largely from European cultural historians, have
proceeded to apply those principles only to such traditional categories as we have bor-
rowed directly from abroad—to literary history, to the theater, to concert music, and
the like, sometimes pausing to scorn or reject those artistic genres that are particularly
American, like the movies, jazz, and the comics. Europeans, meanwhile, have applied
their principles of cultural history and criticism in modified form to those American
creations and transmutations which we
still think of as our "popular" or even our
"light" artistic pursuits.
Thus the comic strip has been
critically neglected in the United States, and has
even been openly attacked. But a further, and perhaps crucial reason for the neglect
of the comics lay in the aversion of most well-educated Americans of every political
persuasion for the sensational press of the turn of the century and later. The profes-
11

sors, teachers, prelates, and literati of the time usually did not see these newspapers
as colorful and amusing but saw them instead as vicious, crude, and frightening in
their instant and openly demagogic appeal to a mass readership. And the papers they
most grimly eschewed—the Hearst
titles connected in a chain from coast to coast,
the Chicago Tribune, the New York World (until 1920), the New York Daily News
—were precisely the papers which carried the largest array of comic strips by the
most talented
artists. The papers most respected and read by these educators and
tastemakers—the New York Times, the New York Herald Tribune, the Boston Tran-
script, the Baltimore Sun—carried fewer strips, and the Times carried
( and carries
)
none at all.
Comics seemed to the elite the obviously lowbrow Pied Piper which lured the inno-
cents to their journalistic doom at the hands of the Hearsts, McCormicks, and Pulit-
zers. Weren't Krazy Kat, Little Nemo, Buster Brown, Happy Hooligan, and the Kat-
zenjammer Kids being paid
for and
distributed by Hearst? They must
therefore
be tainted by his
political ambitions and
social
attitudes; any intrinsic merit they
might possess as works of art was perhaps accidental, certainly irrelevant, and surely
best ignored.
The majority of those in authoritative positions in American literature and art dur-
ing the first half of this century simply may not have seen the more subtly imagina-
tive,
gorgeously
inventive, and
creatively memorable
strips
at
all because
these
exciting works were being published in the wrong papers. And concomitantly, they
overlooked the colorfully bound strip reprint volumes issued by minor publishers at
the time, both as entertainment for themselves and as gifts for their children.
At the same time, even the most gifted and creatively involved comic-strip artists
tended to hold themselves and their work in a modest and unpretentious low regard.
They made small jokes about their strips in public, surrendered their original art to
their employing syndicates without expecting or wanting its return, supplied funny
anecdotes for superficial articles about their careers, sighed after "serious" art pur-
suits, and—perhaps worst for the historian— maintained virtually no reference
files
of their own work.
Similarly, our libraries have been negligent. Many would not even stock the New
York Graphic or certain of the Hearst newspapers. Only one substantial book has ever
been devoted to the Graphic, possibly the most iconoclastically innovative newspaper
in American history. A scant half dozen have been written about Hearst's highly im-
portant chain of journals. And none has yet appeared on the New York Daily News or
the Chicago Tribune. A side result was the failure of the New York Public Library to
maintain any comprehensive file of Hearst's New York Journal, crucial to the study of
journalism as well as to that of the comic strip. And indeed the New York Graphic
has apparently not survived at all; there may be no file of that paper, public or private,
left on earth.
Had the comic-strip material which ran in the shunned popular press been pub-
lished instead by Vanity Fair or The New Yorker, or had
it reached the august pages
of the New York Times, there can be little doubt that the best example" of the strip
form would have readily received the critical accolades and appreciative discussion
they should have had from the outset. As
it
is, we have missed such theoretical re-
wards as H. L. Mencken's comments on E. C. Segar's Thimble Theatre as Americana
and sustained comic narrative; Lionel Trilling's consideration of the renovation of the
Dickensian character in the literature of the comic strip; Kenneth Burke's analysis of
linguistic symbol and graphic leitmotif in the popular inythos of the strips; and Ed-
mund Wilson's consideration of the potential of Edward Corey's working with the
sustained characters and narrative of the comic strip.
Still and
all, there have been some nine studies of historical and critical substance
dealing with the newspaper strips published in the United States since 1897. Perhaps
there is some record of appreciation of a national art form after all.

This collection presents, in a single volume, an extensive gallery of newspaper comics,
an anthology which the editors hope
ofiFers some memorable and amusing art and
narrative.
The comic strip is essentially a narrative art. A well-conceived
story, character, or
incident can make clumsy or barely competent
art work
functionally acceptable,
much as a strong story and good character actors may redeem
films with
slipshod
camera and directorial work. Indeed, some strip artists were, by strict standards of
draftsmanship or graphics, no artists at
all. What they had was a point of view (a
sometimes rowdy point of view, to be sure ) on the human animal and his attitudes
and actions, and a functional means to convey it.
Still, the art of the comic strip did provide an extraordinary' vehicle for inspired
graphic experimentation and accomplishment by some major comic-strip
artists,
in-
cluding Winsor McCay,
Lyonel
Feininger, George Herriman,
ClifiF
Sterrett, Roy
Crane, Milton Caniff, and others whom the reader will readily note in the following
pages.
As we indicate, however, it was as a challenge to the storytelling imagination that the
comic strip stirred its most striking response among creative minds, and it brought to
light a number of talents who were able to use its highly individual techniques of con-
tinuity to often remarkable advantage. Compare,
for example, the graphic compe-
tence of Roy Crane in his Wash Tubbs stor\' in this volume with that of E. C. Segar
in the Thimble Theatre narrative. Crane's sensitive mastery of pictorial composition
and technique is self-evident (his panels in the Tubbs whaling sequences are as defdy
evocative of the cetacean majesty and movement as Rockwell Kent's illustrations for
Moby Dick), and they are in sharp contrast to Segar's obviously limited graphic con-
cerns. However, both artist-narrators were readily able to spin stories of arresting in-
cident, humor, strong characterizations, and sustained plot interest, and few readers
can resist the compulsion to read their narratives raptly through to the end.
Thus the dual purpose of this collection reflects the remarkable dichotom>- of the
strip medium
itself, shared only with cinema, in that
its best works can be enjoyed
both as "gallery" art and in continuity as fiction or drama.
Indeed, this division of esthetic possibihty
is reflected in the divergent emphases of
the only two national institutions at present devoted in full or great part to comic-strip
art:
the Museum of Cartoon Art in Greenwich, Connecticut, which
is largely con-
cerned with rotating displays of original strip drawings; and the San Francisco Acad-
emy of Comic Art, which files all of the printed strips, so they can be studied in rela-
tion to other printed narrative arts, as story-carrying material.
The comic
strip may
functionally be
defined
as
a
serially published,
episodic,
open-ended dramatic narrative or series of linked anecdotes about recurrent, identi-
fied characters, told in successive drawings regularly enclosing ballooned dialogue or
its equivalent and minimized narrative text.
Not all the features contained herein
fit that functional definition, in detail, to be
sure. Johnny Gruelle's Mr. Twee Deedle, for example, has no ballooned dialogue and
might actually be considered a kind of comic version of an illustrated children's book.
Similarly, the comics page Tarzan, in any of its several versions over the years,
is a
condensed-narrative, fantasy-adventure tale in text-and-illustration form.
The American comic strip
first attained
definitive form
in a Sunday Yellow Kid
page, drawn by Richard Felton Outcault for William Randolph Hearst's American
Humorist weekly comic supplement to his New York Journal, on October 18, 1896.
The immediate progenitor of the comic strip was probably the illustrated novel of
the nineteenth century, which in England, France, and the United States usually fea-
tured caricature and cartoon art as intimate accompaniment to the texts of such popu-
lar authors as Dickens, Thackeray, Balzac, Hugo, and others. But the strip failed to
13

develop as an immediate outgrowth of the reading pubUc's enormous rehsh for car-
toon-supported narrative in the 1830s and
1840s. A Pickwick comic strip, issued
in
bound parts by the same pubHsher who originally hired Dickens to write text for the
popular cartoons
of Robert Seymour,
thus
bringing
Pickwick Papers
into
being,
might seem in retrospect to have been a likely event. With art by Phiz
( Hablot Knight
Browne) and script and balloon dialogue by Dickens, such a work might well have
had wide popularity. But
it would have taken a prescient imagination to conceive of
a full-fledged fictional narrative being carried forward by means of dialogue within
successive drawings, much as drama was performed on a stage, and without need of
extensive prose explication. Such an imagination did not exist in Dickens's time, not
even in his own fertile and graphically oriented mind.
Any narrative that was presented by means of short sets of successive drawings
was largely limited
to pantomimic pratfall gags and occasional
simplistic
political
parables. In these forms, captions and dialogue, whether presented outside or within
the panels, essentially served as embellishment to the art. In the Outcault Yellow Kid
of October 18, 1896, however, the whole point of the vaudeville gag depended on the
dialogue between the Kid and the parrot, and that was the first time this had occurred
in a graphic work which also met the other prerequisites of the strip form.
Both Outcault's publisher,
Hearst, and
his fellow cartoonists on the staff of the
American Hunwri.sf were quick to perceive and to pursue the broad possibilities the
Yellow Kid's turn with a comic-dialogue payoff had for the comic-character features
the Humorist was then emphasizing. The crucial and relevant effect of rapidly ex-
changed dialogue in a Weber and Fields vaudeville skit could now be paralleled in
comic art. Possibly Outcault's innovation struck the Humorist staff in something of the
same way that the direct addition of .sound to film struck most workers in the silent-
movie industry, startling them into a realization of expressive possibilities undreamed
14

of. Cartoonists of the time had" long been wedded to the notion that art of any kind
should exist well apart from prose exposition, like a kind of frozen tableau.
Outcault himself promptly seized with relish on the potential of the art form he had
created, enlarging on the dialogue and prose essentials of the comic
strip with pio-
neering gusto and imagination, as did his companions in the new field. By the turn of
the century, dialogue and art had been commonly wedded in the newspaper comics.
And by the 1930s comics in which dialogue was minimal or nonexistent, such as
J.
Carver Pusey's Bennij and Carl Anderson's Hetny, were regarded as inventive and
original in their refreshing departure from convention.
Prolonged graphic narrative was an obvious step for cartoonists turning out weekly
newspaper strips to take, and two of Outcault's confreres on the Hearst Journal, Ru-
dolph Dirks (whose Katzenjammer Kick had entertained readers since 1896) and Fred
Opper (the creator of the comic strip's own divine and Dostoevskian
Idiot, Happy
Hooligan) were the first to carry thematic concepts from one week's strip episode to
the next. Other early strip artists to enlarge on narrative possibilities and to develop
actual cliff-hanging suspense were Lyonel Feininger in his Kin-der-Kids for the Chi-
cago Tribune in 1906, Winsor McCay in Little Nemo
in Slumberlaml for the New
York Herald in 1905, and Charles W. Kahles in Hairbreadth Harry for the Philadel-
phia Press in 1906.
Weekday comic strips in black and white were initiated in the Hearst morning and
afternoon papers across the country in the early 1900s. At first, these were miniatur-
ized versions of the Sunday comic strips, self-contained gags about reappearing char-
acters for whom the strips were named.
( Some
early examples were Cus Mager's
Knocko the Monk, H. A. McCill's Padlock Bones, the Dead Sure Detective, and F.
M. Howarth's Mr. E. Z. Mark. ) Some might appear for as many as ten successive
weekdays, but that was accidental; the average frequency was three days a week, and
the editorial purpose was to provide daily variety in strips, not daily duplication of the
same features.
In 1907, however, Henry Conway "Bud" Fisher, sports-page cartoonist for the San
Francisco Chronicle, introduced a seven-day-a-week sports-page comic strip called A.
Mutt, which gave the reader daily, tongue-in-cheek horse-racing
tips. Mr. Mutt suf-
fered or prospered according to the next-day outcome of these tips.
Fisher had, in fact, gotten his idea for the Chronicle feature from an earlier but ill-
fated try for a similar strip created by Clare Briggs and Moses Koenigsberg for the
Hearst Chicago
papers,
the American and Examiner. Called A.
Piker Clerk, the
Briggs-drawn sports-page strip, primarily an y\merican feature, was intended for daily
pubhcation, but was late
for many of the
paper's
several
daily
editions and was
crowded out of others by late sports news. Finally given the coup de disgrace by
Hearst—who found Briggs's twitting of foreign dignitaries
(i.e., the Czar of Russia)
in the strip vulgar—A. Piker Clerk remains a vital
if premature experiment in devel-
oping a daily comic strip.
Fisher's A. Mutt (later Mutt and Jeff)
literally became an overnight sensation
in
San Francisco and materially increased the daily circulation of the Chronicle. The
paper's bitter local rival, the Hearst Examiner, sensed a good thing in the strip and
promptly hired Fisher away from the Chronicle at a hefty boost in salary. The local
delight with Fisher's daily episode continued, and the impressed Hearst wasted no
time in moving Fisher to New York and syndicating A. Mutt nationally. An aroused
public's interest in daily character strips with strong thematic narrative was nurtured
by a myriad of other six- and seven-day-a-week strips which quickU' followed on the
sports pages of papers everywhere, including Sidney Smith's Buck Nix in the Chicago
American, Russ Westover's Luke McGluck in the San Francisco Post, C. M. Payne's
Honeybunch's Hubby in the New York World, and George Herriman's Baron Mooch
in the Los Angeles Examiner.
On January 31, 1912, Hearst introduced the nation's
first full daily comic page in
his New York Evening Journal, adding it to his other afternoon papers from coast to
15

m
coast a few days later. Initially made up of four large daily strips, including Herri-
man's Family
Upstairs and Harry Hershfield's Desperate Desmond
(a continuing
cliff-hanger ) , the Hearst page expanded to five, then sLx, and finall>' nine daily strips
through the teens and early twenties. Other papers emulated the Hearst example, and
by the 1920s the phenomenon was to be found in hundreds of newspapers around the
coimtry, fed by dozens of daily strips distributed by a multitude of small syndicates.
From these early small svudicates emerged the giants of the thirties, such as Hearst's
King Features, Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA), the Chicago Tribune-
New York News Syndicate, the Associated Press, and United Features from United
Press.
By the 1930s, comic strips by the daily pageful and Sunday color section collections
were to be found in most American and Canadian newspapers. Vital to the then wide-
spread urban and rural competition between newspapers, the comic strip was given
increasing space and prominence, with editors vying for the newest, strongest, and
most original. As a result, the comic strip was to be seen at its most varied, inventive,
colorful, and exciting plent>' in the thirties and early forties—a peak of creativity and
popularity it has not held since.
As an introductory collection, our volume has
( and must have )
its limitations. Eight
strips are presented here in extensive continuity' with complete narrative sequence,
but perhaps as many as thirty deserve that kind of representation. Moreover, a num-
ber of fine strips have been crowded out of even the group of single-episode examples
to which a large body of the included strips have been limited. But in order to estab-
lish a functional basis for the selection of representative material, the editors had to
set a few general rules of procedure.
First, we drew up two lists of comics. One of them contained the editors' choices of
the most accomplished and critically memorable
strips, considered both as graphic
and narrative works. The other set forth the most generally famed, popular, and typical
strips. Thus The Kin-der-Kids, Mr. Twee Deedle, and School Days would be on the
first
list, but not the second; while Tillie the Toiler and Joe Palooka would be obvi-
ous choices
for the second. A number of strips, of com-se, appeared on both
lists
(tides such as Polly and Her Pals, Thimble Theatre, Katzenjammer Kids, Dick Tracy,
and Mickey Mouse), and clearly these were strong contenders
for relatively exten-
sive representation in the collection. The bulk of our volume is built around examples
of those works which combine intrinsic excellence and wide popularity with readers
of their time, while titles relegated to just one list or the other were included as space
and the need
for reasonable representation of both bodies of material seemed
to
dictate.
We
also took into account those
strips which have recently been so widely re-
printed to meet the demands of their still-active aficionados that inclusion
at length
in these pages might be considered wasteful of valuable space—such strips as Flash
Gordon, Buck Rogers, Tarzan, and Prince Valiant. Dick Tracy
is included in a fairly
long excerpt because of the nearly exclusive focus on the post- 1940 strip in current
reprints. Our selection is from the mid-thirties, when Chester Gould's work was rather
different in quality and tone.
Ultimately, of course, what the editors have done in this collection
is make their
own choices out of their own knowledge and their own tastes. We may disagree as to
whether every
strip or every continuity herein
is
art or even
artistic. We do not
claim that the volume at hand is a "definitive" comics collection (whatever that would
be). We have put together a selection of comics we feel are interesting, important,
representative, funny, curious, exceptional, artistic—and the reader, of course, will
take his choice from among those descriptions.
Further comments on the selections wdll be found in brief prefaces to each of the
several period divisions of the book. Extensive discussion of all the material
in
this
collection will be found in coeditor Bill Blackbeard's forthcoming book The Endless
Art: The Literature of the Cotnic Strip (Oxford University Press).

On the matter of authorship', we make no effort to disentangle some knotty prob-
lems of strip history. A successful strip illustrator-author might hire an assistant to
help draw, an assistant to help plot, or both, at one or more periods of his career—or,
in some cases, an outright ghost or ghosts to take over for a while. Yet he
still might
retain an artistic control over his creation. (Or he might not. Indeed, the trade gossip
has long held that the "author" of one of the most successful
strips
of the
1930s
and 1940s never drew the feature at all, even in the beginning, and probably that gos-
sip tells the truth. However, such matters are properly the province of other scholar-
ship and other books.)
The pages
that follow have
their share of stereotypes and some of those stereo-
types are racial. Comedy and melodrama are always based on the manipulation of
stereotypes of some kind, although in such contexts we usually call them "stock char-
acters" or "traditional types" or some such. What remains for the true artist, of course,
is to bring his types to life and relate them to reality.
There is a distinction between a simply careless or insensitive or even racist exploi-
tation of national and racial types on the one hand and a quite legitimate satire or
burlesque on the other. But such distinctions are sometimes
difficult
to make, and
American artists have not always made them.
The distinctions are important, to be sure. And you will find in these pages exam-
ples of both unthinking racial exploitation and, occasionally, true satirical observa-
tion. In the popular culture of this country, we are dealing with an art to which, until
fairly recently, nothing and nobody was sacred. And in which a guileless Irish bum
( Happy Hooligan ) , a confused black janitor, or a mysterious Oriental could be made
the subject or the butt of humor or of melodrama,
fairly or unfairly, without any
hesitation.
At the same time, we are also sometimes the victims of our passing attitudes. Thus
in the 1970s we are apt to find the conman Kingfish
( although he was portrayed on
television by a
skillful black comedian, Tim Moore) disquieting. But we find Redd
Foxx's Fred Sanford of "Sanford and Son" comfortably amusing. And we acclaim
Richard Pryor's satiric array of scatological black street characters as examples of bold
and insightful theatrical art.
Collective attitudes change. Perhaps popular insight changes as well. But comedy
and drama both remain, and so, therefore, do the basic types that are a part of their
substance.
In any case, as presented here they are a part of our history, a part which it would
be pointless for us to attempt to suppress.
The question of content and meaning in these strips is one we do not intend to pur-
sue further in this introduction. But
it
is a question quite worth pursuing, and one
that would encompass
collective and
archetypical
ritual;
theatrical,
literary, and
graphic tradition; and contemporary social attitudes, conscious and unconscious.
It would involve the individual strip author's intentions as well. Harold Gray's Lit-
tle Orphan Annie clearly invites us to admire the sizable empire-and-fortune-build-
ing prowess of Daddy Warbucks on the one hand, and the thrifty and loyal virtues
the author sees as encouraged by day-to-day poverty on the other. Similarly, Dick
Tracy was frankly conceived by Chester Gould as a policeman who would save us
from rampant 1930s gangsterism by shooting first and asking questions afterwards.
As indicated, much of the text of this volume represents the collaborative effort of both
editors. As a result, the stylistic habits of each writer have been set aside to produce a
harmoniously unobtrusive body of infonnation to accompany the much more important
graphic content of the book. Such opinions and historical interpretations as are set
forth indicate only that one or the other of us held them; not necessarily both.
The current material in Section Eight, included to augment the general appeal of
17

the collection and necessarUy limited
in scope through space considerations, was
chosen mainly for its stylistic or thematic relation to the older and earlier material in
the book and does not represent, by any means, all of the current titles either or both
of us would like to have included.
By collecting and juxtaposing our strips as we have here, we do them some admit-
ted injustice. The narratives of Segar, Kelly, and the rest are, after
all, intended to
be read in daily episodes, and each such fragment of narrative has its own rise and fall
and an
implicit suspense
that
is supposed
to be
relieved
(and then continued)
twenty-four hours later with the arrival of the next day's paper. But we have placed
the next day's episode further down the page.
Read them with that in mind.
And enjoy.

Folklore Figures in the
Early Sunday Comic Strip,
1896-1916
During its first two decades the new comic-strip medium appeared chiefly on large,
pulp paper pages in color-printed Sunday humor and magazine sections of the more
prosperous metropolitan newspapers.
( Tabloid-size color comic pages
first appeared
when the Chicago Tribune, Portland Oregonian, and other papers introduced them
as a paper-saving measure
in 1918.) Three comic figures of popular fiction domi-
nated virtually to the exclusion of all others: the demon child, the clownish innocent,
and the humanized animal.
And the demon child led all the rest. The character also appeared, in varying de-
grees of rascality, throughout American fiction at the time the first strips were being
conceived, notably with such hellions as Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn, George W.
Peck's Bad Boy, and Edward W. Townsend's Chimmie Fadden. However, he was
perhaps even more luridly and seminally rendered in such
earlier German popular
graphic figures as Heinrich Hoffmann's Struwwelpeter
( 1845; but anticipated by a fig-
ure in Paul Gavami's illustrations for Les enfants
terribles of 1843) and Wilhelm
Busch's Max and Moritz (1865).
The premier figure of juvenile genius and subversion in the comics was, of course,
R. F. Outcault's Yellow Kid. He was almost immediately followed by Rudolph Dirks's
longer-lasting Katzenjammer Kids team of Hans and Fritz, which had originally been
copied directly from the two schrecklichkinder of Busch. Subsequent demon children
of the early Sunday comics were Outcault's Buster Brown, Winsor McCay's
Little
Samwy Sneeze, Nemo's troublesome buddies in Little Nemo in Slwnherland, George
McManus's Nibsy (hero of a short-lived spoof on McCay's Nemo page, Nibsy the
Newsboy in Funny Fairyland), James Swinnerton's Jimmy, Penny Ross's Esther
(in
Mama's Angel Child), Tad Dorgan's Johnny Wise, George Herriman's Bud Smith.
C. W. Kahles's Bobby Bounce
( continuing in the strip briefly done in 1902 by W. W.
Denslow, illustrator of The Wizmd of Oz, as Billy Bounce), A. C. Fera's Elmer (in
19

Just Boy), Walter Hoban's
Jerry, Tom McNamara's
city gang
in Us
Kids, Clare
Dwiggins's rural kids in School Days—and many others.
Almost as common on the early Sunday comic page was the well-meaning, even
saindy, fool, who ranged in nineteenth-century literature from Dickens's Mr. Toots
in Dotnbey and Son to Dostoevski's Prince Mishkin of The Idiot, but who was per-
haps most popularly rendered in the sad clown hero of Leoncavallo's later nineteenth-
century opera, / Pagliacci. Initially introduced to the comic strip in Fred Opper's 1900
Sunday page, Happy Hooligan, drawn for Hearst's New York Journal, clownish inno-
cents promptly swarmed across
the color
strips in the guise of such characters as
Raymond Ewer's Slim Jim, Billy Marriner's Sambo, Norman R. Jennette's Marseleen
(a clown in full Pagliaccian regaha), George McManus's Lovey and Dovey (in The
Newlyweds), C. M. Payne's Pop (in S'Matter Pop?), Rube Goldberg's Boob McNutt,
Winsor McCay's Little Nemo, James Swinnerton's Sam
(in Sam and His Laugh),
George
Herriman's
Major
Ozone,
Charles
Schultz's
Fo.xy
Grandpa,
and many
another.
Not quite as widespread in the early Sunday comics as the two types cited, but a
close third in popular usage and appeal, was the humanized animal, found in
chil-
dren's tales and cautionary parables as far back as Aesop, most memorably captured
as a prototypical image in Charles Perrault's cocky and adventurous Puss in Boots, and
abundantly present in nineteenth-century fiction, notably in Hans Christian Ander-
sen's Fairy Tales, the monumental Scenes in the Private atui Public Lives of Animals
by Grandville
(J. L L Gerard), and Joel Chandler Harris's Uncle Remus series. In
the new narrative art of the comic strip, the humanized animal was first introduced by
James Swinnerton
in the figure of his philandering Mr. Jack, an
initially unnamed
feline character who first began to emerge as a distinct individual in 1902 in Swinner-
ton's popularly named Little Tigers feature.
( Earlier Swinnerton cartoon work fea-
turing anthropomorphized animals, such as his Little Bears and Tykes panel of 1893,
and his On and Off the Ark of circa 1900 and later, did not qualify as definitive comic
strips, because of the lack of dialogue balloons and/or individualized and regularly
recurrent characters.
)
At about the time of Swinnerton's creation of the nattily dressed and highly hu-
manized Mr. Jack, R. F. Outcault, in 1902, was putting salty and sarcastic ripostes in
the mouth of Buster Brown's bulldog, Tige, and casually granting speech to other
animals in the strip. By 1904 Fred Opper had introduced the demonic, high-kicking
Maud the Mule into his cast of comic-page characters—but by then, humanized ani-
mals were becoming commonplace
in the comics. Among others prominent
at the
time were Charles Twelvetrees's Johnny Quack and
the Van Cluck Twins, Gus
Mager's Jungle Folks, the Animal Friends of Walt MacDougall's Hank, J. M. Conde's
Uncle Remus characters (Br'er Rabbit et al. in Uncle Remus Stories), the fantastic
animals
in Harry Grant Dart's The Explorigator and Bob Dean's Swots. Sherlock
Bones in Lyonel Feininger's The Kin-der-Kids, Sidney Smith's Old Doc Yak, George
Herriman's later Krazy Kat (made a Sunday-page figure by 1916), C. M. Payne's
Bear Creek Folks, and R. K. Culver's Roosevelt Bears.
Several of these humanized animal features were not true comic strips; rather, like
the currently published Prince Valiant, they were
lavi.shly
illustrated prose
fiction,
without balloons or linking panels of action, but their frequency in comic sections of
the time and their emphasis on animals speaking intelligently call
for their mention
here, if not their inclusion in the body of this anthology itself.
Virtually ignored in the Sunday comic pages of these early years was the serious
male hero
figure,
fiercely active
in
the popular
fiction of the
time, from Sherlock
Holmes to Tarzan. When present at all, he was treated as a butt of .satire, notably in F.
M. Howarth's Old Opie Dilldock, H. A.
Mc-CJill's daily Hairbreadth Harold in Hearst's
New York Journal, and C. W. Kahles's syndicated Hairbreadth Harry.
Women, considered
a.s sympathetic heroines, received
little concern
until Gene
Carr's Lady Bountiful appeared as a Sunday page in early 1920, although a few ear-
20

lier, illustrated-story pages, like Wallace Morgan's Fluffy Ruffles, ran in newspapers'
Sunday magazine sections, rather than with the comics. Seriously suspenseful narra-
tive continuity, too, was simply nonexistent in these two initial decades between 1896
and 1916, when slapstick humor was the bell-capped, starry-kicked king.
Notes on strips in this section
The
strip numbers,
in
brackets,
accompany
individual comments
as an aid to easy reference.
That's the anticipatory grinning face of George B. Luks looking down on R. F. Out-
cault's Hogan's Alley characters in the opening selection
[I]: Luks was
to take the
World feature over from Outcault for Hearst's Journal when the
latter
left,
after
drawing this final page.
Johnny Wise [2] was a very early page from Tad Dorgan, a cartoonist chiefly noted
for his later, daily sports-page strips. It appeared only in the San Francisco Chronicle.
The Little Nemo in Slumberland episodes
[11-14] were selected from McCay's
first version of the strip, which ran in the New York Herald between 1905 and 1911.
(Two subsequent versions ran
in other papers. The
first appeared
in
the Hearst
papers between 1911 and 1914, and the second in the New York Herald Tribune be-
tween 1924 and 1927. Examples of pages from these two later versions will be found
in the third section of this book.
)
The appearance of Lyonel Feininger's remarkable Kin^der-Kids
[16-18] page
in
the Chicago Tribune in 1906 marked the first occasion of a regularly appearing comic
strip being drawn and imported from abroad; in this instance, from Germany. Edito-
rial difficulties arising from this procedure led to the strip's demise in less than a year.
Johnny Gruelle, creator of the charming fairyland fantasy Mr. Twee Deedle [20],
later, of course, wrote the Raggedy Ann book series.
C. M. Payne's Bear Creek Folks [24-25] was derived in part from Albert Bigelow
Paine's Hollow Tree book series with their striking
J. M. Conde
illustrations, and
more remotely from Joel Chandler Harris's Uncle Remus stories, but it often reads like
an anticipation of Walt Kelly's later Pogo.
Clare Victor Dwiggins's School Days
[26-27]
is notable
(aside from
its
art and
wacky humor) as having been the first strip to feature the screwball devices or "in-
ventions," with which Rube Goldberg later became identified.
The Mutt and Jeff Sunday pages reproduced here were among the
first to be re-
leased in color, but they are typical of the earlier Sunday black and white pages pub-
lished in the Hearst press circa 1911-1913, and reflect the inspired slapstick qualities
which made Bud Fisher's team one of the great strip hits of all time. [28-29]
Gus Mager's Hawkshaw the Detective [31] was the Sunday-page continuation of
his earlier daily strip, Sherlocko the Monk. Originally supposed
to be called Sher-
locko the Detective, the Sunday page was retitled Hawksliaw
( borrowing the name
of the detective once famed in Tom Taylor's melodramatic play of 1863, The Ticket-
of-Leave Man)—with the name of Sherlocko's associate, Watso, changed to the Col-
onel—because of threatened suit by A. Conan Doyle's American representatives for
titular infringement of Doyle's Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson characters.

Popular Images in the
Early Daily Comic Strip,
1907-1927
Comic strips in their definitive form did not appear in weekday newspapers until the
turn of the century, when the Hearst daihes began to feature recurrent cartoon char-
acters in black and white, multipanel gag sequences. Some were in an illustrated text
format, but most were in true comic strip style of four to six panels per sequence. At
first they were drawn by Hearst staflF cartoonists in New York and mailed to the other
papers;
later, some were created
locally. None, however, appeared regularly every
day, Monday through Saturday, until Bud Fisher began his A. Mutt strip in 1907.
These early and irregular Hearst weekday strips, a group of which are reproduced
on the
first page of this section, were aimed more at adult readers than were most of
the early Sunday comics, and their characters and attitudes were therefore different
from those of the weekend color pages. This relatively sophisticated orientation was
retained for the daily strip as its use spread among newspapers and the strips added
three additional figures of popular lore—the henpecked father, the omniscient detec-
tive, and the luckless, therefore lovable, scalawag.
Married figures had already appeared in the color strips, of course, but virtually all
of these
fell into the innocent fool category {The
Netchjweds,
Their Only
Child,
S'Matter Pop? and so forth), while the prototypical image of the henpecked husband
(with its countervailing image of the domineering wife), which was to be so widely
utilized
in
the early weekday
strips, appeared only indirectly in the early Sunday
pages,
in
the form
of the rolling-pin-belabored Captain
in
Dirks's Katzenjammer
Kids, who was not married to the Kids' often irate mother, but was her star boarder.
The classic figure of the wife-beset, but cynically struggling, husband was portrayed
often and well by Dickens, particularly in his rendition of the paterfamilial worm in
Mr. Snagsby of Bleak House and the foredoomed Captain Cuttle of Domhetj and Son,
but he was perhaps most memorably set forth in popular nineteenth-century fiction
51

as Douglas Jerrold's vocalK' berated hero of Mrs. Caudle's Curtain Lectures in 1865.
He appeared notably for the first time in strips as Gus Mager's Henpecko the Monk,
in the weekday strip of the same name, circa 1908. Two years later, George Herriman
introduced E. Pluribus Dingbat in his Dingbat Family, followed in the strips by a
number of similarly browbeaten breadwinners.
George McManus combined the hapless husband image with that of the socially
rising family
(a theme long treated
satirically in popular American
literature and
drama)
in
his daily Bringing Up Father
strip
of 1914 in the Hearst papers. Mc-
Manus's Jiggs was an Irish bricklayer-become-millionaire, Maggie was an ambitious
virago of a wife, and after their appearance, henpecker\' became a stock subject in
the
daily
strips
( broadening
later
into
the Sunday
pages )
:
Sidney
Smith's The
Gumps, Billy De Beck's Barney Google, Gene Ahem's Our Boarding House, Harry
Tuthill's Home, Sweet Home
(later The Bungle Family), A. D. Condo's The Out-
bursts of Everett True, Cliff Sterrett's Polly and Her Pals, Bud Fisher's Mutt and Jeff,
W. R. Allman's Doings of the Duffs, and many more.
The
all -perceptive detective, a mythic figure essentially developed in nineteenth-
century fiction and drama
(the term
itself only dates from
1843, when
Sir James
Graham, British Home Secretary', coined it in forming his "Detecti%'e Police," a body
made up of the most intelligent London police officers of the time), was first effectively
introduced to popular hterature as a figure of detached, analytical intellect in Edgar
Allan Foe's C. Auguste Dupin of "The Murders in the Rue Morgue
"
( 1841 ) and as an
image of dogged strength and hard-boiled professionalism
in Charles Dickens's In-
spector Bucket of Bleak House
( 1853 )
. But
it was A. Conan Doyle who,
in his A
Study In Scarlet of 1887, combined brain with cold professionalism and strong per-
sonality in a classic version of the fictional sleuth Sherlock Holmes. The Holmes con-
cept spread like paper-fed
fire through popular literature during the following de-
cades and reached the comic strip
in a short-lived Hearst weekday spoof of 1904
called Padlock Bones, by H. A. McGill.
Burlesques of Holmes followed in other strips, both daily and Sunday, but the de-
tective's most famous early
strip avatar was Gus Mager's weekday Sherlocko
the
Monk, who first appeared in the strip of that name in Hearst's New York Journal for
December 9, 1910, later to become even better known as Hawkshaw the Detective.
The Holmes character was burlesqued further in Sidney Smith's early Sunday Sher-
lock Holmes, Jr. for the Chicago Tribune, and as a comic figure in such established
strips as Dirks's Katzenjamtner Kids, which
featured an Eskimo
detective named
Sherlock Gunk, and Segar's in Thimble Theatre, which involved a Gimlet the Detec-
tive and a Shamrock Jones in its daily continuity. More generalized detective figures
appeared
elsewhere,
as
in Harry
Hershfield's weekday
Dauntless Durham
of
the
U. S. A. and Sidney Smith's daily Buck Nix.
The third and perhaps most widespread new figure in the daily comic strip was
the inept but charming rogue. He had long been a figure
in popular literature, of
course, notably as Falstaff, or
( more recently )
as Dickens's Seth Pecksniff in Martin
Chuzzlewit, or Mark Twain's King and the Duke in Huckleberry Finn, or in the more
heroically presented Tom and Jerry of Pierce Egan's Life in London and Sut Lovin-
good of George W. Harris's American fables. This image had appeared in the early
Sunday pages, but almost always as either a subsidiary character
(i.e., Long John
Silver in Dirks's Katzenjammer Kids, or Rudolph Rassendale in Kahles's Hairbreadth
Harry), or as one or more
titular figures whose roguery was implicit, in dress and
manner, rather than expUct in behavior
(i.e., Alphonse and Gaston, in Opper's strip
of that name, or Tom and Jerry in Rube Goldberg's early The Look-a-Like Boys).
The one notable exception was Svvinnerton's married flirt in Mr. Jack
( whose weekly
strip behavior
in pages read by children upset many readers and led
to the
strip's
being relegated to infrequent daily appearance in the safe, smoking-room atmosphere
of the sports and editorial pages after 1904). But in the daily strips, with their essen-
tially adult audience at the time, scurvy vagal)()ndage prospered.
Artless Dodgers
52

were memorable in such early daily strips as Bud Fisher's Mutt and Jeff. Clare Briggs's
A.
Piker
Clerk, Gus
Mager's
various
conniving Monks
(excepting
Sherlocko,
of
course), George Herriman's Baron Bean, Dok Hager's Dippy Duck, Sidney Smith's
Buck Nix and Old Doc Yak, Billy De Beck's Barney Google, Frank Willard's Moon
MuUins, E. C. Segar's Thimble Theatre, Harry Hershfield's Desperate Desmond and
Abie the Agent, and many, many more.
The order of the day in daily strips between 1907 and 1927 was satire, cheerful cyn-
icism, and subdued slapstick, centered on helpless husbands, burlesque
detectives,
and inept scoundrels. But new kinds of strips and heroes did enter the scene in the
1920s and shape the character of all strips in the following decade.
For instance, the image of the self-reliant
working
girl
in
an
office
background
enjoyed its most extensive use in the daily strips, and developed in the 1920s in such
strips as
Tillie the Toiler and Somebody's Stenog;
it was not a part of the group of
prototypical figures which shaped much of the content of the initial daily strip work.
Notes on strips in this section
Gus Mager's Monk strips [34, 36] ran initially under a number of alternative tides,
reflecting the name of the character featured in a given episode: Tightwaddo the
Monk. Knocko the Monk, Nervo the Monk, and so on. Their popularity inspired the
stage names given to four of the Marx Brothers during a poker game, and the team
used them during the rest of their career.
The Desperate Desmond [37] strip was named for
its top-hatted villain protago-
nist; the opposing hero was named Claude Eclair, and the heroine Fair Rosamond.
The prose narrative under each panel was auxiliary rather than explanatory, making
the feature an odd combination of illustrated fiction and comic strip.
Midsummer Day Dreams
[40],
the Winsor McCay work,
is
typical
of a
large
number of daily graphic anecdotes he drew at this time. Few,
if any, involved re-
peated characters, and no comic strip developed out of them.
The A. Mutt episodes included here [41-46] ran only in the San Francisco Exam-
iner of the time (Bud Fisher having been hired away from the Chronicle by that
paper in 1907 ) and involve the first appearance of Mutt's later partner, Jeff. The cas-
ual comic use of a lunatic asylum as the setting is typical of the irreverent, freewheel-
ing content of the early daily strips.
The Family Upstairs [48-53], first named The Dingbat Family, and later given that
name again, carried the earliest exploits of Herriman's Krazy Kat krew, at first around
the feet of the human cast of the strip, and then in a separate row of panels below
them. The "family upstairs" of the
title refers to a mysterious menage living in the
apartment above that of the Dingbats, none of whose members are ever seen in the
strip, and whose weird
doings
drive
the
Dingbats
to
a
frenzy
of
curiosity and
animosity.
Baron Bean [54-77] featured a pretentious, ragtag bum of similar mien to Dicken's
Montague Tigg/Tigg Montague of Martin Chtizzlewit, who was often at fanciful war
with his strangely loyal manservant. Grimes.
Stumble Inn [78-83] was an extraordinarily lavish daily strip of the dimensions in-
dicated in the selections here. Short-lived as a daily,
it ran for several years as a Sun-
day page and exhibited Herriman's fancy in a somewhat more restrained context than
usual.
Dok's Dippy Duck [84-91] was the strip-in-residence of the Seattle Times, appear-
ing only in that paper and running seven days a week, either on the front page or just
inside. The resemblance of the cocky Dippy to the later Disney Donald Duck is self-
evident, reflecting a common human perception of the nature of ducks.
Buck Nix [92-95]
first appeared as a strip outgrowth of the sidelines master of cer-
emonies to Sidney Smith's Chicago American sports-page cartoons, which displayed
Smith's comic genius
as an absorbing
storyteller. An audience
quickly developed
which preferred Buck Nix to more formal sports art. Hired away by the Chicago Tri-
53

bune. Smith continued Buck as Old Doc Yak [103-107], first as a Sunday page, then
briefly as a daily in order to introduce Smith's new strip concept. The Gumps [96-
102].
The second group of Bud Fisher episodes selected are a random potpourri of Muti
and Jeff [108-125] from its best period in the late 1920s and earl\- 1930s.
The reader will note the descriptive phrases and subheads assigned to the early
strips in this section. As strips became more and more popular, and more and more
widely syndicated, the composition and addition of a daily descriptive subhead grad-
ually became the prerogative of the comics editor of each subscribing local paper, not
that of the author or the syndicate's own editor. Accordingly, we have dropped the
subheads from most of the daily episodes which follow in this volume.

The funny paper has
.
.
. become not only a faithful reflection of the tastes and ethical principles
of the country at large;
it
is also manifestly an extremely powerful organ of social satire.
The
daily block of cinema-squares
is the medium through which the vices of man are held up for all to
see ....
The few cardinal virtues that we sometimes venture apologetically to
call our own are dis-
regarded by the funnies as comparatively uninteresting to the non- church-goer,
and as
'old stuff
to
the veteran of the Sunday-school bench or the straight-backed pew.
All of them,
it
is true,
draw
largely on contemporary mainners for their subject matter,
but the genuine masterpieces of the art use
these merely as machinery for the display of the essential Satan,
the unquenchable
'Peck's Bad Boy,'
in all of us.

I have that fallacious feeling of absolute knowledge that a first edition of Theodore Dreiser will
have only the value of its covers for a quaint period chocolate box
in 2000 A.D.,
whereas the
single copy known of three famous comic strips,
say
'Mutt and Jeff,'
'Andy Gump,'
and
'Krazy Kat,'
complete from their beginnings,
cut
out and pasted
in endless oilcloth- covered volumes by an invalid
spinster of the epoch on an isolated fann,
will have something like the value of the original manu-
script,
say,
of the Book of the Dead.

Old Cunning Stagers
Long-Lived Stars of the
Comic Strip's Second Two Decades
1916-1936
This section of Sunday pages
is devoted to famous and long-surviving characters
brought to hfe in the multitude of comic strips which packed the color comic sections
of the 1920s and early 1930s.
That was the period in which weekend comic sections went from four to eight and
then to sixteen pages, with the Hearst papers initiating a fantastic thirty-two-page
tabloid section in 1935. And that encouraged the proliferation of new strips from the
dozen or more syndicates which were by then supplying an
insatiable newspaper
market. The old and established strips seemed to retain their earlier places through
the floodtide of new
titles, and a few of the new strips (Moon MuUins and others)
displayed the qualities necessary to match the audiences for the classic works, and to
continue through the subsequent decades with them. We have included a short-lived
but very typical new strip of the period, The Smythes.
This was also the last great period of full Sunda\' pages for each and ever\' strip. In
the 1940s half pages and even one-third pages for major strips gradually became a
common and accepted thing. The galaxy of the comic strip never again was to glow
so brightly as during these last marvelous years of its springtide.
Notes on strips in this section
The Smythes [126-127] represents one of the few occasions
(but not the only)
in
which one of the circle of Neic Yorker magazine panel cartoonists ventured into the
comic strip. Rea Irvin, the strip's creator, did these Sunday pages for the New York
Herald Tribune, whose comic section was marked by a special sophistication and
restraint.
The Gumps pages included [128-129] are typical of this immensely popular strip
of the 1920s, whose saucy familial banter and obsession with cars suited the pubhc's
fancy. The "Old 348," Andy Gump's large-licensed auto, was inherited by him from
Sidney Smith's previous Sunday-page hero. Old Doc Yak.
Cliff Sterrett was, after George Herriman, the unbridled and unflagging graphic
master of the comic Sunday page. In fact, Sterrett took his popular strip of family life
so far from formal graphic reality that his syndicate became alarmed and ordered him
to restore some measure of comprehensive nonnality before his readership abandoned
him in the same perplexity with which they reacted to Herriman's Krazy Kat. The
79

pages of Polly and Her Pals reproduced here only suggest the extent of Sterrett's bril-
hant graphic work in the late 1920s [130-135].
These later Moon Mullins Sunday pages [138-139] are concerned with the first ap-
pearance in the strip of Moon's earthy Uncle Willie, an event roughly similar to the
first tentative introduction of Mrs. Gamp into Dickens's Martin Chuzzlewit.
This second group of McCay's Nemo pages [140-142] combines examples from the
strip's second Hearst period (the first two selections of 1912) and
its third and final
period with the Herald Tribune
( the last selection of 1925 )
. As can be seen, McCay's
imagination did not
flag, although his graphic verve was hampered by the Herald
Tribune's policy of a standard twelve-panel format for most of his later work.
The unforgettable images of C. W. Kahles's delightful cast of melodramatic char-
acters are showoi to advantage in this example of Hairbreadth Harry
[143] from
Kahles's last decade as a cartoonist.
In the mastery of strip graphics, few cartoonists have equaled George McManus,
as these two selections of his Bringing Up Father will demonstrate
[144-145]. The
humor he sustained over the years in developing the familial conflict between Jiggs
and Maggie is also well evidenced.
Included here are the Katzenjammer Kids pages of Harold H. Knerr [146-148],
drawn for the Hearst papers from the mid-1910s on, after Rudolph Dirks left Hearst
to continue his strip elsewhere, and now called The Captain and the Kids. Both Dirks
and Knerr have their partisans, but they were both ingenious in handling the Katzen-
jammer menage.
Barney Google [149-150], the rogue and vagabond strip ne plus ultra, along with
Frank Willard's equally perceptive Moon Mullins [138-139], caught the raffish, des-
perate, yet raucously colorful quality of lower-class, pool-hall-and-race-track life of
the twenties. Billy De Beck even extended the scope of his strip to the expatriate Paris
of Hemingway and Fitzgerald, as will be noted in one of the selections included here.
De Beck's later turn to backwoods hillbilly life with the introduction of Snuffy Smith
in the early
thirties probably resulted from
his own
distaste
for
the grim decade
which replaced the roisterous twenties, and his attempt to find an idyllic world to re-
place it.
Frank King had a highly fanciful way with his Sunday-page work which
is often
overlooked
in discussions of his cradle-to-maturity family saga, Casoline Alley, fea-
turing Uncle Walt and Skeezix. Here we have reproduced some of King's finest pages
[151-156],
including one which mildly parodies German expressionism, one which
brings the look of woodcuts to the comic strip, and others which startlingly follow
the twelve-panel progress of the characters across a full-page
field of static back-
ground.
Rube Goldberg's Booh McNutt [157-158] was one of the few major narrative and
suspense strips which never appeared in a daily format, running from start to finish as
a Sunday page only. The two examples shown here are from the strip's earlier, anec-
dotal phase.
Merely Margy [161] was the comic strip of John Held,
Jr., renowned
artist
for
College Humor and other youthfully oriented publications of the period. Like most of
Held's popular work, Margy reflected the view of college and "flapper" life held by
most collegiate youths of the time, from coonskin coats to hip flasks.
Somebody's Stenog
[ 162] was a Sunday page of fine graphic verve, a point which
has sadly been lost because of the feature's later reputation as a kind of second-string
Tillie the Toiler.
Harry Tuthill was the Louis-Ferdinand Celine of the comic page, and his bleakly
jaundiced view of lower-middle-class family life
( happily offset by a wild sense of
humor and a fancy which filled the later strips with gnomes, enchanted mice,
fairies,
magicians, and time-travel )
is well reflected in the group of early 1930s Bungle Family
pages reprinted here
[ 163-169].
George Herriman's Krazy Kat, the apogee of comic-strip art and narrative to date,
puzzled so much of the readership of its time that many Hearst chain editors pub-
80

lished the Sunday pages only under direct orders from Hearst himself, who recog-
nized and appreciated Herriman's fey genius. However, Hearst had
it printed in the
weekly drama and arts section of his papers, where it had to run in black and white,
rather than in the full panoply of color which Herriman could put to the stunning use
demonstrated in Section Seven of this collection. Virtually all of Herriman's Sunday-
page work between 1916 and 1934 accordingly ran in black and white (except for a
brief group of pages published in the New Yor^ Journal in 1922) and the preponder-
ance is reflected in the selection reproduced here [170-172].
The Blondie page is typical of the early strips [173].
Our Skippy selection demonstrates Percy Crosby's early unfettered strip humor
and mobile line [174].

Sunny Toonerville
and the Darkling World
Anecdote and Narrative
in the Daily Comic Strip,
1917-1933
The reality of death, and the recurrent threat of it, on which adventure and detective
fiction are based, came to the comic strip
in the winter of 1925, quietly, unexpectedly,
and somewhat obscurely. There had been hints earlier: a few men had been brought
low as part of the plot mechanics in the movie satires of Ed Wheelan's Minute Movies
and Chester Gould's Fillum Fables, but only as jests poked at the mayhem of some
silent film melodramas. And a cold-blooded murder
plot, which had been hatched
against Oliver Warbucks in Harold Gray's Orphan Annie in mid-1925, built some
brief suspense but ended farcically, with the plotters booted offstage. Roy Crane's
Wash Tubhs, which had begun in early 1924 and was to become the greatest adven-
ture strip of the 1920s, had not yet moved beyond comic melodrama and village ro-
mance, with an early seafaring treasure hunt handled largely as knockabout farce.
In Phil Hardy, however, a new, short-lived daily strip of late 1925, and in Out Our
Way, an established daily panel anecdote strip with recurring characters and settings
by J. R. Williams, a good deal of realistic blood was often shed in
full view of the
reader. Out Our Way was distributed largely to rural papers and second-string urban
afternoon dailies, so that the impact of realistic death in the comics was somewhat
muted. But the opening note for serious action and adventure had been struck, and
the monopoly of humor on newsprint space began slowly but with an accelerating
pace to yield to suspense and melodrama.
A few established strips moved to suspenseful adventure, notably Crane's Wash
Tuhhs, Gray's Orphan Annie, and Smith's Sunday Gumps. But most of the new em-
phasis came with new, largely daily,
strips such as George Storm's Bohhy Thatcher
(1927), Gus Mager's Oliver's Adventures (1927), Hal
Forrest's
Taihpin Tommy
( 1928), Lyinan Young's Tim Tylers Flying Luck
( 1928), Monte Barrett's Jane Arden
( 1929), Rex Maxon's and Harold Foster's Tarzan
( 1929), and Phil Nowlan's and Dick
Calkins's Buck Rogers (1929). After 1930 came the deluge, permanently altering the
content of the comics pages with crime and adventure strips
Skyroads, Jack
Sicift.
Dick Tracy, Scorchy Smith, Dickie Dare, Patsy Ming Foo,
Little Joe, Dan Dunn,
Donnie, On The Wing, Broncho Bill, Brick Bradford, and others, endless.
131

The major humorous strips held their own, retaining the static shape of yesterday
and the da>^ before, much as
^^
. C.
Fields and Laurel and Hardy brought
their
earlier comic trappings securely and successfully into the sound films of the
thirties.
The daily panels of Toonerville Folks and School Days illuminated the pages of the
daily papers. Moon MuUins and Minute Movies continued to spin irreverent narrative
of a high order. There were as many laughs as ever to be had. The comic strip had
grown and performed an amoebic split into two spheres of appeal, but almost noth-
ing was lost in the act, and a great deal was gained.
Notes on strips in this section
Out Our Way was a curious strip in that it alternated among as many as four separate
anecdotal series, involving four separate sets of characters and settings, devoting one
or two days per week to each continuity [175-178].
Moon MuUins and Barney Google were two of the great daily narrative strips of
the 1920s and 1930s, as the selections included here will attest [221-319],
(Dover
Books has repubUshed two erratically condensed but still delightfully roguish Mullins
narratives from 1929 and 1931 respectively.
)
Another
stor\-
strip of the period, which held readers
for several decades, was
Frank King's Gasoline Alley, but this work, extraordinary as
it was in some ways as a
chronicle of an American family, and unassuming as it was in its stance and tone, does
not excerpt well:
it depends heavily on the reader's intimate knowledge of what has
happened before in the strip, and to whom. The same is true of the daily episodes of
Sidney Smith's The Gumps, which were remarkable in that they gripped millions of
readers with continuity on two disparate levels:
that of a straightforward, bathetic,
and deadly serious melodrama and that of a hilarious and deeph' engaging takeoff on
their own outward content. There
is httle doubt but that Smith, a Rabelaisian and ir-
reverent man of comic wit and imagination, knew what he was doing to his readers
on both levels, and as a greatly gifted storyteller was able simultaneously to satisfy the
expectations of the two groups. But the story line is so complex and extensively de-
veloped that any excerpt of less than eight or nine months would
fail
to be
self-
explanatory as a
unit.
Regrettably,
therefore, the daily Gumps, as well as the daily
Gasoline Alley, have been passed over
in
this
collection. Both surely deserve
ex-
tended, carefully edited, anthologies.
Roy Crane's Wash Tubbs
(published in a companion Sunday page as Captain
Easy)
is reputedly the finest adventiire strip of its time, surpassed only after 1934 by
the work of a man who had self-admittedly been Crane's devoted student:
Milton
Caniff and his Terry and the Pirates. The Wash Tubbs sequence reprinted here
is re-
garded by its devotees as the graphic and narrative apogee of the strip [320-426].

Ihe comic strip, especially after you leave the domestic-
relations type which
is itself realistic
ajid unsentimental,
is
specifically more violent,
more dishonest, more
triclcy and roguish,
than America usually permits
its serious arts to be.
.
.
.
Mutt
and Jiggs and Abie the Agent,
and Barney Google,
and Eddie's
Friends have so little respect for law,
order,
the ri^ts of
property,
the sanctity of money,
the romance of marriage,
and
all the other foundations of Americaji life,
that
if they were put
into
(popular)
fiction the Society for the Suppression of Every-
thing would hale them incontinently to court and our morals would
be saved cigain,

Popeye, the Skipper,
and the Abysses of
Space and Time
Anecdote and Narrative in the
Sunday Comic Strip, 1930-1941
Adventure, crime, and comedy were as mixed in the Sunday comic pages after 1930
as they were in the daily strips, but a new narrative genre, science fiction, entered the
serious comic strip at the turn of the decade. It had already been touched on humor-
ously in such strips as Segar's Thimble Theatre and Kahles's Hairbreadth Harry. With
the daily and Sunday Buck Rogers, the concept of time and space as a realistic, full-
scale playground was transferred from contemporary pulp magazines into the comics,
and almost immediately accepted by the public and by other comic-strip artists and
writers.
An eariy close follower of Buck Rogers was the daily Jack Swift of Cliff Farrell and
Hal Colson (1930). Another daily, Brick Bradford, by William Ritt and Clarence
Gray (1933), followed a litde later. And the celebrated Flash Gordon of Alex Ray-
mond appeared in the Hearst Sunday pages in the first week of 1934. Science fiction
themes also appeared on other and sometimes unlikely narrative strips such as Frank
Godwin's Connie, Harry Tuthill's The Bungle Family, Chester Gould's Dick Tracy,
Norman Marsh's Dan Dunn, Lyman Young's Tim Tyler's Luck, Lee Falk's Mandrake
the Magician and The Phantom, and others. A most successful and well sustained
comic treatment of science was in E. C. Segar's Sunday Sappo, where the brilliantly
cracked Professor O. G. Wottasnozzle came up with continually ingenious and highly
risible inventions.
The great old-timers in the strips continued as before, often untouched by the furor
of action, adventure, and horror on the pages about them. McManus's Maggie and
Jiggs went their bickering and battling way through
the
thirties
as
they had
the
twenties and teens before. The bucolic populace of Toonerville meandered as ever be-
tween the architectural bulk of Aunt Eppie Hogg and the mobile clatter of the Skip-
per's trolley.
New humor strips were introduced, such as Rube Goldberg's Lala Talooza and Ed
Wheelan's Big Top, but there were few real successes in the thirties against the bi-
zarre and exciting competition of the fantastic, criminal, and adventurous
strips,
al-
though Lank Leonard's Mickey Finn and Al Capp's
Li'l Abner survived the era
handily, as did V. T. Hamlin's Alley Oop.

Notes on strips in this section
Dick Calkins drew only the daily Buck Rogers. Despite his signature on the Sunday
pages of the early thirties, Russell Keaton was responsible for the striking artistry of
the two pages which open this section [427-428].
The realistic or illustrative beaux arts style of drawings entered the comic strip
with the advent of realistic adventure, although
it was foreshadowed in the work of
\\'insor McCay. Probably its most effective use was in the work of Alex Ra\inond in
his early (1934-36) Flash Gordon [430]; and in that of Harold Foster in his Tarzan
period (1931-36) [429]. Foster's figures are often particularly notable for their move-
ment and force. Almost universally published at the time in full-page size, with ade-
quate space for the presentation of varying spatial concepts from panel to panel, the
skillfully free-flowing and open style of both artists permitted the full integration of
visually compulsive, multipanel movement and necessary narrative development so
vital to the creation of effective comic-strip color pages.
Subsequent realistic work in the comic-strip vein, additionally hampered by the re-
duced reproductive space available in later years, has tended to be increasingly de-
tailed, with an almost obsessive need
to
fill every part of every panel with black
shadow and complex
linework. Such visual weight can slow down a reader's eye
movement
across
the narrative panels, and even draw
his attention
to
irrelevant
detail.
Like Buck Rogers, Tarzan, Flash Gordon, and Prince Valiant [431] are frequently
reprinted here and abroad, and are
(or soon will be) accessible to collectors in siz-
able editions.
One man who offered a highly fanciful Sunday page was V. T. Hamlin with his
Alley Oop [432-434]. He was also the first major comic-strip artist to take the reader
back into prehistoric time for his narrative setting, thereby reversing the direction of
Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon.
With Cliff Sterrett, George Herriman, and Winsor McCay, Roy Crane was one of
the great technical masters of the Sunday-page layout. In addition to his graphic dex-
terity with page space, Crane told a rattling, tongue-in-cheek adventure
tale, which
made his Sunday Captain Easy [435-437] the equal of his daily Wash Tubbs strip.
Little Joe [438-439], nominally bylined for Ed
Leffingwell, Harold Gray's back-
ground artist for Orphan Annie, was in fact scripted by Gray through the thirties and
early forties, and its characters were drawn by him for a number of years. This little-
known Sunday half page was an entertaining and gripping strip. Replete with a sar-
donic and often bloody humor. Little Joe was a thoroughly adult strip. At the time
it
was relished by a few cognoscenti, but was apparently of
little interest to the gen-
eral public of the thirties, which still thought of western fiction in terms of Zane Grey,
Richard Dix, and Tom Mix, and preferred western strip work of a similar nature.
White Boy [440-441] was another imaginative, nonderivative western strip of the
time, drawn by New Yorker artist Garrett Price in an often stunning graphic style,
and told by him with many skillful touches of the fantastic and unexpected.
It was
caviar to the average reader, had little circulation, and expired in the late thirties.
The extended Thimble Theatre Sunday sequence with which we close this section
is not only the comic and narrative apogee of E. C. Segar's work,
it may be the finest
example of pure comic-strip narration [443-474]. Segar
is almost unknown to any
reader under
fifty who has not encountered the only extensive
reprint
of
his work
since 1940 (the Nostalgia Press Popeye the Sailor collection of 1971). He based his
humor on the interaction of one of the most inspired casts of comic characters this side
of Dickens.
{ The inherent conceptual strength of many of his Thimble Theatre
fig-
ures
is perhaps demonstrated by their continued popularity in the hands of several
successor writers and illustrators since Segar's early death in 1938.) But introductory
words are unnecessary with Segar:
the great sequence awaits only the turn of the
reader's eye to the first episode to speak for itself in the salty, epic speech of Popeye,
the propitiative murmur of J. Wellington Wimpy, or the cursing cackle of the Sea Hag,

Shadow Shapes

Extended Narrative in the
Daily and Sunday Comic Strip,
1928-1943
There
is
little doubt
that a day-to-day
narrative continuity was attractive to the
reading public in the comic strips of the thirties and forties. It was hard to find a sim-
ple anecdotal strip among the daily comics. Such strips as adhered to a daily gag pat-
tern—Carl Anderson's Henry, or the Disney-produced Donald Duck, by Al Talia-
ferro, or J. Millar Watt's English import, Pop—stood out oddly among the multitude
of story strips. Even the humorous strips from the twenties and before, such as Bring-
ing Up Father and The Captain and the Kids, turned in the course of these two de-
cades to story lines with carry-over subsidiary characters.
New daily narrative strips, with the most graphic pretension to realism, included
Ritt's Brick Bradford; Falk's The Phantom and Mandrake the Magician; Briggs's daily
version of Flash Gordon; Young's Tim Tyler's Luck; Forrest's Tailspin Tommy; God-
win's Roy Powers, Eagle Scout; Fanny Cory's Babe Bunting; Zane Grey's King of the
Royal Mounted and Tex Thorne, with their various artists; and a number of others.
Characterizations,
plots, and dialogue tended to be stereot>'ped; the aim of the new
narrative strips was at the audience for boys' adventure stories
( although the leggy
girls who paraded through Mandrake, Flash Gordon, and The Phantom probably
drew some interested glances from adult readers too )
There was a good deal of genuinely inventive, sharply original, and often captiva-
ting narrative, serious and comic, among other daily strips of the period, and a num-
ber of examples have been selected for inclusion in this story-oriented section.
Notes on strips in this section
Alex Raymond's
Secret Agent X-9 of
1934-.35, based in part on scripts by Dashiell
Hammett, reads as freshly and forcefully today as it did at the time it was published.
For a long period in the middle of 1934, when Hammett's script seems to have been
adapted in unadulterated form by Raymond, X-.9 was so superbly executed and nar-
rated that it seems one of the finest achievements of the story strip. The selection here
[475-478] hints at the quality of the whole. Nostalgia Press has published much of
X-.9 for 1934 and 1935 in one volume.
The Abbie an
Slats pages selected here inc-orporate the opening weeks of
this
231

Hardcover
anthologies
which
draw
on
Little
Orphan
Annie
(daily episodes only), Dick Tracy
(again
dailies only), ToonerviUc
Folks. The Gumps, Bringing Up
Father, and Buck Rogers have ap-
peared recently enough
still to be

and on bargain tables.
beautifully drawn strip, for which Raebum Van Buren maintained a high level of nar-
rative and humor [485-496].
In Barnaby,
illustrator Crockett Johnson brought a memorable whimsical fantasy
(or itas the fairy godfather fantasy?)
to the comics pages, one which appealed to
both adults and children. Our episode reflects
its World \\'ar Il-period origins [505-
539]. (Dover Books has reprinted the Barnaby and Barnaby and Mr. O'Malley col-
lections in current paperback.
)
The Mickey Mouse narrative chosen here [542-643]
is dehghtfully topical of those
drawn by Floyd Gottfredson between 1930 and 1950. It is full of colorful incident and
character and demonstrates the kind of absorbing, ingenious, risible comic-strip story
often overlooked at the time by strip readers, who thought of the Mouse feature as in-
tended solely to entertain cliildren. The qualit>' of these early Mickey Mouse narra-
tives has recently been recognized by the Disney interests, and one, in a papercovered
volume by Gold Key
Mickey Mouse and the Bat Bandit—has already been released.
With the last strip selections in this section. Little Orphan Annie, Terry and the
Pirates, and Dick Tracy, we encounter the sequential linking of daily and Sunday
strip episodes through continuous
narrative, standard practice of the Chicago Tri-
bune-New York Daily News Syndicate through which these three strips were distrib-
uted. These fine Tribune-News Syndicate strips have been widely reprinted in recent
years in various formats. And Little Orphan Annie was reissued in the 1970s (with
some minor but pervasive changes ) in episodes that originated in the thirties. Terry
and the Pirates is being reprinted from the beginning by Nostalgia Press and the first
three volumes are available. Vintage Dick Tracy has recently appeared in a number
of forms, including a paperback series from Fawcett Gold Medal Books.
The Orphan Annie selection included here may surprise many individuals who had
assumed that the Harold Gray strip was an exercise in sentimentalit>' and political
conservatism.
It was a work of a much higher order of narrative imagination than
most strips. Gray devoted the majority of his waking hours to researching, writing,
and drawing Annie, and he told an often gripping story with a variety of strong char-
acters. This one, the end of a much longer narrative,
is one of his best
[644-672].
( Dover Books has republished two Annie narratives from 1926 and from 1933, as orig-
inally collected—and somewhat condensed—by the Cupples and Leon Company.
)
Most of the reprinting
in recent years
of Chester Gould's
detective
strip, Dick
Tracy, has emphasized Gould's relatively fanciful work of the forties, with
its amus-
ing galaxy of grotesque villains
( Flattop, Pruneface, and the rest )
. Here we draw on
his often savagely realistic material of the middle thirties, the pursuit and dispatching
of Boris Arson. Gould's delineation of the character and the environment of a type of
midwestern desperado of the period (for example, Cutie Diamond)
is exceptional, as
is his handling of the Indian officer working with Tracy, unusual and interesting
in
the context of the time [688-715].

In their early days
[the
comic strips had an importajit function!
as
a form of crude but vigorous satire at a time when American literature
in general was saccharine and imitative.
The meaner and littler aspects
of American life amd character were lampooned in the funnies long before
Sinclair Lewis discovered Main Street
or Babbitt .
And strip pictures
caricatured U.S. manners and mores at a time when the motion picture had
Mary Pickford,
America's sweetheart,
as its fairest flower.
Corrupted
by neither a literary training nor a literary tradition,
taking their
material from the life they observed around them,
the comic-strip artists
presented a series of extremely pointed
(and fundamentally ill-natured)
comments on the American public,
which promptly roared with lau^ter and
came eagerly back for more,

Cats, Dogs,
Possums, Counts,
and Others
A Comics Miscellany,
1928-1950
This section offers a selection of Sunday pages from some memorable strips. The pre-
ponderance of half-page and tabloid-page layouts rather cheerlessly indicates the en-
croaching reduction of space allowed comic-strip artists toward the close of the strip's
first half century. But the ample and colorful use of this halved area by cartoonists is
sometimes admirable.
Notes on strips in this section
The
first three selections
in
this section are
all by one of the great original and in-
imitably individual talents in the strip
field,
Milt Gross, whose Nize Baby, Count
Screwloose, and Dave's Delicatessen are among the most consistendy and irrepres-
sibly daffy of strips. Flowing from one into the other, with some of the same char-
acters traipsing into one feature and out of the other, Gross's strips use names only as
tags of convenience. They are
all slices of the great Gross comic cheesecake from
which two dozen delectable books and films were pared in his lifetime [716-718].
The comic strip Felix the Cat was drawn by Otto Mesmer, although
it was signed
by Pat Sullivan until the latter's death. Felix, a
feisty, inventive,
restless, yet some-
how delicate adventurer in his glass menagerie world, never attained the wide strip
following
that the charming enchantment
of his weekly and daily activities might
have earned him [719].
Al Capp's irreverent and crudely hilarious
Li'l Abner, the veritable yawp of the
newspaper comic strip, was at a creative peak from 1934 to 1944; the examples here
are from three of those Abner years [720-722].
Hejfi was begun when the Hearst chain raised
its Simday comic section from
six-
teen to thirt>'-two pages in 1935, and it provides this wonderful example of what hap-
pened when Dr. Seusss gorgeous lunacy moved briefly into comics [723].
Abie the Agent, Harry Hershfield's nervy and pioneering development of the first
definitively Jewish strip hero, from 1914 through the thirties, was a subtle, adult work
of humor and unspoken compassion, which deserves more analysis and discussion
than it has received. Here are two examples in the relaxed mood which the strip ac-
quired in Hershfield's later years [724-725].
This final selection of Herriman's Sunday Krazij Kat pages [726-733] are from the
great color tabloid period of 1934-44, eight examples of the rare work which, during
287

the artist's last decade, appeared consistendy in only two United States newspapers,
the Saturday New York Journal and the Saturday Chicago American. Herriman's
comic work, a national treasure comparable to Daumier's in France, deserves the per-
manence of a definitive and complete collection in boards, and the dignity of repub-
lication in the original size and color from beginning to end.
( Meanwhile, Nostalgia
Press has provided an anthology, now available in softcover.
)
^^'alt
Kelly's
insouciant Pogo
[734-737] was a
brilliant newspaper adaption,
in
daily and Sunday format, of a major strip which was originated and essentially per-
fected in comic-book format—the only instance of a comic-book creation moving
wholly and permanently into the newspaper
strip medium. Pogo became the
first
comic strip to have
its daily episodes reprinted virtually complete in book form, se-
quentially, year after year.
Gus Arriola's Gordo, with a cast of human and animal characters, remains a daily
delight in today's papers, with Sunday pages of e.xceptionally individual graphic de-
sign [738-7,39].
Casey Ruggles [741], Warren Tufts's somber, adult ^^'estem adventure strip, lasted
from May 1949 until late 1954
( and was ghosted in its later months )
. Its strong nar-
rative and brutal point-of-view clearly anticipated the
Italian Westerns of Sergio
Leone (A Fistful of Dollars, among others) and their imitations on both sides of the
Atlantic.
Krazy Kat,
the daily comic strip of George Herriman,
is,
to me,
the most amusing and fantastic
ajid
satisfactory work of art produced in America today.
With those who hold that a comic strip
cajinot
be a work of art
I shall not traffic,
.
.
.
Such
is the work which America can pride
itself on
having produced,
sind can hastily set about to appreciate. ...
It is wise with pitying irony j
it
has delicacy,
sensitiveness,
and an unearthly beauty.
The strange,
unnerving,
distorted trees,
the
language
inhuman,
unanimal,
the events so logical,
so wild,
are all magic carpets and faery
foajn —
all charged with unreality.
Throu^ them meauiders Krazy,
the most tender and the most foolish of
creatures,
a gentle monster of our new mythology.

The Return o£ the Funnies
What follows is a frankly subjecHve, perhaps even cursory, selection of comics, picked
to represent the dominant event on the comic pages during the recent past. And
much of the recent history of the comics centers on the arrival, success, and influence
of Charles Schulz's Peanuts.
The old family strip formula has been turned completely around, for what we have
is not a bunch of adults behaving like children but a group of children behaving like
neurotic adults. And the traditional American "bound to win" has quite often become
bom to loose.
More than that, the influence of the tiny, sparse panels of Schulz's
strip, plus the
increasing cost of paper and printing, have shrunk the size of all comics. So that we
not only see graphics clearly derivative of Schulz's style, but a general shrinkage in
comics in width and depth. Indeed, the venerable Dick Tracy is but one example of a
strip drawn so that its bottom quarter can be cropped off entirely, leaving it Schulz-
size. And some papers have been knowm to shrink all comics back to a mere two-col-
umn width.
Suffering the most, perhaps,
is the Sunday color comic section, with most comics
now available in either a third-page or
a quarter-page
format, with panels
either
shrunk or cropped off or dropped out.
Comics have long had a flexible format. In the 1930s King Features cartoonists were
instructed to provide three expendable panels. A
full page of Blondie, for example,
could become a half-page by dropping its companion top features, Colonel Potterby
and the Duchess, and omitting three of its Blondie panels.
Currently, the different syndicates use different methods for possible squeezing, but
the alert reader will notice herein several examples of the expendable (or expended)
top, whereby a comic could be easily condensed by dropping
its top Hne of panels,
leaving it two deep
Another result of smaller panels
is a static quality to some strips. Very good gags
may be delivered, and often are, in a three-panel format which virtually repeats itself
except for the dialogue balloons, an approach observable
in
the otherwise keenly
caricatured Tumbleweeds sequence reproduced here.
Fewer papers using fewer strips also means fewer outlets for cartoonists, with the
313

result that one cartoonist finds himself producing two (and sometimes more)
strips
in order to keep up. But more on that matter later.
For now, enough of complaints and abnost enough of
history. What
is
left
is
humor. Humor, and a gradual moving away from the "soap opera" strips that have
dominated the comics pages for three decades. But humor of that sort has been called
"adult," "sophisticated," and the rest. If it contains less out-and-out slapstick, knock-
about, and tumble, however,
it
is
still probably no more or less adult on the whole
than was comics humor in the past.
It
is only different—and
it
reflects the way a
United States with more citizens, more of whom have gone to college, sees
itself in
the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. In a major aspect. Broom Hilda
is,
after
all, the man-
chasing spinster stereotype we all know from traditional popular drama of all kinds.
Notes on strips in this section
A short-lived strip, but one much loved by devotees of comics. Jack Kent's King Aroo
[744-749] took much the same sophisticated approach to the naif materials of the
fairy tale as Krazy Kat had done to the animal fable or Bamaby had done to a child's
fantasy. The choice of King Aroo strips here is Jack Kent's own, by the way.
The influence of Peanuts [742-743] on both Mell Lazarus's Miss Peach [756] and
on Johnny Hart's B.C. [755] will be obvious, and
is acknowledged. But Lazarus has
also now given us Momma [759], a comics manifestation of the general consciousness
of the manipulative, possessive mother, be she Jewish or gentile. And Hart
is also
half the team, with Brant Parker, of the quasi-medieval farce The Wizard of Id [757].
What has been called the "Mort Walker factory," with Dik Browne and
Jerry
Dumas, produces
( or has produced ) Beetle Bailey, Hi and Lois, Hdgar the Horrible,
Boners Ark, and Sam's Strip. The first three
fit into dramatic-comic and strip
tradi-
tions and the fourth is about those traditions. Bailey is "service comedy,
" tellingly up-
dated [752]. Hi and Lois is a suburban family strip, but with a not always obvious
element of distaste and even dislike [758]. Hagar, when he is not looting,
is as glori-
ously henpecked as were Jiggs and Dagwood [753]. And Sam's Strip was about strips,
their characters and conventions, themselves. It is therefore a fitting way to end our
volume [761-763].
Meanwhile, there has been Doonesbury [754], which began as a student's strip at
Yale, and was inspired, in its early days, probably equally by Peanuts and by Jules
Feiffer's rhetorically conceived panel cartoons.
For our omissions in this final survey we apologize. For our brief overview of a de-
cade and a half, we hope to incur your enfightenment and your pleasure.

An Annotated Index of the Comics
Abbie
an'
Slats began in 1937, its eccentric characters and its somewhat amorphous locale created by
[485-496]
Al Capp, who also wrote the strip for its
first nine years and persuaded magazine
il-
lustrator Raeburn \'an Buren to draw
it. Capp was succeeded as the writer by his
brother, Elliott Caplin, who later became a prolific plotter of strips of all kinds. Caplin
continued to write Abbie an
Slats until the strip's demise in 1971.
Abie the Agent was first introduced by Harry Hershfield as a minor character in his burlesque melo-
[724-725]
drama Desperate Desmond. Abe Mendel Kabibble appeared in his own strip in 1914
as a sympathetically conceived ethnic type, a perpetually worried,
fiercely
active,
lower middle-class New York businessman. Hershfield himself was bom
in Cedar
Rapids, Iowa, and had been
a journeyman cartoonist since the age of fourteen
in
Chicago and San Francisco. Abies success, and his creator's own subsequent career
as a writer and speaker and raconteur, took Hershfield to New York. Abie ceased his
life as a Hearst feature in 1940.
Alley Oop by V. T. Hamlin began his life as a Newspaper Enterprise Association feature in 1933
[432-434]
and lived it as a comic caveman. Then in 1933, Hamlin introduced Professor Wonmug
and his time-machine, and that device carried Alley forward to the twentieth century
and then backward again to any era where the possibilities for a comic adventure
and for strong graphic design and (on Sundays) the fanciful use of color—seemed
promising. Hamlin, a native of Perry, Iowa, retired from the strip in 1971.
A. Mutt by Bud Fisher began as a sports page feature in 1907. He was joined by Jeff within
[41-46]
five months. See Mutt and Jeff.
A.
Piker Clerk appeared in the Chicago American in 1904, a pioneer cross-page daily strip, with a
[47]
horse-racing background, and the direct progenitor of A. Mutt, above.
Its author,
Clare
Briggs, was bom
in Redsburg,
^^'isconsin,
in 1875. Briggs was
later better
known for his daily panel feature, which was variously called When a Feller Needs a
Friend, There's One in Every Office, and other titles, and Mr. and Mrs., his Sunday
page. Briggs died in 1930.
Barnaby, Crockett Johnson's (David Leisk's)
delightful, somewhat literary fantasy of a boy
[505-539]
and his cigar-chomping fairy godfather. Mister O'Malley, began in PM in .\pril 1942.
The author turned the feature over
to others between late 1946 and 1952, when
Bamaby was dropped, to be briefly revived in 1962. Johnson, bom in 1906 in New
York, had begun as a magazine cartoonist. He turned to children's books in the 1950s
{Harold and his Purple Crayon and
its sequels). In his later years (he died in 1975)
he devoted himself to nonobjective painting.
Barney Google and Spark Plug began as a harassed husband, an offshoot of its author Billy De Beck's previous car-
[149-150; 278-319]
toon work, but reappeared as a sports-oriented
strip
in the San Francisco Herald-
Examiner in June 1919. Barney developed into a widely popular, picaresque rogue of
the big city during the 1920s and the Great Depression era. After a wistful, knock-
kneed race horse. Spark Plug, appeared in
1922,
the
strip changed
its name,
as
it
did again soon after Barney encountered the hillbilly Snuffy Smith in 1934. De Beck,
bom of middle-class parents in Chicago in 1890, attended
that
city's Academy of
Fine Arts and went immediately into cartoon work in 1910. He died in 1942. Barney
Google and Snuffy Smith continues today in Fred Lasswell's version.
Baron Bean was one of George Herriman's early strips. See Krazy Kat.
[54-77]
B.C. first appeared as a comic strip through the New York Herald Tribune Syndicate in
[755]
1958.
Its author, Johnny Hart, bom in Endicott, New York, in 1931, had tried out a
similar idea of a caveman community in earlier magazine cartoons. Hart began as a
325

cartoonist in the Pacific Stars and Stripes when he was in the Air Force during the
Korean conflict. See also The Wizard of Id.
•
Bear Creek Folks was an early strip by C. M. Payne, better known for his S'Matter Pop?
[24-25]
Beetle Bailey was the first (1950) of the strip successes of Mort Walker, who had already estab-
[752]
lished himself as a gag and panel cartoonist in such publications
as The Saturday
Evening Post—indeed Beetle, as "Spider," first appeared there. \\'alker was bom in
El Dorado, Kansas, in 1923 and raised in Kansas City. He received only a few casual
art lessons, served in the infantry in World ^^'a^ II, and worked as an editor for Dell
Publications in New York while cartooning in his spare time. Walker
is also founder
and guiding force behind the Museum of Cartoon Art in Greenwich, Connecticut.
See also Hi and Lois, Sara's Strip, and Hagar the Horrible.
Blondie was begun in 1930 by cartoonist Murat "Chic" Young of Chicago as a girlie strip.
It
[173]
concerned a gold digger who pursued a naive but rich playboy, Dagwood Bumstead.
The strip was soon converted into the most popular matriarchal family series. Young
died in 1973. The strip is continued by son Dean and John Raymond.
Bobby Thatcher, George Storm's second boys' adventure
strip,
set standards for graphic style, char-
[179-190]
acterizations, and narrative invention and pace between 1927 and 1937, after which
Storm decided to discontinue his tale. Storm was earlier responsible for Phil Hardy,
which began in 1925 and has been called the first boys' adventure strip.
Boob McNutt, Rube Goldberg's Sunday-only strip, lasted from 1915 to 1934. Begun as a low-comedy
[157-158]
gag strip, it was converted to comic adventure with the addition of Boob's girlfriend.
Pearl, a rival named Major Gumbo, the twins Mike and Ike (they look alike), and
Bertha the Siberian Cheesehound. Goldberg, bom in 1883, began as a cartoonist with
the campus magazine of the University of California at Berkeley, and was a major
contributor to the development of the comics. Best remembered for his zany cartoon
inventions, he created and drew many other comic and sports page and even editorial
cartoons before he died in 1970.
Braggo
the Monk was one of several alternating
titles given to Gus Mager's "Monk" strips. See Sher-
[34]
locko the Monk and Hawkshaw the Detective.
Bringing Up Father, George McManus's low-comic saga of Jiggs, an Irish-American bricklayer made sud-
[144-145; 479-484]
denly wealthy by the Irish Sweepstakes, and Maggie,
his
socially ambitious
wife,
began as a daily strip for the Hearst papers in 1913. McManus, born in
St. Louis in
1884, had been a cartoonist for that city's Republic, beginning at age sixteen. Bringing
Up Father juxtaposed his broad caricatures with his fine draftsmanship and sense of
space and depth. The strip has been continued beyond McManus's death in 1954 (al-
though
it had sometimes been ghosted meanwhile )
. See The Newlyweds and Nibsy
the Newsboy.
Broom Hilda, Russ Myers's cigar-chomping, beer-guzzling witch
( who claims once to have been
[760]
married to Attila the Hun),
first appeared on the comics pages in 1970. Myers was
bom in Pittsburg, Kansas,
in 1938 and spent his apprenticeship conceiving humor-
ous greeting cards for the Hallmark Company.
Buck Nix, Sidney Smith's
early humanized animal
strip, began
in the Chicago Examiner
in
[92-95]
1908. See Old Doc Yak and The Gumps.
Buck Rogers concerned a twentieth-century American who awakes after a sleep of five centuries.
[427-428]
It began as pulp fiction, Armaggedon 2415 by Phil Nowlan, and in 1929 became the
first science-fiction comic strip, as plotted by Nowlan and drawn by Dick Calkins.
The feature continued
until 1967,
the work of a number of writers and illustrators
after 1947.
The Bungle Family, Harry Tuthill's penetrating burlesque of the compulsive and harassed
big-city
lives
[163-169; 540-541]
of George and Jo Bungle, has been called one of the most inventive and artistic of all
326

comic strips. It began in the New York Evening Mail in 1918 as Home Sweet Home.
Tuthill, born in the Chicago slums in 1886, led the life of an itinerant salesman from
the age of nine, offering everything from newspapers to fake patent medicines, while
trying to teach himself a drawing style that would carry his wryly comical sense of
human character and relationships. He landed his first newspaper job in St. Louis on
the Post-Dispatch
in the
art department
in
1910 and
took some
night-school
art
courses with the income. He folded the successful Bungles in mid- 1942, apparently
because of syndicate pressure to make it a more cheerful family strip, but revived
it
eight months later and distributed it himself. He retired in 1945 and died in St Louis
in 1957.
Buster Brown was R. F. Outcault's second important strip, the adventures of a likable, upper-class
[3-5]
brat,
in contrast
to his lower-class Yellow Kid
(see Hogan's Alley). Outcault was
bom in 1863 in Lancaster, Ohio, and had established himself with gag cartoons in the
old Life and Judge magazines before introducing his hearty urchins and the Yellow
Kid to the New York World.
Buster's adventures began
in 1902 in the New York
Herald, and, although they were discontinued in 1920, Buster and his grinning dog
Tige remained familiar figures in American popular culture, even
after Outcault's
death in 1928.
Captain Easy was (also as Washington Tubhs II and Wash Tubbs) the premier comic adventure
[435-437]
strip. It began in 1924 as a humor strip but soon began its journeys to the far comers
of the real and imaginary world. Roy Crane, whose inventive and innovative graphics
carried the strip as much as did his narrative fancy and sense of pace, was bom in Abi-
lene, Texas, in 1901. In 1943 Crane began Buzz Sawyer, while Easy and Tubbs were
taken over by his former assistant, Leslie Turner. See Wash Tubbs.
Casey Ruggles was the work of ex-actor and radio and television
scripter Warren Tufts, bom
in
[741]
Fresno, Califomia, in 1925. Tufts had little formal art training, but his strip work was
thoroughly professional from the start. He did the short-lived science fiction strip The
Lone Spacenmn, as well as Lance, a full-page art feature with highly sophisticated
color treatment. Casey Ruggles began in May 1949.
Chantecler Peck. Beyond the fact that it appeared on March
11, 1911, in Joseph Pulitzer's New York
[38]
World, we can offer no further information on this feature or its artist. The popular
concept of the rooster, and his name, go back to a whole series of medieval tales, of
course, one of which Chaucer retold.
Count Screwloose
( of Tooloose ) was one of several zany strips by Milt Gross. He began
it in 1929 and
[717]
continued it either as the bottom or top Sunday feature until 1934, when the Count
joined the company of clowns at Dave's Delicatessen. Gross
( 1895-1953) was a native
of New York Cit>' who began drawing at age twelve, and created a variety of strip
characters {That's My Pop, Nize Baby) and books of humorous doggerel verse, fre-
quently in Yiddish dialect {Hiawatta Witt No Odder Poems)
Dave's Delicatessen began as a 1931 daily and Sunday feature by Milt Gross. In early 1935, it was joined
[718]
by Gross's other favorite. Count Screwloose
( see preceding )
Desperate Desmond was Harry Hershfield's first strip for the Hearst papers and a direct imitation of C. W.
[37]
Kahles's Hairbreadth Harry. See Abie the Agent.
Dick Tracy was created by Chester Gould in 1931. Gould, bom in Pawnee, Oklahoma, in 1900,
[688-715]
the son of a newspaper publisher, had been a sports cartoonist and had done a movie-
burlesque strip, Fillum Fables. With his plainclothes detective, he discovered an ex-
ceptional talent for strip narrative and a bizarre, sometimes bmtal, sense of character-
ization and atmosphere.
Dok's Dippy Duck by John "Dok" Hager appeared locally in the Seattle Times in 1917. Hager had been
[84-91]
a dental surgeon (hence the "Dok") with an interest in caricature until he moved
from Terre Haute, Indiana, to Seattle in 1889 and went to work for the Times. He re-
tired in 1925 because of blindness, and died in 1932 at seventy-four.
327

Doonesbury began as Bull Tales in the Yale Record in 1968, moved to the Yale Daily News the
[754]
following year, and (named for one of its protagonists) moved into national news-
paper syndication in late 1970. It is the work of Garry Trudeau, who was bom in New
York City in 1948 and
is a graduate of the Yale School of .\rt and Architecture. His
strip has occasionally been censored by having daily episodes dropped by subscrib-
ing papers for his satiric but candid treatment of politics, drugs, and sex.
The Family
Upstairs. This was The Dingbat Family, George Herriman's early
strip,
in whose basement
[48-53]
Krazy Kat first appeared.
Felix the Cat began as an animated cartoon, the work of Australian-bom Pat Sullivan, and moved
[719]
to the comics in 1923. The strip was ghosted by several hands. Otto Mesmer being
the most frequently mentioned and talented candidate.
Flash Gordon was the work of magazine and comics illustrator Alex Raymond
( although he did not
[430]
plot the strip), born in 1909 in New Rochelle, New York. Ra>'mond had previously
worked with Russ Westover on
Tillie the Toiler and Lyman Young on Tim Tylers
Luck. Raymond's best work was a unique combination of physiological realism and
graphic fantasy. During the Second World War, when Raymond served in the Marine
Corps, the strip was taken over by others. When Raymond retmned
to
civilian
life,
he began the detective strip Rip Kirby, and continued
it until he was killed
in an
automobile accident in 1956.
Gasoline Alley began (at first, as a single panel) in 1918, and was devoted to the country's then-new
[151-156]
fascination with automobiles.
It became a family strip in which the characters aged
in "real time"
( as opposed to "dramatic" or, one might say, "strip time" ) with the in-
troduction of the foundling "Skeezix" on "Uncle Walt" Wallet's doorstep in 1921 and
Walt's subsequent marriage to Phyllis Blossom. The
strip's
author-illustrator, Frank
King, was bom in Cashton, Wisconsin, in 1883 and began as a professional cartoon-
ist on the Minneapolis Times in 1901. Moving to Chicago, he tried several unsuccess-
ful strips until Bobby Make-Believe
( in 1915 ) and then Gasoline Alley. King's gen-
tle continuity reached
its narrative best in the 1930s and 1940s. King died in 1969
but his strip has continued and is today done, daily and Sunday, by Dick Moores, who
carries on its tradition of graphic resourcefulness and interest.
Gordo, Gus Arriola's brilliant graphic fantasy on the life of a contemporary Mexican bache-
[738-739]
lor, began in 1941 and featured strong characterizations and attractive graphics from
the start. Arriola, bom in 1917 in Arizona, grew up in Los Angeles and worked as an
animator on MGM cartoons. He was also the only artist to suspend his daily strip
during his service in World War II and resume it after his discharge.
The Gumps, Sidney Smith's enormously popular serial drama
of lower middle-class family
Hfe,
[96-102; 128-129]
began in 1917, conceived by Chicago Tribune publisher Joseph Patterson and exe-
cuted by Smith (and sometimes ghosted by others, even in its early years). Smith was
bom in Bloomington,
Illinois, in 1877 and had been responsible for the humanized
animal strips. Buck Nix and Old Doc Yak, in both the Examiner and Tribune. When
Smith was killed in 1935, The Gumps was continued by his assistant, Gus Edson.
Hagar the Horrible was begun by Dik Browne in 1973 and became an almost instant success. The
title
[753]
character, who looks remarkably
like Browne himself,
is a sort of cross between an
ancient Viking plunderer and the traditional henpecked husband and father. See Hi
and Lois.
Hairbreadth Harry was the work of C. W. Kahles, bom in Germany in 1878 and raised in Brooklyn after
[143]
the age of six. Kahles had already been a cartoonist for several years when he
first
drew Harry in 1906. Harry began as a boy hero, but around 1916 had reached young
manhood. On Kahles's death in 1931, the strip was continued for eight more years by
F. O. Alexander.
The Hall-Room Boys was the work of illustrator-cartoonist H. A. (Harold Arthur) McGill and began in the
[35]
New York American in 1906. It was at first a three-column, upright panel, usually di-
328

vided into six frames, and presented the adventures of two of Mrs. Pruyn's ambitious
boarders. McGill
later continued
the
strip as Percy ami Ferdtj, distributed by the
Sun-Herald's syndicate. McGill died in 1952 at age seventy-six.
Hans und
Fritz. See Katzenjammer Kids.
[7]
Happy Hooligan was the classic Irish-American tramp. Fred Opper's strip began
in Hearst's Sunday
[9; 159]
comic sections in both New York and San Francisco in 1900. Opper was born in Mad-
ison, Ohio, the son of Austrian immigrant
parents,
in
1857. Opper also introduced
Maud the Mule and Alphon^e and Gaston, and became a Hearst political cartoonist
as well. Failing eyesight forced him to discontinue Hooligan and most of his other
work in 1932. He died in 1938.
Hawkshaw the Detective was born out of Gus Mager's Sherlocko the Monk in 1913 when the American repre-
[31]
sentatives of A. Conan Doyle, author of the Sherlock Holmes
stories, threatened a
lawsuit. Sherlocko was quickly humanized along with his assistant, now called "the
Colonel." Mager discontinued Hawkshaw in mid-1922, but he was later revived as a
companion feature to Rudolph Dirks's The Captain and the Kids. Mager sometimes
did the strip on this revival, but during other periods
it was ghosted
(as was The
Captain) by the gifted Bernard Dibble. Hawkshaw retired with Mager in the later
1940s. See Braggo the Monk.
Hejji was a Hearst-King Features Sunday page of comic fantasy by Dr. Seuss that appeared
[723]
briefly
in
1935. Seuss (Theodor Geisel) had previously done magazine cartoons (a
well-remembered series in Liberty) and advertising drawings ("Quick, Henry, the
Flit!" was his )
. He later, of course, became famous for his children's books
( The Cat
in the Hat, Horton Hears a Hoo, et al. ), and he was a master of comic doggerel verse.
Hi and Lois by Mort Walker (scripts) and Dik Browne (drawing)
is a suburbanite family strip
[758]
which
first appeared in 1954, and which frequently reverses the attitudes and char-
acterizations of older strips in its genre. Browne was bom in 1918 in New York City
and worked his way up from newsboy to cartoonist on the old New York Journal. Be-
fore joining the Walker group, he had done advertising
art. See
also Beetle Bailey
and Hagar the Horrible.
Hogan's Alley was one of several slum place-names given to R. F. Outcault's Sunday feature page in
[1]
the New York World.
It was also the name which
stuck. Hogan's Alley featured
a bald child in a yellow nightshirt who quickly became known as "The Yellow Kid,"
and Outcault's page was renamed again. See Buster Brown.
Jimmy,
later Little Jimmy, was James Swinnerton's most famous
strip, begun in 1904 (but
[10]
appearing sporadically at first) and continuing until 1958, except for a break in the
1940s when Swinnerton switched to Rocky Mason. Swinnerton was bom in Eureka,
California,
in 1875, and raised in Stockton, where his father was a newspaper pub-
lisher and politician. The younger Swinnerton began a series of weekly bear draw-
ings.
Little Bears, on the San Francisco Examiner children's page, the
first contin-
uously presented graphic character feature in a newspaper. Swinnerton also did Mr.
Jack, the well-remembered, female-chasing, humanized
tiger. He
retired
in
1958,
turned to landscape painting, and died in Arizona in 1974.
Johnny Wise, by Thomas Aloysius "Tad" Dorgan, was a short-lived, weekly 1902 color-page effort
[2]
by a man who was later and better known for his slangy sports cartoons and "Indoor
Sports" panel feature. Dorgan was born to laborer parents in San Francisco in 1877
and had been urged to develop his drawing talents while recuperating from
a
fac-
tory accident at age thirteen. His drawing style and comic attitudes had an effect on
early cartoonists and readers alike. He died unexpectedly on Long Island in 1929.
Katzenjammer Kids
( in German slang of the time "the hangover kids" ) was begun in 1897 by Rudolph
[6; 146-148]
Dirks when Rudolph Block of Hearst's Neic York Journal suggested he model a
comics feature on the captioned German cartoon series of Wilhelm Busch depicting the
329

destructive brats Max und Moritz. In the result. Dirks combined strip continuity and
talk balloons for the first time in comics history. Dirks was bom in Germany in 1877,
and emigrated to Chicago at age seven with his parents. At twenty he was selling
cartoons to Life and Judge, popular humor magazines of the time. In one of the most
interesting events in early comics history. Dirks went off on a European vacation in
1912 and Hearst had his feature continued. Dirks sued, and after much litigation he
was awarded the rights to use his characters, but Hearst retained tide to the strip.
Thus Dirks began Haas und Fritz, later The Captain and the Kids, and Harold Knerr
(1883-1949), of Bryn Mawr and Philadelphia, took over Katzenjammer Kids and
continued their adventures in sometimes superbly conceived destruction. Dirks died
in 1968. Both strips, however, continued into the 1970s.
The Kin-der-Kids was created by painter and illustrator Lyonel Feininger for the Chicago Tribune in
[16-18]
1906 at the suggestion of James Keeley. Keeley undoubtedly had the Katzenjammers
in mind, but Feininger wrought a motley crew of kids and adults and put them into
uniquely ludicrous adventures. Feininger, bom in New York in 1871, had been given
a musical education in Germany by his parents. In 1894 he began a career as an
illustrator for magazines there and in France and the United States. He quit the Kids
after a few months after a contractual dispute with his publishers and pursued a suc-
cessful career in painting until his death in 1956.
King Aroo
is one of the most celebrated strips of the recent past in the comics, but celebrated
[744-749]
largely among devotees of comics, and appealing largely to members of the reader-
ship that loved Krazy Kat, Bamabij, Togo, and Little Nemo. The King was the crea-
tion of Jack Kent, bom in Burlington, Iowa, in 1920.
It was probably Kent's lack of
formal art training that led him to a loose-lined art st\'le, with panels full of characters
and activity. It was surely his innate artistic ability that kept those panels from look-
ing cluttered. The strip began in 1950 in national syndication but was discontinued
after a few
years.
It was kept on
in limited
syndication
until
1965 by
Stanleigh
Arnold's small Golden Gate Features. Today Kent devotes most of his time to chil-
dren's book illustration.
Krazy Kat, the most highly praised of all comic strips, was begun by George Herriman as a cat-
[170-172; 726-733]
and-mouse chase, a part of his Dingbat Family strip. Krazy got his own strip in Octo-
ber 1913, and thus the imaginative fantasy life of Krazy and Ignatz Mouse and the
other inhabitants of Kokonino County began.
It was continued, often solely because
William Randolph Hearst liked
it although a mass public did
not,
until Herriman
died in Los Angeles in 1944. Herriman had been bom in 1880 in New Orleans but
was raised in Los Angeles. Estranged from his family, he was drawing cartoons and
working as an office boy at the Los Angeles Herald before he was t\venty. He rode the
rails to New York and finally landed a staff cartoonist job at the World in 1901, even-
tually ending up with Hearst for whom he did several strips before settling down to
Krazy Kat alone.
Li'I Abner began with almost instant success in August 1934. Cartoonist Al Capp
( Alfred Cap-
[720-722]
lin), whether he was really aware of it or not, was offering his own feisty variation of
the favorite American story of the yokel
(or, in this case, Yokum) who exposes the
foibles and corruptions of the city slickers simply by maintaining his own naivet^.
Capp, who
still manages to people his strip with memorably lampooned characters
and events after more than forty years, was born in 1909 in New Haven, Connecticut,
to a father who wrote and drew his own comics
for the amusement of
his
family.
Capp attended a number of art schools and did some work at the Associated Press be-
fore he became an assistant of Ham Fisher, creator oijoe Palooka.
Little Joe was a Sunday feature by Ed Leffingwell, Harold Gray's cousin, assistant, and letterer
[438-439]
on Little Orphan Annie. The story concerned a thirteen-year-old on a modem cattle
ranch owned by his widowed mother and managed by Utah, a cowhand with a shady
past. Gray himself wrote and drew much of the strip. When Ed Leffingwell died his
330

brother, Robert, who also assisted Gray, took over as Joe's nominal author. The strip
continued into the late 1950s in both the Chicago Tribune and New York Sunday
News comic sections.
Little Nemo undoubtedly grew out of Winsor McCay's earlier Dreams of a Rarebit Fiend
( 1904),
[11-14; 140-142]
which showed the nightmarish results of his protagonist's overeating. Nemo
first ap-
peared as Little Nemo in Slumberland the following year in the New York Herald,
and represented pictorially the feelings and transformations experienced in the dreams
of McCay's boy protagonist. When McCay moved to Hearst's papers in 1911, he sim-
ply retitled his feature In The Land of Wonderful Dreams and continued Nemo's
nocturnal adventures
until
1914. Nemo reappeared in 1924,
this time back
in the
Herald (and, of course,
its syndicate)
until 1927. McCay was born
in Spring Lake,
Michigan,
in 1869 and received basic
art
instruction from
a teacher
in
Ypsilanti.
When he was seventeen he was in Chicago seeking more instruction but working pro-
fessionally on posters as well. He began as a cartoonist on the Cincinnati Enquirer in
1903. McCay was also a pioneer in film animation, beginning in 1909. His best-known
movie cartoon is Gertie the Trained Dinosaur, but he had also earher filmed a Nemo
fantasy. Next to George Herriman's, McCay's comics work has probably received the
widest recognition and praise. He died in 1934.
Little Orphan Annie reputedly began as a boy in Harold Gray's original conception, and was changed to a
[644-672]
redheaded orphan
girl by Joseph Patterson of the New York News. In any case, her
narrative began in 1924 and lasted beyond her creator's death in 1968 in contin-
uations
of ever-decreasing
interest
until
reprints
of Gray's
earlier
strips replaced
them. Gray was born
in Kankakee,
Illinois, in 1894 and served his apprenticeship
assisting Sidney Smith on The Gumps. With Annie he established a feature of excep-
tional narrative interest and pace. Although, of course. Gray did use
assistants, he
hired no ghosts either to draw or plot Annie, and maintained his personal interest in
his work for forty-five years.
Mama's Angel Child,
Esther, was the work of Penny Ross of whom little is known except that he was a man,
[23]
and that he had assisted Outcault on Buster Brown and possibly ghosted that strip
on occasion.
Maud was established as And Her Name Was Maud
as
a topper
strip
to Fred Opper's
[8]
Happy Hooligan in 1926. But the character of the grinning, stubborn, kicking mule,
Maud, had been used by Opper in his earlier strips. See Happy Hooligan.
Merely Margy began as Oh! Margy in the late 1920s and was a comics effort by John Held,
Jr., who
[161]
was and
is best known for his depiction of leggy, flat-chested 1920s "flappers." Bom
in 1889, Held was from Salt Lake City. He had begun as a cartoonist when barely six-
teen, and had also been a sports page and, later, magazine illustrator on Vanity Fair
and The New Yorker. Margy lasted until 1935. Held died in 1958, having long since
turned to sculptiire.
Mickey Mouse was not the first star of animated cartoons to gain a strip of his own, but he had one
[542-643]
by January 1930. Three months later, when the Walt Disney studios turned the project
over
to Floyd Gottfredson, and he introduced broadly burlesqued adventure and
melodrama as its basis, the strip began to thrive. By the early 1950s, however, King
Features, which distributed the feature, had urged the elimination of all action-adven-
ture from humor strips, and Mickey returned to a domestic gag-a-day. Gottfredson,
bom in 1907 in Kaysville, Utah, was delighted with the comics as a young man, and
took correspondence courses in cartooning. He moved to Hollywood, applied at Dis-
ney's, and was put on as an apprentice animator. Until 1938, he also did the frequendy
charming Mickey Mouse Sunday color strip.
Midsummer Day Dreams by Winsor McCay. See Little Nemo.
[40]
Minute Movies,
the creation of Edgar Wheelan, began as Midget Movies in 1918. It not only parodied
[191-196]
movie
serials,
it
also
helped
establish
the
idea
of
continuity
in
the
daily
strip.
331

Wheelan created his own imaginary studio and stable of stereotypical stars and con-
tract players
( Ralph McSneer, Hazel Deare). He cast them in mysteries, adventm-es,
love stories, and
(later) the classics. The strip lasted on the comics pages until the
mid-1930s (but later appeared in new episodes in the Flash Comics book). Wheelan
was bom in San Francisco in 1888, and graduated from Cornell. His mother had been
a comic-strip cartoonist, and he began with the Hearst papers
as an editorial and
sports cartoonist. He died in Florida in 1966.
Miss Peach
first appeared to instant success in 1957. Admittedly and obviously inspired in part by
[756]
Peanuts, the feature was the work of Mell Lazarus, bom in Brooklyn, New York, in
1927, where, as he has said, he hated school and "even flunked art in high school."
See Momma.
Momma was Mell Lazarus's second successful strip, introduced in late 1970. A comic-strip ver-
[759]
sion of the possessive, manipulative "Jewish mother,"
if the temi
is taken to mean a
generic and descriptive and not necessarily ethnic type. See Miss Peach.
Moon Mullins, Frank Willard's winning rogue, put in his first appearance in the Chicago Tribune in
[138-139; 221-277]
1923, partly as an answer to Hearst's success with Barney Google. As the strip accu-
mulated characters of
its own
( Kayo, Emmie Schmaltz, Lord Plushbottom, Mamie,
Uncle
^^'illie) and a narrative pace of
its own,
it became one of the classics of the
comics page. Willard was bom in the Chicago area in 1893, the son of a physician,
and he early determined to become a cartoonist. He died suddenly in 1958. His assist-
ant (and sometime ghost) Ferd Johnson continued Moon, but today the continui-
ties of its past are gone and it is a gag strip.
Mr.
E.
Z. Mark was the work of F. M. Howarth
( 1870 ?-1908), whose strip drawing in Puck in the
[32]
1890s probably helped pave the way for the comic strip. In 1903 he was approached
by William Randolph Hearst and the result was the Luhi and Leander pages. Howarth
never employed talk balloons, even in the Hearst section.
Mr.
Jack, James Svvinnerton's humanized, pop-eyed, skirt-chasing tiger, first appeared as a sep-
[33]
arate feature in late 1902 and ran almost weekly until early 1904. It was revived as an
occasional daily from 1912 to 1919, only to be revived again as a top feature above
Little Jimmy in the 1930s. See Jimmy.
Mr, Twee Deedle was a Sunday feature, a fantasy-fairy tale for small children by Johnny Gmelle, crea-
[20]
tor of Raggedy Ann. The strip replaced Little Nemo in the New York Herald when
Winsor McCay moved his feature over to Hearst. Gruelle, born in Illinois but raised
in Indianapolis, was the son of a landscape painter, and was a cartoonist with the
Indianapolis Star and Cleveland Press when
still
in his late teens. He contributed
illustrations, cartoons, and children's stories to a number of magazines, and wrote the
Raggedy books and others. Gruelle lived in Connecticut after 1910. He returned to the
comics with the Sunday strip Brutus in the late 1930s. He died in Miami in 1938.
Mutt and
Jeff began as A. Mutt, when H. C. "Bud" Fisher established the first continually published
[28-29; 108-125; 136-137]
six-days-a-week strip on the San Francisco Chronicle sports page on November
15,
1907. Fisher, born in Chicago in 1885, left for a job at the Chronicle during his third
year at the University of Chicago. His unique drawing style and comic point of view
developed quickly during the early years when he did the strip himself, moving
it
from syndicate to syndicate as the value of his services rose. Fisher died in 1954, but
the strip had by then been ghosted for years. And, of course,
it continues today.
The Naps of Polly Sleepyhead was Peter Newell's contribution to the early comics page. Newell, better known for
[21]
his fanciful children's books (Topsys and Turvys, The Hole Book, The Slant Book),
was bom in Bashnell, Illinois, in 1862 and was
largely self-taught, although he did
some work at the Art Students League in New York. He died in 1927.
Naughty Pete was the work of Charles Forbell, who was best known for his cityscape and architec-
[22]
tural perspective drawings in Puck, Life, and Judge. It appeared in Judge from after
332

1910 until its demise in the late 1930s. The "& A.C." appended to Forbell's name (and
that of other cartoonists) was for Arthur Crawford, a cartoonist's agent and gagman.
The Newlyweds (or The Newhjueds and Their Baby) was the feature which George McManus did
[19]
for Pulitzer's VV'orW between 1904 and 1912. When he moved over to Hearst in that
latter year, McManus renamed the feature Their Onhj Child. When his Bringing Up
Father had established itself by 1918, he discontinued Their Only Child. But in the
1930s, he brought
it back on Sundays as Snookutns, a cofeature to Maggie and Jiggs.
See Bringing Up Father.
Nibsy the Newsboy, another early George McManus feature, appeared in the New York World between
[15]
April 1905 and late Jul\' 1906. Nibsy 's imagination could turn any New York street into
'Funny Fairyland" and a kind of lower-class takeoff on Little Nemo. See Bringing
Up Father.
Nize Baby, by Milt Gross
(his
first Sunday color page), appeared in the New York World (and
[716]
its syndicate ) between 1927 and 1929. However, the wild adventures of the nefarious
infant and Looy Dot Dope were abandoned by the restlessly inventive Gross for
Count Screwloose.
Old Doc Yak was Sidney Smith's very successful transformation of his Buck Nix when he moved
[ 103-107]
from the Chicago Examiner to the Chicago Tribune. See The Gumps and Buck Nix.
Our Boarding House, with the braggart Major Hoople, began in 1923 as a single daily panel in comics form
[497-504]
for Newspaper Enterprise Association. On his Sunday page, the Major (in true strip
form ) was joined by the top-of-the-page "Nut Brothers"
( Ches and Wall ) in a surreal
comic fantasy. The strips were the creation of Gene Ahem, born on Chicago's South
Side in 1895. He attended the Chicago Art Institute for three years, hoping simply to
acquire enough technique to become a funny cartoonist. Ahem moved to King Fea-
tures in 1936, doing a variant of the same Boarding House strip as Room and Board,
while his former syndicate continued Our Boarding House, and does still. Ahem died
in 1960.
Out Our Way began national distribution
in November 1921 as a single-panel, daily feature and
[175-178]
soon developed a set of memorable recurring characters and a unique comic view-
point. The author was
J. R. \MUiams, born in Nova Scotia in 1888 of American par-
ents, and raised in Detroit. He left home to shift for himself in his mid-teens, worked
the railroads, and did a hitch in the cavalry before settling into a factory job, where
he did his
first cartooning for the company's catalog. After Williams's death in 1957
his drawings were frequently reissued by his syndicate, NEA, while his former assis-
tant, Ned Cochran, contributed new ones to the series.
Peanuts, introduced on October 2, 1950, by Charles Schulz, revived interest in the humor strip,
[742-743]
recast the size and shape of strips and the format of the comics page, and became one
of the great success stories of the comics. Schulz was bom in Minneapolis
in 1922
and studied art by a correspondence course before he graduated from high school. He
had placed a few gag panel cartoons in newspapers and the Saturday Evening Post
before finally placing his
strip, which he originally wanted to call
L'il Folks, with
United Features Syndicate.
Pogo, by ex-Disney animator Walt Kelly, actually began as a feature in Animal Comics in
[734-737]
1943 under the title Bumbazine and Albert the Alligator. In
it, Pogo the Possum was
initially a minor character at best. Very soon the clownish Albert was more promi-
nently featured, Bumbazine (a boy) dropped out, and Pogo got a bigger role. By the
time that Kelly moved the feature to newspaper format in the short-lived New York
Star in 1948,
it had become simply Pogo, and in
it humanized animals daily drama-
tized the idiosyncrasies of their human counterparts. The political spoofs for which
the strip probably became best known in the mid-1950s had actually been impUcit
somewhat earlier.
( See nos. 734-737) Kelly was bom in Philadelphia in 1913, the son
of a painter of theatrical scenery. He had been a reporter and cartoonist
for the
333

Bridgeport Post just out of high school. When Kelly died in 1973, Pogo was briefly
continued by others but was soon withdrawn h\ Kelly's widow, who devotes herself
to editing books which collect his work.
Polly and Her Pals
(at first Positive Polly in 1912) was begun as one of several "daughter" strips of the
[130-135]
period. Its author was Cliff Sterrett, bom in Fergus Falls, Minnesota, in 1883. He at-
tended the Chase Arts School in New York for two years, and he began as a staff artist
for the New York Herald in 1904, moving to the Titnes in 1908. However, Sterrett
wanted to be a cartoonist, and three years later he began four different strips for the
New York Evening Telegram. Settling on
Pollij, he gradually developed one of the
most whimsically individual graphic st\les in the comics section, particularly on his
Sunday color work. He and Polly retired in 1958 and he died December 28, 1964.
Popeye.
See Thimble Theatre.
Prince Valiant began in 1937 as a carefully researched, meticulously illustrated Sunday saga of imag-
[431 ]
inary Arthurian times. It was created by Harold R. "Hal" Foster, bom in Nova Scotia in
1892. In 1921 the ambitious young Foster bicycled his vva\' to Chicago, to the Art In-
stitute, National Academy of Design, and Chicago .Academy of Fine Arts. He was an
established advertising
illustrator when the syndicators of a new Tarzan text-and-
illustration strip approached him. Foster did the first daily Tarzan sequence in early
1929 and later did the Sunday episodes from 1931 until he began Prince Valiant. He
retired from the drawing of Prince Valiant in 1971 but continued to plot his tale. See
Tarzan.
Sam's
Strip, unsuccessful with the public, was a well-remembered
effort
to make a comic
strip
[761-763]
which fondly spoofed the conventions, characters, and histor>' of comic strips. Mort
\\'alker conceived
the
idea with
Jerr\' Dumas, who did the
art. Dumas, bom
in
Detroit in 1930, had very little formal training, but has been cartooning steadily since
his school days. He assists on most of the Walker strips, lettering, pencifing, inking.
See Beetle Bailey and Hi and Lois.
School Days was one of several Sunday and daily strips by Clare Victor Dwiggins
(1874-1959)
[26-27; 197-208]
which depicted the almost idyllic small town life of a group of school boys. One of his
strips was an authorized version of Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn. Dwig-
gins was himself bom in mral Ohio and attended country schools. He undertook car-
tooning while working as an architectural draftsman. He drew School Days from 1917
to 1932. Between 1945 and his death, Dwiggins worked as a book illustrator.
Secret Agent X-9 was begun by Hearst's King Features Syndicate in 1932 as one of several efforts
to
[475-478]
answer the success of the Chicago Tribune-New York Daily News detective feature,
Dick Tracy. The syndicate hired mystery writer Dashiell Hammett to plot (he did the
first four sequences) and
Ale.x Raymond
to illustrate. The strip has been through
numerous transmutations since that time, with various writers and
illustrators con-
tributing.
It continues today as Secret Agent Corrigan. See Flash Cordon.
Sherlocko the Monk was Gus Mager's Holmes burlesque, later transformed into Hawkshaw the Detec-
[36]
five. See the latter and also Braggo the Monk.
Skippy began his cartoon Hfe in the pages of the old humor magazine Life as a somewhat sar-
[ 174]
donic ten-year-old commentator on the passing scene and the world adults had made.
In 1928, Skippy became a King Features comic strip, daily and Sunday, and contin-
ued until Percy Crosby withdrew the feature in 1943, in protest against its unauthor-
ized commercial use. Crosby, whose drawing style was always closer to sketch-illus-
tration than cartoon, was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1891 and did newspaper and
strip work on the New York World and for the McClure Syndicate before Skippy at-
tracted the attention of King Featiires. He died in 1964.
Slim Jim, an early and all-but-forgotten strip, was drawn variously by several cartoonists, most
[30]
notably by
its originator, Charles Frink (who died in 1912), and his successor, Ray-
334

mond Ewer, who contributed our fine selection here. Slim Jim began as Circus Solly
in 1910, and continued until 1937, mostly distributed to rural papers.
S'Matter Pop? was one of several similar titles assigned to the best-known strip of Charles M. Payne.
[39; 160]
Payne was born in Queenstown, Pennsylvania, in 1873. He hung around the offices of
the Pittsburgh Post and offered cartoon ideas while
still
a teenager;
later, he was
hired by the paper as a staff cartoonist. S'Matter Pop?, notable for Payne's decorative
use of the page as well as its humor, began in the New York World in 1919 and con-
tinued for thirty years. Payne died in poverty and obscurity in New York in 1964, the
victim of a mugging. See Bear Creek Folks.
The Smythes was a Sunday feature in the New York Herald Tribune (and
its syndicate) by New
[126-127]
Yorker illustrator and art editor Rea Irvin (1881-1972).
Irvin was from San Fran-
cisco and was an established magazine
illustrator and cartoonist both before and
after his stylized interlude on the comics page.
Somebody's Stenog, distributed by the Philadelphia Public Ledger's syndicate, was one of the best of sev-
[162]
eral "working girl" strips that began in the late 1910s. It was the work of A. H. Hay-
ward, who was hired away from the New York Herald by the Ledger. The strip lasted
into the late 1940s.
Stumble Inn was another of George Herriman's early strips. See Krazy Kat.
[78-83]
Tarzan, Edgar Rice Burroughs's jungle lord—a
titled English heir raised from infancy by a
[429]
tribe of African great apes—entered the comics page via a daily illustration-and-text
strip rendered by Hal Foster in early 1928. Foster also did the Sunday version be-
tween 1931 and 1937, including the much celebrated "Lost Egyptians" sequence. See
Prince Valiant.
Terry and the Pirates began in late 1934, the work of Milton Caniff who revitalized the style of newspaper
[673-687]
adventure
strips with his effective use of impressionist graphic techniques and his
somewhat exotic adventure narrative. Caniff was born in Hillsboro, Ohio, in 1907. He
had done several features, most notably Dickie Dare, before approaching Captain
Joseph Patterson of the New York News with Terry. The
strip was his answer
to
Patterson's expressed desire for a "blood and thunder" suspense adventure strip "with
a juvenile angle." Terry was taken over by George Wunder when Caniff began Steve
Canyon in early 1947.
Texas Slim and Dirty Dalton,
a Sunday-only slapstick cowboy strip, was the work of Ferd Johnson, who otherwise
[740]
assisted Frank Willard on Moon Mullins
( and continued that latter strip after Wil-
lard's death )
. Johnson was bom in 1905 in Spring Creek, Pennsylvania, and was draw-
ing published cartoons before he entered high school. He attended the Chicago Aca-
demy of Fine Arts in 1923, but his
first job resulted from
his spending most of his
time hanging around the
cartoonist's desk at the Tribune, where he attracted Wil-
lard's sympathetic attention. Texas Slim began in 1925.
Thimble Theatre, by E. C. Segar, is one of the most celebrated comic-adventure strips. It began as Wil-
[443-474]
liam Randolph Hearst's idea of one way to replace his recently lost Minute Movies.
It was the work of Elzie Crisler Segar, bom
in Chester,
Illinois,
in
1894, the son
of a house painter. He diligently taught himself to draw, with the help of a cor-
respondence school course, and presented himself at the Chicago Herald, where he
got his first work. Once founded, Thimble Theatre developed a set of mnning char-
acters, chiefly the spinsterish Olive Oyl and her husthng brother. Castor. Popeye the
Sailor
first appeared in an adventure in January 1929, and immediately captivated
the strip's growing audience, as well as its author. A series of memorable adventures
and characters
(J. Wellington Wimpy, the Sea Hag, Alice the Goon, the Jeep)
fol-
lowed. Segar generally kept the story continuity in his daily episodes separate and
used his Sunday pages for self-contained gags. On the one occasion when he broke
with that practice, he produced the masterly "Plunder Island" adventure which
is
335

reproduced here. Segar died in late 1938. His feature has been continued since by
others, but usually with quite different intention and quality.
Toonerville Folks, Fontaine Fox, Jr.'s daily panel and Sunday strip on the engaging eccentrics who in-
[209-220; 442]
habited
his imaginary, then
still semirural suburbs, was begun in early 1915. The
vignettes of the trolley's Skipper, the tough kid Mickey "Himself" McGuire, the ter-
rible-tempered Mr. Bang, and the rest, lasted until 1955. Fo.\, born in 1884 in Louis-
ville, Kentucky, went to work for the Louisville Courier right out of high school, do-
ing reporting and cartoon work. He later briefly attended the University of Indiana,
but dropped out to become a full-time cartoonist.
Toonerville Folks began
in the
Chicago
Post before the Wheeler Syndicate distributed
it nationally. Fox died in
1964.
Tumbleweeds
is the work of Tom K. Ryan, born in Anderson, Indiana, in 1926, who always wanted
[750-751]
to be a cartoonist. He began in commercial art, read Western novels, and eventually
did a burlesque Western comic strip. Tumbleweeds began modestly in 1965 and has
built gradually in popularity since.
Wash Tubbs,
b\' Roy Crane, began as Washington Tubbs II in 1924. See Captain Easy.
[320-426]
White Boy
first appeared as a Sunday, half-page strip in the Chicago Tribune in 1933 and sub-
[440-441]
sequently also in the New York Daily News. The strip, initially concerning a white
youngster captured by an Indian tribe in the late nineteenth century, went through
several changes of focus, format, and even historical time. In them, fantasy narrative
switched to realism, switched to gags, and back again, possibly in efforts to appeal to
juvenile readers. The feature was the work of Garrett Price, best known for his illu-
strations for magazine fiction and his New Yorker cartoons. White Boy became SkuU
Valley toward the end and disappeared
in August
1936.
Price, bom
in Bucyrus,
Kansas, graduated from the University of Wyoming and the Art Institute of Chicago,
and continued art studies in France.
The Wizard
of Id
is the collaborative
effort of Brant Parker
(ideas and drawing) and Johnny Hart
[757]
(ideas).
Parker, a Californian born
in Los Angeles in 1920, was a Disney cartoonist
and later an illustrator for International Business Machines. He judged an art show
in Endicott, New York, that included the work of a highschooier named Johnny Hart
in the late 1940s and a friendship developed. The vaguely medieval Wizard first ap-
peared in 1964.

Bill Blackbeard
is the director of
tlio Sail Fran-
cisco Academy of Comic
Art, a nonprofit educa-
tional
institution devoted to the study of popu-
lar narrative
arts. Tlie
strips reproduced
in
this
collection were obtained from
its archives. Black-
beard
founded
the
academy
in
1967
in
the
course
of planning a book on
the comic
strip,
after discovering
to
his dismay that there were
only
a
few
books,
superficial
and
inadefjuatc,
existing
in
the
complex
comic-strip
field.
To
properly
prepare
his
work,
he
was
forced
to
create his own public research and study center,
accumulating what
is now
a
vast
collection
of
bound newspaper
files, popular
fiction and
car-
toon
periodicals,
books
in
all
genres
of
fiction
and
associated
background
data,
and
literally
millions of comic-strip episodes.
Blackbeard has written and edited extensively
in
the
narrative
arts
fields,
including many
ar-
ticles and books. He prepared a sizable number
of the entries in the recent World Encyclopedia
of Comics (Chelsea House). Blackbeard
is now
editing a series of fifty or more reprint volumes
of
classic comic
strips
in
complete
sequences,
starting with
the
earliest
daily
strips
of worth
( Hyperion Press ), and
is also preparing a factual
and critical history of the comic strips
( Oxford )
for which much
of the contents
of
this
Smith-
sonian volume will serve as illustration.
Martin Williams
has
been
an
English
teacher
(Columbia
University)
aiKl book editor (Mac-
millan), but most of his time has been spent as
a
critic of the popular and performing
arts. He
has written on
literature
(including children's),
theater, films, radio, television—and comic strips.
Chiefly, his work has been in jazz. As editor, his
books
include
Tlw
Art
of
Jazz
(Oxford)
and
Jazz Panorama (Collier); as author, Where's the
Melody?
A
Listener's
Introduction
to
Jazz
( Pantheon )
; Jazz Masters of New Orleans
( Mac-
millan )
; The Jazz Tradition
( Oxford
)
; and Jazz
in
Transition
(Macmillan). He
has
written on
jazz
for
dozens
of
magazines
and
newspapers
and was for nine years the regular jazz critic for
the Saturday Review.
Since 1971 Williams has been the director of
the Jazz and
Popular Culture Program
of
the
Division of Performing Arts, Smithsonian Institu-
tion,
where
he
produced
the much
acclaimed
record
album
The
Smithsonian
Collection
of
Classic Jazz.
Needless
to
say,
Williams
is
also
a
comics
aficionado.
