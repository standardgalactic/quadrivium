Chapter 1 ■ Setup
2
The Magento platform is constantly changing, so it is impossible to create a book that 
will cover all of its aspects. Therefore, go to the Firebear blog9 and sign up for updates. All 
the latest news, reviews, and advice on Magento 1 and Magento 2 are available there.
The next thing I’d like to mention is the release of Magento 2. Although the 
new version of the ecommerce platform offers a plethora of improvements, it won’t 
outperform 1.x within the next few years. This time is required for the creation of an 
ecosystem with all the necessary extensions, themes, third-party software solutions, and 
developers. Thus, I recommend that you start your ecommerce business with the latest 
available version of Magento 1.x, as it is the most robust tool for online retail. When 
Magento 2 is mature, you will be able to migrate from your current version without any 
headaches.
As for Magento setup, it is a very complex procedure that starts with downloading 
and installation. Then you should set up the server and hosting. The next two big stages 
are related to the proper use of templates and extensions. Once you have completed these 
steps, you can start importing product and other data into your new website.
At this point, you have a complete ecommerce store, but it is still far from launch. 
The next essential stages include performance improvements, security implementation, 
and SEO optimization. If you think that it is the end of the setup procedure, however, you 
are mistaken. The last important step is a pre-launch.
In this chapter, I show you how to pass all the aforementioned stages with maximum 
efficiency, and at the same time, with minimal headaches. Let’s start with downloading 
and installation.
Downloading and Installation
When it comes to the Magento download, you should first check the official source at 
https://goo.gl/IdSktD.
On this page, you will find the latest version of Magento Community Edition, the 
open source ecommerce platform. It also has the latest patches, which you should 
download and install separately. That’s why I also recommend checking FireGento’s 
GitHub mirrors with the latest patched version of the platform at https://goo.gl/
fssCe6. It already includes all the patches and improvements. The benefit is obvious: you 
have a single installation and download procedure combined instead of two separate 
processes.
When you know where Magento Community Edition is situated, I can tell you a few 
useful things about the installation. You can utilize local hosting during development (it is 
described next). It helps you to reduce costs and get the necessary experience. According 
to the official guide (you can find it here: http://goo.gl/wwVZZm), you need to create the 
prerequisites found here: http://goo.gl/4bls9m.
You should also set up your server. I appeal to the official guide once more:  
http://goo.gl/EJvYwA.
Now you can run the installation procedure; see http://goo.gl/Pp0Zzq.

Chapter 1 ■ Setup
3
Be proud of yourself. You’ve just installed Magento! Your ecommerce website is still 
far from being finished, but one of the most responsible and complicated stages is already 
behind you. If you have any questions, I recommend checking the following resources:
• 
Official wiki (http://goo.gl/PSveyi)
• 
Official forums (http://goo.gl/jn27KR)
• 
Magento Stack Exchange (http://goo.gl/u87Uer)
• 
The official resource list (http://goo.gl/A5KL1Y)
You can also read more about the Magento community on Firebear Studio10, “The 
power of Real Magento Community,” at http://goo.gl/sznMw1.
And of course, I’d like to mention the official Magento user guide. The Magento 
Community Edition User Guide should be your number-one handbook. You can find 
information on it at http://goo.gl/VpV5dm.
Server/Hosting
In this part of the chapter, I tell you about the crucial aspects of the Magento setup, such 
as the server and hosting. Here, you will find the best solutions optimized for Magento.
Good Magento optimized hosting guarantees a fast and stable store. In the article at 
http://goo.gl/hNXFnO you can find the best 16 solutions optimized for Magento, but I 
recommend that you pay attention to Nexcess.
Nexcess (https://goo.gl/8NeYTe) offers secure, stable, and scalable built-in hosting 
solutions for Magento. The company provides several solutions called the Secure Isolated 
Platform (SIP). Each SIP is a fine-tuned, self-contained ecommerce hosting environment. 
Each platform includes a ready-to-launch optimized Magento website. Nexcess provides 
complete Magento hosting options only in the United States, the United Kingdom, and 
Australia. But it is still a reliable solution for other regions.
The cheapest solution is SIP 100. Its price starts at $19.95 per month if you pay for the 
whole year, but if you pay monthly, an additional $5 per month are charged. SIP 100 offers 
2x Quad Core E5620, 7.5GB of free space, 16GB RAM, 75GB of data per month, one IP, 
nine additional stores, and 30 accounts per server.
I recommend that you not waste time and use SIP 200 instead, as it is the most 
powerful and reliable Magento-optimized server solution, at $75 per month. It provides 
enough resources for running a robust mid-sized ecommerce store. You can launch 
demos of all the proposed platforms to compare with other Nexcess solutions, but SIP 200 
is the optimum solution.
CloudWays11 offers reliable cloud hosting that is optimized for Magento. Being both 
fast and secure, it offers the following features:
• 
Installation focused on performance
• 
The ability to install unlimited number of websites

• 
Daily managed backups
• 
Dedicated servers
• 
Firewall
• 
Reliable support and monitoring 24/7
• 
Git and SSL
The cheapest plan starts at $5 per month.
EboundHost12 offers managed Magento-dedicated servers. The cheapest CE server 
costs $99 per month and offers Intel Xeon E5-2630; 50GB SSD (RAID) 4 CPU Cores, 4GB 
of RAM, and JetRails™ Lite. EboundHost provides 24/7 support, lightning-fast SSD storage, 
and various optimizations specific to Magento.
Local Hosting
Local Magento web development is another important step in your ecommerce setup. 
With local hosting, you can install Apache, PHP, MySQL, and other useful tools right on 
your computer and use it like a web server. Thus, you will be able to install a Magento 
store right on your PC. You just need one of the following tools.
These are the benefits of local hosting:
• 
First, you can get enough practical skills before releasing your 
store on hosting.
• 
Second, an essential aspect is the ability to reduce costs required 
during development, as you don’t need hosting during this stage.
MAMP (https://goo.gl/k5HAxM) provides a bunch of technologies composed of 
free, open source, and proprietary commercial solutions. MAMP is the acronym for Mac 
OS X (but it also works on Windows), Apache, MySQL, and PHP, Python, and Perl. The 
solution is based on a similar software set for Linux, called LAMP. There are also various 
AMP packages for different operating systems. MAMP is designed for all CMS platforms, 
so you can set up a local development environment with ease. You can get MAMP for free; 
the Pro version costs EUR 39.00.
XAMPP (https://goo.gl/qRNcm3) is a free and open source cross-platform web 
server solution that consists of Apache HTTP Server, MySQL database, and scripts 
interpreters written in PHP and Perl. The X means cross-platform. The development 
tool allows programmers to test their projects on computers without any Internet access 
by creating a corresponding development environment. In addition, XAMPP provides 
support for creating databases in SQLite and MySQL. You can download XAMPP for 
Windows, OS X, and Linux.

Magento Templates
Magento themes and templates offer a huge boon to your online business. By installing 
the correct product, you will provide your customers with a rich shopping experience. 
Created by professional and experienced web designers and developers, Magento themes 
and templates can bring your online store to an absolutely new level.
A good design increases the conversion rate, turns visitors into buyers, and buyers 
into regular customers. That’s why it is important to understand the latest design trends: 
this knowledge will help you choose the right template. Note that template developers 
often provide support. It can be both free or paid, so you should check the information on 
every template.
I wouldn’t recommend that you create your own template, because it is 
unreasonably expensive. You can utilize the existing templates instead, since it is possible 
to enhance them with corporate identity features related to your business. So what are the 
best sources of Magento themes and templates?
There are numerous theme marketplaces all over the Internet. You can spend days 
searching for the right source of content. Therefore it is necessary to know the major 
websites with themes and templates. They are all listed next.
Marketplaces
ThemeForest is the number-one marketplace for themes and templates. It offers 
premium content for Magento and other platforms. You can easily build your ecommerce 
store after having visited this marketplace, as ThemeForest offers more than 500 different 
Magento templates and themes.

Another reliable source of Magento templates is TemplateMonster. There are dozens 
of different ecommerce themes and templates within this marketplace. TemplateMonster 
provides its customers the ability to choose between different categories. Of course, this 
feature is also available at ThemeForest, but TemplateMonster provides more precise 
search options.

Top eCommerce Website Design Trends
Every successful ecommerce web developer or ecommerce website designer tries to 
follow the top web design trends. As an ecommerce store owner, you should do this 
because understanding the latest innovations is also crucial for your business growth. 
Everyone benefits from following the new standards: developers and designers provide 
competitive services and produce high-quality websites; ecommerce website owners get 
a better understanding of how to catch new customers and make the existing audience 
more loyal. Next, I tell you about the top ecommerce website design trends of 2015, so 
get ready for a long journey into the world of innovation. After reading this part of the 
chapter, you will be able to select a Magento template that will become the best solution 
for your ecommerce needs.
New Requirements for the Responsive Design
Responsive design is among the most essential elements of web design. Thousands 
of different smartphones, tablets, and phablets require a unique approach to provide 
Figure 1-1.  Magento Connect

customers with maximum accessibility on whatever devices they use. The difference 
between 2015 and previous years is in the appearance of new devices and platforms. 
Smart watches and home appliances, smart TVs, and smart glasses make the definition of 
responsive design much broader than before.
Scrolling over Clicking
With the popularization of smartphones and tablets, scrolling became more popular than 
clicking. Compared to clicking, it is more convenient and takes less time for a page to load 
because you get everything within one page and don’t need to open additional elements 
on new pages. Thus, scrolling also provides users with the ability to get all the information 
they need without any unnecessary actions on additional screens and windows.
The Importance of Typography
Content was always extremely important, but every year customers, search engines, and 
competition provide stricter requirements and new trends. It is obvious that in 2015, 
typography will play a more essential role in ecommerce website design. Simplicity, 
bold elements, and large images are going to be among dominating design trends this 
year. We can even speak of responsive typography,” a new approach to typography with 
strong emphasis on a responsive design. Typographic flexibility and webkits are other key 
features of typography as an ecommerce website design trend.
Ghost Buttons
Ghost buttons have a chance to become a new favorite web element. They are nice, 
minimal, and useful. Ghost buttons look good and attract shopper’s attention in a subtle 
way. They are not really a call to action but a useful addition to every ecommerce website. 
You can see the example of ghost buttons in the image (Mission, Play, Touch).
Material Design by Google
Mobile commerce also has its own trends. Material design is a design direction that 
Google implemented. It relies on skeuomorphism and entirely flat design. Material design 
covers different platforms and has its influence on ecommerce website design.
Microinteractions
“Microinteractions are contained product moments that revolve around a single use 
case—they have one main task. Every time you change a setting, sync your devices, set an 
alarm, log in, or “like” something, you are engaging with a microinteraction.” They revolve 

Chapter 1 ■ Setup

around a single use case, when a customer interacts with a website. Microinteractions 
are incorporated in the improvement of customer engagement. During 2015, we will see 
more useful and sophisticated microinteractions.
Card Design
Card design is an integral part of responsive websites. The card approach to ecommerce 
website design provides the ability to organize and arrange things more effectively. In 
addition, cards allow visitors to get more information easier than any other solutions. 
Card design is simple, clear, and informative.
Background Images and Videos
The background is always among the most attractive parts of every website. Keep in mind 
that great content looks better over a stunning background image. That’s why background 
images and videos are always important. They have become a trend with ecommerce 
website design.
Hidden Menus
The popularization of mobile devices has a great influence on the design of websites. 
Because of small screens, smartphones require some site elements to be hidden, but a 
user can always reach them. That’s why global or product navigation is absent in its full 
size until you hit a special button. Thus, hidden menus are becoming more popular. 
These elements are widely used, even on relatively larger screens. Still, many people 
don’t understand the meaning of hamburger menu icon, so there is a possibility that 
ecommerce website designers will use it in a tandem with the word menu.
Large Photography
Large images always had a negative impact on the site speed, so website designers tried to 
avoid using them in recent years. But everything has changed with an improved responsive 
design. New techniques and adaptive images make it possible to serve fast-loading even 
with large images. Of course, better content can help ecommerce websites sell more; 
therefore, the community expects larger images on home and product detail pages.
Nearly Flat Design
Thanks to Google, Apple, and Microsoft flat design occupied major mobile platforms. Of 
course, this idea isn’t new, but it is fresh for ecommerce websites. The trend continues to 
expand its influence, because flat design is more pleasing to the customers and easier to 
understand, develop, and make it responsive. Another advantage of the flat design is the 
focus towards the content. The core principles of skeuomorphism make such elements as 
call-to-action buttons unobtrusive. The same holds for the use of shadows. With the flat

design, ecommerce web developers can bring an element to the front of the screen and 
make it an integral part of the site. The “less is more” principle continues to enhance its 
influence, becoming one of the leading ecommerce website design trends.
Device Agnostic
Modern ecommerce website should be device agnostic. It’s unacceptable to design web 
pages for particular devices. They must function properly on all screen sizes. Today, 
ecommerce web developers must take into account the amount of screen resolution 
variations, all the possible input methods, connection speeds, and browser requirements 
to create a universal experience for every visitor. With device-agnostic design visitors will 
leave the ecommerce website wanting to return. Users will be able to navigate through the 
site and complete the checkout without any need to pinch the screen or aim at buttons.
Tile Navigation
Images always were more time-saving and captivating than text boxes. The “less is more” 
principle lies at the heart of modern navigation. Instead of the standard bar, ecommerce 
websites are implementing tile navigation. By using image tiles instead of lists, web 
designers provide users with a preview of what they’re going to see. Keep in mind that 
tile navigation is more user-friendly than any ordinary solution. It has a huge potential to 
grab the attention of visitors after the first few seconds of interaction with an ecommerce 
website. Tailed navigation recreates the feel of walking into a brick and mortar store, so 
visitors stay entertained as long as possible.
Parallax Scrolling
You have probably already seen websites with tantalizing background animation or 
parallax effect. It can be very impressive, but there is a problem when parallax turns 
into distraction. The ecommerce website loses its main goal, and instead of presenting 
products it demonstrates impressive design effects. Keep in mind that design should be 
beautiful and at the same time useful. Animations, images, and effects should support 
sales, not overshadow products.
The following websites provide examples of the most inspiring ecommerce web 
designs. They illustrate the most modern, beautiful, and practical solutions.

Now, when you are familiar with ecommerce design trends and know major 
marketplaces, you can look for the Magento template, but don’t spend too much time on 
choosing the right solution, next I will tell you about the must-have extensions and how to 
install them.

Magento Extensions
Developing Magento extensions is not for everyone, but regardless of coding experience 
everyone can utilize the end product of this complicated process. It’s just important to 
know which Magento extensions to choose and how to install them correctly. Next, I 
cover the best Magento modules and teach how to install them. The modules are divided 
into six groups: performance, SEO, front end, UI, usability, loyalty and referral campaigns, 
system back end, and marketing and sales. The installation procedure is described in 
three different ways: via Magento Connect, FTP, and SSH.
You can get a free support with paid extensions. Such services often have time limits, 
but you can always get a consultation from specialists. Don’t be afraid to ask them!
But why do we use extensions?
Extensions
Magento extensions or modules offer tons of extra features and opportunities. Magento 
provides a lot (out of the box), but the default functionality is not enough for running a 
successful ecommerce business. That’s why there are tons of both paid and free modules 
on Magento Connect, GitHub, and other websites. The following extensions introduce the 
basic level of improvements. They are just an example of what to use. Of course, you can 
choose your own modules.
The Magento extensions described next are not enough for receiving the maximum 
return from your ecommerce website. Check the other sections of this chapter to find out 
how more reliable improvements look like. For instance, there are sections dedicated to 
SEO and performance.
Performance
Being a part of customer relationships, good performance is the key to a growing 
revenue and profit. This significant aspect positively affects customer loyalty and search 
engines ranking, and as a result your cash flows. You can improve your Magento store 
performance by using proper settings and extensions.
If Magento store is not set up correctly, it becomes slow and alienates customers. 
Sometimes even experienced web developers could miss some settings, so it is necessary 
to monitor if everything is set up correctly. The probability for correct settings can be 
increased with the help of extensions. Several correct extensions can dramatically change 
the speed of your Magento store. The most reliable solutions will be discussed next.
Fooman Speedster is your performance tool number one. It combines multiple 
JavaScript files into a single one. The same holds also CSS files. As a result, you get shorter 
page load time. The other feature of the Fooman Speedster extension is the ability to 
reduce the total size of all the files required for loading empty and primed caches. In 
addition, Fooman Speedster reduces the number of HTTP requests. The extension 
doesn’t require any gzip support on the server; therefore, all files are compressed without 
any additional tunings. Fooman Speedster is fully automated, supports multistore 
capabilities, and uses the Minify library. You can install Fooman Speedster here for free.

Lesti::Fpc is another useful module designed for performance improvements. It is an 
internal full page cache for Magento, which works with events. One of the most important 
features of Lesti::Fpc is its simplicity: the extension doesn’t need any external software. 
Being an internal cache, Lesti::Fpc replaces dynamic blocks before sending a response to 
a customer. You can find more information on the extension and install Lesti::Fpc here.

CloudFlare is a world-leading content delivery network that is optimized for 
Magento. With the Control for CloudFlare Magento extension, you are able to integrate 
your store with this service. As a result, dozens of JavaScript, CSS, and image files 
loaded from your server during every page view (even if you use Full Page Cache and 
minification) are loaded from distributed servers around the world. This will dramatically 
reduce server load and provide your customers with an amazing page load speed. 
The additional features of this extension include resource caching, DDoS protection, 
additional forms and files security, and async JS load. You can download the Magento 
extension here: Control for CloudFlare. And don’t forget to check CloudFlare’s plans. 
There is a free one.
SEO
According to Wikipedia, SEO is the process of affecting the visibility of a website in a 
search engine’s organic search results. The earlier and the more frequently your Magento 
store appears in the list of search results, the more visitors come to your website. That 
is why SEO optimization is crucial for your ecommerce business. There is a SEO guide 
discussed in this chapter, but nevertheless, at this point I will explicitly discuss the key 
SEO extensions. Magento is SEO-friendly right out of the box, but you can always enhance 
the default capabilities with the help of proper modules.
Creare SEO for Magento adds a lot of new features to your ecommerce Magento 
store. By installing this extension, you will enhance your website with the following 
features: HTML sitemap; Noindex on category filters; unique category headings; default 
metadescriptions and page titles for products and categories; config-editable .htaccess 
and robots.txt; 301 redirects for discontinued products; Twitter cards for product pages; 
the ability to disable keywords and metadescription tags; an SEO checking page in 
the admin; a performance cleanup script; a breadcrumbs schema; XML sitemap fix; 
canonical product redirect; a product attribute validator; and duplicate product button 
removal. You can install Creare SEO for free here.

Schema.org is another must-have tool for SEO optimization. The extension 
adds metadata to the product pages of your ecommerce store. The product name, its 
description, price, stock status, ratings, and a non-cached image path are used in addition 
to the default information about every product page of your website. The extension is 
compatible with such search engines as Google, Bing, and Yahoo!. Check this page for 
additional information.
With SEO Pagination extension, you can provide search engines the ability 
to properly understand the structure of your Magento store. This leads to a higher 
keyword ranking in search results. The extension allows you to implement Google 
recommendations to target pagination issues in SEO with rel="prev" and rel="next" 
markup tags. It means that the category pages of your Magento store will be optimized 
for most search engines robots. Having installed the extension, search engines will 
receive a strong hint to treat pagination within the category pages as a logical sequence. 
By providing search engines with the information on how to work with the pages of your 
webstore, SEO Pagination helps to avoid duplicate content issues. You can download SEO 
Pagination here.

Front End, UI, Usability
The front end, user interface, and overall usability are closely related. Since the front end 
is responsible for collecting data from the visitors, think of it as of an interface between 
your customers and the back end. The user interface is the place where interaction 
between customers and the store occurs. As you can see, front end and UI are closely 
connected and have significant influence on overall usability. By using the following 
extensions, you can improve the front end, the UI, and the usability of your Magento 
store. The following modules are designed to improve the usability of your ecommerce 
store. They add lots of new features, making the user experience better.
One Page Checkout Magento module significantly reduces the steps required 
during the checkout. In ecommerce, fewer steps mean that your customers are more 
likely to complete the full checkout process. Thus, One Page Checkout extension allows 
users to checkout without any hesitation. Moreover, the extension provides numerous 
configurations, so the new checkout process can be modified to fit your webstore needs. 
Learn more about One Page Checkout.
Social Connect is another important Magento extension. It adds Google, Facebook, 
and Twitter buttons to your login page. As a result, customers experience a much faster 
login and registration options. They just have to hit one button to complete login or 
registration. Information from their Google, Facebook, or Twitter accounts is used. 
Thus, the overall process becomes easier and dramatically faster. You can find more 
information about Social Connect Magento extension here.

Toogas Featured Popup extension provides you with fully customizable options for 
pop-ups. All of these options appear in Magento’s admin. With this module, you make 
the pop-up windows within your ecommerce store nice and friendly. The corresponding 
image and its dimensions, the associated store views, and several other settings, such as 
opacity and priority, are offered by this extension. Toogas Featured Popup is absolutely 
free and you can download it here.

Improved Navigation: the name of this extension speaks for itself. The default 
navigation within Magento store is far from being top-notch, but with Improved 
Navigation by Amasty you will make your store much more user-friendly. Your customers 
will easily find the way from the main page of your Magento store to the products they are 
looking for. Thus, you will be able to increase revenue and customers loyalty. Improved 
Navigation offers such features as SEO-layered and Ajax-layered navigation, navigation 
filters, advanced menu categories, price slider, and so forth. For additional information,

Loyalty and Referral Campaigns
It is extremely important to increase visitor loyalty to turn buyers into returning 
customers and create buzz within social networks. When different stores sell similar 
products, loyalty means almost everything, since the growing loyalty paves the way to 
an increase in sales. Posts from random users on Facebook or Twitter have become one 
of the most trusted forms of advertising. Thus, there is no question of whether to start a 
referral campaign. The question is how to do it with maximum output. I recommend that 
you begin with the following extensions.
Sweet Tooth Loyalty and Reward Points Magento extension provides you with the 
ability to create reward points programs developed to increase loyalty, and as a result, 
sales. Sweet Tooth offers tons of customizations and unique features. You will be able to 
turn your visitors into buyers, buyers into returning customers, and returning customers 
into brand advocates that bring friends to your ecommerce store. Note that Sweet Tooth is 
available on a monthly subscription basis. For additional information, go here.

Refer a Friend by aheadWorks is another reliable tool when it comes to loyalty and 
referral campaigns. As you might have guessed by its name, it is established to stimulate 
customers to invite other people to your ecommerce website. A buyer gets a reward for 
every new invited customer. It can be a percentage or flat discount on a purchase. While 
you are getting new customers, your revenue is growing. You can get more information

There are also some extensions developed for system and back-end enhancements. 
Usually, they simplify the work of administrators, providing some new features and extra 
customizations. As a result, you spend less time on different routine processes. Thus, you 
can concentrate on other vital aspects of your ecommerce business. Next, I show you the 
most reliable solutions, which can make the back end of your store better.

customization options for most admin grids. As a result, administrators receive many new 
useful features, new columns, and a powerful editor. The module provides the ability to 
edit values directly in grids, shows hidden columns, and offers several rendering options. 
With the Enhanced Admin Grids Magento extension, you are able to customize such 
column base values as header, width, and alignment. Moreover, the module’s drag-n-

Installation
Congratulations! Now you know which extensions to install, so it’s time to show you how 
to do it. Next, I have described three different types of installation. The second one is 
the easiest, but it can only be used with free extensions. The other installations are more 
complex, but that shouldn’t frighten you. Let’s start with a manual installation via FTP.
How to Install Magento Extensions Manually via FTP (Six 
Universal Steps and Troubleshooting)
The following FTP (File Transfer Protocol) guide is designed for basic webserver setup: 
MySQL, Apache, and PHP. For a server with a more advanced setup, you have to adjust 
these steps. Ask your system admin about the details. You can also automate the 
installation process with the help of a command-line equivalent.
I strongly recommend that you use a test site to install modules. You might get into 
trouble even with the best Magento extensions, so you should check how they work 
without doing any harm to your live store. Therefore, install your modules in a test 
environment first. If everything is OK, repeat the installation on a live site.
Now I’ll explain how to install Magento extensions while avoiding Magento Connect. 
I have described the most common problems with a manual installation and show how to 
fix them. The following are the six universal FTP steps:
	
1.	
Turn off compilation.
	
2.	
Turn on cache.
	
3.	
Perform installation.

Chapter 1 ■ Setup

4.	
Refresh cache.
	
5.	
Re-enter back end.
	
6.	
Turn on compilation.
Turn off Compilation
If your Magento compilation mode is enabled, you have to turn it off; otherwise, your 
ecommerce store and its admin could be inaccessible after you install an extension. To 
disable the Magento compilation procedure, go to System ➤ Tools ➤ Compilation.
If you prefer working with the command line, you should use this equivalent:
1   php -f shell/compiler.php -- clear
In addition, I recommend that you create a backup of all Magento files. Thus when 
something goes wrong, you will be able to fix all problems with ease. You can also refresh 
the cache and check if your website works well. Don’t start the installation if there are 
issues with your ecommerce website.
An optional step is a database backup. You should create it for additional safety 
purposes. You can take your website offline or keep it live. In the second case, you will 
have to re-add orders manually after you create the backup.
Turn on Cache
Now, you have to turn on the configuration cache to prevent an early installation, as it 
could be the reason of errors. Go to System ➤ Cache Management.
Perform Installation
When you’ve found an extension that is necessary for your ecommerce website, you have 
to read its installation instructions first. That way, you get all the essential information for 
a successful installation. Don’t ignore this advice.
When you know all the nuances, you can download a Magento extension and unzip 
it into a separate folder.
You have to upload the unzipped content to a server via SFTP or FTP. Connect to 
your Magento server. Go to the root directory. Upload the appropriate files to the root 
folder. The root folder includes such subfolders as app, downloader, errors, and so forth.
One of the best free FTP tools is Filezilla. You can freely use it to simplify the installation.
Note that the uploaded files have to be readable by a web server. This means that 
they must have the same permissions as the existing ones.
Refresh Cache
Now you should go to System ➤ Cache Management once again and refresh Magento’s cache. 
This step is necessary for providing Magento with the ability to register a new extension.

Chapter 1 ■ Setup
31
Re-enter the Back End
To prevent the Access Denied error, you have to re-enter the back end. Log in with a full 
administrator account to get new permissions.
Check whether your ecommerce website works as always. If you’ve turned off the 
store, you should bring it online.
Turn on Compilation
If you are using the compilation mode, which was previously disabled, you have to turn it 
on. Go to System ➤ Tools ➤ Compilation and hit the Run Compilation Process button.
You could also use the command line instead:
1   php -f shell/compiler.php -- compile
■
■Warning!  In order to prevent potential conflicts, you have to install only one extension 
at a time.
Troubleshooting
Next, I explain how to fix the most common errors related to the Magento extension 
installation.
I have done everything as described but I can’t find my extension.
There is a possibility that Magento will not be able to read the Name.xml file, which has to 
be associated with the module’s name or developer.
	
1.	
First, check System ➤ Configuration ➤ Advanced ➤ Disable 
Modules Output. If the extension is not there, you have two 
more ways to fix the problem.
	
2.	
Check the permissions of the uploaded files one more time. 
They must be readable by Magento.
	
3.	
Flush the cache and delete the contents of var/cache (in rare 
cases, this content can be cached in the tmp/ folder).
An error page with a reference number at the bottom occurs.
This number corresponds to a file from a server. The file is situated in <MAGENTO_- 
ROOT_FOLDER>/var/report/.
To get more information about the error, you have to open this file. If files from the 
includes/src folder are mentioned in the report, it’s likely that you’ve failed in the first 
step of the guide. Now you do not have an access to your admin.
Luckily, you can fix the problem by editing the includes/config.php file. Change the 
following:

Chapter 1 ■ Setup
32
1   define('COMPILER_INCLUDE_PATH', dirname(      FILE   ).DIRECTORY_
SEPARATOR.'src');
to this:
1   #define('COMPILER_INCLUDE_PATH', dirname(__FILE__).DIRECTORY_
SEPARATOR.'src');
The Magento back end should be functional again, so you can rerun the compilation 
process, as described in the sixth step.
If this doesn’t help, contact the extension developer.
I’ve refreshed the cache but there are still no new configuration options
Once again, check whether Magento can read the permissions of the uploaded files. Flush 
the cache and delete the contents of var/cache.
I see a white page after the installation
This is a fatal error that occurred while the page was loading. You have to check the 
details of this problem in the server’s error log. It is often necessary to contact the 
extension developers and show them this log in order to fix the issue.
How to Disable a New Extension
The following explains how to disable a new extension.
	
1.	
Go to the app/etc/modules folder.
	
2.	
Change the file name ending .xml in 
<companyname>_<extensionname>.xml to .off, 
for instance. You should get the following result: 
<companyname>_<extensionname>.off.
	
3.	
Refresh the Magento cache. Go to the var/cache folder and 
delete its content.
You can always re-enable an extension by renaming the file name to end with .xml. 
Take into account that the Disable Modules Output option disables a block output only, 
so uninstall extensions in a proper way.
Now you know how to install extensions via FTP. As you can see, this process is  
not difficult, but it requires some attention. Next, I discuss an even simpler  
procedure—installation via Magento Connect.

Chapter 1 ■ Setup
33
How to Install Free Extensions via Magento Connect
Please note that you must use the previous guide for commercial extensions.
Some specialists don’t recommend using Magento Connect. Although it is the 
easiest way to install an extension, there are several drawbacks:
• 
By using the same key at different installations, you can install the 
wrong version of a module.
• 
It is unsafe to use Magento Connect Downloader with the 777 
permission.
• 
You don’t have any ability to inspect code.
• 
By using Magento Connect Manager, you can accidentally trigger 
the upgrade of the Magento core.
If these aspects don’t deter you, then you should perform the following steps:
	
1.	
Go to the profile of a preferred extension.
	
2.	
Check supported versions of the platform.
	
3.	
Select your platform (e.g., Community).
	
4.	
Hit the Install Now button.
	
5.	
Choose the Magento Connect channel: 1.0 for Magento CE 
1.4.x and below; 2.0 for Magento CE 1.4.2.0 beta; CE 1.5+; EE 
1.9.0.0-RC2+.
	
6.	
Don’t forget to check the license agreement box.
	
7.	
Get an extension key.
	
8.	
Copy the key by clicking Select Key.
	
9.	
Log in to the admin of your Magento store.
	
10.	
Go to System ➤ Magento Connect ➤ Magento Connect 
Manager.
	
11.	
Paste the key into the appropriate field.
	
12.	
Click the Install button.
	
13.	
Now you can cancel or proceed to the installation. Click 
Proceed.
	
14.	
A console box will appear. It shows the installation process 
and displays issues (if there are any).
	
15.	
Hit the Refresh button to finish the installation.

Chapter 1 ■ Setup
34
Troubleshooting
If there is any trouble with the Magento Connect Manager installation, you should make 
sure that the correct extension key was used. Stability is another discrepancy factor. It is 
impossible to install beta extensions if your system is set to Stable. The following explains 
how you should change your stability settings in Manager:
	
1.	
Go to your admin panel and choose System ➤ Configuration.
	
2.	
Enter your Magento Connect account.
	
3.	
Hit Settings.
	
4.	
Choose the necessary option from the pull-down menu.
	
5.	
You can select among stable, alpha, or beta.
	
6.	
Click Save.
Read the Magento Connect FAQ for help with other issues and troubleshooting. That 
was easy. Follow these steps for uninstallation:
	
1.	
Open the Magento Connect Manager.
	
2.	
Go to the Manage Existing Connections section.
	
3.	
Choose an extension.
	
4.	
Choose Uninstall from the drop-down menu under the 
Actions column.
	
5.	
Hit the Commit Changes button.
	
6.	
End the process with the help of Refresh.
Next, I shed light on more complicated methods. The previous two are enough for 
running an ecommerce store successfully, so you can skip the following guides. If you 
want to get more advanced knowledge, see the following tutorials.
How to Install Magento Extensions via SSH
Another installation method is based on using SSH (Secure Shell). It is a little 
complicated, but you can still utilize it.
	
1.	
Go to the directory with your installed Magento.
	
2.	
Run these commands:
1   chmod +x mage
2   ./mage mage-setup .
3   ./mage config-set preferred_state stable
4   ./mage install http://connect20.magentocommerce.com/REPO PACKAGE_NAME

Chapter 1 ■ Setup
35
Note that you must replace REPO and PACKAGE_NAME with values related to your 
extension.
For Magento 1.4.x or earlier use the following commands:
1   chmod +x pear
2   ./pear mage-setup .
3   ./pear config-set preferred_state stable
4   ./pear install EXTENSION_KEY
You have to change EXTENSION_KEY with a new value related to your extension.
■
■Warning!  It is required to install core Magento extensions for Magento 1.4.x or earlier 
versions of the platform; otherwise, Magento will upgrade your ecommerce website to the 
latest version.
You can use Magento Connect to check if core Magento extensions are installed. Just 
log in to get this information.
How to Install Magento Extensions with Composer
I also recommend that you check these tools because they significantly simplify the 
installation: Magento Composer Installer and Composer Installers.
The purpose of Magento Composer Installer is to enable Composer to install 
modules and integrate them into a Magento installation automatically. It adds 
Composer’s vendor autoloader ability; as a result, Composer-compatible third-party tools 
can be used. Read about the project here: Magento Composer Installer25.
Another useful tool is Composer Installers. You can examine it here: Composer 
Installers26. Composer Installers also simplifies your daily routine by installing extensions 
or modules on Magento.
If the aforementioned information is not enough, check these manuals on module 
installation:

Payment Gateways
It’s obvious that an ecommerce website should support online payments, but what 
payment gateways suite best for the needs of your business? There are hundreds of online 
payment services on the Internet, so it is difficult to choose a right one. Therefore, I will 
teach you how to select a payment gateway for your business.
It’s critical to understand all nuances related to online payment processing so that 
you get a solution that is the most suitable for your ecommerce business.
• 
Payment gateways and merchant accounts. A payment gateway 
approves or declines payments. A merchant account is a place 
where your money is held before being transferred into a bank 
account. There are services that provide both tools within one 
platform, and there are companies that offer only one solution.
• 
Different types of checkout. There are several types of payment 
gateways. Hosted solutions are gateways that take your customer 
out of your website during the checkout. Non-hosted solutions 
let your buyers stay in your store while entering credit card 
information. In order to cover the needs of all of your customers, 
you should offer both solutions.
• 
Fees and payments. Every credit card payment gateway 
charges a different amount of money for its implementation. 
There are three major types of fees: setup fees, monthly fees, 
and transactional fees. Some payment services charge only 
transaction fees, whereas others try to gather as much money as 
possible. Thus, it is important to know all the fees in the payment 
gateway of your choice.
• 
Anti-fraud protection. Unfortunately, there are gateways without 
strong antifraud protection. Take into consideration that these 
payment solutions are not secure. You should choose gateways 
that provide data encryption and allow CVV2 verification.
• 
Payment methods. Some gateways are limited to certain 
payment methods. You should always check if they provide 
payment methods that are common within your target market.
• 
Prohibited items. Please note that there can be a prohibited 
items list in every payment gateway. If you sell products from this 
list, the gateway will not work on your ecommerce website.
• 
High-risk businesses. Features such as high-risk credit card 
processing or high-risk merchant account maintenance are not 
provided by all gateways. If you operate in gambling, ebooks, 
electronic cigarettes, adult content, or other risky sectors, you 
should check if the chosen payment service will work on your 
website.

Chapter 1 ■ Setup
37
• 
Payment turnarounds. You don’t want to spend several days 
waiting for your money, right? That’s why you should check 
payment turnaround. Ideal gateways provide a rapid payment 
turnaround time, but be prepared for more realistic solutions.
• 
Chargebacks. Chances are that your customers will request 
chargebacks from time to time. Thus, you should be able to 
provide them with this opportunity. Keep in mind that this feature 
must be supported by your payment gateway; otherwise, you will 
experience a lot of unnecessary issues.
• 
Customer support. Imagine a situation where you have a 
problem that should be solved immediately, but appropriate 
customer support doesn’t work. This situation could lead to 
money loss or even a spoiled reputation, so 24/7 customer service 
is a must.
• 
Localization. Localization is also vital. Some gateways support 
multiple languages and currencies, whereas others provide 
limited opportunities. If your business provides localization, you 
should offer the same conditions during the checkout. That’s why 
you need a payment solution that supports localization.
• 
Scalability. Please note that some ecommerce payment gateways 
have limited transactions and other restrictions. Thus, they can 
be used with small businesses only. Check whether your chosen 
gateway is scalable to avoid future problems.
• 
Contract. Beware of a contract! Some companies want you to 
sign a two-year contract, so you would not be able to change 
your gateway during this period. Pay close attention to a contract 
offered by the payment solution that you choose.
• 
Reputation. Don’t forget to first check the reputation of the 
payment gateway providers that you are considering. Try 
researching social networks or forums.
You know how to choose a payment gateway, so you can also check our list of 
the best payment solutions for your website: Best Payment Gateways for Modern 
eCommerce29.
The leading payment gateways are PayPal, Stripe, and Authorize.net. PayPal is the 
most popular and reliable solution. It is widely used among ecommerce merchants in all 
platforms, including Magento. PayPal supports almost all types of payments, as well as 
related operations: web payments, mobile payments, eBay integration, online invoicing, 
and so forth.

Stripe is the most prominent gateway among recent market players. Since Stripe is 
designed for ecommerce websites, online marketplaces, mobile apps, and subscription 
services, it is a perfect solution for multichannel enterprises. This gateway offers all the 
features that you will ever need.
Authorize.net is another giant in the payment gateway market. It is the most powerful 
and well-known payment solution. It offers custom payment forms and extra security.
This section covered market leaders, but you can easily choose another payment 
solution. Otherwise, let’s go the next stage of the chapter, which covers the core topic of 
shipping.
Magento Shipping
Shipping is a constant part of every ecommerce business. In order to make this process 
flawless, you can utilize Magento extensions. Custom Shipping Methods And Rules30 
discusses a set of tools that can help you avoid headaches with delivery, rates, and other 
aspects of custom shipping methods and rules.
Considering the following questions can help you determine the best shipping 
provider for your specific needs.
• 
Where are you shipping to? Does your provider support these 
countries?
• 
What types of products are you shipping? What is the average size 
of your orders?
• 
What is the shipment processing speed offered by your shipping 
provider?
• 
Does it support tracking?
• 
Are there insurance options?
• 
Does it feature live rates integration?
You should understand your shipping options and needs. For instance, multiple 
shipping options let your customers choose a provider from among a list of the providers 
that you work with. There is also free shipping. Customers like this option, so you should 
think about its implementation. Another key option is flat rate shipping. You can offer it 
instead of free shipping by charging a flat rate for deliveries for every package. This option 
can also ranges for various order totals or weights.
Real-time carrier rates are much more complex than other shipping solutions. They 
depend on various factors, such as package weight and shipping location, but at the 
same time charges the exact amount of money that your provider will charge you. The 
customer needs to add a product to his cart to see the most accurate price.

methods-and-rules.html.

I should mention the click-and-collect option. The concept of click-and-collect or 
the instore pickup business model is very simple and at the same time counter-intuitive. 
A customer buys goods on a company’s website and rather than wait for the postman 
several days later, picks up these goods at a local brick-and-mortar store. More about this 
option can be found here: Click & Collect (In-store pickup) Magento extensions31.
Note that all the leading market players, such as UPS, DHL, and FedEx, offer all of 
these options. Moreover, they provide integration with Magento.
With installed extensions, a reliable payment gateway, and convenient shipping 
options, your store is ready for the data import procedure, which is required if you are 
not new to ecommerce and already have an ecommerce website on another platform. To 
get all of your products within the Magento website, read the next part of this chapter.
Data/Product Import
Figure 1-23.  Product import
In this section, I explain one of the most advanced tasks of the Magento store 
management: product import. The following guide includes a description of the CSV file 
structure and all of its columns, as well as detailed information about product attributes 
related to the import procedure.
The Magento import is necessary if you are going to migrate from another 
ecommerce platform. The procedure described next helps transfer products, clients, 
and orders from an existing online store to a new Magento website. Even if you are not 
familiar with ecommerce, the following part of the chapter will be useful to you, since it 
describes core aspects of Magento, but you can easily skip it and return later.

CSV File Structure for the Magento Products Import
For working with CSV (comma-separated values) files, I strongly recommend that you use 
OpenOffice.
Minimum Required Columns for a Simple Product Import
The easiest way to understand what data is required in a CSV file is to export some 
products from your Magento store. If you don’t have any ecommerce stores based on this 
platform, you can always use several products for a test. Fill in all product information, 
add images, and then try to export them. Just go to Magento admin ➤ System ➤ Dataflow 
profiles ➤ Export all products. As a result, you will get a CSV file with dozens of columns. 
Let’s take a closer look at them. Next, I provide a brief description of a CSV file’s parts.
• 
websites. A website entity is associated with a product. In default 
Magento and in most other cases, it is “base.”
• 
store. A store entity is associated with a product. In default 
Magento and other cases, it is “admin.”
■
■Warning!  websites and store can be the reason behind a problem when products are 
not displayed on the front end or the Magento admin panel after your import. So you should 
check if the values used there are correct. If you are not sure what values to use, you can try 
the default ones: base and admin (Magento admin ➤ System ➤ Manage stores). 
• 
type. The types of a product: simple product, grouped product, 
configurable product, virtual product, bundle product, 
downloadable product.
• 
attribute_set. The “default” or another attribute set used for a 
product. See it in Magento Admin ➤ Catalog ➤ Attributes ➤ 
Manage Attributes sets.
• 
tax_class_id. Product tax classes: None, Taxable goods, Shipping. 
You can manage them in Magento Admin ➤ Sales ➤ Tax.
• 
status. The status of a product can be enabled or disabled. If a 
product is disabled, it will not be displayed on the front end.
• 
weight. The weight of a product; just use 1 if you don’t need it.
• 
sku. A unique product identification.
• 
name. The name of a product.
• 
price. The price of a product.

Chapter 1 ■ Setup
41
• 
description. A full description of a product that is displayed on a 
product page.
• 
short_description. A short description is displayed on a product 
page and on other pages, depending on template settings.
• 
visibility. The visibility of a product on the front end: Not Visible 
Individually / Catalog, Search / Catalog / Search.
• 
category_ids. Magento category ids are associated with different 
products. They are created in Magento admin ➤ Catalog ➤ 
Categories. To get a category id, check it in Magento admin.
• 
qty. The available quantity of a product. It is used to control the 
in-stock/out-of-stock status of a product.
• 
is_in_stock. Sets up a default status of a product (boolean value 1 
or 0): in stock (1) or out of stock (0). Out-of-stock products are not 
displayed on the front end and can’t be sold.
• 
image, small_image, thumbnail. First, you have to upload 
images into the media/import folder in your Magento installation 
folder, and then enter an image file name prepended with a slash. 
You can use the same large image for all three types of product 
images; Magento will scale it to other required sizes.
■
■Tip   Images are required for successful product import in Magento, but if you want to 
import products without images you can use a trick with the default Magento product image 
placeholders located at skin/frontend/default/default/images/catalog/product/placeholder. 
You can find three images there: image.jpg, small_image.jpg, and thumbnail.jpg . Copy and 
paste them to the media/import folder and use them for your products. Product images can 
be updated during the next import procedure.
To import multiple product images and galleries, you have to use the Improved 
Import32 extension, since Magento does not provide this feature out of the box (more 
extensions follow).
CSV File sample consists only of the columns described. If you’ve decided to give it 
a try, you need a category with id=3 and placeholder images copied from skin/fron-tend/
default/default/images/catalog/product/placeholder to the media/import folder.

Extended Import with Additional Features
To get the full list of columns, you can just export existing products, as well as imported 
earlier (as in CSV sample). Appropriate export options are situated in Magento admin ➤ 
System ➤ Import/Export ➤ Dataflow ➤ Profiles ➤ Export all products.
Now you can get a complete list of default columns used in Magento product import. 
You can use them for the import procedure which includes column names and example 
data. In most cases, it is not difficult to understand what data can be placed there.

Magento Product Import Tips and Tricks
Product Import Custom Options
Unfortunately, default Magento lacks custom options for product import. But you can 
solve this problem by using the Improved Import33 extension. With the help of this 
module, you can get new options and a new column in a CSV file. This column includes 
the following specific options: name, type, and price.
Product Attributes
Magento doesn’t provide you the ability to import product attributes and values out of the 
box. But you can use this solution: Import Product Attributes into Magento34.

Chapter 1 ■ Setup
43
Products with Multiple Attribute Values
You can import products with multiple attribute values if you have attributes with values 
in the Magento admin and you want to associate them with existing imported products.
Import Multiple Product Images and Images from External URLs
By default, you are not able to import multiple product images and images from external 
URLs, but it’s possible with the Improved Import extension. With this Magento module, 
you can add as many images as you need in an additional CSV column and upload them 
to the media/import folder. The same process is suitable for images from external URLs.
Product Tier Prices Import
You can easily import product tier prices from different customer groups with the 
Improved Import extension.
Product Import Errors and Solutions
The following describes some potential product import errors and their solutions.
Image Does Not Exist
If you’ve got an “Image does not exist” error in any product images required for import, 
you didn’t properly set that image in the CSV image column in your media/import folder. 
To solve this problem, you can use the trick described earlier (import everything without 
images) or use the Improved Import extension to find out which product images are 
missing.
Products Are Not Displayed on the Front End After Import
If products are not displayed in your front end after import, you must check "columns = 
values" in your CSV file. Check the following column descriptions:
• 
websites = base
• 
store = admin
• 
status = Enabled
• 
visibility = Catalog, Search
• 
category_ids = NUMBER (must be valid enabled category id in 
you store)
• 
qty > 1
• 
is_in_stock = 1

Chapter 1 ■ Setup
44
Products Are Not Displayed on the Back End (Magento Admin) 
After Import
Primarily, you have to check "websites = base" and "store = admin" in your CSV file. If 
everything is alright there, you should go to the next step of this guide and perform some 
cleanup in Magento.
Strange Stacks and Other Errors
If nothing else helps, use the Magento cleanup tools. Read this article: http://goo.gl/
izm1Zo. It shows how to clean up Magento after a failed import process. Before using 
this method, make sure that you’ve double-checked your CSV files according to the 
requirements described.
Magmi
Another complex Magento import solution is Magmi, an open source tool with dozens of 
features and settings that makes Magento import flawless. It is extremely powerful, but 
not easy to use. You can download Magmi here: http://goo.gl/aF7nd.
Excel Import to Magento with Cobby
Cobby35 is another useful tool designed with productivity and usability in mind. It 
connects your Magento website with Excel in real time, so you can edit all of your 
attributes and add new products without any headaches. Thus, Cobby is one of the most

You are now familiar with Magento downloading and installation, what to do with a 
server and hosting, which templates and extensions to choose and how to install them, 
and how to import product data into your Magento store. So, it’s time to talk about a key 
topic of this chapter: performance.
Performance
Performance is extremely important for every website—and ecommerce web stores 
are not an exception. Statistics differ from market to market, but the negative impact 
of slow speed is obvious. According to Summit.co.uk, in 2013, slow websites cost UK 
online retailers more than £8 billion. At the same time, there is information about the US 
market’s $3 billion ecommerce sales loss.
Website performance tests by Summit.co.uk showed that over 90% of the 230 leading 
online retailers were failing to meet the industry’s benchmark of a three-second page 
load. Furthermore, it took some about eight seconds to display a page. But how does this 
affect a visitor’s behavior?
Forty-four percent of online customers think that a transaction has failed if the 
checkout is slow. As a result, many of them (33%) abandon their carts to look for 
ecommerce stores with better performance. A transaction with a two-second delay results 
in a high shopping cart abandonment rate, which is more than 80%.
The Metrics
There are new and existing consumers on every ecommerce web store. Thus, we can 
speak about two types of interaction: first view and repeat views. Both have three specific 
metrics: time to first byte, render start, and load time.
With time to first byte, you measure the amount of time required for servers to react 
to a request of a browser to send data. With render start, you measure the amount of time 
necessary for the first page element to be displayed in a browser. Load time means the 
total amount of time required to load all elements of a page.
The metrics should be measured under normal and peak loads conditions. You can 
use Webpagetest.org to do this. A report indicates what is slowing down your ecommerce 
website. The most common reasons are heavy images and interactive page features, site 
build shortcuts, a poor hosting environment, and so forth. These are Amazon’s results for 
the first view:
• 
First byte: 0.285 sec
• 
Render start: 0.944 sec
• 
Load time: 2.071 sec

Chapter 1 ■ Setup
46
These are the results for the second view:
• 
First byte: 0.285 sec
• 
Render start: 0.833 sec
• 
Load time: 1.346 sec
Such results are an example of top-page load speed metrics to some extent. Next, I 
talk about all the solutions designed to optimize Magento ecommerce site performance 
and to achieve the aforementioned results.
This Magento Performance Ultimate Guide36 is written for all versions of Magento 
(including Magento 2). It is suitable for the both Community and Enterprise editions. 
Additionally, it is useful for PHP and MySQL applications.
Magento Server-side Performance
You will find information about Magento server optimization in this section of the 
chapter. I show all the core aspects of this process.
Magento Optimized Hosting Services
You need to choose a hosting service for your Magento store. With a web hosting service, 
you make your ecommerce Magento store accessible via the World Wide Web. Th 
hosting service greatly influences performance. For example, a poor hosting solution can 
noticeably slow down your website. You can check our “Best Magento optimized hosting” 
blog post to find out the best solution for you. I would now like to draw your attention to 
Nexcess and Rackspace.
With Nexcess, you get full hosting options for your Magento website. The basic plan 
is $19.95 per month, but you have to pay annually if you want this exact price. If you 
choose a monthly payment, Nexcess costs $24.95 per month. For both solutions, you get 
one IP, 7.5GB of free space, 16GB RAM, 2x Quad Core E5620, 75GB of data per month, 
9 additional stores, and 30 accounts per server. You can launch a demo for all proposed 
Nexcess plans.
This hosting service is the cheapest and the most stable and reliable among all 
Magento-optimized hosting services. I highly recommend that you try Nexcess SIP 200 as 
the perfect Magento hosting solution for both small and middle-sized Magento stores.
Rackspace is another top-notch hosting provider. The company has been on the 
market since 2008. Today, it includes more than 1,000 Magento clients worldwide. 
The cheapest Rackspace solution costs $499 per month. It best suits stores with 100 
concurrent visitors and 150,000 products. For this money, you will get one quad core 
processor, 1 x 146GB 10K SAS, 4GB of RAM, Cisco ASA 5505 firewall, and 2TB Bandwidth 
every month.

Nginx as a Magento Web Server
Magento Nginx configuration
Official manual on Magento wiki
You can always use LAMP as a simple hosting solution for your Magento store, but 
there are cases when the usage of Apache with mod_php is not the best idea. For instance, 
when your ecommerce Magento store has dynamic content generated by PHP scripts in 
addition to static files. For such situations, Nginx with PHP-FPM can be a better idea.
For simultaneous HTTP/HTTPS connections, Apache uses a large quantity of RAM 
and CPU cycles. The problem is particularly acute for the standard Apache configuration 
and the mod_php prefork. Since each Apache child process generally requires around 
100MB RAM for every request, a dedicated 16GB RAM web server is limited to just 150 
concurrent requests.
One of the major advantages of Nginx is its event-based structure (Apache is process 
based). Thus, Nginx doesn’t require any new process to increase the level of concurrency. 
As a result, the memory footprint of Nginx is very low. In addition, Nginx exploits 
asynchronous and nonblocking I/O.
Nginx is operated by a pre-set number of worker processes, and each of them 
exists in the form of a single isolated process. Due to the event-driven and non-blocking 
architecture, Nginx allows every single worker process to handle requests from multiple 
clients.
You can benefit from Nginx even if you aren’t going to handle thousands of requests 
at the same time. This server solution scales in all directions: from the smallest VPS to 
servers’ clusters.
Nginx handles about 10,000 HTTP/HTTPS requests per second. It uses just 10MB to 
20MB of RAM and averages 10% to 15% of CPU. Notice that in HTTPS, the usage of CPU is 
higher because of decryption/encryption routines.
The biggest drawback of Nginx is the absence of mod_php or its analogs designed for 
the direct execution of PHP apps. Being a static content web server and a reverse HTTP/ 
FastCGI proxy, Nginx can’t run Magento directly. In order to do so, it must utilize other 
means. The most reliable solution of this problem is PHP-FPM established for running 
high-load websites with PHP web apps. PHP-FPM consumes a small amount of resident 
memory and offers some unique features, such as adaptive process spawning, advanced 
logging with a slow log for slowly executing PHP scripts, the ability to start workers 
with different php.ini and "uid/gid/chroot/environment", an emergency restart for an 
accidental opcode cache destruction, real-time data on performance, and server activity.
To use Nginx with your Magento store, you need the front end enhanced with the 
following:
• 
Caching
• 
Reverse FastCGI proxy, which handles all HTTP/HTTP 
connections
• 
All static file delivery
• 
PHP-FPM

Chapter 1 ■ Setup
48
In this case, Nginx performs as a reverse FastCGI proxy for all dynamic content 
requests. All of them are proxied to a back-end PHP-FPM app and delivered back to a 
visitor after a response.
The usage of Nginx as a load balancer (one Nginx front end plus several PHP-FPM 
back ends) leads to a back-end failover and both high scalability and availability for the 
Magento installation. And you eliminate the need to utilize a hardware load balancer or 
any other associated expenses.
Monitoring Tools and Analyzers
A slow page or other negative user experiences could be the reason for leaving a webstore 
long before getting to checkout. Luckily, there are a lot of different monitoring tools and 
analyzers designed to identify a problem in time.
New Relic can be used to mark various operations, such as key transactions, for 
example triggers for custom alerting. Another function of this tool helps observe the 
slowest queries. Thanks to the “app map” feature, New Relic provides a clear view of the 
application dependencies that occur on your Magento ecommerce site. This feature also 
works along with third-party extensions and external services. With the app map feature, 
you can easily find the “weakest link” in your application chain. However, there are two 
other features that should be mentioned: Apdex scoring and alerting. With the aid of 
Apdex scoring, New Relic evaluates how well the Magento app is performing according to 
industry standards. Since the feature is combined with alerting, you will be always notified 
when the performance of your Magento store is challenged, due any variety of reasons.
Debugging Magento Performance with New Relic
Magento New Relic Integration on GitHub
Yireo New Relic Magento Extension
With the AppDynamics platform, you get full visibility of Magento-based PHP app 
performance. The solution provides rapid installation and high scalability. AppDynamics 
automatically discovers the Magento application topology. The tool provides the ability 
to customize a monitoring process by choosing which transactions to include or exclude 
from a real-time view. It also distinguishes web and mobile experiences, and expands 
visibility from the user to a database by correlating the performance of the database to 
originating transaction performance metrics. In addition, you are able to monitor root-
cause errors and exceptions in real time.
Magento MySQL-Optimized Configuration
Proper MySQL configuration is among the most robust enhancements made to ensure 
the supreme performance of a Magento store. It requires an understanding of your 
hardware–primarily the available RAM. Next, I discuss the most reliable solutions 
elaborated to optimize Magento and that enhance a website’s performance with the help 
of proper MySQL configurations.

MariaDB Instead of Default MySQL
MySQL is not a necessity, so you can always move out of it. There are two popular 
alternative solutions: MariaDB and Percona. The first one is a fork of MySQL developed 
by the Magento community. MariaDB was created under GNU GPL. Its goals are as 
follows:
• 
Maintain high MySQL compatibility
• 
Ensure a drop-in replacement capability with a binary 
equivalency
• 
Match with MySQL commands and APIs

Chapter 1 ■ Setup
52
MongoGento by Smile Open Source Solutions
There is also an opportunity to use the NoSQL database instead of MySQL. Therefore, 
all you need is MongoGento by Smile Open Source Solutions. Since this module 
provides your Magento store with the ability to use MongoDB, you will reduce the size 
of your database and the Magento EAV model impact. The second reason of these two 
improvements is heterogeneous catalogues, designed for millions of products. At the 
same time, you retain the flexibility of a document model.
Another strong point of MongoGento is its performance. The combination of SolR, 
MageCache, and MongoDB makes both the front end and the back end extremely fast. I 
need to mention that MongoGento is an open source, scalable, and secure alternative to 
MySQL that has a quick installation.
The only drawback is a conflict among MongoGento and some other modules. 
For example, product catalog rules are not able to handle some attributes if you use 
MongoGento. For more information, go to MongoGento’s GitHub or official web page:
MongoGento on Ecommerce-Performances

MySQL and InnoDB Optimized Configuration
The following are the general options in a MySQL and InnoDB optimized configuration:
• 
max_connections: The maximum number of connections to 
allow. Watch this value: max_used_connections.
• 
thread_cache: Cache to prevent the creation of excessive thread. 
The good value is 50–100. Watch threads_created.
• 
table_cache/table_open_cache: Opens table instances cache. 
Multiple entries for single table are possible. Watch this status 
value: opened_tables and start with 4096.
• 
open_files_limit: Up to two file handlers are required for MyISAM 
tables. Each connection is file handler. It is safe to set to 65535 for 
the most systems.
• 
table_definition_cache: Cache table definitions and use only one 
entry per table. Opened_table_definitions to watch. Set + 10% to 
the number of tables unless there are 50K+ tables.
• 
back_log: Adjustment for many connections/sec is required. The 
reasonable value is 2048.
• 
max_allowed_packet: Sets a limit for the maximum query size 
and internal string variable size. The good value is 16MB.
• 
max_connect_errors: Prevents password brute force attack. Can 
be a cause of a Host Blocked error message. The good value is 
about 1000000.
• 
skip_name_resolve: Helps avoid DNS lookup on connection. 
Don’t use host names for GRANTs.

Chapter 1 ■ Setup
53
• 
old_passwords: This shouldn’t be enabled. It causes the use of 
insecure password hash.
• 
log_bin: Enable this parameter for replication and point in time 
recovery. To avoid default naming, you should set it to mysql-bin.
• 
sync_binlog: Make Binlog durable. Set to 1 for RAID with BBU or 
Flash. It turns slow drives into a performance killer.
• 
expire_log_days: Purges old binary logs after the set number of 
days. A good value is 14. Don’t forget about weekly backups.
• 
tmp_table_size
• 
max_heap_table_size: Typically set to same value. Created_tmp_
disk_tables status variable. BLOB/TEXT fields cause on disk table 
of any size.
• 
query_cache_size: Enable this parameter only if it is tested to 
provide considerable gains. It often causes stalls and contention. 
Remember, you should not set it over 512MB.
• 
sort_buffer_size: Used for sorting in memory buffer. Watch sort_
merge_passes. Set within sessions for large queries. Good value is 
up to 1MB. Larger values hurt small queries performance.
• 
join_buffer_size: Use for better performance of joins with no 
indexes. But it is better to get rid of such joins. The reasonable 
value is 8MB.
• 
default_storage_engine: It uses the InnoDB engine for tables if 
nothing else is specified.
• 
read_rnd_buffer_size: A buffer for reading rows in sorted offer. It 
specifies the maximum value. Use values around 16MB, because 
they often make sense. Do not mix with read_buffer_size.
• 
tmpdir: Specifies location of temporary directory. It is often 
a good choice unless a very large temporary space is needed. 
tmpdir=/dev/shm.
The following are MyISAM options:
• 
key_buffer_size: Caches MyISAM indexes, but doesn’t cache 
data. Requires up to 30% of memory if using MyISAM only.
• 
myisam_recover: Automatically repairs corrupted MyISAM 
tables after crash. The good value is BACKUP,FORCE.
• 
myisam_sort_buffer_size: Buffer used for building MyISAM 
indexes by Sort. Good values are between 8MB and 256MB
• 
low_priority_updates: This parameter allows higher concurrency 
for SELECTs. It may starve update queries.

Chapter 1 ■ Setup
54
• 
bulk_insert_buffer_size: A buffer for bulk inserts optimization. 
Values of 1/4 of key_buffer_size make sense. The value is per 
connection.
The following are the InnoDB memory settings:
• 
innodb_buffer_pool_size: This is the most important setting. 
About 80% of memory is allocated here.
• 
innodb_buffer_pool_instances: Reduces contention. Set it to 4+ 
in MySQL 5.5+.
• 
innodb_log_buffer_size: A buffer for log files. Good values are 
between 4MB and 128MB.
• 
innodb_ibuf_max_size: Controls the size of the insert buffer. 1/2 
of buffer pool by default. Smaller values are good for SSD.
The following are the InnoDB IO options:
• 
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit: Controls durability. Use 1: 
flush and sync; 2: flush; 0: neither.
• 
innodb_flush_method: this parameter controls how InnoDB 
performs IO. O_DIRECT is a good value for most servers.
• 
innodb_auto_lru_dump: Percona Server feature designed for 
quick warm up. The good value is 300 (seconds).
• 
innodb_io_capacity: Controls InnoDB assumption about disk 
performance. Increase it for faster drives,
• 
innodb_read_io_threads:
• 
innodb_write_io_threads: Controls the number of threads by 
doing reads and writes. Since MySQL 5.5 has async IO, very high 
values might not be needed; 4 is a good default value.
• 
innodb_flush_neighbor_pages: Percona Server feature designed 
to control how flushing work. Disable it for SSD by setting to 0.
The following are other InnoDB options:
• 
innodb_log_file_size: sizes of redoes log file. Larger logs provide 
better performance, but with longer recovery.
• 
innodb_log_files_in_group: Leave it at 2.
• 
innodb_file_per_table: Store each InnoDB table in a separate file.
• 
innodb=force: Enable so MySQL is disabled to start if InnoDB 
could not initialize. Otherwise it might start but with the error on 
access to all InnoDB tables.
• 
innodb_lock_wait_timeout: Waiting time for row-level locks 
before bailing out.

Chapter 1 ■ Setup
55
• 
innodb_old_blocks_time: Use to make buffer pool scan resistant. 
Good values are around 1000.
• 
innodb_file_format: Sets the file format that InnoDB will use. 
The default legacy format is Antelope. Barracuda allows you to 
use new features.
• 
innodb_stats_on_metadata: Update statistics on metadata 
access (Information_schema queries). To disable it for more 
workloads, set to 0. InnoDB will refresh stats when the table 
changes significantly.
• 
performance_schema: Enables Performance Schema in MySQL 
5.5+ and watches potential overhead.
• 
log_slow_queries: Enables Slow Query Log.
• 
long_query_time: With this parameter set to 0 periodically, you 
can get sample of the load.
• 
log_slow_verbosity=full: more data about queries in Percona Server.
• 
low_warnings=2: Warnings about disconnects in an error log.
• 
userstat_running=1: Advanced Table and Index usage statistics 
for both Percona Server and MariaDB.
MySQL Settings Optimization with Tuning Primer
The Tuning Primer shell script allows developers to review the MySQL settings of a 
Magento store and make adjustments to them for database stability and performance 
increase. The script analyzes MySQL stats and provides recommendations on tuning a 
MySQL server. The uptime required to correctly work the script is more than 48 hours. 
The Tuning Primer script is developed for all MySQL versions, starting with version 3.23.
Although there are a lot of articles about Magento performance, I advise you to pay 
attention to Magento on Steroids. Its author shares his best practices related to his daily 
work with Magento performance issues; he makes a strong emphasis on Magento server 
optimization.
Zend PHP Accelerator Configurations (Performance 
Improvements with OPcache)
As a code caching module, OPcache can significantly improve PHP performance and 
the performance of an entire store. OPcache uses shared memory to store a precompiled 
script bytecode, eliminating the need to load and parse scripts on every request, which 
is common for PHP. Thus by optimizing OPcache settings, you improve the performance 
of your Magento website. Check the article Enhanced Magento Performance with 
Optimized OPcache Settings to find out more about the optimization of OPcache settings.
Note that there are several other PHP accelerators developed to improve webstore 
performance. You can find the most useful and reliable solutions in our blog post The 
Best PHP Accelerators.

How to Use Redis with Magento
Redis (Remote dictionary server) is an open source, networked, in-memory data 
structure server that stores keys with optional durability. Being one of the most popular 
key-value stores, Redis is suitable for Magento. The ecommerce platform currently 
provides support for various cache back ends with file systems; but most of them cannot 
cope with a growing number of requests, thus they provide terrible scaling.
Moreover, some of them suffer from other limitations. A good example of such 
restrictions is the lack of support to group cache entries. To solve this problem, you can 
tune your Magento to a Redis store.
The current Memcached has no significant advantages over Redis. Both solutions are 
extremely fast, and all major features of Memcached are now offered by Redis. However, 
Redis surpasses Memcached. The latest version of Redis offers out-of-the-box clustering. 
The other useful tools are replication and Sentinel. With this combination, Redis offers a 
bunch of advantages over Memcached. The following features turn Redis into a real data 
store (Memcached is just a cache):
• 
Data types with powerful commands: sorted sets, hashes, lists, 
and so forth
• 
Default persistence to disk
• 
Optimistic locking transactions (WATCH/MULTI/EXEC)
• 
Extremely fast pub/sub
• 
Values are limited to 512MB (1MB per key in Memcached)
• 
Built-in clustering (as of 3.0)
• 
Lua scripting (as of 2.6)
Furthermore, Redis is more flexible than Memcached. It provides higher scalability, 
availability, and administration. Redis is not only a better solution for use cases 
associated with Memcached, but it is also suitable for new occasions.
The process of the Redis implementation as a cache and session back end is fully 
described on Inchoo: Redis cache backend and session storage in Magento.
There is another useful article related to this topic: How to Use Redis with Magento.
Don’t miss this PDF tutorial: Redis as a Cache Backend in Magento.
There are two useful projects on GitHub as well. The first one is Cm_RedisSession. 
It is a Redis-based session handler designed for Magento. Cm_RedisSession has a lot of 
useful features.
Go to Cm_RedisSession for a detailed description of this tool. There, you will also 
find an installation tutorial and an example of configurations.
With Cm_Cache_Backend_Redis, you get a Zend_Cache back end with Redis and 
tags support. The back end makes it possible to turn every Redis server into a central 
cache storage. Keep in mind that with Cm_Cache_Backend_Redis, full tags support 
doesn’t require the use of TwoLevels cache. Thus, this back end is best suited for use 
in a cluster or on a single machine. Cm_Cache_Backend_Redis works with any Zend 
Framework project, all versions of Magento are supported as well.

How to Use CDN with Magento
A content delivery network (CDN) is a complex of servers with multiple data centers 
around the world and across the Internet. The main goal of every content delivery 
network is to provide content to end users with the highest possible performance and 
availability. CDNs work with different web objects and store downloadable content. They 
also provide faster access to apps, streaming media, and social networks. Thus, CDNs 
play an important role in modern online content delivery. There are dozens of possible 
solutions, but I would like to draw your attention to CloudFlare.
CloudFlare relies on recent hardware innovations, advanced network routing, and 
modern web server technology improvements. As a next-gen CDN, CloudFlare works 
better than its competitors. It is also more affordable and easier to set up. This CDN 
solution provides your website with a load speed that is twice as fast (regardless of the 
location of your visitors). I should also mention that CloudFlare works well with both 
static and dynamic content. Furthermore, the company guarantees that your Magento 
store will always be online. Last but not least, there is support for IPv6 networks and other 
CDNs. To set up your web store to use this CDN, you can utilize our CloudFlare control 
extension.

business. Since speed is taken into account by every search engine, it influences rankings. 
Thus, sites with better performance have advantages over the slower ones. That’s why 
Magento’s application-side performance also plays a crucial role.
Full Page Cache Magento Extensions
There are a lot of full page cache Magento extensions designed to improve website speed 
and reduce page load time. All modules from this group are based on the same principle 
explained next. Magento automatically generates and delivers pages to first-time 
visitors. These pages are copied and saved to cache. At some point, all the pages of your 
Magento store get cached copies, and the necessity to generate new pages from scratch is 
eliminated. Therefore, the full page cache extension reduces the load from the database 
and the server, and decreases page load time.

You can find a complete list of the Full Page Cache extensions here: The Best 
Magento Full Page Cache Extensions40.
The best free solutions among these is Lesti; whereas the most robust paid FPC 
Magento module is Extendware.
The Lesti::Fpc Magento extension (https://goo.gl/NHxxDs) doesn’t require varnish 
or any other external tools and solutions. It works with events, replaces dynamic blocks 
before sending a response to the visitor, and caches cms_page_index, cms_index_index, 
catalog_product_view, and catalog_category_view pages by default. The module supports 
multiple stores and currencies. Additionally, Lesti::Fpc provides mobile themes and 
custom price groups. Hit this link for further information. Please note that the extension 
is good for small projects, but if you have a growing store, I definitely recommend that you 
use Extendware Full Page Cache.

This solution possesses a positive reputation and tons of reviews from professionals. 
It features several add-ons that make it even faster, offers support for Redis, and provides 
reliable customer service. By using this full page cache, you will be able to receive help 
from Extendware specialists. Here are the core features of the module:
• 
Extendware Full Page Cache does not use the database, handling 
90% of all requests. Thus, you can see the same speed as in 
Varnish, but with a better cache hit rate and easier configurations.
• 
The module enables entire page cache, groups of pages, or just 
specific pages related to an affected product. Thus, you don’t 
flush what you don’t really need to.
• 
Moreover, Extendware Full Page Cache fully supports catalog 
sorting. Please note that other similar extensions do not support 
the default Magento sort order changing in the catalog, which is 
the reason for incorrect caching in the default category sort order.
• 
There is multi-level cache support. The Full Page Cache extension 
offers three cache systems combined in one. Primary Page Cache 
increases server throughput by more than 100+ times. Secondary 
Page Cache offers hole punch support for logged users or visitors 
with products in a cart. Lightening Page Cache is 2–200 times 
faster than the primary cache level.
Don’t forget to check other features in our Extendware Full Page Cache review:

extension there.
Magento Cache Crawler/Warmer Extensions
It’s extremely necessary to enhance your Full Page Cache Extension with a warmer/
crawler module. This module crawls your ecommerce store to ensure that all pages load 
as fast as possible. In addition, a warmer/crawler extension refreshes old cached pages. 
Thus, all of your customers get the newest content at the fastest speed.
Moreover, cache warmer/crawler extensions help improve a website’s cache hit rate 
by pre-caching uncached pages. As a result, you get more cached and less uncached 
requests. A list of warmers is here: The Best Full Page Cache Warmers/Crawlers For 
Magento42. I recommend that you use a solution offered by maverick193. You can get it for 
free. The best paid module is Extendware, which provides more robust features.

CSS and JS Minification
Another method of the Magento speed optimization concerns JavaScript and CSS files. It 
is possible to combine, compress, and cache them to enhance Magento’s performance. 
I recommend that you use the Fooman Speedster Advanced Magento extension for 
the aforementioned operations. The module combines multiple JavaScript files or CSS 
files into a single file. It reduces the total size of loadable files and the number of HTTP 
requests, so you get a shorter page load time. You can download the Speedster Magento 
extension for free.

Magento Cleaning
Due to an excellent logging system, the details of every request in Magento are logged. 
This leads to an oversized database, however, which slows down the website. Fortunately, 
there are many Magento cleaning solutions. Maintaining a database through log cleaning 
leads to a dramatic improvement in latency and performance. Nexcess explains how to 
optimize a large Magento database and increase the performance of an ecommerce store. 
You can take a look at a useful guide on Magikcommerce and these tips from different 
specialists. And don’t forget to protect yourself from future headaches with the Yireo_
DisableLog Magento module. Since this tool stops Magento from logging things, you get a 
neater database that will never decrease the performance of your website.

Faster Re-index
Fast re-indexing is another aspect of the Magento server optimization. It reduces 
server loads by speeding up saving products in a catalog. As a result, you increase the 
performance of your online store.
By installing the Improved Indexing Magento module, you will significantly improve 
the speed of the back end. Thus, saving products and categories will be much faster with 
this extension, and your administrators will be able to perform more tasks in a minimal 
amount of time.
Figure 1-26.  Improved Indexing
With the Fast Asynchronous Re-indexing extension, you will also boost the 
performance of your Magento website. This module reduces peak loads on a server by 
speeding up admin-related processes. When someone adds a new product or changes an 
existing one, a query to re-index goods occurs. With the Fast Asynchronous Re-indexing 
extension, a cron process performs data re-indexing in the background. Thus, admins can 
work continuously without any need to wait until re-indexing is finished.

Chapter 1 ■ Setup
62
Varnish Cache
Varnish is designed to minimize a number of contentions between threads. It stores 
data in virtual memory. The selection of what data goes to disk and what is stored in the 
OS cache occurs. As a result, you can avoid a situation where the data is cached by the 
operating system and at the same time moved to a disk.
The Turpentine Magento Extension is developed to improve Magento’s compatibility 
with Varnish. With the aid of Turpentine, you can improve your website’s performance 
by adding a fast-caching reverse proxy to its system. Unfortunately, the default solution 
doesn’t cache requests with cookies, so Magento’s front-end cookies cause a near zero 
hit-rate with Varnish. By installing the Turpentine Magento extension, you provide the 
system with Varnish configuration files (VCLs) and improve Magento’s behavior. Thus, 
Varnish works with Magento.
Turpentine on GitHub
You can use the official manual to learn how to use Magento + Varnish Cache. And 
don’t forget to check a comparison of Full Page Cache vs. Varnish Cache on Amasty.

Improved Magento Catalog Search
A reliable searching tool is useful for every ecommerce store. Luckily, there are a lot of 
extensions designed for providing visitors with the ability to find the desired content. 
I recommend that you pay attention to the Sphinx Search Ultimate and Managed 
Elasticsearch Magento extensions.
The Sphinx Search Ultimate extension helps you improve the quality of a search. 
The module supports more than 660 stop words and understands more than 60,000 
synonyms. It provides your customers with the ability to perform a searching query by 
category names, tags, and product SKUs. The extension costs $149.
Mirasvit Sphinx Search Ultimate Review44
The Managed Elasticsearch Magento extension provides one of the most powerful 
full-text search options available as an open source product. With this Magento module, 
you provide your customers with precise and reliable search results. Additionally, there 
is the opportunity to configure attribute names, descriptions, and SKUs as searchable 
attributes with this extension.

How to Improve Checkout and Add to Cart Speed in Magento
Although you can cache static CMS pages, like products and categories, with Full Page 
Cache, along with a fast back-end cache storage, such as Redis or Memcached, you will 
still have slow dynamic pages. Thus, it is vital to increase checkout and add-to-cart speed 
in your Magento setup. There are also problems related to PHP/web server, which slow 
down your store. Next, I’ll teach you how to improve default performance, making your 
customers loyal to your brand.
One Step Checkout
First, I’d like to draw your attention to One Step Checkout extensions, since they are more 
user-friendly than a default solution. There is an appropriate list of such modules on the 
Firebear blog (The Best One Step / Page Checkout Extensions For Magento45). The best 
free tool is One Step/Page Checkout by IWD (https://goo.gl/72qrA8). The most reliable 
paid solution is One Step Checkout (http://goo.gl/2MjSf). By installing one of these 
extensions, you significantly improve the time required for checkout.

PHP Accelerators
Another crucial aspect that helps to increase site speed is the usage of PHP accelerators 
designed to improve the performance of PHP apps. Most of them cache compiled 
opcode/bytecode to avoid overhead caused by compiling source code during each 
request. The cached code is stored in a shared memory and executed from there. As a 
result, PHP accelerators minimize the amount of slow disk reads and decrease memory 
copying at a runtime. The best PHP accelerators are described here: The Best PHP 
Accelerators46.
Cache Back End
You can easily improve your cache back end with the help of the Performance Cache 
Backends extension by Extendware. The module provides improved file-based and Redis-
based caches optimized for tag flushing. As a result, you get a faster add-to-cart process, 
checkout, and product savings. The extension costs $149 and you can check its review 
here: Extendware Cache Backends / Faster Checkout Magento Extension47.
Indexing
Improved Indexing is another extension by Extendware aimed at improving 
the performance of your Magento store. The module increases the speed of the 
administrative back end. It reduces all slowdowns that occur when saving products or 
categories. As a result, you can perform the same amount of work faster. The price of 
Improved Indexing is $139. You can check the extension here: Extendware Improved 
Indexing Magento Extension Review48.
The Most Reliable Community Advice
By monitoring different forums, I’ve highlighted the following important steps:
	
1.	
To increase the speed of Magento checkout, disable the  
Mage_Rss module, since it forces a “cache clean” four times 
during a checkout process slowing down your website.
	
2.	
If you aren’t using downloadable products, turn off Mage_
Downloadable. This will help to increase the checkout speed, 
as well as reduce the time necessary for cart actions when 
there are multiple items in a cart.

3.	
Set your indexes to manual and disable cache tag storage. 
Both changes provide a huge impact on performance as they 
prevent Magento from flushing out caches and re-indexing 
for each order. Unfortunately, these actions can make your 
content stale.
	
4.	
Perform some profiling and wire up xhprof/xhgui.
Disable Some Core Extensions
The following are some of the core extensions that need to be disabled.
• 
Mage_Adminnotification
• 
Mage_Authorizenet
• 
Mage_Bundle (if it is not used on your website)
• 
Mage_Downloadable
• 
Mage_GiftMessage
• 
Phoenix_Moneybookers
• 
Mage_Paygate (along with disabled Mage_Paypal, Mage_
PaypalUk, and Mage_Authorizenet)
•

• 
Mage_Rss
• 
Mage_Sendfriend
• 
Mage_Tag (if it is not used on your website)
• 
Mage_Weee (along with disabled Mage_XmlConnect)
You can turn off more core extensions, depending on your project, but these are the 
ones that should be disabled most often. Just make sure that you don’t break the stability 
of your Magento.
Always clean the cache and do full end-to-end store testing after disabling to make 
sure that everything works well and there are no errors.

Security Guide
Thousands of Magento websites were infected with the Guruincsite malware, so it is 
extremely important to find out if your store is infected and to prevent it from the virus. 
For further information, check this article: Guruincsite Magento Disaster49.

our Magento security patches50 post.
Eighty percent of Magento shops worldwide are still vulnerable. Check the following 
infographic by Byte for further information. Alternatively, you can read the entire article 
related to the problem (the infographic is the illustration of the article). It describes the 
reason why people do not patch their Magento websites, so it might change your opinion 
about the security problems. 80% of Magento shops worldwide still vulnerable51.
Fortunately, you can easily scan your Magento shop for known security 
vulnerabilities on MageReport52.
Although Magento is the safest ecommerce platform, there are still additional 
security tricks that make it even safer. Thousands of Magento websites have been hacked 
during the past few years. Luckily, there are several useful methods developed to fix 
all the major problems. Next, the most important security tips and reliable security 
extensions are described. You can also check this guide: Magento Security Ultimate 
Guide53.
Name and Password
You should make all of your Magento passwords unique and strong. The same goes for 
your admin name. This simple step can help you improve the security of your website. 
Just create a password that is longer than eight characters and to some extent, you will 
prevent your store from being hacked. Note that passwords should combine numbers, 
letters, and special characters. Indeed, do not use weak usernames such as “admin” or 
“administrator”. If you are using an insecure name and password, you can always change 
them in System ➤ My Account.
Custom Path for Admin Panel
A default path to an admin panel has the following construction: http://storename.com/
admin. Everyone knows it—consequently, it is among Magento security vulnerabilities. 
By changing it to more complex path—for example, http://storename.com/superadmin, 
you push the security of your ecommerce website to a new level. This small step is the 
best defense against broken authentication and session management attacks.
You can always change the Magento admin path in the app/etc/local.xml file. Find 
the line which contains <![CDATA[admin]]> and create a new string instead of admin, for 
instance, superadmin. The new code should look as follows: <![CDATA[superadmin]]>.

Two-Factor Authentication
Another reliable security technique is two-factor authentication. It adds an additional 
security layer to an existing one. The system requires two separate authentications to 
provide users with access. Thus, your Magento website becomes two times more secure. 
You can provide your admins with the two-factor authentication solution using one of 
these Magento modules: Xtento Two-Factor Authentication54 or Extendware Two-Factor 
Authentication55. More Admin Login Security Tools56.
Encrypted (HTTPS/SSL) Connection
Another essential security improvement is the usage of the HTTPS/SSL–secure URLs. By 
being HTTPS/SSL–encrypted, your ecommerce website is PCI-compliant as well. This 
means that you will get a secure data transfer between your site and server. Otherwise, there 
is a risk that data (database information and login details) will be intercepted by hackers.
To enable the HTTPS/SSL secure URLs, you should go to System ➤ Configuration 
➤ General ➤ Web. Then, it is necessary to change “http” to “https” in the base URL, and 
enable the “Use secure URLs for both Frontend and Admin” feature.
File Upload with Secure FTP
In addition to HTTPS/SSL–secure URLs, you can also take care of the FTP connection 
with your server. Use SFTP because it provides an additional encryption of user 
credentials. This protocol uses a private key file for authentication. Make sure that file 
permissions are not set to 777; otherwise, anyone will be able to rewrite them.
Pre-Defined IP Addresses for Administrators
Magento provides the opportunity to set predefined IP addresses for accessing the admin 
panel, which is a robust security enhancement. You just have to create a list of IPs. This 
way, users with other addresses won’t be able to access the admin panel of your website.
To implement this security feature, find your .htaccess file and enter the following code:
1   AuthName "Protected Area"
2   AuthType Basic
3   <Limit GET POST>
4   order deny,allow
5   deny from all
6   allow from 172.161.132.13
7   allow from 153.119
8   </Limit>

extension-review.html.
56https://firebearstudio.com/blog/admin-login-security-extensions-for-magento.html

Chapter 1 ■ Setup
70
Hence, you implement the user permission to access your admin panel with the 
172.161.132.13 IP address, and for everyone whose IP address starts with 153.119. This 
technique supports an unlimited number of IP addresses.
Then, you should go to the Magento root directory and create a new folder called 
admin. Copy the index.php file of your Magento and paste it there. Now, you have to 
change relative paths to the config.php and Mage.php files. Change the following lines:
1   $compilerConfig = '../includes/config.php';
2   $mageFilename = '../app/Mage.php';
You should only add '../'.
Now go to the. htaccess file and enter the following lines:
1   Redirect permanent /index.php/{admin_path} /admin/index.php/{admin_path}
2   Redirect 301 /index.php/{admin_path} /admin/index.php/{admin_path}
Therefore, you will direct users coming to our admin to a new directory.  
{admin_path} indicates the new admin path that was manually changed.
This security step works only with static IP addresses. If your ISP assigns dynamic IP 
addresses, you shouldn’t implement this technique.
Malicious PHP Functions
There are malicious PHP functions that should be disabled. You can use more secure 
alternatives instead. To disable these functions, find your php.ini file, open it, and add the 
following code:
1   disable_functions = "apache_child_terminate, apache_setenv,  
define_syslog_variables, escap\
2   eshellarg, escapeshellcmd, eval, exec, fp, fput, ftp_connect, ftp_exec, 
ftp_get, ftp_login\
3   , ftp_nb_fput, ftp_put, ftp_raw, ftp_rawlist, highlight_file, ini_alter, 
ini_get_all, ini_\
4   restore, inject_code, mysql_pconnect, openlog, passthru, php_uname, 
phpAds_remoteInfo, php\

7   ose, proc_get_status, proc_nice, proc_open, proc_terminate, shell_exec, 
syslog, system, xm\
8   lrpc_entity_decode"
Take into account that you can disable other functions in your php.ini file, as well as 
omit important functions from the code.

Directory Listing
Directory listing is among common server loopholes. It provides everyone with the ability 
to see the directory structure and location of all of its files by simply entering a website’s 
URL. Therefore, you should disable directory indexing by adding the following code in 
your .htaccess file:
1   Options -Indexes
MySQL Injections
Since every Magento website has many form fields for user data input, hackers can easily 
steal this data by injecting MySQL statements. To protect your store from such a threat, 
you should use web firewalls (several apps are described next).
To solve this problem, update your Magento to the latest version because it always 
provides a lot of improvements, bug fixes, new features, and security enhancements. At 
the same time, there is the possibility of new, undiscovered problems related to the latest 
update.
• 
Create backups of your Magento store regularly. This helps you 
decrease every hack damage level and you will be able to restore 
your Magento website faster.
• 
Fix all email loopholes. Keep in mind that your email should not 
be widely known. It should be protected by a unique and secure 
password as well.
• 
Check the security of your Magento website regularly. This will 
help you find all issues at early stages.
• 
Always update your antivirus software. Older versions are not 
able to protect your store from the latest threats.
• 
Find out where your browser comes from. The browser stores 
a lot of necessary information about your Magento website. Try 
not to save passwords in it because any access to your computer 
allows hackers to easily get your credentials.
• 
Hide the local.xml file from public access. It contains sensitive 
data, such as database information and the encryption key. Hide 
it. You can do it by changing file permissions for local.xml to 600(-
rw) or blocking a web access to the entire app directory.
• 
Upgrade your OS to the most recent version. It should provide 
new security improvements.
• 
Install Magento security patches. They are developed to fix all 
current security problems on your store. When writing this guide, 
SUPEE-6285 was the latest.

downloadable documents, set only read permissions, so that no 
program will be able to modify them.
• 
Disable Magento Connect Manager after installing extensions. 
This prevents any random changes.
• 
Use only trusted Magento extensions from reliable sources, such 
as Magento Connect.
• 
Change passwords for outside developers. You can reset your 
original passwords after work is done.
• 
Check web server logs for errors or suspicious activities. This 
way, you will be able to detect threats at early stages.

SEO
Search engines provide your potential customers with a list of search results, where your 
ecommerce website is shown. This list often consists of hundreds of pages. You want to 
see your Magento store at the top; otherwise, it will be lost among the others, and your 
potential customers will never visit it. The only helpful solution to this problem is search 
engine optimization. I have gathered everything that you need to know about this process.
You can start your search engine optimization with the Magento extensions 
described earlier. You can also find the best solutions in this post: Best Magento SEO 
Extensions58. Additionally, you can check Magento Connect for more modules—just hit 
this link. If you need a single reliable solution, pay attention to the Creare SEO Magento 
extension. The module is free, but at the same time it is one of the most robust SEO 
solutions. It enhances your store with several new features, such as an HTML sitemap; 
unique category headings; Noindex on category filters; config editable .htaccess and 
robots.txt files; default page titles and metadescriptions for categories and products; 
discontinued products and 301 redirects; the ability to disable keywords and meta 
description tags; Twitter cards for product pages; a script for performance cleanup; the 
Breadcrumbs schema; a SEO checking page in admin; an XML sitemap fix; a product 
attribute validator; the canonical product redirect, and so forth. You can download Creare 
SEO from Magento Connect here. Hit this link for additional information about the 
extension.
Take into consideration that search engines love fast websites, and ecommerce stores 
are not an exception. So you can improve your rankings by making your store faster.
Just enhance the performance of your Magento website and you will get better SEO 
results. Moreover, you will make your customers more loyal, because they, as well as 
search engines, have a better opinion of faster websites.
In addition to extensions and performance, there are plenty of tips and tricks for 
guaranteed search engine optimization on every website. Next, you will find the most 
popular SEO solutions taken from this post: Ultimate Guide to Magento SEO59. Also check 
our DIY SEO articles60.
Stay Away from Manufacturer’s Descriptions
Many ecommerce merchants use manufacturer’s descriptions in their initial state. As a 
result, hundreds of web stores post the same content. Of course, this provides a negative 
impact on SEO, since search engines want to index only unique content. Add something 
new to the description of your goods, and you will get better rankings. I strongly 
recommend that you avoid copying content from other websites. Spend additional time 
(or money) on rewriting product descriptions.

Extract Benefits from Your Image Alt Tags
There is an “alt” property in the image HTML tag that was originally designed for slow 
Internet connections. But now it has a new purpose. The image alt tag can be used for 
the search engine optimization of your Magento store. Google relies on the content of alt 
tags to define what is on the page (mostly images). That’s why you should create small 
descriptions in the alt property in order to improve SEO.
Tool up with Link Building
A proper link-building strategy will significantly improve the SEO optimization of your 
Magento store. Also don’t forget about cross linking within your website. Check our blog 
post on Link Building Strategies to find out the core SEO improvements that you can 
perform with the help of this set of tactics.
Get More Profit from Similar Products
Let’s imagine that a visitor has landed on the web page of a product that he doesn’t want. 
You can still save the day by proposing similar products on the same page. Thus, the 
customer does not leave your site immediately and won’t provide a negative impact on 
your rankings. Moreover, you will be able to upsell by offering similar goods. Check this 
list of the Best Related Products Magento Extensions for additional information.
Utilize Popular Products Properly
Use your homepage to display products that are popular on the market or within your 
store. This will help engage your returning visitors immediately.
Make Discontinued Products Work for You
Some products from your ecommerce store probably no longer exist. But don’t be in 
haste deleting their pages. Instead, redirect your visitors from old pages to new ones by 
using the server 301 redirect code. You will preserve all of your page rankings this way, so 
don’t make obvious mistakes by deleting useful content.
What Should I Do with the 302 Redirects
Whereas the 301 redirect is a real SEO savior, the 302 redirect is a harmful one because it 
doesn’t pass any link juice to a new page (301 does). Thus, you lose traffic and rankings if 
you use the 302 redirect. However, it’s good to apply it with compare links, wish list links, 
geolocations, and currency switch links. Visit this page to find out more about the 302 
redirect.

Chapter 1 ■ Setup
79
Create a Perfect 404 Page
Deleted page links stay in search engines for a certain amount of time. When a customer 
clicks such a link, the 404 error page is displayed. I recommend that you customize your 
404 page to help visitors find the products that they are looking for. That’s why a custom 
404 page can save you from losing traffic.
Better SEO Results with Good Navigation
When a random user visits your Magento store from a search engine page, but leaves it to 
perform another query, he provides a negative impact on your rankings. The core reason 
for such behavior is navigation. Provide your visitors with a proper user experience and 
you will prevent your Magento SEO from this negative impact. Therefore, make it easy for 
users to find the desired products within your store.
Clean up Your URLs from Store Codes
With default configurations, Magento adds store codes to URLs. These unique identifiers 
are good for locating products within your database, but they are inappropriate in URLs. 
Disable store codes by setting “Add Store Codes to URLs” to No. Go to the Configuration 
menu, select Web, and then Search Engine Optimization. You will see an appropriate 
option there.
Optimize your Magento Store Wisely with Google Analytics
With Google Analytics, you can get all the information that is essential for SEO 
optimization. Luckily, there is an opportunity to connect this service to your ecommerce 
store without any headaches, since Magento supports GA integration. Be wise and get 
more from available resources.
Turn Your Visitors into Buyers with the Aid of the Right 
Keywords
Keywords influence the effectiveness of optimization. Some keywords are more for 
“buying” than others. Pay attention to this nuance, and you will be able to gain more from 
your Magento website.
Unleash the Power of Blogging
By adding a blog to your digital store, you are able to improve its SEO. Post unique and 
relevant content, communicate with your visitors, provide them with useful information, 
and you will engage more customers.

Chapter 1 ■ Setup
80
Get More from Rich Snippets
Due to rich snippets, you can integrate different HTML5 components into your products, 
improving their SEO. For example, ratings and reviews integrated into products appear 
in search engine results and provide you with competitive advantages over other 
ecommerce websites (if they are a five-star ratings).
Enhance SEO with the Help of Security
Use SSL certificates to provide both customers and search engines with a sense of 
security. You will learn how to use SSL later in this chapter.
Never Forget About Your Robots.txt File
It is extremely important to make a custom robots.txt file. All ecommerce stores are 
different, so a generic robots.txt file is unacceptable. I strongly recommend that you 
consider applying the Google Webmaster Tool before using it on a web store.
Stay Mobile-Friendly
If you have an audience of mobile users, then you should provide them with a mobile-
friendly version of your Magento store. According to Google’s policy, websites with a 
responsive design (or with a mobile version) get better rankings in a mobile search. Check 
our posts about Mobilegeddon and Responsive Design for a better understanding of the 
problem.
Be the King of Social Media
Utilize the power of social networks. You will not only improve your SEO, but you will get 
many more new buyers. Pay attention to the fact that Facebook and Twitter can become 
the driving forces of your sales. You just have to use them properly.
That’s all in regards to small SEO tips. More robust optimization is waiting for you next!
More Complex Search Engine Optimizations
If the preceding information is not enough for your ecommerce store, and you plan to 
implement more robust changes to improve SEO, then this section of the chapter is for you.
1. Start with the Basics
1.1. General Configurations
Magento is not only one of the safest ecommerce platforms, but it is one of the most  
SEO-friendly solutions and you can always make it even more SEO optimized.

Chapter 1 ■ Setup
81
I recommend that you update your store to the latest version of the platform and 
enable Server URL rewrites. Just go to System, open Configuration, click the Web options, 
and make an improvement in the Search Engines Optimization section. On the same 
screen, set Add Store Code to URLs (under URL Options) to No.
You can choose between a www and a non-www version of your website URL. But 
which version is more SEO-friendly?
There is no definite answer to this question, so you should decide which one is  
better for you. I only recommend that you create a 301 redirect if you change this setting. 
Use .htaccess with mod_rewrite, because it prevents Magento from adding SID queries  
to URLs.
1.2. Header
“Magento Commerce” is the default title of your Magento store. To improve your SEO, you 
should change this. You can do it in Configuration ➤ Design ➤ HTML Head. Change the 
default title to a new one that describes your store.
You can also add a store name to all of your website’s page titles in the Title Suffix 
field. Keep Prefix, Default Description, and Default Keywords fields empty.
There are production and non-production environments on your Magento store. 
Both have default robots. For non-production applications, you should set NOINDEX, 
NOFOLLOW; for all others, set INDEX, FOLLOW.
Don’t forget about canonical URLs. You can set them using one of these modules.
1.3. CMS Pages
To get better rankings, you can optimize your Magento store’s CMS pages. When they 
are filled with decent content, take both a page title and a SEF URL identifier, go to the 
Metadata tab, and create descriptions for the CMS pages that you are going to work with.
Keep the Keywords field empty. Please note that you should create descriptions 
with your customers in mind, because the descriptions are displayed on search results 
pages. Use only informative descriptions that you’ve written. Avoid using autogenerated 
descriptions.
1.4. Category
To prevent duplicate content issues associated with categories, you should disable the 
“Use categories path for product URLs” option. Go to System, open Configuration, find 
the Catalog options, and click Search Engine Optimization. Set the parameter to No.
To set category information, go to Catalog ➤ Manage Categories and Descriptions 
in Meta Description fields and create a short description. At the same time, use keyword-
rich URLs in URL Key field. Keep the Page Title empty.

Chapter 1 ■ Setup
82
1.5. Product Pages
The optimization of product pages is almost the same as with categories. Keep in mind 
that Meta Title overwrites the title of a page.
Additional search engine optimization includes work with images. You should use 
the alt tag to make your Magento website more SEO-friendly.
2. Make the Most out of the Magento Template
2.1. Headings
Let’s start with the logo. In a default template, it is the <h1> tag, which should be used 
on the front page only! For other pages, use the <h3> tag or lower. Keep in mind that it is 
extremely important to use an <h1> tag for the title of content.
Don’t use headers in side columns and make all text relevant to your shop. Replace 
all <h4> tags for keywordless titles in <div> with <strong> tags.
Use an <h3> tag for product names and <h1> for a category name on category pages. 
In every product page, put the name of a product in an <h1> tag.
2.2 Clean up Code
Optimize your template file by moving JavaScript and CSS to external files. Keep your 
templates clean to get better SEO.
2.3. Speed up Your Store
If you don’t want to deal with a complicated tutorial, you can implement the following 
Magento SEO tips:
	
1.	
Enable caching features in System ➤ Cache Management.
	
2.	
Optimize host and server configurations.
Also, decrease the number of external files! This will help you improve Magento 
performance. You can even merge several external files into one.
3. The Curse of Duplicate Content
Your Magento store has a lot of duplicate content. Due to layered navigation and sorting 
options, every product can be available on up to four pages. You should get rid of copied 
content; search engines must spider it without indexing.

Chapter 1 ■ Setup
83
3.1. Noindex
Install this extension61 (or you can use an alternative solution) for the implementation of 
Noindex.
Go to Settings to check if the indexing of all non-content pages is prevented.
Set all options to Yes. Now, search engines can follow all the links from a set of pages 
but don’t show them while indexing.
3.2 Nofollow
Now it’s time to optimize your non-content pages (it can be painful). To prevent a 
negative impact from login and checkout pages, wish lists, RSS feeds, layered navigation, 
and other similar pages, go to your template files and manually add Nofollow to the 
appropriate links.
3.3 XML Sitemap
Use XML sitemap to provide search engines with information about your content. 
Furthermore, your store will be indexed faster. Go to Catalog ➤ Google Sitemap ➤ Add 
Sitemap to create a sitemap manually. Don’t forget to create a new XML sitemap every 
time you change your inventory.
4. Dealing with Layered Navigation
Layered navigation is one of the biggest optimization nightmares because it is the core 
reason for duplicate content. Therefore, I’ve decided to make a separate section related to 
this problem.
4.1. Canonical Tag
A canonical tag is the number-one remedy for layered navigation. It shows the URLs that 
are available for indexing purposes, so search engines index only appropriate content 
from your website. It is also necessary to mention the simplicity of the canonical tag 
implementation, so don’t be afraid to utilize this technique.
4.2. Parameter Handling
There is a Parameter Handling resource in the Google Webmaster Tool. You can utilize 
it to make your store even more SEO-friendly. The Parameter Handling resource tells 
Google how to interact with your Magento website pages. It’s a very powerful tool and you 
should combine it with the following technique.
61https://www.creare.co.uk/blog/news/creare-seo-magento-extension.

Chapter 1 ■ Setup
84
4.3. Meta Rules
Use Meta Rules to curb layered navigation. They were partly described along with 
Noindex and Nofollow.
4.4. Ajax Navigation
Ajax navigation is the most complex and effective solution. It relies on filters to avoid the 
duplicate content issue. Thus, you don’t have to optimize Ajax navigation for better SEO 
results.
Integration with Google Services
Magento Integration with Google Services is another key part of search engine 
optimization. Next, I explain how to connect your store with Analytics, WebMaster, and 
AdWords.
Google Analytics Magento Integration
Google Analytics is one of your major analytics tools. This freemium service provides 
the ability to track big data related to the traffic of your ecommerce website. You can 
easily review online campaigns and see what happens on your online store in real time. 
With the help of the following Magento extensions, you will be able to integrate Google 
Analytics with your ecommerce website and enhance default abilities of the platform. See 
our blog post Magento Integration with Google Analytics and other Services62.
Google Analytics+ adds new features and advanced capabilities to the default 
module. The extension supports Universal Analytics and dynamic remarketing tags; helps 
improve conversions; tracks checkout process and AdWords conversions; and filters 
reports by different customers. Furthermore, you will be able to track data in a secondary 
profile and combine several sites in one account with this extension. The module is free.
Download the Google Analytics+ Magento Extension.
With the Google Universal Analytics by Aromicon module, you can also enhance 
your ecommerce store with Google Universal Analytics. The extension offers ecommerce 
tracking as well, so you don’t have to spend time on its manual implementation. In 
addition, you will get funnel tracking for checkout. Google Universal Analytics by 
Aromicon is compatible with Magento CE 1.4+ and Magento EE 1.10+. The module adds 
an appropriate script to the head or before the body end. You can download it free of 
charge.

Also see the Extendware Google Analytics Dashboard63. It helps you integrate the 
Google Analytics dashboard into the Magento back end.

If the methods described are not enough for you, read the following guidelines. The 
following five steps show how to implement all the ecommerce capabilities built into 
Google AdWords.
Magic with a new Universal Google Analytics Tracking Code
Get a new Universal Google Analytics tracking code and place it on your Magento store. 
Here are the steps to do so:
	
1.	
In the Google Analytics admin, find the Property column.
	
2.	
Choose the property that you’re going to work with.
	
3.	
Go to Tracking Info and select Tracking Code.
	
4.	
Copy and paste a new Universal GA tracking code into the 
source code of your website.
Every page of your Magento website has the html/head.phtml file with a child theme 
in it. You should paste the new code there before the closing tag. Don’t forget to place it 
on all the pages in your website; otherwise, data will be tracked imprecisely.
Use developer tools in a browser to check if the code was added in a proper way.
Preparation in Magento Admin 
Now you should enable the Google API in your Magento store. In admin, navigate to 
Configure, find Sales, and go to Google API. You can enable Google Analytics API there.
Adding Google Analytics Demographics to the Game 
Congratulations! You have implemented the standard Universal Google Analytics 
tracking code, but this is just the beginning. Unfortunately, you still don’t have the ability 
to see demographics data. Additional coding work is waiting for you next. Note that you 
will have to verify it under Audience-Demographics-Overview tab. I recommend that you 
check the following Google articles; each offers a detailed description of this process:
• 
Enable Remarketing and Advertising Reporting Features in 
Google Analytics
•

your tracking id.
	
8.	
Now it’s time to work in Magento Admin. Navigate to System 
➤ Configuration ➤ Google API ➤ Google Analytics. Paste 
your tracking id into the Account Number field.
	
9.	
Set Enable to Yes.
	
10.	
Save new configurations by clicking Save Config.
To properly use Google Tag Manager, check this setup guide. Note that you have to 
add basic page tracking. For third-party shopping carts and transaction tracking across 
separate domains, check this guide. Take into consideration that the feature is unnecessary 
if your ecommerce website and shopping cart software are on the same domain.
Keep in mind that you will have to work with JavaScript in order to collect ecommerce 
data from your website. Therefore, check this Google Analytics documentation on 
Ecommerce Tracking and this one on Enhanced Ecommerce Tracking.
To gather ecommerce data from Android and iOS apps, read this official 
documentation. I recommend that you check this post on an Internet-connected device, 
such as POS.
Setting up Conversion Tracking
In order to set up conversion tracking, take the following steps:
	
1.	
Go to the Account and Property columns in the Analytics admin.
	
2.	
Select your property.
	
3.	
Navigate to Tracking Info-Tracking Code.
	
4.	
Get a code.
	
5.	
Add it to the Magento HTML head in  
Configuration-Web-HTML Head.
However, you can also add the code manually, as follows:
	
1.	
With the aid of an FTP client, go to the /checkout/success.
phtml file.
	
2.	
Use an editor to open the file.

Chapter 1 ■ Setup
87
	
3.	
Place the GA tracking code in the bottom of this file.
	
4.	
Save and upload the file.
Test that everything is OK with the URLs. You can do it under Real Time-Conversions. 
If a particular goal is not working, you should navigate to Admin-Goals and check that the 
URLs are correct. Take into account that destination should be set to the final success page.
Google Webmasters Magento Integration
With Google_Webmasters, you will get all the necessary data and a set of tools for making 
your Magento store Google-friendly. If you rely on traffic from this search engine (and I 
know that you do), the Google Webmasters integration is inevitable. Next, I will show you 
two ways of Google Sitemap Magento Implementation.
How to Manually Create Google Sitemap in Magento 
The following explains How to Manually Create Google Sitemap in Magento
	
1.	
Log in to the Magento admin.
	
2.

Google AdWords Magento Integration
Next, I explain the benefits of Magento integration with AdWords and show how to 
connect both systems together.
Google AdWords management and conversion tracking shows the effectiveness 
of ad clicks. If your Magento website is connected to AdWords, you can easily get data 
about website purchases, app downloads, phone calls, newsletter sign-up, and other 
conversions. Invest in your ecommerce store wisely and optimize your campaigns 
according to business goals with the aid of AdWords. You can easily integrate your 
Magento store using the LUKA Google AdWords Conversion Tracking Magento extension.
The LUKA Google AdWords Conversion Tracking Magento extension simplifies 
integration with AdWords. You just have to install the module to enable Google AdWords 
Conversion Tracking on your Magento website. Check the source code of LUKA Google 
AdWords Conversion Tracking on GitHub here. Note that the module is absolutely free. 
Download LUKA Google AdWords Conversion Tracking Magento Extension.
How to Check a Conversion Tracking Tag
To verify if AdWords “sees” a conversion tracking tag, go to your AdWords account. Find 
the Tools option. From a drop-down menu, choose Conversions. The tracking status is 
specified in front of every conversion action in the “Tracking status” column. The tag can 
be one of the following:
• 
Unverified (Google hasn’t verified the tag on your website).
• 
No recent conversions (during previous 7 days).
• 
Recording conversions (everything is OK).
• 
Tag inactive (Google doesn’t see the tag).
• 
Removed (the name speaks for itself). Check this article for 
additional information.

Google Merchant Center Magento Integration
Google Merchant Center is a service, designed to help you with store and product 
information integration into Google Shopping. In order to work with the Google 
Merchant Center, you have to use your Google account or create a new one. Every Google 
account can be associated with only one Google Merchant Center account, but you can 
add extra users to your Google Base. At this stage, there are also two other conditions. 
Initially, you have to configure your account and choose your location and then agree to 
the Terms of Service.
Having set up your account and verified your website URL, you have to submit 
your product data. Before uploading any data files into Google Merchant Center, it is 
necessary to create and register your data feed—a file that includes attributes that define 
your products in a special way. The data feed is built like a classic RSS feed, but it also 
includes specific XML tags. Of course, you can perform all the actions manually, but there 
are numerous Magento extensions designed to simplify your interaction with Google 
Merchant Center; for example, Simple Google Shopping.
This module is established for exporting a well-structured and valid data feed 
from your Magento store to a Google Merchant account. Simple Google Shopping is 
highly configurable, easy to use, and provides support for several stores, VAT rates, and 
currencies. Get Simple Google Shopping Magento Extension.
The Google Shopping Feed extension is recommended by Google reps. Using this 
module you will be able to create a feed according to Google’s full specification. The 
main goal of the extension is to get as close as possible to a perfect data feed without 
maintaining it after the module’s installation. Download Google Shopping Feed Magento 
Extension.
By using the Magento Product Feed Generator, you have the ability to create product 
feeds for Google, eBay, and GetPrice. The extension supports CSV, XML, TXT, and other 
formats. With its aid, you can also get product details right from your admin. Get Magento 
Product Feed Generator Extension.
Using the Product Feed by Amasty Magento extension, you are able to generate a 
product feed in a short period of time (not more than few minutes). And it will take a day 
or two to put your products on high-traffic shopping platforms. Moreover, Product Feed 
by Amasty provides the opportunity to create an unlimited number of product feeds and 
separate them for all of your Magento store views. The extension works with Shopping.
com, Google.com, Getprice.com, Myshopping.com, Shopmania.com, Nextag.com, and 
Amazon.com. Purchase Product Feed by Amasty.
The Product Feed Creator/Shopping Feeds module is a feed generator that allows 
you to create custom data feeds and then submit them to various product search engines. 
Product Feed Creator generates feeds for Google Product Search, Amazon, Shopping.
com, Yahoo! Store, Channel Advisor, and dozens of other services. You can create 
feeds for your customers as well. This feature is useful for dropshipping and wholesale 
businesses. Get the extension.

Product Tags as a Powerful Cross Linking Tool
With the constant growth of information on the Internet, it’s becoming harder to sort it 
out by the various features. So, for example, if you find a picture of a nice pair of shoes 
and you decide to look for more like it, it will take you a lot of time, because you have no 
specific attributes for a search except for the shoes’ shape and color. Today, the problem 
seems to be solved thanks to a widespread use of so-called tags that play the role of 
peculiar labels that can be attributed to any online content. The main advantage of tags 
lies in their ability to specify the category of the content so that you can easily understand 
its origin, characteristics, and the reason for publishing.
Although tags are mostly used in social networks and bookmarking sites, they can be 
of particular interest to the ecommerce industry as well. For instance, if you use content 
tagging for your product marketing strategy, you can significantly increase your chances 
to attract a target audience to your website. There are a lot of possibilities with efficient 
product tagging that Magento retailers can adjust for their everyday needs, so I suggest 
getting acquainted with the main tagging principles and their application for every 
Magento store.
Public tagging allows users to apply various keywords to describe the content they see 
online. This type of tagging is widely used on bookmarking websites such as 9rules.com 
or Digg.com. For a website owner, having public tagging available means automatically 
getting your items indexed, which is important in terms of better search results rankings. 
Moreover, public tagging often suggests submitting links to particular content with a 
subsequent possibility of creating tags related to those links. After it’s done, it becomes 
possible for other users to find this content through entering tags in a search field.
In ecommerce retail, keyword research should be made first. Basically, a retailer 
has to understand which keywords are popular among the audience by checking their 
relevance in Google search requests. Furthermore, tags can become especially handy 
when dealing with a wide range of products. Although you can make traditional product 
categorization with the ability to search items by certain keywords, tagging allows you to 
set two or three keywords for each item that you have, so that if users click one of the tags, 
they are able to see the list of other items associated with the same keyword at once.
To make publisher tagging even more effective, you can also engage with book-
marking websites. For this you should only be able to offer something useful to your 
customers. This could be thematic articles or any other business-related content, 
including infographics, event announcements, and photographs. You should note, 
however, that submitting clearly commercial content to bookmarking websites won’t be 
appreciated by their owners and audience.
Thus, public and publisher tagging can be equally useful for satisfying your SEO 
needs, although the former should require proper quality control, and the latter, more 
thorough preliminary analysis of the relevant keywords.
The process of submitting links to content and connecting them with related tags is 
actively used in public and publisher tagging and can be actualized in various forms. In 
general, it can be called cross linking or internal link building. One of the most often used 
types of cross linking is a tag cloud, which is visually represented by a cluster of tagged 
keywords placed in a specific area of a website. Each tag in a cloud is in fact a separate 
link that directs the user to an internal search results list containing all the posts or items 
of the website where a tagged word or phrase is mentioned. Not only does this simplify 
the users’ site navigation process, but it also is a good SEO approach in general.

Now, your ecommerce store is almost ready for the first public launch, so it’s time for 
final preparations. Since your Magento website is installed and optimized for work, has 
high performance, incredible security, and good SEO, it’s time to learn more about the 
pre-launch checklist.
You can find a full article about tags here: http://goo.gl/yyLQ2o. To summarize the 
material, I’d like to show you two useful extensions associated with product tagging.
With the help of the SEO Product Tag URLs extension, you can make your product 
tag links more efficient for a search engine to interpret them. For instance, if your internal 
links lack any keywords and instead consists of strange sequences of letters and numbers, 
their search engine readability will be quite low. SEO Product Tag URLs solves this 
problem by converting all of your links into nicely tagged URLs that make it much easier 
for a searcher to get to your product pages. Download SEO Product Tag URLs.
Admin Product Tagging gives you the opportunity to add as many tags as you want 
to your product pages from the very beginning of creating those pages. Unlike default 
Magento managing tools, which only make it possible to add tags after a product page has 
been created, this extension allows you to add tags every time you decide to edit a page. 
The main advantage of the extension is that you don’t have to approve each new tag from 
the Admin panel individually. Rather, every newly created tag is automatically saved as 
approved. This, however, does not extend to user tagging, which means that all the public 
tags still have to be approved separately. But if you get tired of doing it all the time, there 
is an additional function in Admin Product Tagging with which you can simply disable 
tagging product pages by customers. Download Admin Product Tagging.

Pre-Launch Checklist
This is the final part of the chapter, which is based on the Complete Magento Pre-Launch 
Guide66. We all know that bringing any website live is a very stressful and responsible 
task, especially if it is a Magento ecommerce store. Your website should go live as soon as 
possible. At the same time, there are a lot of vital steps that you can easily forget about.  
If you don’t want to miss anything, read over the following list of pre-launch actions.
• 
Change the base URL. The core_config_data database table 
stores URLs that should be updated when you move your 
Magento website live; otherwise, they refer back to a staging site. 
You can access these URLs through admin interface here: System 
➤ Configuration ➤ Web. In this situation, it is essential not to 
miss a trailing forward slash.
• 
Improve SEO with new HTML head settings. The HTML head 
contains original settings. In order to improve your SEO, you 
should change them. Use your own title, set keywords, and 
metadescriptions. You can do this here: System ➤ Configuration 
➤ General ➤ Design ➤ HTML Head.
• 
Provide your visitors with relevant contact information. 
An ecommerce website without email addresses and store 
information looks suspicious. By missing this little step, you can 
frighten your future customers, so don’t make this mistake. Go to 
System ➤ Configuration ➤ General and System ➤ Configuration 
➤ Store Email Addresses. You can add all the necessary 
information there.
• 
Create a favicon. Don’t start your ecommerce store without 
having created a favicon. It will still work if you forget about this 
step, but that does not mean that you should overlook having a 
favicon.
• 
Take care of placeholder images. If a product doesn’t have an 
image, a placeholder image is used instead. You should create a 
set of such images for your store. You can upload them in System 
➤ Configuration ➤ Catalog ➤ Product Image Placeholders. 
Alternatively, you can place them in catalog/products/
placeholder/image.jpg (small_image.jpg and thumbnail.jpg).
• 
Improve your security with a custom admin URL. The default 
Magento path to admin is insecure because everyone knows it. 
Luckily, you can always change it. Just go to the local.xml file and 
replace the admin frontname in the admin router with a custom 
one. Don’t forget to delete cache before visiting a new URL.

Chapter 1 ■ Setup
93
• 
Provide your buyers with nice invoices. All the information on 
your Magento website should look good. The invoices should also 
look good. Thus, take care of the logo. You should upload it to an 
appropriate folder.
• 
Offer transactional emails with the correct logo. It’s not a 
surprise that transactional and default emails use different logos. 
Therefore, you should save the correct image (logo_email.gif) in 
the theme directory. Note that there are Magento themes that are 
based on hard-coded values and require manual changes.
• 
Customize your 404 page. What do you feel when you see a 
404 page? You are a little bit disappointed, right? So are your 
customers. Don’t make them more disappointed with the default 
Magento block—customize your 404 page. Go to CMS ➤ Pages 
and make it better.
• 
Customize the error page. Prevent your customers from seeing 
a default Magento error page. Adapt this page to the current 
Magento template by modifying files from the error directory. 
Additionally, you can disable stack trace printing. Open the 
errors/local.xml file and replace the print action with email. Set 
an email address.
• 
Don’t forget about test data. You’ve probably created a lot of 
test data while testing your Magento store. Before going live, you 
should remove it. Products, orders, and customers created during 
development should be deleted.
• 
Check tax settings. Go to System ➤ Configuration ➤ Sales ➤ Tax 
to check your current tax settings. You can also use appropriate 
Magento extensions to optimize these settings for certain markets. 
Go to Magento Connect or check this blog post to find suitable 
tools.
• 
Set the shipping origin. Parallel to tax settings, you should set a 
shipping origin. Various countries require a different approach in 
providing the appropriate tax rates.
• 
Import the right product inventory. Make sure that the 
necessary configurations are set up. Note that you may have to 
perform an additional import of stock levels.
• 
Check shipping methods. Make sure that fixed products, cart 
fees, or other related features are configured. In a cart weight 
route, make sure that the weight is attached to all products.
• 
Improve performance with this simple step. Flush JavaScript 
to a single file in order to reduce load time. Go to System ➤ 
Configuration ➤ Developer ➤ JavaScript Settings and perform 
all the required actions there. Keep in mind that inline JavaScript 
requires its own file to avoid page load slowdown.

Chapter 1 ■ Setup
94
• 
Don’t ignore CSS minification. You can always use a CSS 
compressor to minify CSS data. Create a minified version in 
addition to a readable one.
• 
Consider this additional advice on CSS. You can also combine 
your CSS files into a single one—just like in a JavaScript case. 
Take into consideration that this feature doesn’t work well with 
all Magento websites. I recommend that you check it on a staging 
server before going live, since it can have some unwanted side 
effects. Go to System ➤ Configuration ➤ Developer ➤ CSS 
Settings to flush CSS into a single file. Or you can use the Fooman 
Speedster Magento extension. It functions with both CSS and 
JavaScript files.
• 
Use the maintenance.flag. Go to the root of your Magento 
installation and find the maintenance.flag file. It displays a 
holding page during your going online. Move the maintenance.
flag file first, queueing the rest of Magento to transfer.
• 
Inevitable index management. Please note that after performing 
any catalog changes, you should also re-index.
• 
Utilize the power of system compilation. Reduce the load time 
of your ecommerce store by compiling the system. This will lead 
to a 50% performance increase in loading a page. You can find the 
necessary settings here at System ➤ Tools ➤ Compilation.
• 
Enable caching. Caching is usually disabled during the 
development stage. Thus, you should enable and refresh it before 
going live; otherwise, you will decrease the performance of your 
website.
• 
Integrate your store with Google Analytics. Magento supports 
integration with Google Analytics. You just have to set up your 
account and put its number in System ➤ Configuration ➤ Sales 
➤ Google API ➤ Google Analytics.
… and with Google Base
Google Base integration is also supported by Magento. Check this article by Inchoo to 
find out more about this process.
• 
Improve your SEO with Google Sitemap. Go to “Catalog-Google 
Sitemap” and select “Create Sitemap.” With the help of Webmaster 
Tools, point Google toward your sitemap.
• 
Test how newsletter subscriptions work. Do not test this feature 
on real customers. It’s better to check how it works before going 
live. Test the opportunity to sign up and unsubscribe. Check 
whether newsletters can be sent out.

Chapter 1 ■ Setup
95
• 
Make sure that your payment gateways work. It is extremely 
important to check that a payment gateway is ready to go live with 
your store; otherwise, you can lose the first customers. Enable 
SSL Certificate because many payment gateways will not function 
without this security feature.
• 
Go live with all Magento extensions. Some modules from 
Magento Connect will not work without a license key. In order 
to go live with them, you should check if every key is still valid. 
Obtain new keys if necessary.
• 
Take care of unnecessary modules. Your ecommerce store 
probably doesn’t need all default Magento features. Therefore, 
you can easily disable them. Go to System ➤ Configuration ➤ 
Advanced and turn off everything that you don’t need.
• 
Enable product import/export with right PHP configurations. 
Keep in mind that the memory_limit and max_execution_time 
files should have only reasonable values. Restrictive values are 
often a reason of a product import/export fail.
• 
Don’t forget to turn on crons. Some Magento components 
require regular updates, which run due to periodical scripts. You 
can find the needed configurations in System ➤ Configuration ➤ 
Advanced ➤ System. To modify the cron.php file, go to the root 
of your Magento installation. Check this page for a more detailed 
description of the process.
• 
Clean logs. A database that contains logs becomes bloated. 
Thus, you have to clean it from time to time. You can even set a 
daily cleaning. The appropriate option is situated in System ➤ 
Configuration ➤ Advanced ➤ System ➤ Log cleaning.
• 
Regularly backup your store. You can use the Automatic 
Database Backup Magento extension. This module will do 
everything for you. Just go to Magento Connect, install it, and get 
your backups.
Final Words About Performance
Before going live, test the performance of your site. As mentioned, a fast ecommerce store 
not only makes customers loyal, but also provides a positive impact on SEO. There are 
dozens of tools and extensions designed for checking the performance of your Magento 
website. You can use GTMetrix, YSlow, or any other convenient solution to find bottlenecks 
and fix them. Remember, your visitors always compare your store to other websites; that’s 
why they will move to a competitor if you provide them with a low performance.

For the More Curious 
If these checklists are not enough for you, see this blog post. That Magento Pre-Launch 
Checklist includes some additional advice.
Magento Store Audit
In brick-and-mortar retail, a store audit is an examination of information about the 
effectiveness of different parameters, such as price, sales, or advertising campaign 
compared to that of any competitors or common standards. As for ecommerce in general 
and Magento in particular, this process is more complicated, since it consists of a wider 
number of variables that require different approaches in calculation. Luckily, there are 
a lot of tools and materials that can help you with a Magento store audit. The following 
guide offers a store audit checklist, resources, and techniques necessary for running the 
procedure. Being useful for all kinds of Magento specialists and store owners, it teaches 
how to estimate efforts, collect information about your Magento website, and keep the 
installation clean and healthy.
When it comes to auditing a Magento website, the first difference from a  
brick-and-mortar store audit is the necessity to measure a site speed. That’s where 
PageSpeed Insights67, a product from the Google Developers kit, is helpful.
The next important difference is security. Although you can examine the safety of a 
brick-and-mortar store, this parameter is not as important as in ecommerce. In Magento, 
a store audit requires finding and fixing various security vulnerabilities. Chances are your 
website lacks some crucial patches or has other holes. You can find all of these security 
problems with the aid of MageReport, a free service that gives you a quick insight into the 
security status of your Magento store. Besides showing all current security problems, the 
service teaches you how to fix possible vulnerabilities.
Although the idea behind Mage Scan is to evaluate the security and quality of a 
Magento website, you don’t have access to further work with a potential developer or a 
new client, you can easily utilize Mage Scan68 in a Magento website audit.
Toolbox for Magento Shop Audit is another vital software solution. With the 
generate-reports.sh script, you can get various reports on a Magento installation. All of 
these reports are a vital foundation in a Magento website audit.
Toolbox for Magento Shop Audit requires copying files from its repository69 right into 
your Magento installation. Then, you can easily run the script and get all the necessary 
data. The script downloads a clean Magento source from the Magento website to run the 
audit. The following are some useful articles related to the topic:

Conclusion
Your Magento website is now live, but don’t expect that this is the end of your 
development process. Chances are that your ecommerce store contains bugs, so you 
should be ready to discover and fix them as soon as possible. There are also a lot of SEO, 
performance, and security improvements to be implemented.
I strongly recommend that you create two separate versions of your Magento store. 
One should be directed at public, while the other one should become your laboratory. If 
experiments are successful and you are content with your results, push an improvement 
online. Thus, your customers won’t see your fails, but your store will always get useful 
updates and fixes. What are these updates and fixes? I describe all of them in this book. 
Growth is the next step in your ecommerce development.

CHAPTER 2
Sales Generation
The newcomers on the field of ecommerce often tend to have problems with gaining 
enough traffic to their websites. It is quite difficult to attract customers if nobody 
even knows about your existence. Since making a profit online requires a lot of time, 
investments, planning, and management, you have to be patient and consistent to get 
your website out of the Google search abyss and increase your website traffic. In this 
chapter, I’ll shed light on the most effective ways of sales generation in the context of a 
successful marketing campaign.
Evaluate Your Marketing Campaign
With the ecommerce industry exceeding $294 billion of profit in 2014, it is not surprising 
that digital commerce is worth being called a competitive market. This, however, must 
call for more actions, because retailers, who think that their marketing strategy can 
bring money steadily for years, are going to lose everything just within several months. 
Ecommerce marketing nowadays is a tough job requiring a lot of effort.
The most effective way of maintaining your business on the highest level is a 
constant control over the success of your current strategies, and if they fail in fulfilling 
a plan—the invention of better ones. Therefore, get ready for an intensive study of 
planning, implementing, and evaluating your marketing campaigns.

Chapter 2 ■ Sales Generation

Understand Your Goals
If you’re not really sure what you want to reach with your marketing campaign, you will 
not succeed in it anyway. Even if you spend a great amount of money on numerous ads, 
believing that this is a successful campaign, you’re wrong. Thus, it’s important to make a 
clear plan of what you want to achieve by your strategy—for instance:
• 
Reach 1,000 orders per month
• 
Obtain 500 new customers
• 
Increase growth in revenues by 30%
Identify Metrics for Measuring Your Campaign
At the end of the first period, you can start measuring the results of a current strategy. 
For each aim established at the beginning, you will have to utilize appropriate metrics to 
calculate their value. For instance, if your aim was to gain more sales to your website, the 
following rates must be considered:
• 
Average number of product page views
• 
Percentage ratio of users that purchased your products to all users 
that viewed your website during a certain period
• 
Sum of total revenue
Implement Comfortable Metrics Tracking
Active ads allows you to easily monitor the number of visitors coming to your website and 
mostly all the activities performed by these visitors through the toolkit of your particular 
ad campaign. Thus, you’re open to control all stages of a potential purchase from the 
very first view of a page to a complete product purchase. In fact, by using your ad stats, 
you will get the exact rates for performing final calculations. For example, to calculate an 
overall conversion rate of a particular product, you may simply divide the number of its 
purchases by the number of product page views for a given period.
Be Original with All Media Representation on Your Site
For each ad campaign, you should use different visual solutions to perfectly suit the social 
environment that you want to integrate your website with. For instance, if you create an 
ad on Facebook, make sure to use an unusual color scheme or imagery that is likely to 
attract the major audience of the network to your website. Sometimes you will even have 
to be minimalistic if you don’t want to spoil your customers’ impressions.

Chapter 2 ■ Sales Generation
101
Use UTM Links to Direct Users to the Most Suitable Page
If you create ads on several websites or platforms, it would be nice if you could see which 
of them brings the greatest amount of customers. Thus, you can utilize UTM links, which 
are basically specific parameters assigned to the main link. They can help you with 
tracking the number of clicks performed on every ad, as well as analyzing their efficiency 
in your primary campaign.
There are numerous tools for creating UTM links, such as Google URL Builder 
and Terminus, but while the former is considered to be relatively easy to use, the latter 
contains a set of more advanced settings for experienced retailers.
The following are the main UTM parameters for adjusting to an ad link:
• 
Source (website at which your ad is located, e.g., Facebook)
• 
Medium (variation of your banner, e.g., banner variation 1)
• 
Campaign (name of your ad campaign, e.g., autumn collection)
The result should look like what’s shown on the following web page:
http://yoursite.com/blog-post-fall-collection/?utm_source=facebook&utm_
medium=bannerverisio campaign=autumncollection
Add such link to all of your ads and publish it only if you’re sure that it works properly.
Run Some Tests Before Publishing Your Ads
It is important to test how UTM links work and whether they direct users to the right place. 
Try to produce all the actions of a potential customer, starting with clicking ads, browsing 
various product pages, and ending with checkout. Then, go to your tracking page and see 
whether the metrics change their values. If everything is fine, proceed to the next step.
See the Results
In order to provide yourself with a convenient way of tracking your metrics, you can use 
several handy tools that will help you understand whether your goals are achievable. The 
following are the best solutions:
• 
KISSmetrics: A flexible medium for effective tracking of major 
campaign rates.
• 
Google Analytics: Good at dealing with UTM links.
• 
Converto: A more advanced tool that offers the ability to analyze 
the efficiency of all of your ads and redirect your resources to 
more profitable channels.
Keep in mind that even if your campaign fails, with these analytical add-ons at hand, 
you should identify which rates appear to be insufficient and calculate current losses. 
Using official ad tools on your advertising channels is also possible, but it often happens 
that rate values are different from what you might expect.

Chapter 2 ■ Sales Generation
102
Make a Conclusion and Prepare for Further Campaigns
However, getting results is not your final destination. In addition to evaluating your 
campaign achievements, you should analyze each of your advertising channels to 
define which of them gained the biggest audience. For instance, you may discover that 
Facebook gave you 500 page views, among which 50 were purchases. Thus, I can suggest 
that Facebook is likely to be effective for attracting customers, but certain modifications 
to your ad campaign on this platform are required. If your Twitter ad campaign brought 
you just 200 page views, but 150 of those ones still ended up completing an order, this ad 
source is worth investing in. Those ad sources that brought you nothing but a few page 
views for the whole period should be discarded.
Finally, learn all of your achievements and failures from the current marketing 
strategy, so that the next time you can apply this knowledge to getting your business to 
the top positions in the ecommerce market.
The Main Traffic Sources
As a retailer, you might be curious about what traffic sources can bring you the desired 
number of customers. In fact, everything depends on the size of your business. For 
instance, it is not profitable for a small store to rely on direct traffic, so you have to look for 
other alternatives to achieve your marketing goals. Let’s look at some traffic sources and 
define their pros and cons.
Direct Traffic
Direct traffic is a flow of users who come to your website by typing in the direct URL 
address in their browsers. To make this source valuable for you, it is important to become 
a popular brand offline and provide people with the ability to engage with you and 
your products by actually going to your brick-and-mortar stores. In this case, all the 
investments must be made for a high-quality PR scheme and the opening of an offline 
store chain. The principle disadvantage of this source is that it can only bring 10% to 15% 
of visitors. Besides, if you’re generally doing well with your offline business, you can look 
for more advanced ways of driving extra traffic to your online store.
Email Marketing
This traffic source is considered to be one of the cheapest ones. Furthermore, it can 
be used for all possible kinds of business. The main priority of email marketing is the 
ability to keep in touch with the existing customers and encourage them to make more 
purchases from your online store. This traffic source requires the following three factors.
Sufficient Database Volume
This means that you should have an adequate number of users to whom you will send 
your emails to. You can either buy data or build it yourself. Buying data can be fast 

Chapter 2 ■ Sales Generation
103
and easy, but it does not guarantee that users will react—after all, they don’t know 
you, so you’re likely to be marked as spam. Building your own email list may seem 
more reasonable, but it usually takes a good deal of time to attract enough customers, 
especially if you’ve just started your business. However, you can use organic ways to 
encourage visitors to share their email addresses with you. This includes creating visual 
incentives, for instance, that offer bargains on your items to subscribed users.
Frequent eMail Delivery
Any type of email marketing campaign suggests that you should provide a regular email 
delivery to your contact list users. However, this regularity should not exceed three 
letters a month, because frequent emailing will cause people, as well as email services, to 
consider you as a spammer. When a smart email service, such as Gmail, identifies you as a 
spammer, your emails are automatically sent to a spam folder, which prevents a recipient 
from even noticing it. Thus, you should be consistent but unobtrusive while gaining traffic.
Appropriate Quality of eMail Content
When it comes to building up content for your emails, use information that can only 
be found on your website. Goods and prices that don’t exist on your Magento store will 
disappoint potential customers. Don’t make your emails too long—write only about the 
most relevant things that will make people interested in what you are doing. It’s often 
useful to combine textual content with catchy images to make it more user-friendly. For 
instance, you can write four or five sentences to describe your content and then support 
them with a relevant picture representing your offer. Apart from the things mentioned, I 
recommend adding corresponding links to your website.
Thus, you should manage email marketing during the first days of your website 
existence. Providing yourself with an opportunity to bring your customers back at any 
particular time can double your conversions and create friendly relationships between 
you and your customers. Although email marketing accounts for 10% to 30% of visitors, it 
won’t work for acquiring new customers, because you are unlikely to interest people who 
have never purchased your products.
Apart from independent research and testing opportunities of your email marketing 
campaigns, you can also utilize the services of specialized email marketing providers. They 
can consult you (often for free) and give useful advice on how to get along with this source of 
traffic. The price for paid services varies, depending on whether you want to save your time 
and make the whole process run automatically or manage everything yourself. MailChimp is 
a service that combines a set of valuable ecommerce features at a reasonable price.
MailChimp
For a minimum of $10 per month, you can get high-end email content that will be 
appealing to your customers. Moreover, you can also take advantage of regular analytics 
reports that inform you about the current progress of your email campaign. With 
MailChimp’s functionality, you will be able to easily improve your marketing performance 
by utilizing a set of its useful features, such as those described next.

Email Designer
Email Designer is an all-in-one editor that is based on drag-and-drop principle. It can 
be managed from a PC or a laptop, as well as from a tablet or a smartphone. Its built-in 
toolkit allows to do the following:
• 
Edit and resize images.
• 
Effectively interact with your team no matter where you are.
• 
Conduct a testing campaign before actually launching it.
• 
Store and retrieve your files in a specialized file manager.
• 
Automatically verify every link you submit to emails.
• 
Email templates.
MailChimp offers a smart collection of predesigned templates that you can use if you 
lack enough time or experience to create a good-looking design. So the only thing you 
have to do is submit the content and check how it looks with each particular template. 
If you intend to code your own email template, there is the Email Template Reference 
option that has a lot of useful information and recommendations on how to make a nice 
working template for a successful email marketing scheme.
Smart Reports
When your campaign is finally on the go, you can instantly start monitoring its 
performance through MailChimp’s smart reports, which provide you with detailed data, 
such as the number of newly subscribed users, URL visits, and impressions.
Integration with eCommerce Platforms
If you want to reach various categories of customers with equal efficiency, you need to 
import all user data to your MailChimp account. Take into consideration that the service 
supports integration with Google Analytics, Magento, and Shopify.
There are three plans available for acquisition on MailChimp: Entrepreneur, Growing 
Business, and High Volume Sender.
The Entrepreneur package is free of charge and has no expiration date. You can 
send a fixed number of 12,000 emails to 2,000 users each month. Also, you can sort your 
customer list to manage email delivery to target groups of customers. The plan supports 
ecommerce integration and the access to the pack of ready-to-use email templates. The 
downside of this plan is in the lack of support for analytical tools for monitoring website 
traffic. The Entrepreneur package is intended for small businesses that don’t have a 
large audience; this guarantees that every user will receive at least one email per month. 
If you acquire more than 2,000 users, you will need to subscribe for a paid plan, which 
widens the functionality of your account and allows you to send an unlimited number of 
messages. It will cost you only $10 per month.

Chapter 2 ■ Sales Generation
105
The Growing Business plan supports unlimited monthly email delivery to 600,000 
subscribers. You can use MailChimp1 for calculating an actual amount of money required 
for a given number of users per month. For instance, a plan for up to 5,000 users will cost 
you $50, while a plan for 10,000 costs $75. The same pricing works for the High Volume 
Sender package as well. The plan supports customer list segmentation and integration 
with ecommerce platforms. Additionally, you get an opportunity to manage your 
teamwork by using Email Designer and you have a regularly available consulting team of 
experts to help you adapt the MailChimp system within your ecommerce store.
The High Volume Seller package suits large corporations with wide audiences 
(600,000 customers). It offers the ability to send billions of emails per month. You can 
automatically adjust your delivery due to provider responses and protect data with a 
two-factor authentication process, SOC II, and PCI DSS certifications and security alerts. 
There is also access to a full API, provided with detailed documentation and user guides. 
In addition, the package features multi-user accounts for agencies to manage their 
cooperative engagement and interaction with clients.

These are results displayed to a user after he enters a search request. The first results 
usually contain the most relevant information, which is more likely to meet search 
requirements. That’s why organic search results almost never include advertising links 
in the top results. Even Google tries to divide relevant result links from ads, putting 
the former in the first place and moving the latter down to the lower positions. This 
means that placing your website among the first positions requires high popularity 
among people, or original and rare products and services that won’t create excessive 
competitiveness on the Internet. In addition to the things mentioned, you need an 
effective SEO strategy.
In general, organic search results bring from 10% to 30% of visitors on a regular basis.
Paid Search Results
Paid search results, if used properly, can provide you with up to 50% of visitors, which 
is the highest rate among all traffic drivers. This source of customers usually requires a 
sufficient number of resources to be spent, since advertising tends to become more and 
more complicated in attracting people’s attention. In a perfect scenario, you should be 
able to invest in both offline and online stores to gain maximum profit from the paid 
search. Online marketing campaigns usually include the following methods: SEO,  
pay-per-click ads, and affiliate marketing.

Search Engine Optimization
This technique is considered to be the most popular for increasing website traffic because 
it cannot attain crazy numbers of visits. Please note that it usually takes months until SEO 
strategy shows its results, so you will need consistency and patience to gain the desired 
traffic flow to your website.
Although the main SEO optimizations are described in the first chapter of this book, 
I’d like to draw your attention to this complicated process once again. The main issue 
related to search engine optimization is content, which means that you have to work on 
the effectiveness of your texts and product listings. The whole procedure includes the 
following:
• 
Check and improve your product categories. Make sure that 
every product contains a sufficient amount of keywords (words 
and word-phrases that users are likely to type in when they search 
for these products on Google or any other search engine). Then, 
include these keywords in the most noticeable places of your 
website: headers, item descriptions, image names, internal links, 
and the body text itself.
• 
Make your text authentic. Work with professional writers that 
will make your descriptions, articles, and other text pieces 
readable and informative for potential customers. Your main aim 
is to put the most relevant information in the proper order.
• 
Utilize landing pages. Primarily, a landing page is a single 
website page that contains relevant and crucial data for a viewer. 
For instance, you can create a customer-specific link that will 
direct a person from a search results page or an ad toward a 
certain product page containing a description, characteristics, 
and price. This is likely to motivate a user to make a purchase.
• 
Ask bloggers and other retailers to mention your store on 
their websites. This part is the most difficult one, because 
further success of your marketing campaign becomes in some 
sense dependent on whether your website URL appears on other 
blogs or pages. It makes sense to be friendly in order to become 
successful.
• 
Submit your website to various directories. Google, Bing, and 
Business.com must be your primary candidates.
Pay-Per-Click Advertising
The pay-per-click ads are really good at increasing your website traffic faster than any 
other alternative solution. This technology allows you to buy visitors on the websites 
where you place your ads. Once users click your ad, they are instantly redirected to your 
website. As an advertiser, you have to pay website owners for every single click.

Chapter 2 ■ Sales Generation
107
The most popular pay-per-click management service is Google AdWords, which can 
bring you about 70% of paid search visitors. But before using it, you should learn all the 
opportunities related to this pay-per-click solution. Note that the service is full of other 
retailers—many of who occupy the top positions in search results.
• 
Analyze the number of retailers that sell the same goods as you.
• 
Make the most powerful set of keywords for your product ads.
• 
Work on the appearance of your ads (design, colors, images, etc.)
• 
Adjust retargeting ads for your website. Retargeting ads are 
basically the same old ads but their aim is to track your website 
visitors’ after they have left a website page. For instance, when a 
person goes to your website, nothing happens, but as soon as he 
or she proceeds to other websites, your ad will be displayed on 
each of these sites.
• 
Note that cost-per-click, or CPC, options are always better than 
cost-per-mille, or CPM, options. Don’t pay for viewers—pay for 
their actions, especially if your goal is to capture leads.
• 
Your ads should have URLs with a unique tracking token. Thus, 
you will be able to test them and evaluate their effectiveness. 
Without this information, you will never optimize your ROI.
• 
The writing style of your landing page and an advertisement on 
social media should correspond to one another. At least, try to use 
the same language; otherwise, you’ll confuse your customers.
• 
Provide high-quality content: avoid typos (if they are not a part of 
your creative campaign), make sure that every image has a proper 
size and check that every URL goes to the right landing pages.
• 
Use A/B testing and try out different types of ads. This will help 
you choose better options and get the most out of your PPC 
campaign.
It is also worth mentioning that pay-per-click management works in social network 
environments, including Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook. Even more surprising is that 
you can use pay-per-click ads on mobile devices.
Affiliate Marketing
Affiliate marketing includes interaction with third-party websites that will definitely 
come in handy when it comes to driving traffic to your store. Basically, these sites use the 
same methods about selling your products “on their territory,” but it will require extra 
expenditures (about 10%) from every sale they make. The most reliable affiliate websites 
are Affiliate Window, Linkshare, and Webgain.
Unfortunately, dealing with affiliates involves additional investments into the 
development of specific data feeds obtained from your product database. These data 

Chapter 2 ■ Sales Generation
108
feeds will be integrated into the affiliate’s own database to enable ordering of your 
products on their website. Moreover, additional banners and newsletters that will be 
distinguishable from those you use on other advertising platforms are required. Keep in 
mind that you can track user activity on affiliate websites by using the Google Analytics 
platform.
The Best Magento Affiliate Modules

previously defined rules. This pay-per-sale system seems to be quite reliable, especially if 
you cannot be sure about the loyalty of your companions. You can download this module 
for only $99.
The Auguria Sponsorship module is based on a sponsorship earning system 
that allows gaining special points that can be further sold or exchanged among your

product. The module can be acquired for $149 on the developer’s official website.

Other Useful Traffic-Driving Techniques…
…to Use on Your Website
Simplified Checkout
Approximately 50% of all abandoned check-out processes are caused by complex and 
unfriendly shopping experiences. The lengthier and more complex this process is, the 
less inclined customers are to make a purchase. To increase sales, try to simplify the 
checkout experience:
• 
Choose the most user-friendly template for your shopping cart options.
• 
Simplify a sign-in process for returning customers.
• 
Reduce overall checkout time by uniting closely related data in 
one checkout step.

Chapter 2 ■ Sales Generation
111
Full Shipping Information
This concerns mostly information about shipping costs. When a customer literally bumps 
into a shipping price at the final step of his or her order completion, it often spoils a 
previously settled positive mood. The same happens when a shipping price is not exact, 
with a myriad of additional conditions and restrictions suggesting that the final sum is a 
subject to vary significantly. Therefore, complex shipping costs and conditions increase 
the number of failed checkout processes.
The most reliable solution in this case is to put shipping information at the first steps 
of your checkout procedure and make the price as low as possible to avoid discouraging 
positive expectations of customers.
Mobile-Friendly Environment
There is almost nobody who doesn’t have access to a mobile device these days, and there 
is a huge number of people that spend much more time surfing the Internet from their 
smartphones and tablets than laptops or computers. This must call you for adapting the 
universal trend and optimizing your website for smartphones and tablets. Providing your 
customers with an intuitive mobile shopping experience will greatly increase your traffic 
and sales.
Giveaways
Everybody likes getting things for free, and you can use this tendency to attract attention 
of potential customers. It can be anything ranging from supporting mobile apps and 
extensions to handy accessories and packaging services.
Feedback Opportunities
About 80% of all customers tend to make their purchasing decisions based on 
reviews they read on retail websites. The most important thing is that reviews and 
recommendations can be used by consumers in order to provide additional information 
about your products to their colleagues and friends, making them even more valuable for 
retailers. Moreover, having reviews available makes your website generally more reliable 
in comparison with those that don’t have this option. But in order to make it more 
effective, don’t hesitate to ask your customers for a feedback—not everyone is apt to leave 
it after purchasing a product.
Although reviews can be positive and negative, you must be ready to see both types 
on your website. It’s not always the case that your products or services must be bad, 
though. But the reason for bad feedback doesn’t matter—think of it like of a factor that 
can help you boost your market performance and increase overall traffic to your website.
These techniques are also important when estimating the conversion rate of your 
website. Abandoned shopping carts, zero returns from email campaigns, and absence 
of feedback from your customers are the main factors affecting your conversion rate. 
Because this value plays the main part in determining how good your relationships with 
existing customers are, you will also have to be ready to take steps toward a conversion 
rate optimization strategy.

…to Use Outside of Your Website
Don’t Give up on Traditional Advertising
Although we live in the age of computers, it doesn’t mean that we cannot use old-school 
methods anymore. It also concerns advertising, however controversial this sphere may 
be. Traditional advertising is still actualized through magazines, newspapers, direct mail 
marketing, radio stations, TV, and even billboards. Moreover, it can also increase your 
website traffic!
Consider such giants as Zappos, Diapers.com, Bonobos, and Amazon. Although they 
are hugely popular on the Internet, these companies still rely on traditional advertising to 
keep their sales and website views high.
Entertain Your Customers
Using entertainment as a source of new traffic may seem an odd thing, but it really 
works. Try to turn on your imagination and think of content that could bring you more 
customers because it is funny. One of the most commonly used entertaining elements in 
the sphere of ecommerce is a viral video. Viral videos are made by many world-famous 
brands, and their efficiency is considered proven due to the enormous success they 
achieve afterward. Some brands even adjust themselves to YouTube and create official 
channels where they promote their products by introducing them in a row of funny or 
creative video series.
Take Part in Offline Events
This might be especially useful if you have only an online store that has been recently 
launched. Apart from using traditional ways of ecommerce marketing, you can simply 
attend various offline fairs and other sales events to get people acquainted with your 
products and services. Accompany your attendance with original and colorful leaflets 
and product samples—use all possible ways to make people visit your online store.
Expose Your Business to Other eCommerce Platforms
If you don’t feel yet stable enough with traffic, don’t hesitate to promote your products 
on bigger ecommerce platforms such as Amazon and eBay. Millions of people visit these 
sites every day, so it’s likely that they will stumble upon your products for being original, 
cheap, or both.
Use Banner Ads
This is another efficient technique for driving traffic to your Magento website. Since it is 
quite complicated, I’ve decided to devote a separate part of this chapter to banner ads. 
You can read about it next.

Chapter 2 ■ Sales Generation
113
Banner Ads
This type of advertisement must be familiar to every ecommerce retailer, but many of 
them do not consider it as effective as previously thought. First, because modern users 
are highly knowledgeable about computers and specifically the Internet, it’s not that easy 
to attract their attention anymore. The only reaction people experience when seeing 
an ad is utter irritation, because their presence on a website is dictated by the need to 
read/watch something interesting or to communicate with somebody, not to click some 
crazy-colored suspicious banners. As a result, retailers develop more original approaches 
and switch to more complicated banners, but the strategy still crashes due to ad blocking 
software that is popular among users all over the world. In spite of these unpleasant facts 
about banner ads, there is still a green light for retailers to use them for driving traffic to 
their websites. Next, I tell you how to use them properly.
How to Use
Considering current problems related to banner ads, you will come to a conclusion that 
it’s almost impossible to make a profit from using them. But here are the key conditions 
observe to make your banner ads work:
• 
Define a list of websites relevant to your audience. If you think 
that having an ad everywhere can improve your situation, you’re 
highly mistaken.
• 
Spend more time making your ads creative. Creativity still attracts 
attention, as it can be beautiful, entertaining, smart, and eye-
catching.
• 
Conduct some tests before submitting your banner ad. If it 
does not work properly or it cannot be monitored from tracking 
services, it’s better to fix all these problems before investing in it.
• 
Contact potential banner ad publishers directly. Being able to 
communicate with website owners is a useful skill that provides 
the most favorable advertising conditions. You should sound 
natural and generous. These owners are basically the influencers 
of your products, so the more contacts you have, the more 
successful your banner ad campaign.
• 
Be aware of the F-shaped view pattern. This is a general page 
view pattern and a common feature for everyone browsing the 
Internet. According to it, users tend to look at the top of a page 
first, then explore the content itself starting from a left side, 
proceeding to a right side and then back, then go to the middle, 
do the same left-right manipulations, and so on. You can use the 
knowledge of the F-shaped pattern to find the best place for your 
banner ads. Accordingly, it will be either the top of the page or its 
left side. Unfortunately, when dealing with ad publishers, you will 
only have to rely on their own ad placement priorities.

Chapter 2 ■ Sales Generation
114
• 
Enhance your landing pages, since they are important for all 
kinds of online ads due to the ability to direct users to the most 
desirable places of your website, either already existing or newly 
created ones. The main purpose of a landing page is to incline 
users to buy your goods. Thus, it’s up to you where you place the 
landing page on your Magento store.
Where to Buy
Basically, you have to choose among two kinds of banner ads sources—individual 
publishers or ad networks.
Individual Publishers
If you already have a list of potential banner ad publishers dealing with a similar market 
segment, contact with their owners or advertising operators. Learn their prices and 
subscription conditions, and decide how long you are going to work with them. Keep in 
mind that if you advertise on a particular website for a long time, you may become easily 
recognizable by its audience and therefore more trustful. Therefore, you can obtain a 
stable number of loyal customers. But it does not mean that you don’t have to update 
your ads and their design regularly.
Ad Networks
Ad networks are not niche-specific banner ad resources, but can be considered as a 
competitive alternative to direct ad publishers. Ad networks are usually a third party that 
chooses the websites to publish your banner ads on. Thus, they can save you time by 
performing all the work instead of you. As for the down side, it is harder to drive traffic 
to your store, and you are not able to communicate with publishers directly. The most 
popular ad network is AdWords.
AdWords
AdWords is Google’s official advertising program that is commonly used by businesses 
all over the world. It’s the first thing you’re advised to try in your never-ceasing attempts 
to get more traffic to your website. With the help of this program, you can manage your 
ads and choose the most appealing websites to place them on. The main advantage of 
the service is its relatively low cost and easy break-up procedure. In addition, you can 
adjust the program so that your ads are seen only by local users, especially when you 
tend to attract more customers to your physical store. You also can place your ad right 
on a Google results page; thus, users can go directly to the product page that they are 
interested in.

Chapter 2 ■ Sales Generation
115
How It Functions
Keyword is a basic element of the AdWords toolkit that allows you to place your website 
ads near the first positions of a Google search results list. You should simply create a 
range of the most relevant keywords based on your business activity or products. Be 
specific when choosing the most important keywords and give priority to two-to-three 
word phrases rather than simple words.
It is also important to mention that AdWords can show your ads on other websites 
sharing Google-owned properties (like YouTube), as well as Google’s partner sites (like 
NYTimes.com or Families.com). The place on the website used for showing your ad is 
called placement.
AdRank is an additional value of AdWords that is used to determine your ad’s position 
on a website or among search results. It also determines whether your ad will be displayed 
at all. You should remember, though, that the main factors defining ad’s location are the 
amount of bids you offer (the sum you’re ready to spend) and the quality of your ad. As 
a result, the first and the most prominent positions in the list are given to the ads with 
highest bids and quality. What’s even more interesting about AdRank is its ability to 
recalculate processing data and update positions of ads according to their current value.
As for bids and ad/website quality, their value varies depending on the kinds of 
ads you use, as well as the kind of website you have. Note that your actual bid is closely 
connected to your maximum cost-per-click bid, which is the maximum amount you 
could pay per one click. However, usually you’re charged less—everything depends on 
the quality of your ad that is calculated according to the expected number of potential 
clicks, ad relevance, and landing page availability. An ad auction determines the 
maximum cost-per-click bid, which is required to keep your ad at a given position.
How to Fit into Your Budget
One of the main drawbacks of AdWords lies in its competitiveness—that is, the constant 
competition among retailers for getting the best ad positions. The more money you offer, 
the more chances you get to appear among the first positions, and accordingly, get more 
clicks to your website. Thus, a steadily developing retailer has to be able to invest at least 
$2,000 to $5,000 a month in an ordinary AdWords campaign. Nonetheless, buying website 
traffic consists of more than clicks. The better retailer that you are, the more bids you’re 
required to offer. So before starting your cooperation with AdWords, take the following 
into account:
• 
How much money are you willing to spend on a single day of your 
advertising campaign? Days are more relevant than weeks or 
months because you cannot predict how long your ad will bring 
you enough profit.
• 
Will you vary your daily bid into parts by bidding in specific times 
of a day? This ad scheduling is very useful and cost-saving if you 
know when your website experiences its best-selling hours.
• 
Is your quality score high enough to be worth risking? If you’re not 
sure about the relevancy of your keywords and the quality of your ad 
and landing page, it’s better to invest into their improvement first.

Chapter 2 ■ Sales Generation
116
How to Structure Your Ad Campaign
Depending on the kind of ads you have, your approaches to an AdWords campaign 
will vary. Product ads usually tend to work out, provided they are divided into definite 
categories; for instance, furniture products are better structured when categorized into 
beds, chairs, tables, and so on. Furthermore, you can specify each category by introducing 
single-size beds and double-size beds. That will make your ads more specific for potential 
customers and will clarify which products are more popular than others.
How to Manage Your Resources
Working with AdWords requires certain time expenditures as well. The more developed 
retailer that you are, the more profound ad campaign planning you should do. To buy 
Internet traffic simply by putting some money into it is never enough. Using text ads is 
indeed easier, but it’s evident that for a range of products, you should work on its proper 
listing in AdWords webpages, manage regular updates of assortment and price, and 
automate submissions to Google Merchant Center. These hard tasks often require hiring 
corresponding specialists, but the results are definitely worth it.
How to Launch an AdWords Campaign
Next, I shed light on launching an ordinary AdWords campaign for your Magento website. 
Let’s start with some basic aspects, such as your AdWords account.
Create an Account in AdWords
Take the following steps to create an AdWords account.
	
1.	
First, visit AdWords’ main page and choose Try AdWords 
Now.
	
2.	
If you already have a Google account, then you can simply 
sign in with the existing login and password; otherwise, tick I 
do not use these services and enter your email address and a 
relatively strong password. Then solve a captcha and create an 
account.
	
3.	
Select your country, time zone, and the currency you’d like 
to deal with. Google’s billing will highly depend on this 
information. Remember that after submitting this data, you 
will not be able to change it.
	
4.	
Click Continue and verify your account through the link sent 
to your email address.

Choose Your Ad Campaign
Each campaign can be run on the same or various AdWords settings—it’s up to your 
tastes and the possibilities. There are three basic settings areas:
• 
Budget and bid amount
• 
Optional elements that can be adjusted to the main ad structure 
through ad extensions
• 
Specification of places where you want your ads to appear
Now, it’s time to look through settings:
• 
Campaign name. This name will only be visible to you, but it 
would be great if you specify it according to your actual business 
goals. It’s not recommended to use default Google names to find a 
particular campaign afterward.
• 
Type. Here you can specify what kind of ads you’re going to 
create. For novices in advertising it’s reasonable to select the 
“Search Network with Display Select” type of a campaign that 
allows you to gain access to the most popular ad placements. You 
can also choose a subtype of your campaign, which determines 
the range of settings you will use for making an ad. The Standard 
subtype is preferred when you’re a newbie.
• 
Networks. You can choose either Google Search Network or 
Google Display Network to manage the appearance of your ad 
on other websites. The first option implies that your ads will 
be shown on Google-related websites, including YouTube and 
AOL. The second option enables your ads to be shown on other 
websites that have a partnership with Google.
• 
Devices. You can work on this option later when you decide to 
optimize your ads for tablets and mobile devices.
• 
Locations and Languages. Here you can choose an appropriate 
language for your ads, as well as a location that will provide only 
targeted location users with the ability to see your ads.
• 
Bidding and budget. You can insert bids manually or delegate 
them with the help of this option. Remember that your default bid 
represents the maximum amount you’re ready to pay for your ads 
placement, while budget shows how much you really intend to 
spend for every day of your campaign.

Chapter 2 ■ Sales Generation

• 
Ad extensions. This category contains additional settings, 
including the placement of links to your website, your local store 
address, or phone number.
• 
Advanced Settings. Here you will find optional settings aimed 
at displaying your ads on your customers’ screens at the most 
appropriate time. This category features different schedules, such 
as your campaign program or the times that ads appear each day.
Create a New Campaign
Take the following steps to create a new campaign.
	
1.	
Click Create your first campaign.
	
2.	
You’ll be directed to the Select Campaign Settings page, 
where you can set up all the previously mentioned categories.
	
3.	
At the end, don’t forget to click Save and Continue. Later 
you’ll be able to edit most of the settings.
Ad Groups
After you’re done with settings, you will be automatically introduced to the “Create ad 
and keywords” page. It is possible to create an ad group here and use it as part of a more 
general ad campaign.
Each ad campaign includes one or multiple ad groups, depending on the type 
selected in Campaign Settings. Each group consists of an ad, a specialized keyword set, 
and bids for its placement. With certain keywords for every ad group, you enhance the 
relevance of your ads in a list of search results. Therefore, an ad group should correspond 
to a particular type of product you offer. After creating an ad group, you can proceed to 
managing the ads themselves.
Ads
There are different formats of ads available for your ad campaigns. Regardless of the 
format, it is required to create a separate range of keywords for each of them. The 
available ad formats vary from text and image ads to video and mobile ads.
Let’s have a look at the simplest text ad.

AdWords Conversion Pixel
AdWords provides its users with an opportunity to track their conversion rates based on 
customers’ interaction with your Magento website. This includes the number of ad clicks, 
product page views, app downloads, order check-outs, and so forth. Conversion tracking 
also features all the necessary tools for maximizing profit from your ad campaigns and 
reducing overall expenses. In addition, it sheds light on how good your ads are. The key 
element of AdWords conversion tracking is the conversion pixel tool, which is basically a 
1×1-pixel image placed on one or several website pages through a piece of code that you 
can copy and paste as a part of your primary ad campaign. This pixel effectively reacts on 
every activity on your website, including:
• 
Ad clicks from affiliate websites
• 
Checkout button clicks on a checkout confirmation page
• 
Clicks referral URL’s leading from your store, which allows you 
tracking visitors even when they leave your page
Despite the fact that Magento does not support out-of-the-box AdWords conversion 
tracking, there are a lot of third-party possibilities for effective integration. For instance, 
here you can find a handy module written in JavaScript. Its primary role is tracking 
conversions from a checkout/success page of Magento stores. Alternatively, you can 
make use of the extensions described next.
Google AdWords and Facebook Ads Conversion Tracking and 
Remarketing
This Magento extension provides double-sided integration with Google AdWords and 
Facebook advertising campaigns. As a result, you get a high-end experience of conversion 
tracking process. The module is easy to set up, and after launch, its conversion tracking 

Chapter 2 ■ Sales Generation
121
code is automatically stored on the Checkout Success page of your website. There is also 
a useful feature called Remarketing Integration, which enables ecommerce owners to 
capture data about what particular products your visitors are interested in. Thus, you will 
be able to follow your customers on other Internet resources with the aim to show them 
the most appropriate ads. Therefore, there will be more chances to see these customers 
on your store again. You can get the latest version of the extension for only $49.
Kulmage Google AdWords
This is another useful Magento extension for tracking your AdWords conversion rates. 
The extension’s code is placed on the Magento Success page without any additional 
adjustments. Later on, you can easily manage its performance through your admin panel. 
The module is free and easy to use.
LUKA Google AdWords Conversion Tracking
This is a free-of-charge module for AdWords conversion tracking integration. The great 
advantage of this extension is that you can place conversion tracking pixels on any page

note that this module is compatible with Magento 1.5+.

Alternatives to Google AdWords
Many retailers are accustomed to think that Google AdWords is the most effective  
pay-per-click management service for driving more traffic to websites. However, it may 
not be that efficient, or it may be even harmful to your business, especially if you’re a new 
entrepreneur. The problem is that you cannot realize the consequences until you invest in 
AdWords campaign. Thus, you are facing the following:
• 
Rivalry. Being especially popular among large and highly 
developed companies, the AdWords platform makes it impossible 
for small businesses to be competitive. You have to invest more 
and more just to be able to provide your ads with the best working 
keywords. With such cost-intensity, you’re likely to burn out at the 
very beginning of your campaign.
• 
Time-wasting. As an ecommerce newcomer, you won’t be really 
knowledgeable in all the specifics of AdWords, so you have to 
spend some time on getting acquainted with the toolkit. But such 
experiments are risky, because again, you spend your money on 
them and you don’t know any end results.
• 
Vague bidding system. AdWords has a very intricate system of 
money distribution. Although you can control the amount of bids 
you submit for you campaign, and even invest as little or as much 
as you want, you will spend much time trying to find out where 
your money eventually goes. Moreover, if you fail to be attentive 
and forget to set a proper management over your bids, you’re 
likely to lose everything.
This appears to be an uneven game where big corporations get the best advertising 
results and small businesses struggle uselessly for a more or less satisfying position in 
Google search results because they have a tighter budget.
In this situation, you have to think of other ad sources that could be more loyal and 
suitable for such a small business as yours.
ExactSeek
ExactSeek is a flexible advertising platform that allows retailers to attract many visitors 
to their online stores. It offers various programs from which you can choose the most 
appealing one.
• 
Traffic Program. This program requires a quarterly subscription 
update and seems to be very profitable due to the relatively low 
cost of advertising services. All ads provided by this program can 
bring you up to 3,000 visitors during every subscription period. 
ExactSeek’s exclusive traffic gaining program targets users 
specifically from the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, 
and Australia.

Chapter 2 ■ Sales Generation
123
• 
Featured Listings. The program includes the Traffic Program 
combined with simple sidebar ads implemented in search engine 
result lists and directories. The Featured Listings tool offers 
low-cost investments and prevents you from tracking your ad 
performance, making additional bids, and inventing too complex 
advertising schemes.
Facebook Paid Ads
Facebook has its own advertising platform that helps new entrepreneurs address certain 
demographics and audiences within a billion-member social community. The principal 
aim here is to create a separate Facebook profile that represents your website inside the 
social media environment. From there, you can try various advertising schemes to gain 
the maximum website viewing results. The main advantage of Facebook Paid Ads is its 
simplicity and high efficiency.
Clicksor
Clicksor is another alternative to AdWords that targets certain market segments. It has 
extremely cheap bidding offers; therefore, you can start investing at just 5 cents a month. 
Clicksor relies on time and contextual and geo targeting to achieve the best advertising 
results.
Yahoo! Bing
The Yahoo! Bing advertising platform is the second most popular service after Google 
AdWords, which has a lot more to offer. If you decide to cooperate with Bing, you can 
forget about investing in other platforms, since apart from being advertised in Yahoo! 
Search results, you get an opportunity to access the service’s ad partnership, which 
includes such giants as Amazon and Facebook. Bing is very popular in the United States, 
so you may already know what audience to target there. Moreover, bidding prices are 
significantly lower on Bing than AdWords.
Yahoo! Gemini Ads
This is an additional advertising tool in the Yahoo! search engine that helps you effectively 
encourage people to visit your website. Even if conversions remain low, you can be sure 
that your brand will become more popular than it is now. Gemini Ads works simply: you 
create an ad and then choose the most appropriate target audience. As always, add a 
couple of the most relevant keywords and bid for publishing your ad at specific resources.

Chapter 2 ■ Sales Generation
124
BuySellAds
BuySellAds is not as popular as the ones already described, however, it is none the less 
effective. It has recently reached the milestone of selling over 6 billion ads a month; 
consequently, there are no reasons to omit it. First, BuySellAds is aimed at small 
businesses. It provides convenient ad monitoring conditions, as well as simple and 
transparent reports that show how your investments are spent. With BuySellAds, you can 
easily monitor your current advertising performance and even pause regular investments 
in the event of an unexpected money shortage.
BlogAds
The BlogAds service offers more suitable advertising conditions for certain segment 
retailers. In fact, with the help of this platform, you can advertise your products using a 
blog format with various types of ads, ranging from banners to custom skins. BlogAds 
actively cooperates with large blog websites and social networks that contain easily 
identifiable target audiences. You should note that monthly prices on BlogAds vary 
depending on ad placement—the lowest price is about $150 a month.
StumbleUpon Ads
The main advantage of this service is that you can advertise literally everything you 
want and still get nice visit rates. However, numerous visits won’t necessarily bring you 
numerous customers, and StumbleUpon Ads is a place where you can become certain of 
this statement. Thus, the platform is more likely to be used for getting people acquainted 
with your brand rather than convert them into buyers.
Partner Promotion
Cooperation among individuals and companies can significantly influence your market 
presence. Thus, it is often enough to be mentioned in somebody’s blog to receive a 
huge feedback and increase the amount of your sales. That’s why you should always be 
sociable and head toward friendship with companies sharing your interest.
Social Media Advertising and SMM Campaigns
Social media is still widely used for advertising and sales boost, and it’s hard to deny its 
efficiency in terms of ecommerce retail promotion. With millions of people surfing social 
network websites, the traffic source is worth investing in. Since different platforms unite 
people with various tastes and interests, you have lots of opportunities to reach your 

Chapter 2 ■ Sales Generation
125
target audience. Unfortunately, social advertising is no longer free of charge. Sometimes, 
you even have to pay as much as you would spend on an AdWords campaign, but there 
are still lots of opportunities related to this kind of advertising. Start your SMM campaign 
with the following steps:
	
1.	
Clarify your campaign’s objectives: increased traffic, 
engagement, clicks, and so forth.
	
2.	
Choose the right type for your campaign. You can use ads 
(boosted organic ads for everyone; specific promoted ads 
aimed at certain user group), share some brilliant content, or 
combine both approaches.
	
3.	
Define your target audience. Luckily, social media provides 
tons of information about users. Use this data wisely to find 
your customers and create an approach to uninterested ones.
	
4.	
Plan your budget. Set a total monthly budget and calculate a 
daily budget.
	
5.	
Design your ads. Note that different social networks have 
different requirements for the content of ads, such as image 
size and resolution, or the number of characters.
	
6.	
Always be on. Note that a quick response can turn your visitor 
into a buyer.
	
7.	
Work with shopping in mind. Socializing is the main reason 
for people to spend their time on social networks. Therefore, 
you should spend your attention on making shopping better 
with the help of these services. Sometimes it is enough to add 
social sharing buttons and enable customer reviews in order 
to gain maximum profit from social networks. At least, these 
are the core requirements for every ecommerce store. At the 
same time, you can incorporate a social media experience 
into every aspect of your Magento website, so don’t hesitate 
to provide your customers with the ability to use their social 
network profiles everywhere from login to checkout.
	
8.	
Combine social media strategy with other marketing 
strategies. You can always enhance your email marketing 
template with the help of social sharing options. Moreover, 
think of utilizing your social media connections to multiply 
customer subscriptions to your mailing list. And don’t forget 
about Google+ and its influence on search results.

Chapter 2 ■ Sales Generation
126
	
9.	
Avoid being self-serving. Rely on an 80/20 ratio, where 20% is 
your promotional content and 80% is the content that engages 
your customers.
	
10.	
Use promoted posts. Usually, such posts don’t include 
any advertising information, drawing users’ attention by 
introducing some truly useful information like how-to guides, 
interesting facts, digests, photos, videos related to your 
activity, downloadable ebooks, and so forth.
	
11.	
Think of target ads. Using target ads helps you get to a specific 
social media audience, and as a result, increase website traffic.
	
12.	
Utilize specific social media for specific purposes. For 
example, business-to-business ecommerce advertising is 
more reasonable on LinkedIn. At the same time, women-
related products can attract Pinterest users. Thus, you should 
figure out the demographic majority of the social network that 
you’re going to use for online advertising.
	
13.	
Reward your social followers. Provide them with exclusive 
offers, bonuses, and discounts. Do you like feeling special? Of 
course you do. So why do you think your customers wouldn’t 
like being treated the same way?
	
14.	
Use a social media marketing strategy and visual content.
• 
Create eye-catching visual content.
• 
Include infographics and video content in your social media 
campaign.
• 
Run video ads with good CTAs.
	
15.	
Use SMM and SoLoMo (social-local-mobile technology).
• 
Rely on real-time engagement to get loyal and highly active 
customers.
• 
Utilize both offline and online marketing data to track 
individual and collaborative performance.
• 
Reach people with the help of a mobile version of your ads 
(especially Facebook ads).
• 
Use local awareness ads.
• 
Try to increase conversions and decrease CPA. Get the lowest 
possible cost per acquisition.
• 
Rely on advanced data insights and social media marketing 
analysis in combination with ROI-driven advertising.

Chapter 2 ■ Sales Generation
127
	
16.	
Use new platforms.
• 
Don’t limit your SMM campaign to only Facebook and Twitter.
• 
Explore your traffic in order to understand where your 
audience hangs out.
• 
Learn the preferences and tastes of your target audience.
• 
Don’t try to conquer all social networking services.
• 
Find new social ad channels.
• 
Allocate your budget wisely and reduce wasted ad 
expenditures.
• 
Try to avoid using outdated social media tactics.
• 
Experiment with new platforms and approaches.
In any case, you should analyze the results of your campaign. Thus, you will be able 
to make vital improvements and fixes, and as a result, enhance its future productivity. It 
is extremely important to take all of your mistakes into account, as well as utilize all past 
practices. Always try to find answers to the following questions:
• 
Did you get the expected results?
• 
What is the ROI of your campaign?
• 
How did a conversion rate change?
• 
What are your mistakes?
• 
How could you improve a future campaign?
Now let’s take a look at various social media ecosystems and proven ways of 
advertising within these ecosystems.
Facebook
Facebook is the most powerful source of online advertising in a social media sphere. 
Since this network is surfed by all possible users, you can easily reach people who might 
be interested in the products that you are selling.
Start with creating your official store page on Facebook. You can do it even more 
easily by linking your personal page to it, as follows:
	
1.	
Go to Options and select Create page.
	
2.	
Choose the most appropriate business category (i.e., local 
business, company, brand, entertainment, etc.).
	
3.	
Specify the chosen category to fit your industry type.
	
4.	
Agree with the Facebook Terms and Conditions and click 
Get Started.

Chapter 2 ■ Sales Generation
128
You then have to fill your new business page with content. The procedure is 
quite similar to personal page content management. You should necessarily include a 
description of your store, create a profile image (such as your company logo), and add 
this business page to your personal page’s Favorites (to get an immediate access to it).
Of course, there are several helpful features aimed at increasing the performance of 
your Magento website on Facebook. The following describes the most reliable ones.
• 
Custom Audiences is a handy tool that allows you to monitor 
those users who come to your website from Facebook. Moreover, 
you can even identify which pages they have seen. It is possible 
with the conversion tracking pixel. With the help of the data 
gathered by this pixel, you get better understanding of your 
customers and their preferences.
• 
Lookalike Audiences is another useful Facebook tool that 
gathers information about the existing customers and utilizes it 
for searching new users that might be interested in your products.
• 
Friend-to-friend Payments is an additional payment method for 
your store. All Facebook users can now link their debit or credit 
cards directly to their personal pages and purchase any products 
right there. As a retailer, you can adjust this feature to eliminate 
the necessity for your customers to visit your Magento website 
and struggle through a standard checkout procedure.
• 
Dynamic Product Ads is a library of cool ad templates that 
considerably simplifies the process of creating ads on Facebook.
• 
Multi-Product Ads allows you to display several products in a 
single ad. It increases your chances to grab the interest of your 
target audience.
If you still have questions regarding Facebook advertising management, I recommend 
you to look at these profound video-lesson devoted to effective online advertising.
The Best Facebook Modules for Magento
Facebook covers a vast variety of demographic groups that can help you build a good 
stock of loyal audience that always looks for new items on your digital shelves. Utilizing 
Facebook’s endless potential for attracting new customers will become even more 
effective when you connect your Magento store directly to the social network’s features 
and functions, and choosing specialized Facebook modules for Magento. Since there 
are lots of various extensions available for Magento, next you will find only those that are 
really worth using.

This extension offers a complete integration with Facebook as well as an opportunity 
to customize almost every feature. Developers from StoreYa provided their product

Facebook accounts for leaving comments under blog posts or products. Comment 
fields and an interface look as they do on the social network itself, creating a more 
habitual atmosphere and encouraging users to leave comments. Another useful feature 
is presented by an offer to share comments with users’ friends through personal pages.

click an attached link leading to your website page. This opens even more possibilities 
for driving additional traffic to your online store. The Facebook Comments module costs

extension displays a link to a product, its name, picture, and a short description. The 
module can be purchased for $59.
Twitter
Since this social media network ranks second after Facebook in number of users, it is 
necessary to utilize it for promoting your business as well. Although Twitter shares many 
features typical for other social networks, it also has a certain amount of unique stuff that 
makes it more appealing for online advertising. Let’s consider Twitter’s unique features:
• 
Promoted tweets are basic types of ads that require using small 
input space to attract customers in the most concise way. Thus, 
you can promote the most relevant products of your website, the 
upcoming items of your company, and marketing events that you 
take part in by putting them into a neatly structured tweet.
• 
The Promoted accounts feature lets your brand account appear 
among the leading positions on the Who to Follow list. This 
will primarily gain more audience to your store and evoke extra 
interest in your current inventory.
• 
Promoted hashtags are available to the most successful 
merchants due to high cost. They are placed in the Trends 
widget to make users notice and discuss them in their feeds. 
Moreover, users often click hashtags to find all related tweets and 
discussions.

Chapter 2 ■ Sales Generation
131
• 
Liking product-related tweets. It’s a pretty smart promotion 
scheme that attracts Twitter users’ attention to your brand. For 
instance, if your business concerns making furniture, you can use 
Twitter Search to look for users that have your keywords in their 
posts (like new bed, furniture store, nice wooden tables) and you 
can add their posts to Favorites.
• 
Twitter offers is an official Twitter feature that enables merchants 
to create card-linked promotions and share them with other 
Twitter inhabitants.
• 
Quick Promote Ads. To use this Twitter feature, you need an 
advertising account. According to it, your tweets will target those 
users that are interested in your current followers.
Twitter Modules for Magento
Of course, managing your Twitter profile apart from the website will not work unless you 
link it to your store page. Magento users can utilize one or several Twitter extensions 
(described next) for a successful integration with the Twitter environment that maximizes 
the amount of traffic coming from this popular social media.
Multi Twitter
This extension will display your latest tweets on the main page of your Magento website. 
Furthermore, you can display tweets of multiple Twitter users if they mention the 
name of your store in their posts: simply add necessary usernames to the extension’s 
configuration field. It is also worth mentioning that Multi Twitter is compatible with the 
latest versions of all major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and IE. Another useful 
feature allows choosing a desired amount of tweets for displaying on your website page. 
Note that customers often read not more than three to five tweets per visit, so there’s 
no need to display more than ten of them. After all, the main content on your store is 
products, not tweets. You can purchase the module for $39.

quite straightforward, it still can be customized either by size or text type. In addition, you

Instagram
Although Instagram is considered to be less adjusted for advertising, it still attempts to 
level up as a competitive social marketing platform. Merchants are now widely using 
Instagram for posting the photographs of their goods to attract attention of local users. 
There are more than 475 huge companies on Instagram. Such giants as Disney, Electronic 
Arts, The Gap, and Taco Bell implement their ad campaigns with the help of Instagram. 
This social networking service still lacks real advertising features, but there are already 
numerous methods created to boost your efficiency on Instagram:
• 
Carousel ads is a feature that has recently been launched within 
the network. It enables merchants to add multiple photographs 
into one post; images are simply swiped left, so there are no 
obstacles for you to grab users’ attention. Such brands as 
Samsung, Banana Republic, and L’Oréal Paris have efficiently 
used this feature for their campaigns.
• 
A specific amount of hashtag adoption. According to recent stats, 
ecommerce merchants prefer using more hashtags than any 
other businesses that work on Instagram. The lack of keywords 
and links is the main reason of such behavior. So don’t hesitate to 
utilize hashtags, but use them wisely.

Chapter 2 ■ Sales Generation

• 
Feedback to your followers is the most powerful action on 
Instagram because it helps you get more trust and loyalty. An 
individual approach is likely to bring positive results from your 
interactions within this social media service.

hardly achieve your goal without specialized Magento extensions developed for the best

uploaded to your Instagram account, it becomes visible on the website. The same action 
is possible after updating a gallery through the extension panel. All pictures in the gallery 
are instantly displayed in a slideshow manner, which prevents your visitors from the long 
and tiresome clicking on every image individually. The extension is very light and costs 
only $4.99.

it for $69.
Instagram Widget
With this extension, you get the ability to display Instagram profile pictures anywhere on 
your online store starting from the homepage and ending with checkout for only $10. The 
module covers the whole range of previously mentioned features. In addition, it offers 
the count of pictures that are shown on your website, unique customizations for various 
pages, and an easy-to-use enable-disable option.

Pinterest
Pinterest is a visual content social media network that consists mostly of US users. 
Another useful demographic fact is the ratio between female and male users: women 
account for about 80% of all Pinterest users. Moreover, most of these women are in their 
forties; consequently, you get a sufficiently reduced target audience. But you still have all 
chances to get new customers here, so don’t ignore this network.
So what should you do to drive more traffic to your Magento website?
• 
Create multiple company boards. Each board can be devoted to 
a specific type of your products. Additionally, try to utilize more 
creative, sensitive, and even touching images that are somehow 
related to your product.
• 
Provide short descriptions, direct links, and prices to your item 
images.
• 
Give preference to lighter, taller and no-face images. According to 
statistics, these tactics boosts the amount of repins to 23%.
• 
Place a pin button on your website to provide your customers 
with the ability to share your products with their followers.
• 
Use both rich pins and promoted pins features for your ad 
campaign. Although these features are not free, they are rather 
effective in Pinterest environment. Rich pins allow you to include 
additional information about your products including prices, 
sales, quantity, and brand. Promoted pins are designed to enlarge 
your audience.
• 
Utilize an effective hashtag since there is only one you’re allowed 
to have on Pinterest.

Best Magento Modules for Blogging
Despite the fact that blogging platforms significantly improve the performance of 
ecommerce projects, they still have one major disadvantage—blogs are detached from 
the primary online store, which makes it more difficult to interact with customers. That’s 
why ecommerce developers are concerned with integrating blogging features into retail 
websites. Magento platform also has a wide range of free blogging solutions that you can 
use along with your website.

Real-Time Social Experience with Periscope and 
Meerkat
Periscope and Meerkat are two new social services designed for real-time streaming. Both 
solutions can be utilized within any ecommerce business. Here, I describe their features, 
core differences, and ecommerce opportunities.

in-e-commerce.html.

Chapter 2 ■ Sales Generation

Both Periscope and Meerkat produce live streams, which is a core common feature. 
Another aspect is integration with Twitter; sharing is optional with Periscope links, 
whereas Meerkat tweets all content automatically. Thus, Periscope users can easily 
control their audience.
Another difference consists in the availability of recorded content after the end of 
your stream; Periscope keeps videos for 24 hours, whereas Meerkat doesn’t provide any 
storing capabilities, which leads to a broken user experience. In addition, Periscope 
provides tighter integration with Twitter; you get access to your followers from within  
the app.
Periscope is currently used by such giants as Pepsi’s Mountain Dew, Spotify, and 
DKNY. Starbucks and MasterCard are among Meerkat’s prominent users. When it 
comes to the number of users, Periscope also holds the leading position. But what about 
ecommerce opportunities?
Since videos have always helped merchants become transparent with customers, live 
streams play a prominent role in this process. You can easily inform your target audience 
about any latest offer or product by using social streaming services.
There is also an opportunity to show your business from inside, since you already 
have lots of customers interested in this information. Moreover, this will help you to get 
new ones. Note that a live stream is a great tool for establishing credibility among your 
target audience. You can even stream live demos of your products, which will make your 
ecommerce business even more attractive. Thus, by providing live lessons related to the 
products you sell, sharing some interesting facts, or offering any other engaging content, 
you will utilize the ecommerce opportunities of Periscope and Meerkat:
• 
Place your customers in the middle of flash sales. You can easily 
engage your customers with the help of Periscope or Meerkat by 
placing them at the center of a flash sale. You just need to start a 
live broadcast of your event and make customers communicate 
with you. This should look like a TV show. Your customers are not 
only situated on your ecommerce website—they’re live on the air 
with you.
• 
Introduce your ecommerce business with the help of a Q&A 
session. There are probably dozens of customers willing to ask 
questions about your business. Don’t send them to the FAQ 
section of your website, because there is a better decision. You 
can gain their confidence with the help of question-and-answer 
sessions. You just need a Periscope or a Meerkat live stream. 
Don’t be afraid to show yourself to your customers; by being 
relatable, you will push your ecommerce business to a new level.
• 
Build product awareness and grow your sales. Ask your 
customers to add their real-life examples while you broadcast 
product information. This will not only help with building 
product awareness, but also increase consumer confidence, and 
as a result, sales.

Chapter 2 ■ Sales Generation
139
• 
Provide the customer with a better user experience. You can 
utilize live streaming for your customer support needs. Thus, you 
will be able to provide help not only to a particular customer, but 
to your whole audience of buyers.
• 
Get real-time feedback. Ask buyers to leave real-time feedback 
about your goods and services. You can call them, or even them 
invite to broadcasting events. If someone famous is using your 
products, ask this person to take part in the streaming.
• 
Turn all of your offline events into online ones. With the help 
of both Periscope and Meerkat, you can easily turn all of your 
offline events into online real-time translations. Since you have 
customers who are not able to take part in your events, you will 
provide them with such opportunity.
The following tips will help you maximize the effectiveness of your Periscope or 
Meerkat campaigns:
• 
Think about personalization. Greet your viewer by nickname 
or name. Remain polite. Don’t be afraid to say a name every time 
you answer a question or address a user.
• 
Announce your live streams a few days before you go live. 
You should do this on all possible platforms, as well as on your 
website. You can also use eye-catching banners to attract more 
attention.
• 
Never omit questions. It’s always better to say that you don’t 
know the answer.
• 
Use only portrait mode. In landscape mode, Periscope still 
displays messages from your customers in portrait mode, making 
a stream inconvenient for viewers. That’s why you should use it in 
portrait mode only.
• 
Use hashtags. Both Meerkat and Periscope are tightly connected 
to Twitter. You should always remember this nuance when 
creating a title for a new broadcast. Use the following hashtags 
to increase your findability on this social network: #periscope; 
#werelive; #livestream; #livebroadcast.
Social Influencers for Promoting Your  
Products Online
One of the most up-to-date methods of gaining some traffic to your website is dealing 
with famous people on the Internet. They include media personalities, bloggers, vloggers, 
and even social media accounts run by different people all over the world. All of them are 

Chapter 2 ■ Sales Generation
140
perfect as marketing channels to boost sales on your website. This marketing technique 
might be particularly interesting for those who have recently launched their business, but 
now suffer from the shortage of traffic.
Get to Know Some Instagram Influencers
Instagram is now very popular among younger audiences. It may become crucially 
tempting to attract new customers from such a crowded place. Moreover, it was found 
that Instagram is the platform giving 25% more customers to those brands that integrate 
their products with the local influencers than any other social media networks.
So, if you intend to find influencers for promoting your online store on Instagram, 
start looking for primarily those accounts that specialize in activities that might be 
directly or indirectly connected with your goods or services. The common mistake in this 
case is to look for the most popular users with a high number of followers; but it’s more 
likely that you will tap into a community that has nothing to do with your website at all.
To make your search even more productive, use a handy website called WEBSTA 
that keeps all the popular Instagram hashtags and user information in its database. Users 
with an impressive amount of followers usually don’t limit themselves by having only an 
Instagram page. They probably have their own websites and blogs; meanwhile, Instagram 
plays the role of an additional promoting source. Once you have found several potential 
candidates, don’t forget to look at their bio or contact page—website links and email 
addresses are the main indicators that they don’t mind cooperating with ecommerce 
businesses.
Another way to target influencers on Instagram is through the official mobile app. 
You can basically browse “the popular page” (with thousands of the most popular 
photos) in search of those that somehow relate to your business. Through them you can 
reach the owners of those photos and contact them through email (if possible).
The final thing is to write to the chosen Instagram account holders to attract their 
attention to your website and its products. You basically have to write a letter, which must 
be as neutral and loyal as possible, telling the person that you’re a fan of his or her posts, 
and you’ve just launched your own website dedicated to the things you’re selling. Further, 
you should kindly ask the person to try a sample of one of your products and share it 
with his or her followers. At the end, you can attach one or two images of your product. 
Alternatively, you can just leave a link to your website page.
Look for Popular YouTube Vloggers, Bloggers, and Press
Like Instagram, YouTube is full of popular users. What is more important, they don’t 
mind promoting stuff that is not only a part of their target subject and also stuff that is 
not related to their subject at all. To reach out to the appropriate vloggers, you can use 
the native search engine of the website by typing keywords that describe your business 
interest. The same traffic-gaining strategy applies to bloggers, but can be realized through 
the Google main page. It’s worth noting that targeting bloggers with fewer followers is 
often more profitable than targeting those with thousands of them since a small audience 
is usually more loyal to its blogger and his content and advertisements.

Chapter 2 ■ Sales Generation
141
As for the press, you might pay more attention to local news sites rather than global 
ones. Here, however, you have a chance to promote your products only by writing about 
them in the most original way and presenting it as a good pitch: laconic and interesting 
to read. So if you want to grab the attention of the press, make your story concise and 
valuable.
Do Some Smart Advertising on Reddit
This platform is very useful in terms of its mechanics, which allows you to get involved 
with an appropriate user category through a corresponding thread called a subreddit. 
There are thousands of subreddits devoted to all possible subjects, so you’re likely to find 
what fits you the best. But the thread that must be of the utmost importance to you is 
always in the “/r/entrepreneur” subreddit. There you will find a lot of useful discussions 
concerning business and ways to improve. “/r/smallbusiness” is another option for new 
entrepreneurs.
If you managed to find a subreddit dedicated to your website content, you can 
post unobtrusive little sentences there containing a nice and catchy offer to purchase 
your products for satisfying user needs. However, if you exaggerate with this offer, you’ll 
probably be banned, which will bring you no actual profit. Therefore, read general and/or 
local Reddit rules first.
Convert Your Family and Friends into Customers 
Through Facebook
Making advertising posts on your Facebook page seems legit, and also important, free. 
Moreover, this way of attracting customers is one of the first free online advertising 
methods being adopted by thousands of businesses all over the world. It might not bring 
you much profit in the end, but you shouldn’t lose the opportunity of making a few 
customers out of the people you know. You can even give them a 50% discount. Allowing 
your friends and family to be special customers can make them become loyal buyers.
Extend Your Website to Twitter
It’s also a good idea to create a separate Twitter profile for your website, but it’s certainly 
not enough for getting more traffic to your website.
The initial strategy in this case is the same: use appropriate keywords and find 
people posting tweets about content related to your website.
The next step is to follow those people, as they might become interested in what 
you’re doing.
Take part in events related to your products, such as fairs or presentations; make sure 
that you post a tweet with cool photos.
Inform your followers about new stuff coming out—keep their interest warm.

Chapter 2 ■ Sales Generation
142
Mention Your Potential Influencers in a Profound  
Blog Post
This method might become one of the most effective ones, as it’s probably going to get 
through to target influencers’ hearts. The only thing you need to do is to write a blog post 
about their activities, combining all the information you have under a unified title and 
catchy introduction. When writing about their blogs, don’t forget to mention their names, 
because this is what will make your website better.
Amazon Product Advertising
There is nothing more reasonable than advertising on Amazon since it is the biggest and 
the most popular ecommerce platform that ever existed. It’s no surprise that the company 
works hard on allowing merchants to fulfill their marketing ambitions in the easiest way. 
However, if you want to turn your website into the primary destination for Amazon users, 
then Amazon Product Ads is what you really need to utilize.
In general, Amazon Product Ads is a program for external businesses selling their 
products outside the Amazon platform which plays the role of a product promoter that 
attracts more customers. How to start using it?
	
1.	
Create an Amazon Product Ads account here. If you already 
have an account, simply sign in on the same page.
	
2.	
Go to the Settings bar and select User Permissions. Here, you 
will get a long list of product, advertising, reports, and other 
settings that you have to either check or uncheck, depending 
on your preferences. Save the changed permissions.
Complete your account information. Go to Settings 
➤ Account Info. Set a daily budget by clicking the 
corresponding category on the Advertising bar. The daily 
budget setting page is rather straightforward, which means 
that you can set only one price for all of your ads on Amazon.
	
3.	
Then you’re able to upload a product list file by selecting Add 
Products via Upload. In the new window, click Download 
Template. You have to choose the most convenient template 
format here.
	
4.	
Amazon Product Ads requires using the following attributes: 
category, title, link, SKU (stock keeping unit), and price. Thus, 
you should be ready to edit your uploaded product feed 
according to the requirements.

Chapter 2 ■ Sales Generation
143
	
5.	
After you have uploaded your product feed, wait while it is 
processed. You should also check the status report for errors.
	
6.	
Later, when you decide to change the bidding amount or 
update your inventory, you will have to upload a new product 
feed to Amazon Product Ads. Seems tough, but if you find 
Amazon helpful, it’s the only way to get the maximum from 
the marketplace, since there are no alternate solutions.
Conclusion
Keep in mind that every SMM campaign is unique. Try to figure out all the particular 
proprieties of your ecommerce business in order to create the most effective social 
media strategy. You can rely on third-party social media companies, hire a social media 
marketer, or do everything with the help of existing specialists—it’s up to you, but the core 
principles of successful campaign will always be the same.

CHAPTER 3
Growth
This chapter is about ecommerce growth, covering such topics as business expansion. 
The chapter is also closely related to the previous one, but it shades light on more 
advanced topics, such as conversion rate optimization, trusted shops, cart abandonment, 
referral and affiliate marketing, promotions, discounts, customer support, A/B testing, 
advanced analytics, and extended admin, tax, invoices, shipping, and order management.
Conversion Rate Optimization
Conversion rate optimization (CRO) is a system of methods aimed at increasing the 
percentage of website visitors, who eventually become customers or take a desired action 
in your Magento store. It is also often called conversion optimization.
Since conversion rate optimization is about turning your visitors into buyers, it is 
a key factor of your business growth and success. Unfortunately, young entrepreneurs 
and ecommerce startups make one common mistake: they spend too many resources 
on CRO without gaining traffic. This leads to a failure when a Magento store is optimized 
for a high conversion rate, but the number of users is not enough for the sustainable 
development of a company. There is often the lack of investment required for other vital 
enhancements.
Therefore, you should start your conversion rate optimization with free tools, 
investing money into driving traffic to your Magento store first (this topic is covered in 
the previous chapter). Robust CRO solutions are relevant only when you have a constant 
daily flaw of visitors.

Chapter 3 ■ Growth

How to Increase Your eCommerce Conversion Rates
Increase the performance of your Magento website and implement proper search engine 
optimizations. These are two of the most important CRO steps you should start with. 
Higher performance makes your customers more loyal and decreases your bounce rate. 
Proper SEO not only generates more traffic, but also helps your potential buyers to find 
exactly what they are looking for. When your content does not match search queries, 
conversion optimizations and performance improvements are useless. You can read 
more about performance and SEO in the first chapter of this book.
Make your store as simple as possible; people don’t like irrelevant content or overly 
complicated websites; some features are often useless and you should remove them, but 
don’t get carried away with simplification.
Pay more attention to the most important content. Place it above the fold—the area 
on every website that is visible without scrolling. And don’t forget to proofread everything, 
because your website will lose credibility if there are spelling or grammatical errors.
Use CTA buttons. Combined with a great offer, they can work as important 
conversion rate optimizers for your Magento store. Pay attention to their placement, 
color, size, and text.
Use A/B testing. This will help you avoid ineffective enhancements and get better 
results from trusted CRO solutions.
Optimize landing pages for your audience. I’ve already mentioned the importance 
of this step in the previous chapter. Tailor the rest of your store to suit the customer’s 
needs. Take into account that the different technological competence of your potential 
buyers requires certain design improvements. Younger visitors like sleek, efficient, and 
straightforward websites, while older ones prefer easy-to-read text.
Listen to your customers and satisfy their propositions. By adding a rating system 
and a comment section to your store, you will turn your customers into participants of 
conversion rate optimization. Use their reviews, comments, and social network activities 
to turn new visitors into buyers. You can also use a “Thank you” page. And don’t forget 
that the design of your brand should be everywhere on your Magento website.
Think about top-notch customer support. You should implement a live chat and 
other helpdesk solutions, as well as ensure that all of your emails have correct text, 
attractive design, and are readable without downloading images. This step is explained 
later in this chapter.
Simplify the checkout process. Since it lies in the core of the entire shopping 
experience and is the main exit page of every ecommerce store, you can drastically 
improve the conversion rate of your website by using one page checkout. You can find out 
more about this improvement in the next section of this chapter.
Use a competitive pricing model. Online buyers always compare prices on different 
ecommerce stores. Thus, you can easily enhance your conversion rates by showing that 
your prices are the cheapest. You just need to display your competitor’s prices on your 
website.
Reward loyalty bonuses to all returning customers. Note that repeat sales (sales from 
returning customers) not only increase your conversion rate, but help you get viral word-
of-mouth publicity as well. Thus, by offering discounts and sending gift cards, you will not 
only improve the conversion rate of your store, but also gain more visitors.
Set expectations by displaying accurate shipping times and inventory status. This will 
help you avoid cancellations, which provide a negative impact on your conversion rate.

Enhance your Magento store with improved navigation. There are dozens of reliable 
solutions aimed at making the navigation of your store more user-friendly. Of course, 
such improvements will positively influence your transformation of visitors-into-buyers. I 
explain how to implement this enhancement shortly.
Invest in product photography. Due to the inability to see your products in real life, 
online buyers prefer ecommerce stores with high-quality visual content, because it is 
often the only way to check the quality of the desired goods. Keep in mind that the better 
things look, the more likely they are to be purchased.
Assure security across your store. There are enough bottlenecks in default Magento, 
so you should remove them as fast as possible. The security improvements are covered in 
the first chapter of this book.
Always use analytics reports in CRO. Keep in mind that you should utilize all your 
past experience in order to get a maximum effect for your conversion rate optimizations. 
Pay attention to various analytics reports and you will be able to optimize your conversion 
in the best possible way. Read this article for a detailed description of this process.
Always check real-world examples. You can find 13 ecommerce case studies here:

Magento Extensions for Conversion Rate Optimization
I’ve already described the best Magento extensions. All of them are aimed at increasing 
your CRO to some extent. Now, I’m going to draw your attention to specific modules 
developed for conversion rate optimization. Let’s start with one page checkout.
One Page Checkout
One page checkout is among the most important improvements for out-of-the-box 
Magento. Both Enterprise and Community Editions incorporate a complicated checkout 
procedure divided into several steps. Of course, such checkout implementation provides 
a negative impact on conversion rate, but you can fix this issue thanks to an appropriate 
“one step/page checkout” solution. With its help, customers will see all the fields required 
for placing an order in a single block. As a result, the new checkout process becomes 
easier and faster, improving the conversion rate of your store. The full list of improved 
checkouts is available here: The Best One Step / Page Checkout Extensions For Magento1.
The IWD Magento extension does the following: reduces the checkout process from 
six steps to one; provides your customers with the ability to save their contact information 
for future purchases; supports multiple languages; and integrates with PayPal and 
Braintree. Also, there is an enterprise version of One Step/Page Checkout by IWD. You 
can review both solutions here: https://goo.gl/72qrA8.

The most popular paid one step checkout extension on Magento Connect is One 
Step Checkout v4. It is fully responsive and compatible with smartphones and tablets, 
which is extremely important nowadays. Unlike the aforementioned module, it allows 
customers to enter a coupon code directly in the checkout page and offers lots of other 
useful features. The extension costs $245. You can find additional information here:

Improved Navigation
Navigation is another bottleneck of default Magento. Luckily, there are lots of third-party 
solutions designed for improvement of the issue. For instance, there is an opportunity to 
use filters. With the proper configurations, they enable users to narrow down a website’s 
selection of products to just a few items. Unfortunately, a lackluster filtering experience 
prevails among ecommerce websites. According to Smashing magazine, only 16% of 
online stores provide worthwhile options: 42% lack category-specific filters; 20% have 
problems with thematic filters; and 32% don’t provide compatibility filters.
The problem often lies in the way merchants promote filtering options. Since there 
are certain highly important filters beneficial for your users, you should display them 
separately from traditional ones. Otherwise, there is a risk of overlooking these options 
or incomprehension of their importance. Only 16% of ecommerce websites actively 
promote important filtering options. Thus, they improve their conversion rates by offering 
a better user experience. If you would also like to spend money on improved navigation, I 
recommend you check out the following free Magento extensions:
Sidebar Navigation Menu Professional adds vertical category navigation into 
the sidebar columns of your store. The extension offers powerful configurations and 
intelligent design, which looks good with custom themes. The module works with anchor 
and non-anchor categories, as well as flat and non-flat categories. You can download 
Sidebar Navigation Menu Professional here: http://goo.gl/stZIZP.
Another reliable solution is Multiple Select In Layered Navigation. This extension 
adds the ability to apply several values of the same filter criteria at the same time. 
For instance, your customers can simultaneously browse for black and yellow boots. 
Unfortunately, there are no admin configurations related to the module, but it works 
as expected. You can grab the Multiple Select In Layered Navigation extension from 
Magento Connect: http://goo.gl/XvXt9.
The Improved Magento layered navigation extension by caciobany is likewise worth 
paying attention to. It is based on Ajax navigation, uses history pushState/popState, offers 
price slider with a submit button, supports SEO-friendly URLs, as well as multiple filters 
for the same attribute. All of these features can be easily enabled/disabled from the back 
end. You can download this extension on GitHub: https://goo.gl/0EvKYL.
The best paid solution is Improved Layered Navigation by Amasty. It supports lots of 
features typical on different modules. SEO layered navigation, shop by brand, Ajax layered 
navigation, layered navigation filters, advanced categories, a layered navigation, and a 
price slider are key options available with Amasty’s extension. The module costs $139, but 
it absolutely pays off. You can find additional information here: http://goo.gl/OOPJwB.

Improved Catalog Search
Every ecommerce site needs a great searching tool. By installing the correct extension 
or using an ecommerce search engine, you provide your visitors the ability to easily find 
the content that they are looking for. Improved catalog search is a great addition to the 
enhanced navigation. Add a fast and friendly solution and turn your customers into 
buyers, as they will rapidly find desired goods, avoiding navigation and filters.
The best improved catalog search option is offered by Elasticsearch, which is one 
of the most popular search engines, used by the best ecommerce sites. Being based on 
Lucene, Elasticsearch offers multitenant search capabilities. It utilizes schema-free JSON 
documents and a RESTful web interface. As an ecommerce search engine, Elasticsearch 
provides real-time search. Moreover, the system is highly scalable, so you just need to 
add a few more nodes to provide cluster with the ability to take advantage of additional 
hardware as your business grows. And you will be surprised with the Elasticsearch 
performance, because it is one of the fastest tools for ecommerce site search. Last but 
not least, it is a price. Elasticsearch is open source, so you can download and use it for 
free. You have the ability to implement it on your Magento website with the help of the 
following extensions:
The Smile Magento Elasticsearch module is designed to integrate your Magento 
store with Elasticsearch for free. The extension offers such features as full-text search 
improvement, rich autocomplete, highly tunable scoring, and so forth. The module is free 
and you can download it from GitHub: https://goo.gl/Qi0qMk.
Extension for Elasticsearch by BubbleShop is the best paid option. It costs $99 and 
supports “Did you mean?” and autocomplete features, smart correction for misspelled 
text queries, product attribute search, ultra-fast indexation, and tons of other ecommerce 
opportunities. A full list of features is at https://goo.gl/dHdnSc.
If your server does not support Elasticsearch, you can improve the default Magento 
search option with the aid of the Catalog Search Refinement module. By installing this 
extension, you will provide your customers with more relevant search results. Note 
that you can download it for free from Magento Connect: http://goo.gl/ibGfrC. 
Additionally, I recommend that you to review the list of the best ecommerce search 
engines here: http://goo.gl/dkBhGu. A digest on the best extensions for improved 
catalog search is here: http://goo.gl/jbpPj2.
Social Login
According to ConversionXL, 86% of users are bothered by the necessity of creating new 
accounts on websites. Moreover, 92% of average visitors will likely leave your ecommerce 
store instead of resetting their login information. Fortunately, you can easily improve 
a broken user experience by using a social login feature. At least, 77% of users think 
so. Facebook, Google+, Twitter, and other accounts are widely used for logging into 
various ecommerce websites and platforms. You can see the examples of social login on 
BlaBlaCar, AirBNB, as well as on thousands of other popular websites. But why is this 
feature so popular?
First, social login reduces the headache of typing out personal information during 
registration. Furthermore, it minimizes the time required to register to a few seconds. The 
next major reason is control over data: most social login accounts allow users to review 

Chapter 3 ■ Growth
151
sites that have access to their information and delete those that they don’t need any 
longer. The third important aspect for using social login is the accuracy of information. 
Since users utilize their social networks for logging into a system, they have to use 
relevant data, but only if they’ve used it previously.
As you can see, social login improves user experience and fixes a long and boring 
login procedure, providing a positive impact on conversion. Nowadays, everyone has 
several accounts in various social networking services, so don’t hesitate to implement 
social login on your Magento store. I recommend that you use one of the following 
extensions.
The best free option is Inchoo Social Connect. With this module, you will add 
Google, Facebook, and Twitter buttons to your Magento website. As a result, your visitors 
will be able to login or register with the aid of their social media accounts. Note that the 
buttons are available not only for creating an account page, but also during checkout. You 
can download the extension on Inchoo: http://goo.gl/63iQrs; or on GitHub: https://
goo.gl/0pB1aY.

The best paid extension is Social Login by MageStore. The module supports up to 
18 networks with Facebook, Google, Yahoo!, Twitter, and LinkedIn among them. Having 
entered the system, your customers have the ability to change their passwords. Social 
Login by MageStore costs $99. You can download it here: http://goo.gl/pCvMQG.
Also pay attention to AheadWorks Social Login3.
How to Optimize Each Page of Your Magento Store
This section lists the steps required for the optimization of your conversion rate. All the 
improvements are divided into groups related to certain web pages.
Home Page
Since lots of visitors land on your home page, it should be informative and show the 
variety of products that they might be looking for. And don’t forget about CTA buttons 
that will encourage visitors to explore your store further. Use high-quality visual content 
and show top-selling, featured, and recommended products on your home page. You can 
see the best home page examples here: http://goo.gl/Q91io.
Landing Pages
Landing pages are often used for specific promotional campaigns, such as AdWords PPC. 
They provide a higher conversion rate than a home page. That’s why you should set a 
headline, banner image, intro text, and product selection there. Note that this content 
should be highly adapted according to the conditions of your promotional campaign. It 
is a good idea to add testimonials and badges to your landing pages, as this will reduce 
customer anxiety. The last but not the least improvement is CTA: your landing pages 
should incorporate “Add to cart” or “Begin shopping” call-to-action buttons.
Product Listings and Catalogs
These pages appear after your customer has selected a category or performed a product 
search. A listing page for a particular category needs a dedicated introduction and an 
overview of available products. Stock and availability are also a must, since you will help 
your customers avoid clicking each product to check its availability. For returning visitors, 
display offers based on their previous views and purchases.
Another important improvement for default product listings and catalogs are the 
sorting and filtering options described earlier. Pay attention to small details, such as the 
number of products that match certain criteria.
3https://firebearstudio.com/blog/aheadworks-social-login-for-magento-2-and-1.html.

Chapter 3 ■ Growth
153
Note that categories such as “Customer favorites” and “Best sellers” matter 
to customers and are often helpful for converting casual visitors. Another useful 
optimization is an infinite scroll or a “View all” link, since it simplifies navigation and 
improves the user experience.
A powerful search capability is a reliable CRO feature on your Magento website. 
It should provide such options as suggestive search or promoted goods. I covered this 
earlier.
Individual Product Pages
For individual product pages, make the “Buy” buttons stand out from other content. At 
the same time, wish lists and “Save for later” buttons should be not as prominent. Using 
collaborative filtering on product pages is a good idea too. If you don’t know how this 
option looks like, this is an example: “Other customers that bought A also bought B” is the 
most popular implementation of collaborative filtering.
Now it’s time to talk about content. Take into account that long rambling 
descriptions are unlikely to be read. Thus, you should keep product description texts 
concise. With lengthy posts, use a “View more” link. Keep in mind that your descriptions 
should answer seller’s potential questions. If there are a lot of product details, it is better 
to tabulate them.
To increase your conversion rate by making your ecommerce experience more 
similar to real-world shopping, pay extra attention to images of product pages. Your 
photographs should show a variety of angles, as well as lifestyle shots, and support a 
product zoom feature. Additionally, you can include videos, as there is a tendency that 
interesting and creative videos are often shared. Thus, you will get a chance to turn your 
visitors into promoters of your brand.
Reviews from past customers are a proven way of conversion rate optimization. 
Positive feedback from other buyers persuades new visitors that your Magento store is a 
reliable place for online purchases. If you are a reseller, you can even use reviews from 
other sources.
Clearly inform your customers about your stock levels and returns policy. The same 
goes for trust seals, supplier logos, payment methods, estimated delivery times, and 
prices.
Use sharing buttons in addition to social login to improve conversion and promote 
your store on various social networks. It is necessary to provide product titles and 
descriptions with relevant keywords as well.
Shopping Cart
Don’t upset your customers by showing hidden fees only at checkout, since it is 
the number-one reason for cart abandonment. You should provide them with this 
information through a shopping cart. It is also a place for displaying stock levels, 
specification details, user-selected options, estimated delivery time, suggested products, 
and so forth.

Chapter 3 ■ Growth
154
Provide a convenient way for removing products and updating their quantities right 
in a cart. Additionally, it is important to take care of a coupon code field. Your customers 
like discounts, which is a good opportunity to improve conversion. The same goes for 
various shipping options, such as free or same-day shipping.
The Checkout
One step checkout is the main requirement for CRO on this page. Keep it free from 
unnecessary items and navigation, reduce everything to a single page, offer social login, 
and provide access to real-time support. Depending on your products and audience, you 
can add a gift wrapping option to checkout.
Don’t forget to implement several payment options, since different customers have 
different preferences. Note that by offering free return shipping, you will easily convert 
doubters.
Trusted Shops
A trusted shops badge will never improve any of your existing Magento store features, 
but it can easily increase a conversion rate by providing your customers with confidence 
that they will receive a top-notch user experience while shopping on your ecommerce 
website. Both Google Trusted Stores and Trusted Shops for Europe offer seller ratings 
and customer reviews. Moreover, the integration of your website with these platforms is 
extremely easy, so there are no reasons to avoid a badge. Read the full Google Trusted 
Stores and Trusted Shops for Magento4 article.
Install Google Trusted Stores for Magento. You can read its review here: Wyomind 
Google Trusted Stores5. Create a Google Trusted Stores profile, submit your shipment and 
cancellation feeds, and put the Google Trusted Stores badge on your Magento store. Now 
your customers will be informed that your website is a good place for shopping.
Integration with Trusted Shops is a little more complicated. You can go to the 
Trusted Shops with Trustbadge Magento extension here: http://goo.gl/3D97kR. 
After downloading and installing it, go to your Magento back-end system, choose 
Configuration, and open Trusted Shops. Enter your Trusted Shops ID (you can get it here: 
http://goo.gl/Q2Z5Ci). Follow the link to Trusted Shops, where you can generate your 
personal integration code. Copy the code and paste it into the appropriate field in your 
Magento back end. Save changes and you’re ready!
Now you know how to persuade your visitors that your Magento store is trustworthy.

Cart Abandonment
Abandonment of virtual shopping carts happens quite commonly. The abandonment 
rate for ecommerce retailers varies between 60% and 80%, and an average index is 
67.91%. To find the shopping cart abandonment rate, you have to compare the number of 
abandoned shopping carts to their total number. For example, there were 50,000 attempts 
to buy something from your Magento store during a particular month, but only 10,000 
transactions had been made. Thus, 40,000 carts had been abandoned. The abandonment 
rate is (40,000 ÷ 50,000) × 100% = 80%. Why is it so high?
First, it’s because of shopping carts alternate usage. Customers utilize them as a tool 
for determining the total price or looking for hidden costs. And, shopping carts can play 
the role of wish lists. At the same time, there are many reasons for leaving shopping carts:
• 
Unexpected costs
• 
Better price elsewhere
• 
Too expensive overall price
• 
Too complicated website navigation or too long checkout process
• 
Website crashes
• 
Expensive payment security checks
• 
Concerns about payment security
• 
Unsuitable delivery options
• 
Price in foreign currencies
Some visitors of ecommerce websites are just killing time, so don’t expect that they 
are going to buy something, but you can always try to incentivize the purchase. Improve 
the situation by using wish lists. Clear information about prices and additional costs also 
decrease abandonment rate. Shopping cart abandonment reminder emails are useful 
too—at least 50% of all consumers think so. You can even make a shopping cart more 
flexible to reduce your current abandonment rate. Don’t forget about Magento extensions 
designed to solve this problem. You can see a full list on the Firebear blog: Magento 
Shopping Cart Abandonment Extensions6.
I recommend that you take a look at Abandoned Cart Alerts Pro by Aitoc. This 
module informs your visitors about their abandoned carts and failed orders. It sends 
emails with discounts encouraging your potential customers to buy in your store. The 
extension can send up to three follow-ups. Moreover, it offers the ability to restore a cart 
within one click. Abandoned Cart Alerts Pro costs $99. You can get it here: http://goo.
gl/rhdow7.
If you are interested in a more robust cart abandonment solution, take a look at 
these cloud services: Granify, Barilliance, and WebEngage. All of them offer appropriate 
features aimed at reducing abandonment rates.

Granify (http://goo.gl/sWM2he) analyzes a shopper’s behavior. By monitoring over 
400 attributes per second, the system predicts further steps. If a potential buyer is going 
to leave your ecommerce store and abandon his cart, Granify tries to prevent this while 
he is still on your site. Barilliance (http://goo.gl/Ixh8lz) relies on emails, informing 
customers about abandoned carts, and WebEngage (http://goo.gl/Mox7lg) utilizes 
personalized offers.
I must also mention MageMail, an amazing cart abandonment tool by members 
of Real Magento Community. With this application, you will easily get your customers 
back to your website. In addition to cart abandonment features, the tool also offers a 
great opportunity to recommend various products to your customers based on their past 
purchases. Other important features include wish list reminders, A/B testing, birthday 
emails, review requests, one-click discounts, and so forth. For further information, visit

Referral and Affiliate Marketing, and Promotions 
and Discounts
Both referral and affiliate marketing, as well as promotions and discounts, are inevitable 
in your ecommerce essence if you are going to spread influence on new customers and 
markets. Next, I’ll show you the best Magento solutions related to these marketing areas.
Referral and Affiliate Marketing
Adding new customers to your Magento webstore by running referral and affiliate 
marketing campaigns is extremely easy. Long gone are the days when referral and 
affiliate marketing was the advantage of big businesses. Nowadays, there are tons of 
reliable solutions available for companies of all types and sizes. But what is the difference 
between referral and affiliate relations?
Affiliate marketing relationships are always financially driven while ones in referral 
marketing are personal. By choosing affiliate marketing, you motivate your customers to 
promote your ecommerce store for a financial reward. As a result, they often work with 
people they don’t know. As for referral marketing, it is based on altruism underpinned by 
a discount or some other incentives. Thus, customers recommend you to someone they 
know quite well.
As you can see, by implementing both referral and affiliate marketing campaigns, 
you can get new visitors and potential buyers to boost your sales. As mentioned, you can 
do it with appropriate Magento extensions. The best solutions are described in this article 
on the Firebear blog: The Best Referral and Affiliate Marketing Magento Extensions7.

Other honorable mentions include J2T Reward Points + Referral program (http://
goo.gl/AeGSQ7) and Refer a Friend by aheadWorks (http://goo.gl/BIsNm). The first 
module costs $49.99 and the second module is $99.
You should check out Affiliate by aheadWorks (http://goo.gl/jN44Mr). Using this

gl/bh6zWo). It offers all the features required for building a strong and reliable affiliate 
network.

and social networks. The module supports different affiliate programs aimed to promote 
specific products, categories, or brands. You can purchase the extension for $197.

Promotions and Discounts
Get your customers involved in the marketing process by adding an advanced discount 
system to your Magento store. Create different rules and motivate your visitors to perform 
certain actions by installing the appropriate modules. Extended discounts and promotion 
rules extensions will easily enhance your existing marketing capabilities. To find the 
best tools and toolsets, I recommend that you check out the blog post The Best Magento 
Extensions for Extended Discounts and Promotion Rules8. Or, you can read about the 
following modules instead.
Special Promotions Pro Magento Extension allows you to use customers’ account 
information to get a better insight into your customers’ wishes. By installing the module 
on your store, you’ll be able to create special offers based on order history, and rules 
based on both customer attributes and order subselection. The extension allows you to 
sell the most expensive products by giving discounts to additional cross-sell products, 
and excludes specially priced products in your discount programs. You can examine 
Special Promotions Pro by Amasty here: Amasty Special Promotions9. There is also a light 
version of this module: https://goo.gl/ZSX3Cz.
Another essential tool is Auto Add Promo Items (https://goo.gl/Dlj7mp). With its 
aid, you can automatically add free promo products to a cart. Little surprise gifts will make 
your customers loyal, so they won’t hesitate about returning to your Magento website.
Customer Support
Providing top-notch customer services is an important step in your ecommerce business 
growth. It can be used in different situations: as a marketing strategy, a way to raise your 
brand awareness, or a customer retention technique. Keep in mind that you should not 
only offer a reliable support, but charm your customers as well.
Provide services timely and in a professional manner in order to increase the success 
of your ecommerce business. Please note that it is just as crucial as defining your brand, 
and the best customer support solution is multichannel one. It is a strategic way to 
manage customer related questions within all possible platforms: email, phone, social 
media, and even your own website with live chats and helpdesk services. Not all of these 
are necessary for a small online store, but when growing a company, it is important to 
know what options are available.

By using all possible customer support channels, you will be able to deliver a first-
rate experience to all your customers and impress them in hopes that they will return and 
become repeat buyers, or at least share their experience with others. Here are five tips 
that could work to your advantage:
• 
Provide your customers with email support, as it is the easiest and 
the most common way to communicate.
• 
Don’t ignore social media as a reliable support tool.
• 
Integrate a live chat within your ecommerce store; it is one of the 
fastest ways to get information.
• 
Use helpdesk services to offer rapid customer support.
• 
Don’t forget about inbound phone support; it is also appreciated 
by your customers.
Take into account that there are customers requiring support even before purchasing 
something on your Magento website. Often, they simply go to another store to find 
the desired information or find other sources of help, rather than wait for your email. 
Customer services therefore should be visible and timely. If you are interested in how to 
treat customers, read this article: https://goo.gl/Uh15WY. Next, I shed light on live chat 
and helpdesk services.
Live Chat
You will probably lose potential customers if they don’t receive answers to their questions 
in real time. But you can change this situation dramatically by adding live chat support. 
With an online chat system, your customers get immediate help. Keep in mind that this 
solution reduces waiting time, which is often much less than that for phone support. At 
the same time, a live chat is a more cost-effective solution than call support, as it leads to 
lowering average interaction costs and reduces the need to hire more employees.
By installing live chat on your Magento store, you will increase conversion rates, reduce 
costs, and get more loyal customers. But what solution should you choose? In the The Best 
Live Chat Magento Extensions10 blog post, you find the following extensions: Official Zopim 
Live Chat (http://goo.gl/Oln73H), LiveChat live chat software (http://goo.gl/bz7BKy), 
Olark Live Chat (http://goo.gl/9tL7Gl), LiveAgent – Live chat & Helpdesk (http://goo.

Helpdesk Services
Helpdesk services and tools are used for offering support related to products and services. 
They are usually aimed at all possible kinds of troubleshooting, but it is not mandatory, 
since helpdesk software can be utilized for providing customers with information about 
their future purchases, for instance. As you might have guessed, this type of services 
provides a significant impact on overall customer experience; therefore, it is hard to 
imagine a successful ecommerce company lacking such solutions. Nowadays, there are 
tons of different helpdesk companies that provide unique customer support. Some of 
them focus on cards, live chats, emails, or phone calls, while others offer several channels 
of support. Kayako (http://goo.gl/zDeln), Kana (http://goo.gl/Dnu9G), Zendesk 
(https://goo.gl/zNYueN), and other reliable companies are described in this post on 
our blog: Top Helpdesk Services and Tools11. I recommend that you collect customer 
feedback and use it for future improvements. You can even rely on A/B testing to find out 
what solutions are the most suitable for your ecommerce store.
A/B Testing
A/B testing is a randomized experiment with A and B variants, which are the control and 
the treatment in the testing. Variant A (the control) is the currently used version, while 
Variant B (the treatment) is a modified one. The goal of A/B testing is to identify changes 
in your Magento store that lead to better results. Note that you can use this technique to 
test almost everything on your website, but there are five important things to start with.
The first one is a product title, as it is the most important content part of every 
selling page. The second vital thing you should test is the area of product images. Product 
descriptions are also in this list since they should make your customers click the “Add to 
Cart” button, which is also a candidate for testing, as well as other call-to-action buttons. 
The fifth place goes to stock availability notes.
When you know what to test, it is time to talk about the best A/B testing solution. 
According to my experience, the most robust and reliable set of tools is offered by 
Optimizely (https://goo.gl/RvCPm). Having implemented this solution, you will be able 
to A/B test all vital elements of your Magento store. The company provides a wide range 
of services and offers different pricing plans, so you can start using Optimizely without 
any unnecessary expenditures. A/B Testing for Magento is fully described here12.
Extended Admin Management
Unfortunately, Magento admin is not a subject of A/B testing, but you can always 
enhance it by installing appropriate extensions. By optimizing this part of your 
ecommerce store, you will reduce tons of routine processes. Therefore, you will be able to 
cut some costs (if you have administrators) and concentrate on more important aspects 
of your business development.

Magento Tax Management
Tax management is among the trickiest aspects of the Magento setup. You can use the 
official guide for implementing basic settings, but for more advanced improvements, 
extensions are required. You can see a full list of the best modules aimed at improved tax 
management here: Best Magento Extensions for Improved Tax Management14.
For example, you have the ability to outsource your sales tax management to 
experts with AvaTax integration. The Sales Tax Extension for Avalara’s AvaTax module 
not only calculates sales tax, but also manages exemption certificates and file returns. 
It is also able to remit payments between different tax regions. AvaTax is based on more 
than 100,000 taxability rules in over 11,000 taxing jurisdictions, applying them to all 
transactions within your Magento store. You can download the module for free from 
Magento Connect: http://goo.gl/KZMHYQ.
Exactor Sales and Use Tax Module is also worth mentioning. It provides the ability 
to calculate sales tax by a zip code or the street address where an order will be sent. 
Furthermore, the extension supports both domestic and international addresses. There 
is even a support of reduced or exempt tax rates, as well as an automated option that 
checks if goods are taxed appropriately. In addition, Exactor Sales Module supports tax-
exempt entities, so your Magento store will be optimized to satisfy the needs of resellers, 
hospitals, schools, governments, and so forth. Another important feature of this extension 
is its integration with a shopping cart: all sales tax rates are displayed there. You can 
get all of these features for free here: http://goo.gl/FhYPTi. And don’t forget to check 
other modules from the aforementioned blog post.
Extended Invoice Management
Although it is extremely easy to create invoices in Magento, the platform’s default 
opportunities are a little limited. Luckily, there is a huge community of both professionals 
and enthusiasts always trying to improve the out-of-the-box Magento experience. Their 
work results in thousands of modules developed for all possible purposes, including 
extended invoice management.
PDF Invoice for Magento allows you to customize invoice templates with additional 
fields. With this module, you can print your documentation with ease. It includes a lot 
of useful features, which turns invoice creation into a flawless process, and offers free

PDF Invoice Pro is a tool for PDF customization that allows you to change the look 
of PDF invoices by using HTML/CSS. The extension supports multiple PDF layouts and 
languages, as well as QR codes and barcodes. It works with orders, shipment, invoices, 
and credit memo PDF templates. You can purchase PDF Invoice Pro for $99. Get the 
module here: http://goo.gl/LRGQ2a.
Another popular solution developed for extended invoice management is the 
AdvancedInvoiceLayout extension. By offering highly optimized, configurable PDF 
layouts for invoices, credit memos, and shipments, it allows you to make your customer 
correspondence nicer and cleaner. The pre-configured layout offered by the module 
requires only your address and logo. AdvancedInvoiceLayout costs $53.55. Visit the 
Magento Connect web page for additional information: http://goo.gl/SAJG0n.

Advanced Shipping Management
Shipping management is another crucial facet of growth. When you’ve decided the 
carrier that you plan to work with, it’s time to install an appropriate extension. Note that 
all major shipping providers, such as DHL, UPS, and USPS, offer official tools for Magento 
integration. In addition, you can look for third-party solutions on Magento Connect.
Magento Community Edition User Guide (http://goo.gl/soQt5i) is also useful for 
configuring settings related to shipping. After installing an extension, you should perform 
additional tune-ups, as described in the official documentation.
You can always enhance the default shipping options with special Magento modules. 
By installing the WebShopApps MatrixRate extension, for instance, you will provide your 
customers with multiple shipping options based on their locations. The extension offers 
different shipping rates according to such parameters as zip code, country, shipping 
method, price, weight, and quantity. There are both free and premium editions of the 
MatrixRate extension. You can see the free edition here: http://goo.gl/NhQUQv.

As for shipping labels, Community Edition has a high level of integration with 
major shipping carriers, so you can easily set up and create shipping labels within your 
store. Just check the user guide: http://goo.gl/8BLnH1. This guide is also helpful: Top

Order Management
As a routine process, order management consumes a lot of time, but you can easily 
improve the default workflow with the aid of proper Magento modules. Since there are 
more than ten pages of order management tools on Magento Connect (http://goo.gl/
UzSeZ2), I recommend that you get acquainted with Order Manager by Fooman.
This is the only order management extension officially verified by Magento. It is aimed 
at managing your orders in bulk with just one click. Since such an approach saves hours of 
time, you can focus on more important things than processing every order manually.

Google Analytics and default Magento reports are not enough for a rapidly growing 
ecommerce business. When you need information about your sales, products, customers, 
or any other vital metrics, you should try extended analytics solutions, such as Advanced 
Reports by aheadWorks.
With this extension, you get a new source of information related to your store. This 
Magento plugin offers 22 different business reports that provide a clear picture of your 
ecommerce development. The dashboard of this extension shows all key sales metrics 
within a user-friendly interface. At the same time, all the reports can be sent by email. 
Since Advanced Reports by aheadWorks provides such features as profit calculation, 
abandoned cart monitoring, and “stock vs. sold” comparison, it can offer much more 
than default solutions do. The module costs $149. You can review it here: AheadWorks

How to Keep Your Magento Website Clean and 
Healthy
In addition to installing extensions and optimizing settings, it is extremely important to 
keep your ecommerce store in good shape. Therefore, I recommend that you follow the 
advice described here:
• 
Always upgrade both Magento and installed extensions to a 
recent version. That way you will be able to fix all bugs and 
remove bottlenecks related to older software.
• 
Check community updates. Open source and open minds offer 
you access to the latest features and vital improvements. The 
community around Magento is strong, so you can always rely on it.
• 
Clean up Magento logs and temp files. Read this article on 
Nexcess: https://goo.gl/oq6Wml. It describes an entire clean-up 
procedure in detail.
• 
Track your server/hosting free space, as this will save you from 
unexpected trouble.
Migration to Magento 2
Although official support for Magento 1.x will remain over the next few years, you should 
already think about the migration to Magento 218, since the platform already offers a lot 
of new ecommerce features, better performance, scalability, and SEO. Later, I cover some 
important nuances of Magento 2 and provide information on migration to Magento 2.
Magento 2 introduces some vital improvements to scalability, performance, and 
security. These three areas caused a lot of trouble and inconvenience among users of the 
previous platform version; therefore, you see a lot of extensions and services aimed at 
solving various performance and security problems.
How much has the situation changed after the release of Magento 2? A lot, but it 
doesn’t mean that there is no room for improvement. There are already some robust 
Magento 2 modules designed to enhance the existing capabilities of the platform, but even 
without installing them, Magento 2 shows better ecommerce results than Magento 1.
Since Magento 2 relies on a modern technology stack and a revamped code base, it 
offers such advantages as easier and (at the same time) unlimited customization, faster 
time to market, and higher deployment flexibility when it comes to cloud environments.
Magento 2 introduces an absolutely new approach to adding product lines, exploring 
new channels, and integrating additional ecommerce capabilities. When compared to 
1.x, your daily routine is now much simpler and faster. In addition, you get rapid testing, 
advanced omnichannel features, and world-class business metrics management. Next, I 
explain these benefits in detail.

extensions-tutorials.html.

Architecture and Technology Stack
Since Magento 2 offers both a more modular code base and rebuild service contracts, 
you get a platform with an environment that is more open to new ecommerce ideas and 
to customizing default features. With extensive APIs and automated testing, Magento 2 
introduces faster and higher-quality integration, and deployment with other ecommerce 
solutions and tools. Furthermore, a plethora of additional technologies that were 
unavailable in Magento 1.x are used to improve the performance of Magento 2. Deep 
integration with various third-party solutions also brings a lot of benefits.
With the aid of modern tooling and approaches, Magento 2 provides developers a 
better working environment that shows an absolutely new level of flexibility and ensures 
compatibility among its components. Thus, the new architecture and the revamped 
technology stack lead to a decrease in server response time and an increase in the 
rendering speed on the browser side. Just look at the following image by Session Digital, 
which illustrates the throughput measurements of Magento 2 compared to Magento 1.
Although this Magento 2 vs. Magento 1 picture illustrates the great difference 
between two versions of the platform, it is only the beginning of our comparisons.
Performance and Scalability
Being clumsy and resource-hungry, Magento 1 works at full power only with large 
enterprises, which is a sufficient drawback; but with the new release, the situation has 
changed dramatically. Magento 2 not only offers higher performance capabilities, it also 
offers them to the smallest merchants. Visitors can forget about delays when accessing a 
Magento 2 website. Furthermore, large order volumes and Enterprise-level site traffic are 
easily handled by 2.0, as illustrated in Figure 3-7.

Chapter 3 ■ Growth
169
As for scalability, Magento 2 no longer relies on a monolithic structure using a 
number of independent components. Figure 3-8 is an image by Session Digital that 
illustrates the scalability opportunities introduced in Magento 2.

As a result, you get a completely revamped shopping experience.
New Shopping Experiences
Magento 2 offers fast and easy checkout, better responsive design options, enhanced 
personalization, and simpler product discovery.
The two-step checkout process is lightning fast in Magento 2. It not only reduces the 
number of overall steps, but also minimizes the amount of required information. Every 
customer can now create an account with just one click and without any need to interrupt 
the transaction.
As for personalization, Magento 2 relies on data-influenced content in promotions, 
product recommendations, and other processes, making the available ecommerce 
experience much more user-oriented than it is in 1.x.
Easier shopping in Magento 2 is also possible due to better search capabilities and 
layered navigation. Customers can find exactly what they are looking for without any 
headaches.

Productivity Features
Productivity features introduced in Magento 2 include a new more user-friendly admin 
panel, guided product onboarding, which is also quite convenient. Faster import/
export (you can make it even better with our The Improved Import / Export Magento 2 
Extension19) and customized views are also among the benefits introduced in Magento 
2. As a merchant, you can manage various data types more efficiently, selling the right 
goods to the right customers at the right time.
Customization
Major layout manipulations are now available to everyone. While Magento 1 requires 
technical knowledge for the implementation of layout changes, Magento 2 relies on the 
Visual Design Editor with a drag-and-drop interface. Consequently, every merchant can 
easily modify blocks and containers within a website.
File Structure
As a developer, you can feel the benefits of Magento 2 with a new file structure. Major 
working files are now reorganized and moved under the “app” file. The only exception 
is the config.xml file. All of your templates, layouts, and CSS/JS files are situated under 
the “View” file of each module. And that is true for both the front end and the back end. 
Magento 2 offers a single code pool for both custom and core modules.
Migration
After the launch of Magento 2, it is vital to understand how to migrate from Magento 1 
to Magento 2. Since the migration is a complex process with lots of aspects, you should 
know what to do with themes, extensions, data, and custom features. In this chapter, I’ve 
gathered all information about Magento 2 migration. Next, you will find useful migration 
tips as well as reliable Magento 2 migration tools.
Requirements
Migration elapse time is among key requirements. Although critical for big projects, it is 
less important for small sites. For a big website, migration could take from several hours 
to a few days. Keep in mind that it shouldn’t be necessary to take the site offline for too 
long. The problem is in performing a full bulk copy of the database, which lasts a long 
time. A variation of the catch-up phase is also required. This phase occurs after the main 
bulk copy and requires an offline phase.
19https://firebearstudio.com/blog/the-improved-import-export-magento-2-extension-
by-firebear.html.

Chapter 3 ■ Growth
172
It is important to place restrictions on operations that should not be performed 
during the migration. For instance, it is possible to place orders, but all the changes 
done by administrators are prohibited. It is also expected that developers are going to 
provide migration support for their extensions. There are two possible approaches to data 
migration for extensions. First, developers can provide the necessary documentation with 
the detailed tutorials about migration. There is also the possibility of a more flexible and 
pluggable framework that can automate the migration.
Current Conditions
Exporting database contents and importing into Magento 2 are both too slow. The current 
design relies on a direct database-to-database data transfer.
A configuration file specifies which content should be copied from the Magento 1 
database to the Magento 2 database. The official support went only to the recent Magento 
1 releases. Earlier versions require the appropriate adjustment of the configuration file.
In addition to simple table copies, PHP code can be plugged into the process. It is 
required to perform more complicated data migration.
To capture changes to selected tables during the bulk copy, database triggers are 
used. All of these changes are saved in a table for the later use. To reduce the number of 
triggers, you should limit the administrator actions.
The migration tool also works with product images. Sites that do not rely on the 
default image storage may require some additional actions.
The Migration Procedure
The following are the steps in the database migration procedure.
	
1.	
Create database triggers, which are necessary to capture 
increment changes.
	
2.	
Run the data bulk copy.
	
3.	
Stop all changes and take the old site offline.
	
4.	
Perform catchup changes.
	
5.	
Delete all triggers from the old database.
	
6.	
Turn the new Magento 2 site online.

Magento 2 Migration Tools
In this section, you will find the most robust tools designed to make Magento 2 migration 
seamless. Official and third-party software solutions are described.
Code Migration Toolkit
A new tool that simplifies migration to Magento 2 has been developed. As members of 
the Magento community, we’ve been waiting for a new migration instrument aimed at 
modules since the first announcement of Magento 2—and finally, we’ve got it. Dubbed 
the Magento Code Migration Toolkit, the software solution will essentially change the way 
you work with custom Magento extensions while trying to port them from 1.x to 2.0.
With the Magento Code Migration Toolkit, you get scripts that streamline the 
conversion of custom 1.x modules to Magento 2 by automating time-consuming 
processes. The software solution automatically converts such important things as module 
directory structure, as well as PHP, config.xml, and layout.xml files.
Please note that the Magento Code Migration Toolkit requires that some manual 
operations be performed. For instance, conversion scripts must be run in a specified 
order. Also, it is necessary to manually edit some files in the installation.
The following are the prerequisites:
• 
PHP 5.5.x+
• 
Composer package management software
• 
A designated source (Magento 1.x)
• 
Target Magento 2 directories
The installation procedure and module migration process are described on the 
Magento Code Migration Toolkit page on GitHub.

Official Magento CE Data Migration Tool
Painless migration from Magento 1.x to Magento 2 is possible with the Magento CE 
Data Migration Tool. Currently, the extension supports the following components: data, 
themes, extensions, and customizations.
The Magento 2 Data Migration Tool provides the ability to move store configurations, 
promotions, customers, products, and order data from Magento 1.x to Magento 2.
Please note that code is not ported due to its inability to be automated.
Still, there is no particular information about porting extensions. Check GitHub for 
the additional data. Developers are working hard with the community to provide the 
ability to port Magento modules. Magento 2 relies on an innovative approach to themes 
and customization. Thus, merchants and developers will need to change the existing

products in order to get all the abilities of new shopping experiences. Don’t forget to 
check official documentations for themes22, layouts23, and customizations24.
The Magento CE Data Migration Tool works with Community Edition 1.9.1.0. 
Support for CE 1.6.x, CE 1.7.x, CE 1.8.x, and CE 1.9.x is expected.
It’s important to comply with these requirements:
• 
Set up your Magento 2.0 to these system requirements25.
• 
Set up the topology and design of a new system with your existing 
Magento 1.x system in mind.
• 
Please note that Magento 2.0 cron jobs are prohibited.
• 
Back up your Magento 2 database after installation. Do this as 
soon as possible. You can also dump26 it.
• 
The Magento CE Data Migration Tool should have a network 
connection to the databases of both Magento 1.x and Magento 2.
• 
The ports in your firewall should be opened. Provide your 
databases and the migration tool with the ability to communicate 
with each other.
• 
You can replicate your Magento 1.x database to provide 
redundancy in the event of unexpected issues.
• 
Migrate the existing 1.x custom code and extension to  
Magento 2.0.
• 
Ask the providers of your extension if you’ve ported them 
successfully.

CHAPTER 4
Enterprise
This chapter begins with a detailed guide to getting all Magento EE features on the 
Community platform. Later, I share other features that are useful for reaching new 
ecommerce levels.
Turning Magento Community Edition into 
Magento Enterprise Edition (How to get all 
Magento EE features on the Community Platform)
Although the Magento Enterprise Edition offers many more opportunities than the 
Community Edition does, you can always make your CE online store much more robust. 
In this chapter, I share my experience with turning a Magento Community website into a 
Magento Enterprise–class ecommerce solution.
First, I should tell you about the advantages of Magento Enterprise over Magento 
Community. The platform is better optimized for a large number of products. It includes 
full-page caching by default. There are integrated rollback and backup systems in the 
Enterprise Edition. The platform is highly scalable and it has an out-of-the-box enhanced 
tax calculation system. There is also a faster checkout, as well as tons of advanced admin 
features, such as the ability to easily manage customer attributes. I must mention that a 
gift-wrapping option is built into Magento EE. Furthermore, the Enterprise Edition offers 
advanced marketing and segmentation, as well as private sales.

Chapter 4 ■ Enterprise
178
The features in Magento EE include PCI compliance; gift registries, points, and cards; 
a return management authorization system; Solr Search; automated email; multiple 
custom landing pages; cross-sell, upsell, and recommended products; and customer-
assigned shopping. Another important advantage of the platform is 24/7 developer 
support. In addition, all patches are pre-installed, which makes your store more secure. 
Luckily, you can get all of these features within your CE website.
But what are the drawbacks of Enterprise Edition? The platform costs $12,000 per 
installation per year, which is a lot for small and mid-sized businesses. In fact, Enterprise 
Edition is nothing more than Community Edition with several additional modules: 
CE consists of 65 modules, whereas EE includes 41 more extensions. Note that these 
additional modules can be installed with the help of third-party extensions. Some of the 
modules are bug fixes. Some of them are considered useless. You will probably never 
need all the features exclusively offered by EE, but they are mandatorily pre-installed. 
Enterprise Edition is heavier and slower than the Community Edition, as it includes a lot 
of additional software, which decreases website performance.
If the lack of support in CE seems to be a problem, install paid extensions. You will 
not only get the missing features, but also receive support from extension developers who 
will help you install, manage, and update purchased modules. Please note that you only 
have to pay once, whereas EE payments are annual.
Take a look at these blog posts for additional information: http://goo.gl/GUpa8R 
and http://goo.gl/fqF2gd. You can also watch this video: https://goo.gl/Lwcn3M.
The total price of all paid (unfortunately, there are no free alternatives for every 
module) extensions is $722. Since a basic hosting price is $20 a month (https://goo.
gl/8NeYTe) and the average price of a good Theme Forest template is $100 (http://goo.
gl/AQ14oI ), you can run an Enterprise-level Magento Community based online website 
for less than $1,000!
Order Archiving
“Increase store performance and provide efficiencies in store management through an 
order archiving module, enabling merchants to archive orders after a configurable time. 
Orders are still available to both administrators and customers, providing increased 
performance by storing historical orders in an archive.”
The following two extensions significantly extend Magento order management and 
provide the order archiving feature for the Magento Community Edition: http://goo.
gl/4FM9eF and http://goo.gl/qlUKxj.

Chapter 4 ■ Enterprise
179
Solr Search
“An alternative to the standard Magento search, Solr Search offers site-search options 
and enhancements to the speed, quality, and relevancy of search results provided to 
customers. Performance and search quality are improved with layered navigation and 
features like spelling/ synonyms/stopwords and weighted attributes.”
Solr Search is not the only way to improve the Community Edition’s default search 
option. You can check the most reliable solutions on the Firebear blog here: http://goo.
gl/jbpPj2. I recommend that you pay attention to the Elasticsearch and Sphinx engines 
as alternative solutions to the default Magento CE search, or you can still use the Solr 
engine offered by Magento EE. There is even a free module designed for running Solr 
Search on Community Edition. You can download it from GitHub (https://goo.gl/
cZTjoc) or Magento Connect (http://goo.gl/H6SEzE).
Solr Bridge Search is a paid solution. It provides Enterprise-level support and 
cloud-based features. You can get Solr Bridge Search for your Community Edition store 
here: http://goo.gl/85n6Tp. There is also an appropriate page on Magento Connect: 
http://goo.gl/FA297. Additionally, you can see the extension’s demo here: http://goo.

Full Page Caching
“Enhance performance with caching of primary pages, including category, product and 
CMS pages for all users, including session users (excludes personal information). Caching 
of pages generally improves server response times and reduces load.”
There are tons of amazing Full Page Cache extensions for Magento Community 
websites. All of these modules are designed to improve your store performance and make 
it faster than any Magento Enterprise site is. The best free open source Full Page Cache 
extension is Lesti FPC: https://goo.gl/NHxxDs. It’s a good basic solution that can be 
replaced at any time with more robust software.
Figure 4-2.  Solr Search

Chapter 4 ■ Enterprise
181
Another important aspect of full-page caching in the Community Edition is cache 
storage. I recommend that you use Redis, since all FPC extensions support both its free 
and paid versions. Thanks to a huge and productive community, we have a free way to 
implement on CE: https://goo.gl/ADmnV4.
The best paid Enterprise-level Magento Full Page Cache extension is Extendware 
Page Cache: Full Page Cache (http://goo.gl/s4DeLH ). I’ve used it with many high-load 
Magento Community projects and it always shows amazing performance. Dozens of 
flexible settings, smooth integration with Magento templates, the “hole punches” system 
for handling dynamic Ajax blocks, partial cache flushing for specific entities—all of these 
features are available in the Community Edition. Please note that the default Magento 
Enterprise FPC system provides narrower opportunities.
See a full list of The Best Magento Full Page Cache Extensions1.
In addition to Full Page Cache, it’s important to get a full-page cache warmer—
an extension that allows you to pre-generate FPC for every page of your website. A 
crawler/warmer visits every page of a website by performing a cron job, or you can do 
everything manually. As a result, your visitors get cached pages with amazing speed, 
which significantly decreases the bounce rate among first-time visitors. The best free 
open source solution is Magento Full Page Cache Crawler by Maveric (https://goo.
gl/3pJOdw). It provides the ability to crawl pages manually or by performing cron from a 
command line and Magento admin.
The best Enterprise-level solution that supports multiple store views and currencies, 
and crawls all kinds of custom pages and modules, is Extendware’s Cache Crawler: Cache 
Warmer (http://goo.gl/cyXZy7). The module leads to a significant performance boost 
if used along with the Extendware Full Page Cache extension. Together, they provide 
unique opportunities related to cache logging—extensions collect the most visited 
custom URLs (as well as any kind of URL—filters, search results, sorting, etc.) and then 
crawls them. As a result, you get bounce rate reduction, since visitors always get cached 
pages at lightning-fast speed. Although Magento Enterprise Edition provides FPC, it 
doesn’t have a built-in cache warmer.

183
Using only Full Page Cache, you will not optimize your performance. Keep in mind 
that it is also necessary to take care of server-side improvements. By only using Nginx, the 
latest PHP version, alternative MySQL engines like MariaDB, and a proper cache strategy, 
you can make your Magento Community Edition faster than EE. (I shed light on these 
improvements in Chapter 1.) Also pay attention to The Best Full Page Cache Warmers/
Crawlers for Magento2.
Optimized Indexing
“Optimized indexing enables significantly faster indexing with limited to no impact to the 
customer’s shopping experience. This makes it easier to add and update products more 
frequently while ensuring URLs, promotions, navigational menus and product search 
tools are always up to date while never slowing down site performance. Incremental 
indexing reduces the need to perform a full re-index and offer most indexing operations 
are automated.”
Indexing is one of the biggest performance issues on both CE and EE. Product 
quantity increase always leads to a rising demand of time and resources. Fortunately, a 
Magento Community website can be optimized with the help of appropriate extensions, 
which are described next. All of these extensions significantly reduce the time required 
for the process of indexing, and run reindexing in the background.
A free, open source, community-driven solution is FastIndexer (https://goo.gl/
PNfT5l). Another tool for speeding up catalog search reindexing is Sonassi Fast Search 
Index (http://goo.gl/mnfZa2).
Another Enterprise-level paid extension is Fast Asynchronous Re-indexing  
(http://goo.gl/v03pvs).

Configurable Order Tracking Widget
With this widget, customers can track the status of existing orders and returns without 
any need to log in to their accounts. There is a free community extension called Track

Support for Alternate Media Storage: CDN and Database
Media files can be stored within the database or CDN (content delivery network) on a 
Community Edition store due to CloudFlare (https://goo.gl/hEiO). Being the best free 
CDN solution, the platform can be integrated with your website without any extensions; 
it just requires several manual changes. As a result, you get lots of additional security 
and performance features. When using your own servers as CDN, utilize the following 
extension: ImageCDN (http://goo.gl/prcjWt). There is also a CloudFront CDN 
(http://goo.gl/OXgECi), if you don’t like CloudFlare.

PA-DSS Certification/Payment Bridge Magento
“Secure Payment Bridge is a PA-DSS (Payment Application Data Security Standard) 
Certified payment application, enabling merchants to efficiently attain PCI compliance 
with minimum cost and effort. Customers will also be able to securely save their credit 
card information for future transactions. “
There are several ways to make your Magento website PCI compliant. Bear in mind 
that Magento CE is regarded as PCI compliant as long as you aren’t storing credit card 
data, since there are no requirements for the encryption of other information. Thus, 
for making your Community Edition store compliant, you should eliminate the use 
of sensitive information within your website by redirecting customers to third-party 
payment platforms.
Figure 4-5.  CloudFront CDN

Chapter 4 ■ Enterprise
187
The second method requires using PCI-compliant gateways, such as PayPal or 
Authorize.net (http://goo.gl/cNBKFC). Check our list of payment gateways here: Best 
Payment Gateways for Modern eCommerce4. There are lots of PCI-compliant solutions 
described in the blog post.

Strong Data Encryption, Hashing, and Key Management
“Strong data encryption based on AES-256 and strong hashing based on SHA-256. 
Database keys are easily managed and updated.”
The Magento Community also has an encryption key feature (http://goo.gl/cNBKFC), 
but it is not very useful, so I recommend that you to check the Magento Security guide 
mentioned in Chapter 1.

Backup and Rollback
“Manage and schedule a variety of backup operations with the option to rollback the 
changes to reverse any modifications. This feature is particularly useful when testing new 
modules or customizations, or when upgrading to a new version of Magento. You can 
review specific customizations and their impact on the new code. (I do not recommend 
using this feature in your production environment.) There are three types of backup 
supported:
• 
System backup
• 
Database backup
• 
Database and media backup staging
Database backup could be performed in CE, but it is not the best way to back up 
your store, because it is not consistent and it cannot be restored in some situations. Thus, 
it is better to use Sypex Dumper (https://goo.gl/Imndik), which is a lightweight open 
source tool with a simple web interface. Sypex Dumper allows you to back up and rapidly 
compress a MySQL database, making it stable. Additionally, it provides support for 
broken databases, as well as different types of import and export strategies.
Another reliable solution is PhpMyAdmin (https://goo.gl/Ab4ZO5). This tool is 
useful for direct database management, including base URL changing. If you want to  
back up your Magento data to the Amazon S3 cloud, use cop_magento_backup  
(https://goo.gl/cL3T31).
Merging and Rollback of Content
“Create a staging site to test new categories, product information, promotions etc. 
Content can be merged to the live site after approval, either on-demand or per a 
schedule. Supports on-demand, scheduled merges and rollbacks of content.”
Merging and rollback of content in the Community Edition is available with 
MageFlow (http://goo.gl/w9PkPC). It is an Enterprise-level service for Magento content 
migration. firegento-contentsync (https://goo.gl/iD9eKM) is a free open source 
community-driven solution for content synchronization. Genmato (https://goo.gl/

Customer Attribute Management
“Improve sales and marketing efforts with advanced attribute management. Customer 
account and address attributes are managed by the Magento Administrator interface and 
then used to create customized marketing campaigns and customer profiles.”
Since an individual approach to customers is essential, an additional customer 
attribute is helpful. Unfortunately, Magento Community does not allow you to manage 
customer attributes at all. You can easily change the situation by applying a free module 
that offers customer information collection using Customer Attributes (http://goo.
gl/AnnZjU). With the aid of this module, you will be able to use new custom attributes 
promotions, export, other extensions, and so forth. There is also a paid solution by the 
Amasty team called Customer Attributes5.

Administrator Permission Roles on Website and Store 
Levels: Price and Promotion Permission
“Restrict access roles so that staff can view only the data to the stores relevant to them. 
Merchants can create and control multiple admin roles for reading and editing prices and 
promotions.”
A free community-driven extension for advanced admin permissions and roles 
control is AdvancedAcl (https://goo.gl/9RS4cH). The best Enterprise-level module is 
Advanced Permissions by Aitoc (http://goo.gl/ejMD0T).

Logging of Administrator Actions
“Track and review all actions taken by administrator users, with the ability to see views, 
edits and deletions of information. Logs are associated to specific administrator users, 
with the ability to see the action taken, when it was made, and more.”
FireGento_AdminMonitoring is a free, open source solution for recording and 
viewing Magento admin actions on Community Edition. Admin Logger is a feature-rich 
commercial module.
Category View and Purchase Permissions per Customer 
Group (Limited Catalog Access)
“Manage viewing or purchasing items access by customer group. Access can be 
controlled globally or by specific category.”
This feature is a must-have for almost any B2B Magento shop. You can use a great, 
free, open source solution by Magento master Vinai Kopp called Groups Catalog 2 
(https://goo.gl/iwWJzG), as well as a more advanced paid tool by aheadWorks called

increasing customer loyalty. Points can be awarded based on a wide range of transactions 
and customers. Redemption rules can be controlled by merchants based on a variety of 
parameters including balances, expiration, customer history, conversion rate and more.”
Unfortunately, there are only paid modules designed to provide Magento CE with 
the Reward Points feature. The most popular paid extension is the J2T Reward Points + 
Referral program (http://goo.gl/AeGSQ7). It costs only $50. An advanced Enterprise-
level solution is Sweet Tooth (https://goo.gl/yNa7xC). It provides perfect integration

Multiple Wish Lists
“Customers can save products to multiple wish lists and copy or move items from list

merchants can review them to learn about their customers’ wants and needs.”
MultiWishlist (https://goo.gl/brHT75) is a free open source solution that allows 
customers to create multiple wish lists on Magento CE.
Add to Cart by SKU (Stockkeeping Unit)
“Streamline the ordering process, especially for B2B customers, by enabling them to 
enter a list of SKUs without having to go into product pages. This simplifies large orders, 
recurring orders and ordering based on offline catalogs.”
Quick or fast-order capabilities are possible on Community Edition due to a wide 
variety of specific extensions. I’d like to draw your attention to QuickOrders (https://
goo.gl/IKG97i). Discover more paid solutions in our blog post on Firebear: Best Magento

implement the Add to Cart by SKU feature on CE.
Return Management Authorization (RMA)
“Enables of customer and merchant administration of returns with support for partial 
order and individual item returns, customer notifications, shipping methods and more.”

Content Management System
“Magento’s CMS uses a WYSIWYG editor with support for rich content. Build complex 
content pages, create multiple versions of a page, restrict publishing privileges, and create 
menus. Easily add CMS pages to the navigation menu and create, copy or delete different 
CMS hierarchy trees for each website and store view individually or en masse.”
Content is vital in every ecommerce business, since it is responsible for free organic 
traffic from search engines, and targets visitors ready to purchase from your website. 
Thus, you need a convenient CMS to simplify routine processes related to content. The 
default Magento CMS system looks very limited; that’s why you should improve it. The 
following are the most reliable extensions.
• 
FireGento_FlexCms (https://goo.gl/Y2dSOv): A free open 
source solution for improving content management within

Customer Segmentation, Targeted Promotions, and

“Segment customers into groups and optimize marketing initiatives by identifying 
specific customer groups using specific characteristics (address, gender, etc.) and/or 
value (purchase history, on-site browsing, etc.). Advanced segmentation capabilities 
include the ability to identify unknown site visitors. Whether they’re new visitors or 
returning customers who have not logged in, you’re able to identify and target them with 
special promotions to convert browsers into buyers.”
Although customer segmentation is an Enterprise-exclusive feature, you can easily 
get it on your CE webstore after installing one of the following extensions. Both are paid, 
but they are the most reliable solutions available on the market. Also, check the part

device to device. Once a customer logs in to a site, a long-term cookie is established for 
that browser/device combination and the customer can now view the contents of their 
shopping cart in subsequent sessions without logging in again.”

Multichannel Marketing
Multichannel marketing relies on different channels to reach customers. Such channels 
include retail stores, websites, mail order catalogs, and direct personal communication by 
emails, letters, text messages, or phone calls. Customers are involved in browsing, buying, 
returning, and pre- and post-sale services.
The objective of this marketing type is to simplify shopping from the perspective 
of a buyer. As a result, companies providing multichannel marketing increase customer 
loyalty, attract new target audiences, and gain more revenues.
Being a relatively new trend, multichannel marketing in ecommerce is already 
represented with various multichannel sale services and extensions. It relies on the 
same principles as multichannel marketing in brick-and-mortar retail, but has a limited 
number of instruments represented by different marketplaces and online stores.
I’m not insisting you create a brick-and-mortar store in addition to your ecommerce 
store, but I highly recommend that you implement core principles of multichannel 
marketing by integrating with core marketplaces. Luckily, you don’t have to perform 
everything manually, as there is M2E Pro (http://goo.gl/K8ujr).
With this extension, your products are listed on eBay, Amazon, and Rakuten in just 
10 minutes. Configure the module after its installation, select the products that you’d 
like to see on these marketplaces, and you are done. Moreover, you’ll get a user-friendly 
interface for managing your sales channels from Magento admin. The following are other 
M2E Pro features:
• 
Full control over your inventory
• 
Centralized data management
• 
Unlimited accounts
• 
Scalability
• 
Task automation
• 
Order management
• 
Listing tools support
The integration of all three marketplaces is absolutely free. Furthermore, there are 
free support options offered by M2E Pro.

strategies include M.O.M. (http://goo.gl/dyOh1u), StoreFeeder (http://goo.gl/PTk62F),

PIM
Product information management (PIM) software generates a set of product data that is 
up-to-date output for different media systems, such as ERP. PIM tools can be used for the 
integration of web sites with offline business. Moreover, they are aimed at producing data 
required for print catalogs or their digital equivalents.
Information management, implemented with the help of a PIM system, provides 
support for multiple locations and languages, making diverse partners or affiliates much 
more connected. All the members of such a system get a centralized interface, where they 
can modify product information in a cost-effective and consistently accurate manner.
Since modern retail involves numerous product data channels, brick-and-mortar 
stores are usually complemented by websites, mobile applications, print catalogs, and 
different digital feeds. Thus, PIM software becomes a tool designed for the organization 
and structuralization of data from different departments, systems, and people.
A PIM system utilizes a centralized and media-independent approach to data 
maintenance. As a result, a whole enterprise gets a simplified system for purchasing, 
production, and communication, as well as a new data flow suitable for repeated use in 
multiple systems. Moreover, foreign languages are no longer an obstacle.
Five Reasons to Use PIM in eCommerce
The following explains five reasons to use PIM in ecommerce.
• 
With a PIM system, you are able to structure your information without 
spending too much time on this process. The appropriate software 
helps you understand how your products should be classified; 
the number of attributes required for your ecommerce store; core 
principles of navigation on your website; major data sources with their 
priority and influences; a required level of data quality, and so forth.
• 
Product information management software is often used for 
information enrichment. Spreadsheets and ERPs never provide 
the most comprehensive data offered by PIM platforms. In 
addition, you are able to avoid different headaches, such as poor 
product pages or manual form filling.
• 
Since the work of recommendation engines and search tools is 
based on product data, you need to provide these tools with the 
most comprehensive information about your products in order to 
satisfy visitors with the most relevant results. Such information is 
generated by PIM systems.

Chapter 4 ■ Enterprise
205
• 
Multichannel support is another reason to use PIM. You can 
always connect your ecommerce website with a brick-and-
mortar store or a mobile app using product information 
management software. Note that it is always easier to connect 
your Magento store with new channels through PIM than to make 
customizations directly to the website.
• 
It’s more profitable to add PIM system to your enterprise right 
now, because with the growth of your digital store, the costs 
required for the integration will increase as well.

Asim (http://goo.gl/4uRCvg), Salsify (http://goo.gl/Q7rZRq), inRiver (http://
goo.gl/NgbQXi), and Hybris software (https://goo.gl/fOvDTP) are examples of PIM 
systems widely used in ecommerce. A full list of services with short descriptions and all 
necessary links is here: http://goo.gl/bH5A29.
ERP
An enterprise resource planning (ERP) system is a set of software tools for business 
management. Usually, it is a suite of integrated applications that an enterprise or a 
company can utilize for data gathering, storage, management, and interpretation. ERP 
covers core business processes, tracking such business resources as raw materials, cash, 
production capacity, and stocks in real time. It also monitors the status of business 
commitments: payrolls, orders, and purchase orders. With an ERP system, you can turn 
your Magento store into a more robust and profitable business unit. To achieve this 
goal, you need a proper extension. Therefore, I am going to describe the most popular 
solutions next.
The first one is Embedded ERP. This extension is developed to help you with fulfilling 
orders and purchases, managing stocks, and performing other operations. Contrary 
to other similar solutions, Embedded ERP was developed especially for ecommerce 
businesses, so it fits perfectly with the Magento platform.
The extension covers four areas: stock management, purchasing, order preparation, 
product availability, and order planning. It supports multiple warehouses, stock level 
alerts, barcodes, inventory tracking, and sales history. Moreover, Embedded ERP lets 
you manage supply needs, purchase orders, and suppliers. The solution provides control 
over mass order fulfillment, printing, picking, and shipping labels. Advanced product 
availability options and order forecasts are also among the extension’s strong points.
The tool is 100% open source and highly customizable; it costs $649. You can get 
additional information here: http://goo.gl/DHoxVH.

CRM
Customer relationship management (CRM) software creates a system aimed at managing 
a company’s interactions with both current and future customers. CRM’s spheres of 
influence include marketing, sales, customer services, and technical support. Customer 
relationship management involves using different technologies and techniques to 
organize, synchronize, and automate all the aforementioned activities.
You can easily integrate your Magento store with any CRM system by installing 
appropriate extensions. The most reliable modules are represented next. Note that all of 
them work with certain CRM platforms.
Thus, SugarCRM Bridge helps with connecting your offline store to an online one by 
synchronizing information about your business activities. Having installed this extension, you 
connect your Magento store with SugarCRM as well. Accordingly, the module synchronizes 
purchases and site users with customers, opportunities, and cases from CRM’s database. 
SugarCRM Bridge costs $299 and you can purchase it here: http://goo.gl/gBaH8I.
OroCRM Bridge represents open source CRM tools for ecommerce. The extension 
includes different built-in customer service and sales performance improvement tools. It 
also provides dashboards and out-of-the-box reports to better understand your customers. 
You can download the OroCRM Bridge extension for free: http://goo.gl/O1PSQ1.
By installing OneSaas Connect, you will be able to integrate Magento with OneSaas 
CRM. As a result, the extension will synchronize your sales, contact, accounting, and billing 
data between the store and the customer relationship management system on an hourly 
or a daily basis. Although the OneSaas Connect extension is free, you have to pay for the 
different plans offered by the CRM. Get more information here: http://goo.gl/WHbdos.
If you are looking for salesforce integration, pay attention to eCS CloudGento. The 
module works with customer, inventory, order, and shipping information from your 
Magento store, and integrates it with the service, which is among the leaders of on-
demand cloud-based CRM solutions. Take into consideration that the extension unites all 
data from Magento, Amazon, eBay, Volusion, and other platforms in one place. You can

SAP
SAP is a company that develops software for enterprises in all industries. The acronym 
stands for systems, applications, and products (in data processing). SAP ERP is an 
enterprise resource planning system developed by the company. There is also a solution 
stack of the company’s technology products known as SAP NetWeaver. It consists of 
such building blocks as Portal, BI, Visual Composer, AutoID Infrastructure, Composite 
Application Framework, Development Infrastructure, Identity Management, Single  
Sign-On, and so forth.
Another important set of products is represented with industry-specific software. 
Tools for small enterprises and midsize companies include SAP Business One and SAP 
Business ByDesign.
The basic idea behind SAP is to provide users with the ability to work within 
a corporate database accessible from a range of business apps with all necessary 
management features.
With the appearance of mySAP.com, the company added business applications for 
customer relationship, supply chain, and other kinds of management. SAP’s portfolio 
includes mobile business apps as well.

As you can see, there are a lot of different software products developed by 
the company. But what are the benefits? Let’s discuss some core SAP ecommerce 
opportunities.
• 
Your warehouse, store, and website are tightly connected with 
SAP: a stock level is updated in real time; you always know when 
it is time to reorder; your online customers can see a current 
availability of goods.
• 
You get a database of your online customers: this data streamlines 
ordering and shipping processes; the appropriate areas of the 
supply chain get all necessary information on time; customers 
enter their information only once and have the ability to track 
their purchases.
• 
SAP ERP integration optimizes the work of your administrators: 
they get all data in one central point with real-time automated 
processes; all manual store data updates are eliminated; and 
admin time is minimized.
Holding the leading position among all ERP providers, SAP offers dozens of useful 
features, which are especially important for big businesses. SAP ERP supports such 
aspects of ecommerce as multiple locations, international operations, enhances analytics, 
and so forth.
Furthermore, a standalone ERP solution by SAP is constantly updated. Since there 
is a whole suite of business products that you can add to the main platform, the solution 
offers extra flexibility and an advanced level of customization.
Note that there are a lot of Magento extensions for connecting your ecommerce store 
with SAP ERP. Unfortunately, they are all different, so you should choose the one that 
suits the needs of your business.
It is also necessary to understand that after installing a module, you should perform 
a lot of configurations, because both Magento and SAP ERP are complex systems. Luckily, 
there is the SAP Integration and Certification Center (http://goo.gl/EC3xXj), as well as 
several Magento companies that work with SAP ERP integration. For instance, you can 
rely on InSync (http://goo.gl/hZFGoA), eBridge Connections (http://goo.gl/8UBLMX), 
Speed 4 Trade (https://goo.gl/ybk2r3), and Netresearch (http://goo.gl/s7dFaH).
Please note that extensions aimed at SAP/Magento integration are not as effective 
as solutions offered by the aforementioned companies. That’s why I don’t describe them 
in this book; but you can always check our Firebear blog post related to SAP integration: 
Systems Applications Products integration with Magento18. There you will find additional 
information on Magento extensions and integration.

Dropshipping
Dropshipping is a special retail fulfillment method that eliminates the necessity to 
keep goods in stock. Instead, a retailer transfers customer orders to a wholesaler or 
manufacturer, who ships goods directly to customers. Thus, an ecommerce merchant 
never handles a product.
Dropshipping is easy to get started and requires much less capital than other retail 
methods. Other benefits include low overhead expenses, a wide selection of products, 
reduced risks, location independence, and high scalability. You can put products in front 
of an audience and start selling without getting stuck with unsold inventory or spending a 
lot up front.
If you are really interested in dropshipping, check out the uDropship extension 
and Doba platform. These are the most reliable solutions, preferred by thousands of 
ecommerce merchants worldwide.
As you might have guessed, the uDropship Magento extension streamlines 
communication between dropshippers and online stores. As a result, you, as an 
ecommerce merchant, get the ability to track shipments and orders handled by your 
dropship company or vendors. uDropship by Unirgy has a user-friendly interface and 
features necessary for gaining the most out of dropshipping. The extension costs $950 and 
offers a seamless upgrade to the uMarketplace solution. You can download uDropship 
here: https://goo.gl/uIh78k.
Doba (https://goo.gl/eQb2DO) is a platform that empowers retailers and wholesale 
suppliers to connect to do business. As a retailer, you get instant access to more than 2 
million wholesale products from a growing supplier base. Thus, rather than working out 
relationships with new suppliers, you can access all of them through a single interface. 
Moreover, having installed the Doba Dropshipper Integration extension, you simplify the 
integration of your Magento store with this platform. The module costs $129 and provides 
the ability to automatically import products from Doba into your ecommerce store. You 
can get the extension here: http://goo.gl/1FhBTN.
The Best Drop Shipping Extensions for Magento19
B2B
Business-to-business is a complex of commerce transactions that occur among 
companies. The most common examples of B2B relations are transactions between 
manufacturers and wholesalers, or wholesalers and retailers.
B2B and B2C businesses have a lot of common features, but there is one 
fundamental difference: the target audience. B2B companies work with other businesses, 
while B2C companies are aimed at the end user. The audience of a B2B company can 
include only one consumer, while such a situation is impossible with B2C. B2B customers 
always buy with their heads, not their hearts. Their decisions are cold and logical. In the 
B2C world, the situation is often the opposite.
19https://firebearstudio.com/blog/the-best-drop-shipping-extensions-for-magento.html

Chapter 4 ■ Enterprise
211
It’s very important to understand how this affects ecommerce websites. Due to 
intense competition, B2C ecommerce websites are forced to stand out from a crowd to 
be noticed, but it doesn’t mean that B2B websites should have a less noticeable design or 
don’t need any stunning features.
Furthermore, B2C websites have many more visitors, but a lower conversion rate. 
Thus, end customer–related merchants spend lots of resources on increasing this index. 
In business-to-business relations, these goals are not of the highest priority. Instead, 
B2B entrepreneurs focus on different business problems, such as providing real-time 
information and necessary connections.
It is also worth mentioning that B2B ecommerce websites use complicated customer 
logins, while B2C sites often rely on unobtrusive guest checkouts. B2B customers prefer 
long-term collaboration; they might have schedules, specific deals, and setups that 
are impossible to manage on a website with a guest checkout. At the same time, B2C 
customers are looking for new unobtrusive purchases without any registrations or logins.
Product information on both types of sites is also different. B2B ecommerce is 
impossible without explainer videos, spec sheets, how-to’s, webinars, and tutorials. All of 
these materials can be used on B2C sites as well, but less often and in smaller quantities.
The checkout process is another distinctive feature of these relation types. On B2C 
websites, it must be as short as possible. On B2B stores, a better devised approach is 
required, since B2B purchases are more unique and complex.
Fortunately, you can easily upgrade your Magento website according to B2B 
requirements. You just need to spend a few hours installing special extensions. The 
most important tools are listed on the Firebear blog here: Magento B2B extensions and 
solutions20. Additionally, you can check the appropriate section on Magento Connect: 
http://goo.gl/BdF7n.
And let’s not forget the Magento B2B Program. Although Magento was a B2B-
friendly platform out of the box, there still were a lot of vital improvements required for 
those merchants whose businesses were aimed at other companies. Having installed 
extensions, they were able to turn their Magento websites into contemporary B2B 
platforms. Unfortunately, it was not the most convenient way to get a proper B2B 
experience, but it was the only one available. Since the Magento team is always trying to 
improve the existing platform, a new program was recently.
While B2B buying is becoming more B2C-like, the segment has a lot of new 
requirements. If an ecommerce website does not offer a dynamically changing set of 
features, customers will easily move on to competitors who provide this experience. 
Luckily, you can prevent your business from losing clients with the Magento B2B 
Program.
20https://firebearstudio.com/blog/magento-business-to-business-b2b-extensions-
and-solutions.html

Chapter 4 ■ Enterprise
212
The platform now offers a consumer-like B2B experiences combined with flexibility 
and stability, so you can change any aspect of your work flow according to unique 
requirements of your clients or company. Moreover, there is a robust set of APIs designed 
for easy integration with all possible external systems widely used in a B2B segment. With 
the Magento B2B Program, you will be able to do the following:
• 
Provide a consumerized self-serve shopping experience
• 
Improve operational efficiency by getting higher-value data
• 
Get an Enterprise-level platform with top-notch functionality, 
performance, extensibility, and flexibility
Magento B2B features include advanced account management, quick bulk orders, 
inventory tracking across multiple locations, negotiated pricing terms for each client, ERP 
integration, and mobile support.
As you can see, Magento offers a lot for making your B2B store even more user 
friendly, but this doesn’t mean that you can ignore the modules mentioned. Utilize the 
new opportunity along with existing solutions to get the highest possible business results. 
You can find more information about the Magento B2B program here21.
Magento B2B
This one is an internal management system for ecommerce that connects an online 
shopping system, an accounting system to a logistics system, and an inventory tracking 
system. With this extension, your business runs faster and more accurately, saving you 
much in costs.
Magento B2B22
Magento Extensions for Quick/Fast Order
You can also utilize Magento Extensions for Quick/Fast Order in your B2B business.  
The best modules are gathered here: Magento Extensions for Quick/Fast Order23.
Customer Activation
This Magento extension provides additional control over customers by making it 
impossible to log in until the account has been activated by the admin. It is a very useful 
feature, especially if you operate a big enterprise and want to avoid problems related to 
incorrect information posted by your customers.

Multivendor Marketplace
Another Enterprise-level feature provided by Magento is a multivendor marketplace. 
You can utilize the platform for running this type of ecommerce business. The core 
difference between a multivendor marketplace and an ordinary ecommerce shop lies in 
the approach to traffic generation and SEO. In a marketplace, you always need to split 
your marketing and SEO strategies into two separate branches: one at aimed at vendors 
and sellers, the other at buyers. The same is about the construction of your website. As an 
ecommerce store owner, you won’t need to sell on your own, as you will get interest from 
what your vendors are selling.
If this idea seems expedient, you can utilize the uMarketplace extension by Unirgy, 
since it is the best available solution. The module will transform your ecommerce 
store into a powerful online shopping mall. All your vendors will be able to sell their 
products through specific microsites, but within a centralized product catalog. In 
addition, uMarketplace provides all the tools necessary for configuring and automating 
a dropshipping workflow on your store. Other useful features include multiple ways 
to integrate with vendors, different shipping options, advanced order and shipment 
management, commission rates, various promotions, and fully configurable and 
controllable customer/vendor interactions. The uMarketplace extension costs $1,650. 
You can get it here: http://goo.gl/vb2Nhd. Don’t forget about support and assistance, 
since Unirgy offers these options for its clients. The company has an amazing team that is 
always ready to help.
I should also mention that every Magento template from ThemeForest can be 
adapted to uMarketplace. The same for extensions: most high-quality modules can be 
configured according to the requirements of a multiple-vendor marketplace. In both 
cases you can rely on extensions and a template developer, or on the Unirgy team.
The situation with payment systems is more complicated. Not all providers offer 
multivendor features, so I recommend that you check PayPal Marketplace Payouts: 
https://goo.gl/yWyJ2S. For a full list of solutions, go here: Best Magento extensions for 
building Magento based multi vendor marketplace25.
Dynamic Pricing
Due to its flexible pricing strategy, dynamic pricing is widely used across different 
industries, but it is relatively new to ecommerce. Among all pricing strategies, it is the 
most relevant to the needs of electronic commerce.
To create a successful dynamic pricing strategy, you need tons of information about 
the market. For various industries, it requires a lot of time and effort to collect necessary 
data, but ecommerce is an exception. In the age of big data, online retailers can easily get all 
information related to pricing of major competitors, key market trends, or sales volume 
for a certain period. With such abilities, ecommerce creates a perfect environment for the 
implementation of dynamic pricing, which is no longer a privilege of giant companies. It has 
become an effective way to boost sales and revenues—even for the smallest retailers.
25https://firebearstudio.com/blog/best-magento-extensions-for-build-magento-
based-multi-vendor-marketplace.html

Chapter 4 ■ Enterprise
214
At first blush, dynamic pricing seems to be all about price changes, but it is not true. 
Its second major purpose is surveillance of competitor pricing. Keep in mind that your 
price matters only in relation to what your competitors offer. You don’t need to provide 
the lowest possible price to become successful; instead, you should rely on relative 
pricing. And all your relative prices should be flexible in order to stay effective. Therefore, 
dynamic pricing is the best possible ecommerce pricing strategy. You can implement 
it within your Magento store with the aid of the following platforms: Wiser, Ventata, or 
Boomerang Commerce. See our full list of DPO solutions here: Best Dynamic Pricing 
Optimization (DPO) Services for eCommerce26.
For example, Wiser’s portfolio consists of multiple products designed to provide 
retailers with the ability to stay competitive and profitable. WisePricer is a flagship 
solution of the company. It is a dynamic pricing engine, which works in real time. 
WisePricer monitors market situation, analyzes data, and automatically sets new prices 
according to received information. It provides ecommerce merchants with the ability to 
boost profit margins, get better revenue, and implement more advanced merchandising 
due to a right pricing strategy. Another company’s solution is WiseMapper. It is a MAP 
monitoring tool for manufacturers, which helps with pricing protection. Visit the official 
website here: http://goo.gl/tKg5eS.

Ventata is another provider of software for dynamic pricing optimization. Working 
with all major ecommerce platforms, it analyzes historical orders and determines sales 
velocity, curves of supply and demand, and repricing intervals, and it offers past-price 
testing. All of this information is displayed on a convenient control panel, where you can 
mix and match pricing strategies for all of your products. Get more information here:

Boomerang Commerce provides software for real-time data analytics, optimization, 
and machine learning, which brings dynamic price optimization to ecommerce. It tracks 
fixed and variable costs at different levels to measure true profitability of every online 
store. The platform provides rule-based automated price optimization, A/B testing, 
“What-if” analysis, and other useful features within a single dashboard. The official 
website is here: http://goo.gl/nHZpVW.
Conclusion
Congratulations! You’ve just become an advanced ecommerce merchant. Now, you 
know how to turn your CE store into an EE store. Multichannel enterprise is no longer a 
problem. PIM, ERP, CRM, and SAP are much more than just acronyms. You know how 
to sell goods without even seeing them. B2B ecommerce is not an obstacle anymore. 
Dynamic pricing optimization is among your future strategies. And a multivendor 
marketplace is a type of store that you can implement.
What’s the next step in your Magento development? The answer is obvious: custom 
development. In the next chapter, I’ll provide you with insights into the basics of this 
sophisticated topic.

CHAPTER 5
Custom Magento 
Development
You don’t need to become a coder to get involved in custom Magento development. 
While there is always a necessity for making your store more competitive, default 
extensions are no longer helpful, since they are available to everyone. Therefore, if you 
are going to offer a unique customer experience, custom development is a must. In this 
chapter, I explain how to utilize this phenomenon if you are an ecommerce merchant.
Use the power of community: StackExchange, various forums, and open source 
projects are extremely useful if you’ve chosen the path of custom development. You can 
always find something suitable, as the Internet is full of unique solutions and custom 
projects related to the Magento platform. Before hiring developers and reinventing 
the wheel, try to look for existing but unknown solutions. This will prevent you from 
unnecessary expenditures of time and money.
Don’t forget about support offered by extension developers. Since every paid—and 
even some free—extensions usually have a good team of experts behind them, you can 
always contact them to get some help. This often works when problems occur during an 
installation or maintenance, but you can always contact developers to share your ideas 
on customization. You can even ask them to implement certain features before buying a 
product. Such an approach will help you save money and get desired options at a regular 
price.
If these solutions don’t work and you’ve decided to hire a team of developers, I 
recommend checking the following platforms.

Chapter 5 ■ Custom Magento Development
218
Upwork (oDesk)
Upwork, formerly known as oDesk, is a global online work platform for businesses 
and independent professionals. They connect and collaborate remotely through the 
website. As an ecommerce merchant interested in custom Magento development, you

employers to find freelancers for commissioned work worldwide. Founded by Inder 
Guglani, Guru was acquired twice: by Unicru and by eMoonlighter.com. In addition 
to Magento freelancers, the platform lists freelancers from 160 different fields. Use the 
following link to hire Magento developers on Guru: http://goo.gl/lcewCN.
Before hiring someone, check previous reviews and their portfolio. You can even 
offer a test task to see if your future employee is a qualified specialist.
Magento Community Events
If you are a Magento merchant, developer, or marketer, you should be interested in 
attending or at least monitoring core Magento events. We’ve already written about the 
impact of the Real Magento Community on the platform, covering such important topics 
as Hackathon Magento extensions, so now it is time to discuss key Magento community 
events. Next, you will find a list with some useful links.
First, we’d like to draw your attention to the official Magento website. If you do not 
want to miss any Magento gathering, check the official list of events here: Magento Events. 
Currently, there are three pages of various Magento meetings, including MagentoLive 
Australia.
As you will see, almost the entire year is filled with various events. As for the official 
website, you can choose among three categories of events: Industry Events, Magento 
Events, and Partner and Community Events. There is also an archive of past events and a 
Magento Event Listing Request Form.
Meet Magento Events
Leading Magento community events are represented by the Meet Magento Association, 
which provide a great opportunity to get in touch with members of the Real Magento 
Community, including merchants, developers, and agencies. Additionally, you can get 
the latest Magento news and extend your Magento and ecommerce projects during Meet 
Magento.
The first event organized by Meet Magento Association was held in 2008 in Leipzig, 
Germany. Over the last few years, the conference has become a successful international 
event series with events in Europe, America, and Asia. For further information about 
Meet Magento Association and Events, follow this link: Meet Magento1.

Chapter 5 ■ Custom Magento Development
220
Imagine Commerce
Another premier Magento community event is Imagine Commerce. The event gathers 
more than 2,500 experts, including merchants, technology providers, and agencies from 
more than 45 countries. It is a perfect environment for collaborating without borders and 
sharing the power of Real Magento Community.
Developers Paradise
Developers Paradise introduces a great opportunity to communicate with the Magento 
community members and have some fun in the sun. The event gathers more than 1,000 
participants from 30 countries. For further information and registration, hit this link: 
Developers Paradise2.
Magento Unconference
Magento Unconference is a relatively young event, because it was held only once, but it 
is already a promising affair. Get ready for food, preshow, two aftershows, t-shirts, and of 
course ecommerce and Magento.
Mage Titans
If you are a Magento developer, then you should pay a closer attention to Mage Titans 
a conference for Magento developers curated by Magento developers. For further 
information and tickets, follow this link: Mage Titans3.
MagentoLive
MagentoLive brings our favorite ecommerce platform to everyone. All events are hosted 
by the Magento team, so you can get the latest Magento news and ideas as well as share 
you experience with other participants there. The most intriguing feature of MagentoLive 
events is the place where they are held: it must be a state-of-the-art venue. And don’t 
forget about killer parties! More information is available here: MagentoLive4.

Chapter 5 ■ Custom Magento Development
221
MageStackDay
Have you asked questions on magento.stackexchange.com? Then you should attend 
MageStackDay, which is an online hackathon dedicated to answering questions. 
StackExchange itself introduces a great opportunity to find what you are looking for. This 
Magento community event increases your chances to get desired information. Check the 
event here: MageStackDay5.
Conclusion
If someone says you can become a developer and perform everything without other 
specialists successfully running your Magento store at the same time, don’t believe 
them. It will take a lot of time to get necessary experience, so I don’t recommend that 
you choose this path. It is almost impossible to simultaneously be a good ecommerce 
merchant and a top-notch coder, since both require all of your free time and even more.
