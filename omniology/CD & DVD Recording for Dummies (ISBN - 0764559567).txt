About the Author
Mark L. Chambers has been an author, computer consultant, BBS sysop, pro-
grammer, and hardware technician for more than 20 years. (In other words,
he’s been pushing computers and their uses far beyond “normal” performance
limits for decades now.) His first love affair with a computer peripheral blos-
somed in 1984 when he bought his lightning-fast 300 bps modem for his Atari
400. Now he spends entirely too much time on the Internet and drinks far too
much caffeine-laden soda.
His favorite pastimes include collecting gargoyles, watching St. Louis Cardinals
baseball, playing his three pinball machines and the latest computer games,
supercharging computers, and rendering 3-D flights of fancy with TrueSpace —
and during all that, he listens to just about every type of music imaginable.
(For those of his readers who are keeping track, he has over 1,200 audio CDs
in his collection.)
With a degree in journalism and creative writing from Louisiana State
University, Mark took the logical career choice and started programming
computers. However, after five years as a COBOL programmer for a hospital
system, he decided that there must be a better way to earn a living, and he
became the Documentation Manager for Datastorm Technologies, a well-
known communications software developer. Somewhere in between organiz-
ing and writing software manuals, Mark began writing computer books; his
first book, Running a Perfect BBS, was published in 1994.
Along with writing several books a year and editing whatever his publishers
throw at him, Mark has recently branched out into Web-based education,
designing and teaching a number of online classes — called WebClinics —
for Hewlett-Packard.
Mark’s rapidly-expanding list of books includes Building a PC For Dummies,
Scanners For Dummies, CD and DVD Recording For Dummies, Mac OS X
Panther All-In-One Desk Reference For Dummies, PC All-In-One Desk Reference
For Dummies, Mac OS X Panther: Top 100 Simplified Tips & Tricks, Microsoft
Office v. X Power User’s Guide, BURN IT! Creating Your Own Great DVDs and
CDs, The Hewlett-Packard Official Printer Handbook, The Hewlett-Packard
Official Recordable CD Handbook, The Hewlett-Packard Official Digital
Photography Handbook, Computer Gamer’s Bible, Recordable CD Bible, Teach
Yourself the iMac Visually, Running a Perfect BBS, Official Netscape Guide to
Web Animation, and the Windows 98 Troubleshooting and Optimizing Little
Black Book.

His books have been translated into 12 different languages so far — his
favorites are German, Polish, Dutch, and French. Although he can’t read
them, he enjoys the pictures a great deal.
Mark welcomes all comments and questions about his books — you can

Author’s Acknowledgments
In this, my fourth book on CD and DVD recording, I find that I’m again in debt
to a number of great people at Wiley Publishing. I’m noticing a pattern here,
and I must say I like it!
As with all my books, I’d like to first thank my wife, Anne, and my children,
Erin, Chelsea, and Rose, for their support and love — and for letting me
follow my dream!
No book would see the light of day without the Production team, this time
led by project coordinator Adrienne Martinez — starting with my words and
adding a tremendous amount of work, they’ve once again taken care of art-
work, proofreading, and countless steps that I can’t fathom. Thanks to each
of the team members for a beautiful book.
Next, my appreciation goes to my editorial manager, Kevin Kirschner, and to
my technical editor, Trevor Kay, who checked the technical accuracy of every
word — including that baker’s dozen of absurd acronyms that crops up in
every computer book I’ve ever written. Their work ensures that my work is
the best it can be!
Finally, we come to the Big Two who have worked on this project since the
beginning. I promised Bob Woerner, my acquisitions editor, the fewest number
of gray hairs possible: I hope that I succeeded! Despite what many folks think,
For Dummies titles don’t grow on trees. He was instrumental in launching this
one. And this great title was guided by my latest project editor, Nicole Sholly,
who checked the grammar and clarity of every word. This is my first book
with Nicole in charge, and I very much hope it won’t be the last. My heartfelt
thanks to you both for another chance to put pen to paper — well, actually,
fingers to keyboard!

1997 — it was called Recordable CD Bible, and I’m proud to say that it
was one of the first consumer books on the shelves that covered all aspects of
the art. Yes, in those days, CD burning was indeed an art form! Recording soft-
ware was still expensive and hard to handle, with no wizards to guide you.
Drives were ten times as expensive as they are now . . . and I’m talking about
CD-R recorders only, because rewriteable CDs and DVDs didn’t exist yet. It was
all too easy to ruin a recording and burn a shiny, useless drink coaster. In fact,
most computers literally weren’t fast enough to deliver data to a recorder at
the rate it demanded — I can vividly remember telling readers to drop their
recording speed to 1X in many situations to avoid recording errors!
Everything has changed in the new millennium. Most PCs and Macs come with
a recorder built-in, or you can buy one for pocket change. Recording formats,
like UDF/packet-writing, and new hardware advances, like burnproofing, allow
just about any PC to burn a disc without errors — not to mention that record-
ing software has been refined to the point that it’s virtually foolproof. (If all this
sounds like I’m speaking in a foreign language, fear not: I cover it completely in
the chapters to follow!)
If things are so easy and foolproof today, why did I decide to write a new For
Dummies book about CD and DVD recording? Because the challenge is still
there! It has just shifted from “the art of successfully recording anything” to
“the art of using your recorder to its full potential.” Today, a CD or DVD
recorder can produce everything from superb-sounding audio CDs to DVD-
Video discs that you can play in your home DVD player. More applications
than ever are available for your recorded discs: digital photo albums, system
backups, MP3 music discs, mixed data and audio CDs, and much, much more.
I’ve written this book to introduce you to the entire range of discs that you
can produce and how to create each of them like an experienced expert.
Also, the road to perfect recording still isn’t perfectly flat. For example, if
you’re buying and installing a drive, you need all the information you can get.
I give you an entire glossary full of terms, formats, and crazy acronyms that
you need to understand. (Go ahead — flip to the back of this book and check
it out!) Just because your recording software doesn’t display all those config-
uration settings on the main menu any more doesn’t mean that they’re not
there, and sooner or later, you need to know what all those settings do.
That’s the reason I wrote this book: It’s for readers who want to know every-
thing about recording, from top to bottom! As in my other For Dummies books,
I begin with the basics and lead you into advanced recording, with needed tips

and tricks added along the way. I promise to stick to the English language, so
you don’t need an engineer or a computer programmer handy to decode any-
thing. Like any For Dummies author, I get to be myself and use my sense of
humor. This book is not your typical dry, dreary computer manual — I hope
that this book is entertaining enough to read in the bathtub! (Just be careful
not to drop it.)
What’s Really Required
Forget the engineering degree and keep your wallet in your pocket (unless
you haven’t bought this book yet — if you haven’t, please proceed to the
cashier and support a computer-book author). I find that many folks have
preconceived notions of what’s needed to burn a great CD or DVD, so this
gives me an opportunity to set things right. To wit, these are the require-
ments that you don’t need for this book:
U A decade of experience with computers, recording, hardware, or even
software.
U An entire bank account to spend on expensive software. Most software
that I describe in this book either came with your recorder or can be
bought as shareware for a few bucks — and some applications I cover
are free for the asking!
U The latest drive on the market. If you’ve scavenged an older drive at a
garage sale or eBay, you’re in good hands. I cover information, tips, and
tricks that apply to older drives and their idiosyncrasies.
If you haven’t bought your CD or DVD recorder yet, this book will become
your trusted friend in a hurry! I cover each of the features that you should
consider, plus how to install and configure your new toy.
About This Book
Each self-contained chapter in this book covers a specific topic relating to
your recorder. Although you can begin reading anywhere or skip chapters at
will (for example, if you’ve already installed your drive, you don’t need that
chapter), but I think that reading from front to back makes the most sense —
it’s the whole linear-order thing, you know.
I’ve also included a glossary of all the computer and recording terms that I
cover in the text, as well as an appendix with contact information for manu-
facturers of recorders and software.

Conventions Used in This Book
Like any other computer book, I have to ask that you type commands and
click menu items from time to time. Luckily, For Dummies books have a set of
conventions that can help keep things clear.
Stuff you type
If you have to type a command within Windows or the Mac operating system,
the text appears like this:
Type me
Press the Enter (or Return) key to process the command.
Menu commands
Menu commands you should use appear in the following format:
Choose Edit➪Copy
For example, this shorthand indicates that you should click the Edit menu
and then click the Copy menu item.
Display messages
Whenever I talk about messages that you should see displayed on-screen, those
messages look like this: This is a message displayed by a program.
In case you’re curious about computers
I try to steer clear about much of what goes on underneath the suave exterior
of your recorder — after all, computers are supposed to be getting easier to
use, not harder. If you’re like me, however, you sometimes like to know what
makes something tick. Occasionally, you see sidebars that provide a little
more technical background about what I’m discussing. Feel free to read these
technical sidebars (or gleefully ignore them because I don’t give you tests on
this material afterward).

Introduction

How This Book Is Organized
My editors demanded that I organize this book somehow — and because they
have this contract thing I had to sign, I’ve divided the book into six major
parts, with cross-references where appropriate. The book also has an index
that you can use to locate a specific topic.
The six parts are described in this section.
Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder!
This part familiarizes you with your CD or DVD recorder. You find out how
both types of optical media work, what to look for (and what to avoid) when
shopping for a new recorder, and what you can do with DVD technology. I
also have you installing your drive like a professional, even if you’ve never
opened your computer’s case before.
Part II: It’s All in the Preparation
In this part, I discuss the preparations that you should take before you burn
your first disc. I show you how to optimize your computer’s performance,
how to select the right recording software for the job, and how to select the
right configuration settings for the type of disc that you want to record (set-
tings like the format, the organization, and the file system).
Part III: Hang On — Here We Go!
Here’s where things get really good — you advance to recording typical audio
CDs and data discs with Easy CD & DVD Creator 6 (for the PC) and Toast 6
Titanium (for the Mac). These audio and data discs are the bread and butter
of most home recording projects, and you find out to burn them by following
step-by-step examples. I also show you how to use Drag-to-Disc, a program
that can deliver effortless recording by using the drag-and-drop convenience
of Windows.
Part IV: So You’re Ready to 
Tackle Tougher Stuff?
I cover the advanced ground in this part as I show you how to create Video
CDs, photo CDs, and DVD projects. I also demonstrate how to transfer your
4
CD & DVD Recording For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

music from albums and cassettes to audio CDs. For that professional appear-
ance, I show you how to print custom disc labels and box inserts, and I help
you create a custom HTML menu system to spruce up your data CDs.
Part V: The Part of Tens
If you’re a devoted fan of the For Dummies series, you should immediately
recognize these four chapters — they provide tips and advice on recording,
including troubleshooting tips, and software recommendations. Oh, and I
also include my traditional chapter on Ten Things to Avoid Like the Plague —
not to be missed!
Part VI: Appendixes
Here you can find a list of hardware and software manufacturers and a glossary
of computer terms and unwieldy acronyms.
Icons Used in This Book
Consider the icons in this book as signposts pointing at particularly important
stuff.
Whenever you see the Tip icon, it’s sure to be accompanied by information
that saves you time, trouble, or cash.
Look to the handsome sign of the Scavenger for information on buying or
using an older recorder, as well as tips on using older hardware in general.
Like the sidebars in this book, the Technical Stuff icon indicates material that
is entirely optional: It’s for folks with computer curiosity.
Like a roadside warning sign, potential trouble is ahead. Always read the infor-
mation next to this icon first to avoid damage to your hardware and software!
5
Introduction

This information is the stuff that you would see in the CliffsNotes version of
this book. It’s highlighter material that reminds you of something important.
Because you’re currently reading the Second Edition of this technological
tome, you can expect updated descriptions and information on brand-new
hardware and software . . . hence this attractive icon.
Where to Go from Here
I recommend that you read this book in linear order, but where you start
depends on your knowledge (and whether you already have your recorder).
To wit:
U If you’re shopping for a recorder or you have yet to install your hard-
ware, start with Part I. (That’s also a good place to start if you’re curious
about how CD and DVD technology works.)
U If your recorder is already working, but you need help burning discs,
start with Part II.
U In any other case, use the index, or jump straight to the chapter that
holds the information you need. (Don’t forget to check out the other
chapters when you have time!)
I wish you the best of luck with your recording projects, and I hope that you
find this book valuable. Be prepared to keep a spindle of 50 blank discs next
to your computer!

Your Recorder!

In this part . . .
T
his part familiarizes you with your CD or DVD recorder.
I go over reading to and saving from a disc and cover
the differences between CDs and DVDs. You ﬁnd out how
these wonderful optical media work, what to look for (and
what to avoid) when shopping for a new recorder, and what
you can do with DVD technology. By the end of this part, I
have you installing your drive like a professional (taped-up
nerd glasses not necessarily included) even if you’ve never
opened your computer’s case before.

W
hen’s the last time you really looked at a CD? I mean really stared at it,
in rapt fascination? Believe it or not, CDs used to be enthralling!
CDs and DVDs are now both staples of the technical wonderland that you and
I live in. Unless you’re older and you were around long before 1980 — the
days of disco, Charlie’s Angels, and Rubik’s Cube — you won’t remember the
lure of the compact disc. In those dark times, before the introduction of CDs,
music lived on huge, clunky vinyl albums. Computer software was loaded on
floppy disks. Movies? They were kept on videotapes. (Remember those?)
At first, this situation wasn’t a bad one — at least until you kept these old-
fashioned storage media for a year or two. Suddenly, you would find that
those records had picked up scratches and pops. Computer programs were
growing so large that they would span five or six floppies. And sooner or
later, those floppy disks and movie videotapes could no longer be read reli-
ably; after a mere 100 viewings or so, you would end up buying another VHS
copy of Enter the Dragon. (Okay, so I’m a big Bruce Lee fan. Substitute your
favorite movie instead.)
Like a circular knight in shining armor, the arrival of the CD heralded the begin-
ning of the digital consumer age. I’m not kidding; I can remember an entire room
of technotypes jumping with excitement just to see their first compact disc!
(None of us could afford an audio CD player, and computer CD-ROM drives
hadn’t arrived yet, but it was great just to see a real CD.) In the beginning, audio

CDs brought us crystal-clear sound and the convenience of jumping instantly
from track to track. Then, computer software suddenly fit on one CD, and the
software could always be read reliably. With the advent of DVD, widescreen
movies are accompanied by luxuries like alternative soundtracks and interviews
with the cast and director. Would you go back to anything less?
In this chapter, I introduce you to the basics of compact disc and DVD stor-
age: You don’t have to know all this stuff before you jump into recording your
own discs, but if you understand the basics of what’s going on, you avoid
mistakes. (Always be prepared.) I promise to tell you along the way about
what you absolutely need to know. You find out how discs store information,
video, and music as well as what’s inside your CD or DVD recorder. I cover
what types of media you can use and what you can store. Finally, I show you
how to properly care for your optical pets. (You may not stare wistfully at
CDs like I used to, but you still have to keep them clean.)
Always Begin with a Definition
In this case, let me start by defining the now-familiar term CD-ROM — short
for compact disc read-only memory. (I’ve shortened this to CD throughout this
book, which will save about 200 trees by the time I’ve finished.) This high
tech description simply means that a CD stores information of some sort that
your computer or audio CD player can read but can’t write to (which makes
the CD-ROM drive different from a hard drive, for example, which you can
both read from and write to). In general, I use the word disc to describe both
CD-ROMs and DVD-ROMs; they’re both similar, read-only, and look very much
alike.
Keep this in mind: Whenever folks refer to just a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive
(without using the word recordable), they’re talking about the drives that just
read discs and can’t record them.
10
Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder! 
Dig that crazy acronym!
I have to use a truckload of acronyms in this
book. Luckily, each one has only one meaning,
right? Almost! One strange exception applies:
You may be wondering what DVD stands for,
and as the mondo author expert, I should be
able to tell you.
When DVD-ROM technology was first intro-
duced, everyone agreed that it stood for digital
versatile disc read-only memory because it could
store so many types of data. Although a CD can
store music and computer files, it doesn’t have
the room for a full-length movie at the highest-
quality level. DVD-ROM was the first optical
media to hold all the different types of digital
information we use today: lots and lots of data,
an entire movie, or even super-high quality
audio. Hence, the word versatile, and every-
one seemed happy. (You find out how to cram

The basic specifications of both audio CDs and data CDs (those discs you 
use in your computer) are the same; they’re 12 centimeters in diameter and a 
millimeter thick, and they have an opaque top and a reflective bottom. Such
is the Tao of the disc.
As you can see in Figure 1-1, however, the structure of a mass-produced disc
isn’t a single piece of plastic. It’s made up of a number of layers, each of
which has something special to add to the mix:
 A label: Commercially manufactured discs you buy in the store have
screen-printed labels; these graphics are created from layers of ink
applied one on top of the other (like that Metallica T-shirt you may be
wearing).
What’s that, you say? You don’t have $2,000 or so to spend on a special
CD screen printer? (Come to think of it, neither do I!) In that case, do
what I do and use your inkjet or laser printer to create a fancy paper
label, complete with the graphics and text you choose (more on this
topic in Chapter 14).
“Do I really need a label?” To be honest, no. A disc you’ve recorded
works fine without one. However, if you’ve ever dug through a 6-inch
stack of unlabeled CDs to find that Andy Williams Greatest Hits disc you
burned a month ago for Aunt Harriet, I guarantee that you will under-
stand. If you don’t need a professional look and you’re not into appear-
ances, just use a CD-marking pen and scribble a quick title on top. Most
recordable discs have blank lines printed on them for just this purpose.

Chapter 1: Optical Storage: It’s All in the Pits
huge amounts of stuff on a DVD-ROM in the
section “Ready for stardom: DVD-R/W” later in
this chapter.)
At some point, however, those first owners of
DVD-ROM players who weren’t acronym 
aficionados decided that DVD stood for digital
video disc — and for a time that was true
because DVDs were first used for only movies.
This name situation leaves us in a quandary
because more and more folks think video
rather than versatile. Naturally, it doesn’t
matter a hoot because everyone just uses the
acronym anyway, but it does make a killer trivia
question!

You can pick up one of these handy pens at any office supply store, but
make sure that you buy a pen designed especially for marking CDs.
 Opaque plastic: You need something to protect the top of the disc. I sup-
pose that you could use steel, but then a disc would weigh two pounds
and cost much more. Therefore, the manufacturer adds a layer of
scratch-resistant plastic.
 Aluminum film: Mass-produced CDs use a thin layer of aluminum that’s
covered with microscopic indentations called pits. These pits are
arranged in a single, tiny groove that spirals around the disc, just like
the groove on one of those antique record albums. (If something works,
why mess with it?) However, the groove on a CD starts at the center and
spirals to the outside of the disc, so it goes in the opposite direction.
 More plastic: Again, all that shiny aluminum has to be protected — how-
ever, in this case, the plastic must be crystal-clear (for reasons that soon
become apparent), so the manufacturer adds another layer. Here’s a hint
about why this layer is clear: It has to do with the passage of laser light.
As I mention earlier in this chapter, this yummy sandwich is a cross-section
of a commercial CD produced at a factory — the discs you record are differ-
ent in one important way, which I cover in a minute.
DVDs are similar to CDs in construction, but, as I remind you from time to time,
commercially produced DVDs can be double-sided (so you can flip them to
watch the second half of a really long film, like Das Boot or Gone with the Wind).
Therefore, they may not always have a label side, in which case the sides are
marked around the spindle hole.
How Is Data Recorded on CDs and DVDs?
Consider just how audio, video, and computer files are stored on CDs and
DVDs. Although these three types of information are different, they’re stored
in the same way: digitally. But what does that word really mean?
Programmers, technotypes, and hardware jockeys use the word digital when
they’re talking about binary, the language used by computers around the
world. Unlike the imprecise languages spoken and written by mere humans,
binary data is built from only two values — 0 (zero) and 1, which are often
referred to as Off and On, respectively shown in Figure 1-2. (In fact, a com-
puter is only a huge collection of switches, but that’s another story.)
Therefore, computer files, movies, and digital music are long lines of 0s
(zeros) and 1s. If you sat next to a light switch for 100 years and flipped it off
and on in the proper sequence, you would have the visual version of a digital
song from a CD (and a bad headache along with incredibly sore fingers).
12
Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder! 

Now that you’re privy to the binary master plan, you can see how the absence
and presence of light perfectly represents binary data — a room is either dark
or bright. The geniuses who developed CD and DVD technology took this con-
cept one step further! They had the great idea of using a laser beam to read
the binary data stored on a disc, and that’s where those pits in the aluminum
layer that I mention in the preceding section take center stage.
Figure 1-3 shows how the binary data is read: When the laser beam hits a pit
on the surface of the disc, the beam scatters, so most of it isn’t reflected back:
hence, darkness, which in this case stands for a 0 (zero) in binary data. If the
laser beam hits one of the flat surfaces — they’re called lands, by the way —
the beam is reflected cleanly back, and the drive senses that reflected light.
(Think of a 1 in binary.) And, ladies and gentlemen, that is why the business
end of a disc shines like a mirror; the rainbow effect is caused by the micro-
scopic groove that runs across the surface. Naturally, this process happens
very fast (I talk about speed in Chapter 2), but that’s really all there is to it.
Essentially, DVD technology works the same way — with a difference or two. A
DVD-ROM can hold the approximate equivalent of seven CDs, and Figure 1-4

13
Chapter 1: Optical Storage: It’s All in the Pits

shows how: The pits on a DVD-ROM are much smaller and are packed closer
together on the surface of the disc, and the drive uses a much more powerful
laser beam to read them. DVD can also have multiple reflective layers. (That’s
the reason that data can be stored on both sides.)
Believe it or not, the DVD specification standard provides for double-sided
DVD-ROM discs that have two layers on each side, for more than 27 CDs’
worth of storage space on a single DVD-ROM! However, these discs are so
hard to manufacture that they’re on the endangered species list, and I’ve
never actually seen one.
It’s All in the Dye
Consider the structure of recordable discs, which includes both recordable
CDs and recordable DVDs. Remember the aluminum film that I mention in the
section “Always Begin with a Definition” earlier in this chapter? Sounds per-
manent, doesn’t it? Indeed it is, which is why you can’t use commercially

Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder! 

manufactured discs to record your own data; your recorder has to be able to
create the equivalent of pits and lands in some other way. (Not even Bill
Gates has a CD-R manufacturing plant in his house.)
Figure 1-5 shows the answer as well as a really bad pun. The CD-R (short for
compact disc recordable), which can be recorded once, uses a layer of green
or blue reactive dye under a smooth reflective surface of either aluminum or
gold. The groove is still there, but until the disc has been recorded, the disc
is perfectly empty. This dye permanently melts or darkens when hit by a
laser beam of a certain frequency, which results in a pit. (As you find out later
in the chapter, a number of DVD recordable formats are currently on the
market, but things work the same.)
“Hang on, Mark — wouldn’t the beam from my regular read-only CD-ROM or
DVD-ROM drive cause problems?” Good question, but the designers of
recordable CD and DVD drives have you covered. The laser beam that is used
to read a disc is far less powerful than the beam used to record one. Therefore,
when the beam from the laser in your CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive hits one of
these dark spots, the beam is swallowed like an apple pie at a state fair, so it
acts just like a pit in a mass-produced CD. In fact, your read-only drive is com-
pletely fooled . . . it can’t tell the difference.

Chapter 1: Optical Storage: It’s All in the Pits
Why all the different colors?
I get asked this question all the time. Some CD-
Rs, DVD-Rs, and DVD+Rs are gold with a green
dye, and others are silver with a blue or purple
dye. Everything acts the same: You’re just look-
ing at two different recipes for the dye used by
different manufacturers. Most drives record on
either type of disc, but in rare situations, an
older drive seems to work better with one or the
other color combination. Personally, I think that
it has something to do with the alignment of the
planets and the phase of the moon, but I must
report what I hear.
On the other hand, CD-RWs and rewriteable
DVDs use the same type of crystalline layer, so
they’re all colored the same.

The inside of your CD or DVD recorder sounds like it’s getting a little crowded
with all these different laser beams, but it’s really not. A recorder has a beam
that can be set at two levels: a lower power setting that can read a disc and a
higher setting to record it. Slick, eh?
A CD-RW, which is short for compact disc rewriteable, is another story. (Get
ready: You’re going to love this description. It honestly sounds like something
out of Star Trek — the original series, not any of those later failures that don’t
have Captain Kirk.) Here goes: Both rewriteable CDs and DVDs use a “phase
change recording process” using a “crystalline layer with amorphous proper-
ties” rather than a dye layer. Didn’t I tell you? It sounds like something Spock
would say! You can promptly forget that stuff because nobody but an engi-
neer cares, and no one gives a test afterward.
Anyway, although the crystalline layer starts out clear, the correct type of
laser beam can change it to opaque, creating — you guessed it — a pit. When
you’re ready to erase the disk, that same beam of laser light resets the crys-
talline layer to clear again, and you’re ready to record all over again. Talk
about recycling!
Behind the Curtain: Inside 
CD-RW and DVD Drives
Before I delve into the depths of your hardware, I want to make one thing per-
fectly clear: You do not have to read this section! In fact, if raising the hood on
your car and just looking at the engine gives you a headache, I encourage you
to skip this section entirely. It’s definitely not necessary to know what makes
your drive tick.
Still here? I didn’t scare you away? Good! If you’re like me, and cool machinery
like your recorder fascinates you, stick with me and read on! In this section, I
show you the interior guts of your CD-RW or DVD recorder.
The motor
Because pits are arranged around the entire disc, something has to turn it —
in this case, an efficient, high-speed electric motor. (No coal or gas here,
Bucko.) The motor turns a spindle, which holds the disc by the hole in the
center — yet another similarity to vinyl record albums!
16
Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder! 

The laser stuff
A CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive has a laser read head, and a recorder has a
read head that can be set to variable power levels. When you read a disc, the
laser beam is focused through a lens upward toward the surface of the disc; if
the beam is reflected by a land, the light travels through a prism to an optical
pickup. In turn, the pickup yells to your computer (in effect) “Hey, I just
passed a land back there, so add a 1 to the file.”
When a drive is recording, the laser beam is switched to its higher power; the
beam simply travels up to the surface of the disc and creates a pit by discol-
oring or melting the dye layer in one tiny spot.
How does the laser get around the entire surface of the disc? It’s on a moving
track that can move forward and back between the center and outside edge
of the disc.
The tray
The tray is self-explanatory but still pretty doggone important: You need some
method of inserting and ejecting discs. Although most drives use a tray that
extends to hold the disc, some integrated CD-RW and DVD drives use a slot with
a motor-loading system that draws the disc inside the drive (just like a car audio
CD player). Older drives used a thin plastic box called a caddy — you opened
the caddy and stuck the disc inside. Although you would be hard pressed to
find a new CD-RW recorder that uses a caddy, some high-capacity DVD-RAM
recorders now use them to help protect the disc. (More on DVD-RAM in the
section titled “The rewriteable warehouse: DVD-RAM” later in this chapter.)
The controls
Your recorder is certain to have an eject button and probably also a head-
phone jack and volume control for listening to audio CDs. More expensive
drives can go a step further with more audio CD controls, like Pause, Play,
Next Track, and Previous Track.
The emergency hole
I know that it sounds weird, but every drive has an emergency disc eject hole.
Think of it as being similar to the ejection seat in a jet fighter plane or one of
those cool emergency airlock controls that crops up in every science fiction
17
Chapter 1: Optical Storage: It’s All in the Pits

horror movie. (How many times has Sigourney Weaver blasted something
nasty into space by slapping a button?) You can use this microscopic hole on
the front of your drive to forcibly eject a disc whenever your drive has locked
up or if a disc is caught inside. To use the emergency eject, push the end of a
paper clip or a piece of stiff wire into this hole. This technique usually works
even when there’s no power to the drive.
Love Those Discs: CD-R, CD-R/W, DVD-
R/W, DVD+R/W, and DVD-RAM
If you’ve been reading this chapter at a single sitting, you may have a media-
induced headache by now. No, I’m not talking about the nightly TV news — 
I mean all those different kinds of discs I mention from time to time in this
chapter. You may have read a little about CD-R and CD-RW in this chapter, but
it’s high time that I identify each of the five types and fill in all the details.
This section does just that.
“Hey, can’t I buy just one drive?”
Yes. In fact, I’ve installed an all-format Sony drive in my Batcomputer; the
drive can handle everything in that list except DVD-RAM. (Ah, there’s the
rub.) If you’re already the proud owner of a CD-RW drive, I can assure you
that it can’t be upgraded to record DVDs — on the flip side, any DVD
recorder can record CD-Rs and CD-RWs. (Hence their growing popularity.
Versatility is always A Good Thing.)
You’ll often see kindred write-once and rewriteable formats grouped together
as a single name: For example, CD-R/W actually stands for CD-R and CD-RW.
(Remember, a CD-RW drive can also record CD-Rs.) Likewise, DVD-R/W stands
for DVD-R and DVD-RW, and — you guessed it — DVD+R/W includes both
DVD+R and DVD+RW.
First on the block: CD-R
In the beginning, there was the CD-R, and it’s still by far the most popular
media on the market. A typical CD-R can store anywhere from 650 to 700MB
(megabytes) of computer data or 74 to 80 minutes of audio. (The higher num-
bers are for higher-capacity, 80-minute CD-Rs.) You can also stack more stuff
on a CD-R by using the overburning feature; read more on this rather nasty-
sounding feature in Chapter 2. As I mention earlier in this chapter, after
you’ve filled a CD-R to capacity, there’s no turning back; the data is perma-
nently recorded and can’t be erased.
18
Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder! 

Other sizes of CDs are indeed available — for example, discs with a diameter
of 8 centimeters that can hold 184MB — but they’re so specialized that you
and I can safely ignore them. Some higher-capacity CD-Rs that can hold more
than 700MB have hit the market, too, but they’re not compatible with older
CD-RW drives.
Time for the first Mark’s Maxim for this book:
If you need compatibility, think CD-R.™
Take heed: Any CD-ROM drive — no matter how old — can read CD-Rs, and
they’re the only discs that are guaranteed to play in any home or car audio
CD player. In other words, use CD-R whenever
 You’re recording a disc to send to someone else.
 You’re recording an audio CD for playing on anything other than your
recorder.
 You’re not sure whether a drive reads a CD-RW.
Reusable and loving it: CD-RW
The CD-RW is the most common rewriteable media on the market right now.
It can store 650MB (74 minutes) of audio. A CD-RW must be formatted before
you use it, just like a floppy disk or your hard drive; most discs come prefor-
matted from the manufacturer. You also have to reformat the disc if you want
to erase its contents.
Did you read about the amorphous crystalline stuff I mention earlier in this
chapter? On the positive side, that’s what allows your CD-RW drive to erase
the disc and use it again. On the downside, however, most read-only CD-ROM
drives that are older than three or four years old can’t read a CD-RW disc,
and a CD-RW can’t be used in older audio CD players. Use CD-RW whenever
 You’re recording a disc for use on your computer, like a backup.
 You’re sure that another CD-ROM drive (or audio CD player) can read a
CD-RW.
How can you tell whether a CD-ROM drive can read CD-RWs? Many manufac-
turers add a MultiRead symbol to their faceplates; if you’re still unsure, try
reading a recorded CD-RW in the drive (don’t worry — you won’t hurt the
hardware). If you can load files from the CD-RW, you have a MultiRead drive.
An audio CD player that supports CD-RW is likely to announce the fact in its
documentation or specifications.

Chapter 1: Optical Storage: It’s All in the Pits

Ready for stardom: DVD-R/W
Perhaps I shouldn’t say “ready for stardom” — heck, in the video world, the
DVD-ROM has already overtaken the traditional VHS tape. (I don’t suppose that
makes Betamax VCR owners feel any better, but every dog has his day.) DVD-
ROM is also poised to take over the reign of CD as the media of choice for virtu-
ally every new computer on the planet. But what about recordable DVD?
Unfortunately, things are still a little tenuous in the world of recordable DVD
standards. However, two format standards are now in use and are (in my
opinion) destined to win any turf battles. Luckily, they correspond pretty
closely to the world of recordable CDs.
The first of these standards is the DVD-R, which is short for — you guessed 
it — DVD recordable. Like your old friend the CD-R, a DVD-R can be recorded
only once. However, the DVD-R can hold a whopping 4.7GB (that’s gigabytes,
friends and neighbors) per side of the disc, for a total of 9.4GB of data on a
double-sided disc. DVD-R is the darling of the video-editing crowd because 
it allows you to record a disc that can be used in a standard DVD player.
Naturally, the DVDs you create with a DVD-R drive can’t be read on a stan-
dard CD-ROM drive (but you can burn regular CD-Rs and CD-RWs).
On the rewriteable side, the standard is called DVD-RW. (Note the dash there;
it becomes pretty important in a page or two.) These discs can also store
4.7GB, and you format them very much like a CD-RW. Any DVD-ROM drive
should be able to read a DVD-RW. Unfortunately, not all DVD players can read
DVD-RWs, so if you’re an up-and-coming Hollywood type that’s interested in
producing your own movie discs, you should stick with the DVD-R standard
(which is compatible with all DVD players).
Oh joy, what confusion: DVD+R/W
Okay, here’s where everything gets a little hairy. No, that plus sign isn’t a typo:
Two other completely independent DVD standards, DVD+R and DVD+RW, are
available as well. These two more recent formats are being touted by an
entirely different group of computer hardware manufacturers. (I suppose that
they needed different names — but couldn’t they have chosen something
easier to remember? Whatever happened to the guy who chose the name
Microsoft Bob for an operating system? By the way, I still have my copy.)
Anyway, DVD+Rs and DVD+RWs can store 4.7GB, and a DVD-ROM player can
read both types of discs. Again, however, you run into the same problem —
DVD+Rs are compatible with most DVD players, but DVD+RWs aren’t widely
supported by DVD players. Plus, DVD-R/W and DVD+R/W are incompatible.
(Insert sound of my hand slapping my forehead here.)
20
Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder! 

In fact, these two disc formats are roughly equivalent — DVD+R/Ws are
cheaper to manufacture, though, so they may eventually get the nod. (Of
course, if you buy an all-format drive like mine, you don’t really give a darn
about that plus or minus. I can record both DVD-R/W and DVD+R/W, smiling
quietly to myself all the while.)
If your DVD recorder is limited to one format or the other, take care when
you’re buying DVD media! Make doggone sure that you remember which type
of discs your recorder can burn — you’ll be deluged by the choices on store
shelves, and it’s easy to mistake DVD-R for DVD+R if you’re not careful. (Some
readers have told me they’re considering a tattoo to help them keep things
straight.)
The rewriteable warehouse: DVD-RAM
Finally, there’s good old DVD-RAM — a rewriteable disc that can store as much
as 9.4GB of data by using both sides. (Remember, a double-sided DVD doesn’t
have a standard label; printing can appear only around the spindle hole.)
DVD-RAM is well-established, and there’s no “plus” format competing for fame
and fortune. DVD-RAM is a great option for storing those huge digital video
files, and because DVD-RAMs are reusable, I find them the best media for back-
ing up my hard drives. Note, however, that most DVD-ROM players can’t read a
DVD-RAMs, so use one of the other DVD formats if you’re recording something
to distribute to others.
What’s Wrong with Tapes, Disks, 
and Removable Media?
Nothing, really! It’s just that they’re antique technologies compared with
rewriteable CDs and DVDs. In this section, I list the most important reasons
that optical beats magnetic hands-down.
Here I go, continuing my own personal crusade against the Great Pretender:
the archaic floppy disk. I strongly recommend that you never keep any data of
value stored exclusively on floppy disks! They are the most unreliable media
on the planet — they’re easily demagnetized, they don’t hold much, and they
often can’t be read by other computers.
21
Chapter 1: Optical Storage: It’s All in the Pits

More reliable
First (and to many folks, most important), a rewriteable CD or DVD provides
permanent storage with a high degree of reliability. Unlike magnetic media —
including tape cartridges, floppy disks, and even Zip disks and hard drives —
a CD or DVD doesn’t stretch or demagnetize. As long as you keep your discs
clean, reasonably cool, and free from scratches, you should be able to read
them without error for a century or more. (I don’t know about you, but I
don’t know just how important my tax returns will be in 100 years; then
again, I want my priceless family photographs to last as long as possible!)
Discs have no moving parts to wear out, and they don’t rust.
Higher capacity
Forget about storing 700MB of data on a floppy disk! Even the latest Zip disks
are simply no match for the 9.4GB capacity of a double-sided DVD-RAM. All
that room comes in handy for backing up your system’s hard drive, too.
Cheaper
Have you priced a stack of 50 blank, 700MB CD-Rs these days? At the time I
wrote this book, I could find that 50-pack all over the Internet at $15; a 50-
pack of 650MB CD-RWs is about $30. DVD-RAM prices are hovering around
$15 for a 9.4GB disc, and 4.7GB DVD-Rs are selling for about $35 for a 50-pack.
As you can imagine, the lower the cost per megabyte for a storage method, the
better, and no other type of media can beat recordable CDs and DVDs. And, if
the current trend continues, prices will just drop lower. Ain’t life grand?
Faster and more convenient
If you’ve ever waited for a tape to rewind or a floppy disk to load, you’ve
wished for a faster method of loading your stuff — CDs and DVDs feature fast
access time, and there’s no rewinding. To put it another way, even if something
did fit in the tight space of a floppy disk, would you want to run that program
from that floppy? Unlike tape drives — which must move linearly from one sec-
tion of tape to another — you can jump directly from one part of a disc to
another instantly. Take my word for it, this speedy delivery makes restoring
files from a backup much faster!
22
Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder! 

Compatibility
Virtually every PC that’s still running these days has a CD-ROM drive, so com-
patibility is a big advantage to recordable CD for folks like software develop-
ers, network administrators, and your Uncle Milton. To put it another way:
Ever tried to stick a Zip disk into your car audio player? ’Nuff said.
“What Do I Need in Order to Record?”
You knew that there would be a catch, didn’t you? You’re probably thinking,
“I bet that I have to have a $1,000 software program and a cutting-edge com-
puter to record discs.” Not true, good reader, not true! It used to be that way
when I wrote my first book on CD recording (Recordable CD Bible, written in
the ancient mid-1990s), but CD and DVD recorders are now tame and lovable
creatures. They ask for only the basics — in fact, if your computer came with
a CD or DVD recorder already installed, you can skip this section because
you’re likely to have everything you need.
What you need for Windows
Here’s a list of the basic minimum requirements you need for DVD recording
on a PC running Windows 2000 or Windows XP:
 A Pentium III PC (or better): You need at least 64MB of memory and
1GB of free hard drive space (for a CD recorder). If you’re recording
DVDs, you need up to 6GB free.
 A CD or DVD recorder: Naturally, you also need the proper connection.
Internal recorders use Enhanced Integrated Drive Electronics (EIDE) or
Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) connections. External recorders
can use SCSI, Universal Serial Bus (USB), or FireWire connections. If
you’re using an external drive, it should come with the necessary cables
you need.
 Recording software: Most recorders come bundled with some sort of
software; if your computer already has a recorder, it probably also came
with the programs you need to burn your discs.
 Blank media: Naturally.
23
Chapter 1: Optical Storage: It’s All in the Pits

What you need for the Macintosh
Here’s a list of the basic minimum recording requirements for a Macintosh
running Mac OS 9 or Mac OS X:
 A PowerPC Mac of any speed with at least 64MB of memory and 1GB
of free hard drive space: Again, you need up to 6GB if you’re recording
DVDs.
 A CD or DVD recorder: Most Macs use external recorders with SCSI,
USB, or FireWire connections.
 Recording software: Mac OS X allows you to burn discs from the Finder
menu, and you can burn discs from within iTunes as well. Other com-
mercial recording programs are available, like Toast from Roxio.
 Blank media: Gotta have it.
If all this talk of connections is making you nervous, don’t worry: It’s all cov-
ered in rich detail in Chapters 2 and 3, including what you need to know
before you buy and install a drive.
“What Kinds of Discs Can I Record?”
This question is the easiest of all to answer: Everything! If you can use it on a
computer, listen to it in your stereo’s CD player, or watch it on your DVD
player, you can record it using either a CD or DVD recorder.
Later in this book, I take you step-by-step through the creation of different
types of discs; for now, this section gives you an overview.
Briefcase backup
Never heard of that term? It’s my own; I always carry a briefcase backup when
I’m traveling with my laptop. Because my computer has a CD-ROM drive (and
the notoriously small hard drive found on most laptops), I record on a CD-R
any files that are specific to my trip. PowerPoint presentations, Word files, con-
tracts, digital audio and video — even an offline copy of my Web site — they all
fit on a briefcase backup. Therefore, my trip-specific data doesn’t take up space
on my laptop’s hard drive, and it’s protected from damage. Plus, copying any of
that data to my client’s computer if necessary is a cinch: No cables, no network
configuration — just pop the disc in and read files and programs directly! (My
mom always said that I had potential.)
24
Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder! 

Computer files and data of all sorts
If it can be stored on your hard drive, you can store it on CD or DVD as well.
This includes
 Files and programs
 Digital images
 Sound clips
 Web sites
 Backups
Digital audio
With a CD-RW drive, you can record standard audio CDs for use in any audio
CD player, mixed CDs that have both audio and computer data, and MP3
discs that can be enjoyed on your computer and some audio CD players.
Plus, you can extract, or rip, tracks from existing audio CDs and record them
on a new disc in any order you choose.
Digital video
A CD-RW drive can create standard Video CDs for your Video CD player, and a
DVD-R/W or DVD+R/W drive can create interactive DVDs with your own digi-
tal video.
Network storage
If you have data that is accessed often but never changed on your home or
office network, record that data to a CD-R and load it in your file server’s
CD-ROM drive. (Getting your network administrator’s help with this process
is a good idea — those folks can get very nervous about such initiatives.)
Now you can still access every byte of those files, but you’re not using pre-
cious network hard drive space and you don’t have to worry about backing
up that information.
Photo discs
You can use your CD-RW or DVD recorder to create slideshow discs with
images from your digital camera or with scanned photographs.
25
Chapter 1: Optical Storage: It’s All in the Pits

Caring for Your Optical Pets
I tell you earlier in this chapter about how CD and DVD are nearly perfect
storage media — but notice the word nearly. You have two or three outstand-
ing methods of ruining a disc; the trick is not to become proficient at any of
them, so in this last section I cover the best ways to use, clean, and store
your discs.
You gotta grip ’em by the rim!
Let me sound like your mother for a second: Take a good, close look at your
hands! When was the last time you washed them? Reading data from a disc
covered in fingerprints and dust is a touch-and-go process at best because
the laser beam has to work harder to get through all that crud twice (espe-
cially on DVDs because the data is packed even closer together). Therefore,
you must find out how to hold a disc properly.
In my travels, I’ve encountered two methods of comfortably holding a disc
for a decent length of time. You can even jog or tap dance when using these
holds — whatever floats your boat. Either hold the disc by the outside edge,
as shown in Figure 1-6 or — if your fingers are small enough — create your
own spindle with a convenient finger, as shown in Figure 1-7.
Fingers grip on outside edge

26
Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder! 

It’s time for a dire Mark’s Maxim:
Never touch the underside of a disc, and never put a disc down (label-
side up) on any surface.™
Flipping a disc over and setting it label side down for a second or two is okay,
but put the disc back in its case as soon as possible.
The deadly enemies
To keep your discs safe and avoid skips or data read errors, shelter them
from these archvillains:
 Pointed objects: Scratches are taboo, and that goes for either side of a
disc.
 Heat: How would you like to spend a hot summer afternoon in a closed
car, baking on the seat? Underneath all that high tech, a disc is basically
a circle of plastic. Keep your discs cool and out of direct sunlight: A
warped disc is a terrible thing to behold. (Your audio CD player may not
be able to read it, either.)
 Surface crud: This includes liquids, dust, dirt, and peanut butter.
Figure 1-7:
Look, Aunt
Harriet, I’m
a spindle!
27
Chapter 1: Optical Storage: It’s All in the Pits

You may have seen one or more CD/DVD laser lens cleaners at your local
computer store; they usually look something like a disc with a little hairbrush
mounted on it. Never use one of these cleaners on a CD or DVD recorder
because it can damage the laser! In fact, the laser head inside a recorder needs
no maintenance.
The Disc Hotel
So where should you put all your recorded discs? Stacking them in a big pile
in front of your monitor is one answer, but it’s the wrong answer. Your discs
must be protected from dust and scratches! Of course, storing discs in their
jewel boxes is a good idea — that is, until you have an entire 200-disc stand
filled up, and it takes up an entire corner of your room! Take a tip from me
and my collection of over 1,200 audio CDs: You can save that space and still
provide the protection your discs need with a disc binder, as shown in Figure
1-8. A binder has individual pockets for anywhere from 10 to 250 discs, so you
can donate your jewel boxes to your friends.
Figure 1-8:

Sometimes you’ve just gotta wipe
You may say, “I’ve seen an entire shelf full of CD cleaning stuff at my local
Maze O’ Wires store. Do my discs need cleaning?” If a disc is only dusty, I rec-
ommend a lint-free photographer’s lens cloth, which you can pick up at any
camera shop. You can also pick up a spray bottle of disc cleaning fluid for
liquid disasters, like those unavoidable soda stains. Other than a cloth and
some fluid, however, you can leave all the expensive James Bond gadgets on
the shelf at the store.
To close this chapter on a high note, Figure 1-9 illustrates how to wipe a disc:
Start at the center spindle hole and wipe straight toward the outside of the
disc, making sure that you apply no more than fingertip pressure. Wiping
harder — or wiping in a circular motion, as shown in Figure 1-10 — can
scratch your disc and invite chaos into its ordered world of 1s and 0s (zeros).
Wipe a CD from
the center to the
edge in a straight
motion.

espite the rumors you may have heard, buying a CD or DVD recorder in
the modern world is no longer a dreadful experience (at least, not with
this book by your side). In days past, you would be at the mercy of that fast-
moving predator of the electronics store — the computer salesperson — who
would either turn on the high-pressure hose and sell you the most expensive
drive on the planet or stand motionless with hands in pockets, oblivious to
the answers to any of your questions. I know friends who still bear the emo-
tional and psychological scars of such an attack.
Today, however, you may never even enter a brick-and-mortar store to buy
your drive. If you’re on the Web, you can choose from literally hundreds of
online stores. You can shop 24 hours a day, at your leisure, and you have all
the time you need to compare features and prices. It’s paradise for those of
us who are ready to purchase online.
If your CD or DVD recorder is already installed and comfortable, you don’t
need this chapter (although you still may want to read it to brush up on
what’s available). If your computer came with a CD-RW, DVD-R/W, DVD+R/W,
or DVD-RAM drive, feel free to skip to Chapter 5. If, on the other hand, you’re
shopping for a CD or DVD recorder, you should devour every word to come.

In this chapter, I cover everything you need to know about buying a CD or
DVD drive, including the features you should covet, the differences between
internal and external drives, what type of connection you need, and the for-
mats your drive should record. Take copious notes or just circle the impor-
tant stuff directly in this book — whatever floats your boat.
I also provide you with tips on online shopping, which has both its peaks 
and its pitfalls. Finally, I even cover a few pointers on how to face those sales-
people sharks head-on at your local store and win. (As my favorite actor, 
Jack Nicholson, croons in the film Batman, “Wait ’til they get a load of me —
ooooOOOOoooop.”)
Enough talk. It’s time to go shopping.
Internal or External: Thinking 
Outside the Box
Your first choice to make in your trip down Hardware Boulevard is a simple
one, yet it has the most effect on the price and performance of a recorder. If
you’ve never run across these terms, an internal drive lives inside your com-
puter (just like your floppy drive or your existing read-only CD-ROM and
DVD-ROM drives). An external drive (illustrated in Figure 2-1) sits outside
your computer, using a power cord of its own and a connection of some sort
to your computer’s case.
Figure 2-1:
An external
drive is
ready to go
solo.
32
Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder! 

Stay inside with internal
Why not pick an internal drive? Most folks do, and here are the reasons why:
 Convenient: Your drive is built-in to your computer, without an extra
power cord to mess with and some sort of connection cable to boot.
 Fast: Depending on the interface, most internal drives are faster than
their external brethren. (Read more about this party topic in the follow-
ing section.)
 Cheap: Also, an internal drive is usually less expensive than an external
unit because it’s not carrying around its home like a digital hermit crab.
Breathe the open air with external
For some computers (for example, laptops and the stylish Apple iMac), you
have to pick an external drive because you have literally no room to install a
second internal drive. (I don’t recommend the hacksaw route.) However, a
number of good reasons explain why an external recorder would appeal to
even the stodgiest PC owner:
 It saves a bay: To explain, a bay is an internal space inside your PC’s
case where you can add devices. Most desktop PCs have several of
them, but technowizards and power users can easily fill up every bay
with other gadgets. Because the case has no room inside, an external
drive suddenly looks sexy and attractive (at least to them).
 It’s easy to install: Afraid to open your computer’s case? Believe me —
you are not alone, and you have no reason to be embarrassed. Adding
an external drive means that you can leave your desktop alone, and it
may even be easier than installing an internal drive. If you choose a USB
or FireWire drive, for example, the process is as simple as plugging in a
connector and the power cord. (Read more about USB and FireWire later
in this chapter, in the section “Edna, He Says We Need an Interface.”)
If you want to conquer your fear of computer hardware and delve inside
your PC’s case, let me recommend another of my books, conveniently
titled Building a PC For Dummies, 4th Edition, from Wiley Publishing, Inc.
In the process of showing you how to build an entire computer (yes, the
whole ball of wax), I cover the complete process of adding all sorts of
internal hardware, including an internal CD or DVD recorder.
 It’s portable: Everyone in the building can share your recorder, perhaps
as a backup device or to carry along with laptops. (By the way, you can
also lock up an external drive to keep it from being carried away, if you
get my drift.)
33
Chapter 2: Buying Your Recording Beast

Here’s the bottom line: Unless your computer simply doesn’t have room or
you don’t want to open it, I recommend saving money and sticking with an
internal recorder.
“Edna, He Says We Need an Interface”
Geez, what a word. It sounds like something you would hear from an engineer —
ack! — but the word interface really has a simple and straightforward meaning:
It’s the type of connection that you use to unite your computer and your recorder
in everlasting friendship (at least until you unplug them).
In this section, I help you determine which of these exotic connections is 
for you.
EIDE
The first connection I cover is the most popular for PC and Mac owners all
over the world — which, naturally, is why I want to begin with EIDE. Because
it’s not a freedom-loving English word, it must therefore be one of those 
doggone acronyms; in this case, EIDE stands for Enhanced Integrated Drive
Electronics. Unfortunately, EIDE drives don’t come in external form, so if you
need an external drive, you can skip to the next interface.
Virtually all desktop PCs built today use EIDE hard drives and read-only CD-
ROM and DVD-ROM drives. To handle the workload, your PC likely has both a
primary and secondary EIDE connector; each of these connectors supports
two EIDE devices, so you have the capacity for a total of four EIDE drives. If you
already have one hard drive and one read-only CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive in
your computer, you’re using only two of those four connections.
EIDE drives are simpler and cheaper to install than SCSI and are a good pick
for most home PCs.
SCSI
This time, the evil acronym, SCSI, is short for Small Computer System Interface.
SCSI is significantly faster and more efficient than a typical EIDE drive, and a
single SCSI card can connect anywhere from 8 to 14 different devices — which
is great if you plan to expand your computer to help NASA with the latest
Mars probe. (Seriously, a real power user can add things like scanners and
tape drives to a SCSI connection.) SCSI drives are available in both internal
and external form. If you have an older Macintosh computer, it likely has an
external SCSI port.
34
Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder! 

Unfortunately, SCSI is harder to configure than EIDE because a number of set-
tings have to be made correctly for anything to work. Also, a SCSI recorder is
usually significantly more expensive than its EIDE counterpart.
SCSI drives are a good choice for the experienced PC or Mac owner who’s
willing to spend a little more for better performance and all those extra con-
nections — but be prepared to spend more time configuring and fine-tuning.
USB
At least USB is only three letters long. It stands for Universal Serial Bus, a con-
nection type that’s used exclusively for external drives. Let me be honest with
you: USB is the best thing to happen to PC and Mac owners since the invention
of canned air. Yes, believe it or not, the same USB drive can be used by both
types of computers, and Figure 2-2 shows how simple it is to connect.

Sheer bliss.
35
Chapter 2: Buying Your Recording Beast

USB is Plug and Play, which means that you don’t have to reboot your com-
puter when you connect a USB recorder. Plus, your computer automatically
recognizes that USB drive, so you have nothing to fiddle with or set. Many
USB drives don’t even need a separate power supply.
On the downside, a USB 1.1 connection is much slower than an EIDE or SCSI
connection, so today’s fastest CD and DVD recorders can’t use it. You can’t
burn a DVD at all using a USB 1.1 connection, and CD burning is limited to 4X
or less. USB drives tend to be somewhat more expensive because USB is
external only. Finally, most older computers have only two USB ports, so if
you’re already using USB devices, you may need a USB hub; this little black
box converts one of your USB ports into four ports. Cool!
Although USB 1.1 is too slow for today’s recording hardware, I do have some
good news: Luckily, those engineers haven’t been loafing and resting on their
laurels, because the recently-introduced USB 2.0 is now quickly becoming
standard equipment on today’s PCs and Macs. USB 2.0 connections are so
speedy that they can easily handle the fastest external CD and DVD recorders
available today. Naturally, your computer needs USB 2.0 ports to use a USB
2.0 drive. As the Mark’s Maxim goes:
Demand USB 2.0 for your external drive . . . and install new ports if
necessary!™
I heartily recommend USB 2.0 for anyone who wants a typical external CD or
DVD recorder.
FireWire
Imagine a — hey, wait a second, FireWire’s not an acronym. Anyway, FireWire
is also fast enough for today’s high-speed drives, and it’s been around longer
than USB 2.0. (Technoheads also call it the IEEE-1394, and you may see it
advertised as such when shopping for digital camcorders.)
FireWire (developed by Apple) has all the advantages of USB, and it also
comes in two flavors: FireWire 400, the original standard, and the new
FireWire 800 (which is twice as fast, and currently available only in the Mac
world). Both types of FireWire connections work great for external CD and
DVD recorders. As an additional bonus, you can use a FireWire 400 port for
connecting many digital cameras, DV camcorders, scanners, and the like.
What’s the catch? Only external drives need apply, and FireWire drives are
typically a little more expensive than a USB 2.0 drive. All current Macintosh
computers now have FireWire built-in (naturally), and PC owners can add
FireWire ports by installing an adapter card.
FireWire 400 is the best all-around choice for high-performance external
recorders, because it connects far more devices to your computer.

The X Factor Explained
Of all the gobbledygook associated with buying a CD or DVD recorder, noth-
ing is as foreign to a normal human being — or affects the price of a drive as
much — as the X factor. You encounter these X numbers in every description
of every drive you see, so I cover the X factor thing like a wet blanket (or a
new coat of paint).
In plain English, the X factor is the speed at which a drive can read and record
data. For CD recorders, these speeds are typically expressed as three numbers,
like 40X/12X/48X. The order is always important:
 The first number indicates the CD-R recording speed.
 The second number is the CD-RW recording speed.
 The last number provides the read-only speed.
Therefore, whenever you apply these conventions to the example, you’re
looking at a drive that can record a CD-R at 40X and a CD-RW at 12X, and can
read a CD-ROM at 48X. Naturally, higher numbers are better, so follow this
general Mark’s Maxim (I really like those):
The faster the X factor, the faster the drive performs at either recording
or reading data.™
On the DVD side, you typically only see one X number — that’s the recording
speed for the drive. (Of course, because a DVD recorder can also burn CD-Rs
and CD-RWs, you can see the familiar three-number X factor combination in
the specs as well.)
37
Chapter 2: Buying Your Recording Beast
Avoid those ancient parallel port drives!
If you’re using an older laptop without USB ports,
you might hear about parallel port drives, which
use the existing parallel printer port found on vir-
tually every PC on the planet. (Macintosh com-
puters have no parallel port, so this is not an
option for them.)
Visualize a huge, flashing STOP sign: Stay away
from parallel port CD recorders! These ancient
relics are ridiculously slow — think 2X or slower —
and more prone to errors, and they often don’t work
if you’re already using a printer or another external
device, like a Zip drive or a scanner, on your printer
port.
These days, a parallel port CD recorder isn’t even
worth scavenging as a doorstop, so avoid such
drives like the zombies they are. Instead, see
whether your PC can use an adapter to provide a
minimum of USB 1.1 connectivity, with USB 2.0 or
FireWire 400 preferred.

Most internal CD drives on the market these days do at least 24X CD-R
recording, and most external CD drives record at a minimum of 16X.
If you’re considering a drive that’s slower than 8X, promise me that you won’t
pay much (if anything) when you buy it. A 2X or 4X recorder is an antique
now — of course, it works fine if your Uncle Milton gives it to you for free.
Scavengers forever!
For those who care about such arcane measurements, the CD recording X
factor is technically a multiplier of the original read-only speed for the first
drives that appeared in the early 1980s. (You can call them 1X drives.) These
1X drives could send data to a computer at 150K per second. Therefore, a 2X
CD-ROM drive can send data to a computer at 300K per second. Read-only
drives can now reach blinding transfer rates of 52X, or 7800K per second. The
same holds true for the DVD recording X factor, which is based on the origi-
nal 1X DVD recording speed.
The X Factor General Maxim (or, in the acronym-happy world of computers,
the XFGM) that I state earlier in this section seems to recommend that you
shell out every possible penny for the fastest drive around. If you were Bill
Gates, you would be right. However, common folk like you and me have things
called budgets, so buying the fastest sports car of a recorder may not always
be the best road to take. For example:
 If your computer already has a 40X or 48X read-only CD-ROM drive — in
the DVD-ROM world, a 16X read-only drive — you don’t need to spend
anything extra for faster read-only speeds. Play your games and video in
the read-only drive, and use the recorder just for burning discs.
 If you plan to use your new drive exclusively for recording audio CDs,
why pay extra for a drive that records CD-RWs, DVD-R/Ws, or DVD+R/Ws
faster? A faster rewriteable speed is better suited for you if you plan to
use it to back up your computer’s hard drive.
 If you plan to record once or twice a week and you can wait the extra
four or five minutes per disc, an 8X CD-RW drive works just as well as a
40X drive that may cost twice as much.
In the end, the drive performance you should choose depends on the number
of discs that you record, how fast you want them, and the difference in price
for a faster drive.
Features on Parade
The earlier sections of this chapter cover the three big features: internal versus
external, drive connections, and raw speed figures. Now consider individual
38
Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder! 

features that add convenience, performance, and (coincidentally) cost to a
drive. The more of these that you can pack into your purchase, the happier you
will be. Note that I also mention which features are especially important for
certain recording tasks. Believe me — it’s better to discover that a drive has a
tiny recording buffer before you buy it.
Make use of every pit: Overburning
Sounds like you’re making digital toast, doesn’t it? Overburning is a fairly
recent phenomenon in the world of CD recording; it refers to a drive that can
record more than the manufacturer’s stated maximum capacity of a CD-R. For
example, a drive that can overburn to 76 minutes can record 76 minutes of
music on a standard 74-minute CD-R, or you could use the same drive to
store 685MB of data rather than 650MB. The amount that you can overburn
depends on your recorder and the specific brand and storage capacity of the
discs that you’re using. For example, 82-minute discs with more than 700MB
of space are now available (but, as you might expect, these new discs aren’t
compatible with most drives older than three or four years).
Overburning is mucho grande, but you must remember two caveats:
 Most CD-ROM drives made in the past two or three years have no trou-
ble with overburned discs, although some older drives spit them back
out as unreadable. Therefore, if you distribute your discs, I recommend
that you don’t overburn them.
 Media manufacturers don’t guarantee their discs past the 74- or 80-minute
rating, so you overburn at your own risk.
How does a drive overburn? It uses the lead-out portion of the disc, which was
not originally intended to store data; in fact, the lead-out area is supposed to
indicate to your drive that it has reached the end of the disc. When you over-
burn, you’re burning past that point. If your read-only CD-ROM drive doesn’t
care and can read an overburned CD-ROM, you’re, in effect, storing more in
the same space. Real 8-bit old-timers like myself who used the early Atari and
Commodore computers remember something similar: We used to flip over a
5 1⁄4-inch single-density disk and use the other side, which you weren’t supposed
to do. Shameful, really.
Important: Any CD recorder can use an 80-minute CD-R — you’re not over-
burning when you put 80 minutes of music or 700MB of data on this kind of
media. Again, however, not every recorder can use these larger-capacity discs;
check the specifications of any recorder that you’re considering buying to see
whether it can use 80-minute/700MB discs.
39
Chapter 2: Buying Your Recording Beast

Three words: Buffer, buffer, buffer
For today’s faster drives, a large data buffer (also known as an internal RAM
or RAM cache) is indeed an important feature. All recorders have at least
some buffer RAM. This memory stores data that your computer has retrieved
from your hard drive until your recorder is ready for it. Figure 2-3 tells the
tale. The larger the buffer, the more efficient this process becomes, and the
less likely your drive is to return an error and ruin a disc because it ran out of
data to write.
Most drives made these days have at least 4MB of buffer memory, and more
expensive drives can have 8MB or even 16MB. When comparing drives,
always try to pick a model with a larger buffer.
The ultimate safety net: Burnproof recording
Consider now the hottest-burning feature (horrible pun intended) to come
along in several years. Burnproof recorders effectively end any problems that
folks generally had when they were
 Recording on slower PCs
 Recording in the background under Windows or the Mac operating
system (for example, using Word or Internet Explorer while recording)
 Recording at high speeds (12X or faster)
Before the arrival of burnproof drives two or three years ago, engaging in one
of these activities was risky business indeed. As you may have read in earlier
sections in this chapter, a recorder had to have a constant flow of data to pre-
vent Buffer Underrun errors. Any interruption or hiccup in the transfer of data
from the computer’s hard drive to the recorder was usually disastrous. A larger
buffer helped, but that still didn’t solve the problem entirely, and your recorder
certainly couldn’t stop in the middle of a disc — it was now or never.

Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder! 

If your CD-RW drive doesn’t support burnproof recording, you should be
happy to know that I devote Chapter 6 to helping you optimize your com-
puter and recorder to prevent Buffer Underrun errors. Virtually all DVD
recorders support burnproof recording, so fear not.
Burnproof recording eliminates the potential for data errors by interrupting
the recording process. The drive monitors the buffer, and when things look
dangerous (for example, if you’ve run Adobe Photoshop, which is a notorious
disk and memory hog), the recorder takes note of the position of the laser
and stops recording. After the buffer has been refilled (which can take a few
seconds), the laser write head is automatically repositioned at the point
where the recording was interrupted and the recording process continues.
I can’t stress just how revolutionary burnproof recording really is. If you can
afford this feature (which is now available on virtually all CD-RW drives), by
all means, get it.
Disc-at-Once: Funny name, 
important feature
Here’s one feature I always recommend: I wouldn’t buy a drive that doesn’t
offer Disc-at-Once recording. (Is that a definite enough recommendation?)
Rather than record digital audio or computer data as individual tracks, Disc-
at-Once records the entire disc at one time (you find out all about this sub-
ject in Chapter 7). Suffice it to say that the audio CDs that you record sound
better on some audio CD players, and you can get more music on a single
disc if you use Disc-at-Once. Again, check a drive’s specifications to see
whether it offers Disc-at-Once recording.
Sorry, but It’s Time to Talk 
CD and DVD Formats
Formats are tricky things. Any CD-RW drive can create a simple audio CD
(which by definition conforms to an international set of format standards
called the Red Book) or a simple data CD-ROM with files on it (which uses the
Yellow and Orange Book standards). You don’t have to worry about these basic
functions; for a CD or DVD recorder, they’re like walking and chewing gum.
41
Chapter 2: Buying Your Recording Beast

However, there’s no telling when you may suddenly find yourself needing a
Video CD or a CD Extra disc, and if your drive doesn’t support them, it can
never record those discs. You can’t add formats to your drive after you’ve
bought it.
Therefore, this section has two goals: First, I introduce you to each format,
and then I help you determine which of them you’re likely to need later.
Here’s another Mark’s Maxim to chew on:
Cast your purchasing eye on the drive that can write the largest
number of formats.™
UDF/Packet writing
If you skipped it my discussion of burnproof recording earlier in this chapter,
you should flip back to the section “The ultimate safety net: Burnproof
recording” and read it. I’ll wait for you here.
Anyway, packet writing (or, as the format is officially named, UDF) is almost as
cool as burnproof recording: It allows you to write files to a CD or DVD just as
you would write files to your hard drive, using Windows Explorer, the Mac OS
Finder, or any of your other applications. You can add files one at a time or in
groups, without having to record the entire disc at one sitting. In effect, packet
writing turns your drive into a gigantic, superfast floppy that can store more
than 600MB (or a whopping 4.6GB).
You can also “erase” data from a disc. Yes, I tell you in Chapter 1 that you
can’t erase data from a CD-R, DVD-R, or DVD+R, but I’m stretching the truth a
bit. Rather than be physically removed from the disc, the data you’re erasing
becomes unreadable, so it can’t be retrieved. The data is still there — you
just can’t access it.
Again, it’s time to be blunt: Virtually all CD and DVD drives now available sup-
port the UDF format, and I wouldn’t buy one if it didn’t.
Video CD
Although DVD-R and DVD+R are the unequivocal kings of digital video record-
ing, those of you with lowly CD-RW drives can produce your own brand of
visual magic: A drive that records in Video CD format can create discs for a
Video CD player (and most DVD players can read them, too). Most CD-ROMs
and DVD-ROM drives can now also read Video CDs — all you need is the right
software. I use Windows Media Player.
42
Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder! 

With a Video CD, you have many of the same features that you would find on
a DVD player, including an interactive menu for selecting video clips and
freeze-frame or slow-motion effects.
CD Extra
Another format that has recently come into its own, CD Extra allows you to
record a disc with a mixture of audio and data tracks. Why create a mutant
disc like this? Most computers these days have high-fidelity audio systems,
so many musicians are using CD Extra to add a music video, song lyrics, and
other multimedia material to their audio CDs. (Remember that the disc can
also be played on your computer’s CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive.) For example,
two of my favorite bands — the Squirrel Nut Zippers and the Rolling Stones —
have turned out CD Extra discs in the past.
A CD Extra disc doesn’t overlook the folks who just want to listen to the disc
in an audio CD player. The audio track on a CD Extra disc is recorded first, so
it’s compatible with any audio CD player — in fact, the player doesn’t know
the difference. The only restriction, naturally, is the amount of audio that you
can record on a CD Extra disc: Because you’re adding data as well, you don’t
get a full 74 or 80 minutes of audio elbowroom.
Multisession/CD-ROM XA
I can’t discuss CD-ROM XA format without introducing you to the idea of a
session, so here goes: A session is, in effect, a self-contained dataset recorded
on a disc. In English, think of it as a single track on an audio CD. You can store
multiple tracks on one disc and access each of them individually as you like.
As an example, think of one year’s tax returns recorded in one session, fol-
lowed by the next year’s returns in the next session; it’s a way to update the
existing data on a CD without losing the old data. Each of the sessions on a
multisession mode CD-ROM XA disc can be read, but only one at a time. (I get
into this subject more in Chapter 8.)
CD-ROM XA isn’t anywhere as popular as it once was because of three gotchas:
 Not all CD-ROM drives can read CD-ROM XA: Truly antique read-only
CD-ROM drives may be able to read only the last session recorded or
may not even be able to read the disc.
 Software is required in order to change sessions: Some sort of session-
selection program or function is necessary; it comes with most CD
recording programs, but if you’re sending a disc to someone else and
that person doesn’t have the session-changing software (or a CD or DVD
recorder), she’s out of luck.
43
Chapter 2: Buying Your Recording Beast

 Packet writing is better: The availability of the UDF format on most
drives has made multisession recording as outmoded as the Model T.
Packet writing is far easier than recording multiple sessions.
Software You Just Gotta Have
I really shouldn’t say that: Of course, the software you receive with your
recorder isn’t as important as the hardware itself. After all, you can always
add software later or upgrade what you have. Hardware is, well, hard. Other
than a firmware upgrade, your drive’s features and performance are fixed, so
the software should take a back seat (not too far back, though).
Often, one drive you’re considering has a much better selection of software
than another. If their prices, features, and speeds are similar, a superior soft-
ware selection can tip the scales. However, every CD recorder that you con-
sider should ship with basic recording software that
44
Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder! 
Digging deep for specifications
I admit that I’m letting loose a landslide of fea-
tures and formats in this chapter, but I have a
reason: I don’t know how you will use your drive,
so I can’t tell you what features and formats are
most important for you. Instead, I explain all the
relevant stuff, and you can pick and choose
what’s necessary for your Dream Drive.
Unfortunately, the Feature Fairy doesn’t drop in
to tell you what formats and features are sup-
ported by a drive, or what software ships with it.
To buy the best drive for you, you have to roll up
your sleeves and do the research. First, visit the
manufacturer’s Web site and look for that all-
important specification sheet. (This is also a good
time to check on the quality of the manufacturer’s
support, like updated drivers, firmware upgrades,
and FAQ files.) In many cases, the specification
list should tell you everything you need to know.
Next, try visiting www.buy.com or www.price
watch.com, where product features can be
compared side-by-side among different drives.
These sites are great for asking questions like
“Which 12X CD-RW drives are under $300 and
have burnproof recording?”
If you have an Internet connection and you’re
familiar with newsgroups, I recommend comp.
publish.cdrom.hardwareand alt.comp.
hardware. Someone in one of these groups
may know the features of a particular drive
(although you may get opinions mixed in liberally
with your answers).
Most computer magazines have online Web
editions, and they often cover CD and DVD
recorders with hardware comparisons and per-
formance evaluations. Finally, use a search
engine, such as www.google.com, to locate
information about a specific make and model of
drive; you may be surprised at what turns up.

 Allows you to burn discs in all supported formats
 Erases and formats CD-RWs
 Tests for proper installation and configuration of your drive
My favorite recording software is Easy CD & DVD Creator, from Roxio, and I use
it throughout much of this book. I’m also fond of Nero Burning ROM, though,
from Ahead Software at www.nero.com (see Figure 2-4), and the great share-
ware program CDRWIN, from Golden Hawk Software at www.goldenhawk.com
(see Figure 2-5). On the Macintosh, my recording program of choice is Roxio
Toast (www.roxio.com), which I also use later in this book, in Chapter 9.
After you’ve taken care of the basics, however, you find that some drives
offer additional software that can save you money and — as the marketing
types would say — “enhances your recording experience.” (In other words,
the more of this nifty software you get, the better off you are.) I cover this
extra stuff you want in the following three sections.

A sharp-dressed disc
Can you imagine Fred Astaire in a leisure suit? No way! The tuxedo was prac-
tically made for him. Many people feel the same way about the discs they
record: They want those discs to look as professional as possible. One way to
do this is to spend a couple of thousand dollars on a disc label screen printer.
If you would rather save the cash and put your inkjet printer to work, these
programs can spruce up the appearance of a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM:
 Label-printing software: Print labels with everything from simple text 
to line art or full-color photographs. Labels are particularly nice for
audio CDs.
 Jewel box printing software: You can print custom front and back inserts
for a disc’s jewel box (that plastic whatchamacallit that stores the disc)
or DVD snap-case. I think that it completes the look of a recorded disc.
Again, audio CDs benefit from track listings, and computer discs can use
the space for file descriptions or installation instructions.
I cover both these bad boys in Chapter 14, including a step-by-step project
that shows how to create inserts and a label.

Slick recording add-ons
As I mention earlier in this chapter, any self-respecting recording program
should be able to take care of basic recording tasks all by itself, although sep-
arate add-on programs can take care of specialized recording jobs:
 Packet writing software: Why run that big, stodgy recording program
each time you want to write a UDF disc? With this thought in mind, most
software developers spin off packet writing into a separate program that
can run in the background under Windows or the Mac operating system.
The perfect example is Drag-to-Disc, from Roxio: It runs automatically
when you start your PC and doesn’t require Easy CD & DVD Creator.
(Read more about this program in Chapter 10.)
 Backup and disaster-recovery software: Call these programs digital
peace of mind — use your CD-RW to back up either part or all of your
system, and you can rest easy at night. I use Retrospect, from Dantz
Development (see Figure 2-6), which can even format your rewriteable
media for you. I’ve said it before in most of my books, and I say it again:
If you value your data, back it up.
Are you already using a backup program with a tape drive or Zip disks? If so,
check to see whether it already supports the use of a rewriteable CD or DVD
drive: If so, you can keep original backup sets, avoiding a hole in your backup
schedule while you switch to the optical world.

Tools to organize and play your stuff
I go into the organization of your recording projects in complete detail in
Chapter 7. For now, suffice it to say that some of the following programs
make finding stuff on your finished discs easier, and other software is
required to play the digital video and audio you’ve recorded:
 Image- and video-editing software: Many drives are bundled with an
image editor for digital photographs and a simple video editor for chop-
ping Uncle Milton out of this year’s Christmas video. This feature makes
sense because the majority of recorder owners probably burn digital
images and video all the time.
 Multimedia filing software: Think of these programs as organizers for
your audio, video, and images; the programs can help you locate and
retrieve a single clip or image from thousands stored on a single disc for
your next presentation or Office document. Plus, you can play or view
those images from within the program to make sure that you’ve found
the right one. My favorite multimedia filing program is Media Center
Plus, from Jasc Software, as shown in Figure 2-7.
 Audio CD/MP3/WAV player: If you don’t get an audio media player with
your recorder, you will need one eventually. My favorite is Winamp (see
Figure 2-8), from Nullsoft, Inc., which can handle almost anything you
encounter: audio in MP3 format, audio CDs themselves, Windows WAV
files, and Macintosh AIFF files. Plus, it marks you as technokeen. You can
find Winamp at www.winamp.com.

 Video CD/MPEG player: The counterpart to your audio media player, a

My favorite is PowerDVD, from CyberLink, which can play Video CDs on
any CD-ROM drive; if you have a DVD-ROM or DVD-R drive, it can also
turn your computer into your own, personal DVD theater. Figure 2-9

Scavenging Fossilized 
CD and DVD Drives
The vulture may not be the prettiest scavenger on the planet, but it gets the
job done. In the world of computer hardware, a scavenged component can
often bring you and your computer a world of new possibilities for little or no
cost. This is a good thing, and I’m proud to say that I’ve been scavenging for
many years.
Fate can present a number of different ways to acquire a used recorder: You
may inherit one from a family member or friend who’s upgrading, or you may
stumble across one at a garage sale. The most popular method of picking up
a used drive, however, is probably one of the online auction centers; eBay is
the prime location (www.eBay.com). If you’re looking for a used drive, here’s
what I recommend:
 Don’t settle for less than 8X for a CD-RW drive: Unless someone flat out
gives you a 2X drive for free, ignore the deal and move on. These drives
are just too slow, and any drive with such poor performance probably
doesn’t have features like Disc-at-Once recording or a decent-size buffer.
(Any DVD recorder is still worth scavenging if it’s free, no matter what
the speed!)
 Get those drivers: Nothing is quite as frustrating as searching the world
over for CD recorder device drivers, especially when the drive is five
years old or more. If you’re running Windows 98 or later, the process is
easier because the operating system comes with a host of drivers built-
in. The moral? Whenever possible, get the original software and manual
for a drive, and check the manufacturer’s Web site to see whether you
can still find software and support.
 Buy from recognized sellers: The seller feedback ratings on eBay make
seeing who has a good track record easy, so use them; if a seller has a
feedback rating of less than five or has a number of negative feedback
entries, be wary. Don’t be shy about asking questions through e-mail, and
keep an eye out for exorbitant handling charges. (I do lots of selling on
eBay myself, and I’ve never charged someone for the overwhelmingly dif-
ficult act of slipping something into an envelope or packing it in a box.)
 Consider new versus used: Finally, consider the current prices for a new
drive: At the time this book was written, I could pick up a 40X/12X/48X
CD-RW drive for less than $50. Before you spend more than $25 on a
used drive, make sure that you’re really getting a bargain.

Buying Your Drive at the 
Maze o’ Wires Mall
Let me set one thing straight: You should feel no shame in buying locally. In
the following section, I harp away on the advantages of buying online, and I
admit that I buy most of my hardware on the Web these days. However, where
you buy your drive is your business, and I don’t try to push you into shoving
dollars through your modem.
Besides the help from a salesperson (hopefully one who really knows all the
ins and outs of recording), a local store offers three things that no Web store
can ever match: immediate delivery, hands-on shopping, and a fast, friendly
return policy. (No matter how good Internet Explorer becomes, you can’t use
your mouse to open a box that’s 2,000 miles away.) No waiting is involved to
either receive your drive or to bring it back if you find that you’re the proud
owner of a lemon.
Watch out, however, for pressure tactics from a sales thug. Ask plenty of
questions, request a demo, and bring along a knowledgeable friend to help
you shop. Check out several stores before settling on one drive.
Considering buying returned (or refurbished) hardware? Have the salesper-
son connect the drive and give it a thorough check before you take it home.
Also, don’t forget to ask what kind of warranty you receive on your purchase.

Chapter 2: Buying Your Recording Beast
No lock, no sale
If you’re ready to buy a recorder online and the
Web store doesn’t offer a secure connection,
tell ’em to take a hike. A secure connection is
encrypted to protect your credit card number
and personal information, which makes it chal-
lenging for the online criminal element to inter-
cept your data as it’s sent to the Web site.
If you’re using Internet Explorer or Netscape
Navigator, look for a closed padlock icon on the
status bar at the bottom of the browser’s screen.
(For Mac owners using Safari, the lock appears
at the upper-right corner of the window.) If you
see the lock, the connection is secure, and you
can enter your information. If you don’t see a
locked padlock icon (or the lock is open and not
closed) and you’re being asked for your personal
information and card number, I would immedi-
ately move on to the next online store.

Your drive costs you more, and you pay local sales tax, but if you’re nervous
about buying online or you want to install that drive tonight, jump in the car
and head to your local computer marketplace.
Buying Your Drive on that Web Thing
“Okay, I need to save money, and I’ve got a credit card — plus, it’s hurricane
season, I have nothing clean to wear, and my favorite episode of My Three
Sons is starting in five minutes. Can I buy a drive online?” Indeed, you can —
in fact, in a situation like that, it’s sheer madness to buy locally.
It really does take only five minutes to buy your recorder on the Web (after, 
of course, you’ve done your thorough research). The Web offers the widest
selection of drives at the lowest prices, and you can use sites like www.
pricewatch.com to search out the best deal. Depending on the state you’re in
(pun not intended that time), you may be exempt from local sales taxes, too.
Why pay for next-day or second-day shipping if you’re not itching for the
fastest delivery? Many sites select next-day shipping as a default option, and
you’re stuck paying twice or three times the cost of five-day shipping. Don’t
fall for this old trick: Choose the shipping option that suits your pocketbook.
One final word about ordering on the Web: Most mail-order companies charge
a virtual arm and a leg for restocking your drive if you decide to return it.
Make sure that you’re not charged if you have to return a defective recorder.

DVD Is the Cat’s Meow
In This Chapter
 Comparing recordable DVD media
 Understanding DVD copy protection
 Choosing a DVD recording format
 Shopping for additional hardware and software
I
n the early 1980s, the acceptance of CD-ROM by the general public was
painfully slow but perfectly understandable. For example, John T. Everyman
had listened to vinyl albums all his life and had just begun to mesh with the
psychology of the cassette tape. Along came the audio CD, and many folks
couldn’t help but ask, “Is this just a flash in the pan, like my Betamax VCR?”
Because only a handful of plants manufacturing CDs existed, CD-ROMs started
out prohibitively expensive, and the first year or two saw only a pitiful selection.
What was worse, recording your own CD was science fiction for more than a
decade: Developing the technology took several years, and then when the
first CD-R drives appeared, they were priced so high that technotypes like
myself got nosebleeds just reading the advertisements. I can remember wish-
ing that I had $6,000 — that’s right; six thousand dollars — so that I could
become an optical alchemist and burn like professional musicians and video
editors. Only around 1995 or so did CD recorders descend from the heavens
to less than $1,000, and it took three more years for the typical CD recorder
to drop to less than $500. Recording software? You may as well have written
it yourself because what was available was almost as expensive as the drive.
Thank goodness, we have all learned our lesson. Things have changed so dra-
matically that the introduction of DVD a few years ago was a complete mirror
image of the early years of the compact disc. First, the CD-ROM has become
so common that DVD was immediately accepted as “the next step in optical
media.” No uncertainty, wailing, or gnashing of teeth this time. We all want the
storage space and convenience of DVD. A large number of well-established fac-
tories were already ready and waiting to produce DVDs, and the selection of
films has mushroomed quickly. Prices on many popular DVD movies are less
than $10, and the selection grows every day.

Finally, DVD recording is light-years ahead of where CD recording was at this
stage of the game. Drives have reached rock-bottom prices, and software
abounds to help you produce your own interactive discs. Many computers
are already shipping with DVD-R/W and DVD+R/W drives, and prices continue
to drop across the board for all types of recordable DVD blank media.
Many features that I cover in Chapter 2 apply in this chapter as well, such as
internal versus external drives and the connections you can use. Therefore, I
focus more on the important questions you need to ask before you plunk
down your hard-earned greenbacks for a new DVD drive. I also include a dis-
cussion of additional hardware and software that comes in handy before you
record as well as information on those pesky DVD formats.
“Do I Need DVD-R/W, DVD+
R/W, or DVD-RAM?”
Do you need a rewriteable DVD-R/W drive or a DVD-RAM model? Why not get
all three? (Oh, brother.) Unless you’ve been hanging out with the good folks
at the lottery commission, that’s probably not an option. You can, however,
find many drives on the market that can use both DVD-R/W and DVD+R/W,
like the Sony DRU-510. (Talk about alphabet soup! For the definition of each
acronym that I’m tossing around, visit Chapter 1.)
However, I still have good news: The relative strengths of all three types of
recordable DVD media make it easy to decide which one you need. Check out
Table 3-1 for the scoop.

Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder! 

Although I break DVD-R and DVD-RW into separate categories in the table, it’s
getting harder and harder to find a drive that records only DVD-R — and the
same holds true for DVD+R/W. This trend mirrors the development of CD-RW
technology. Try finding a drive that burns only CD-Rs these days! (I dare you.)
I should point out something else about Table 3-1: Besides being incredibly
informative, it uses the words almost and usually, which don’t show up in many
definitive tables. Why? The answer lies not in today’s recorders, but rather in
yesterday’s DVD-ROM players: Four distinct generations of DVD-ROM players
have existed since their introduction in late 1997, and each succeeding genera-
tion has a better chance of reading DVD-Rs, DVD+Rs, and DVD-RAMs.
The result is a big question mark. Because of the wide disparity in manufac-
turers, I honestly can’t tell you whether the DVD-ROM player you have now
reads any type of burned disc. If you’re using a DVD+R or DVD-RAM, you have
the best chance with a DVD-ROM player manufactured since the beginning of
2001. If you’re using DVD-R, you have the best chance with a DVD-ROM player
made after late 1999. Thoroughly confused now? Sorry about that. This alpha-
bet soup of different standards and rapidly evolving hardware can turn a
computer book author’s hair very gray very quickly.
Anyway, here are my recommendations. First, pick DVD-R/W if
 You’re looking for the highest level of compatibility with all DVD-ROM
drives.
 You’re distributing discs to others.
Pick DVD+R/W if
 You’re looking for compatibility with the latest DVD-ROM drives.
 You want to spend a little less on media.
Choose DVD-RAM if
 Compatibility with DVD-ROM drives is not an issue, such as when you’re
creating backups or discs that you read only on your computer.
 You want to rewrite the largest amount of data on an existing disc.
Oh, and yes, Virginia: You can read a commercially manufactured DVD-ROM
movie disc in either type of recorder. At least I can guarantee you the extra
bonus of adding a DVD-ROM drive to your computer when you install a DVD
recorder.
55
Chapter 3: DVD Is the Cat’s Meow

“Hey — I Can’t Copy ‘Curse 
of the Mollusk People’!”
Man, of all the clunkers that Hollywood has turned out, why would you possi-
bly want to copy a movie about mobile glowing clams that enslave the minds
of simple townsfolk? (I’ve bought titles like Robot Monster, Nude on the Moon,
and Blood Feast for my collection. Perhaps I shouldn’t be too proud.)
Anyway, you can’t just copy a DVD-ROM movie for good reason: Lots of smart
engineers, software developers, and designers worked hard to make sure that
you can’t. Some discs are protected by the addition of unreadable areas on the
disc during manufacture, and other protection schemes involve encrypted key
codes that must be present on the disc for it to be recognized by either your
player or your computer’s DVD-ROM drive.
Sure, some programs on the market purport to create direct copies of DVD
movies, but most DVD movies hold more than 4.7GB — in fact, many now
cram a whopping 8GB onto a single disc. (After all, commercial DVDs can 
be mastered with more than one data layer. Turn to Chapter 1 for details.)
Because current DVD technology can only burn 4.7GB on a DVD-R or DVD+R,
those pirating programs have two options:
 Spread a single movie across two or more recordable discs, with a nasty
pause involved (while you or your significant other is banished from the
couch to change the discs).
 Compress the digital video on the disc up to 50 percent so that it can be
stored on a single disc, which typically results in a noticeable loss in pic-
ture quality.
This stuff gets really technical really quickly, so I don’t go into it here in any
great detail. Suffice it to say that buying a DVD-R/W, DVD+R/W, or DVD-RAM
drive is not a free ticket to a shelf of cheap movies.
(And no, I didn’t think that you would do such a thing. Copyrights are impor-
tant — ask any book author.)
Weird, Wild DVD Format Stuff
Close the windows, bar the door: You can’t escape them. I have two more
acronyms to discuss, and I do the best I can to make sure that we all make it
out of this section in one piece.
56
Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder! 

DVD-V
If you’ve been perusing the DVD movie aisle at your local discount store, 
you may think that you were looking at DVD-ROM — and you would be right.
However, I can be even more specific than that: A DVD-V (short for DVD-Video,
of all things) is a DVD-ROM that holds broadcast-quality digital video in a spe-
cial compressed format named MPEG-2. (You find out a little more about MPEG
in the section “The MPEG card: Aye, Matey, ’tis indeed a tiny file” later in this
chapter, and much more in Chapter 13.) You also get niceties like Dolby audio,
surround sound, subtitles, and different aspect ratios with a DVD-V. You can
even run programs from a DVD-V if you’re playing it in a computer DVD-ROM
drive.
You may ask, “Can I burn a commercial-quality DVD-V with my new DVD
recorder?” Technically, yes. However, lots of work is involved in compressing
digital video, creating interactive menus, and adding a quality audio track. It’s
nowhere near as simple as recording something on comfortable old VHS tape,
but I show you how to do some of this good stuff in Chapter 13 of this book.
DVD-A
I know that this might break your heart, but even your friend the audio CD is
eventually going out to pasture. The likely replacement is a format standard
named DVD-A, or DVD-Audio. Imagine a standard audio CD that has been to
the gym four nights a week for the past 10 years, and you get some idea of
what DVD-A is like: either two or four hours of stereo music (depending on
the type of media); interactive menus, like with the current crop of DVD-Vs;
and even the ability to store video clips. Plus, DVD-As store music at a higher
quality than standard audio CDs and with an even higher dynamic range . . .
in other words, they sound even better than your rusty old CDs.
For me, however, the most exciting new feature of DVD-A is the addition of
surround sound support. If you’re enjoying a surround sound system, you
know how realistic it is. If not, try out this type of system the next time you’re
in a stereo and video store. Although the extra data needed for surround
sound cuts the capacity of a DVD-A in half, you’re still talking about an hour
or two of incredible music.
Additional Toys You Just May Need
Before the sun sets on this introductory discussion of DVD recording, I would
be remiss if I didn’t tell you that you’re likely to need a little additional hardware
and software. Why? To make the most of the expanded features of DVD, you
57
Chapter 3: DVD Is the Cat’s Meow

need to import video, edit those clips, convert them to different formats, and
design your menu system — not necessarily in that order — and there just isn’t
the need to do most of those things when you’re recording a CD-R or CD-RW.
In this section of your palatial mansion, allow me to show you some of the
extras you’re likely to use.
The MPEG card: Aye, Matey, 
’tis indeed a tiny file
If you’re serious about creating your own DVD-Vs — or even experimenting
with simple Video CDs and digital video clips — you should consider an
MPEG-2 adapter card for your computer. As I mention earlier in this chapter,
MPEG-2 is a compression format; it’s somewhat similar to the space you save
when you use Zip compression to shrink a file on your hard drive. And, boy,
howdy, do you need it: High-quality digital video that’s bigger than a postage
stamp on your screen takes up an incredible amount of space. Without com-
pressing (or encoding) the video, you’re likely to run out of room on even the
highest-capacity DVD media.
If you’re wondering about that term digital video (also called DV, for short),
indeed, no film or magnetism is involved. Digital video is composed of the
same familiar 1s and 0s (zeros) that are written to a recordable CD or DVD.
Unlike a traditional videotape (which can stretch and lose its magnetic prop-
erties), you can edit, copy, and play digital video as many times as you like
without losing quality.
Most MPEG-2 cards have two functions: They can encode video to shrink it,
and they can also decode it so that you can watch it on your computer’s
screen. (If you receive an MPEG-2 card with a DVD-ROM drive, however, it
likely just decodes so that you can watch DVD movies.)
Both these chores can be taken care of by software programs, but I always
recommend a hardware solution for folks who want to do any serious MPEG-2
video work. The advantages of the card over software include
 Speed: Software encoding and decoding programs are nowhere near as
fast as an MPEG-2 card, so a process that can take minutes with a card
can take hours with a program. The encoding speed depends on the raw
power and performance of your computer’s processor.
 Efficiency: An MPEG-2 card does all the heavy thinking about MPEG-2,
so even an older PC with an original Pentium brain can keep up.
 Convenience: Most MPEG-2 cards offer connectors so that you can plug
your TV directly into your computer and pipe your DVD movies to The
Tube. These connectors are handy little beavers to possess.
58
Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder! 

The FireWire port: The real 
information superhighway
No ifs, ands, or buts with this one: If you work with digital video recording,
you need one or two high-speed FireWire ports on your computer. Virtually
every piece of machinery on the planet that works with DV uses FireWire to
connect to everything else, including digital video camcorders and external
DVD recorders. Many high-resolution digital cameras and scanners are now
using FireWire as their connection of choice as well.
By the way, some manufacturers seem determined to call a FireWire port an 
i-LINK connection, for some reason. Heck, if you want to be perfectly accurate,
the full international title for the original FireWire standard is IEEE-1394. You
may see several of these names on the same box.
If you’re using a late-model Macintosh, you’re probably doing the Techno-
logical Twist right now, dancing in front of your monitor like a Druid partying
around Stonehenge. That’s because Apple developed FireWire, and all current
Macintosh computers include built-in FireWire ports. However, if you’re using
a PC that didn’t come graced with the Wire of Fire, be reassured that you can
party just as well by installing a PCI card in your computer. PCI cards average
about $100 on the Web, and they provide you with two FireWire ports and all
the software and drivers. You need an open PCI slot in your PC, naturally.
A new FireWire standard — called FireWire 800 or FireWire B, depending on
whom you talk to — started appearing on high-end Macintosh models in 2003.
This Speed Racer delivers twice the data of the original FireWire port, but it
hasn’t become popular yet in the PC world. Luckily, the original FireWire 400
still does the trick and is compatible with just about everything.
The digital camcorder: Your digital muse
By law (it’s written down somewhere, I know it), you can’t record digital video
without a digital camcorder (sometimes also called a DV camcorder). Note
that a DV camcorder is not the same as the VHS-C or Hi-8 camcorder that you
already own. Oh, no, things couldn’t be that simple, right? Yesterday’s typical
video camcorder records an analog signal (which doesn’t use the precise 1s
and 0s (zeros) of the digital world that we love so well), so you can’t use that
video feed with your computer and your editing software. (The next toy I show
you, however, helps you get around this problem.)
Virtually all digital camcorders download their video directly through a FireWire
port to your computer, where you can have fun with it to your heart’s content.
DV camcorders are quite a bit more expensive than their traditional analog
brethren, but they’re much more versatile: You can take still photographs with
most digital camcorders, and most models allow you to perform simple editing
59
Chapter 3: DVD Is the Cat’s Meow

jobs onboard (“Can you please get the police out of our wedding video?”)
before you download the video to your computer. For the George Lucas in
you, most digital camcorders now allow you to shoot footage in a 16:9
widescreen aspect ratio.
You now shell out anywhere from $400 to $3,000 or more for a digital cam-
corder (see Figure 3-1). For example, the Panasonic PV-DV401 sells for about
$500 online. It looks deceptively like a typical VHS-C analog camcorder, but it
sports both FireWire and USB ports and a digital camera mode for taking still
photographs. You can add special effects during recording or playback, and it
can even record in near darkness.
The A-D converter: A bridge to the past
If you’re shaking your head and mumbling, “I can’t possibly afford that kind of
cash right now for a digital camcorder,” I’ve got a card up my sleeve that may
well set things straight. This joker is called an analog-to-digital converter —
usually called an A-D converter by those who dislike $5 words. The A-D con-
verter freshens up the signal from a prehistoric analog TV, VCR, or camcorder,
and — voilà! — you’ve turned that analog signal into digital video.
Figure 3-2 shows one of the most popular A-D converters on the market, the
Hollywood DV-Bridge, from Pinnacle Systems, Inc. (www.dazzle.com). This
alchemist’s magic box costs a mere $200 or so on the Web, yet it can
 Connect your computer, your analog devices, and your DV devices in
perfect harmony with a full set of ports (including a FireWire port)
 Convert digital video to an analog signal so that you can use your VCR to
create tapes from a DV source
Figure 3-1:

60
Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder! 

 Monitor your DV feed on a TV while it’s being converted
 Mix both DV and analog material in one production
You also get two different types of Windows video-editing software. I highly
recommend the Hollywood DV-Bridge if you’re itching to try your hand at dig-
ital video, but you want to spend as little as possible and use the analog
equipment you already have.
Video-editing software
Speaking of software, I end this opening gambit in the world of DVD recording
by describing the typical software you use. In fact, two of these three programs
ship as part of the computer’s operating system. (Is DV mainstream these days
or what?)
Video-editing software now offers a basic set of tools that take care of all
common tasks, such as
 Importing and arranging video clips
 Removing unwanted footage
 Adding basic transitions between clips, like fade-ins and dissolves
 Adding and synchronizing audio

Granted, you can spend a heinous amount of money on high-end editing soft-
ware that toots your car horn and can make doughnuts, but it typically starts
at $1,000 (and that’s for the cheap seats, my friend). Most programs I cover in
this book are free or under $200, and even the commercial version of Adobe
Premiere costs less than $500 on the Web at www.adobe.com. (Chapter 13
includes coverage of iDVD and Premiere.) Other programs, like Adobe After
Effects, can add everything from a flaming hoop to a scrolling marquee
underneath the video.
Because this book is devoted to CD and DVD recording, I can’t get more than
ankle-deep in the river of DV — however, I recommend the book Digital Video
For Dummies, 3rd Edition, written by Keith Underdahl and published by Wiley
Publishing, Inc. He can have you swimming in DV in no time.

In This Chapter
 Preparing for the installation
 Installing an EIDE drive
 Adding a USB drive
 Installing a SCSI drive
 Adding a FireWire drive
 Troubleshooting installation problems
A
certain mystique surrounds today’s professional computer technicians:
Most folks think that we’re one part James Bond, one part Merlin the
Magician, and one part Barney Fife. Armed with nothing more than a pair of
taped glasses, a Phillips screwdriver, and a spare power cord, techies are
supposed to be able to work hardware miracles beyond the reach of a mere
computer owner. (The pocket protector is no longer required equipment; in
fact, I’ve never used one.)
If that nerdy stereotype is still your impression of a typical computer techni-
cian, this chapter should open your eyes — because you can be your own
tech. Sure, you can pay someone at your local computer shop to install your
new recorder, but why not save that cash and apply it to something else, like
your rent? Come to think of it, that $50 you would have paid someone can
buy you a stack of 100 blank DVD-Rs.
This chapter focuses exclusively on the installation and troubleshooting of
CD and DVD recorders — consider it the one-chapter, abridged version of my
book Building a PC For Dummies, 4th Edition (published by Wiley Publishing,
Inc.), which shows that you can assemble an entire PC from the ground up.
And yes, I cover possible solutions when the worst happens, such as when
your new drive sits there silently like a bump on a log.

Preparation Is the Key
Ever made a complex dish with a dozen ingredients without first reading the
recipe? Or how about climbing on your roof to fix a few shingles and discover
that you didn’t bring your hammer? Preparation makes all the difference when
you’re installing computer hardware as well, and in this section I describe the
things you need to cover before you get started.
Read the instructions
The steps I cover in this chapter apply to 99.9 percent of the computers and
recorders on the planet — but guess who may have bought the drive specifi-
cally designed for the other .1 percent of the population? That’s right: The
Fates may have chosen you as the person who has to cut the blue wire, not
the red wire. Certain software may need to be loaded first, or you may need
to flip switches to configure your drive correctly, which I don’t cover in these
generic procedures.
Here’s a Mark’s Maxim that actually applies to all computer hardware:
You must read the installation instructions for your recorder!™
(And yes, that includes external recorders.) If the installation process
described by the manufacturer is significantly different, follow the general
steps I provide in this chapter, and then jump ship to follow the manufac-
turer’s steps instead.
Collect what you need
No surgeon (or car mechanic) wants to operate without tools at hand, and
you should follow their lead:
 Gather the stuff you need. Most installations require just a screwdriver,
but bring your drive’s installation instructions and any extra parts.
 Prepare your work surface. If you’re installing an internal drive, prepare
a flat, soft, well-lighted surface — several sheets of newspaper on a table
work fine, or you can use an anti-static mat.
 Take your time. No one’s looking over your shoulder with a stopwatch,
so relax and follow the steps the right way the first time.
66
Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder! 

 Keep those parts. You’re likely to remove small parts, like screws and a
bay cover, when installing an internal recorder; keep a bowl handy that
can hold everything you remove. You need some of the parts when you
reassemble your computer, and anything left over should be saved as
spare parts for future upgrades and repairs.
Ask for help
Do you have a friend, loved one — in fact, anyone other than your mortal
enemy — who has installed a recorder already or who is experienced with
computer hardware? If so, buy that person a meal and ask for assistance while
you’re installing your drive. If this is your first time working on the innards of
your computer, you can probably benefit from the moral support, too.
By the way, as soon as you’ve successfully installed an internal drive, don’t
be surprised if someone you know asks for your help with a computer.
Choose a spot to be external
If you’re adding an external recorder to your computer, take a few moments
beforehand to select the right space for your new drive. The best spot
should be
 A minimum of six inches away from your computer: This space helps
minimize interference from your computer’s power supply and monitor.
 Well ventilated: An external drive can give off a significant amount of
heat, so make sure that your recorder has room on all four sides.
 Free of vibration: For example, don’t park your recorder next to your
computer’s subwoofer (that big speaker box that delivers the deep bass
for your computer’s sound system). Vibration can ruin a recording and
eventually damage your drive.
Installing an EIDE Drive
As you may have read in Chapter 2, Enhanced Integrated Drive Electronics
(EIDE) drives are internal, inexpensive, and fast — no wonder they’re the drive
of choice for most PC owners. If you’ve bought an EIDE CD or DVD recorder,
now is the time to get down to business and get your new toy installed.
67
Chapter 4: Poof! You’re a Computer Technician

What you need
First, make sure that your PC has these items:
 An unoccupied drive bay: Your drive needs a 51⁄4-inch drive bay that can
be opened to the front of your case. Most PC cases have at least two or
three of these bays (although a hard drive may be hogging one, even
though it doesn’t need an opening to the outside world).
 An unused EIDE connector with a cable: As I mention in Chapter 3, most
PCs made in the past two or three years have four available EIDE device
connectors (a primary master and slave and a secondary master and
slave). You need at least one unused connector for your new recorder.
You may also need to buy a cable if you’re using your secondary EIDE
connector because many PC manufacturers don’t provide a cable if the
connector isn’t being used.
 An unused power connector: No recorder works for long without a
power supply. An internal drive uses a connector like the one shown in
Figure 4-1. You can also buy a power splitter (or a Y connector) that can
convert one power cable into two.
The EIDE dance, step-by-step
This section covers the installation process for an EIDE drive. Follow the steps
in this section (and yes, you have to follow them in the order I show here).
Static electricity isn’t fun, it’s not amusing, and it’s not your friend: It’s the
sworn enemy of everyone who’s ever installed computer hardware. Static can
damage any electronic component in the blink of an eye, and it may not even
be easy to spot the damage until you discover that you have a dead drive on
your hands. Therefore, you must discharge any static electricity on your body
before you touch the drive, your PC’s motherboard, or any of its internal parts.
Touch a metal surface before you open your computer’s case — usually, you
can just touch the case itself — and touch the internal chassis (that’s the metal
framework) often during the installation process.

Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder! 

1. Turn off your computer and unplug it from the AC outlet.
2. Remove the screws holding your computer’s cover in place and set it
aside.
Don’t forget to put those screws in that high-tech bowl I mention earlier
in this chapter.
3. Set the EIDE drive configuration.
Every EIDE drive uses a specific configuration that allows your new
recorder to cohabitate peacefully with your existing EIDE hard drive(s)
or read-only CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive.
Setting up your recorder is not an overwhelming task, although the exact
settings for your jumpers vary between brands and models. (If you’ve
never handled a jumper, it’s the workhorse of the computer hardware
world — a tiny, metal-and-plastic crossover that allows you to make con-
nections on the drive’s circuit board.) Check your drive’s manual for the
correct set of pins, and use a pair of tweezers to add or remove jumpers
to match that pattern. If you’re working with a scavenged drive or you
don’t have the manual, check the manufacturer’s Web site or call its tech-
nical support number.
• One hard drive: Configure the jumper on the hard drive as “multi-
ple drive, master unit” and configure the jumper on your recorder
as “multiple drive, slave unit.”
• One hard drive and one CD-ROM drive on the same cable: Set the
jumper on your recorder as “single drive, master unit” and connect
it to the secondary EIDE cable. Leave the existing drives alone.
• One hard drive and one CD-ROM drive on different cables:
Configure the jumper on your recorder as “multiple drive, slave
unit” and connect it to the EIDE cable that the hard drive is using,
and then set the jumper on the hard drive to “multiple drive, master
unit.” Leave your existing read-only CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive
settings alone.
You may have to change the jumper settings on your existing EIDE devices
to get things working. For example, if you’re adding a DVD recorder on
your primary EIDE connector and you already have an EIDE hard drive
on that cable, you have to switch the hard drive from “single drive, master
unit” to “multiple drive, master unit.” In this situation, your new DVD
recorder is set to “multiple drive, slave unit.”
4. Check the bay that will hold your recorder.
If a plastic insert is covering the bay, you should be able to remove the
insert by removing the screws holding it or by carefully prying it off with
a screwdriver.
69
Chapter 4: Poof! You’re a Computer Technician

5. Align the drive into the bay and slide it into the front of the case, with
the rear of the drive (the end with the plugs and connectors) going in
first.
The faceplate and buttons should be visible from the front of the case,
as shown in Figure 4-2.
Naturally, the printing and logo on the front should be facing right side up.
6. Move the drive forward and backward until the screw holes are
aligned with the screw holes on the side of the case, and then attach
the recorder.
7. Connect a power cable to the drive and make sure that you press it in
firmly.
Notice that it goes on only one way, so don’t try to force it on backward.
8. Connect the ribbon cable coming from the EIDE connector on the
motherboard to the EIDE connector on the back of the recorder.
No need to worry about this connector either because it’s notched to fit
in only one way. Press it on firmly after it’s correctly aligned.
9. Because pulling and tugging on things inside your computer can result
in an unplugged cable, take a moment to check all your connections —
even the ones that don’t lead to your recorder.

Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder! 

10. Replace the cover on your PC with the original screws.
Did you read about that parts bowl earlier in this chapter?
11. Plug in the PC’s power cable.
12. Turn on your PC and allow it to boot up normally.
I love that phrase — like your computer will suddenly grow wings and a
tail, leap off your desk, and fly around the room like a dragon. I would
say that that would be an abnormal boot — wouldn’t you?
13. Uh-oh. I hope that you’re not superstitious and that you don’t mind my
ending on Step 13. Anyway, install the software that accompanied
your recorder.
To verify that the installation was successful, jump to Chapter 8 and try your
first recording. If things don’t fly, read the troubleshooting section at the end
of this chapter.
Plugging and Playing with a USB Drive
Made the Universal Serial Bus (USB) external choice, did you? (Hopefully, you
settled on a USB 2.0 drive, but older USB 1.1 drives are installed the same
way.) Notice that this step-by-step section is much shorter than the internal
EIDE installation in the preceding section; that’s part of the beauty (and the
popularity) of USB:
1. Plug the power cord from your new drive into the AC wall socket.
Note that some USB drives are powered through the USB connection
itself, so they don’t require an external power supply.
2. Connect the USB cable to the drive (don’t connect the cable to the
computer’s port yet) and turn it on.
3. Turn on your computer and allow it to boot up normally.
4. Plug the USB cable from your drive into the USB port on your com-
puter, as shown in Figure 4-3.
Your next step depends on the software and the operating system you’re
using: You may see a dialog box prompting you to insert the driver disc
that came with your drive, or you may have to install the drive’s soft-
ware separately.
5. Check your drive’s installation instructions to see which path you take.
71
Chapter 4: Poof! You’re a Computer Technician

That’s it. Follow the steps in Chapter 8 to record your first disc and make
sure that everything’s working well. If your drive isn’t working, visit the 
troubleshooting section at the end of this chapter.
Running the SCSI Gauntlet
Decided on an internal or external Small Computer System Interface (SCSI)
recorder? Memorize these two important commandments (add them to the
original ten):
 Thou shalt assign no two devices the same SCSI ID number.
 Thou shalt terminate the ends of your SCSI device chain.
In this section, I explain exactly what I just said — in modern English, without
technobabble — and you install your drive.

Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder! 

IDs ‘R’ Us
Think of a SCSI device chain as a neighborhood on a cable — to be precise, a
chain is at least one SCSI adapter (which may be built-in on your computer’s
motherboard) and at least one device, which could be your recorder. For your
computer to transfer data to or from your drive, it has to know the “address”
of your recorder in the SCSI neighborhood. In other words, every SCSI device
in your computer needs a unique SCSI ID number to identify it, as you can see
in Figure 4-4. This sample SCSI device chain has a SCSI card and three devices.
Typical SCSI devices can use a range of ID numbers from 0 to 7, with ID number
7 usually the default for your SCSI adapter. (Your SCSI card manual tells you
which number the card uses.) Manufacturers of SCSI hardware use different
methods of configuring the ID number; most drives use a jumper, which you
can set on the correct pins with a pair of tweezers. Again, your drive’s manual
shows you which jumpers to move when setting the ID number. Some drives
also use a thumbwheel you can turn to choose the number.
By the way, there’s no reason to assign SCSI ID numbers in sequence; as long
as all the device IDs are unique, it doesn’t matter what order they’re in.
If your SCSI adapter and your SCSI devices are all SCAM ready (man, what an
acronym!), you can forget about assigning numbers manually. That’s because
SCAM stands for SCSI Configured Automatically. Enabling this feature on your
SCSI adapter allows it to automatically set SCSI ID numbers each time you
boot your PC.
Coming to grips with termination
No, I’m not talking about the Flintstones kind of termination, where Fred ends
up without a job (again). In the SCSI world, a chain must be correctly termi-
nated on each end to tell your SCSI adapter where the chain ends. Without
termination, your poor SCSI adapter continues to scan the horizon in vain,
looking for straggling SCSI devices that aren’t there — and your computer
either locks up or fails to recognize the last device on the chain. If the termi-
nation is set on a device that isn’t on the end of the chain, it becomes the end

SCSI ID: 3

SCSI card
CDRW drive
Figure 4-4:

73
Chapter 4: Poof! You’re a Computer Technician

anyway, which again leaves at least one SCSI device out in the cold; it either
refuses to work or locks your computer. In short, without proper termination,
you never get your SCSI devices to work.
Consider the simplest installation of a CD or DVD recorder on a SCSI chain.
As you can see in Figure 4-5, this is just the SCSI adapter and the drive, and
the drive could be internal or external. Both these devices naturally indicate
the ends of the SCSI chain, so both need to be terminated. When your SCSI
adapter looks for terminators, it finds that one device is on one end and the
card itself is terminated on the other.
However, what if you want to install an internal recorder into an existing SCSI
chain that already has a hard drive? If no changes are made and you just
added your spiffy new CD-RW drive to the end of the cable, you would invite
the disaster shown in Figure 4-6. Because the hard drive is still terminated,
your new toy is useless, and it can’t even be recognized within Windows or
the Mac operating system.
For this reason, heed this Mark’s Maxim carefully:
Always review all your termination settings when installing SCSI or
adding a new device to an existing chain.™
Figure 4-7 shows how the same chain should be terminated. Now the SCSI
adapter can “see” and communicate with the recorder, and all is well.

Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder! 

Depending on the manufacturer, setting the SCSI termination usually involves
your old friends the Jumper family. You may also encounter a resistor pack,
which you plug in to add termination and remove to drop termination. Finally,
you may set termination by flipping the tiny plastic switches on a DIP switch (a
tiny switchbox that’s wired as part of the circuit board) — use a pencil to set
the correct pattern of switches to either On or Off. Again, all these interesting
settings appear in your recorder’s manual, so keep it handy during the instal-
lation process.
What you need
If you’re installing an internal SCSI recorder, you need these items:
 An open drive bay: Look for a 51⁄4-inch drive bay that’s accessible from
the front of your case.
 A SCSI connector: Your SCSI adapter should come with a cable, and you
should use the first open connector that’s closest to the SCSI adapter. If
you’re adding a drive to an existing chain, select the next open connec-
tor on the cable after the last existing device.
I’ve always recommended this technique of adding devices to the end 
of the cable (instead of trying to stick them in the middle of a SCSI chain).
Why? You have less to worry about come termination time; you simply
remove the termination on the last existing device on the cable and 
make sure that your new device is terminated. Because it’s now the last
device on the cable, you always know that it marks the end of the chain.
Sometimes, this process isn’t possible (for example, if you have only one
open drive bay and the end of the SCSI cable doesn’t reach it), but when-
ever you can, adding devices at the end of the cable is a good idea.
 An open power connector: Most PCs come with a veritable forest of
available power connectors. If you’ve used them all, buy a Y connector
that splits one power cable into two. ’Nuff said.

Chapter 4: Poof! You’re a Computer Technician

Your step-by-step guide to 
internal SCSI happiness
Ready to dive in? Follow these steps:
1. Turn off your computer and unplug it from the AC outlet.
2. Touch a metal surface to dissipate any static electricity that may be
stowed away on your person.
Usually, your PC’s case suffices just fine.
3. Remove the screws holding your computer’s cover and place it out of
harm’s way.
Put the removed screws in your parts bowl.
4. Set the SCSI device ID on your drive to a unique number.
Refer to the drive’s manual to determine where the ID control is located,
and then configure it with a unique number that’s not used on any other
SCSI device in your system.
5. Determine the correct termination — don’t forget that the correct ter-
mination includes all existing SCSI devices on the chain.
Check the position of the SCSI connector you want to use. If the recorder
is on the end of your SCSI cable, make sure that the device is terminated
(and all intervening devices have had their termination removed).
6. If necessary, remove the plastic insert covering the drive bay.
If the cover is the snap-on type, you can carefully pry it off with a 
screwdriver.
7. Slide the drive into the front of the case, with the rear of the drive
(the end with the plugs and connectors) going in first.
The tray and buttons should be facing the front of the case, as shown in
Figure 4-2, and any printing or logos on the front should be facing right
side up.
8. Move the drive forward and backward to align the screw holes on the
side of the drive and the case, and then attach the recorder with the
manufacturer’s screws.
9. Connect a power cable to the drive and make sure that you press it in
firmly.
10. Connect the SCSI ribbon cable to the SCSI connector on the back of
the recorder.
Note that it’s notched to fit only one way. Press it on firmly after it’s cor-
rectly aligned.
76
Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder! 

11. Take a moment to check all your power and cable connections — even
the ones that don’t lead to your recorder.
12. Replace the cover on your PC with the original screws.
13. Plug in the PC’s power cable.
14. Turn on your PC and allow it to boot up normally.
You should see the SCSI adapter verifying each of the devices on the
chain, including your new recorder.
15. Install the software that accompanied your recorder.
Sweet! It’s time to test things out by taking a quick detour to Chapter 8. If you
can’t record, remain calm and turn to the troubleshooting section at the end
of this chapter.
External SCSI stuff
Like USB and FireWire external drives, an external SCSI recorder carries its
house along with it — however, you still have to select a unique SCSI ID and
correctly terminate that external recorder before everything starts humming.
Use your SCSI adapter’s external SCSI port to connect your recorder. A
number of different SCSI port configurations are possible, so if your card
didn’t come with a cable, make sure that you’re buying the right type with
the right connections.
All external SCSI devices come with two connectors, so you can add more
than one external device with additional cables — a classic example is a SCSI
system with an external SCSI recorder and a SCSI scanner. The same termina-
tion rules you followed for internal drives apply when you’re installing multi-
ple external SCSI devices. As shown in Figure 4-8, make sure to terminate the
last external device in the chain.

Chapter 4: Poof! You’re a Computer Technician

Remember that your SCSI adapter should never be terminated if you’ve con-
nected both internal and external SCSI devices (in fact, it’s now at the center
of your chain).
Installing a FireWire Drive
Like USB, the data superhighway that is FireWire makes the installation of your
external recorder an easy process. Granted, producing microwave popcorn 
is easier, but everyone can do that, and it doesn’t sound nearly as impressive
for the uninitiated. (Remember, let others think this stuff is complex . . . techno-
types have been doing it for decades now.)
Anyway, follow these steps to install your FireWire drive:
1. Plug the power cord from your recorder into the AC wall socket.
2. Connect the FireWire cable to the drive and turn it on.
3. Plug the cable from your drive into the FireWire port on your computer.
4. Turn on your computer and allow it to boot up normally.
Your next step depends on the software and the operating system you’re
using. You may see a dialog box prompting you to insert the driver disc
that came with your drive, or you may have to install the drive’s soft-
ware separately.
5. Check your drive’s installation instructions to see which path you take.
To double-check your work, rush to Chapter 8 and try burning your first disc.
If your drive appears to be suffering from rigor mortis, jump to the following
troubleshooting section.
“Um, It’s Just Sitting There”
I really hope that you’re not reading this — I hope that your recorder went in
as smooth as butter, lit up like a Christmas tree when you turned things on,
and perfectly burned that first disc of Liberace tunes. Therefore, I assume
that you’re skipping this section completely. Or, perhaps you’ve reached this
section and you’re just curious about what could have happened, or you’re
generally interested in troubleshooting (the art of figuring out what’s wrong
with your computer and how you can fix it).
78
Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder! 

On the other hand, you may have reached this section with a hunk of hardware
that’s just sitting there like a dead weight. If so, these sentences are pure gold
because they can help you diagnose the problem with your recorder installa-
tion and solve it quickly.
EIDE troubleshooting
If you’ve installed an EIDE drive and it appears to be acting persnickety, here
are the problems that folks often encounter and how to solve them.
The drive doesn’t eject the tray, and the power light doesn’t turn on.
This problem is usually caused by an unplugged, loose, or broken power con-
nector. Unfortunately, this means that it’s time to crack open your PC’s case
and check your connections.
I tried to play an audio CD with my recorder, and I can’t hear any music.
This problem is common and easy to fix: You forgot to connect the Audio Out
cable from the recorder to your PC’s sound card. The manufacturer of your
drive should provide this cable (and it’s often also supplied along with a
sound card). Consult the manual for your sound card to determine where
you should plug in the Audio Out cable from your new drive.
My drive ejects the tray, but I can’t find the drive symbol in Windows, and
my software says that it can’t recognize the recorder.
The simplest explanation for this problem is an unplugged data cable. Check to
make sure that you’ve plugged firmly into the drive the flat ribbon cable from
the EIDE connector. Next, you may have the master and slave jumpers on your
recorder configured incorrectly, so check them against the configurations
listed in the recorder’s manual. Finally — and this is the tricky one — you may
have set the jumpers on the recorder correctly, but forgotten to configure the
new multiple drive setting on the drive that’s already on that EIDE cable.
SCSI troubleshooting
I think that even Scotty on the original Star Trek TV series would have thought
twice before sticking one of those silver penlights into a recalcitrant SCSI setup.
Just kidding. Although you have more to troubleshoot with a SCSI installation,
all it takes to solve a problem is time and patience.
79
Chapter 4: Poof! You’re a Computer Technician

My computer locks up every time I boot after the installation, and I have to
turn it off manually.
I bet that you already suspect that your SCSI termination or ID numbers are
configured wrong — and if so, you’re right. Double check all your termination
settings and make sure that they’re correct, and then verify that each SCSI
device on your chain has a unique SCSI ID number.
I can’t get my SCSI drive to eject the tray, and the power light doesn’t turn on.
On an internal drive, check your power cable — if you’ve added an external
SCSI drive, the external power supply is the likely culprit.
The drive ejects the tray, but my computer acts like the recorder isn’t there.
(Alternatively, the recorder works, but my existing SCSI scanner is now
broken.)
Poke your drive with a finger to make sure that it’s there. (Sorry, I couldn’t
resist that one.) The real problem is likely your old friends: two or more
devices trying to share the same SCSI ID number, or termination that’s incor-
rectly configured for your new drive. Also, make sure that all other SCSI
devices on the chain are powered up and connected, and wiggle your data
cable to make sure that it’s firmly connected.
If your SCSI adapter card came with any SCSI diagnostics programs, run them
now and see what error messages the programs display. Also, check your
SCSI adapter manual to see whether you can run a self-test mode.
USB and FireWire troubleshooting
Although both USB and FireWire are Plug and Play (meaning that you can
simply connect and disconnect them without rebooting your computer), that
doesn’t mean that they’re trouble-free. If your external recorder isn’t working,
check these possible solutions:
My computer complains that it doesn’t have a “USB (or FireWire) device
driver” when I plug in my recorder.
This message is a clear cry for help from your computer: You either need to
install the manufacturer’s driver from the disc or the driver you installed has
been corrupted. To fix this problem, reinstall the recorder’s software. Checking
the manufacturer’s Web site to see whether an updated USB driver is available
is a good idea. If you’re using a Macintosh computer under Mac OS 9.2 and a
FireWire recorder, you should check your Extensions list for the device’s
80
Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder! 

FireWire extension. To check your Extensions list, click the Apple icon in the
Finder menu, and select the Extensions Manager from the Control Panel list.
(Mac owners running Mac OS X don’t have to worry about extensions.)
My recorder has no power; the tray doesn’t eject and, and no power light
turns on.
Your first thought is probably the drive’s power supply, and if it does have an
external power supply, you’re likely right. If you bought your drive locally,
take it to the salesperson and ask that person to check it out with another
supply. However, if your USB drive is designed to be powered from the com-
puter’s USB port, it doesn’t have a separate power supply. In this case, the
port is probably not providing enough power to meet the USB standard. (This
problem happens frequently with USB hubs and keyboard and/or auxiliary
USB ports.) Plug your recorder into another computer’s USB port and see
whether it jumps into action.
My drive has power, but my computer doesn’t recognize it.
If the recorder’s software installation ran without a hitch and the driver is
present, this problem is usually caused by a faulty cable, a faulty USB or
FireWire hub, or a USB cable that’s too long (it shouldn’t be more than 10
feet). Try connecting your drive to your computer with a different standard
cable and without an intervening hub. Most USB and FireWire devices don’t
pass a signal when they’re turned off, either — this can cause any daisy-
chained peripherals that may be connected to suddenly go silent as well.
Make sure that all the external devices that connect your recorder to your
computer are turned on.

ardware. Are you up to your gills in it? I devote the entire first portion
of this book to describing your CD or DVD recorder, buying it, and
installing it. Sure, I admit that your drive is the most important part of your
computer-based Optical Recording Studio (or ORS), but does it run itself?
Can it do anything by itself besides blink a light or two and stick out its tray?
The answer, of course, is a big, fat No. You need software to tame your
recording beast. It’s like Santa at the North Pole: The old guy gets all the
credit, and his elves are constantly toiling behind the scenes all year-round
while he’s watching marathon reruns of The Andy Griffith Show and eating
leftover popcorn balls. Without the elves, who would load the sleigh, make
the toys, and feed the reindeer? Not to mention the work that Mrs. Claus
must be doing to keep everyone fed and clothed. (Sorry, I tend to get a little
carried away — I have three kids.)
In this chapter, doggone it, I change all that. I cover the highlights and special
talents of each elf — whoops, I mean program — that I use in this book. This
information comes in handy if you’re considering a shareware or commercial
recording package to replace the lame program that came with your recorder.
If you decide to buy a different program from the favorites I recommend in
this chapter (insert look of shock and chagrin here), make sure that the pro-
gram you’re buying has at least most of these primo features.

The Windows Tool of Choice: Roxio’s 
Easy CD & DVD Creator 6
For PC owners running Windows, the choice is clear: Easy CD & DVD Creator 6
(which I call Creator 6, for short) from Roxio (www.roxio.com). This show-
piece has been the solid, reliable Swiss army knife of CD and DVD burning for
many years. It has the widest range of features of any recording software I’ve
ever used in my travels, it can burn a host of different formats and disc types,
and it’s simple enough for a novice to use. (See Figure 5-1.)
Formats and disc types out the wazoo
If you’re likely to need just about any specific type of disc on planet Earth,
this program can do it. Of course, Creator 6 can burn simple data discs and
audio CDs using Track-at-Once or Disc-at-Once without even lifting an eye-
brow, but it can also pump out
 CD-ROM XA (multisession) discs
 DVD-Video discs
 Video CDs
 Mixed-mode discs
 CD Extra discs
 Photo slideshow discs
This lineup also includes two types of discs that both deserve special atten-
tion: the bootable CD-ROM and the MP3 music disc. As you may have already
guessed, you can boot most PCs by using a bootable CD-ROM, so you can even
run your PC without a hard drive — after a fashion, anyway. A bootable disc
can also carry other programs and data besides a basic operating system. A
Microsoft Windows XP CD-ROM is a good example of a bootable CD: It uses DOS
as a basic operating system to display simple prompts, but after your computer
is up and running, you can install Windows from it and really screw up your
system. (Sorry, Mr. Gates, I didn’t mean that. Please don’t pull the plug.)
An MP3 music disc, on the other hand, is a specialized data CD-ROM. Although
it carries music in MP3 (MPEG Audio Layer 3) format, its songs are not recorded
in the Red Book digital audio format (refer to Chapter 2), so you can’t play the
disc in an older audio CD player. MP3 discs are meant to be played exclusively
on either your computer, using a program like Winamp, or on specially designed
MP3 CD players. (Many of the current crop of audio CD players now support
MP3 music discs; check your player’s manual to see whether your model can
use them.) You find more on MP3 music discs in Chapter 7 — these CDs are
called MP3 player discs in Creator 6.
86
Part II: It’s All in the Preparation 

Wolfgang woulda loved this
Interested in burning hot music on a compact disc? Whether those songs are
in MP3 format or stored on older cassettes and vinyl albums or you’re collect-
ing tracks from a number of existing audio CDs, Creator 6 can do it in style.
Although I’ve tried many different programs that record audio CDs, Creator
Classic (the primary recording application included with Easy CD & DVD
Creator 6) continues to be my favorite: It’s the easiest to understand and the
fastest to use. On the audio side, the program can
 Automatically convert songs in MP3 and WMA (Windows Media Audio)
formats and prepare them for recording
 Extract tracks from existing audio CDs and save them as MP3 files on
your hard drive
 Store CD text for display on many CD players with digital readouts
 Add transition effects, like fade in, fade out, and cross fading
 Preview WAV and MP3 songs before you record them
I especially like how Creator Classic can venture onto the Internet — it can
check online music databases and download all the track names for CDs it

finds. This feature can save you both time and sore fingers because you avoid
typing all those track names by hand.
Extra stuff they give you 
(without even asking)
If the Creator 6 feature list ended in the preceding section, most folks would
be satisfied. But, wait — what if I told you that you also get these great stand-
alone (separate) programs to boot?
CD Copier
CD Copier makes it easy to produce a duplicate of an existing data CD, data
DVD, or audio CD (without requiring you to start Creator 6 and produce a disc
image, which is a much longer process that accomplishes the same thing).
Folks who date back to the glory days of floppies should remember programs
that allowed you to copy a disk read from one drive to another. If you have
both a read-only CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive and a recorder in the same PC,
you can use the read-only drive as the source (as I’m doing in Figure 5-2). No
swapping required. If you have only a recorder, however, you can still use CD
Copier — you just have to eject the original disc and load a blank.
I show you how to use CD Copier in Chapter 8.

Roxio Retrieve
How many times in this book do I harp about backing up your hard drive?
Would you mind losing every file you’ve ever known if your hard drive
crashes? If you don’t have a current backup, I’ll nag you like your mother
until you make one. (There’s a scary thought, eh?)
With the combination of Creator Classic and Roxio Retrieve (see Figure 5-3),
you no longer have any excuse. It can back up a drive to multiple CD-RWs as
fast as your drive can shovel 1s and 0s (zeros).
Chapter 8 includes the steps for a typical hard drive backup.
AudioCentral
AudioCentral is an exciting program for anyone interested in recording music:
You can copy your favorite old cassettes and albums to audio CDs. Those of
us with extensive piles of vinyl and tape still occupying the corners of a room
know the heartbreak of losing an old favorite that hasn’t been released in com-
pact disc format. Scratches and stretched tape can ruin your treasures, but
after you use AudioCentral to transfer them to CD, you can keep them for their
cover art. The program can also play your digital audio files and includes an
editor that can modify tracks before you burn them to disc. (See Figure 5-4.)
I show you in Chapter 11 how to transfer that “H.R. Puffinstuff” soundtrack
album to CD.

Label Creator
Let me be honest: I like a labeled disc, but I don’t label everything I burn. For
example, if I’m going on a business trip and I’ve just recorded a disc of mater-
ial for a book I’m writing, I don’t go to the trouble of printing a label — I just
use my trusty CD/DVD-marking pen and write a short title right on the disc.
On the other hand, Label Creator (shown in Figure 5-5) is the program you
want to use when a disc needs to look its best — if you’re giving it to some-
one else or you’re particularly proud of that DVD-Video disc you made at your
cousin’s wedding. The program can also produce front and back jewel box
inserts and DVD box inserts, with classy clip art, photographs, and different
fonts. You can even choose one of the themes that’s already set up in the pro-
gram, which can produce a matching set with a label and a complete set of
inserts. Neat!

Burning Up Your Macintosh with 
Roxio’s Toast 6 Titanium
As you can see from Figure 5-6, those Mac folks look different again: This
time, it’s Toast 6 Titanium, from Roxio, the king of recording programs on the
Macintosh. (Don’t ask how the program got its name — I’m sure that a funny
story is in there, but I don’t know it.)
Besides the standard formats — audio, data, mixed-mode, Video CD, and CD
Extra — that we all expect, Toast 6 can produce a couple of nifty extras:

 Hybrid discs: These strange beasts can be read under both Windows
and the Mac operating system — they’re often used for cross-platform
applications that have both a Mac and Windows version. Games are
often shipped on hybrid discs for the same reason.
 Super Video CD: Also called SVCDs for short, Super Video CDs can store
digital video files just like standard Video CDs. As the name suggests, how-
ever, Super Video CDs provide significantly better video quality (at the
expense of disc space, so SVCDs typically hold only about 45 minutes 
of video). Standard Video CDs can usually store up to 60 minutes of 
digital video.
 MP3 music discs: As I discuss in earlier chapters, these discs store music
files in MP3 format.
 DVDs: Toast can burn both DVD data and DVD-Video discs on supported
drives.
If you’re burning discs for older Mac operating systems, you can use the Mac
standard format. However, if your disc is used on a newer machine running
Mac OS 9.0 or later, you should use the enhanced Mac OS Extended mode.
As any Mac technotype can tell you, the Mac operating system can mount a
disk image as a virtual drive on your desktop. Toast can both create and mount
these images for you, so you can store multiple images on a single CD or DVD
and use them rather than hunt for a physical disc. (I leap headlong into the
subject of disc images in Chapter 8.) I also like the Compare feature in Toast,
where you can compare two folders or files and view the differences — usually
one folder or file on your hard drive and another on a CD or DVD disc.
Chapter 9 is devoted to burning with Toast. (I’m sorry — that one just slipped
in subconsciously.)

Packet Writing Made Easy 
with Drag-to-Disc
Packet writing is almost as foolproof as a burnproof recording: You simply
format the disc, write to it just like it’s a huge floppy or Zip disk, and then
finalize it for reading just like an ordinary CD-ROM or DVD-ROM. Teamed with
a CD-RW or DVD rewriteable drive, packet writing software can produce the
nearly perfect, reusable, low-cost storage solution that everyone has been
chasing since the first 1GB hard drive appeared way back when. Figure 5-7
illustrates the Roxio Drag-to-Disc hard at work.
You can find a complete rundown on Drag-to-Disc in Chapter 10.
Introducing the Editors: iMovie 3, 
iDVD, and Premiere
Not one of these three programs counts as true disc-recording software:
Instead, they’re programs for digital video editing, disc design, and the cre-
ation of special effects that just happen to have recording features built-in.
(As you can tell, these programs cross a number of boundaries when it
comes to genre.) Because I use them later in this book, however, I thought
that I would introduce at least a little something about each one here.

Chapter 5: Letting Loose the Software Elves

iMovie 3, as shown in Figure 5-8, was a groundbreaking arrival for both Apple
and the world of digital video. iMovie marked a revolution where practically
anyone who could connect a FireWire cable, drag and drop video clips, and
select a transition or two could develop their own professional-looking movies.
For the first time, you didn’t need several hundred dollars to spend just on
editing software. The software has been shipping free with iMacs since the pro-
gram was first introduced. iMovie was simple enough to appeal to novices, who
definitely didn’t want to spend hours understanding the basics of a more pow-
erful, traditional editor. Unfortunately for Windows folks, iMovie 3 runs on only
Mac OS X. However, Windows Movie Maker is very much like it.
iDVD 3 is the recently released big brother to iMovie 3: At the time I wrote
this book, it was available only on Macintosh computers that offer the CD-RW/
DVD-R SuperDrive. With iDVD, you can master your own DVD-ROM titles,
complete with basic menu and submenu interaction. For example, viewers
can select a video clip to watch or view a slideshow of digital photographs.
While designing your disc, you can use a prepared theme to automatically set
the appearance of your buttons and background, or you can add your own.
Finally, iDVD allows you to preview your work and burn the DVD within the
program itself. Figure 5-9 shows iDVD in action. (For more detail on iDVD,
check out Chapter 13.)

The excellent Adobe digital video editor Premiere Pro (as shown in Figure
5-10) is available for Windows. Premiere is much more powerful than either
iMovie 3 or iDVD 3, offering professional special effects, better control over
audio and timing, output as streaming Web video, storyboarding, and the
ability to handle more formats of digital video. However, it’s not anywhere
near as simple to use as iMovie 3 or iDVD 3. Because it’s a commercial pro-
gram, you’re likely to spend around $500 or so for a copy. Premiere is the
right choice for those folks who know that they’re in digital video to stay,
want to grow into a professional package, and want its tight integration with
other Adobe products, like After Effects.

Chapter 6
Fine-Tuning Can Be Fun
In This Chapter
 Reclaiming space on your hard drive
 Checking for hard drive errors
 Defragmenting your hard drive
 Disabling programs that can ruin a recording
 Fine-tuning Windows and Mac OS for better recording
I
n the beginning, there were Windows 3.1 and the 486 processor, and many
did try to record their first CD-ROMs and fell by the wayside. For Buffer
Underruns roamed the land, ruining those early discs because the computer
could not keep up with the recorder. And many threw up their hands in anger
and frustration, and they knew then that they must optimize their systems.”
Such tales are few and far between these days because you’re likely using a
PC or Macintosh that performs much better than the 486-based computers of
old. The latest hard drives can deliver data much faster than a recorder can
burn it, and today’s burnproof recorders no longer fear multitasking and disk-
intensive applications. So why do I dedicate a chapter to optimization and
fine-tuning? I have two important reasons (besides the fact that I needed a
topic for Chapter 6).
First, you may not be lucky enough to own only the cutting edge in hardware.
I own and use seven computers, and only one of them is state-of-the-art
(meaning that it’s less than a year old). If both your computer and your drive
have been hanging around for three years or more, optimization is just as
important as ever.
Second, optimization helps your entire system run like the Six Million Dollar
Man: better, faster, and farther. I recommend many of these steps even if your
computer doesn’t sport a CD or DVD recorder right now — you’ll thank me
the next time you open Microsoft Word or Adobe Photoshop.
Therefore, this chapter is designed to help you tinker and tune. Just hand me
a wrench and the proper screwdriver from time to time, and your computer
will soon be running at its best.

Creating Elbowroom
No matter how you cut it, 700MB of data takes up a fair chunk of hard drive
territory — and that’s just what you store on a CD-R or CD-RW. As you may
have read in earlier chapters, a DVD-R or DVD+R can hold 4.7GB, and a
double-sided DVD-RAM can store as much as 9.4GB! You can see how hard
drive space can become important very quickly, and there never seems to be
enough. You find that your data expands to fill your drive, whatever the size
(rather like The Blob). In this section, I cover a number of tips and tricks that
can help you clear space for your next burning session.
’Course, you could just buy 
a bigger hard drive
Although a bigger hard drive is the likely option for the fine folks living in the
Gates mansion, I bet that you would rather conserve space, reduce clutter,
and just keep your current drive. Besides the space you need in order to tem-
porarily store the data or audio you want to record, two other important tem-
porary files take up space behind the scenes:
 Temp files used by your recording software: If you’re recording in Disc-
at-Once mode, for example, your software is likely to create a temporary
image file of the entire disc — this process typically takes as much space
as the data itself!
 Virtual memory: All versions of Windows (as well as Mac OS 9.2 and
Mac OS X) use territory on your hard drive as virtual memory, which is
storage space for all those 1s and 0s (zeros) that don’t fit into the physi-
cal RAM installed in your system. (Ever wonder how a computer with
64MB of RAM can run a 10MB program that opens 256MB files? That’s
virtual memory at work.) Figure 6-1 shows how limited your system
becomes if virtual memory is disabled. I talk more about virtual memory
throughout the rest of this chapter.
As you may have guessed from the word temporary, these files are deleted
after the recording has finished or the additional virtual memory space is no
longer needed. (Insert ominous chord here.) However, good people, not all
programs are as tidy in cleaning up behind themselves. Shame!

Part II: It’s All in the Preparation 

Locate unnecessary stuff
If you’ve ever deleted programs and data files manually from your computer,
you know that you’re waltzing in a potential minefield, and you’re a prime
candidate for this important Mark’s Maxim:
Never, never — never — delete files willy-nilly!™
(By the way, “willy-nilly” is a non-technical term for opening Windows Explorer
and simply deleting an entire folder.) Luckily, programs that are both built into
your operating system and available separately at your neighborhood computer
store can help you remove accumulated hard drive crud safely.
First, though, here’s a rundown of which files you can likely kiss goodbye
without sending your computer into a coma:
 Demos, samples, and Aunt Harriet’s fruitcake recipe: First things first:
Get rid of those 10-year-old game demos and one-shot software installa-
tions that you’ll never need again! Naturally, you should drag whatever
unnecessary documents you have created to the Recycle Bin or Trash —
I mean, how many Top Ten joke listings should you save? Anyway, after
you decide what to trash, choose Start➪Settings➪Control Panel➪Add/
Remove Programs to display the dialog box shown in Figure 6-2. (You
should always use this method to delete an entire program under
Windows!) Click the program you want to delete from the list and select
Remove to start things moving.

 The contents of your Trash or Recycle Bin: Hey, you didn’t want these
files anyway, and they already have one foot in the Great Beyond! To
clear the space under Windows, right-click the Recycle Bin icon and select
Empty Recycle Bin. Under Mac OS 9.2, click the Special menu and choose
Empty Trash; under Mac OS X, click Finder and choose Empty Trash.
 TBR: That’s an acronym of my own — I guess I just snapped from all
these silly technobabble terms. It stands for typical browser refuse: the
images, Web pages, and sound files your browser stores in its cache to
speed things up when you reload a page. Luckily, shoveling this stuff out
the door is easy because both Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator
allow you to purge their cache directories. (In Internet Explorer, choose
Tools➪Internet Options, click the Delete Files button, and click OK to
confirm that you want to sweep up the place.) If you’re a big-time Web
walker, you may be surprised at the sheer amount of space you can
reclaim!
Let the wizard do it!
Fans of J.R.R. Tolkien’s classic The Hobbit will agree: Dwarves would much
rather leave the heavy work to the burglar or the wizard! If your system is
running Windows 98 or later, you can turn to the Disk Cleanup Wizard to help
you automate the removal of accumulated disk gunk.

Call in the professionals
I heartily recommend two commercial programs that can help you clean up
either a PC running Windows or a Macintosh running Mac OS 9.2/Mac OS X.
Figure 6-4 illustrates Norton CleanSweep for the PC, from Symantec (www.
symantec.com) — it offers a high level of safety. I especially like the feature
that locates and deletes temporary, zero-length, and duplicate files that can
nibble at your free space.

grams to zapping browser cache files.
Checking under the Rug
Your computer may be hiding something from you: No, not a winning lottery
ticket or a love affair with a coffee machine, but rather nasty errors on your
hard drive that may be robbing you of both free space and performance. If you
don’t look for these errors, I can guarantee that they won’t leap up and iden-
tify themselves (except, of course, those errors that continue to grow worse
and eventually cause you to lose files and data permanently). Before you burn
a disc — or, for that matter, once every couple of days — running your com-
puter’s disk diagnostics program takes care of anything hiding under the rug.
These errors fall into two categories:
 Logical errors: These are the most common file problems, and they’re
usually caused by improper shutdowns, power outages, and misbehaving
programs. If you have already encountered lost clusters and cross-linked
files, you have already met (and hopefully fixed) logical errors on your
hard drive. Most logical errors can be solved with the right software.
 Physical errors: These errors, on the other hand, are caused by a mal-
function in the hard drive itself. The classic cause of physical errors is
the infamous and frightening hard drive crash, where either your entire
drive croaks or the magnetic platters inside are damaged. Physical
errors usually can’t be corrected by the layman: If you’re willing to
spend a rather unbelievable amount of money, some companies can fix
the innards of your hard drive, but in most cases it’s simply not worth
the effort. Therefore, if your drive is acting up and returning physical
errors, I strongly recommend that you back up now — this second! —
and buy a replacement drive.

Fixing your drive the Windows way
Checking a drive under Windows 98 and Windows Me is child’s play, thanks
to a program named ScanDisk; using it at least once a day to fix any logical
errors that may appear on your drive is a good idea. Follow these steps to
put ScanDisk through its paces:
1. Choose Start➪Programs➪Accessories➪System Tools➪ScanDisk.
2. Use the drop-down list box to select the hard drive you want to scan.
3. Select the Standard radio button to check for logical errors, or select
the Thorough radio button to check for both logical and physical
errors.
Be prepared for a long haul if you choose Thorough, especially on
today’s huge hard drives.
4. Click Start to begin the scanning process.
5. After the disk has been checked and any logical errors squashed,
ScanDisk displays the results.
6. Click Close to return to Windows and your work.
Under Windows 2000 and Windows XP, ScanDisk has been integrated into
the operating system, so you can check a disk for errors from the drive’s
Properties dialog box. Follow these steps:
1. Double-click the My Computer icon on your desktop.
2. Right-click the icon for the hard drive that you want to scan and
choose Properties from the pop-up menu that appears.
3. Click the Tools tab to display the panel shown in Figure 6-5.
4. Click the Check Now button to display the Check dialog box.
5. Enable the Automatically Fix File System Errors check box.
6. For a full scan, select the Scan For and Attempt Recovery of Bad
Sectors check box to check for both logical and physical errors.
Because a full scan takes so much longer, I only perform bad sector test-
ing every six months or so. Otherwise, I leave the Scan For and Attempt
Recovery of Bad Sectors check box disabled.

Windows and the Macintosh.
Avoiding Fragments
It’s time to cover another insidious problem that can rob your computer of
the performance you need for recording: hard drive fragmentation. Geez, more
buzzwords.
I could get into a convoluted description of sectors, files, and your computer’s
operating system — but this is a For Dummies book, so I distill all that hoorah
into a sidebar. If you’re interested about what you’re doing and why fragmenta-
tion occurs, read a little more. Otherwise, just remember this important truth:
Defragmenting your hard drive is A Good Thing to do once a month or so, and
it speeds up the overall performance of your computer (including, naturally,
your recording projects).
106
Part II: It’s All in the Preparation 
Defragmenting For Dummies
No matter how cool I think defragmenting is, I
just don’t have enough material to write a For
Dummies book about it. I know for sure because
I pitched that book proposal to the publisher
before I wrote this book. So, consider this side-
bar your personal copy of Defragmenting For
Dummies (definitely the shortest book in the
famous series). It has no table of contents, no
Part of Tens, no index, and not a single figure or
table — but I do tell you what’s happening
behind the curtain.
Why do files fragment? Well, when you delete
and move files from your computer, you open
areas on your hard drive for new files. However,
these open areas aren’t always big enough to
hold a new file in one piece, so your computer
and hard drive work together to save files in
pieces called segments. For example, if you’re

Windows 98/Me, Windows 2000, and Windows XP all come with a defragment-
ing program named (strangely enough) Disk Defragmenter, but Mac OS 9.2
and Mac OS X don’t have a defragmenting program. Mac owners, I feel your
pain, and I recommend using a commercial program like Speed Disk (another
part of Norton Utilities, from Symantec), which works under both Mac OS 9.2
and Mac OS X.
Therefore, here are the steps for defragmenting your drive under Windows XP:
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪Accessories➪System Tools➪Disk
Defragmenter.
2. Disk Defragmenter displays the window shown in Figure 6-8. Click the
target drive in the list to select it.
Do you have more than one hard drive? If so, defragmenting all of them
is a good idea (especially if you want to record files from multiple loca-
tions). If you’re pressed for time, however, always pick Drive C because
it usually holds both Windows and your virtual memory swap file.
3. Click Defragment to begin the defragmentation process.
You can continue to work on other things, but defragmenting takes
much less time if you can leave your PC to its own devices. (For this
reason, I always defragment during the night, when I’m generally not
using my computers.)
107
Chapter 6: Fine-Tuning Can Be Fun
copying a 200MB video clip to your hard drive
so that you can record it later, your drive may
not have 200MB worth of contiguous, unbroken
open space on it — that’s when the file is
broken up into segments. Perhaps 20MB can fit
in one place on your disk, and 100MB can fit in
another, and so on. When the time comes to
read the file, Windows or Mac OS X automati-
cally and invisibly reassembles it and sends it to
the proper place. All is well, right?
It is until your drive becomes badly fragmented
and little chunks of thousands of different files
are spread across the surface of your hard
drive! If a file is saved as a contiguous whole,
your drive can read it efficiently and quickly. 
On the other hand, it takes a significantly longer
time for Windows or the Mac operating system
to rebuild a file that’s made up of dozens of seg-
ments in several different locations. We humans
see this lag time in the form of decreased per-
formance and a delay of a second or two. When
you’re burning a disc, however (especially on
an older computer with a fast CD or DVD
recorder), that drop in performance can result
in a coaster. Scratch another disc unless you’re
using a burnproof drive.
You can solve this problem by running your
defragmenting program. This slick piece of soft-
ware reads each file on your disk, combines the
segments to form a contiguous file, and then
saves the reassembled file back to disk in one
piece. Plus, most defragmenting programs can
also rearrange the locations of your files so that
the programs and data you use most often load
the fastest. When the program is finished, your
hard drive is a smooth, efficient vista — a stor-
age wonderland. (I think perhaps I need to stop
now before I wax too enthusiastic.)

Avoiding the Unexpected
“Okay, Mark, how am I supposed to predict the unpredictable?” Good point —
I don’t mean the really unexpected things in life, like a hard drive crash or an
honest politician. Instead, I’m talking about that doggone screen saver that
pops up while you’re burning or that silly guy in the next office who bothers
you with constant network messages. Things like these are also unexpected,
and they can easily trash a disc.
In this section, I talk about a number of automatic features and functions of
Windows, Mac OS 9.2, and Mac OS X that you can disable before you start
recording, which can help you avoid these irritating interruptions.
Scheduled events and scripts
Windows allows you to set up scheduled events that run automatically at a
certain time or periodically during the day. Although this feature can be a
great convenience, I recommend that you disable any scripted or scheduled
tasks if you’re set to record.

you have finished recording, you can display the Task Scheduler again and
restart the schedule: Choose Advanced➪Continue Task Scheduler, and click
the Close button in the upper-right corner to banish the Scheduler from your
screen.
Although the Mac operating systems don’t have a built-in task scheduler,
you should disable any scheduling software you may have added before you
record; check the program’s documentation to determine how to disable or
pause automatic events.
Network access
Planning on using your recorder on your office or home network? All that net-
work hard drive space makes this idea appealing, but I don’t recommend
recording a CD or DVD from a network source unless you have no other
choice. Depending on the traffic your network carries, your file transfer rate
may slow to a crawl, and your recording may be interrupted by network mes-
sages from your administrator and other users. Someone halfway across the
building may decide to copy that unabridged electronic text of Beowulf that
you have stored on your hard drive.
Worst of all, you may hit a number of hidden snags: restricted or password-
protected file access, network drives that suddenly disappear because they
were brought down, and so forth. When the network suddenly displays a
“dropped connection” dialog box in the middle of your recording session,
you have (to put it delicately) hosed a disc.
I can anchor this warning with a Mark’s Maxim:

Chapter 6: Fine-Tuning Can Be Fun

Rebooting and recording directly from your local computer’s hard
drive is the best idea; don’t log in to your network unless you’re sure
of its stability.™
However, if you absolutely have to use network storage for your recording
(for example, if you have a diskless workstation at your desk), I have three
suggestions:
 Buy a burnproof recorder. Burnproof technology prevents a ruined
recording caused by a sluggish network and usually avoids optical
tragedy even if the recording program is interrupted with a network
message. (Naturally, though, it can’t fix a disconnected network drive!)
 Record by using packet writing. I recommend Roxio Drag-to-Disc for
packet writing, and I cover it in Chapter 10; even older recorders that
don’t offer burnproof protection can successfully burn a disc on a busy
network when you use Drag-to-Disc.
 Record early in the morning or late at night. An empty office generally
means an empty network, with far fewer delays and intrusions from
other network users.
Power-saving mode and screen savers
Computers are now sophisticated pieces of equipment — they can even fall
asleep or switch to standby mode if their lazy humans take a soda or coffee
break. Allowing your computer to switch to these power-saving modes is nor-
mally a great idea: You save electricity without having to shut down your
machine completely. When you’re burning a disc, though, your computer may
not recognize the activity — after all, you’re not really moving your mouse —
and a switch to a power-saving mode can be disastrous! I recommend that you
either disable your computer’s power-saving or standby mode (especially if
you’re recording on a laptop computer) or set it to at least 30 minutes (for
CDs) or 60 minutes (for DVDs) before it kicks in.
The same is true of those cool screen savers that keep boredom at bay. They’re
neat, and I have more than 50 on my own machine, but whenever I use a screen
saver, I set it for at least a 60-minute period of inactivity before it starts. This
period allows me to complete any recording session before the light show
starts and the fun begins.
In Windows XP, you can configure both your power-saving mode and your
screen saver activity delay from the Control Panel. First, click the Power
Options Control Panel icon to display the settings shown in Figure 6-10, and
set both Turn Off Hard Disks and System Standby to Never. To change the
inactivity delay for your screen saver, open the Display Control Panel and
click the Screen Saver tab. Click in the Wait text box and type 30 or 60 for the
number of minutes.

Part II: It’s All in the Preparation 

If you find yourself continually using the Power Options Control Panel, set up
two power schemes you can use to switch back and forth between power-
saving and recording modes.
For Macintosh owners who use Mac OS 9.2, click on the Apple menu and
choose Control Panels. Then, click Energy Saver to display the dialog box
shown in Figure 6-11. Move all the sliders to Never and click the Close button
in the upper-left corner.
If you’re using Mac OS X, click on the Apple menu and choose System

Never and disable the Put the Hard Disk(s) to Sleep When Possible check
box. Click the Close button in the upper-left corner.

Remember, these energy-saving features in Windows and Mac OS are quite
beneficial — just not when you’re recording. Don’t forget to restore your
energy-saving settings when you’re done burning!
Terrific Tips and Tweaks
Although I get into specific recording tips throughout the rest of this book, I
beseech you to pay heed to these general tricks that apply to all types of
recordings.
Avoid disk-intensive, memory-
hungry behemoths
Follow this advice while you’re recording, anyway. In other words, if you don’t
have a burnproof drive, launching programs like Microsoft Outlook, Adobe
Photoshop, or Macromedia Flash during that burn is not A Good Idea. They
simply take up too much system memory and thrash your hard drive too
actively to cooperate well with optical storage.

Give your recording software 
some elbowroom
Is Mac OS 9.2 your recording environment of choice? Do you have at least
64MB of system RAM? Then I strongly recommend that you reserve addi-
tional application memory for your recording software, which can use the
memory for all sorts of good things.
If you’re using Mac OS 9.2, follow these steps to increase the memory allocated
to your recording program:
1. From the Finder, click the recording program’s icon once to highlight
it. Click the File menu family and choose the Get Info item.
2. Click File and select Get Info from the menu.
3. Click Show and choose Memory to display the dialog box shown in
Figure 6-13.
4. In the Preferred Size text box, enter a larger amount of RAM.
As a rule, I tend to double the figure, but you should add at least 1024K,
or 1 megabyte, of extra memory.
5. Click the Close button to close the dialog box and save your changes.

Speed up your hard drive
Here’s a great tweak for PC owners running Windows 98 and Windows Me
that can help your hard drive’s performance! Follow these steps:
1. Right-click the My Computer icon on your desktop and choose
Properties from the pop-up menu.
2. Click the Performance tab and click File System to display the File
System Properties dialog box (see Figure 6-14).
3. Select Network Server from the Typical Role of This Computer drop-
down list box. Drag the Read-Ahead Optimization slider to Full (if it’s
not there already).
4. To save your changes, click OK to exit the File System Properties
dialog box and click OK again to return to the desktop.
Note that you may have to reboot after this step.
Beware the flagged-out laptop
Laptop owners can be proud of their computers, but a loss of battery power
has caused the premature demise of many a recording session. If you’re using a
laptop to burn a CD or DVD while you’re on the road, use your AC adapter if at
all possible — and if not, make doggone sure that your battery is fully charged
and can last for at least 30 minutes. Also, remember that most laptops automat-
ically switch to standby mode if their battery power levels drop below a cer-
tain point, so don’t cut things too closely!

 Selecting the proper format

 Organizing your material properly

 Converting files between formats
A
t this point, you may be ready to throw caution to the wind and start
burning 1s and 0s (zeros) — and I can’t say that I blame you because I
cover a huge amount of ground in this book, and you may not have even
recorded a single disc yet! However, I want to devote just one more chapter to
preparations: in this case, steps you should take to make your finished discs
 Faster during loading and reading
 Better organized
 Easier to use
 Easier to search
See? This stuff is worth another chapter’s wait. I promise! I especially recom-
mend that you take care to follow the guidelines in this chapter when you’re
creating a disc for distribution or creating an archive disc that you will use
often over the next decade or two.
Picking a Jazzy Format
I mention formats as features in Chapter 2. The formats a recorder can burn
are criteria you could use to tell just how high a particular recorder ranks on
the evolutionary scale. In this section, I show you how you can make use of
those different formats. Remember: Certain formats are the right choice for
certain jobs.

Data, lovely data
Data — pure binary 1s and 0s (zeros). Your computer lives on the stuff, and
that’s what data CDs and DVDs are for. If you’re storing only data or program
files — no digital audio — this is the disc format for you. These discs fall into
one of two standards: the Yellow Book (for data CD-ROMs manufactured in 
a factory) and the Orange Book (for data CD-ROMs burned with your CD
recorder). Some specialized types of discs I briefly mention in Chapter 5 of
this book — for example, DVD movies, Video CDs, and photo slideshow
CD-ROMs — are specialized types of data discs.
Use a data CD or DVD when you want to
 Store computer files and programs in the same folder or directory hier-
archy as on your hard drive.
 Take advantage of the maximum storage space for data.
 Run programs directly from the disc.
 Load data (like a Word document or a spreadsheet) directly from the disc.
 Save multimedia files, like digital video and digital photographs, as
pure data.
In case you’re wondering, your computer’s CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive is the
best playback solution for any kind of disc because it can read both audio CDs
and data CD-ROMs (or DVD-ROMs) without blinking. Your audio CD player
can’t return the favor, though. Don’t try to read a standard data CD-ROM in an
audio CD player: If you hear anything, it’s likely to be a screeching wail that
will drive away every living thing within a square mile. I’m not kidding; even
plants try to escape.
Sweet audio for the ears
Unlike a data disc, a disc recorded in audio CD format — also called Red Book —
can store only one type of material (in this case, digital audio). However, it does
this really, really well; so well, in fact, that an audio CD player doesn’t recognize
anything unless it’s either Red Book or a subset of Red Book (like a CD Extra
disc, which I discuss in Chapter 11).
You can use a number of different sources for audio tracks, including
 MP3 files
 WAV files (a Microsoft Windows standard)
 AIFF or AAC files (Macintosh standards)
 WMA files (another Windows standard)
116
Part II: It’s All in the Preparation 

Unlike with a tape cassette, however, you can’t record your voice directly
onto an audio CD. Instead, you have to record your material (usually as an
MP3 or WAV file), and then record that disc in audio CD format later.
Are you a musician who uses a Musical Instrument Digital Interface (or MIDI
for short) instrument or composes in MIDI format? You can record your com-
positions on an audio CD as well, but you still have to create an MP3 or a WAV
digital audio file on your hard drive with your MIDI software. After the music
is in one of these digital formats, you can burn it to an audio CD just like any
other MP3 or WAV audio. (Of course, the latest MIDI composition programs
can do all this behind the scenes, allowing you to record your masterpiece to
an audio CD from a menu command.)
Remember that older standard audio CD players can’t read a CD-RW. Use only
CD-R media when you’re recording CDs unless you’re sure that the finished
discs will be played only on an audio CD player that supports CD-RW media!
117
Chapter 7: Getting Ready for the Ball
Man, this band is horrible!
Okay, let me get this straight: You have just
recorded your first audio CD from that huge
selection of Slim Whitman MP3 files you’re so
proud of, and the burn seemed to go like butter.
You got no error messages, the songs sounded
perfect when you previewed them, and your new
drive churned the disc out in less than three min-
utes. Excellent! Hold on, though — when you try
playing your new disc in your car audio CD player,
you get either a screeching wail that sounds like
a catfight under an outhouse, or nothing. I mean,
absolutely zip. What went wrong?
This is the classic of all classic problems: You
mistakenly recorded a data disc format rather
than the audio CD (Red Book) format! Those
files are still in MP3 format, and they can be
played by using Winamp or another MP3 player
program — but only on your computer. To play
those songs with your audio CD player, you have
to record them again. This time, make sure that
you choose Red Book or digital audio or audio
CD format (whatever your recording software
calls it) when you set up the recording.
Alternatively, you may have recorded an MP3
music disc, which is very similar in format to the
data disc I just described. However, these discs
are now supported by many personal CD play-
ers, home stereo systems, and car audio sys-
tems. The advantage to an MP3 music disc is
the storage space you get: Because the songs
are recorded in their existing MP3 form, they
take up a lot less space than the same songs
recorded in Red Book (digital audio) format.
Unfortunately, if the audio CD player you’re
using doesn’t support MP3 music discs, the
effect is usually the same as trying to play a reg-
ular computer data disc.
Oh, one other possibility exists: If your audio CD
player doesn’t recognize your new CD but your
computer’s CD-ROM drive (or your recorder)
does play it, you have rebelled against tradition
and used a CD-RW rather than a CD-R. Of
course, this particular rebellion is in vain if you’re
using an older audio CD player because a player
that’s four years old or older probably can’t read
a CD-RW. However, that same disc should play
fine in an audio CD player that does support CD-
RW media. (And come to think of it, you haven’t
really wasted a disc because you can reformat
that CD-RW and use it again. Whew!)

Time for a Mark’s Maxim that can save you time and trouble:
Use an old-fashioned CD-R whenever you want to record a disc for a
standard audio CD player!™
Straddle the line with mixed mode
There’s always an exception, right? (Just like those spelling rules you used to
memorize.) In this case, you do have a way to record both data and digital
Red Book audio on the same recordable CD: I’m talking about mixed-mode
format, which is used for multimedia discs and games that need programs,
digital video, and high-quality audio on the same compact disc. As you can
see in Figure 7-1, mixed-mode discs have two tracks: The first contains data,
and the successive tracks are digital audio. Pretty sassy, don’t you think?
Because that first track is a data track, however, you still can’t play a mixed-
mode disc in your audio CD player. This is the opposite of another type of dual-
purpose wonder, the CD Extra disc, where the audio tracks come first, followed
by data tracks. You can play a CD Extra disc in your audio CD player — I venture
into this territory in Chapter 11.

118
Part II: It’s All in the Preparation 

Why aren’t all discs recorded in mixed-mode format? Of course, there’s not
much point in it if you’re recording only files and programs or recording only
digital audio. Other caveats apply:
 Less operating system-friendly: Older versions of DOS, Windows, the
Mac operating system, and UNIX can’t read mixed-mode discs. (Then
again, DOS is fading into an indistinct memory for most of us; I use a
command line only for Linux these days.)
 Less compatible: Older, read-only CD-ROM drives may be able to read
only the first or last track on a mixed-mode disc.
 Decreased capacity: Working the magic of mixed mode takes anywhere
from 3MB to 19MB of wasted space. Most of that space is required in
order to separate the data track from the first audio track. Therefore,
don’t use mixed-mode format if you need to squeeze every possible pit
from your recorded CD.
Use a mixed-mode CD-ROM when you want to
 Store both computer files and digital audio on the same disc.
 Run programs and load files directly from the data track.
Throw caution utterly to the 
wind with packet writing
I crow enough about packet writing — or, as it’s more properly called, Universal
Disc Format (UDF) — in this book that you may already know that it’s one of my
favorite topics. Packet writing makes it easy to record what you want, when
you want it, using any recordable CD or DVD (rewriteable or not). Heck, you
don’t even need to open Easy CD & DVD Creator first to write a UDF disc with
Drag-to-Disc. Just drag and drop as you always do, or save directly to the disc
from within your applications. If you can do it with a floppy disk or a hard
drive, you can do it with packet writing.
Packet writing even allows you to delete files you have written — in a fashion,
anyway. The directory entries for the files you’re deleting are overwritten,
after which the unwanted files effectively vanish. This situation can make it
appear that you’ve erased them completely and regained that space, like you
would with your hard drive, but that’s not the case: They still take up space
on the disc; you simply can’t reach them. (Of course, if you’re using a rewrite-
able disc — that’s CD-RW, DVD+RW, DVD-RW, or DVD-RAM — you can always
erase the entire disc and start over.)
Also, you should remember that all recordable media must be formatted
before you can use it with a UDF program, like Drag-to-Disc. Naturally, after
you’ve filled up a CD-R, you can’t reformat it and use it over again, but (as I
119
Chapter 7: Getting Ready for the Ball

mention earlier) you can reformat a rewriteable CD or DVD recorded with
packet writing. You lose all the data on the disc, of course, but that makes
packet writing a great choice for one-shot discs.
Drawbacks to packet writing? Only a couple exist: You can’t record a Red Book
audio CD by using packet writing, and older operating systems (before Windows
98 and Mac OS 8) can’t read UDF discs without a separate loader program.
“Disc-at-Once? Track-at-Once? 
Why Not All-at-Once?”
If you really want to act like a computer technotype at your next party, walk
over to a group of your friends and jovially inquire, “So, folks, which record-
ing mode do you use with your audio CDs?” It always gets me a laugh. (I don’t
get invited to many parties.)
Anyway, this question is indeed a valid one. The recording mode you use helps
determine the compatibility of your finished disc and how much data or audio
it can contain. Therefore, I cover the three common recording modes now so
that you’re ready to answer my question if we attend the same gala bash.
Meet you at the track
In Track-at-Once recording mode (or, as it’s technically known, CD-ROM Mode 1),
each data or audio track is kept primly separate from the others: No co-ed
mingling here! As you can see in Figure 7-2, your recorder turns off the laser
write head between tracks.
On the positive side, Track-at-Once mode is supported on every recorder, no
matter how old, and can be read on any CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive. That’s
why it’s the default recording mode used by most recording programs.
Unfortunately, those gaps left by the laser when it toggles off can cause a
distinctive click noise between each track on an audio CD — whether you
hear it depends on the audio CD player, but it can be excruciatingly irritating.
Therefore, Track-at-Once is best used for data CD-ROMs.
Do it all at once
Disc-at-Once recording mode is the best pick for audio CDs. That’s because
your recorder’s laser is never turned off, and the entire disc is written at once
(as illustrated in Figure 7-3). You don’t hear a click between tracks, no matter
what type of audio CD player you use.

121
Chapter 7: Getting Ready for the Ball

Disc-at-Once mode has three drawbacks: First, truly antique CD recorders
(ones that are older than 5 years or so) can’t write in Disc-at-Once mode, so if
you own an older drive and you try to select Disc-at-Once in your recording
software, you will probably find that you can’t select it. Second, your disc
takes longer to record in Disc-at-Once mode. Finally, Disc-at-Once recording
may occupy more temporary hard drive space because — depending on your
recording software — your computer may have to create an image file of the
entire disc before it can begin burning.
Multipurpose multisession
Multisession recording (or to be technically correct, CD-ROM/XA Mode 2)
allows you to add more than one separate session to a disc (think of a chap-
ter in a book), each of which can be read just like a different CD, as shown in
Figure 7-4. You can record sessions at different times, too, which makes multi-
session recording particularly handy for incremental recordings over weeks
or months.

Part II: It’s All in the Preparation 

Again, compatibility is an issue: Multisession mode is not supported on many
older, read-only CD-ROM drives, and you need a separate program that can
switch between sessions to read all the material on the disc. Also, multisession
discs can’t be properly read in audio CD players.
Long Filenames Are Your Friends
While I’m discussing the decisions you must make before recording a data
CD-ROM or DVD-ROM, I think that now is the right time to mention the five
major file systems. A file system is a specific set of naming conventions and a
data layout that . . . Whoops, there I go again, letting loose the programmer
technical troll within me. (Sorry about that.)
To keep this simple, a file system determines
 What type of computer can read your disc
 The allowable filenames and their length
 The total number of subdirectories (or folders) that can appear on the
disc and what arrangement they can take
The five major file systems are
 Microsoft Joliet: Supported since Windows 95, Joliet is now by far the
most common file system used on PC CD-ROMs. Joliet provides the long
filenames and folder names that the Windows crowd now finds indis-
pensable, and those names can include niceties like periods, spaces, and
most of the characters on your keyboard. A notable exception is the \
(backslash) key, so don’t try to use it. If you’re burning a disc on a PC for
a PC running Windows, you have little reason to use anything else.
 UDF: Universal Disc Format is a fancier name for packet writing, but it’s
also a file system. UDF is usually the file system of choice for burning
data DVDs and DVD-Video discs, since it can handle individual files over
1GB with aplomb.
 HFS: If you own a Macintosh, most of your Mac-only discs use the
Hierarchical File System (HFS). Some programs allow a Windows system
to recognize and read HFS discs (and, in the same vein, you can find Mac
extensions that allow Mac OS 8 and earlier to read Joliet discs). Both
Mac OS 9.2 and Mac OS X can read Joliet discs without any help, thank
you very much.
 Hybrid: Hybrid discs contain both a Joliet session and an HFS session
and can be read on both PCs and Macs.
 ISO 9660: Finally, I come to the oldest file system still in use. ISO 9660
has been around since the dawn of the CD-ROM, and virtually every
123
Chapter 7: Getting Ready for the Ball

operating system ever shipped can read it (including heretics like UNIX,
Linux, Solaris, and OS/2 Warp). Unfortunately, this high level of compati-
bility is caused by a strict file and folder naming convention, so you don’t
find long filenames on an ISO 9660 disc. (You’re back to the DOS standard
of eight-character filenames and three-character extensions.) Also, you
can store a far fewer number of files in each directory.
Which one should you use? Luckily, this question is one that basically decides
itself. For a PC disc, I strongly recommend Joliet; Mac owners can rely on HFS.
Folks recording cross-platform PC or Mac discs should use the Hybrid file
system. Hollywood types recording DVD-Video discs should choose UDF.
Finally, if you’re looking for the widest possible distribution among the largest
number of different computers and operating systems, go with the perennial
favorite, ISO 9660.
The Right Way to Organize Files
Yes, Virginia, there is indeed a right way to add files to a data, mixed-mode,
multisession, or UDF CD-ROM! Smart organization makes finding that certain
data file for your tax return easier — which is especially useful if you’re being
audited tomorrow. No matter what sort of data you’re recording, I urge you to
heed this oft-repeated Mark’s Maxim:
Take the time to think things through!™
Believe me. I have spent many years — numbering in the decades now —
organizing my data. As an author and consultant, I can’t afford to waste time
digging through an entire binder of 250 discs, trying to figure out what was
burned where. Therefore, heed my words when I say:
 Use every character of those long filenames! The ability to use long
filenames is the primary reason why you should use the Joliet file
system whenever possible. You may know now that the file named
AHARCAKE you just burned is Aunt Harriet’s fruitcake recipe, but will
you remember that after 5 or 10 years?
 Put your files in folders! This problem is a common one with hard
drives, too. Storing all your files in the root directory (like the C drive)
results in the worst kind of anarchy (the computer kind!). Also, file sys-
tems such as ISO 9660 can handle only a certain number of files in any
directory or folder, including the root directory. The solution is simple:
Create new folders in the root directory of your CD layout and give the
new arrivals logical names, and then organize the files within the folders
(more on this in a second).
124
Part II: It’s All in the Preparation 

 Use a logical file arrangement. You can help yourself in years to come
when you’re searching for files by organizing them in a Spock-ian fashion:
That is, stick files of the same type or files that relate to the same topic
together in one folder. Or, if you have enough files and you have the time,
you can do both with folder names like Pictures of Fluffy in 2002. Think of
the fun you can have! (Okay, I need another Diet Coke.) Anyway, when
you combine a folder arrangement like this with long filenames, you can
suddenly locate that needle in a haystack — and you can still find it three
years from now.
 Use file-cataloging software. Some shareware and commercial disc cata-
loging programs can store the names and locations of every file on a drive.
These programs create indexed databases of each CD-ROM you record.
With one of these utilities, searching for a single file among 20 of your per-
sonal library discs is as simple as using the Windows Search feature. Your
operating system may also allow you to search an entire disc. For example,
Mac OS 9.2 features Sherlock, and Mac OS X includes the powerful Find
feature, as shown in see Figure 7-5. You can use both to search not only for
filenames but also strings of text inside documents!
Of course, you may not want to spend this kind of time if your disc holds two
or three 200MB video clips and nothing else — but it sure helps when you
have 300 files to store on one CD-ROM.

“Thumbnails? You’re Kidding, Right?”
Not the human body kind of thumbnails! I mean the postage stamp-size pic-
tures that represent larger JPEG, TIFF, and bitmap images stored inside a
folder. (You may have seen thumbnails in Windows XP, which can be set to
show image thumbnails within Windows Explorer.) When you use a program
like Paint Shop Pro (www.jasc.com) that can generate these munchkins, you
can build a catalog of thumbnails that make it easy to scan dozens of images
in seconds (using the most sophisticated optical hardware ever designed, the
Human Eye. . . patent pending, I’m sure). After you have found the right image,
just double-click the thumbnail to load it. Figure 7-6 shows a screen chock-full
of thumbnails that I’m searching through with Paint Shop Pro.
If you also want to catalog your other multimedia files — like sound files and
video clips — you can use Jasc Media Center Plus at www.jasc.com. Like dig-
ital images, the multimedia thumbnails in this program allow you to preview
your stuff by just clicking the icons.
No matter what program you use, the trick to remember is that you must
generate the program’s catalog and add it to the disc layout so that it can be
recorded along with the rest of the material. (No sense in keeping the catalog
file on your hard drive for 100 years, unless, of course, you use this disc
every day.)

Part II: It’s All in the Preparation 

Converting Files for Fun and Profit
Before I end this chapter, here’s a riddle for you: If you have burned a CD-ROM
or DVD-ROM of photographs from your digital camera in JPEG format (which
most cameras produce) and you’re using a Macintosh, what have you done
wrong? (Because this chapter is about convenience and ease of use, consider
that a clue.)
Technically, the answer is “nothing” — until you try to use those images in
many Macintosh applications. You see, some Mac programs that use graphics
favor images in TIFF format. Of course, you can use an image editor like
Photoshop to open those JPEG images and convert them to TIFF format each
time you use them, but talk about a time-wasting hassle! In this case, you would
have made a wise decision if you converted all those files to TIFF format before
you recorded them so that you can simply pop the disc into your computer and
load photos directly from it. (Don’t worry if you didn’t get that one — it was
extra credit.)
With this example in mind, I want to devote this last section to format con-
versions: which common formats work best in what situations and which
programs work best when converting files to other formats. The idea is
twofold: You want your material in the form you use it most, and you also
want that material to be recognizable and usable in years to come.
What exactly is a format? A computer programmer would tell you that a file
format is an arrangement of data that corresponds to specific byte positions
and data element lengths. (Whew. Thank goodness my days of writing COBOL
are over.) We flesh-and-blood humans can simply think of a format as a lan-
guage that’s recognized by a program for storing and reading files. For exam-
ple, although an image may look exactly the same when it’s displayed in two
different formats, one file may be 100K, and another may be 1MB! The differ-
ence in size is caused by the format, which determines the way the image
data is saved.
You’re likely to encounter four major species of formats when you’re record-
ing CDs:
 Audio: Without a doubt, the two most popular — and usable — audio
formats for saving your recordings are MP3 and Windows WAV. Between
the two, MP3 is probably the best choice because WAV files can reach
colossal sizes when recording longer songs at higher-quality sampling
rates. Also, Macintosh owners have far more support on their systems
for MP3 than for WAV. To convert other sound formats to MP3, I use
Musicmatch Jukebox Plus (www.musicmatch.com), as illustrated in
Figure 7-7. You can download the basic version for free.
127
Chapter 7: Getting Ready for the Ball

 Video: Digital video now generally resides in QuickTime MOV format,
Microsoft AVI format, or MPEG format — and surprisingly enough, I’m
again not recommending the Microsoft standard. Instead, I archive my
video clips in MPEG format, which is recognized by just about every
editor on the planet. You can be certain that future versions of your
editor will be able to import your clips for new projects. For conversion,
I use Adobe Premiere on the PC, which can import all these formats.
More expensive commercial programs can handle a wider range of less
popular formats, but because I use only the Big Three, Premiere works
fine in my case.
 Images: For archival purposes, select JPEG, TIFF, or Windows Bitmap;
the latter two don’t use compression that degrades the image, so they
offer better quality, but both TIFF and bitmap images are much larger
than their JPEG counterparts. JPEG is recognized by most image editors
(and because JPEG is the format of choice for Web pages, you have the
advantage of being able to copy your archived images directly to your
Web site). On the PC side, either Paint Shop Pro (from Jasc) or Adobe
Photoshop does the conversion trick. On the Macintosh side, use
Photoshop or the classic GraphicConverter from Lemke Software, at
www.lemkesoft.de/en/index.htm (see Figure 7-8).

Part II: It’s All in the Preparation 
Don’t forget that virus check!
As a final preparation before burning, I always
run Norton AntiVirus (see the Downloads page
at www.symantec.com) and check the con-
tents of those folders that contain the files I
have selected — especially for a disc I’m giving
to someone else. Can you think of anything
more antisocial than sending your friend a virus
in a Word document or a program file?

 Documents: I can’t think of a better set of tools for importing, convert-
ing, and exporting all sorts of document formats than Microsoft Office
(www.microsoft.com). On both the PC and Macintosh, it can read most
of your ancient, hoary document formats for spreadsheets, word pro-
cessing files, presentations, and databases. For archival purposes, it’s a
safe bet that saving your documents in one of the standard Microsoft
formats from the Office suite of applications is a good idea.

t’s time to crank up Easy CD & DVD Creator on your PC and find out how
to make basic data discs and audio CDs! You can consider this chapter the
bread and butter of optical recording: These types of discs are likely to make
up 90 percent of the recordings burned by most PCs. First, I describe the basic
steps for each procedure, and I close this chapter with two projects that illus-
trate specific tasks.
Interested in recording data and audio discs on a Macintosh? I fill in the details
on recording with Toast in Chapter 9.
Recording Data: Putting Files on a Disc
The first disc I ever recorded was a data CD-ROM — ah, the memories! In fact,
the first version of Easy CD & DVD Creator hadn’t been released yet, and the
primitive software I used was anything but automatic or easy to use. In fact, I
burned a couple of useless coasters before I finally got everything to work.

Just about everything has changed for the better. Easy CD & DVD Creator
shields you from as much of the drudge work of burning a disc as possible.
Follow these steps to record a basic data disc with folders and files from your
PC’s hard drive:
1. Load a blank disc into your recorder.
If you’re using a CD-RW, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, or DVD-RAM, it should be
formatted (see the section “Erasing a Rewriteable Disc,” later in this
chapter). Easy CD & DVD Creator detects that you have loaded a blank
disc and automatically displays the rather sexy-looking Home window
(as shown in Figure 8-1).
To run the Home window from the Start menu, choose Start➪All
Programs➪Roxio Easy CD and DVD Creator 6➪Home.
2. Click the funky button marked Creator Classic.
The Home program then runs Creator Classic, which is the main record-
ing application within Easy CD & DVD Creator 6.
3. Choose File➪New Project➪Data Disc. 
Easy CD & DVD Creator opens an empty data disc layout, like the one
shown in Figure 8-2.
If you would rather run Creator Classic directly from the Start menu,
choose Start➪All Programs➪Roxio Easy CD and DVD Creator 6➪
Creator Classic.

135
Chapter 8: Taking Easy CD & DVD Creator for a Spin
See the folder tree that fills the top portion of the window? It operates
just like Windows Explorer, and you use it to select the folders and files
to include in your layout.
4. To open a folder and display the contents, double-click it; to move up
to the preceding directory, click the Up One Level button (which looks
like a folder with an up arrow on it).
You can also use the Select source drop-down list box to navigate to a
specific drive or top-level folder on your system. Highlight a folder or file
that you want to add by clicking once on the name — you can highlight
several by holding down the Ctrl key while you click.
5. After you have highlighted the folders and files that you want to add
in the current directory, click the Add to Project button in the center
of the screen.
Alternatively, you can click and hold the mouse to drag the selected icons
from the Explorer tree to the project layout display that fills the bottom
half of the window. Oh, and if you look at the bottom of the window, you
see a truly nifty bar display that tells you how many megabytes you have
used in your layout and how much space remains — programs like this
one make me proud to be a technonerd. To switch between different CD
and DVD capacities, click the Select Disc Size button, which is conve-
niently placed to the left of the bar display.
Figure 8-2:
An empty
data disc
layout, just
waiting
for your
selections.

6. If necessary, repeat Steps 4 and 5 with other folders until all the
files that you want added appear in the layout display (as shown in
Figure 8-3).
You can drag and drop in the project layout display, too, so it’s easy to
arrange files in different folders or in the root directory of the disc if
necessary.
Arrgh! It never fails: You’re almost finished designing your project layout,
and your mom calls (either on the phone, or from the kitchen). Luckily,
you can save your current project within Easy CD & DVD Creator. Choose
File➪Save Project List, enter a filename in the File Name field, and click
Save. (To copy the current project under another name, choose File➪
Save Project List As instead.) When you’re ready to continue with your
project, run Easy CD & DVD Creator, choose File➪Open CD Project; high-
light the project file and click Open to load it.
You probably won’t be satisfied with a name like 010803_0203 for your
disc — I don’t blame you! Therefore, why not change it? Click once on
the disc name, and then change the name just like you would rename a
file on the Windows desktop. Remember that you are limited to a certain
number of letters, depending on the file system you’re using, so keep your
name short.
136
Part III: Hang On — Here We Go! 
The great file and folder hunt
“I know I put that file somewhere on this
drive!” Brothers and sisters, I feel your pain —
searching for one document in the midst of
50 directories and 30,000 files is not my idea of
a fun way to spend an afternoon. If you agree,
click the Find Files or Folders button (the button
with the folder and the magnifying glass) next to
the Select Source Files list box to call for help
from Easy CD & DVD Creator.
First, choose the drive that you want to search
by clicking the Look In drop-down list box. (Boy,
those Windows programmers in Redmond sure
know how to label their fields.) Then, select your
search criteria:
The filename: Even if you know only a part of the
filename, you can enter it in the Named field.
(Don’t forget to enable the Include Subfolders
check box if you want to search the folders
below the specified location.)
A word or phrase in a file: Search for all files
containing a certain string of text by entering
the text in the Containing Text field.
The file’s time and date stamp: Click the When
Was It Modified tab. You can specify a search
for files created or modified within the last
week, month or year. Alternatively, click Specify
Dates and type the beginning and ending dates
in the From and To fields.
The size of the file: Click the What size is it tab
and choose its minimum or maximum size. You
can select one of the predefined sizes (less than
100K, less than 1MB or more than 1MB), or click
Specify size in K and type the target file size
yourself.
When you’re ready to go, click Search. Good
luck, Mighty Hunter!

Chapter 8: Taking Easy CD & DVD Creator for a Spin
7. Everything squared and ready? Houston, you’re go for recording!
Click the Big Orange Disc-on-Fire Button in the lower-right corner of
the window.
The program presents the Record Setup dialog box you see in Figure 8-4.
For a simple data disc, the program’s default hardware settings should
work just fine.
8. Check to make sure that the correct drive and recording speed are
listed.
9. If you want to be extra careful, you can click the Details button to 
display the advanced settings, and then enable the Test and Record
radio button. Although it takes twice as long, Easy CD & DVD Creator
performs a test recording first, and if the test is successful, you can
perform the recording.
If a problem occurs, you save a blank disc from becoming a coaster. After
you have become comfortable with your recorder, however, I recommend
that you pick Record and press onward.
10. You can make more than one copy of your disc by specifying the
number in the Number of Copies field.
Figure 8-3:
The Data
Disc project
layout is
rapidly
filling up.

11. If you can enable the Buffer Underrun Prevention check box, do so
with all haste — this action turns on your drive’s support for burn-
proof recording.
12. If you’re recording in Track-at-Once mode, you can choose one of
these options:
• Don’t Finalize Session: Leaves the disc open so that you can record
more data later without creating a multisession disc. However, until
you finalize either the session or the disc, you can read this disc
only in your recorder. If this field is grayed out, either your drive
or the file system that you chose doesn’t support this option.

Part III: Hang On — Here We Go! 
How do you “test” a CD-R?
“Hang on, there, Mark — you said that I could
use a CD-R, DVD-R, or DVD+R only once. How
can my recorder test the disc without messing
it up?”
Easy! If you remember my discussion of lasers
in Chapter 1, you remember that your recorder
can toggle between two power levels; when
you test a layout, your recorder acts like it’s burn-
ing the disc, when in fact the laser is toggled to
the lower power setting. At this lower setting,
the beam doesn’t affect the dye layer (or the
crystalline layer, if you’re using a rewriteable
disc).
The result is a safe test: Easy CD & DVD Creator
can still detect whether it would encounter an
error while recording, but if errors are detected,
you don’t lose your blank disc!

139
Chapter 8: Taking Easy CD & DVD Creator for a Spin
• Finalize Session, Don’t Finalize Disc: Closes the current session
so that the disc can be read in any CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive;
however, the disc itself is not finalized, so you can write additional
sessions and create a multisession disc.
• Finalize Disc: The entire disc is closed, so you can’t write any fur-
ther sessions. (You can consider it write-protecting the disc.) I typ-
ically use this option if I’m recording in Track-at-Once mode.
13. Click OK to start the wheels turning!
If you used the Windows Start menu method of running the Home window
and you haven’t already loaded a blank disc in the recorder, the program
automatically ejects the tray and demands that you feed it one.
The Burn Disc Progress dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 8-5, and
you can watch the fun. After the disc has been recorded, you can option-
ally run Label Creator or just quit and try out your new toy.
Congratulations! You’re the proud creator of a brand-new data disc.
Recording Your Music
Remember to rip and record only what you’ve bought, or what’s legally avail-
able on the Internet. Likewise, don’t copy commercial software and blithely
hand it over to those who didn’t pay a penny for it. I won’t turn into a lawyer
and start talking unintelligible legalese, but honor the copyrights of the musi-
cians and software developers that worked the long hours. Please.
Figure 8-5:
This is it,
Bucko!
You’re

These days, I find myself recording audio CDs primarily from MP3 files —
however, Easy CD & DVD Creator can also
 Copy both individual tracks from existing CDs (in a process sweetly
called ripping).
 Copy an entire existing audio CD. (Find out more on this in the next sec-
tion, where I show you how to clone things with CD Copier.)
With your permission, then, I show you how to create the Ultimate Motorhead
Mix CD (or, if you prefer, the Absolute Best of Alvin and the Chipmunks):
1. Load a blank disc into your recorder, which automatically displays
the Home screen.
Yes, I’m saying it again: Do not use a CD-RW when recording a standard
audio CD for use in a stereo system unless the player is designed to play
CD-RWs! Are you getting tired of that sentence yet? (How about these
italicized sentences?) Anyway, you can’t say that I didn’t warn you.
2. Click the Creator Classic button in the Home window.
3. Choose File➪New Project➪Music CD.
If you’d rather create an MP3 music CD (and your audio CD player sup-
ports MP3 music discs), choose File➪New Project➪MP3 Player Disc
instead. You can then add up to 700MB of MP3 files from your hard drive
because an MP3 music disc is actually a data disc (not a true audio CD).
MP3 music discs store MP3 songs in their native format, so you can get
several hours of listening pleasure on a single CD! (Remember, however,
that you can’t play an MP3 music disc in an audio CD player that doesn’t
support the format . . . you hear absolutely zilch.)
4. Now it’s time to add tracks from the Easy CD & DVD Creator screen
shown in Figure 8-6. You can select one of these options:
• Add MP3, WAV, or WMF files: Use Explorer view in the upper-left
half of the screen to locate folders where your audio files are stored.
• Rip tracks from another CD: Load a disc into either your CD-ROM
or DVD-ROM drive or your recorder and then select that drive from
the Select Source drop-down list box to display the tracks. To load
other tracks from other audio CDs, repeat the process.
If you don’t have a track listing for the disc you have loaded, just double-
click on a track in Explorer view in the upper-right half of the screen.
Easy CD & DVD Creator displays the Preview player, and you can listen
to the track before you add it to your layout.
5. Click once on each track that you want to add.
To choose more than one track from the same source, hold down the
Ctrl key as you select each track name.
140
Part III: Hang On — Here We Go!

Chapter 8: Taking Easy CD & DVD Creator for a Spin
6. After you have selected your tracks from the source folder or disc,
click the Add to Project button (which looks like an arrow pointing
down) in the center of the window to add them to your project layout.
(Alternatively, you can drag the music files from the Explorer view
and drop them on the layout at the bottom of the screen.)
7. Continue repeating Steps 4 through 6 until your track layout is
complete — or until you have packed every second of your blank
disc!
You can tell how much time you have used on your disc by checking the
Estimated Time bar at the bottom of the screen; it tells you how much
time the current track list needs and the remaining time you can fill on
both a 74-minute and 80-minute CD-R.
8. Arrange the tracks in your layout as you like by clicking a track name
to highlight it and dragging it to the new position in the track list.
9. Although it’s not necessary, I recommend that you enter both a name
for your new disc in the New Disc Title field and the artist’s name in
the Artist Name field.
Need to change or add a name for a track? Just click the entry to high-
light it and click again to edit the New Disc Title field.

10. Ready to burn those hip 1s and 0s (zeros)? Click the Big Orange Disc-
on-Fire Button at the right lower corner of the window.
If you’re loading tracks from an audio CD, Easy CD & DVD Creator
prompts you to load the pesky thing when it’s necessary so that the
tracks can be copied and converted.
The program displays the Record Setup dialog box.
11. If necessary, select your recorder and select the fastest possible
recording speed.
12. You can clone multiple copies of your new music disc by clicking the
arrows next to the Number of Copies field.
13. Enable the Buffer Underrun Protection check box if your drive sup-
ports burnproof recording.
14. To add a little technowow touch to your new audio CD, enable the
Write CD-Text check box!
Many audio CD players (and most CD player programs for your computer)
display CD-Text while the disc is playing, which includes the disc name,
artist name, and each track name.
15. If your recorder supports Disc-at-Once mode, select it (to prevent
clicks between tracks). Otherwise, choose Track-at-Once mode and
choose the Finalize Disc option.
16. Click OK, you music-producing mogul! If your recorder is empty, Easy
CD & DVD Creator yells for you to load a blank disc.
The program displays the Burn Disc Progress dialog box (which has
already popped up in Figure 8-5), allowing you to monitor the 1s and 0s
(zeros) as they’re shoveled into the furnace and onto your disc. When
the recording is done, you have the choice of running Label Creator if
you want to print a fancy-looking label or a set of jewel box inserts.
Time to grab your headphones and jam to your latest creation!
Copying a Disc
In this section, I describe how you can copy an existing data disc (both
CD-ROMs and unprotected DVD-ROMs) or an audio CD. Rather than take the
time to crank up Easy CD & DVD Creator, Roxio provides you with a separate
program named Disc Copier; it can clone a disc by using just the recorder. If
you’re lucky enough to have either a read-only CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive or
a second recorder in the same system, you can even copy drive-to-drive and
whip out a copy in record time!
Follow these steps to copy a disc:

Chapter 8: Taking Easy CD & DVD Creator for a Spin
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪Easy CD and DVD Creator 6➪Disc Copier
to display what’s shown in Figure 8-7.
2. Click the Source drop-down list box and select the drive in which you
have loaded the disc that you want to copy.
It can be any drive on your system that can read a disc, including your
recorder.
3. Click the Destination drop-down list box and select the recorder that
will burn the disc.
Remember that it can be the same as the Source drive.
4. Checking the advanced settings (see Figure 8-8) before you begin the
copy is a good idea, so click the Options button.
5. You can select the Test, Test then Copy, or Copy option. Because I’m
familiar with my equipment, I skip any testing and jump right to the
real thing. However, Test then Copy does the trick as well (it just takes
twice as long), and you won’t lose a blank disc if something is SNAFU.
6. If you want more than one copy of the original disc, click the arrows
next to the Number of Copies field and select, well, the number of
copies!
7. Using the Buffer Underrun Prevention feature (or burnproof, as we
know it) whenever possible is a good idea, so enable the Buffer
Underrun Prevention check box if your drive supports it.
8. Click the Big Orange Disc-on-Fire Button at the lower-right corner of
the window to unleash the fearsome power of your laser, and be pre-
pared to load a blank disc if you’re using one drive to copy.
Figure 8-7:

Using a Disc Image
From time to time, you may find that you need multiple copies of a disc, but
you don’t want to produce them all at one time. Perhaps the data will change
within a few weeks or you’re preparing discs for sale or distribution, but you
don’t know how many copies you need.
This situation is where a disc image comes in handy. Think of it as a complete
CD or DVD saved as a single file to your hard drive. In fact, you can even create
a disc image for later burning without a recorder! I know that sounds screwy,
but when you’re on the road with your laptop or you’re at the office and you
don’t have your external recorder with you, you can create a disc image file
instead. After your computer and external recorder are reunited, recording
that disc is a snap.
However, you have to look at the downside: The disc image takes up all the
space of its optical sibling, so each disc image you save on your hard drive
takes up the space the data occupies on the recorded disc. Therefore, saving
anywhere from 800MB to 5GB of free space on your drive (depending on the
type of disc you’re burning) is a good idea if you think that you need to create
a disc image.

Using Multisession Discs
As I mention in Chapter 2 of this book, multisession discs have fallen out of
favor with the arrival of the UDF format (also called packet writing). Both
allow you to record a disc, use it, and then record additional information on
it. With a UDF disc, however, you get the same versatility without the extra
twists and turns of multisession recording. For example, you don’t have to
run Easy CD & DVD Creator to record another session, and you don’t need a
separate session-selection program (which allows you to choose which
volume you’re going to read).
However, I’m a thorough guy, and you may someday have to make a multi-
session disc for some specific application — therefore, allow me to cover
multisession recording in this section.
Keep in mind that not all drives on the planet can read multisession discs!
Use them only when a standard single-session CD-ROM doesn’t do the trick.
Two different types of multisession discs exist, and Creator Classic can burn
them both:
 Incremental: Use an incremental multisession disc when you know 
that you want to add data to an existing session later. As you can see in
Figure 8-11, successive sessions can add material or “delete” existing
material by overwriting it. (Sorry, Charlie, it doesn’t mean that you get
that space back — your drive simply can’t read it any longer.) Because
the data in the preceding session is imported into the new one, you
don’t need a session-selection program. Your drive simply reads the
latest session that you burned.
 Multivolume: In a multivolume multisession disc (See Figure 8-12), all
the sessions are kept chaste and separate, and they can’t be updated
like the data on an incremental disc. You need a session-selection pro-
gram to switch from one volume to another (and you can read from only
one session at a time).

To burn an incremental multisession disc, make sure that you record the first
session on the disc by using the Joliet file system, and select these options
on the Record Setup dialog box:
 The Track-at-Once recording method
 The Finalize Session, Don’t Finalize Disc option (creates a first session,
but doesn’t close the disc permanently)
When you’re ready to record again, follow these steps:
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪Roxio Easy CD and DVD Creator 6➪
Creator Classic to run the program.
2. Load the original disc in your recorder.

5. Finish your recording as usual.
When Creator Classic displays the Record Setup dialog box, remember
to select the Finalize Session, Don’t Finalize Disc option if you want to
update the session again in the future! If you’re all done (and you’re sure
about that), I recommend that you click the Finalize the Disc radio button.
Erasing a Rewriteable Disc
After you have finished with a CD-RW, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, or DVD-RAM, do
you simply chuck it in the nearest wastebasket? No! Instead, you can erase
the entire disc at one time (you have no way to erase only part of the disc —
it’s either all or nothing) and use it all over again.
To erase a rewriteable disc with Easy CD & DVD Creator:
1. Load the offending rewriteable disc into your recorder.
2. Click on the Select source drop-down list box and choose your
recorder.
3. Click the Disc menu and choose Erase Disc, which displays the dialog
box shown in Figure 8-13.
Figure 8-13:
Is that a
quick or
full disc
erasure?
148
Part III: Hang On — Here We Go! 

You can choose a quick erase or a full erase. I agree with the good folks at
Roxio and recommend a quick erase in most cases.
When do you use the Full Erase option? I guess that sometimes you want to
be absolutely sure! However, if you’re trying to record by using a rewriteable
disc and Easy CD & DVD Creator reports errors with the disc’s formatting or
TOC (table of contents) information, you probably have to erase the disc to
make it usable again. This can happen if a recording session is interrupted by
a power failure or if Easy CD & DVD Creator should — perish the thought —
crash on you.
Click Start to begin the process — and take a break for a soda or a cup of java
if you have selected the Full Erase option.
Project: Developing MP3 Fever
Friends, I have a hankerin’ to hear the King — that’s right, Elvis Aron Presley
himself. The trouble is, I have all my Elvis songs in MP3 format on my hard
drive and I want to listen to them in my ’64 Cadillac’s audio CD player! If you’re
in the same boat, you have come to the right project: burning a Best of Elvis
audio CD. (And yes, neighbors, I own the original commercial CDs for the
music that I use in this project! I just ripped the tracks into MP3 format for
this demonstration.)
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪Roxio Easy CD and DVD Creator 6➪
Home.
2. Click the Creator Classic button in the Home window.
3. Choose File➪New Project➪Music CD.
4. Click the Select source drop-down list box and select the drive where
your MP3 files are living. Use Explorer view in the upper-left half of
the screen to navigate to the right folder.
5. Hold down the Ctrl key and, in the right pane of the Explorer view,
click the MP3 files that you want to add.
As you can see in Figure 8-14, I have chosen six songs by Elvis from an
entire folder of MP3 files.
6. Click the Add to Project button in the center of the screen — it looks
like an arrow pointing down. Figure 8-15 shows the tracks as they
appear in the bottom window.

150
Part III: Hang On — Here We Go! 

7. If you want to add songs from another folder, repeat Steps 4 through 6.
Personally, I think that these are the King’s best songs, so let me stop
here. As you can tell by the bar display at the bottom of the screen, these
tracks take up about 13 minutes and 27 seconds, and I have about 66
minutes and 31 seconds of additional space on an 80-minute blank disc.
8. You can click and drag the track names to rearrange them. I want my
disc to start out with “Jailhouse Rock,” so I click and drag the entry
from Slot 5 to Slot 1.
9. Click in the New Disc Title field and enter a name for your disc.
10. Click in the Artist Name field and enter the name of the performer 
or band.
11. As you can see in Figure 8-16, the disc layout is ready to record, so
click the Big Orange Disc-on-Fire Button.
The Record Disc dialog box appears.
12. I need only one copy of this disc, so I leave the Number of Copies field
set to 1.
Figure 8-16:

Chapter 8: Taking Easy CD & DVD Creator for a Spin

13. Even if your audio CD player doesn’t display CD-Text, you may
encounter one in the future. Therefore, I always recommend that
you enable the Write CD-Text check box for an audio CD.
14. My recorder supports Disc-at-Once recording, so I definitely want to
select the Disc-at-Once option. (If this field is grayed out, your recorder
doesn’t offer Disc-at-Once — use Track-at-Once mode with the Finalize
Disc option instead.)
15. Click OK to start the wheels turning and then load a blank disc.
16. When the recording is finished, you can run Label Creator (for help,
turn to Chapter 14). Otherwise, eject your disc and enjoy your Elvis!
Project: Archiving Digital Photographs
Got a number of family photos you have taken with your digital camera? Why
not burn them to a data CD-ROM and free up that hard drive space for other
programs? Here’s how you can burn a basic archive of digital images:
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪Roxio Easy CD and DVD Creator 6➪
Creator Classic.
2. Choose File➪New Project➪Data Disc.
3. Click the Select Source drop-down list box and navigate to the drive
where your images are stored. To move to another folder, use Explorer
view in the upper-left half of the screen.
4. Click one or more filenames while you hold down the Ctrl key.
5. Click the Add to Project button in the center of the screen — that’s
the arrow pointing down — or drag the highlighted files to the bottom
window. As you can see in Figure 8-17, my images now appear in the
data project layout.
6. To select more images, just repeat Steps 4 through 6 until you have
added all the photos that you want (or, of course, until the disc is full).
Use the bar display at the bottom of the screen to keep track of how
much space remains.
7. To create a new folder in your project layout, right-click on the disc
title in the Layout window in the lower-left corner and choose New
Folder from the pop-up menu. The new folder appears with the name
highlighted; type a name for the new folder and press Enter to save it.
To move images in and out of folders, click and drag the filenames
wherever you want them.
In this example, I have created a folder named Our Dogs, and I have
dragged three images into it.
152
Part III: Hang On — Here We Go! 

8. Click the disc title to highlight it and click it again to type a new name —
I used Photos 2004 for this disc.
9. The final disc layout appears in Figure 8-18. Click the Big Orange Disc-
on-Fire Button!
The Record Disc dialog box appears.
10. If you don’t want multiple copies, leave the Number of Copies field
set to 1.
11. Select the Disc-at-Once option if you can; if not, use Track-at-Once mode
with the Finalize Disc option.
12. Click OK to start the wheels turning and then load a blank disc.
13. When the recording is finished, you can run Label Creator (for help,
turn to Chapter 14); otherwise, eject your disc and hand your photo
disc to Grandma!
Because you finalized this disc, you can’t write to it again. If your drive sup-
ports packet writing, Chapter 10 shows how to create a UDF disc that you can
add files to in the future.

A Step-by-Step Guide to . . . Toast?
In This Chapter
 Recording HFS data CD-ROMs
 Recording audio CDs on the Macintosh
 Creating a Hybrid Mac/PC disc
 Burning video on CDs and DVDs
 Creating a Temporary Partition
 Recording DVD-R backups with Toast
I
don’t even own a toaster, but I use my Toast to burn all the time! (Try
explaining that to your friends.) In the Macintosh world, however, that
sentence makes perfect sense. Compared to Easy CD & DVD Creator, Toast 6
Titanium for the Macintosh (from Roxio) is a lean, mean, and exceptionally
attractive recording machine. As you may guess, the program’s menu system
and appearance are radically different from its Windows sibling, and it has a
number of Mac-specific features. (If you’re running Mac OS 9.2, you’re out of
luck. Toast 6 Titanium runs only under Mac OS X — progress marches on.)
In this chapter, you take a look at both the basics of recording and many of
the advanced options available within Toast.
Putting Files on a Disc
Toast can create two different types of Hierarchical File System (HFS) discs:
 Mac OS Standard CD: If your disc will be used on older Macs using
System 7 or earlier — those before Mac OS 8.1 — you should use this
standard disc.
 Mac OS Extended CD: Macs running Mac OS 8.1 or later can take advan-
tage of the Extended file system, which allows faster performance and
provides a bit more room on the disc for your data.

Therefore, if compatibility is in question, always use the Mac OS Standard CD
version of HFS because both older and newer Macintosh operating systems
can read it. (Also, as you see later in this chapter, some types of discs require
the Mac OS Standard CD file system.)
To record a simple data disc with files from your Macintosh’s hard drive:
1. Double-click the Toast icon on the desktop to launch the program and
display the stylish Toast screen shown in Figure 9-1. (Talk about classy!)
2. Click the Data tab at the top of the screen.
3. To select which type of data disc you want to record, click the
Advanced button on the Disc Options drawer (in the upper-left).
Toast displays the different types of discs that you can record in the
selected category. For a basic Macintosh-only data disc, you should
enable the Mac Only option. By default, Toast records a Mac OS
Extended CD; to record a Standard HFS CD, click the HFS Standard
check box to enable it.
To hide or display the Disc Options drawer, click the button to the left
of the Data tab. (In Figure 9-1, it appears to the left of the words “Mac
Only” — in the main Toast screen, not in the Disc Options drawer.)
4. Drag and drop files and folders from the Finder window into the Toast
main window.
The Record button
Figure 9-1:
Didn’t I tell
you that
Toast is a

program?
156
Part III: Hang On — Here We Go! 

Note that the program keeps track of both the number of files in your
layout and the approximate amount of space that it uses on the disc.
(Check out that nifty gas gauge bar graph that encircles the Record
button!) You can toggle between CD and DVD displays on the usage bar
graph display by clicking the CD or DVD button next to the Record
button.
5. Repeat Step 4 until you have added all your files and folders or until
the disc layout is filled to capacity.
You can click and drag filenames to move them into and out of folders,
just as you would in the Mac OS X Finder window when you’re using List
view. To add a new folder, highlight the parent folder (or the CD itself)
and click the New Folder button at the bottom of the screen. To remove
a file or folder — just from the layout, mind you, not from your drive —
highlight the unwanted item and click Remove at the bottom of the
screen. Figure 9-2 illustrates a typical disc layout that I have created
on my system.
6. Load a blank CD into your recorder.
7. Click the Big Red Record Button.
8. The Record dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 9-3.
If you need more than one copy of the disc, click in the Number of Copies
field and type the desired number. By default, Toast selects the highest
recording speed that your drive supports.
Figure 9-2:
Ready to
record with
Toast!
157
Chapter 9: A Step-by-Step Guide to . . . Toast?

9. Click the Advanced button at the top of the dialog box.
Here, you determine whether you want to finalize (or close) the disc:
• To write a single session and leave the disc open for later record-
ings, make sure the Close Disc check box is disabled. (This action
is the same as selecting the Finalize Session, Don’t Finalize CD set-
ting in Easy CD & DVD Creator.) You can read the disc in your Mac’s
CD-ROM drive, but you can create a multisession disc by using this
disc in the future.
• Enable the Close Disc check box to write the session and finalize
the disc so that it can’t be written to again. This action corresponds
to selecting the Finalize CD setting in Easy CD & DVD Creator.
You can choose to test the recording by enabling the Simulation Mode
check box, but note that this selection does not automatically record the
disc if the test completes successfully.
If your Mac’s recorder supports burnproof recording — and all Macs
made in the last three years or so do — make sure that you enable the
Buffer Underrun Prevention check box. With Buffer Underrun Prevention
turned on, you can continue to use your Mac while it’s burning without
fear of ruining the disc. Sassy!
10. Click Record.
While recording, Toast displays a progress bar. After the recording is
complete, the program automatically verifies the finished disc against
the original files on your hard drive. Because this process takes several
minutes, you have the option of ejecting the disc immediately and skip-
ping the verification step.

Part III: Hang On — Here We Go! 

Recording an Audio CD
Although Apple has released programs like iTunes that can burn audio discs,
I still prefer to record audio CDs on the Macintosh with Toast; it gives more
choices and more control over the finished disc. To record an audio CD from
files on your hard drive and existing audio CDs, follow these steps:
1. Double-click the Toast icon on the desktop to launch the program.
2. Click the Audio tab at the top of the screen.
3. Add tracks in either of two ways:
• Add existing sound files you have already saved to your hard
drive: For example, drag AIFF or MP3 files to your layout by drag-
ging the files into the Toast window.
• Add tracks from an existing audio CD by loading it into your
CD-ROM drive and double-clicking the disc’s icon on the desktop
to display the track icons: Drag the desired track icons from the
audio CD window into the Toast window. (These tracks have a tiny
CD icon to indicate they’re being ripped from an existing audio CD.)
If you plan to copy the majority of tracks from an existing CD, just drag
the entire disc icon to the Toast window, and you can load all the tracks
at one time.
4. To create an MP3 music disc with the MP3 files you’ve added, enable
the MP3 Disc option in the Disc Options drawer.
If the Disc Options drawer is hidden, click the button to the left of the
Data tab. Naturally, you can add only MP3 files to an MP3 music disc
project.
5. You can rearrange the tracks in any order you want by dragging them
to their new positions. To rename a track, click on the track name to
highlight it and click again to open an edit box. Type the new name.
To hear a track, highlight the track name and click the eminently
familiar-looking Play button at the bottom of the screen. To remove a
track, select the offending track and click Remove. Finally, you can
change the length of the pause before a track by clicking the current
value — by default, it’s two seconds — and choosing a new value from
the menu.
If you’re using files from an existing audio CD and you only have one
optical drive on your Mac system, you have to export (a more dignified
word for rip) any tracks you’re copying from other discs before you
record your new audio CD. This export step eliminates any possible
problems that your drive may encounter if you try recording directly
from the discs themselves.
159
Chapter 9: A Step-by-Step Guide to . . . Toast?

6. Highlight each track you have added from another disc and click the
Export button at the lower-left of the Toast window.
Toast displays a Save As dialog box that allows you to pick the folder
where the extracted audio is saved. The tracks are saved as AIFF files.
7. Load a blank CD-R into your recorder.
8. Click the Big Red Record Button, which displays our old friend the
Record dialog box.
9. For a standard audio CD, click the Advanced button and make sure
that the Close Disc and DAO (short for Disc-at-Once) options are both
enabled.
10. Click Record.
I swear that this is the last time I say this — it really is, folks — do not use a
CD-RW when recording a standard audio CD unless you’re sure that the audio
CD player supports rewriteable media! Using a CD-RW in an older audio CD
player that doesn’t support rewriteable media will likely result in stark silence
(and a blinking error message from your CD player). If you do actually hear
anything, your CD player is probably producing something that sounds like
an enraged moose. (And yes, for you Monty Python fans, a moose once bit
my sister. . . .)
After your audio CD has been recorded, you can regain hard disk space by
deleting the extracted audio tracks you saved. Or, if the notion is attractive
to you, keep them for another recording, or use them with your iPod.
Ooh! It’s a Hybrid!
Next, turn your attention to an important type of disc that’s easily recorded
with Toast: a PC/Macintosh hybrid disc that can be read on both systems.
The Mac portion of the disc uses the HFS file system, and the PC portion uses
either Joliet or ISO 9660. This disc type is a perfect way to distribute files and
programs to a wide audience, especially games, educational material, clip-art
libraries, multimedia files, and fonts (all of which are often shared between
PCs and Macs).
Note that unless you’re running special software, only the native format por-
tion of the disc can be read by either operating system. (Geez, I need a soda.
In plain English: The Macintosh can read only the Mac information on the
disc, and the PC can read only the PC portion. Sorry about that.)
160
Part III: Hang On — Here We Go! 

To create a hybrid disc, follow these steps:
1. Gather the Mac-only files you want to record and move them to a sep-
arate volume (either a separate hard drive partition or a removable
disk, like a Zip disk or a temporary partition, which I show you how
to create in the next section).
If you have any files that should be visible on both Macs and PCs, copy
them to the volume as well.
2. Double-click the Toast icon on the desktop to launch the program.
3. Click the Data button at the top of the screen.
4. Click the Advanced button in the Disc Options drawer, and then
select the Custom Hybrid option. Toast displays the screen shown
in Figure 9-4.
If you’re just looking for a single disc offering one set of files that both
types of computers can read, eschew the Custom Hybrid format: Instead,
click the Basic button on the Disc Options drawer and choose the Mac &
PC option. This format creates a simple cross-platform disc that can be
read on both Macs and PCs. A Mac & PC format disc is only suitable for
sharing simple data files. Unlike a true hybrid disc, a Mac & PC format
disc doesn’t support any operating system specific features for either
type of computer.
5. Click the Select Mac button.
Figure 9-4:

161
Chapter 9: A Step-by-Step Guide to . . . Toast?

6. From the Select Volume dialog box, click the volume that you created
in Step 1 in the list and enable the Optimize on-the-Fly check box.
Click OK to return to the main screen.
7. Click the Select ISO button to display the ISO 9660 dialog box, as shown
in Figure 9-5.
8. Drag and drop to the ISO 9660 dialog box the files that should be read
on the PC.
You can click on the CD title or a folder name to rename it — files are
automatically renamed to conform to the ISO standard. Click the New
Folder button to add a new folder, and feel free to drag files and folders
around to rearrange your ISO layout.
9. After you’re finished adding ISO files, click the Settings tab. From the
Naming drop-down list box, select Joliet (MS-DOS + Windows), which
allows long filenames. Click Done.
10. Okay, let’s burn this puppy! Choose File➪Save As Disc Image. Toast
prompts you for a location to save the image file. (I generally pick the
desktop because it’s easy to find.) Click Save to create the image.
11. Click the Copy button at the top of the screen. This time, select the
Image File button from the Disc Options drawer.
12. Click the Select button, choose the image you created in Step 10, and
click Open.
13. Load a blank disc into your recorder.
14. Click the Big Red Record Button.

the verification step.
Let Your Video Do the Talking
Toast 6 Titanium allows you to create your own Video CDs, Super Video CDs
and DVD-Video discs — after a fashion, that is. Unlike iDVD, you don’t have
creative control over menu creation and what goes where — Toast does it
automatically — but if you’re looking for basic transportation for your digital
video clips and digital photographs, you can’t get much easier than this
application!
163
Chapter 9: A Step-by-Step Guide to . . . Toast?
Mounting an image (and not on the wall)
From time to time, you may want to take advan-
tage of the absolutely nifty ability to mount a
disc image on the Mac OS 9.2/X desktop, just
like it was a gen-u-wine piece of CD-ROM hard-
ware. You can open the mounted disc and even
run programs and load files from it. Your Mac
applications can’t tell the difference, and you
don’t have to dig through dozens of CDs to find
the one that holds the files you need. (You are
likely to use a mounted disc image only for data
discs because you can listen to audio tracks
just by extracting them as AIFF or MP3 files.) As
long as you have the available hard drive terri-
tory, you can keep a disc image on tap for any
contingency.
To create a disc image, build your data CD
layout as usual, as I describe earlier in this
chapter. (Make sure that you have at least
800MB or 900MB of free hard drive space if your
image will reflect a full disc.) Then, rather than
burn the layout, choose File➪Save As Disc
Image. From the Save Disc Image As dialog box,
click on the target folder in the list to select it,
type a new name (if necessary), and click Save.
Toast acts just as though it’s writing to a disc;
when it’s done, however, you have a brand-
spanking-new disc image file.
To mount the file, double-click it. Toast auto-
matically launches and presents you with two
buttons: Select and Mount. Click Mount, and
you’re ready to go. (After the volume icon
appears on the desktop, you can quit Toast.) The
mounted volume stays on your desktop until you
reboot your Macintosh or drag the volume icon
to the Trash. Enjoy!

Video CDs (commonly called VCDs) can be shown on your computer with
the proper VCD player application; most standalone DVD players can also
handle Video CDs. Super Video CDs (or SVCDs), on the other hand, display
significantly better video quality, but there’s a caveat or two: An SVCD stores
less than a VCD, and most older DVD players won’t recognize the format.
Therefore, use the Video CD format whenever possible to ensure the best
possible compatibility.
To create a Video CD or Super Video CD, follow these steps:
1. Double-click the Toast icon on the desktop to launch the program.
2. Click the Video button at the top of the screen.
3. Click the Advanced button in the Disc Options drawer, and select the
Video CD or Super Video CD option.
If you’re creating a disc for use in the United States, make sure you
choose the NTSC option.
4. To add basic menus to the disc automatically, enable the Create VCD
Menu check box.
Personally, I leave this option disabled and simply allow the video clips
to run sequentially — remember, the more video clips you add, the more
cumbersome (and harder to navigate) your menus become.
I always recommend that you click the Video Quality drop-down list box
and select High quality — you get less recording time on the disc, but
the video on the finished disc looks much better.
5. Drag and drop video clips to the content window (see Figure 9-6).
Alternatively, you can click the Add button to select the video clips from
a standard Open dialog box. To remove a clip that arrived by accident,
select the clip and click Remove.
To import digital video directly from your DV camcorder, plug it in —
Toast displays a DV camcorder icon in the content window. Click Import,
and sit back while Toast creates the video clip! (Just make sure you have
enough hard drive space to hold the imported clip . . . the digital world
can get cumbersome.)
6. Add photographs (or an entire folder of photographs) from your hard
drive by dragging them into the content window.
You can drag images from a Finder or iPhoto window; Toast labels a
folder as a slideshow and displays the number of images each slide-show
contains.
Here’s a neat trick: Click the Advanced button in the Disc Options drawer,
and enable the Add Original Photos checkbox. Toast will create a sepa-
rate folder on the final disc that will contain all of the photos that you
add to your VCD/SVCD project. When you load the disc into a computer,
164
Part III: Hang On — Here We Go! 

you can copy those images directly from the disc onto the computer’s
hard drive. (If you use this feature, your discs will both display and store
your images!)
7. Load a blank disc into your recorder.

Chapter 9: A Step-by-Step Guide to . . . Toast?
Can I burn DVD-Video discs with Toast?
Yes, Virginia, Toast can handle basic DVD
projects — however, don’t expect many frills.
(Forget creating fancy animated menus and
embedded content.) I recommend that you take
the easy route, and follow the same steps I used
for VCDs and SVCDs. You’ll end up with a DVD-
Video disc that plays video clips and slideshows
on your computer and DVD player . . . but you
won’t be able to directly manipulate the con-
tents of the VIDEO_TS folder. A DVD movie must
conform to the DVD-Video standard, which
uses a very specific set of directories (and is
recorded in UDF format). If that sounds like
ancient Sumerian to you, there’s no need to
read any more of this sidebar!
Hey, you. Yeah, you, the DVD wizard who wants
to burn a DVD-Video disc. Actually, you can
hotwire Toast to produce a bona fide DVD-Video
disc with your own VIDEO_TS files. (Forgive me
if I get a bit technical here for the DVD wizards.)
You need to burn the project as a data disc
instead, and you have to prepare the contents
of the VIDEO_TS folder separately, because
Toast doesn’t allow you to directly author DVD
content.
To create the necessary layout, click the Data
tab, and click the Advanced button in the Disc
Options drawer — pick the DVD-ROM (UDF)
option, and then drag your prebuilt VIDEO_TS
folder into the content window. (Remember,
most older DVD players also require an
AUDIO_TS folder for everything to work, even if
the AUDIO_TS folder doesn’t contain anything.)
Now you can burn the disc. Naturally, I recom-
mend that you use a DVD-R for the best possible
compatibility with all DVD players.

8. Click the Big Red Record Button . . . and wait.
Unfortunately, digital video takes time to encode (a fancy-pants term that
describes the conversion of your digital video into a form that can be
recorded). How much time? Well, pardner, that depends on the size of
the video clips, the quality setting you’ve chosen, and the speed of your
Mac — but don’t be surprised if you can take a break for lunch before
the Record dialog box appears.
9. Finally! Click the Advanced button and make sure that the Close Disc
option is enabled.
10. Click Record and relax.
Project: Creating a Temporary Partition
As I mention earlier in this chapter, while discussing custom hybrid discs,
recording with Toast sometimes requires you to create a temporary partition
as a separate volume on your Mac desktop. In fact, you can use the Mac
Volume disc type to record the contents of a temporary partition as a com-
plete disc.
In the following steps, I show you how to create a temporary partition to
store the Macintosh files for a hybrid disc:
1. Double-click the Toast icon on the desktop to launch the program.
2. Choose Utilities➪Create Temporary Partition to display the Create
Temporary Partition dialog box, as shown in Figure 9-7.
3. Click the Name field and enter a volume name for the partition.
In this example, I chose Fortisque. (I have my reasons.)
Figure 9-7:
With a
temporary
partition,
I feel 
so . . . self-
contained.
166
Part III: Hang On — Here We Go! 

4. Click the Size field and enter a partition size in megabytes (the default
is 650MB).
Naturally, this size can’t be larger than the amount of free space on the
drive that you select in the On drop-down list box. I have only about
150MB of Mac files to record on this hybrid disc, so I show you how to
create a 160MB partition on my hard drive. Leaving about 10MB of breath-
ing space on your temporary partition is always a good idea. This allows
you to add a forgotten file or two more without running out of room.
5. If you need a Mac OS Standard disc, select it from the Format drop-
down list box.
6. Click OK.
As you can see in Figure 9-8, Fortisque has suddenly appeared on my
Mac Desktop.
Don’t you wish that it was that easy to add permanent storage space to
your system?
After the partition has been created, you’re ready to drag your Mac files
into it.
After you’re done with the partition, you can delete it by dragging it to the
Trash.
Figure 9-8:
Ah,
Fortisque,
there 
you are!

Chapter 9: A Step-by-Step Guide to . . . Toast?

Project: Recording a Backup DVD-ROM
Toast can burn with DVD-R/W and DVD+R/W drives, so it makes a good quick-
and-dirty recording program for creating backups. The storage space on a
DVD-R makes backing up a decent-size drive easy, using only three or four
discs. You don’t get a full 4.7GB — a 4.7MB disc provides only about 4.25GB
when you use the Mac OS Extended format — but it’s still nothing to sneeze at.
You, too, can burn a simple DVD-ROM backup for your hard drive files. Follow
these steps:
1. Double-click the Toast icon on the desktop to launch the program.
2. Click the Data tab.
3. Click the Advanced button in the Disc Options drawer and enable the
Mac Only radio button.
When you’re backing up data, compatibility with other computers usu-
ally isn’t a big deal. Therefore, I heartily recommend that you enable the
Compressed check box in the Disc Options drawer. To safeguard your
data, you can also enable the Encrypted option, which will prompt you
for a password. Security is a good thing, but here’s a stern Mark’s Maxim:
Brothers and sisters, if you can’t supply that password, you
won’t be able to read anything from the disc!™
4. Click and drag the desired files and folders into the content window.
5. Load a blank DVD-R into your DVD recorder.
6. Click the Big Red Record Button, which presents our old friend the
Record dialog.
7. Click the Advanced button and make sure that the Close Disc option is
enabled.
Because a backup is such an important procedure, I also recommend
that you enable the Verify Data check box. Toast takes additional time
to check the disc after the recording is complete, but isn’t your peace
of mind worth that extra step?
8. Click Record and grab another soda.
Note that Toast can also write a data layout to a DVD-RAM, but the entire disc
is automatically reformatted first, and the data is recorded as a read-only disc.
If you want to record data to the disc again using Toast, you lose the current
contents of the disc when it’s reformatted. Sorry about that — but then, if
you’re using a DVD-RAM drive for backups, like I do, automatic reformatting
really isn’t a problem!

Using Drag-to-Disc:
Avoid the Hassle!
In This Chapter
 Formatting discs for use with Drag-to-Disc
 Adding files to a Drag-to-Disc project
 Ejecting and using Drag-to-Disc discs
 Adding new files to a Drag-to-Disc project
 Restoring Drag-to-Disc files
 Recording an employee disc with Drag-to-Disc
O
kay, I trumpet the advantages of the Roxio Drag-to-Disc throughout the
first half of this book, and it’s time to deliver the goods. What makes
Drag-to-Disc so hot? Here are the facts:
 You have no need to open any recording software ahead of time. Just
drop a Drag-to-Disc disc in your drive, and everything’s taken care of
for you automatically.
 The Universal Disk Format (or UDF) recording mode — also known as
packet writing — used by Drag-to-Disc is almost as reliable and foolproof
as burnproof recording. You can safely record data on a Drag-to-Disc disc
while you’re working in another application under Windows.
 You can add files at any time without creating a multisession disc.
 Drag-to-Disc works with CD-Rs, CD-RWs, DVD-R/Ws, DVD+R/Ws, and
DVD-RAMs.
 All popular operating systems can read a UDF disc.
Eager to find out more? This is the chapter for you — I put Drag-to-Disc
through its paces.

“Whaddya Mean, I Have to Format?”
Hey, I didn’t say that Drag-to-Disc is perfect, did I? This program has only two
drawbacks:
 You have to format a disc before you can use it.
 You can’t create mixed-mode or standard audio CDs with Drag-to-Disc.
I can’t do anything about the latter — Drag-to-Disc prompts you to launch
Creator Classic if you’re moving digital audio files to your disc — but the pro-
gram automatically formats a disc for use with Drag-to-Disc when you drag
files to it within Windows Explorer.
If your drive doesn’t support this automatic formatting option (or if you want
to use compression, which I cover in a paragraph or two), you can follow
these steps to manually format a blank disc in Windows XP:
1. Load a blank CD-R or CD-RW into your recorder.
2. Choose Start➪All Programs➪Roxio Easy CD & DVD Creator 6➪Drag-
to-Disc to display the Drag-to-Disc window shown in Figure 10-1.
You can also double-click the Drag-to-Disc icon in the system tray to dis-
play this screen.
3. Press Alt+F to display the Format Options dialog box shown in
Figure 10-2.
4. It’s time to give your disc a name. Enter in the Volume Label field a
descriptive volume name that has 11 characters or fewer.
You see this label displayed in the same places as your hard drive names,
including Windows applications, within Windows Explorer, and within
My Computer.
Figure 10-1:
All roads to
Drag-to-
Disc start

170
Part III: Hang On — Here We Go! 

If you suddenly decide to rename your Drag-to-Disc disc later — if you
change your significant other, for example — click in the Drag-to-Disc
window and press Alt+R, and then type the new name.
You can also choose to use compression on your Drag-to-Disc disc, which
means that files can be reduced in size and you can pack additional stuff
on the disc. Woohoo! Roxio says that the compression ranges anywhere
from 1.5:1 to 3:1. As with a Zip archive, the compression you achieve
depends on the data you’re adding to the disc. I like to enable this check
box because the more space I have to add files, the better. However, this
action can limit the number of computers that can read the disc, as you
find out from my description of the Eject options later in this chapter.
Don’t use compression if you want any computer to be able to read 
the disc!
To read a compressed Drag-to-Disc disc on another computer, you have
to have either Drag-to-Disc installed or you have to install UDF support
(which is already included on most PCs running Windows 2000 and
Windows XP).
5. If you’re formatting a rewriteable disc, select the Format type by click-
ing the desired option.
Drag-to-Disc offers two types of formatting for rewriteable media. Quick
formatting takes only a few minutes, but you must have Drag-to-Disc
installed to read the disc. Full formatting can take up to 90 minutes
(depending on the speed of your drive and the capacity of the disc),
but the resulting disc can be read on any PC running Windows 2000 or
Windows XP, even if Drag-to-Disc is not installed on that machine.
6. Click OK to set the wheels in motion.
Drag-to-Disc displays the dialog box shown in Figure 10-3 while it’s
working.
When the disc has been formatted, Drag-to-Disc displays the volume
name in the Drag-to-Disc window, which you see in Figure 10-4.
Figure 10-2:

Chapter 10: Using Drag-to-Disc: Avoid the Hassle!

Double-click My Computer, and you can see your new drive. Although it
appears to be a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM, it’s ready to store data and read it.
The Drag-to-Disc icon in the Windows system tray now sports a fashionable
miniature red padlock, which tells you that you have loaded a Drag-to-Disc
disc.
Depending on the brand and model of your recorder, you may not be able to
eject a Drag-to-Disc disc using your drive’s Eject button like you can with a
regular read-only disc. Don’t worry, though: I cover the procedure for safely
ejecting a Drag-to-Disc disc later in this chapter.
Just Add Files and Stir
“So what programs do I run to use a Drag-to-Disc disc?” Programs? You don’t
need ’em! Drag-to-Disc works behind the scenes, so you can forget that it’s
there. Just read, create, copy, and move files to your Drag-to-Disc disc in the
same way you use your hard drive or a floppy disk. You can save to the disc
within your applications, drag and drop files, or use a file management pro-
gram like Windows Explorer.
You can also keep tabs on the status of your Drag-to-Disc disc by checking its
Properties page: Double-click My Computer to display your drives, right-click
the Drag-to-Disc drive icon, and choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
Figure 10-5 shows the Properties for the disc that I show you how to format in
the preceding section.

Part III: Hang On — Here We Go! 

As you can see, the file system is listed as Drag-to-Disc-R, with compression
enabled. You can see that this disc has approximately 719MB of free space
remaining. Remember, though, that it’s a guesstimate because the rate of
compression can vary depending on the type of data you’re storing.
That’s it! Of all the recording programs I cover, Drag-to-Disc is definitely the
easiest to master: There’s literally nothing to it.
“Wait — I Didn’t Mean to Trash That!”
When you delete files from a Drag-to-Disc CD-RW, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, or DVD-
RAM, the files are deleted and you recover the space those files used. When
you delete files from a CD-R, DVD-R, or DVD+R Drag-to-Disc disc, the files are
no longer accessible, but you don’t regain the space.
Unfortunately, you can’t undelete files from a Drag-to-Disc project by using
the Windows Recycle Bin — after they’ve been deleted, those files are long
gone, pardner. If a Drag-to-Disc project disc is damaged or corrupted, how-
ever, you can use ScanDisc to attempt to recover the files from it — more in
the section “Whoops, I Can’t Read This Disc” later in this chapter.

Chapter 10: Using Drag-to-Disc: Avoid the Hassle!

Eject, Buckaroo, Eject!
A Drag-to-Disc disc has one side that’s a little tricky: You may not be able to
simply eject a Drag-to-Disc disc like any other mundane CD-ROM or DVD-ROM.
(In fact, the Eject button on your recorder may be disabled!) Drag-to-Disc has
to take care of a few housekeeping tasks, like updating directory entries and
preparing the disc for reading.
Go ahead and give the Eject button a poke, but if it doesn’t work, you can
always follow these steps to eject a disc by using the Drag-to-Disc window:
1. Right-click the Drag-to-Disc icon in the system tray to display the pop-
up menu, and then choose Eject Disc.
Alternately, display the Drag-to-Disc window (as I show you earlier in
this chapter in the section “Whaddya Mean, I Have to Format?”), and
click the Eject button. You can also right-click on the drive icon in the
My Computer window and select Eject.
If you’re using a non-rewriteable disc, Drag-to-Disc displays the Eject
Disc dialog box that you see in Figure 10-6. You can enable or disable
three check boxes to determine how the disc is prepared when it’s
ejected:
• To read the disc on a computer with UDF support (or Drag-to-Disc
installed): Disable the Make This Disc Readable on Any CD or DVD
Drive check box. The disc is closed so that computers that can read
UDF version 1.5 can read the disc — this includes Windows 2000,
Windows XP, Mac OS 9.2, and Mac OS X. With this option, you can
either leave the disc open so that you can write more to it later, or
you can enable the Protect Disc So That It Cannot Be Written to
Again check box (which I describe in a second) to finalize the disc
permanently.
• To read the disc on any computer: This option creates an ISO 9660
disc that can be read on just about any computer. (Note, however,
that you can’t use this option if you have elected to compress the
data on the disc.) Again, you can leave the disc open and write to it
again later, or you can enable the Protect Disc check box to finalize
the disc.
• To allow further recording: If you want to continue recording
later (for example, you need to read something else or record an
audio disc with Creator Classic and you need the drive), disable
the Protect Disc So That It Cannot Be Written to Again check box.
You can’t read the disc on anything other than a recorder running
Drag-to-Disc, however, so it’s effectively out of commission until
you reload it.
174
Part III: Hang On — Here We Go! 

2. Click OK to eject the disc.
Depending on the option that you chose, you may have to wait while the
disc is finalized, but Drag-to-Disc shows you a progress dialog box to let
you know how things are going.
Do you usually pick the same Eject options for your CD-Rs, DVD-Rs, and
DVD+Rs? If so, you can choose an Eject setting that Drag-to-Disc will apply
to all discs in the future. Click the Drag-to-Disc window and press Alt+S to
display the Settings dialog box, then choose the desired Eject settings. Click
the Advanced Eject Settings button to specify whether non-rewriteable discs
should be prepared with the UDF 1.5 or ISO 9660 file format, as I described
earlier in this section.
Adding Files to an Existing Disc
If you have ejected a non-rewriteable disc, you can reload it and write addi-
tional data as long as
 You didn’t choose the Protect Disc So That It Cannot Be Written to Again
check box.
 Additional space remains on the disc.
When you reload a non-rewriteable Drag-to-Disc disc, the program may have
to open a new session and read the files that it already contains. This process
can take a few moments, depending on whether you decided to close the disc
or leave it as is. However, after the disc is back in the drive, you can use it
normally.

Chapter 10: Using Drag-to-Disc: Avoid the Hassle!

Erasing a Drag-to-Disc Disc
Like Creator Classic (which I explore like Jacques Cousteau in Chapter 8),
Drag-to-Disc allows you to completely erase CD-RW, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, or
DVD-RAM media. To erase a disc:
1. Click in the Drag-to-Disc window, or right-click the Drag-to-Disc icon in
the system tray to display the pop-up menu.
2. Click Erase Disc from the pop-up menu.
Drag-to-Disc requests confirmation that you really want to erase the disc.
3. Click Yes.
Sit back while the disc is erased, or go grab yourself another soda.
“Whoops, I Can’t Read This Disc”
In case something nasty occurs and you encounter problems with a Drag-to-
Disc disc (for example, if you’re hit with a power failure while copying files to
the disc), the program offers a ScanDisc feature that can recover files and fix
some errors. Note that this program should not be confused with Windows
ScanDisk, which is used only with hard drives and floppy disks.
To scan a Drag-to-Disc disc for errors, follow these steps:
1. Click in the Drag-to-Disc window, or right-click the Drag-to-Disc icon in
the system tray to display the pop-up menu.
2. Click Launch ScanDisc.
Drag-to-Disc displays the dialog box shown in Figure 10-7.
Figure 10-7:
Running
ScanDisc
on an ill
Drag-to-
Disc disc.
176
Part III: Hang On — Here We Go! 

3. Click Scan to begin. 
Drag-to-Disc provides a progress bar while it works. If the program finds
problems, you’re prompted for confirmation before the program gathers
recovery information.
4. Click Yes to continue. (Naturally, this is a definite choice.)
If files can be recovered, ScanDisc allows you to copy them to another
drive. 
5. Click the Destination Drive drop-down list box to select the target
drive, and then specify the target folder in the Destination Folder list.
6. Click Copy to attempt to recover all files and folders.
Each recovered file is renamed with a generic filename, so you have to open
each file manually to determine what it is, and if it was recovered successfully.
(I know this stinks worse than an angry skunk in a closet if you have dozens
of files, but there’s no other choice. Such is technology.)
Project: Creating a New-Employee Disc
Here’s the deal: Suppose that you work in the human resources division of
your company and it’s your job to provide new employees with all the infor-
mation they need. However, your office doesn’t have an intranet (that’s
another book entirely), so you hit on the idea of a New Employee CD-ROM
that contains all sorts of company clip art, press releases, document tem-
plates, and the company president’s recipe for Heavenly Hash Browns. Your
coworkers often take these discs on business trips, too. Your discs are popu-
lar because they save plenty of hard drive space on laptops.
That’s a great idea, but it has one problem: Your company is continually
requesting that new material be added to the discs, and some information is
soon out of date and needs to be deleted to make sure that it doesn’t get
included in a company document accidentally. You need a way to add more
data to a disc and be able to selectively delete information whenever you
want. Hey, that’s the definition of a CD-RW Drag-to-Disc disc! Follow these
steps to create the perfect employee disc:
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪Roxio Easy CD & DVD Creator 6➪
Drag-to-Disc to run Drag-to-Disc.
2. Load a blank CD-RW into your recorder.
3. Press Alt+F to format the disc (as I demonstrate in the section
“Whaddya Mean, I Have to Format?” earlier in the chapter).
Depending on your recorder, you could do this automatically . . . but this
disc may need compression to hold that huge hash browns recipe.
177
Chapter 10: Using Drag-to-Disc: Avoid the Hassle!

4. Name the disc (ACMECO, for example), and because you’re assuming
that all computers in your company are running Drag-to-Disc or using
an operating system that recognizes UDF discs, enable compression to
make room for as much data as possible.
5. Click OK.
6. After the disc is formatted, double-click the My Computer icon on your
desktop. Drag to the recorder icon all the company files that you want
to add to the disc to copy them.
After all the files have been recorded, it’s time to eject the disc.
7. Right-click the Drag-to-Disc icon in the system tray and choose Eject
from the pop-up menu.
Pass the disc with pride to your next new employee — and whenever you need
to update the contents of the disc, just pop it back in the drive and start copy-
ing and deleting files!

“A
ll right, troops — if you have been following along in this book, you
know that I’ve been easy on you. I’ve covered the simple stuff, and
you can burn simple data discs and audio CDs until the cows come home. But
what if you need to burn a mixed-mode disc? Or record favorite albums and
cassettes on audio CDs? Or even record a DVD for use in your DVD player?
Those are heavy-duty recording jobs, Private. Have you got what it takes?”
Of course, you do. Luckily, those are the specialized discs that I cover in this
chapter! You may not use them often, but when you do, you can hold your
head up high and say, “I know how these are made. Step aside, and let the
expert show you how it’s done.”

It’s Data, It’s Audio, It’s Mixed!
Ever felt like you need both digital audio and computer data on the same
disc? If so, consider mixed-mode format. You can burn two different types
of mixed-mode discs — the one you select depends on the material you’re
recording and what device will play it.
Putting data before your audio
I mention standard mixed-mode discs in Chapter 7. They’re great for discs
that need to combine both digital audio and computer data, but aren’t meant
to be used in a standard audio CD player. These discs can be played only in a
computer’s CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive.
Typically, the program is installed from the first track (the data portion), which
is closest to the spindle hole. After the program is running, it plays the audio
tracks that follow: That’s why most sophisticated computer games now use
mixed-mode format: because the game program can load movies and data files
from the first track and still access the digital audio tracks while you’re blasting
the aliens from Planet Quark.
The extra behind CD Extra
As you can see in Figure 11-1, a CD Extra disc turns regular mixed-mode
format on its head: One or more audio tracks come first, followed by a data
track. The big attraction here is for musicians; a CD Extra disc can be played
in both a standard audio CD player (which really can’t tell the difference
because the data is at the end) and a computer’s read-only CD-ROM or DVD-
ROM drive. This, folks, is the definition of neat!
Groups such as the Rolling Stones, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and the Squirrel
Nut Zippers have popularized the CD Extra disc with their fans. Although the
format costs a minute or two of disc space (the blank space that’s necessary
to separate the tracks), the band’s music can share the disc with a multimedia
presentation of the latest music video or still pictures of a recent concert —
or even lyrics to the songs.
182
Part IV: So, You’re Ready to Tackle Tougher Stuff? 

Doing Vinyl with AudioCentral
AudioCentral is the all-encompassing audio player, editor, and recording
application that ships with Easy CD & DVD Creator 6. It involves a little more
work than copying an audio CD or recording a new disc from MP3s. In effect,
you can consider AudioCentral’s analog recording feature (which is part of
the AudioCentral Sound Editor program) to be the bridge between your exist-
ing music collection (vinyl albums, cassettes, and even antique media, like 
8-track cartridges and reel-to-reel tapes) and the permanence and sound
quality of audio CDs. With the right equipment, you can transfer the music
from all these types of old recordings to a brand-new audio CD format.
However, let me make one thing perfectly clear: I recommend analog recording
with AudioCentral for only those recordings in your collection that aren’t already
available on audio CD. In other words, using AudioCentral’s Sound Editor to
back up your Boston albums is simply ridiculous! Here’s why:

Chapter 11: Heavy-Duty Recording

 Too much effort: Why go to the trouble of remastering material that’s
already available on audio CDs? It’s much easier to jump online or walk
down to your local record store to pick up a copy of that Police album
on audio CD.
 Subpar sound quality: Here’s an easy-to-remember Mark’s Maxim that
never steers you wrong: 
No matter how good your equipment is and how well you have treated
your old media, the sound that you achieve is never as good as a pro-
fessionally mastered audio CD.™
 Less than visually striking: Unless you spent a bundle on a compact disc
screen printer, your finished disc doesn’t look as good as a commercial
disc (and it doesn’t have those liner notes or that flashy jewel case liner).
“Okay, Mark — exactly when should I use AudioCentral’s Sound Editor for
recording?” I would say that if your recording fits these criteria, it’s a prime
candidate for recording with AudioCentral:
 Unavailable on audio CD: The college band you loved so much that
didn’t hit the big time — perhaps it produced an album or a cassette,
but those never become 1s and 0s (zeros) without your help.
 Rare or live recordings: The one time that Frank Zappa jammed onstage
with Ella Fitzgerald? Burn it, and then please send me a copy! I would
pay a pretty penny for that one.
 Personal recordings of you, your family, and your friends: Your grand-
parent’s family history, or the soundtrack to your 16th birthday party,
which your dad recorded.
To use Sound Editor’s analog recording features, you need the assistance of
your home stereo and the original equipment (sorry, this program’s good,
but it can’t play that 8-track cartridge by itself), and you have to make a cable
connection or two. Although I cover the procedure in the section “Project:
Recording an Album to CD” at the end of this chapter, you need to connect
your stereo’s amplifier or tuner to your computer’s sound card input jacks.
Because computer sound card hardware varies widely between manufactur-
ers (some cards may even need special cables), check the documentation
that came with your sound card to determine how to do this.
Adding Effects in Sound Editor
While I’m discussing AudioCentral’s Sound Editor application, I should also
mention that the program allows you to tweak and improve your older record-
ings while you’re remastering them to audio CDs. For example, you can make
use of effects like these:
184
Part IV: So, You’re Ready to Tackle Tougher Stuff? 

 Room Simulator: Where a stereo widening or “shrinking effect is added
to music
 DeTuner: Where that persistent background hum can be eliminated
(unless it’s part of your 1960s music and it’s actually part of the song)
 DeClick: Where you can clean older, low-fidelity recordings of annoying
pops and clicks
I show you how to make use of the audio effects in the section “Project:
Recording an Album to CD,” later in this chapter.
Giving Your Disc the Boot
I think I’ve created only one or two bootable discs in my entire burning
career — but when you need one, they’re absolutely critical. (In both cases,
I had to create bootable discs to take care of hardware problems with PCs
that wouldn’t boot. The drivers, programs, and data that I had to store
wouldn’t have fit on a floppy, either.) A bootable disc contains everything
that your computer needs to complete the loading of a specific operating
system. In most cases, the operating system is DOS, Windows, or Linux —
including the required hardware drivers for things like your mouse and your
CD-ROM drive.
Here’s a great stumper for the next so-called computer guru that you meet who
claims to know all things binary: In the Windows world, a bootable disc con-
forms to the El Torito standard. Of all the strange names I’ve encountered in my
computer travels, that one even beats the acronym TWAIN (which stands for
Technology Without An Interesting Name)! My editor’s favorite Mexican restau-
rant was also named El Torito — hopefully, though, they didn’t burn anything
there.
Let me be honest with you: Creating a bootable CD-ROM is not an easy matter,
so it’s a project for experienced computer owners. Gathering all this stuff takes
careful planning because just a single missing line in your boot files can render
the entire disc useless. For this reason, it’s good news that Easy CD & DVD
Creator requires you to create a floppy boot disk that it can import into your
data layout. If your computer can boot from the floppy disk, you know that it
can do the same with your bootable CD-ROM. (You can also create a bootable
hard drive image and then use that to record, if your hard drive is working.)
I show you how to create a bootable disc later in this chapter. If you decide to
record one, make sure that the computer you use it on supports booting from
a CD-ROM. Most PCs built in the past three or four years can use a bootable
CD-ROM; check your PC’s manual. If the documentation doesn’t cover this
185
Chapter 11: Heavy-Duty Recording

option, follow the instructions provided in your PC’s manual to display the
BIOS settings and look for a bootable CD-ROM option. (Some older, first-
generation DVD-ROM drives don’t recognize a bootable DVD-ROM. Luckily,
I don’t think PC owners need quite that much emergency space yet.)
Creating an Optical Photo Album
Every photo album is optical, of course — but when I use the word, I mean
a photo album that’s recorded on a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM. The photos in an
optical album can be displayed on your computer monitor, saved to your
hard drive for use in your documents, or — if you would rather have an old-
fashioned hard copy — printed on your inkjet or laser printer.
Easy CD & DVD Creator 6 is thoughtfully accompanied by an excellent Swiss
Army knife for your digital images: Roxio’s PhotoSuite 5, which you can find
at www.roxio.com. You can use PhotoSuite to create optical photo albums
and slideshows (with your digital photographs) and video postcards (with
your digital video). If you have a Web site, the program can even create cata-
log pages for your photographs. A visitor to your site just has to click a thumb-
nail to display the full-size image.
I show you in this chapter how to use PhotoSuite to create an optical photo
album that can display your images in a slideshow. See the section “Project:
Recording a Photo Disc,” later in this chapter.
Recording that MTV Video
The last advanced specialized disc that I discuss is the Video CD (commonly
called a VCD), which stores digital video in MPEG-1 format. You can watch a
Video CD in a Video CD player, a computer CD-ROM drive (with the right soft-
ware) and most of the latest generation of DVD players. Before the advent of
DVD players, Video CDs were the primary method of recording and distribut-
ing digital video among computer owners. An enhanced version of the Video
CD — called the Super Video CD, or SVCD — provides even better video qual-
ity, but an SVCD stores less than a VCD, and SVCDs aren’t compatible with all
DVD players.
Easy CD & DVD Creator uses a combination of a separate program named
DVD Builder to help simplify the creation of a video CD. With DVD Builder,
you can burn a professional VCD, SVCD, or DVD, complete with a basic menu
system — and I lead you through the process step-by-step in the last project
in this chapter.

Part IV: So, You’re Ready to Tackle Tougher Stuff? 

Project: Recording an Album to CD
I’m the proud owner of a special record album: Batman and Robin, recorded
in 1966 on the Tifton label and performed by “the sensational guitars of Dan
and Dale.” You may not believe this, but the guy at my local record shop says
that he doubts this classic LP will be released on compact disc any time soon!
(In fact, he said something about “a snowball’s chance” — I didn’t catch the
rest.) I have two choices: Either I can continue to play the album and listen to
it deteriorate over the next few years, or I can master that music to an audio
CD and enjoy it in digital splendor for the next century! (If you think that I’m
choosing the former option, you’re reading the wrong book.)
Remember that your computer’s sound card must be connected to your
stereo’s amplifier or preamp before you can begin. Follow these steps to
master an album to an audio CD:
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪Easy CD and DVD Creator 6➪
AudioCentral➪Sound Editor to display the screen that you see in
Figure 11-2. (Sorry, Mac owners, but both AudioCentral and Sound
Editor run only under Windows.)
Figure 11-2:

187
Chapter 11: Heavy-Duty Recording

2. If you’re lucky enough to have multiple sound cards in your PC,
choose Tools➪Recording Device to choose which card to use, and
then choose the desired sound card from the pop-up submenu that
appears.
3. Choose Tools➪Recording Source. Sound Editor displays a pop-up sub-
menu listing all audio inputs (or sources) for this recording; choose
the desired source.
By default, Sound Editor uses the slightly wacky “What U Hear” set-
ting, which means that the program records what you hear through
your stereo’s speakers . . . and this is what you need for this project.
However, you can also choose other sources, like a microphone or a
MIDI synthesizer.
4. Turn on your stereo system and start playing your album.
Optionally, recall the days when the LP was considered state-of-the-art
and high-fidelity. Speculate on the future of audio media, and wonder
what everyone will be using to record music in another decade.
5. Click the Enable Record Mode button (which sports a microphone) at
the bottom of the Sound Editor window.
6. Drag the Recording Level slider so that the input level meters remain
green through most of the music, with an occasional foray into the
yellow portion of the meter.
If the music that you’re recording varies quite a bit in volume, make sure
that the strongest and loudest passage of music lights the entire green
portion of the level meter
7. Okay, here’s the fun part: Start your album over at the beginning and
immediately click Record.
Sound Editor creates a WAV format sound file in your Clips directory.
Don’t know where your Clips directory resides? By default, it’s the
My Music folder within your My Documents folder. However, you
can change this location by specifying your favorite folder within
AudioCentral: Choose Tools➪Options, and then click the CD Options
tab to display the settings shown in Figure 11-3. Click the Change
button in the Copy Settings section, select the desired location on
your system, and then click OK. Click OK on the Options dialog to
return to AudioCentral.
8. When the album is over, click Stop (the button bearing that attractive
square) at the bottom of the Sound Editor window.
9. Click the Enable Record Mode button (which sports a microphone) at
the bottom of the Sound Editor window.
188
Part IV: So, You’re Ready to Tackle Tougher Stuff? 

10. If you like, you can also apply some effects to your new recording.
Choose Edit➪Select All, and then choose Tools➪Apply Effect to
Selection.
Sound Editor displays a settings dialog box for the effect you’re adding
(like the Room Simulator dialog box, shown in Figure 11-4), where you
can fine-tune the effect to your taste.
11. Choose File➪Save Playlist to assign an artist and album title to the
audio file that you just created, and click Save.
That’s it! You can now exit Sound Editor and listen to your new digital audio
files with your favorite MP3 or WAV player. After you’re satisfied with the
results, follow the instructions in Chapter 8 for recording a typical audio CD
from MP3 and WAV files.
Wow, Dan and Dale never sounded so good! Next, I think I’ll try that live boot-
leg album of the Dick Nixons.

Project: Recording a Bootable CD-ROM
Suppose that you work as a computer repair technician for a company and
you want to create a test CD-ROM that can boot an absolutely clean (or
default) installation of DOS or Windows. You include diagnostics programs
on this CD-ROM, so it becomes a basic software-toolkit-on-a-disc for your
travels throughout the building. (If this sounds like firsthand experience,
believe me — it is!)
This situation is the perfect time to use a bootable CD-ROM. As long as all
your company’s computers can use a bootable disc, you can guarantee your-
self a stable environment (what techies call a vanilla boot) for diagnosing
troublesome hardware toys.
This type of disc requires more preparation than the others that I cover in
this chapter, and I strongly recommend that only experienced PC owners and
technicians should attempt to burn a bootable CD-ROM. With that said, you
should prepare a floppy disk that boots your system with exactly the same
configuration as you want for the bootable CD-ROM. Make sure that it con-
tains the CD-ROM driver, too!
Follow these steps to create your bootable disc:
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪Easy CD and DVD Creator 6➪Creator
Classic to run the program.
2. Choose File➪New Project➪Bootable Disc.
Creator Classic opens the dialog box that you see in Figure 11-5.
Things can get really hairy really quickly at this point — although you
can create several exotic types of bootable CDs, I stick with the easiest
(and most compatible) type.
3. Click the Bootable Disc Type drop-down list box and select Floppy
Disk Emulation (1.44MB).
Leave everything else on this dialog box as is.
Figure 11-4:

Part IV: So, You’re Ready to Tackle Tougher Stuff? 

4. Load into your 1.44MB floppy drive the floppy disk that you have pre-
pared and click OK.
After churning for a few seconds while the system files are read, the
bootable CD-ROM layout shown in Figure 11-6 appears. Note the two
files that have already been added to the layout: BOOTCAT.BIN and
BOOTIMG.BIN must not be erased or moved! They’re the files that make
this puppy bootable.

191
Chapter 11: Heavy-Duty Recording

5. If you just want the disc to boot your PC (without reading additional
files from the disc), you can skip ahead to Step 8. Otherwise, you can
locate and highlight more data files by using the same method that
you use to select files for a data CD-ROM (which I demonstrate in
Chapter 8).
6. Click Add (the arrow pointing downward in the middle of the window)
to add the files and folders to the data portion of the layout.
7. Repeat Steps 5 and 6 until you have finished adding files to the layout.
8. Click the Big Orange Disc-on-Fire Button and start the recording as
you would any other data CD-ROM. (Again, for more information on
the settings available when recording a data disc, you find the details
in Chapter 8.)
Project: Recording a Mixed-Mode Disc
Suppose that you need to record a selection of multimedia clips to carry with
you on a business trip — some are video clips that you need to store only for
the ride, but some of the clips are digital audio that you need to hear to prac-
tice your presentation. One solution would be to burn two discs — one, a data
CD-ROM for the video clips, and the other, a traditional audio CD. A mixed-
mode disc, however, allows you to combine both these types of content on a
single disc.
Follow these steps to create a mixed-mode CD:
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪Easy CD and DVD Creator 6➪Creator
Classic to run the program.
2. Choose File➪New Project➪Mixed-Mode CD to display a special mixed-
mode layout shown in Figure 11-7.
Make sure that the data CD icon is selected at the lower-left side of the
screen, under the Mixed-Mode CD Project label — it looks like a tiny disc
with a file folder. (By default, Creator Classic assigns the data portion of
your disc with a string of numbers for a name, but you can change that —
more on this in the step or two.)
3. Locate and highlight the data files by using the same method that you
use to select files for a data CD-ROM. (For the details on selecting files,
visit Chapter 8.)
4. Click Add (the downward-facing arrow in the middle of the window)
to add the files and folders to the data portion of the layout.
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 until your data layout is complete, as shown in
Figure 11-8.

Chapter 11: Heavy-Duty Recording

Don’t forget to click the data CD label and name the data portion of the
CD-ROM something descriptive. (Alternately, you can type the new name
directly into the Disc Name text box.) The default name, which is built
by using the current date and time, is rarely what you want.
6. Click the music CD icon next to the Empty Audio CD Project label
(lower-left side of the screen) to add the digital audio tracks. (The icon
looks like a disc with a musical note.)
As you can see in Figure 11-9, the lower-right portion of the screen
changes to the familiar audio CD track layout.
7. Locate and highlight the MP3, WAV, or WMF digital audio files that
you want to record, just as you do in designing a standard audio CD.
Remember to watch the free-space display at the bottom of the screen
to make sure that you don’t run out of space while adding audio files.
8. Click Add (that’s the down arrow in the middle of the window) to
copy the files to your track layout.
9. Repeat Steps 7 and 8 until your audio track layout is complete, as
illustrated in Figure 11-10.
Figure 11-9:
Whoa! Now

194
Part IV: So, You’re Ready to Tackle Tougher Stuff? 

10. Click the Big Orange Disc-on-Fire Button and finish the recording, just
like with a typical data CD-ROM. (Consult Chapter 8 for information
on selecting options for a data CD-ROM.)
Project: Recording a CD Extra Disc
As you may have guessed, I could also have created the disc that I showed
you how to burn in the preceding project by using a CD Extra disc. Like a
mixed-mode disc, a CD Extra (or Enhanced) disc can hold the same unique
combination of digital audio tracks and computer data. The big difference 
is that you can play the audio tracks from a CD Extra disc in your standard
audio CD player, and you need a computer’s CD-ROM drive to access the digi-
tal audio on a mixed-mode disc. That’s great for adding that video of your
garage band to that Best of Deep Purple disc you burned!
Follow these steps to record a CD Extra disc:
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪Easy CD and DVD Creator 6➪Creator
Classic to run the program.
Figure 11-10:
I think this

195
Chapter 11: Heavy-Duty Recording

2. Choose File➪New Project➪Enhanced CD. Again, Creator Classic
has a special layout screen for a CD Extra project, as illustrated in
Figure 11-11. If the music CD icon (next to the Empty Audio CD
Project label at the lower left of the screen) isn’t already selected,
select it now.
3. Locate and select the MP3, WAV, or WMF digital audio files to record,
just as you do in designing a standard audio CD.
4. Click Add (that familiar down arrow in the middle of the window) to
copy the tracks to the audio CD portion of the layout.
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 until you have added all the audio tracks that
you want.
6. Click the volume label for the data CD icon at the left side of the
screen and change the label to something descriptive. Type the new
label into the Disc Name text box.
196
Part IV: So, You’re Ready to Tackle Tougher Stuff? 
Documenting your CD Extra discs
CD-Text is a nice feature that allows many audio
CD players to display the CD title and the artist
and track names while you listen. That’s all that
most people need. However, a CD Extra disc
can store even more reference information
describing the audio tracks, including the artist
name, CD title, and publisher. If your audio CD
player can’t show this additional stuff, your
computer probably can when you play the disc
in your CD-ROM drive.
If you want to store this extra information, 
you must enter it after you have added your
tracks (see Step 5 in the section titled, “Project:
Recording a CD Extra Disc”). Choose File➪
Project Properties, which displays the Project
Properties dialog box, and click the Enhanced
CD tab to display the dialog box shown in 
the following figure. Click the Created and
Published drop-down boxes to select dates
from a miniature calendar; the other fields can
be entered by just clicking in the field and typing
away. Click OK to save the information that you
entered and return to the CD Extra layout.
Personally, I don’t use these fields, and you
don’t have to enter any of this stuff — but the
fields do come in handy when you’re recording
a disc that will be used as a master for a manu-
facturing run, or a disc that will form part of an
ongoing archive.

Leave the CDPLUS and PICTURES folders as they are. Don’t delete these
folders or add files within them, because they’re used in conjunction
with the audio tracks on the disc! (You can find out more about this
topic in the nearby sidebar, “Documenting your CD Extra discs.”)
7. Locate the files and folders to add in the usual manner by using the
Explorer display in the upper half of the screen, and highlight them.
8. Click Add (that handsome arrow pointing down in the middle of the
window) to copy the selected files and folders to the data portion of
the layout.
9. Repeat Steps 7 and 8 until all the files that you want are added.
Figure 11-12 shows a finished data layout for your CD Extra disc.
Note the location of the data files in the layout.
10. Click the Big Orange Disc-on-Fire Button and finish the recording as
you would with a typical data CD-ROM.

3. Click the Add Photos button from the panel at the left of the window.
PhotoSuite displays the thumbnail-laden Add dialog box that you see in
Figure 11-15.
4. Navigate to the folder that holds the images you want to add to the
album. Click an image to highlight the filename; to add multiple
images, hold down the Ctrl key while you click. Click Add to add the
selected images to the album.
Figure 11-16 shows the thumbnail display for an album.
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 until you have added all the images that you
want to include on your photo disc.
To view an image in full-size mode, double-click the thumbnail image.

At this point, PhotoSuite allows you to name your slideshow presenta-
tion, change the default delay of 5 seconds between slides, and add a
single digital audio file (in WAV, MIDI, WMA, or MP3 format) that plays in
the background during the show (see Figure 11-18).
You can also record a track from an existing audio CD, or record your
voice with a microphone. Click the Record button, and then choose a
recording quality setting (and, if you’re ripping a song from an audio CD,
choose the perfect track). After the recording is complete, you can listen
to it before you decide whether it should be saved to disc.
If you’ve packed a large number of images into your layout (or you’ve
added a huge sound file) and you’re a little worried about the elbow-
room on your Video CD, click the Calculate Disc Size button to display
the approximate space that you’ve used so far. You should be able to

Project: Recording a DVD Movie Disc
To end this chapter on advanced recording, I show you how to create a DVD-
Video of a child’s birthday party. Suppose that you edited a series of short
video clips with Adobe Premiere and you’ve saved them in MPEG format on
your hard drive. The DVD should show the clips in order.
Follow these steps:
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪Easy CD and DVD Creator 6➪DVD
Builder to load the program. As shown in Figure 11-21, the wizard
runs automatically. Select the Create a DVD Builder Project radio
button and click Next to continue.
2. Click the button for the type of disc that you want to create — a VCD,
SVCD, or DVD-Video disc — for this project, and then click the Import
Files button to use existing digital video clips from your hard drive.
Click Next.
Note that you can also capture a digital video stream from a DV cam-
corder or analog input (like a VCR). If you’re adding still images to your
project, you can also include existing images from your hard drive, or
capture digital photographs directly from your digital camera. For right
now, just add existing video clips, but you can switch to these other
sources whenever you like. Sassy!
3. The Import Files dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 11-22. Navigate
to the folder in which you stored your MPEG files and digital photo-
graphs. Hold down the Ctrl key and click the desired clips and images,
and then click the Add Files button.

Chapter 11: Heavy-Duty Recording

DVD Builder automatically checks the quality of each clip, and alerts you
if a clip is not well-suited to a VCD, SVCD, or DVD project (see Figure 11-23).
If a clip is tagged as okay for a particular kind of disc, you get a green
light — if it’s likely not to work, you get a red light. (Software designers
get paid a lot of money for ideas like these.) You can choose to add an
offending clip to your project anyway (with the idea of burning a disc
type that can use the clip) or just click Cancel and not add the clip at all.
4. Click the Add Anyway button (if necessary), and DVD Builder adds
the item to your disc layout as a thumbnail-size icon.
Note that the layout has two sections, as shown in Figure 11-24: the Intro
section on the top right, which contains a cool, old-fashioned count-
down reel clip by default, and the Main Menu section on the bottom
right, which displays a button for each movie clip that you add as a

separate item. (Hence the tabs for Movie A, Movie B, and so on.) A single
item can hold multiple video clips and still images, depending on where
you drag the thumbnail.
5. Add the rest of your clips and still images: Click one of the buttons at
the top of the DVD Builder window (Video Capture, Image Capture, or
Import Files). Naturally, if you want to use existing files from your
hard drive, click Import Files and repeat Steps 3 and 4.
Note that DVD Builder keeps track of the amount of space that you’ve
used with a bar display at the bottom of the window. You can toggle the
estimated space between the different types of discs by clicking the Disc
Size Status button at the left of the bar; click the type of disc that you
want to record, and the status bar changes to reflect the capacity of the
specified disc type.
Not quite sure about the contents of a video clip? Just double-click the
clip’s thumbnail icon to watch it in the Preview window, complete with
the familiar controls from a typical DVD player program — these include
pause, advance/rewind one frame, and jump to the next chapter (if your
clip contains discrete chapter markers).
If you add a clip or image by mistake, right-click the item to display
the pop-up menu and choose Delete to remove the element from your
project.

6. Now drag each item into the desired frame. To automatically create a
new menu button on the Main Menu screen, add the item to the next
empty Movie tab. To add an item to the sequence for an existing
button, drag the item to the empty frame at the end of the sequence.
Who wants a spiffy menu with a title like Main Menu or button captions
that read Movie A and Movie B? Double-click the Main Menu thumbnail
icon (directly under the words Main Menu, to the right of the Movie A
tab), and it appears in the Preview window — now you can click any
text item, and DVD Builder displays the dialog box that you see in Figure
11-25. If you like, you can even change the look of the text item by click-
ing the Select Font button and selecting a different font from the list that
appears. When your text looks just right, click OK, and the change is
reflected in the Preview window.
7. Before committing your project to disc, click the Change Menu Themes
button at the bottom of the DVD Builder window. A scrolling strip
appears at the bottom of the window (see Figure 11-26). Double-click 
a theme thumbnail to apply it to your project. 
If you decide you like the original theme, just click the first thumbnail in
the strip, and all will be as it was.
8. Ready to preview your disc? Click the Preview icon to view the entire
sequence — it’s the button with the TV and tiny remote control at the
bottom right of the DVD Builder window.
The program displays the high-tech control panel that you see in Figure
11-27, complete with familiar controls like the buttons on a DVD player.
You can navigate by using the buttons on the control panel, or just click
directly on your menu buttons with your mouse pointer. To display the
Intro sequence again, click the Intro button at the top of the control panel.

9. When you have finished your preview, click the Close button on the
control panel (the button with the X at the top right corner) and click
the Big Orange Disc-on-Fire Button to continue.
From the Burn Project dialog box (which you see in Figure 11-28), you can
select which type of disc you want to record. In most cases, you want to
burn your project immediately, but you can also create a disc image for
later recording.
10. To record now, click the radio button for the type of disc that you
want, load the correct type of media (a CD-R, DVD-R, or DVD+R —
always use a write-once disc for use in a DVD player), and click OK to
display the familiar Record Disc Setup dialog box.
11. Finish the recording as you would do for a standard data disc layout,
as I describe in Chapter 8.

BAM! Add Menus to Your Discs!
In This Chapter
 Determining whether you need a disc menu system
 Designing your menus for ease of use
 Using HTML for your disc menu system
 Adding animation to your menus
 Creating an HTML disc menu
 Converting text documents into HTML
Your cell phone uses a menu. Your computer programs use menus. Some
cars now use menus to display information to the driver. I’m sure that
someone somewhere is trying to add a menu to bathroom fixtures — all in
the name of those two powerful deities, Convenience and Ease of Use. (And
as a dedicated owner of that most necessary of machines, The TV Remote
Control, I’m all for convenience and ease of use!)
In this chapter, I show you how you can add a professional-looking point-
and-click menu system to your recorded data CD-ROMs and DVD-ROMs —
without spending a fortune on strange programs, dedicating half of next year
to learning any strange scripting language, or hiring some strange program-
mer for half of next year’s income to do it for you. (If you like, you can send
your thanks to mark@mlcbooks.com — there’s nothing better than e-mail
from happy readers!)
Everything Uses Menus These Days
Can you imagine buying an application or a game program, installing it, and
discovering that it had no menu system? Why, you would think that our civi-
lization had returned to the archaic Dark Ages of DOS, with commands you
had to type by hand. That’s why I add, for one reason or another, a menu to
about half the discs I burn. I think that any disc that falls into one of the fol-
lowing categories needs a menu onboard to make it, well, more convenient
and easier to use.

(By the way, I still remember about 90 percent of those archaic DOS com-
mands. Who knows when I may need them again, but I’m too nostalgic to
forget my first PC operating system!)
Discs chock-full of images, 
video, and sounds
If you want to display digital photographs, play sound clips, or show video
clips, you have come to the right place. Hypertext Markup Language (or HTML
for short) provides support for all these files, and they sound and look as
nice as they do when you receive them over the Internet (just much, much
faster). Whoops, I almost forgot: You can add cool extras, like Flash anima-
tion, Adobe Portable Document Format (or PDF) files, and Java applets to your
HTML menu, too.
Discs burned to distribute to others
Convenience and ease of use are both doubly important when you’re recording
a disc for distribution. As a shareware author, I can attest that what seems to
you like a piece of cake to use can be a hunk of lead the size of an anvil to a
computing novice. For example, rather than try to figure out what program
to run and where it is on your disc, your customer may decide to chuck your
demo CD-ROM into the trashcan.
Besides making your disc easier to use, an HTML menu system allows you to
pull out all the stops for a professional first impression: Your menu can make
liberal use of graphics, music, and even video (without requiring a connection
to the Internet) while providing the point-and-click functionality everyone
wants. A multimedia menu tends to draw people; as anyone in advertising
can tell you, using eye candy helps to deliver the message.
Discs with Internet links
If an Internet connection is available, your discs can offer direct links to your
online Internet presence. You can take visitors directly to your Web site, 
prepare an e-mail message that’s automatically addressed to you, and load
resources from your Web server (like the latest program update or your
latest newsletter in PDF format).
212
Part IV: So, You’re Ready to Tackle Tougher Stuff? 

Discs with text files galore
If you take the time to convert your text into HTML (which I demonstrate to
you later in this chapter), you can display them directly within the friendly
confines of a Web browser, complete with links to other documents, search
commands, and basic text formatting.
Discs that include a Web site
Yes, Virginia, you can indeed store an entire Web site on a disc, complete with
every graphic, sound, and animation found on the Internet site. (The only thing
that would have to be left by the wayside would be streaming video because it
requires a connection to the Internet for you to download.) Because Netscape
Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer, and Apple Safari can all load a Web page
from a CD-ROM or a hard drive rather than from a Web server, anyone with a
browser can visit your site — just by loading your disc.
Discs with dozens and dozens of folders
If your disc has only one or two folders, no big whoop (although you’re still
betting that the person who has your disc knows how to use Windows Explorer
or will read your printed instructions). But what if your disc has nested direc-
tories three or four levels deep and that person has to dig for a specific piece
of clip art or a certain Adobe Acrobat PDF file?
With an HTML menu, you can provide hyperlinks that automatically open
these files or download them directly to the computer’s hard drive for later
use — no digging, no searching and, very likely, a satisfied customer.
Designing Menus (But Not for Food)
What’s the secret to designing a good menu? What elements should it have?
Of course, the appearance of your menu is completely up to you — and the
flexibility of HTML makes it easy to add a menu that’s as flashy or mundane
as you like. However, I can provide you with a few guidelines that apply
equally well to any disc menu:
 Plan your menu in advance. Before you run your HTML editor, sit down
with a piece of paper and a pencil (remember those?) and write down
precisely what commands your menus should include and how many
menus you need. For example, if you need only an e-mail link, a couple of
text links, and a download link, you can place all those on one menu. If
213
Chapter 12: BAM! Add Menus to Your Discs!

you’re selling different products and you want each to have its own
page, make notes of what commands each page needs.
 People like consistency. Think of the best sites that you find most attrac-
tive on the Web: I bet that each site has its own graphic design elements
(like buttons, separation bars, fonts, and incidental graphics) that set it
apart. Those elements work only when they’re used consistently, so
avoid a hodgepodge of different looks. Also, decide ahead of time what
common controls should be on every page. For example, if your menu
has more than one page, don’t forget to plan the navigational controls
you need. As with a standard Web page, you need links to advance a
single page or send your user back to the home page — and it’s a good
idea to add a link to back up a single page, too.
 “What’s my motivation?” Okay, sorry about the actor-speak. Ask your-
self what kind of an impression you want to make on the people using
your disc. Do you need the multimedia pizzazz, or would your purpose
be better served with a simple menu and a few animated images? If you’re
recording a disc just for reference purposes, for example, your family,
friends, or customers probably don’t need anything fancy — clarity and
speedy retrieval are more important. A demo disc that offers a product,
on the other hand, may pull out all the stops and offer plenty of eye candy.
 How will the information be used? Will the information on your disc be
viewed directly within the browser (like a PDF or HTML text file), or do
users have to download programs and data to their hard drives first? It’s
always a good idea to add text to your menus that helps guide novices if
something has to be done.
Whether your menus are plain and simple, somewhat attractive, or downright
Hollywood, they must be arranged in a logical manner. If your disc offers 
primarily a catalog of images, why put the links to the sample images on a
secondary menu? Your menu system should save as many mouse clicks as
possible, so it’s always helpful to “put the best stuff in the window.”
Using HTML for Your Menus
HTML (short for Hypertext Markup Language, as though anyone really worries
about it anymore) is just plain neat. When it was first developed, it was her-
alded as the beginning of a new age of communication as the foundation of the
World Wide Web; and indeed, it has proven to be exactly that. HTML could rest
on its laurels for the rest of history, known as nothing but the cornerstone of
the Web.
214
Part IV: So, You’re Ready to Tackle Tougher Stuff? 

But a great concept like HTML is hard to contain to a single facet of the com-
puting world: Software developers and engineers have this funny habit of
using something that works well in ways that the original designers would
have never considered. For example, HTML has now become the basis of
today’s disc-based help and documentation; many applications, utilities, and
games now ship with no printed manual. The entire manual is saved in HTML
format to the disc itself. (In fact, that was what prompted me to develop my
first HTML menu for a disc, sometime back in the hoary days of 1996: I was
fascinated by my first experience with an on-disc HTML manual.)
So why does HTML make such a good foundation for a disc menu system?
Reflect, good reader, on these facts:
 Free, free, free! That got your attention, didn’t it? Not only are Web
browsers generally free, but you can also choose from a wide range of
free HTML editors (with a generous handful of inexpensive shareware
editors around to boot). Probably the best known of these HTML editors
is Microsoft Front Page. Even programs like Microsoft PowerPoint and
Word can create simple Web pages.
 It’s available on everything. HTML is such a pervasive force these days
that every operating system either displays it or includes a browser;
that includes the Big Three (Windows, the Mac operating system, and
Linux) as well as strange and wonderful beasts like BeOS, OS/2 Warp,
and Solaris. Because operating systems now install a Web browser auto-
matically, you’re also virtually assured that your customers can use your
menu. If, in some cosmic irregularity, they haven’t installed a browser,
you can even include the distribution versions of Netscape Navigator or
Microsoft Internet Explorer on the CD itself.
 Friends and customers already know how to use it. These days, the
vast majority of folks already know how to use their Web browsers, and
those browsers can automatically display common multimedia file for-
mats; no need to manually run external programs. (I know a friend who’s
uncomfortable with any programs other than Outlook Express and
Internet Explorer, and even he could use your disc.)
 A complete menu toolbox. HTML has evolved into a powerful language,
complete with tools to display formatted text; search that text for spe-
cific words and phrases; play movies, music, and sounds; display images;
link files; copy files from disc to hard drive; send e-mail; and visit other
Web sites. Whew!
 A normal person can understand HTML. Compared to a serious program-
ming language like C or Visual Basic, understanding HTML is a walk in the
park. To be honest, you really don’t need to study it anyway because a
good HTML editor can create a menu without your writing a single line
of code. (For example, I use Netscape Composer in the menu project at
the end of this chapter.)
215
Chapter 12: BAM! Add Menus to Your Discs!

 You can use third-party plug-ins to add even more features. Need
Flash animation for your HTML menu? How about specially written Java
applets? (If you don’t know what either of these is, feel free to ignore
them.) If you can program in Java or you have an application to build
Java applets for you, your menus can run these toys with a click of a
mouse (or automatically with the menu).
“So how do I add the menu system I create to my disc layout?” That’s the sim-
plest part. The HTML files that you create (along with the files they use, like
graphics and sounds) are copied to a separate folder that you create in your
CD layout. The person using your disc can open the folder manually and
double-click the top-level HTML menu file, or you can create a shortcut (in
Windows) or an alias (in the Mac operating system) in the root directory that
loads the top-level menu.
While I’m discussing HTML within specific margins in this chapter, you can
find out all the details of the language and what it’s capable of in the book
HTML 4 For Dummies, 4th Edition, by Ed Tittel and Natanya Pitts (published
by Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Mentioning Animation
If you’re interested in animating your menus, I recommend these two methods:
 Animated GIF images: You can use Animation Shop 3 (from Jasc) to create
animated GIFs. It’s simple stuff, but all browsers can display them without
additional plug-ins, and they can add basic animation to a title or a back-
ground. Figure 12-1 shows Animation Shop 3 at work; it’s a steal at $40, 
and you can buy it directly from Jasc at their Web site (www.jasc.com).
 Macromedia Flash: Flash MX 2004, from Macromedia (www.macromedia.
com), is the standard for creating interactive animation for HTML pages.
Unlike with an animated GIF image, you can control what happens and
what runs when your customer clicks a Flash control or animation. Flash
animations can use sound, images, and graphics that you have drawn
yourself and imported from your favorite drawing program. If you have
visited a Web site recently that uses fancy drop-down menus, they were
likely created in Flash. The latest version even adds support for MP3
music.
Figure 12-2 illustrates the Flash design environment. Although Flash takes
some time to master and costs about $500, I often recommend it to folks who
are looking for professional-quality Web animation. If you take the time to
study the program, Flash can produce browser-based games, deliver interac-
tive education, and — oh, I forgot — create CD-ROM menus worthy of
Microsoft or Adobe.
216

For those with knowledge of HTML
I often make quick changes to Web pages with
Windows Notepad — it’s easy to modify a word
here or there or change the color of a font.
However, I use a CareWare HTML editor when
I’m designing or making major changes to an
existing page, and I can heartily recommend it
as a powerful addition to your HTML toolbox.
The program, Arachnophilia, was written by
Paul Lutus. You can download your copy at
www.arachnoid.com/arachnophilia/.
(It comes in flavors for all versions of Windows.)
Arachnophilia offers support for format tem-
plates, tables, keyboard macros, a global search-
and-replace feature, page frames, and much
more. It even includes a built-in ftp client for
transferring Web pages and files. The program
can display with its internal browser a preview
of a page you’re developing, too. The following
figure shows Arachnophilia at work on my per-
sonal Web site. Note that this is not a WYSIWYG
(short for What You See Is What You Get) HTML
editor per se (like Front Page), so you do need
knowledge of the HTML language.
(By the way, CareWare is a simple concept:
Simply repay the author with deeds of kindness
in your general area, and be thankful for what
you have. It’s a great program at a great price.)

Project: Creating a Disc 
Menu with HTML
Time to get your hands dirty with HTML. I show you how to create a typical
basic disc menu for a distribution CD-ROM that I can send to customers. The
program is Handsome Prince 2.0 (“Turns a regular guy into a mate fit for a
princess”), and you need to add these functions to your menu:
 A link to download the program from the disc to the computer’s hard
drive
 A link to the READ ME file so that it can be read directly from the disc
 A link to send e-mail
 A link to the program’s support Web site
Because the customer has already bought the program, you don’t need any-
thing flashy — a simple menu that offers fast access to the program and the
other links is perfect. I use Netscape Composer, the free HTML editor that
ships with Netscape Navigator (www.netscape.com), to show you how to
create the menu. Follow these steps:
1. Choose Start➪Programs➪Netscape 6➪Netscape 7.1 to run Navigator.
2. From the Navigator menu, choose File➪New➪Composer Page.
The Netscape Composer screen shown in Figure 12-3 appears.
3. First, select a title for the page: I typed Handsome Prince Version 2.0.
Click and drag to select the text, and then choose Format➪Font. I use
the Helvetica font. Choose Format➪Align, and choose Center from the
pop-up menu.
You now have a dramatic-looking title for the CD-ROM menu, as you can
see in Figure 12-4.
Now you create a line to separate the title from the rest of the menu.
4. Press Enter twice and choose Insert➪Horizontal Line to add the bar
(see Figure 12-5).

220
Part IV: So, You’re Ready to Tackle Tougher Stuff? 

5. Add the first link — a download link for a file (for example,
HPRINCE2.EXE). Click the Link icon on the toolbar to display the Link
Properties dialog box (see Figure 12-6) and type the link description 
(I used the words Copy Handsome Prince 2.0 to your hard drive) in the
Link Text box. Click the Choose File button to locate the file (make
sure that you select the All Files view in the Files of Type drop-down
list box at the top of the dialog box). Highlight the filename and click
Open. Click OK to create your first link, as shown in Figure 12-7.
Before you celebrate too much, though, you have to change the location
of the file you chose because that file will be on a CD-ROM rather than
on your hard drive. Right-click the link that you just created and choose
Link Properties from the pop-up menu. In the Link Location field, erase
the rather cryptic file location that Composer created and just type the
name of the file to download (in this case, hprince2.exe). Click OK to
save your changes. With this change, your browser looks for the file in
the same location as the HTML file itself, which is in the root directory
of the CD-ROM.
You may be wondering how the program is copied to the hard drive.
Because HPRINCE2.EXE is a binary application, your browser knows that
it can’t be displayed, so you receive instead the familiar prompts asking
whether you want to copy it to your hard drive. Neat, eh?

221
Chapter 12: BAM! Add Menus to Your Discs!

6. To display the formatted HTML READ ME file (which I show you how
to create in the next project), repeat Step 5.
For this example link, type the title Read the Handsome Prince 2.0
READ ME File in the Link Text box and select the README.HTM file from
the files and folders on your hard drive.
If you need to remove a link, highlight the link text by clicking and drag-
ging, and then choose Format➪Remove Link.

Part IV: So, You’re Ready to Tackle Tougher Stuff? 

7. Now you need the e-mail link. You enter this code directly: Choose
Insert➪HTML to display the dialog box that you see in Figure 12-8.
Type this text into the box:
<A HREF =”mailto:mark@mlcbooks.com”>Send An Email to the
Author of Handsome Prince</A>
8. Change the e-mail address (the part immediately following the
mailto:) to your address and click Insert.
Voilà! Your menu is shown in Figure 12-9 with its new e-mail link.
Again, things are about as automatic as they can get. If the computer
using your disc is connected to the Internet, clicking this e-mail link in a
Web browser connects the user’s computer to the Internet and displays
the user’s default e-mail program, complete with a new message already
addressed to you.
9. Press Enter twice and repeat Step 6 to create your Web site link. This
time, type this text:
<A HREF =”http://www.mlcbooks.com”>Visit the Handsome
Prince Support Site</A>
10. Change the Web address (the part immediately following the http://)
to your Web site address. Click Insert.
Your new disc menu now includes the basic functions (as shown in
Figure 12-10).

224
Part IV: So, You’re Ready to Tackle Tougher Stuff? 

Before you declare things finished, how about sprucing up the back-
ground a little bit?
11. Choose Format➪Page Colors and Background to display the dialog
box that you see in Figure 12-11. Enable the Use Custom Colors radio
button and click the Background color sample box. Composer displays
a grid of possible colors you can use. Select a color that coordinates
well with the black and blue of the text (like a light orange or gray),
and then click OK to change your background color.
12. To save your page, choose File➪Save As. Composer prompts you for
a title to be displayed on the title line of the Web browser; I typed
Handsome Prince 2.0 CD-ROM. Click OK. From the Save Page As dialog
box, select the folder where the menu should be saved. Type a descrip-
tive name (I suggest something like MENU.HTM) and click Save.
Because your files reside on a CD-ROM, you must make sure that the
locations of any linked files match the locations they have within the CD
layout. In the example, HPRINCE2.EXE must reside in the root directory,
just like the MENU.HTM and README.HTM files. If these files are in dif-
ferent folders, your download link doesn’t work.
13. To test your menu, open your browser, choose File➪Open to display
a standard Open dialog that lists the files and folders on your system.
Then locate and select the HTML menu file.
Figure 12-12 illustrates the menu as displayed within Internet Explorer.
Don’t forget to check all the links and make sure that they work.

Project: Converting a Text 
Document to HTML
Personally, I like viewing text as a file within a browser. It somehow seems
more of an elegant solution than just opening Windows Notepad. When you
need to show a text file within your CD-ROM menu, though, converting that
text to HTML becomes a requirement because no View a Text File command
exists. For a simple text file, like the READ ME file for Handsome Prince 2.0,
Microsoft Word makes the conversion easy.
Because Word does a simple conversion job, you have to use an HTML editor
to add graphics, add a table, or change a dotted line to a solid separator bar
(like the one you used in the preceding project). Even if you have to add
graphics and special formatting in another program, however, Word makes 
a great conversion tool for the text.
Follow these steps to convert a text file to HTML with Word:
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪Microsoft Word. From the Word menu,
choose File➪Open, which displays the standard File Open dialog with
the files and folders on your system. Navigate to the location of the
original text file and double-click to load it.
Figure 12-12:
Viewing 
the fruits of
your labor.
226
Part IV: So, You’re Ready to Tackle Tougher Stuff? 

Your text file should look something like Figure 12-13.
2. Because HTML text can be formatted with bold and italic text, take a
moment to change to either bold or italic any text that needs a little
emphasis. Select the text you want and click either the Bold or the
Italic button on the Word toolbar.
Avoid the Underline text attribute because it can be easily mistaken for a
link in the finished HTML file. Also, you don’t need to choose an alterna-
tive font because a simple HTML file uses the default font set by the
browser’s configuration.
3. After the text is italicized and bolded as you like, choose File➪Save
As. The Save As dialog box appears. Navigate to the location where
you want to save the file and choose Web page from the Save As Type
drop-down list box.
4. As shown in Figure 12-14, the Save As dialog box for a Web page has
an additional field that you should fill in. Click the Change Title
button and type a descriptive title. (The new title is displayed in the
browser window.) Click OK to return to the Save As dialog box.
Note that the title is not the same as the filename, which you should
enter now. I use the filename README.HTM, from the preceding project.
5. Click Save to begin the conversion.

hether it holds 90 minutes of digital video or it’s simply crammed full
of backup files, a DVD recordable disc is a wonderful thing — only cur-
rent prices are holding most technotypes back from investing in a DVD-R/W,
DVD+R/W, or DVD-RAM drive. But those prices have already fallen from $1,000
to less than $300 for a fast DVD-R/W drive, and the cost of blank media has
dipped more than 50 percent over the past two years. It’s simply a matter of
time until DVD recorders pack the shelves at your local discount store; they
will replace the CD-RW drives that are now standard equipment on today’s
PCs and Macs.
My job is clear: I must prepare you for the rigors of DVD recording so that
you’re ready for the coming wave of new hardware! It’s a daunting job, but,
well, it’s not really all that daunting. If you’re interested in backing up your
system or simply saving 4.7GB of data at once, burning a DVD is a process
similar to burning a CD-R or a CD-RW. I show you how in this chapter.
If you’re interested in mastering a DVD with digital video for use in your home
DVD player or your computer’s DVD-ROM drive, you are indeed walking into
an unfamiliar land — but this chapter shows you the way there!
Let me be honest with you (as always): This isn’t a book about either digital
video editing or DVD authoring. The topic for this particular tome is recording
CDs and DVDs, and I need all the space that my editors give me just to tackle
those topics! However, if the basic introduction to editing and authoring in this
chapter is enough to pique your interest, I recommend iMovie 2 For Dummies,
written by Todd Stauffer, and Digital Video For Dummies, 3rd Edition, written by
Keith Underdahl (both published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.).

What’s Involved in Recording 
a DVD-R or DVD+R?
In short, the same four things required in order to burn a CD-R are involved in
recording a DVD-R or DVD+R:
 A recorder
 A blank disc
 Your source material
 The appropriate recording software (either UDF/packet writing, a DVD
authoring program with built-in burning capabilities, or a full-blown mas-
tering program similar to Easy CD & DVD Creator or Nero 6)
With this close resemblance to the now-familiar process of CD recording, what
gives DVD recording that James Bond feeling — at least at the time this book
was written? Here are a number of reasons:
 Prices are still high. The painful side of DVD-R/W, DVD+R/W, and DVD-
RAM recording simply starts with the high cost of the drive. Then you’re
hit with the cost of the blank media! A single DVD-R sets you back $1 or
$2, and a typical DVD-RAM is a hefty $15. The higher the cost, the less
appealing DVD recording remains to average computer owners.
 DVD standards are still evolving. “Should I invest in DVD-RW, or is there
something just around the bend? Will my DVD player read the discs that
I record?” Unfortunately, far too many question marks still surround the
different DVD formats, and many computer owners are holding back
another six months to a year, hoping for one to become a clear winner.
 Perceived value. At this point, many folks just don’t feel that they need
the space offered by recordable DVD. DVD is attractive for digital video
and system backups, but 700MB per CD-R is still a fair chunk of territory
(at a mere pittance of a price, too).
 DV is only just becoming a mainstream technology. As DV camcorders
continue to drop in price and Uncle Milton decides to try out digital video
editing, DVD recording is sure to heat up (pun intended). Right now, the
analog camcorder and the VHS VCR are still King of the Mountain.
The Heavy Stuff: Introducing 
DVD Authoring
If you have been reading up on DVD technology, you know that DVD authoring
(that’s the process of creating an interactive DVD-ROM title, usually involving
230
Part IV: So, You’re Ready to Tackle Tougher Stuff? 

digital video, still images, and custom-written programs) and DVD burning go
hand in hand.
Authoring a disc involves a little bit of flowchart design (the creation of a logi-
cal menu system), a little bit of artistic talent (the development of a distinctive
look and feel for the buttons, images, and background), and at least a basic
knowledge of digital video. Of course, the DVD-Video discs that you buy at
your local video store are authored by professionals who use hardware and
software packages that cost many thousands of dollars. You may be surprised,
however, at the results that you can achieve with the right software, as you
see in the iDVD project at the end of this chapter. (My first DVD amazed my
family. After they played with the menu system for several minutes, I was such
a hit that I could have sold them oceanfront property in Kansas.)
Although the recording is only a small part of the authoring process, I want
to give you a small taste of two authoring programs. iDVD 3 is a free package
that’s exceptionally easy to use, and DVD Studio Pro 2 is a full-blown profes-
sional authoring package that sets you back $500. (If that’s not a wide price
range, I don’t know what is.) Both these programs were developed by Apple
(www.apple.com) and run exclusively on the Macintosh, but PC folks get
about the same treatment at the low-end price point with MyDVD 5 Deluxe
from Sonic for $70 at www.sonic.com. Coincidentally — wink, wink — MyDVD
works very much like iDVD 3. Go figure.
Welcome to the world of iDVD
iDVD 3, a Mac OS X application, ships with the current crop of high-end G4
and G5 Macs that offer the DVD-R SuperDrive. Because iDVD is aimed squarely
at novices, it has only a small selection of the more powerful features offered
by more expensive authoring applications. For example, iDVD automatically
creates your disc’s menu system, and you’re limited to full-screen video. But,
friends and neighbors, the kids at the local elementary school are now using
iDVD. It’s easy — and if it’s easy, normal people will try it!
DVDs created with iDVD are limited to displaying digital video and still
images (using a slideshow format). These displays are organized into media
folders (which, in turn, can hold subfolders). I especially like the fact that
discs created with iDVD take advantage of the DVD player remote control
(even though you don’t have to know anything about how your DVD remote
functions). It’s all taken care of automatically by iDVD, leaving you free to
concentrate on where to put what and how it should look.
An iDVD disc can contain up to about 90 minutes of digital video (DV) or a
combination of DV and slides. After you have completed your design, you can
use the program’s Preview mode to try out your disc before you burn it (com-
plete with a virtual remote).
231
Chapter 13: Storing Megastuff with DVD

For a guided tour through the process of creating a DVD-Video disc with
iDVD 3, check out the project at the end of this chapter.
Letting loose with DVD Studio Pro
On the other end of the spectrum, you have a heavyweight of DVD authoring:
DVD Studio Pro 2 includes commercial features, like Macrovision copy pro-
tection, support for today’s popular widescreen aspect ratio, a total of nine
possible camera angles, MPEG format support, region coding, and much
more. You have complete control over your menu creation, with layered
images taken from Adobe Photoshop. Unlike with iDVD, you choose what
actions are taken when the different buttons are pressed on the DVD player’s
remote control. Whereas iDVD 3 can use only one audio track — the audio
from the video itself — a high-end package like DVD Studio Pro allows as
many as eight tracks, so you can mix music with your DV.
As with iDVD, you get a Preview mode with DVD Studio Pro, so you can
double-check all your work before burning. Speaking of recording, that too is
supported internally. As extra options, you can also write your completed
project to a disc image or DLT tape.
If you’re already well-versed in digital video editing, you should feel right at
home using DVD Studio Pro 2 (and you should be better prepared for the
high prices for DV hardware and software). If you have just bought your
Macintosh and you have never shot a frame of DV, I recommend that you
pass on both the complexity and the price. This package will likely take you
places where you don’t want to venture, so stick with iDVD 3 (or, on the
Windows side, MyDVD 5).
Let UDF Do the Work
Here’s another of my patented Nuggets o’ Knowledge, a Mark’s Maxim for
rewriteable recording:
What works with CD-RW usually works just as well with DVD-RW or
DVD+RW.™
(Look out — you could soon see this catchy phrase on bumper stickers and
T-shirts.)
In this case, what works is Universal Disc Format — or UDF, otherwise known
as your old friend packet writing, which is compatible with Mac OS 9, Mac OS
X, and all versions of Windows 98 (and later). A number of great programs
are available for both Windows and the Mac operating system (OS) that
implement the Holy Grail of UDF. These applications allow you to use your
232
Part IV: So, You’re Ready to Tackle Tougher Stuff? 

recordable DVD drive as a 4.7GB floppy (isn’t that a mind-boggling idea?)
except that your DVD recorder is much faster and much more reliable and
holds a heck of a lot more.
For DVD packet writing, I use Roxio’s Drag-to-Disc, which I cover in stunning
detail in Chapter 10. Of course, you can also run the full-blown Easy CD & DVD
Creator to build a DVD from a project layout, as I demonstrate in Chapter 8 . . .
but it takes longer, and I’m a creature who craves instant satisfaction.
Project: Recording a DVD-R with iDVD
Do you have a DVD-R drive in your Macintosh? Yes? Then you’re a self-contained
movie studio, and you probably didn’t even know it! (Don’t worry — you have
plenty of time to hit eBay and bid on a beret, a megaphone, and one of those
chalkboards with the clacky thing on top.) On the software end, all you need is
iDVD 3. (And, as you’ve probably already figured out, this project gives you a
good idea of how to handle things under Windows XP with MyDVD 5.)
In this project, I use iDVD to show you how to create a home video DVD-
Video disc that you can watch in almost any standard DVD player. You may
be amazed at how easy Apple has made the process and how professional
your finished DVD looks. The completed disc features
 An interactive menu system
 Separate menus for digital video and a slideshow of still photographs
 Menu music imported from iTunes
 An automated slideshow
As a first step, you should convert or export your video in QuickTime format.
Both iMovie and Final Cut Pro allow you to export QuickTime movies directly,
but you can also use QuickTime Pro to convert video from other formats. If
you plan to add digital images, I recommend that they be in JPEG format,
which takes up far less room than the same images in TIFF format.
One cool feature of iDVD is its ability to use a digital photograph as the back-
ground for your DVD menu system. If you want to do this, make sure that the
image you’re using is 640x480 pixels. (If necessary, you can resize it with any
image editor; I use Photoshop.)
After your source material has been converted to QuickTime and JPEG,
follow these steps:
1. Double-click the iDVD icon in your Applications folder to launch the
program, which displays the iDVD project window that you see in
Figure 13-1.
233
Chapter 13: Storing Megastuff with DVD

In effect, the project window is the skeleton for your DVD menu, so it’s
time to put something on those bare bones.
2. Choose Project➪Project Info. Click in the Disc Name field and type the
name for your DVD. Click OK to save the change.
In this case, I entered Example. (Just call me Mr. Imagination.)
Next, it’s time to choose a theme, which includes preconfigured choices
for fonts, button styles, and the background image used in your menu.
3. Click the Customize button in the main iDVD window, which opens
the iDVD Theme drawer.
4. Click the Themes button at the top of the drawer and scroll through
the choices that appear, as shown in Figure 13-2, to choose a theme.
For this example, select the Green Linen 2 thumbnail in the list.
Figure 13-2:

Part IV: So, You’re Ready to Tackle Tougher Stuff? 

5. To use your own background image, click the Settings button in the
Theme drawer (see Figure 13-3), drag an image from a Finder window,
and drop it into the Image/Movie thumbnail (or well) in the Background
section.
To add a moving background, drag a QuickTime movie into the well
instead.
At this point, the blank menu system, shown in Figure 13-4, already looks
classier than anything I ever did with my VHS camcorder.
You can also indulge in additional iLife goodness: Click the Photos
button in the iDVD drawer and select an image directly from your iPhoto
collection.
6. Click the title text to change it, type the title for your menu, and press
Return to save it.

236
Part IV: So, You’re Ready to Tackle Tougher Stuff? 
The theme is, well, themes!
If you want to import your own image as a menu
background — or you want to create your own
theme and use it for all your future iDVD pro-
jects — click the Settings button at the top of
the iDVD drawer. As you can see in the follow-
ing figure, you have much to specify here,
including the background image, the position
and font properties of your title and buttons, and
the shape of your buttons. After you have
selected what you like from the Settings panel,
click the Save in Favorite button and specify a
name for your theme. After it has been saved,
you can pick your custom theme for any project.

7. Drag an audio clip into the Audio well in the Settings panel.
What fun is a menu without your favorite background tune? You can drag
the audio file from a Finder window, or click the Audio button in the iDVD
drawer to choose a song from your iTunes collection (if you’re feeling
sassy). iDVD recognizes AIFF, MP3, AAC, and WAV sound files.
Next, it’s time to add a video clip to the menu. That sounds a tad daunt-
ing, but there’s nothing to fear with iDVD.
8. Open the folder that contains your QuickTime movies and drag one to
the iDVD project window.
As you can see in Figure 13-6, the program creates a custom button using
a thumbnail image from the video. The button is automatically centered
in the screen for you. Definitely not daunting.
9. Because the title under the button is less than descriptive, change it:
Click once on the text to display the edit box and type a new name.
You can also move the slider that appears above the button to choose
the thumbnail image from within the clip. (This is great for clips that
begin with darkness or something equally as uninteresting.) Figure 13-7
illustrates the slider. If you enable the Movie check box, the Movie
button in the menu becomes animated!
You can move a Movie button anywhere you like on your menu — just
click it and drag it to the desired destination; it snaps to the closest posi-
tion on an imaginary grid. You can turn off this automatic alignment by
enabling the Free Position option in the Settings panel.
10. Add additional clips by repeating Steps 8 and 9.
You can add a maximum of six buttons to a single DVD menu screen;
personally, I avoid overcrowding a menu by adding no more than four
buttons.
Figure 13-6:
The first
video clip

the iDVD
project.
237
Chapter 13: Storing Megastuff with DVD

11. Add a separate submenu for your slideshow display of digital images:
Click the Folder button to add a submenu button to the project window
and change the button name to whatever you like (I typed Slide Show).
You can change the look of your menu buttons another way: Click the
Settings button in the Theme drawer, and then select any Movie button
you’ve added to your DVD menu layout. Adjust the button’s properties
in the Button section of the Settings panel, and voilà! You have a new
appearance for your buttons!
12. Double-click the Slideshow button on your iDVD menu to display the
submenu screen. Click the title at the top of the submenu screen to
open the edit box, type your title text, and press Return to save it.
13. It’s time to add the Slideshow button itself. Click the Slideshow
button at the bottom of the iDVD window, which adds a button to
your submenu.
14. Double-click the button that you added; this opens the My Slideshow
window. Drag the images that you want to add from their locations on
your hard drive into the window, as shown in Figure 13-8.
Once again, you can add images to your slideshow in another way: Click
the Photos button at the top of the iDVD drawer, which displays all the
images in your iPhoto Library (as well as the albums that you’ve defined
there). Images can be dragged from the Photos tab to the Slideshow
window.
15. At this point, you need to decide whether you want an automated
slideshow or a manual slideshow. If your parents had a slide projector
like mine did, this step should really interest you:
• Manual: For a manual slideshow, leave the Slide Duration drop-down
list box set to Manual. It’s a good idea to enable the Display < >
During Slideshow check box, which superimposes left and right
arrows on the image as appropriate. (Although these arrows are
optional, they help remind Aunt Harriet how to advance through the
Figure 13-7:
You can
select the

your button,

238
Part IV: So, You’re Ready to Tackle Tougher Stuff? 

photos in a manual slideshow.) The lucky person holding the DVD
player remote control presses the right cursor key to move forward
through the images and the left cursor key to move backward.
• Automatic: The DVD player displays the images automatically (but
you can still move forward and backward by using the remote).
Click the Slide Duration drop-down list box and select the number
of seconds to delay before switching to the next image. If you like,
you can still enable the Display < > During Slideshow check box.
16. How about some audio for that slideshow of your cousin’s wedding?
Again, you can drag an audio file from a Finder window to the Audio
well in the Slideshow window.
If you’re a fan of iTunes, click the Audio button in the iDVD drawer and
you can choose that perfect song from your iTunes playlists.
17. If you want to change the order of the slideshow sequence, click and
drag the image that you want to its new spot on the list. After you’ve
finished designing your slideshow, click the Return button to return
to the submenu screen.
Whoops — now that you have added your images, don’t forget to cus-
tomize the slideshow button.
18. Drag the slider to select one of the images in the slideshow as the
button image. To change the button’s caption, click it and type your
new text; press Return to save it.
(If you’re too cool for sliders, drag one of the JPEG images that will make
up your slideshow and drop it on top of the button.)
19. Care to preview your DVD? Click the Preview button at the bottom of
the iDVD window.
Figure 13-8:
Preparing
the contents
of the
slideshow.
239
Chapter 13: Storing Megastuff with DVD

iDVD displays a most cool-looking virtual remote. Note that the slideshow
button in the middle of the screen is now highlighted, just as it would
be if you were using your DVD player. Use the buttons on the remote 
to select menu items, and click Enter on the remote to activate the item
that’s highlighted. When you’re done playing with your DVD-to-be, click
the Preview button again to return to editing mode (where you can make
changes if you like).
You should save your project to your hard drive before you burn it.
20. Choose File➪Save Project As to display a standard Mac OS Save dialog
box. Navigate to the destination folder, type a new name for your pro-
ject, and click Save.
Okay, you film mogul, you — it’s time to record your own DVD!
21. Click the Burn button, which opens to display a glowing fail-safe
button. (Kinda nuclear-looking, ain’t it?)
Apple doesn’t want you to waste a blank disc with an accidental click 
of your mouse. (Plus, it’s one of the neatest animated controls I’ve ever
used.)
22. Click the Burn button again to start the recording process, and load a
blank DVD-R into your DVD recorder when prompted.
After the first disc has been burned, you can choose to record additional
copies.
23. When the recording is done, eject the disc and pop it in your DVD
player.
Or, if you like, you can watch your creation on your Mac with the Mac OS
X DVD Player, which you can find in the Applications folder.
I should warn you that iDVD has quite a bit of housekeeping to do to prepare
your digital video, so you probably have to wait several minutes before the
recording starts. (This preparation time depends on the speed of your Mac,
the number of movies that you have added, and how long they are.)

Adding That Spiffy Touch
In This Chapter
 Labeling with a marker
 Applying labels to your recorded discs
 Designing and creating jewel box inserts
 Designing and creating disc labels
Just how proud are you of your finished discs? I probably should narrow
the focus of that question a little: Just how proud are you of the appear-
ance of your finished discs?
If you’re happy with the sound of an audio CD and your computer can easily
read all the information that you recorded on a data disc, you’re technically
done. If you’re distributing your discs to others, though, or you want to include
background information on the contents of a CD, I highly recommend that
you take the extra step of printing a CD label or jewel case inserts. Heck, for
the most professional look, go hog-wild and print a matching set of labels and
their accompanying inserts!
In this chapter, I show you how to design and create with Label Creator, and
you add that spiffy visual touch that separates a ho-hum burning project
from a true masterpiece of art.
How Not to Label Your Discs
Before I get down to the business of adding a stylish, professional look to
your recorded discs, allow me to make absolutely, positively sure that you
don’t damage them! You can indeed simply write a title on top of the disc —
in fact, most blank discs these days are preprinted with straight lines to help
you write neatly — but if you would rather label your discs by hand, please
make sure that you avoid any of these writing instruments while marking
directly on your silver friends:

 Ballpoint or sharp-tipped pens: If your writing instrument has a sharp
point and it’s metallic, don’t even think about using it to mark your discs!
Standard ink is hard to see and simply wipes off most discs. That’s not
the real danger, though: You could scratch the surface of the disc and
damage it.
 Soluble markers: Although I advise you elsewhere in this book to keep liq-
uids away from your discs, soluble (also called erasable) markers are also
affected by the oil from your fingertips. In other words, if you happen to
brush your finger across the disc, Ella Fitzgerald may suddenly become la
rald. That’s not enough information to help me determine who’s singing —
although, in Ella’s case, I don’t really need a label! Stick with permanent
markers, and you get to keep all the words you write.
 Paint pens: Kids love these newfangled craft pens — your discs, on the
other hand, most definitely do not. The solvents in a typical paint pen
can damage the clear protective lacquer layer on top of the disc, and the
buildup produced by a paint pen can unbalance the disc if it’s heavily
used. Also, a disc with any type of buildup may be harder to use in your
car audio CD player. Can you imagine what loose flakes of paint could do
to that $400 CD deck you bought for your Porsche?
Some manufacturers of recordable DVDs advise that you shouldn’t apply
paper labels at all to their media. Check the instructions that accompanied
your blank media to see whether you should add a label to that new DVD-
Video disc you just burned!
Of course, I may sound overly cautious, but let me be blunt: I have more than
twelve hundred music discs in my collection (some of which are irreplaceable
live recordings), and I want each and every disc to last as long as possible!
The same goes for data CD-ROMs and DVD-ROMs; any digital camera owner
who enjoys the hobby probably would be just as protective of a photo collec-
tion archived to CD-ROM.
Hey, You Can Tell a Disc By Its Cover
If you’re like me, an audio CD isn’t really complete with a simple title and an
artist name scribbled on top. That works for a road mix with various artists,
perhaps, but I would still like to know the name of each track (as a minimum).
For my favorite music — and the rarer recordings in my collections — I like
to have much more on hand:
 The total time for each track in minutes and seconds — good for deter-
mining at a glance how long a particular period of musical nostalgia will
last. (For me, it’s the ’70s.)
 For live performances, I add the location and date of the gig and who
joined in the jam.
242
Part IV: So, You’re Ready to Tackle Tougher Stuff? 

 For composers, I include the year of their birth and death.
 For jazz groups, I like to keep track of who played what instrument.
Naturally, you can’t fit all that (or even a significant part of it) on the CD label.
Here’s where the extra space provided by jewel box inserts comes in so handy:
With the two sides of the front insert and a single-sided back insert, I have all
the territory I need to satisfy my historical urges.
Easy CD & DVD Creator doesn’t let you down! As part of the package, Roxio
provides a great object-oriented visual editor, Label Creator, that’s likely to
satisfy even the most demanding label and insert fanatic (even those of us
who can’t produce much more than a stick figure).
The program allows you to
 Add straight or curved text — with optional justification — using your
choice of fonts
 Include your own graphics and images
 Use basic shapes like squares and circles in your design
 Add cut and fold lines to help keep your geometry accurate
 Choose from a number of preset themes, which apply to all elements of
your label and cover set
Label Creator can use a huge variety of precut inserts, or you can print to
regular paper and use a cutting board to achieve the same results.
Progress marches on . . . if you’re using a DVD-R/W, DVD+R/W, or DVD-RAM
drive, check out the inserts that the program can create for standard plastic
DVD cases. The latest version of Label Creator can even produce labels for
those funky mini-discs!
“Hmmm, Can I Label with Duct Tape?”
Disc labels are big business these days: Just visit the software section of your
local Maze O’ Wires electronics store, and you’re likely to see at least three
or four different disc labeling packages. Some include only the label design,
printing software, and some blank labels to get you started; these labels are
applied by hand using a template guide, usually while the disc is held tightly
in its jewel case. Other packages include a device to help you precisely align
the label with the top of the disc.
I use the NEATO CD labeling system (www.neato.com), which includes the
two-piece NEATO label application device shown in Figure 14-1. To use the
device, you place your disc upside-down on the spindle (so that the recorded
243
Chapter 14: Adding That Spiffy Touch

side is facing up) and you put your printed paper label facedown on the base.
To apply the label, you simply push the spindle into the base and press
down. There’s no chance of misalignment, and the finished label is free from
bubbles.
After a label is applied to a disc, never attempt to remove it (unless the labels
that you’re using specifically say that you can do so). Virtually all labels are
designed to be permanent, and they don’t peel off!
I would say that disc labels come in a rainbow of colors, but that would 
be cliché — how about all the colors of the rainbow instead? You can 
even get clear labels that allow the color of the disc to show through 
from underneath — perfect for use with those neon-colored blank discs.
The NEATO system also comes with label design-and-printing software called
MediaFACE II (see Figure 14-2), which includes a set of features similar to
Label Creator.

Project: Creating Jewel Box Inserts
Ready to dive into Label Creator? In this project, I create a custom set of jewel
box inserts for a compendium of classic TV show theme songs that I’ve just
recorded from my MP3 collection. The inserts should list each track, the time
for each song, and the total time for the entire disc. The example uses clip art
of a TV set for the graphic.
Follow these steps:
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪Easy CD and DVD Creator 6➪Label
Creator to display the program’s main window, as shown in Figure 14-3.
Make sure that the Front icon is selected in the Cover display on the left
side of the screen.
You can also choose to launch Label Creator as soon as you have suc-
cessfully burned a disc. Starting the program this way automatically car-
ries the text information from the project layout into your label project.
Figure 14-3:
Where it all
begins —

245
Chapter 14: Adding That Spiffy Touch

If you like, you can use one of the Label Creator standard themes, which
provides a common background, entry fields, and a font for you to use.
Now it’s time to take a look at changing themes.
2. Choose Format➪Change Theme to open the Change Theme dialog box
that you see in Figure 14-4.
If you hate menus with a passion, you can click the Theme toolbar icon
instead, or simply double-click the desired theme thumbnail in the theme
strip at the bottom of the window. (Try saying that three times fast.)
Notice that Label Creator marks each theme as being either an audio
theme or a data theme. Although any theme can be used for any type of
disc, these tags indicate which types of fields automatically carry over
from a project layout. (Basically, if you choose to use an audio theme
with a data DVD-ROM, you have to do more work and create all the fields
manually.)
3. Select a jazzy retro audio theme to match those classic TV melodies:
Select 60’s [Audio] and watch as the program updates the Preview
window. You can continue to check out new themes, but after you’re
done, select 60’s [Audio] again and click OK to accept it.
If you start Label Creator immediately after recording a disc, all the text
information is already loaded into the fields. Because you started the
program from the Start menu, you need to import the information from
the disc.

4. Load your audio or data disc into your recorder.
I mention earlier in this book that enabling CD-Text is A Good Thing.
This is one of the reasons: Label Creator can use CD-Text to import text
into a label project at any point in the future.
5. In the Label Creator window, choose Add➪Disc Contents.
If you have more than one disc loaded on your system, the program asks
you which disc to use. Otherwise, it imports the disc information that
you entered when you burned the disc. As you can see in Figure 14-5,
this includes the title and artist name — the track list for an audio CD
appears on the Booklet and Back cover layouts. Remember, you can
switch back and forth between the different cover layouts in a project by
clicking the buttons at the left of the window.
6. If you want to make a change to any of the fields before you print (for
example, to correct a spelling error that you may have made when you
typed the text the first time), double-click directly in the field. An edit
text box appears, and you can type the information directly in the field.
Press Enter to save your changes.
If you make a mistake while you’re editing your layout, don’t forget that
old standby: The Undo button on the toolbar.

7. To add the clip art, choose Add➪Picture to display a standard File
Open dialog box. Navigate to the location of the clip art (which can be
in Windows bitmap or JPEG formats), click the filename to highlight
it, and click Open.
The graphic appears in its own resizable window.
8. To change the dimensions of the graphic, move your mouse cursor to
any of the square handles on the edge of the window and click and
drag to resize the edge. To move the entire graphic somewhere else
on the layout, click in the middle of the graphic window and drag it to
the spot you want.
Figure 14-6 illustrates the futuristic TV object, ready to be resized and
relocated.
9. To add a new block of text, choose Add➪Text or Curved Text.
A text block appears, ready for you to resize and relocate, as you did
with your graphics. 
10. To enter the text, double-click the text box to make it an edit text box,
and then type something; press Enter to save your changes.
11. If you’re using precut insert paper, load it into the printer as
instructed by the manufacturer.
When you’re ready to print (or you that you’re ready to print), use the
Print Preview function first — it can save you one or two sheets of
paper! 
12. Choose File➪Print Preview to display the screen shown in Figure 14-7.
If you’re satisfied, click Print on the toolbar; if you need to make
changes, click Close and return to the layout.

13. You can also print a back cover insert by clicking on the Back button
in the Cover display on the left side of the screen.
Because you have already either imported or typed your information,
the back cover layout automatically includes all that text. (Whew!)
Figure 14-8 illustrates the back cover layout for my TV Theme Songs

Project: Creating a CD Label
Now I need to create a CD label for a disc that is a collection of pop tunes for
a kid’s birthday party. Because I want to give the disc to the guest of honor
after the party, it needs to look its best! Follow these steps to create a CD or
DVD label:
250
Part IV: So, You’re Ready to Tackle Tougher Stuff? 
“Hey, where’s my text?”
If nothing shows up when you click the Contents
button, Label Creator cannot load any text from
the disc. Do you give up hope and throw your
hands up into the air helplessly? Not likely! You
can add that information in two ways:
 Siphon the Internet: If the disc is a copy 
of an existing audio CD, Label Creator 
automatically does the Internet thing and
tries to download the information from a CD
database. If this doesn’t work, make sure
that the Enable Audio Disc Information
Download check box is enabled: Choose
Edit➪Preferences and click the Internet tab
to display the field, as shown in the following
figure. Enable the check box (if it’s not
already enabled) and click OK.
 Start typing: If Label Creator reports that
your disc can’t be found in the Internet CD
database, you have to manually enter any
information that you want printed on the
inserts. Choose Add➪Track to open the Add
New Track dialog box (see the following
figure), and enter just the information you
want; it can include the track number, title,
and the duration. Click Add Track to save the
information to the label layout. Repeat this
procedure for each track; after you have fin-
ished, click Done. Finally, double-click the
words Artist or Title within the main screen
to enter the artist name and the disc title.
Label Creator opens an edit text box, and
you can type the information directly in the
field. Press Enter to save your changes.

1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪Easy CD and DVD Creator 6➪Label
Creator to run Label Creator. In the Cover display on the left side o
f the screen, click the Disc icon, which opens the layout shown in
Figure 14-9.
2. Import the disc information by choosing Add➪Disc Contents.
For a standard label, this step fills in the track names, the title, and the
artist name.
You could click the Theme toolbar button and select one of the Roxio
themes, but in this case you want to use a background of your own.
3. Choose Format➪Change Background to display the Change
Background dialog box, shown in Figure 14-10.
4. Enable the Disc Label check box and click the Select a Picture button
to display the File Open dialog box.
To add an image acquired directly from your digital camera or scanner,
click the Acquire a Picture button instead.
5. Locate your JPEG or Windows bitmap image file. Select the filename
and click Open. You see that the background is loaded on the disc
label template. Click OK to return to the Label Creator main screen.

Chapter 14: Adding That Spiffy Touch

6. Click the Font drop-down list box in the toolbar and select a festive
font. (Note the example of the font that appears to the right of each
name in the list.) To increase or decrease the font size, select a
number from the Points drop-down list box.
Remember that the changes you make to the text format and font affect
only the text box that’s selected (in this case, the Title text box).
7. Select the Artist text box and choose the same font and point size.
8. Add a Happy Birthday message and the date to the disc. Choose
Add➪Text, which adds a new text block to the layout. Resize and 
relocate the new text block below the spindle hole.
9. Double-click the text box to make it an edit text box, type the text, 
and then press Enter to save your changes.
The completed label is illustrated in Figure 14-11.

10. Load your CD label blanks into your printer as instructed by the 
manufacturer.

you’re satisfied, click Print on the toolbar; if you need to make
changes, click Close and return to the layout.

In this part . . .
S
tep right up, step right up! Gentlefolk, I offer you 
valuable tips, guidelines, and advice on CD and DVD
recording. You, too, can be a sharp troubleshooter, but be
wary of pitfalls along the way. I also point out ten sweet
little programs that may become invaluable as a part of
your personal CD recording studio.

Ten Hardware Troubleshooting
Tips
In This Chapter
 Checking jumpers
 Turning everything on — correctly
 Fixing audio CDs that click
 Adding an audio data cable
 Fixing driver problems
 Updating your recorder’s firmware
 Using your system’s fastest drive
 Removing a DVD-RAM from its cartridge
 Cleaning your drive
 Ejecting a stuck disc
N
othing is worse than a minor hardware problem — except, of course,
a major hardware problem. In this Part of Tens chapter, I cover my
favorite tips to help you leap over the most common physical troubles with
CD and DVD recording: that is, those difficulties that result from your hard-
ware settings, your blank media, and — most important — your drive. Some
of these items are mentioned earlier in this book, but they’re important
enough (and crop up enough) that they should be repeated.
“Why, Of Course the Jumper 
Is Set Correctly!”
Tip: Check and double-check your jumper and DIP switch settings before
you replace the cover on your computer.

Let me be honest: Configuring both jumpers and DIP switches is a pain, and
both EIDE and SCSI recorder owners are stuck with them. Every drive manu-
facturer seems to use different settings, and if you’re installing an older drive
(or one you scavenged from a friend or relative), you may find yourself with-
out documentation on which jumpers need to be moved where. (It’s best to
ignore the USB and FireWire folks snickering in the background — they have
no jumpers to set.)
Unfortunately, those settings mean the difference between your drive work-
ing and not working; unlike with horseshoes, you don’t get points when you
come close with your jumper settings. Therefore:
 When you’re installing an EIDE drive, check any other device on the
cable (even if the other device shouldn’t have to change its master and
slave settings).
 Check your drive’s documentation to make sure that the drive is oriented
properly so that its pins match the pins in the manual. (After all, a group
of eight pins looks the same when viewed upside down.) Most jumper pin
sets are marked with identifying numbers on the circuit board to help
you determine which pin is Pin 1. DIP switches are easier to “read” than
jumper pins because each switch is clearly marked.
 Never use a pencil when setting DIP switches, because the lead from the
pencil can result in a shorted switch.
 Save any jumpers that you can completely remove; it’s amazing just how
precious that little chunk of plastic and metal can be. Stick any spares in
your parts bin and cherish them.
 If you don’t have any documentation for an EIDE or SCSI device and you
don’t know the settings, visit the manufacturer’s Web site and look for
manuals in text or Adobe Acrobat PDF format.
How You Turn Things On 
Does Make a Difference
Tip: Turn external drives on before you boot your computer.
Most computer owners figure that they can turn on their computers and exter-
nal toys in any order, but that approach can cause problems — especially with
external SCSI drives, which are particularly sensitive to these matters. As a
rule, turn on all external peripherals first, like your printer, scanner, and CD
or DVD recorder.
258
Part V: The Part of Tens 

You can easily take care of this problem once and for all: Buy a surge sup-
pressor or UPS (uninterruptible power supply) for your system and plug
your computer and all your peripherals into it. Just leave everything plugged
in and switched on. Then use the switch on the surge suppressor or UPS to
turn everything on at one time. (Think of it as that big master switch that 
Dr. Frankenstein always pulled to start everything in the laboratory.) Because
your external stuff comes on instantly (before your computer even gets
started booting up), this method is the same as turning on everything exter-
nal by hand.
(This little trick is one of those that separates the novices from the power
users, so consider yourself initiated.)
Where Did That Click Come From?
Tip: Always use Disc-at-Once recording when you’re burning audio CDs.
Although this question indicates a hardware problem, it’s not a problem you
can solve with a setting change on your computer. If you’re hearing irritating
clicks between tracks when you play an audio CD, the hardware in question
is your audio CD player. This happens with many older players when you burn
audio CDs using the Track-at-Once recording method; the click is caused by
the gap your recorder leaves between tracks, which your audio CD player
detects. To make things even more frustrating, that same CD plays perfectly
in other audio CD players and CD-ROM drives.
To avoid the problem altogether, always use the Disc-at-Once recording
method when you’re burning audio CDs. Fortunately, all but the most antique
CD recorders (those older than five years or so) are able to record with Disc-
at-Once. Because these older drives are as slow as molasses in an Alaskan
winter, I strongly recommend that you spend $150 or so and buy a new drive.
Not only do you get Disc-at-Once, but you can also see the progress bar moving
when you record a disc. (Ever recorded at 2X? I started out with a 2X recorder
in the halcyon days of the early 90’s . . . that, good neighbors, is the definition
of the word plodding.)
Your Recorder Wants to Play, Too
Tip: Don’t forget to connect the audio cable from your sound card to your
new drive.
259
Chapter 15: Ten Hardware Troubleshooting Tips

Here’s another common problem that I hear all the time: “My recorder works
great when I’m burning discs, but if I try to play an audio CD with my CD or
DVD recorder, I get nothing.”
If you can hear the audio with headphones connected to your drive’s head-
phone jack, you have pinpointed this problem: You forgot to connect the digi-
tal audio output cable from your drive to your sound card. Without this cable,
the drive can play an audio CD and you’ll never hear it. You probably received
the cable with your sound card — sometimes, drive manufacturers include
one, too. If you have already connected a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive to your
sound card, use that drive rather than your recorder to listen to audio CDs.
Most sound cards have only one of these input connectors.
Driving Miss Data
Tip: Keep up-to-date any hardware drivers required by your drive.
For folks using internal EIDE and SCSI drives, this isn’t much of an issue — an
internal drive uses the standard hardware drivers that come with Windows
or Mac OS. However, external USB and FireWire drives are a different matter
entirely. These recorders often use drivers supplied by the manufacturer, and
it’s possible for other hardware installations to overwrite them accidentally,
causing your drive to take a dive.
At least, I think it’s by accident — sometimes, a typical PC system reminds me
of a gladiator’s arena. Various pieces of hardware and software battle it out
with sword and shield to see who works and who fails. (And then, of course,
Microsoft releases a new version of Windows, the arena master lets loose the
lions, and everything fails.)
Your drive’s manufacturer may also release new versions of that hardware
driver; these updates can solve problems or improve compatibility with your
operating system.
Check your drive’s manual for the company’s Web site and download the
latest drivers directly to your computer; if you’re not on the Internet at this
time, call the company’s tech support line and request that someone send
you the drivers on a disk.
Keep Your Firmware on the Cutting Edge
Tip: Flash your recorder with the latest firmware.
260
Part V: The Part of Tens 

That advice may sound somewhat racy, but in this case, the term flash means
the updating of your drive’s internal firmware. Your recorder’s firmware
stores all the programming for its various functions — much like the BIOS
(Basic Input/Output System) stores settings and configurations for a PC. It’s
called firmware because it can be updated, just like the hardware drivers that
I cover in the preceding section. In fact, you update your drive’s firmware for
many of the same reasons that you update hardware drivers: to fix bugs in
your drive’s operation, improve the performance of the drive, and even add
or enhance a feature or two.
Again, the manufacturer’s Web site generally offers firmware upgrades, but if
you’re without Web access and you’re lucky enough to talk to technical sup-
port, you can request that an upgrade be sent to you in the mail.
Speed Does Make a Difference
Tip: Use the fastest drive on your system to store images and temporary files.
With all the sky-high X factors wandering around the countryside — 8X DVD
recording, and 40X CD recording — it’s easy to forget that your hard drive’s
performance also has a direct impact on the success of your CD and DVD
burning. (I mention defragmenting, a way to improve your hard drive’s per-
formance, in Chapter 6.)
If you have more than one hard drive on your system, check your recording
software and see whether it has a system test that you can run to determine
which drive is the fastest. (Easy CD & DVD Creator has this feature: To run
the system tests, run Creator Classic and choose Tools➪System Tests.) You
can also download hard drive speed-testing programs from Internet share-
ware sites.
After you have determined which drive is the fastest, configure your record-
ing software to use that drive for its temporary storage area. Also, choose
that drive when you’re saving a disc image or when you’re collecting files in
one place before you add them to your CD or DVD layout.
Leave This Cartridge, DVD-RAM,
and Seek Your Fortune
Tip: To use a DVD-RAM in a DVD player, jettison the cartridge.
261
Chapter 15: Ten Hardware Troubleshooting Tips

I’m a fan of DVD-RAM — I like to use my drive for backups and DV storage.
Once in awhile, however, I burn a disc for use in my DVD player. (It’s a third-
generation player, so it can read DVD-RAMs.) Most people who try this tech-
nique quickly find out that their DVD players can’t accept the huge, clunky
cartridge that surrounds a DVD-RAM, so they figure that this can’t be done.
If you use a DVD-RAM cartridge, you can easily remove the disc from the case
for use in tray drives; in fact, the entire front side of the cartridge (by the
write-protect switch) is hinged so that it can open. Find the tiny round lock-
ing pin at the bottom left of the cartridge; use a pen to punch out the pin and
discard it. Locate the release tab on the left front corner of the cartridge, push
in the tab with a paper clip, and you can pull the front side of the cartridge
toward you.
Keep in mind that the surface of any recordable DVD media (that includes
DVD-R/W, DVD+R/W, and DVD-RAM) is much — and brothers and sisters, I do
mean much — more sensitive to fingerprints and dust than a CD-R or CD-RW.
Take the utmost precaution in handling a recordable DVD, and follow this
Mark’s Maxim to the letter:
Never set a recordable DVD on a surface (not even label side down);
leave it outside its jewel box or your drive only long enough to trans-
port it back and forth.™
Take That Cleaning Disc Far, Far Away
Tip: Never, never, never use a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM cleaning disc in your
recorder.
They certainly look innocent and harmless, hanging on the shelf at your local
discount store. But don’t be tempted to try a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM cleaning
disc in your CD or DVD recorder. These discs typically use a tiny brush on
the underside of the disc, which is supposed to sweep dust and dirt from
your drive’s lens. Unfortunately, they can damage your recorder’s read/write
lens system (which, by the way, is self cleaning anyway). Those tiny bristles
can be pulled loose and stick in your drive, or the brush can scratch the sur-
face of the laser lens.
The best way to keep your recorder clean is to keep the tray closed. Don’t
leave it open unless you’re loading or unloading a disc. If you have an exter-
nal recorder, wipe it from time to time with a dry, static-free cloth to remove
surface dust.
262
Part V: The Part of Tens 

When Your Disc Cries, “I’m Stuck!”
Tip: Use the emergency eject hole to unload a troublesome disc.
Typically, you use the emergency eject hole on the front of your drive if
 The disc isn’t turning in the drive for some reason (perhaps it was loaded
off-center in the tray).
 Your computer’s operating system has locked up and you can’t eject
the tray.
 You have a hardware driver problem and the tray doesn’t eject.
To manually eject the tray, carefully insert a straightened paperclip into the
emergency eject hole on the front of your drive and push it gently. This tech-
nique may take a few tries because the release button you’re trying to press
is pretty small. (If this seems a little silly, feel free to hum the theme from
Mission Impossible.)

“I
t’s only software — you can fix it easily, right?” I wish that I had a dime
for every time I’ve heard that question. For some reason, most com-
puter owners seem to feel that a software glitch is automatically easier to
solve than a hardware problem. This, dear friends, is about as accurate as
Napoleon’s assessment of Waterloo. In fact, software incompatibilities can be
even harder to track down and solve than hardware problems. Both Windows
and Mac OS use dozens of drivers and programs (tactlessly spread out over
the entire hard drive in locations dark and mysterious) to control the opera-
tion of a single CD recorder. They all have to work together as a team, but
sometimes some of these files seem to strike out on their own just to gener-
ate headaches for you.
I use this Part of Tens chapter to address the software tips I dispense most
often to my family, friends, and consulting customers. Only the latter have to
pay anything, but I eat well during the holidays. I cover three or four of these
tips in earlier chapters, but they belong in the Top Ten Tips category, so you
also find them here.

Device Manager: Checking 
under the Windows Hood
Tip: Use the Windows Device Manager to check for possible software
conflicts.
Most Windows owners have used the Device Manager (see Figure 16-1) from
time to time to take care of a specific task — for instance, enabling or dis-
abling auto insert notification, which I cover in the section, “In Case of a Disc
Loading, Please Notify Windows Immediately,” later in this chapter. You may
not realize, however, that the Device Manager also makes a doggone good
basic software diagnostic tool. With it, you can check
 Whether hardware devices and their software drivers are working
correctly
 Whether two hardware devices are “fighting” over the same system
resources (which can cause both devices to stop working or your PC to
lock up)
 Whether you have hardware devices that Windows doesn’t recognize
Figure 16-1:
The
awesome
glory of the
Windows
Device
Manager.
266
Part V: The Part of Tens 

You can also use Device Manager to change the settings, configuration, and
properties for each piece of hardware on your system. To display the Device
Manager in Windows 2000 and Windows XP, right-click the My Computer icon
on your Windows desktop and choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
Click the Hardware tab, and then click the Device Manager button. If a device
is causing problems, Windows marks it with either a yellow question mark
symbol or a red check symbol. You can display the properties for any hard-
ware device by clicking it to highlight it and choosing Properties.
If another device is attempting to use the same system resources as your
internal recorder, display the properties for the offending device and enable
the Disable in this Hardware Profile check box at the bottom of the panel.
This setting should allow your drive to work (at least you can record while
you try to figure out what’s wrong). I also recommend trying to remove the
conflicting device from your system and allowing Windows to reinstall it. To
do this, right-click the device in the Device Manager, click Remove, and
reboot your PC.
If you have a copy of Norton Utilities 2004 or Norton SystemWorks 2004, I
also heartily recommend the dynamic duo of Norton WinDoctor (shown in
Figure 16-2) and Norton Disk Doctor — they’re a great combination! Disk
Doctor can check your drive for file and folder problems (caused by a power
failure, for example), and WinDoctor automates repairs for common software
problems that crop up over time (like when a program doesn’t completely
uninstall).

Chapter 16: Ten Software Troubleshooting Tips

Your Image Can Be Everything
Tip: If your older PC and CD or DVD recorder are experiencing Buffer
Underrun errors, record from a disc image.
If you’re using an older Pentium II or III computer and a recorder without sup-
port for burnproof recording, you likely still encounter the dreaded Buffer
Underrun error. (You may remember from earlier chapters that a Buffer
Underrun error indicates that your PC can’t transfer data fast enough from
your hard drive to your recorder. The recorder aborts the burn.) Although
defragmenting helps, it doesn’t solve the problem completely; the more files
you record and the smaller they are, the more your computer and hard drive
have to work to supply your recorder with the 1s and 0s (zeros) it craves.
Buffer Underruns don’t happen on every disc, but when they do, they cause a
trip to Coaster City.
What can you do (other than buy a new and faster PC or a recorder that
offers burnproof recording)? Here’s a tip that can keep you going while you
save up the cash for a new system: Use Easy CD & DVD Creator to record the
project as a disc image first, and then record the actual disc from the image.
Your computer has an easier time sending a single large file to your recorder
than it does sending hundreds or thousands of smaller files, and you’re much
less likely to encounter recording errors.
For details on creating a disc image, turn to Chapter 8.
“Hey, Your Session’s Open!”
Tip: Don’t forget to close a session before you’re finished with a disc.
You have no need to be embarrassed about this one. If you wrote a session to
a disc and left it open (either because you forgot to close it or you wanted 
to burn more to the disc later), you can still read the disc in your recorder.
However, both your computer’s read-only CD-ROM drive and a standard
audio CD player will likely spit it back at you. To read the disc, you have to
use your recorder.
To close an open session using Easy CD & DVD Creator, load the disc into
your recorder, click Disc, and choose the Disc Information menu item. From
the Disc Information dialog box (illustrated beautifully in Figure 16-3), click
the drive to display the information for the disc, and then click Finalize
Session.
268
Part V: The Part of Tens 

“Captain’s Log, Stardate, Uh —
Hey, Spock, What Day Is It?”
Tip: Use the recording log to help diagnose recurring problems.
The way I see it, the more information you have — and, in the worst case, the
more information your technical support representative has — the easier it is
to diagnose what’s going wrong with your system. Easy CD & DVD Creator can
log all error messages to a file in any folder you choose, so you don’t have to
hover around the monitor with a scratch pad and a pencil to scribble down
anything you see.
To enable error logging, click Tools and click the Options menu item to dis-
play the Creator Classic Options dialog box, as shown in Figure 16-4. Select
the Enable Error Logging check box, and click the Browse button to select the
folder where the log will be written. Choose a directory other than the Windows
Temp directory (you don’t want to lose the log because of a Disk Cleanup
operation), enter a filename, like ERROR.LOG, and click Open. Finally, click
OK to save your changes and return to Easy CD & DVD Creator.
To open the log, you can use Windows Notepad or any text editor — even
Microsoft Word will do, in a pinch.

Chapter 16: Ten Software Troubleshooting Tips

Don’t Use Dated Software
Tip: Always apply the latest updates and patches to your recording software.
As hardware continues to advance, so must your software! Updates to your
recording program can fix bugs, add support for new recorders, enhance the
performance of the program, and improve the program’s compatibility with
your operating system.
However, many folks ask me “Do I need to upgrade to the latest version of the
software?” Naturally, that costs you cash and, not surprisingly, I recommend
that you not upgrade unless
 You specifically need a new feature that has been added to the new 
version.
 The new version performs significantly better on your current system.
 The current version doesn’t support your brand-new recorder, and your
current version will have no future updates. (Some companies have the
nasty habit of dropping all support for older versions after one or two
newer versions have been released.)
Check the software developer’s Web site for updates and patches. Also, many
programs now have built-in links to the company’s Web site, so your record-
ing software can launch your browser for you and automatically connect to
the proper Web page. Woo-hoo!

Validation Is a Good Thing
Tip: If you’re recording an ISO 9660 disc or over the network, validate
before you burn.
As you may know, recording an ISO 9660 disc (which doesn’t accept long file-
names and folder names and strictly limits the number of folders you can add
to a disc) on a Windows PC usually requires you to rename and move things
within your CD layout. An ISO 9660 disc doesn’t accept long names for files and
folders. Unfortunately, the problems you encounter trying to record a disc are
almost never apparent until you’re ready to burn — or after you try to read the
disc you’ve just burned (using your PC) on another computer that’s running
the Linux operating system. Although programs such as Easy CD & DVD
Creator warn you about these problems, I’ve used recording software that
didn’t give me any warning whatsoever and merrily burned a useless disc.
Another common problem occurs while you’re recording files over a network
from a remote hard drive. If the drive is suddenly taken off the network or the
remote user renames a file or folder before you start the recording, the process
rewards you with a fat, juicy error and a lovely coaster as a parting gift.
Obviously, what you need in situations like these is a way to verify that
 The files and folders arranged in your layout all conform to the require-
ments of the file system you have chosen
 The files and folders that reside on a remote network drive are still avail-
able and still bear the same names
Lo and behold, Creator Classic delivers with its validation feature, which you
can use with any layout type that includes data files. After you’re ready to
record and you want to verify that everything is Go for launch, choose File➪
Validate Project. You can watch the fun as the program checks each item in
your CD layout; if anything fishy turns up, Creator Classic alerts you with a
warning dialog and you can fix it immediately.
In Case of a Disc Loading, Please
Notify Windows Immediately
Tip: Know when to enable or disable auto insert notification.
Windows offers a host of small niceties that make your computing life much
easier — not the least of which is the ability to automatically run a selected
program from a CD as soon as it’s loaded. This feature is AutoPlay, and many
PC owners don’t know that they can disable it if they want.
271
Chapter 16: Ten Software Troubleshooting Tips

Why would you want to disable AutoPlay? When you’re copying tracks or
entire discs during a burning session and you load a source CD-ROM, the last
thing you want is an installation program automatically starting up! For this
reason, many recording programs disable AutoPlay automatically. But talk
about a Catch-22: If your recording software disables AutoPlay, you have to
install new CD-ROM software by double-clicking the right program. (Sometimes
figuring out precisely what you’re supposed to run from a game’s CD-ROM is
a little challenging.) Plus, when you load an audio CD, you have to run your
audio CD player program manually.
Therefore, here’s how you can disable auto insert notification within
Windows XP, as necessary:
1. Double-click the My Computer icon on your desktop.
2. Right-click once on the drive you need to configure to highlight it and
choose Properties.
3. Click the AutoPlay tab to display the panel shown in Figure 16-5.
4. Click the Content drop-down list box to choose the desired type of
disc.
5. Enable the Select an Action to Perform radio button, and click the
Take No Action icon to disable AutoPlay for the selected disc type.
6. Click OK to exit the Properties panel and return to the Windows 
desktop.
If you’d like to avoid this hassle, you can click the Prompt Me Each Time to
Choose an Action button on the AutoPlay tab — this means that Windows XP

272
Part V: The Part of Tens 

will display a confirmation dialog each time you load a disc. (Okay, so this is
a bit of a hassle as well, but many people prefer this route instead of disabling
AutoPlay entirely.)
Depending on the driver your recorder uses, you may have to reboot immedi-
ately after this process.
Slow It Down, Speed Racer
Tip: Use a slower recording speed when you encounter errors.
This advice is one of those basic truths that should be made into a tattoo. If
you’re encountering recording errors when your new 8X DVD recorder is
burning across the landscape at its top velocity, slow down! No unwritten law
says that you have to record every disc at the maximum speed offered by
your drive.
For a number of reasons, your system may not be able to supply data at the
top speed supported by your drive — even with burnproof support, your drive
may slow to a crawl under certain circumstances. (You won’t ruin the disc,
though.) You may be multitasking with a woolly mammoth like Photoshop,
or you may be recording a slew of tiny 4K files that are thrashing your hard
drive. (Consider writing a disc image first, as I explain in the section, “Your
Image Can Be Everything,” earlier in this chapter.) Also, don’t forget that most
manufacturers rate their blank media with a top speed; if you’re trying to write
at 8X with discs rated at only 2X, bad things may happen. Your mileage may
vary according to your brand of drive and discs, and whether you’re using
CD or DVD media.
When All Else Fails, Reinstall!
Tip: In case of massive, horrendous software problems, uninstall and 
reinstall!
Yes, I know — you and I have heard that litany countless times, but it’s true. It
really works. If your recording software is continually locking up or crashing,
uninstall the program: Click Start and choose Settings➪Control Panel➪Add/
Remove Programs. After you wipe the program from your system, reinstall it.
Don’t forget to reapply any patches or updates (that is, unless all your trou-
bles started immediately after you applied an update).
Why does this technique work? It’s a blanket approach to the problem: 
When you reinstall, you erase and replace whatever’s causing (or at least 
273
Chapter 16: Ten Software Troubleshooting Tips

contributing) to the errors. Potential culprits can include missing or corrupted
drivers and shared files, “mulched” configuration files, and even updates to
your software that have caused things to go haywire.
No, reinstalling doesn’t always work, but it is something you should always try.
Overdoing Overburning
Tip: Overburn only when you really need the extra space.
As I mention in Chapter 2 of this book, overburning can squeeze from your
blank discs additional megabytes of space (or a minute or two extra for
audio CDs) — if your CD recorder can reliably overburn. That’s a big if
because both your recording software and your drive have to support this
procedure. However, even if you can overburn, keep these tips in mind:
 Overburned discs are generally unreadable in CD-ROM drives 4 years
old or older, and in many audio CD players.
 Switching media brands can suddenly thwart your attempts at 
overburning — it depends on the manufacturer.
 Check with the manufacturer of your drive to determine the absolute
limit in megabytes and minutes and seconds you can overburn. (If nec-
essary, a bit of experimentation can tell you this limit.)
With most media, I recommend that you keep almost all your recordings below
the 80-minute/700MB limit and overburn only when it’s absolutely necessary.

Ten Things to Avoid 
Like the Plague
In This Chapter

 Avoiding just about every type of liquid
 Steering clear of improper labels
 Shunning copyrighted copying
 Giving the boot to tiny data buffers

M
other Nature has ways of telling you to stay away from certain plants
and animals — you don’t want to get involved, usually because of claws,
teeth, or poisonous spines. Alternating bands of neon green and orange can’t
be A Good Thing, right?
Unfortunately, you can encounter lots of really nasty, time-wasting trouble
when buying, installing, and using a CD or DVD recorder, and you don’t
receive any warning beforehand. For example, recording over a network
sounds like a great idea — until you try it.
In this Part of Tens chapter, I take over as the technoversion of Mother Nature
(now there’s a weird visual image for you) and identify what should be off-limits.
Avoid these things like the plague, and you’ll thank me!

Antique USB 1.1 Drives
Two or three years ago, shopping for an external drive came down to two
choices. You could pick Small Computer System Interface (or SCSI, which was
expensive, complex to configure, and quite scary for the average PC owner)
or take the easy route and choose a USB 1.1 drive. Many folks opted for
Universal Serial Bus (USB) because a USB drive is easy to install and much
cheaper than a SCSI adapter card and drive.
In the new millennium, however, a USB 1.1 drive doesn’t appear quite so
attractive, and you should avoid buying one. Here’s what the advertisements
for these drives didn’t tell you:
 They’re slow. Compared with USB 2.0 or FireWire, I mean really slow: If
Dorothy had used a USB 1.1 drive, she would still be in the Land of Oz.
Because the data transfer rate is limited to the top speed of a parallel
port, virtually all USB 1.1 drives are limited to 4X recording, with a hand-
ful of drives capable of a blistering 8X.
 Forget DVD burning. You might as well try to burn a DVD-R with a book
of matches — a horrible pun, but you get the idea. USB 1.1 simply can’t
provide the data transfer speeds to burn a DVD at 2X or higher.
Unless you have absolutely no recourse — either you burn with a USB 1.1
drive or you don’t burn discs — let these antiques fade away into the hoary
pages of history and invest in a USB 2.0 or FireWire recorder.
“Holy Aqueous Tragedy, Batman!”
(Avoiding Liquids)
Not much explanation needed for this Mark’s Maxim:
Keep liquids away from both your discs and your recorder!™
In a pitched battle, a diet soda always wins. At least you can clean your discs
when they have been accidentally dunked — you may have to use a little disc
cleaning solution. However, knock your mug of hot cocoa on your external
recorder, and you have just created an expensive paperweight.
276
Part V: The Part of Tens 

A Bad Labeling Job Is 
Worse than No Label
To accurately read a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM, your drive has to control the speed
of the disc’s rotation, and — oh, there I go with the engineering-speak again.
(Insert sound of my palm slapping my forehead.) All you have to remember is
that a disc that’s badly out of balance is harder to read, so sticking a huge,
heavy label on just one side of a disc may render it unusable. This includes
large mailing labels, return address labels, and even — gasp — stickers. If a
label weighs enough, it throws the disc’s balance out of whack. For this reason,
many manufacturers of DVD media advise that you never apply a paper label
to their discs; check the manufacturer’s recommendations before you stick
something where it shouldn’t go!
The easiest way to avoid this problem is to use CD-ROM/DVD-ROM labels 
and a labeling device, like a CD Stomper (www.cdstomper.com) or NEATO
(www.neato.com) system, which leave your discs in perfect balance after
they’re applied. Even better, you get quite a bit more space to hang text and
graphics.
One note of warning about any label you apply: After it’s on your disc, don’t
try to remove it unless it’s specifically designed to come off! Most labels use a
permanent adhesive; if you try to peel it off, you will probably rip the label
(which can unbalance the disc).
Copy Protection Works
If you’re buying a CD or DVD recorder to create backup copies of games or
DVD movies, don’t expect much success. Most computer CD-ROM games and
all DVD-ROM discs are copy protected, and you won’t have any luck in dupli-
cating them. (They’re also copyrighted, but I don’t go into that here.)
Certain programs can remove the encryption from DVD movies, and one or
two recording programs purport to duplicate discs. However, a number of
different copy-protection schemes are also available and are continually
being updated. Therefore, what works on one disc may not work on the
next. ’Nuff said.
277
Chapter 17: Ten Things to Avoid Like the Plague

Don’t Settle for a Tiny Buffer
As I mention earlier in this book, the size of your recorder’s data buffer has a
direct effect on the performance of your recorder — especially when your
system is under pressure, like when other programs are running in the back-
ground or you’re recording at 24X or faster speeds. The larger the buffer, the
more efficient the recording process, and the less likely you are to encounter
errors during the burn. (If the drive supports burnproof recording, buffer size
is somewhat less critical, but you’ll still benefit from faster recording with a
larger buffer.)
If you’re shopping for a recorder, I recommend a drive with at least 2MB; nat-
urally, 4MB or more would be even better. Most older recorders have a scanty
buffer of 512K (or even less), so scavengers beware.
“We Interrupt This Network 
Recording. . . .”
Let me be straightforward and say that this section is a personal vendetta. I
was a hardware technician for a large hospital for several years in my home-
town of Columbia, Missouri, and one of the other techs I worked with was
continually ruining perfectly good discs trying to record over a network. He
was using files from a network hard drive as the source, and because of the
constant network broadcast messages and servers going up and down, he
produced coaster after coaster. Eventually, I recommended that he try packet
writing with Roxio’s Drag-to-Disc (the subject of Chapter 10), which solved
most of the problems. A burnproof recorder can also help alleviate problems
with an overloaded network, but it still won’t remount a network drive that’s
disappeared because the server went down!
Of course, you may find yourself forced to record over the network if your
recorder is installed in a diskless workstation or an older computer with a
tiny drive, but if you have the hard drive space on the computer with the
recorder, please copy those files to the computer’s local hard drive and
record them from there.
I can’t bear to think of any more innocent silver lives being wasted because
the network slowed to a crawl.
278
Part V: The Part of Tens 

How Slow Is Too Slow?
This one’s for all the scavengers out there: If you have inherited a 2X or 4X CD
recorder, consider passing it on to another friend or family member and shop-
ping for a new drive. “Why, that’s heresy to a scavenger, Mark! Of all the folks
on this planet, you should know that!” It’s true, I have scavenged more than
my share of unwanted 4MB video cards, keyboards, ISA network cards, and
SIMM memory from garage sales and basements. However, you have three
good reasons to turn your back on 4X (and perhaps even 8X) CD recorders:
 How much is your time worth? After you have recorded an entire 680MB
disc in 3 minutes with a 24X drive, you’re going to wonder whether your
2X or 4X drive is lying dormant in hibernation for 15 minutes (or more)
while it’s burning a disc.
 Older drives don’t have the niceties. With an “antique” 2X or 4X drive,
you are likely to miss out on most of the features I have been crowing
about — packet writing, Disc-at-Once, burnproof recording, and even CD
Extra discs.
 Their support has dried up. Good luck in getting support for a 5- or 6-
year-old drive: If you’re lucky, the manufacturer may still have a firmware
update or two on their Web sites, but it’s more likely that support for
such an old model has evaporated completely.
Of course, that 4X drive can still burn a mighty nice data CD-ROM of the plain
variety. Just have your lunch on hand while you wait.
In the DVD recording world, recording speeds are rated much slower, but vir-
tually all drives out there can burn at 2X — if you can afford it, you’ll save
yourself a heap of time if you opt for a 4X or super-fast 8X DVD burner.
Give Those Discs a Home!
If you have been burning discs for six months or so, you have followed one of
two paths:
 The light path: You have picked up a snazzy CD/DVD binder or a jewel
box shelf unit, and your discs are resting comfortably in their protected,
dust-free environment. Your audio CDs don’t skip because of scratches,
and your data CD-ROMs and DVD movies never give you a hint of trouble
when you read them.
279
Chapter 17: Ten Things to Avoid Like the Plague

 The dark path: You have two or three stacks of 20 unprotected discs
adorning the front of your monitor, and they’re picking up scratches and
dust right before your eyes. (Also, you knock over a stack from time to
time and wake up your significant other with a scream.)
Do yourself — and your discs — a favor and store them the right way.
Putting the Worthless in 
High-Tech Cleaning
I mention this in Chapter 1, but it bears repeating: You have absolutely no
reason to spend $20 or more on a CD cleaning device that looks like a cross
between one of da Vinci’s flying machines and an automatic bread maker. All
you need to clean your shiny round friends is a photographer’s lens cloth —
any high-density silk material will do in a pinch, too.
If a disc has picked up liquid gunk — I warn you about liquids earlier in this
chapter, in the section “Holy Aqueous Tragedy, Batman!” (Avoiding Liquids) —
it’s a good idea to buy a flask of CD cleaning solution to help clean the toxic
waste.
Here’s an oft-repeated Mark’s Maxim:
If you carry your discs correctly and store them responsibly, you
simply don’t need the Rube Goldberg cleaning contraptions now on
the market!™
Keep ’Em Cool
One thing your CDs and DVDs share with pets and children: Never, never,
NEVER keep them trapped in a hot vehicle, especially in direct sunlight.
Owners of car CD players know how finicky these beasts can be, and no
matter what Aunt Matilda told you, discs can warp. (I haven’t seen one melt
yet, but I’m only 42 years old. There’s still plenty of time.)
How can you fix a warped disc? Forget trying to press it back into shape with
a thick, heavy hardbound book — coping with the disc is a better idea. Most
recorders are more tolerant of a warped disc than audio CD players are, so
you may get lucky enough to copy it (or at least create a disc image you can
use to record a new disc).
However, it’s best to just keep those discs cool in the first place!

cover the most popular recording software the world around in this book
(Easy CD & DVD Creator, Toast, and Drag-to-Disc) along with a number of
specialized programs, like Adobe Premiere and iDVD. With the programs I
focus on, you can record just about any type of CD and DVD under the sun.
These tools aren’t the only ones you can use, of course; you can swear by
other recording programs, for example (I don’t cover the software you swear
at), as well as utilities for converting images, creating thumbnails, editing dig-
ital audio and video, and much more. I mention classics like iMovie, WinAmp,
and Paint Shop Pro elsewhere, and a host of others are available.
In this chapter, I review my favorite programs that I recommend to everyone
with a recorder. I don’t present any $5,000 software packages here: Most of
these programs are shareware or cheap commercial software, and a few are
even free. I think that the programs in this chapter appeal to both novice and
experienced drive owners. I’ve used all these nifty tools on the PC and the
Mac, and I bet that you will find them invaluable too!

CDRWIN
Windows CD recording shareware from Golden Hawk Technology
(www.goldenhawk.com)
CDRWIN has been a shareware favorite of the CD recording community for
many years. The latest version now handles recordable and rewriteable DVD
formats. As you can see in Figure 18-1, the basic interface looks almost comi-
cal (pun intended); behind that deceptively simple façade, however, lies a
powerful recording engine! Also, the Golden Hawk Technology Web site is a
great place to start when tracking down firmware upgrades for older CD
recorders. (Think of firmware as the built-in “operating system” for your
recorder, which can be updated just like software.)
At the time I type these words, CDRWIN is an absolute steal at $39, and you
get versions for Windows 98, Windows Me, Windows NT, Windows 2000, and
Windows XP.
Along with the basic data and audio CD formats CDRWIN can record, it
includes these nifty features:
 Multiple recorder support, which allows you to use as many as 32 SCSI
and EIDE drives connected to the same computer to burn copies of the
same disc simultaneously. (Now you understand the attraction of those
SCSI device chains.) For more on SCSI and EIDE drives, flip to Chapter 4.
 Extraction of specific sectors on a data or audio CD, which comes in
handy when copying just a portion of a mixed-mode or CD Extra disc.
 Support for advanced CD and DVD recorders with the Kodak Disc
Transporter, which automates the recording of multiple copies of the
same disc.
 A complete selection of CD-Text fields for each track on an audio CD,
including performer, songwriter, composer, arranger, and a custom text
description.
 Extraction of audio files as both WAV and AIFF formats, which makes a
difference if you need to send digital audio files to a Macintosh owner.

For Macintosh owners, GraphicConverter represents the classic shareware
success story, and it’s now available for both the Classic Mac OS 9.2 and Mac
OS X (see Figure 18-2).
GraphicConverter can import more than 170 different formats of digital
images, and it can export almost 75. Although manual and automatic (batch)
conversion of image formats is its claim to fame, you can also
 Browse and view a folder’s worth of images from within the program.
 View images in a slideshow display.
 Perform basic image-editing chores, like cropping, rotation, reducing
and increasing color depth, and adjusting brightness and contrast.
 Whiz through mundane image-management tasks, like deleting, renam-
ing, and moving images from one folder to another.
For a mere $30, the powerful tool GraphicConverter can’t be beat!

lengthy laundry list of features. It can also play Video CDs and MPEG digital
video that you have stored on your hard drive. The most impressive

If you’re serious about DV editing and you’re lucky enough to own one of the
Apple Power Mac G4 or G5 lines (including my personal object of desire, the
dual-processor G5), it’s a good bet to settle on Final Cut Pro 4.0 as your editor
and effects generator of choice (see Figure 18-4).
The program offers blindingly fast performance on these machines, with
some of the fastest rendering times available on a personal computer.
Features like these are liable to make you faint:
 Easy drag-and-drop editing with real-time control over multiple sequences
 Support for direct FireWire DV, Beta SP, and HDTV
 OMF professional-level audio export
 Output to monitor, camera, VCR, or NTSC TV
 Output to streaming Web media (using Cleaner 5 EZ, which is included)
 Work with hundreds of layers, including text and still graphics

Musicmatch Jukebox Plus
Windows/Macintosh/Linux digital audio freeware/shareware “thing” from
Musicmatch (www.musicmatch.com)
Why do I call Musicmatch Jukebox Plus a digital audio “thing”? Because it
does an incredible amount of stuff, all related to digital audio (see Figure 18-5).
Naturally, it’s a great player for MP3s, WAVs, and audio CDs, and that’s the
main function of this program. I also find myself using it at least once or twice
a day, however, to take care of other audio chores. With Jukebox Plus version
8.1, you can
 Burn audio CDs from within the program
 Upload MP3 audio files to your portable MP3 player
 Rip songs from existing audio CDs
 Convert digital audio files from one format to another
 Convert digital audio files from one sampling rate to another
 Display cool light shows while your music plays
 Buy music online, either as tracks or entire albums
 Print audio CD covers and display album artwork on your desktop
You can register Jukebox Plus with all these features for $19.99, or you can

Retrospect

I absolutely promise that I don’t nag you again about backing up your system —
I just recommend Retrospect, as shown in Figure 18-6, to do it.
This program is easy and fast, and it recognizes internal and external
recorders as backup devices, including, I’m happy to say, all types of CD,
DVD, and DVD-RAM drives. Other features of this excellent program include
 The ability to create a bootable disaster-recovery disc that can restore
your system
 Efficient software compression to reduce the number of discs you need
 An easy-to-use source selection wizard to help you specify just what you
want backed up
 Encryption to secure your files
 Automatic launching of unattended backups
 Automatic rotation between multiple backup sets
Talk about a bargain — both the Windows and Mac versions sell for $129.95

Acrobat
Windows and Macintosh document imaging and archiving software from
Adobe (www.adobe.com)
You may be wondering why I chose to add Adobe Acrobat to this chapter.
After all, it doesn’t have anything directly to do with recording or multimedia
(see Figure 18-7). Ah, but what about documents? Many companies use CD
and DVD recorders to archive important material, like forms, advertising
materials, and even user manuals — and those documents have to be avail-
able for use not only on the Web, but also on both Macintosh and PCs.
That’s where Acrobat fits in, and that’s why it’s now one of the most successful
document standards. PDF files are very small, which explains their popularity
on the Web. In the Acrobat PDF format, you can create electronic versions of
your documents that look and print exactly the same on PCs, Macs, and even
those rabid Linux machines (complete with graphics and special fonts). The
reader is free, so anyone can view and print your documents without spend-
ing a nickel.
Plus, the standard is backward compatible. In other words, the current 
version 6.0 of Acrobat can read PDF files created with older versions of the
program, so you can rest assured that the documents you’re archiving to
CD-R will be readable in the future.
At the time of this writing, Acrobat 6.0 Standard is available from the Adobe
Web site for $299.

CloneDVD
Windows DVD-ROM duplication software from Elaborate Bytes
(www.elby.ch/en/products/clone_DVD/index.html)
Sometimes, you want to duplicate a copy-protected DVD movie for a perfectly
good, legal reason: a backup in case of disaster or a separate disc to take
with you on a trip, for example. CloneDVD is one of a new generation of DVD-
copying utilities that can compress a DVD movie to fit on a single recordable
DVD (see Figure 18-8).
CloneDVD, however, is not a mastering program, like Easy CD & DVD Creator
or Toast: You can’t choose individual files or folders to record with this
puppy. Its only purpose is to create exact backups of existing DVD movies.
CloneDVD can be purchased from the Elaborate Bytes Web site for about $60.
FireBurner
Windows/Linux CD recording shareware from IgD Software 
(www.fireburner.com)
Cool name, right? You bet, and this extremely popular shareware CD record-
ing program is just as cool as its name. Compared to the dozens of settings
and menu items in Easy CD & DVD Creator, FireBurner is a stripped-down
hotrod (see Figure 18-9). Yes, that’s really the main menu! FireBurner handles
data, audio, and mixed-mode CDs with ease. A Linux version is available.

Windows/Macintosh digital multimedia player/viewer from Apple
(www.apple.com)
If it’s multimedia, Apple QuickTime 6.4 can play it — that includes DV, MPEG,
and MOV (QuickTime format) video, digital audio, still images, 360-degree
panoramic images, and even Macromedia Flash animations! Plus, as you can
see in Figure 18-10, this program looks like a million bucks. (That’s important
for a multimedia player these days, as the Windows folks in Redmond are
finally figuring out.) If your recorded discs carry multimedia content,
QuickTime can show it.

Part VI: Appendixes 

Appendix B
Glossary
AAC: A relatively new digital audio file format popularized by Apple — AAC
files are the native format for music downloaded from the Apple Music Store,
and they can be played with iTunes or an iPod. AAC files are slightly smaller
than the familiar MP3 format and provide the same CD-quality stereo.
adapter card: A circuit board used to expand the abilities of your computer.
The card is plugged directly into the computer’s motherboard. For example,
you can add FireWire ports to a PC by installing a FireWire adapter card.
AIFF: The standard format for digital audio files for Macintosh computers.
Like WAV audio files on the PC side of the fence, AIFF files are used to store
CD-quality stereo, usually for transfer to an audio CD.
amorphous crystalline layer: A rather exotic name that describes the layer
where pits and lands are created in a CD-RW or rewriteable DVD. This layer
turns opaque when hit by a recorder’s laser beam, resulting in the same effect
as a pit on a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM manufactured in a factory. This layer can be
cleared by formatting the disc, allowing the disc to be used again.
backup: A copy of the information stored on your computer’s hard drive. In
case your hard drive fails or you accidentally delete important files, you can
restore valuable programs and data by using your backup. Back up often — it’s
the smart power user thing to do, and I’ll keep nagging you until you back up.
binary: The language used by computers to communicate (with hardware,
software, and other computers). It’s not a particularly subtle language
because binary has only two values: 0 (zero) and 1.
BIOS: (Basic Input/Output System) Your PC’s BIOS controls basic functions,
like the configuration of your hardware and the low-level functions on your
motherboard. You can display and change the BIOS settings for your PC by
pressing a specific key or key combination during the boot sequence.
bootable CD-ROM: A bootable CD that includes everything necessary to boot
a PC or Macintosh without a hard drive: the operating system, support files,
and configuration files. In the PC world, bootable CD-ROMs are recorded in El
Torito format; your PC’s BIOS must support bootable CD-ROMs to use one of
these discs.

burnproof drive: A feature that eliminates almost all recording errors caused
by multitasking. A burnproof drive can interrupt the recording process when-
ever you’re running another program that could seriously affect the perfor-
mance of your computer (like Adobe Photoshop or Microsoft Outlook). When
your computer is ready to continue recording, the drive automatically resumes
burning.
byte: A single character of text stored in your computer’s memory or hard
drive or on a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM.
caddy: A thin plastic box (rather than a tray) used to hold the disc on older
CD-ROM drives and recorders. These days, drives that use caddies are con-
sidered inconvenient, anachronistic dinosaurs.
case: The metal frame that holds all the components. Like jukeboxes, all com-
puter cases can be opened for servicing (some with a separate cover that
you can remove and others with a hinged door).
CD Extra: (Also called CD Enhanced.) A mixed-mode CD-ROM with both audio
and data tracks. The audio track is recorded first, allowing a CD Extra disc to
be played in a standard audio CD player.
CD-R: (Compact Disc-Recordable) The standard recordable disc, typically
capable of storing about 700MB of computer data or about 80 minutes of digi-
tal audio. CD-Rs can be recorded only once; unlike a CD-RW, a CD-R can’t be
reused.
CD-ROM: (Compact Disc Read-Only Memory) A compact disc used on a com-
puter rather than an audio CD player. CD-ROMs can be commercially manu-
factured or recorded on your computer using a CD-R or CD-RW drive.
CD-ROM XA: The standard recording format for multisession discs. Note that
older CD-ROM drives may not be able to read CD-ROM XA discs.
CD-RW: (Compact Disc-Rewriteable) A reusable recordable CD-ROM that can
be erased. CD-RWs can’t be used in most older CD-ROM drives, and they can’t
be used in older audio CD players.
CD-Text: A feature that encodes the disc name, artist name, and each track
name when you record an audio CD. If your audio CD player (or your audio
CD player program on your computer) supports CD-Text, it displays this
information while the disc is playing.
data buffer: Internal memory built into every CD and DVD recorder. This
memory temporarily holds data transferred from your hard drive until it’s
ready to be recorded. The larger the data buffer in your recorder, the more
efficient the flow of data (and the less likely you are to encounter buffer
underrun errors during recording).
300
Part VI: Appendixes 

defragment: To order files on your hard drive by rewriting them in contigu-
ous form. After a drive has been defragmented, files take less time to read,
and your hard drive’s performance is improved.
digital audio extraction: (Also called ripping.) The process of converting a
digital audio track (a song, in other words) from an existing audio CD to an
MP3, WAV, AAC, or AIFF file on your computer’s hard drive. Depending on the
recording software that you’re using, you may have to do this before you can
record that track to a new audio CD.
DIP switches: A bank of tiny sliding or rocker switches you use to configure
devices, like hard drives and recorders. Use the tip of a pencil to set the
switches into the correct position.
Disc-at-Once: The author’s favorite recording mode (can you tell?), where the
recorder writes the entire disc at once (without turning the recording laser
off between tracks). Using Disc-at-Once may help you avoid audible clicks
between tracks when playing recorded audio CDs on some players. Virtually
all recorders manufactured in the past three or four years can record in Disc-
at-Once mode.
disc image: A file saved to your hard drive that contains all the data required
to record a CD or DVD. Disc images are good for creating multiple copies of a
disc over a long period. You should record from a disc image if you’re experi-
encing Buffer Underrun errors while recording.
DVD authoring: The process of designing, creating, and editing an interactive
DVD-ROM for personal use or commercial sale. Authoring usually involves
building a DVD menu, editing digital video, and adding still images and com-
puter programs.
DVD-A: (DVD-Audio) The DVD recording format due to replace the audio com-
pact disc. A DVD-A can store anywhere from two to four hours of high-fidelity
music along with video clips.
DVD-R: (DVD recordable) A recordable DVD that can hold 4.7GB. DVD-Rs can
be recorded only once. Virtually all DVD players can use DVD-Rs, so they’re
popular for folks creating their own DVD-Video discs.
DVD+R: (Another form of DVD recordable.) A recordable DVD that can hold
4.7GB. DVD+Rs are very similar to DVD-Rs, but the two formats are not compat-
ible (so you can’t record a DVD-R in a DVD+R drive). DVD+Rs can be recorded
only once. Most late-model DVD players can use DVD+Rs.
DVD-RAM: A reusable recordable DVD that can hold 5.2GB on each side. Only
the latest DVD players can read DVD-RAMs, but they’re still great for system
backups and data storage. Like a CD-RW, a DVD-RAM must be formatted before
you can use it.
301
Appendix B: Glossary

DVD-ROM: (Originally short for digital versatile disc, and now also called a
digital video disc by those with overactive imaginations.) Rapidly becoming
the standard for storing movies and digital video, a type of disc that stores
4.7GB to 17GB in the same physical dimensions as a standard CD-ROM.
DVD-RW: A relatively new DVD format, DVD-RWs can hold 4.7GB on each side,
and they’re reusable. However, unlike the unlimited lifespan of DVD-RAMs,
DVD-RWs can be rewritten only 1,000 times. On the plus side, DVD-RWs can
be read in most DVD players.
DVD+RW: Another recently-introduced DVD format, DVD+RWs are rewrite-
able, and they can hold 4.7GB on each side. Unlike DVD-RWs, DVD+RWs can
be re-recorded many thousands of times. DVD+RWs can be read in most DVD
players.
DVD-V: (DVD-Video) The DVD recording format used to produce movies on
DVD-ROM (by using digital video in MPEG format). All home DVD players
read DVD-V. A DVD-V can hold 4.7GB of digital video and data on each side.
dye layer: A layer of light-sensitive dye in a CD-R that turns opaque when
struck by a recorder’s laser beam. The result acts the same as a pit on a 
factory-made CD-ROM. The dye layer in a CD-R can’t be turned clear again,
so a CD-R can be recorded only once.
EIDE: (Enhanced Integrated Drive Electronics) The interface used by virtually
all PCs and new Mac computers for connecting internal devices, like hard
drives, CD-ROM drives, and recorders. Most PCs have a primary and sec-
ondary EIDE connector; each connector supports two devices.
El Torito format: The somewhat silly name for the format standard used to
record bootable CD-ROMs.
emergency disc eject hole: A hole that allows you to eject the disc manually
even if the drive has locked up or isn’t working Every recorder and read-only
drive has one of these tiny holes. If you can’t eject your disc, you can force it
out (or force the tray to extend) by pushing a paperclip into the eject hole.
external recorder: A CD or DVD recorder that you add outside your com-
puter. It’s connected to your computer by a cable and may use a separate
power supply. USB and FireWire drives are always external, and a SCSI drive
may be external.
FAQ: (Frequently Asked Questions) A text or Adobe PDF file created by some-
one who knows the answers to the most common questions posed on a par-
ticular subject. The manufacturer of your recorder may post a list of FAQs on
its Web site, answering technical support and installation questions from new
drive owners.
302
Part VI: Appendixes 

FireWire: (Otherwise blessed with the rather cryptic name IEEE-1394.) The
most popular type of connection for external devices that require high-speed
data transfer, including DV camcorders and CD and DVD recorders. Like USB,
FireWire devices can be connected and unplugged without rebooting the com-
puter, but FireWire hardware is generally more expensive. All new Macintosh
computers come with FireWire ports built-in, and you can add a FireWire
adapter card to your PC. Two different types of FireWire exist now: the origi-
nal FireWire 400 and FireWire 800, which is twice as fast. Either flavor is fine
for connecting a CD or DVD recorder.
formatting: Preparing a blank CD-RW, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, or DVD-RAM for use
(similar to formatting one of those old-fashioned hard drives). The disc can’t
be used until it has been successfully formatted, and formatting erases the
existing contents of a disc.
gigabyte: A unit of data equal to 1,024MB (megabytes), usually abbreviated
as GB. DVDs can hold several gigabytes.
hard drive: A magnetic storage device that provides a permanent home for
computer programs and data (at least until it crashes). Most hard drives are
internal, but you can also get external SCSI, USB, and FireWire models.
HFS: (Hierarchical File System) The CD-ROM file system used by Macintosh
computers.
HTML: (Hypertext Markup Language) The programming language used to
create Web pages. You can also use HTML to create CD-ROM menus.
HTML Editor: A program used to create or edit Web pages, which are actually
HTML files made up of commands. You can edit these commands directly by
using a character-based editor (like Windows Notepad or Arachnophilia), or
you can use a visual HTML editor, like Microsoft FrontPage.
incremental multisession disc: A disc that adds data imported from the pre-
vious session to files recorded in a new session (effectively updating the data
in the previous session).
interface: An extremely fancy engineering-style technical word for
connection — as in methods of connecting internal and external devices
to your computer. Common interfaces for CD and DVD recorders include
EIDE, SCSI, USB, and FireWire.
internal drive: A recorder that fits inside your computer’s case; other inter-
nal devices can include hard drives, floppy drives, or Zip drives.
303
Appendix B: Glossary

ISO 9660: The most compatible CD-ROM or DVD-ROM file system around.
Virtually every computer and operating system can read an ISO 9660 disc,
which makes it the best choice for recording cross-platform discs. On the
downside, ISO 9660 limits the length of filenames and the number of direc-
tories and subdirectories that you can use in your disc layout.
jewel box: The familiar hinged, plastic storage case that holds a compact disc.
Joliet file system: The CD-ROM or DVD-ROM file system used for Windows. It
allows long filenames with periods and spaces.
jumper: A small wire-and-plastic electrical crossover used to configure a cir-
cuit board or internal device in your computer. You can change the settings
by moving the jumper to connect different sets of pins.
kilobyte: A unit of data equal to 1,024 bytes, usually abbreviated as K.
land: A spot under the clear surface of a CD or DVD that reflects laser light.
If the disc is manufactured, lands are the flat areas between the pits; on
recorded CDs and DVDs, pits are the clear areas between the opaque pits.
laser read head: The combination of the CD-ROM’s or DVD-ROM’s laser lens,
prism, and optical pickup. Together, they allow your CD-ROM or DVD-ROM
drive to read a disc.
laser write head: A laser beam on a recorder that can be toggled to high and
low power levels.
master: The setting for an EIDE device that designates it as the primary device
on that EIDE cable. An EIDE recorder can be set to “single drive, master unit”
(if it’s the only drive on the cable) or “multiple drive, master unit” (if it’s the
primary drive with another device on the cable).
megabyte: A unit of data equal to 1,024K (kilobytes), usually abbreviated
as MB.
mixed-mode disc: A CD-ROM with both digital audio tracks and a data track.
On a standard mixed-mode disc, the first track is computer data, and the fol-
lowing tracks are recorded as digital audio. Mixed-mode discs are often used
for storing games. Although a mixed-mode disc can’t be played on a standard
audio CD player, you can record a CD Extra mixed-mode disc that is compati-
ble with audio CD players.
motherboard: The main circuit board in a computer. The motherboard is
where you find the computer’s CPU (or processor), the memory modules,
and the EIDE or SCSI connectors. You can plug adapter cards into the mother-
board to expand your computer’s functionality.
304
Part VI: Appendixes 

Mozart, Wolfgang Amadeus: My favorite classical composer and a doggone
good piano player to boot. He created the world’s most beautiful music, and
I’m proud to say that I’ve collected every single note he ever composed on
audio CD.
MP3: The most popular format for digital audio on the Internet. MP3 files are
very small in size, provide CD-quality stereo, and they’re often used to record
audio CDs.
MPEG: (Moving Pictures Expert Group) The video format used on commercial
DVD-Video movie discs. MPEG is also a popular format for video transmitted
over the Web.
multisession: A type of disc that stores multiple separate recording sessions.
An incremental multisession disc allows access to only the latest session, and a
multivolume multisession disc allows access to all the sessions (one at a time).
Audio CD players and older CD-ROM drives can use only multivolume discs.
multitask: To run multiple programs on your computer at one time. If you
experience problems recording a disc while multitasking, consider using
packet writing recording or upgrading to a drive that uses burnproof technol-
ogy (or just stop recording while using other programs).
multivolume multisession disc: A disc that stores data in separate volumes,
each of which can be accessed one at a time. Audio CD players and older
CD-ROM drives can read only the last session on a multivolume multisession
disc.
network: A system of computers connected to each other to exchange data
and share devices, like printers, modems, and recorders.
Orange Book: The international engineering standard that specifies the file
structure of recorded CD-ROMs or CD-Rs.
overburn: To record more data than the rated maximum capacity of a CD-R.
For instance, your drive might be able to record 76 minutes of music on a
standard 74-minute CD-R. The amount you can overburn depends on your
recorder and the specific brand of discs that you’re using.
packet writing: (Also called UDF.) A recording method that allows you to drag
and drop files directly to the recorder’s drive icon just as you would copy files
to a floppy drive. Virtually all CD and DVD recorders can record discs by using
packet writing.
parallel port: A port usually used to connect a printer, although it can be
used to connect external devices, like a Zip drive, scanner, or CD recorder.
305
Appendix B: Glossary

Although some ancient CD recorders connected to your parallel port, I don’t
recommend them: They’re as slow as an arthritic turtle and more prone to
problems than USB and FireWire drives.
pit: A spot under the clear surface of a disc that scatters light and doesn’t
reflect it. If the disc is manufactured, pits are actual depressions within the
disc. On recorded CDs and DVDs, pits are simply opaque spots within the dye
(or crystalline) layer.
RAM: (Random Access Memory) The temporary storehouse for the data
that your computer and its programs need to run. As you probably know,
however, turning off your computer causes you to lose the data that’s stored
in RAM (hence the development of the hard drive, which stores that data 
permanently).
Red Book: The international engineering standard that specifies the file
structure of audio CDs. An audio CD that you’ve recorded must comply 
with Red Book standards to be compatible with your audio CD player.
refurbished: Used or returned hardware that has been “fixed” (hopefully
by the manufacturer) and resold at a much lower price. (I would say selling
refurbished merchandise is also called a SCAM, but that’s already in this 
glossary.) Let the buyer beware, as someone once said.
restocking fee: (Also called a rip-off.) A fee charged by most online and local
computer stores if you return an item — even if it’s unopened.
SCAM: (SCSI Configured Automatically) A feature that allows your SCSI adapter
card to automatically allocate SCSI ID numbers to all SCAM-compliant SCSI
devices. SCAM makes things easier for both you and your PC.
screen printing: A printing process that adds layers of different-color inks
through a series of stencils to create a single multicolored image. Most manu-
factured CD and DVD labels are screen printed.
SCSI: (Small Computer Systems Interface) A popular adapter choice for high-
speed internal and external devices, like hard drives, recorders, and scanners.
SCSI adapters are available for both Macs and PCs. (By the way, it is indeed
pronounced “skuzzy” — really!)
SCSI ID: A unique number assigned to a SCSI device that identifies it.
Assigning the same SCSI ID to two SCSI devices will probably result in a
locked computer.
secure connection: An encrypted connection between you and a Web site
that helps prevent your personal data from being intercepted. Whenever
306
Part VI: Appendixes 

you’re buying something on the Web, frequent only online stores that offer a
secure connection for your credit card number.
slave: The setting for an EIDE device that designates it as the secondary
device on that EIDE cable. An EIDE recorder can be set to “multiple drive,
slave unit” (if it’s the secondary drive with another device on the cable).
slideshow: Just like the slideshows that Uncle Milton used to bore the entire
family during reunions — only now the images are displayed on your computer
monitor or your TV. The photographs are files stored on your hard drive or a
DVD, and your computer or DVD player, rather than a clunky projector, does
the work.
static electricity: The archenemy of any computer hardware; a type of electric-
ity that can destroy any circuit board in a flash (pun intended, unfortunately).
Always touch the metal chassis (the metal framework) of your computer
before handling any internal computer device or adapter card to discharge
any static electricity on your body.
terminator: Both sides of a SCSI device chain must be terminated by using a
switch or small resistor pack. Without correct termination, your SCSI devices
don’t work.
thumbwheel: A rotating wheel that you can use to select the SCSI ID on a
SCSI recorder.
track: On an audio CD, a single section of audio (typically a single song) that
you can jump to immediately. On a data CD, a track is simply a section of the
CD-ROM that contains data (many CD-ROMs contain only a single data track
that holds all the files).
Track-at-Once: The default recording mode for most recording software. The
laser beam writes each track one at a time, and the recording laser is turned
off between tracks.
UDF: (Universal Disc Format) See packet writing.
USB: (Universal Serial Bus) A type of connection used to add external devices,
like recorders and printers, to both PC and Macintosh computers. The USB
port offers Plug and Play support, so you can connect a USB device without
rebooting your computer. Two versions of USB devices are on the market:
The older USB 1.1 is supported on most PCs and Macs (but it’s not suitable
for high-speed CD or DVD burning), but the new USB 2.0 standard is much
faster (and works perfectly for connecting any CD or DVD recorder).
Video CD: A CD recording format that can store high-quality MPEG video for
viewing on a Video CD player.
307
Appendix B: Glossary

virtual memory: A method that uses hard drive space to “increase” the
amount of memory available to your computer. Both Windows and Mac OS
use virtual memory to run programs that would normally fail because your
computer had insufficient RAM.
WAV: The Windows standard format for CD-quality digital sound files. WAV
files can be played directly from your hard drive or recorded as part of an
audio CD.
WYSIWYG: An absolutely ridiculous acronym that stands for What You See Is
What You Get, now taken to mean a visual or object-oriented computer appli-
cation. (If you know who created this travesty, please let me know so that I
can send the culprit a rotten tomato.)
X factor: The author’s catchy term for the figure used to indicate the speed of
CD and DVD recorders (as well as read-only CD-ROM and DVD-ROM drives).
It represents the multiplier of the data transfer rate for the first single-speed
drives. For example, a 24X CD-ROM drive is twenty-four times faster than an
original single-speed CD-ROM drive.
